<ABSTRACT>
The drawbacks to administering a sequence of locations to which calls 
placed to a subscriber's personal telephone number may be routed for personal 

communication service are overcome by a) storing pre-defined mnemonic audible 
tags for association with telephone numbers prior to any interactions with the 

subscriber, b) offering the subscriber a choice of the pre-defined mnemonic audible 
tags by speaking them to him, c) receiving an indication of the mnemonic audible 

tag selected by the subscriber, d) receiving signals indicating a telephone number 
supplied by the subscriber; and e) storing the received telephone number information 

in association with the selected mnemonic audible tag. The mnemonic audible tags 
are then used in place of their respective associated telephone numbers in 

administering the sequence of locations. A mnemonic audible tag is not simply an 
ordering designation -- such as 1, 2, 3, ... , N; first number, second number, third 

number, ... , Nth number; A, B, C, ... --but instead is a meaningful word indicative of 
the actual location, person, or service, e.g., "office", "neighbor" or "AT
&
T 
voicemail", to which a call to the personal telephone number is to be completed. 

Advantageously, administering a sequence of locations is accomplished by simply 
manipulating friendly, meaningful, easy to understand terms rather than 

cumbersome, meaningless, telephone numbers or codes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to personal communications, and more
particularly, to administering the series of telephone numbers for destinations to
which incoming calls to a person's personal telephone number should be routed to at
a particular time.Personal communication service (PCS) is a service in which subscribers,
rather than locations or telephone stations, are assigned a personal telephone number.
Calls placed to a subscriber's personal telephone number are routed to the subscriber
at a telephone near that subscriber's current location. In order to provide a
subscriber with such a personal communication service, e.g., as disclosed in United
States Patent No. 4,313,035, issued to Jordan, et al., the system providing the service
(PCS system) must be supplied with the telephone number of a telephone near the
subscriber's current location to which it should route calls to his personal telephone
number. Each time the subscriber changes his location, the telephone number to
which calls placed to his personal telephone number are routed must be changed.
This requires the subscriber to call into the PCS system and to supply the telephone
number to which his calls should currently be routed. Constantly having to call in to
the PCS system can be tiresome, and supplying a ten-digit telephone number each
time a subscriber changes his location is cumbersome.To overcome these drawbacks, one prior art solution is to program a
scheduled sequence of telephone numbers at which the personal telephone service
subscriber can be reached over a period of time. When a call is made to the
subscriber, the PCS system picks the specific number in the sequence that is
appropriate for the call and routes the call to that destination. In order to administer
the sequence, the subscriber places a call to a live attendant. The live attendant
collects the telephone numbers to which calls to the subscriber's personal telephone
number should be routed, along with the corresponding time schedule, and enters
this information into the PCS system by way of a computer-like terminal. This
solution suffers from the disadvantages of being costly and of discouraging the
owner of the personal telephone number from calling, because the interaction with
the live attendant takes a relatively large amount of time.Another prior art approach is to straightforwardly automate the
functions of the live attendant. However, doing so requires a person who is
administering a personal telephone number to supply, receive, and keep track of an 
unwieldy quantity

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a telephone network for defining the destinations to which said
telephone network attempts to complete telephone calls placed to a subscriber's

personal telephone number, the method comprising the steps of:

a. storing a plurality of pre-defined mnemonic audible tags for association with
telephone numbers prior to any interactions with said subscriber;
b. offering a choice of said pre-defined mnemonic audible tags by speaking then;
c. receiving an indication of the one of said mnemonic audible tags selected by
said subscriber;
d. receiving signals indicating a telephone number supplied by said subscriber;
and
e. storing said received telephone number information is association with said
selected mnemonic audible tag.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said indication is an identifier
corresponding to said selected mnemonic audible tag.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said indication is a signal received within
a predetermined time after the start of the speaking of a mnemonic audible tag.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein said mnemonic audible tags
each have a respective corresponding identifier and wherein, in said last mentioned

storing step, said association is created between said selected mnemonic audible tag,
its corresponding identifier and said received telephone number.
A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said identifiers are indicated by signals
generated in response to said subscriber pressing keys on a telephone dial pad.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein steps (b) through (e) are
repeated at least once so that there is information stored creating associations

between at least two mnemonic audible tags of said plurality and their respective
received telephone numbers, and wherein said method further includes the steps of: 


offering said subscriber a choice of said at least two mnemonic audible tags by
speaking them;
making a determination of the one of said at least two mnemonic audible tags
picked by said subscriber; and
adding said picked at least one of said mnemonic audible tags to an ordered set of
destinations to which said telephone network attempts to complete telephone calls

placed to said subscriber's personal telephone number.
A method as claimed in claim 6, further including the step of:

offering a choice of pre-defined mnemonic audible tags from a second plurality by
speaking them;
making a determination of the one of said mnemonic audible tags of second
plurality that is selected by said subscriber; and
storing information that creates an association between said selected mnemonic
audible tag of said second plurality and said ordered set.
A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein said mnemonic audible tags of said second
plurality each have a respective corresponding identifier and wherein, in said storing

step that creates said association between said selected mnemonic audible tag of said
second plurality and said ordered set, said association further includes said

corresponding identifier of said selected mnemonic audible tag of said second
plurality.
A method as claimed in claim 8 wherein said identifiers corresponding to said
mnemonic audible tags of said second plurality are indicated by signals generated in

response to said subscriber pressing keys on a telephone dial pad.
