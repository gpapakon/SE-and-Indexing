<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optically active azole 
derivatives, their production and use. The optically active 
azole derivatives of the invention are useful for an anti-fungal 
therapeutic agent (especially in mycosis). A method for manufacturing optically active azole 
derivatives having a triazolone group by reacting a triazolone 
derivative with an oxirane-triazole derivative in the 
presence of sodium hydride is described in EPA-567,982. It has been demanded to develop a practical method for 
the production of optically active azole derivatives in a 
short time, by simple processes and with high yield and 
purity. Various compounds have been reported already as anti-fungal 
agents (for example, EPA-122,693, EPA-122,056 and 
EPA-332,387). These compounds are, however, not satisfactory 
in their therapeutic effects from the viewpoint of anti-fungal  
 
activity, antifungal spectrum, side effect and pharmacokinetics. Conventional antifungal agents do not exhibit sufficient 
therapeutic effect and, in addition, there are many 
problems on side effects, pharmacokinetics, superinfection 
and acquisition of drug-resistance. For solving such problems, it would be clear that 
compounds having higher safety, better absorption in vivo 
and more potent antifungal activity are desired as therapeutic 
agents. The present invention provides: 
A) a process for preparing a compound of the formula (IV) or 
a salt thereof: 
 
, wherein R¹ is an optionally substituted aliphatic or 
aromatic hydrocarbon residue or an optionally substituted 
aromatic heterocyclic group, one of Y and Z is a nitrogen 
atom and the other is a methine group which may be optionally 
substituted with a lower alkyl group, Ar is a halogenated 
phenyl group, and (R) shows that the carbon atom marked with  
 
(R) has (R)-configuration,
 
   which comprises reacting a compound of the formula (I) 
or a salt thereof: 
 
, wherein the symbols have the same meanings as defined 
above,
 
   with a compound of the formula (III): 
 
, wherein R² is a lower alkyl group or an optionally substituted 
phenyl group and the other symbols have the same 
meanings as defined above, B) a process for preparing a compound of the formula (IV) or 
a salt thereof: 
 
, wherein R¹ is an optionally substituted aliphatic or 
aromatic hydrocarbon residue or an optionally substituted 
aromatic heterocyclic group, one of Y and Z is a nitrogen  
 
atom and the other is a methine group which may be optionally 
substituted with a lower alkyl group, Ar is a halogenated 
phe
