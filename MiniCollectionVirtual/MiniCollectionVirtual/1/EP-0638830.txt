<ABSTRACT>
An optical scanning device for leading a laser 
beam emitted from a semiconductor laser diode through a 

collimator lens, an imaging lens, and a cylindrical lens 
to a plurality of reflecting surfaces of a rotatable 

polygon mirror, and scanning a surface to be scanned 
movable in a vertical scanning direction with the laser 

beam reflected on the reflecting surfaces of the polygon 
mirror and transmitted through a correcting lens. The 

optical centers of the semiconductor laser diode, the 
collimator lens, the cylindrical lens, a return mirror, 

and the correcting lens are located in a plane 
containing an axis of rotation of the polygon mirror. 

The semiconductor laser diode, the collimator lens, and 
the cylindrical lens are located over an upper surface 

of the polygon mirror. Accordingly, an optical system 
can be formed in symmetry with respect to a center axis 

of an optical path of a horizontal scanning light beam 
from the polygon mirror without interference of the 

semiconductor laser diode, etc. with the optical path of 
the horizontal scanning light beam. Thus, the size and 

weight of the optical scanning device can be reduced, 
and the optical characteristics and the productivity of 

the optical scanning device can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
scanning device employing a laser beam utilizable in a
laser printer, laser facsimile, digital copying machine,
etc.An electrophotographic process has been
developed as a simple and high-quality printing process
in recent years, and an optical scanning device is
conventionally known as a device capable of realizing
this process. For example, a post-objective type of
optical scanning device has such a structure that a
collimator lens, an imaging lens, and a cylindrical lens
are sequentially located on an optical path of a laser
beam emitted from a semiconductor laser diode; that a
plurality of reflecting surfaces of a polygon mirror
rotatably supported by a drive motor are located on an
optical path of the laser beam transmitted through the
cylindrical lens; that a correcting lens is located on
an optical path of a horizontal scanning light beam from
the polygon mirror; and that a surface to be scanned 
that is movable in a vertical scanning direction of a
rotatable photosensitive drum is located on an optical
path of the light beam transmitted through the
correcting lens.In order to improve the optical
characteristics of such an optical scanning device, it
is necessary to position various optical components with
a high accuracy. In an optical scanning device
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 63-210807,
for example, a light emitting unit having a
semiconductor laser diode, a collimator lens, etc.
integrated together, a drive motor for rotatably
supporting a polygon mirror, a reflecting mirror, a
correcting lens, etc. are mounted in a single, flattened
box-shaped housing.The above-mentioned optical scanning device
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Sho 63-210807
will now be more described. To prevent interference of
the light emitting unit with the optical path of the
horizontal scanning light beam from the polygon mirror,
the light emitting unit is located aside the polygon
mirror. The light emitting unit is designed so that the
optical path of the horizontal scanning light beam from
the polygon mirror is deflected by the reflecting mirror 
to emerge out of the housing. Accordingly, a surface to
be scanned as of a photosensitive drum is located under
the housing. In this optical scanning device, the tilt
of the reflecting surfaces of the polygon mirror is
corrected by the correcting lens. To correct the tilt,
the laser beam must be imaged in the vertical scanning
direction on the reflecting surfaces of the polygon
mirror, and this imaging
