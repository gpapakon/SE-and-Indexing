<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic toner includes at least binding resin 
(for instance, a styrene-acryl resin) and magnetic 

powder (for instance, Mn-Zn ferrite or Ni-Zn 
ferrite) having a saturation magnetization of at 

least 50 emu/g and a coercive force as measured 
under the magnetic field of 8 kA/m not exceeding 40 A/cm. 
An image formed by using this magnetic toner 
has high quality and is free of tailing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic toner 
used in an electrophotographic image formation 
method. In many cases, image formation for copiers, 
printers, etc., employs electrophotography in which 
a latent electrostatic image is formed on a charged 
photoreceptor surface, then developed with a 
developing agent. The photoreceptor surface is 
charged by a corona discharge, or by a conductive 
roller or other means, and a latent image is formed 
by exposure to light emitted from a semiconductor 
laser, an LED array, or other light sources. Magnetic brush development is generally 
employed. A developing agent supplied to a 
developing roller (consisting of a non-magnetic 
sleeve and a permanent magnet member incorporated 
therein) opposed to the photoreceptor surface is 
conveyed to the developing region by, for instance, 
rotating the sleeve. An electrostatic latent image 
is visualized by sliding a magnetic brush formed on 
the sleeve on the image bearing surface  
 
(photoreceptor surface) such that the former 
frictionally contacts the latter. Then, a toner 
image is transferred onto, for instance, a plain 
sheet and fused thereon to become a final image. Two types of developing agents are known: a 
two-component developing agent including toner and 
carrier as main components, and a one-component 
developing agent including toner as a main component 
but not carrier. In many cases, each of the two 
types employs magnetic toner including a binding 
resin and magnetic powder as main components. As magnetic characteristics, the magnetic toner 
must have a large saturation magnetization, 
particularly, when it is used in the one-component 
developing agent, because magnetic brush filaments 
must be high. Further, magnetic toner should have a 
large coercive force to provide superior developing 
agent transfer, flow, and cohesiveness. It is 
desirable that magnetic toner provide a solid black 
color alone, or with least amounts of coloring 
agents added. To satisfy the above magnetic characteristics, 
the requirement of a solid black color, and other 
factors, magnetic toners in current use generally 
include magnetite (Fe3O4) as a magnetic powder. In 
general, magnetite for this purpose has a saturation 
magnetization ( σ s ) of 60-90 emu/g and a coercive  
 
force (iHc) of 40 to 320 A/cm. However, when conventional magnetic toner 
having the above composition is used as the 
developing agent alone or with a magnetic carrier, 
although it can provide a sufficient image density, 
resolution, etc.,
