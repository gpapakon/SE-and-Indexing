<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tyre tread and a tyre tread composition 
particularly suitable for a high performance tyre. 
It provides a vulcanisable rubber composition suitable for the 
manufacture of the tread of a high performance tyre, the composition 

comprising a styrene-butadiene rubber, oil, vulcanisation agent, filler and 
coupling agent, the filler comprising silica and the coupling agent being at 

least bi-functional whereby it can react with the silica and with the rubber 
polymer. 
The invention also provides a tyre having a tread formed by the 
vulcanisation of such a composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tyre tread and a tyre tread composition 
and is particularly concerned with a tread for a high performance tyre. It has been the practice for many years to formulate and compound 
special rubber compositions for use in the moulding of tyre treads for tyres 
to be used for a high performance application. Although properties such 
as rolling resistance and abrasion resistance have some significance for 
such treads, a property of major importance is grip and particularly grip in 
wet conditions. Although much development and research has been expended to 
improve wet grip of tyre treads, there is still room for further improvement 
and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a tyre tread 
composition which can be provided to form a tread of improved wet grip. Accordingly, in one aspect the invention provides a vulcanisable 
rubber composition suitable for the manufacture of the tread of a high 
performance tyre, the composition comprising a styrene-butadiene rubber, 
oil, vulcanisation agent, filler and coupling agent, the filler comprising 
silica and the coupling agent being at least bi-functional whereby it can 
react with the silica and with the polymer.  In another aspect the invention provides a high performance tyre 
having a tread formed from a vulcanised composition of the immediately 
preceding paragraph. The reaction between the silica and the coupling agent may take 
place in situ during the mechanical blending of the ingredients of the 
composition and/or during the vulcanisation stage or the silica may be pre-coupled 
with the coupling agent before incorporation into the composition. Normally, the reaction between the coupling agent and the polymer 
will be during the vulcanisation stage when the composition is heated to 
vulcanisation temperature. The SBR polymer may be emulsion- or solution-polymerised and 
should preferably contain from 20 to 50 percent, especially from 30-45 per 
cent, of styrene. It is preferably present in the composition in at least 25% 
by weight, especially at least 50% by weight, of the rubbery polymer 
constituent of the composition and may, if desired, be substantially the 
entire rubbery polymer constituent. Other rubbers that may be included in the composition with the SBR 
include any suitable for use in a tyre tread. For example, a vinyl 
polybutadiene, a vinyl isoprene or a polybutadiene rubber may be 
included.  The silica should be present in an amount of from 15 up to 160 parts 
by weight per hundred parts
