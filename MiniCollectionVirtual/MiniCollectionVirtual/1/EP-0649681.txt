<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an electrostatic separation and classification apparatus (20) 
which includes a pair of electrode unit mechanisms (21, 22) having spaced 

electrodes (28, 29), insulative endless belts (30, 31) covering opposite surfaces of 
the electrodes (28, 29) and opposed to each other for feeding in circulation, and 

deposit scratching members (38, 39) remote from a position in which an 
electrostatic field produced between the electrodes (28, 29) works and in contact 

with outer surfaces of the endless belts (30, 31) throughout their width, respectively, 
thereby increasing the rate of operation and safety.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatic separation and classification
apparatus for separating and classifying a mixture of powders and/or particles
of materials such as resin, rubber and the like.This type of electrostatic separation and classification apparatus includes an
apparatus which makes use of frictional electrification and electrostatic field. For
instance, an apparatus shown in Fig. 7 comprises a pair of opposed electrodes 1,
2 disposed in predetermined spaced relation, a charged material-to-be-classified
supply portion 3 disposed above spacing between the electrodes 1 and 2, and a
collecting portion 4 disposed below spacing between the electrodes 1 and 2.A high voltage is applied between the electrodes 1 and 2 to produce an
electrostatic field therebetween. In this state, a mixture of powders and/or particles
of previously charged resin, rubber and the like is supplied from the supply portion
3 into the electrostatic field.The powders and/or particles of the mixture falling downward by gravity are
attracted to the electrodes of their opposite polarities and drop while separated from
each other in rightward and leftward directions and are then collected in the
collecting portion 4 having partition walls 4a and 4b in such a manner as to be
classified depending upon different fall positions. Such an apparatus includes an apparatus of the type having vertically
extending, parallel opposed flat electrodes which is disclosed by Kali und Salz
Entsorgung in Germany. (See "Nikkei New Material", November 16,1992, pp. 32-33.)Another apparatus shown in Fig. 8 comprises a drum 6 rotating in a
predetermined direction and a rotary electrode 7 obliquely above and spaced apart
from the drum 6. The apparatus of Fig. 8 is adapted such that a charged mixture
is supplied from a charged material-to-be-classified supply portion 8 above the
drum, and the mixture falling in the electrostatic field between the drum 6 and the
rotary electrode 7 is separated and classified into attracted, repelled, and
intermediate materials in accordance with differences in polarity of the charged
powders and/or particles of the mixture.In Fig. 8, the reference numerals 9 and 10 designate separating plates, 11 and
12 designate collecting containers, 13 designates a scratching piece, and 14
designates a guide element.However, in the prior art structure of Fig. 7, fine powder of the mixture and
dust attracted by static electricity adhere on surfaces of the electrodes 1 and 2
during continuous operation of the apparatus.Such

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (20) for separating and classifying powders and/or particles by
using different fall positions depending upon difference in polarity of said powders

and/or particles which are charged, said apparatus comprising:

a pair (28, 29) of spaced electrodes for producing an electrostatic field therebetween;
endless belts (30, 31) covering respective opposite surfaces of said electrodes (28, 29)
and opposed to each other for feeding in circulation; and
deposit scratching members (38, 39) remote from a position in which the electrostatic
field produced between said electrodes works and contacting outer surfaces of said

endless belts throughout their width, respectively,

   characterized in that
said endless belts (30, 31) are insulative endless
belts (30, 31) so that the charged powders and/or particles fall downward in said electrostatic field, and

   by further comprising

deposit scratching members (38, 39) are mounted, respectively, one (27) of said support frames

being operable to move toward and away from the other (26) support frame.
The apparatus of claim 1, further comprising:

a material-to-be-classified supply mechanism (23) for supplying said powders
and/or particles to a portion (47) over said electrodes (28, 29); and
a recovery container (24) for collecting said powders and/or particles under said
electrodes (28, 29).
The apparatus of claim 2, further comprising:

drive mechanisms (32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37) for feeding said endless belts in circulation in predetermined
directions, respectively.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein said electrodes (28, 29) are of a vertically 
elongated flat plate type.
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein said deposit scratching members (38, 39) are in
contact with portions of said endless belts (30, 31) in which said outer surfaces of said

endless belts face downward.
The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said deposit scratching members (38, 39) are in
pressure contact with said endless belts (30, 31) from below said endless belts.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein said opposite surfaces of said electrodes (28, 29)
are slightly spaced apart from said endless belts (30, 31), respectively.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said endless belts (30, 31) have an insulation
resistance of not less than 100 MΩcm.
