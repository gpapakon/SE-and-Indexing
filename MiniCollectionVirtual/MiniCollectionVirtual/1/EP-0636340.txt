<ABSTRACT>
Vacuum cleaner comprising a suction body having an air inlet (11), an air outlet (21) and a hose fitted with a nozzle connected to the air inlet of the suction body, which body houses a dust chamber (10) communicating with the air inlet (11), and a housing (20) for a fan (23) driven by an electric motor (22), this housing (20) communicating with the dust chamber (10) and air outlet (21), this vacuum cleaner also comprising:   - a first sensor (14), for sensing the floor surface, is [and] a pressure sensor which supplies a signal corresponding to the air pressure measured at a first measurement point (15) in the path of the air drawn in by the vacuum cleaner, which signal has pseudo-periodic oscillations whose maxima ( gamma ) and minima ( epsilon ) correspond in the one case to the outward movements, and in the other to the return movements, of the nozzle over the floor surface during the cleaning operation, this signal having an amplitude difference ( DELTA P), between these maxima and minima, that varies according to the kind of floor surface being cleaned, and in that the computing means (30, 40) determine the kind of floor surface being cleaned on the basis of this difference in amplitude ( DELTA P); - computing means that use the signals supplied by the first sensor in order to output a classification signal indicating the condition of the floor surface during the course of the cleaning operation.
