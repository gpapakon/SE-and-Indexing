effected while the flip-flop circuit (1) remains in the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-volatile
semiconductor memory device having a rewrite data
setting function (i.e. a verify function), and more
particularly to a sense amplifier type circuit used
for write and read operations.Since a non-volatile semiconductor memory device
has an advantage in which data is not lost even if power
is turned off, a demand for such non-volatile semiconductor
memories has recently increased more and more.
Unlike a two-transistor byte-type non-volatile semiconductor
memory device, a flash memory or an electrically
butch-erasable non-volatile semiconductor memory device
may have a memory cell constituted by a single transistor.
As a result, the size of the memory cell can be
decreased, and it is expected to substitute the flash
memory for a large-capacity magnetic disk.In this type of non-volatile semiconductor memory
device, a memory cell array is constituted by arranging
memory cells comprising MOS transistors with floating
gates in a matrix. A threshold value of the MOS
transistor is varied by accumulating a charge in the
floating gate, and data is stored by the threshold
value. At the time of data write or data read, an
electric current is let to flow to the gate insulative
film to control data. Thus, a write time varies
greatly, depending on a change in process or use 
condition. This is a principal difference between the
above non-volatile semiconductor memory device and a
DRAM or SRAM. As a result, a single chip may comprise
cells with a short write time and cells with a long
write time.In order to describe the above problems in detail,
a conventional non-volatile semiconductor memory device
with reference to a NAND type flash memory.FIG. 1 is a circuit diagram showing a cell structure
of the NAND type flash memory. Non-volatile memory
cells M1 to M16, each comprising a MOS transistor having
a floating gate, are connected in series. The memory
cell M1 at one end of the group of the memory cells M1
to M16 is connected to a bit line BL via a selector
transistor Q1, and the memory cell M16 at the other end
thereof is connected to a common source line S via a
selector transistor Q2. Each transistor constituting
each cell is formed on a single well substrate W.
Control gates of memory cells M1 to M16 are connected to
word lines WL1 to WL16, a control electrode of the
selector transistor Q1 is connected to a selector line
SL1, and a control gate of the selector transistor Q2 is
connected to a selector line SL2.Each of the memory cells M1 to M16 has a threshold
value
