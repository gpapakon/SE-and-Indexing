<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a concrete pole such
as an electricity pole, of the kind generally known as for example in
US-A-5 043 003 or EP-A-0 173 446.Concrete poles are widely used for many electric poles
including those for power distribution in urban areas, and
those for power supply for electric trains. In general, a
concrete pole is formed into a hollow elongate structure
made of reinforced concrete by using a cage of reinforcing
bars formed into a desired shape and placing concrete by
centrifugal casting in and outside this cage. The pole may
be cylindrical, for example a right circular cylinder, or
tapered.When an automobile collides with a concrete pole on
the road, the concrete pole first deflects and then resumes
its original vertical posture by elasticity. When the
impact is strong and results in a large deflection,
however, the reinforcing bars in the interior are
plastically deformed with an elongation of only 0.2% and
the concrete pole cannot resume the original posture, but
remains deformed.A concrete pole thus deformed is a traffic hindrance
and can be dangerous.Under such circumstances as described above, there is 
a demand for a concrete pole having an improved elasticity,
which, even after occurrence of such a large deflection as
to cause plastic deformation of reinforcing bars therein,
can resume the original vertical posture thereof by
elasticity, and does not form a traffic hindrance or a
danger for cars and electric trains. A concrete pole
provided with such properties has not as yet been proposed.The present invention aims to provide a concrete pole
having an improved elasticity.According to a first aspect of the present invention
there is provided a concrete pole which comprises
reinforced concrete of elongate shape having reinforcing
bars characterised in that part of the outer circumference
of said concrete pole is reinforced by a reinforcing layer
of a fibre-reinforced composite material which is composed
of reinforcing fibres and a thermosetting resin impregnated
in the reinforcing fibres; said reinforcing layer covers
a depth of at least 30 cm and a height of at least 100 cm
relative to the ground level upon burying of said concrete
pole; the reinforcing fibres of said reinforcing layer are
oriented in the axial direction of said reinforced
concrete; and the total cross-sectional area (SR) and
modulus of elasticity (ER) of the reinforcing fibres of said
reinforcing layer satisfy the following relational formula
relative to the total cross-sectional area (SS) and
