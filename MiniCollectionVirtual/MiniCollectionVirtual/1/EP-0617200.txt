<ABSTRACT>
Piston pump for feeding gas oil to Diesel engines of motor-cars 
in general, comprising: (1) a pump casing provided with a control 

bar (3) provided with a damper (7) fixed at its end (3'); a 
cylinder subdivided into two chambers, an upper (22) and a lower 

(24) one; a piston (4) resting on said damper (7) and comprising 
at least two holes (26) for the transfer of fuel from said upper 

chamber (22) and said lower chamber (24); two fuel inlet (5a) and 
outlet (5b) valves; a pressure spring (6) acting on springs (5a) 

and (5b) and therefore on piston (4); a union (25) for the 
delivery of fuel to the engine; and means (7) for fastening said 

pump casing (1) to the engine (29).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a piston pump for feeding gas oil to 
Diesel engines of motor-cars in general. More particularly, this invention relates to a piston pump 
utilizable at a delivery pressure from 0,5 to 6 bars and capable 
of replacing both the present membrane pumps provided for low and 
middle-powered Diesel engines (up to about 13,000 cm3) and the 
present piston pumps installed on high-powered Diesel engines 
(over 13,000 cm3). EP-A-00277/7 discloses a piston pump for feeding fuel internal combustion engines 
including the features defined in the preamble of claim 1. Current membrane pumps, utilizable for pressures from 0.5 to 1 
bars, while having enjoyed a remarkable success in the past years 
both from the economic and the performance point of views, show 
at present several drawbacks and limits. In fact, they are subject to a rather quick wear and have 
therefore a rather short life, which amounts, on the average, to 
about 2,000 hours of work. A further drawback is due to the fact that the membrane of the 
pump is directly in touch with the engine oil, even though in  
 
some applications it has been tried to utilize a rubber 
protection gasket. Such direct touch with the engine oil may 
actually cause several breakdowns in the pump, with the ensuing 
stanstill of the machine. A typical case is the breaking of the 
membrane due to an excessive increase in the oil pressure in the 
sump. Another drawback is the loss of engine oil from the 
membrane breather, if the pump is provided with a gasket on the 
stem. This drawback involves the pollution of the ground with engine 
oil and fuel. Lastly, the performances of the known pumps are 
less satisfactory at low temperatures (between -30°C and -40°C) 
and said pumps are not particularly suitable for new fuels such 
as Biodiesel and Arctic Diesel which would require special 
membranes, realized with suitable materials or material mixes. The traditional piston pumps, utilizable for pressures up to 
about 6 bars, come from an old project of more than thirty years 
ago, and while being very reliable, they do not satisfy the 
present requirements, especially because of the high fabrication  
 
costs. The object of this invention is to solve all of these drawbacks. 
More particularly, the object of this invention is to provide a 
piston pump for feeding gas oil to Diesel engines, such as to 
allow to correct and overcome the limits of present pumps, 
independently on whether they are membrane or piston pumps. According to this invention, these and

<CLAIMS>
A piston pump for feeding gas oil to Diesel engines of motorcars in 
general, comprising: 


a pump casing (1) fixed to the engine (29) by fastening means (27) 
and comprising a cylinder; 
a piston (4) sliding into said cylinder and subdividing said cylinder 
into two chambers, a first upper chamber (22) and a second lower 

chamber (24); said piston (4) being provided with at least two holes 
(26) for the transfer of the gas oil from said first chamber (22) to said 

second chamber (24); 
a first inlet union (23) for the inlet of the gas oil from a tank; 
a second outlet union (25) for the delivery of the gas oil from the 
second chamber (24) to the engine;
