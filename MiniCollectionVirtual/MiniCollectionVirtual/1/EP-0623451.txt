<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the automatic laying of an endless rubberised textile fabric band (1) onto a tyre building drum (5), the textile fabric band (1) is fed via a guide path (3) to a laying device (4) and subsequently to the tyre building drum (5). Then, the textile fabric band (1) is guided in the laying device (4) by an adjusting means (42), which has a carriage (424) which is driven by a servo motor (425) and can be moved parallel to the axis of the shaft (51) of the tyre building drum (5). A rotary transducer (6) supplies the data on the rotary movement of the shaft (51) of the tyre building drum (5) to a computer (7), which determines the required rotational speed of the servo motor (425) driving the carriage (424) in order that the axial displacement of the carriage (424) proceeds in a fixed dependence on the angular velocity of the tyre building drum (5), so that if there is any change in the angular velocity of the tyre building drum (5) the axial displacement of the carriage (424) is adapted accordingly.

<CLAIMS>
Device for feeding and automatically laying a continuous
rubberised textile fabric band (1) on a tyre construction

drum (5), with an adjusting means (42) having a cradle
(424), which is driven by a servomotor (425) and is movable

parallel to the axis of the shaft (51) of the tyre
construction drum (5), whereby the tyre construction drum

(5) connects to a shaft encoder (6), which passes data
relating to the rotational movement of the shaft (51) of

the tyre construction drum (5) to a computer (7), which
determines the required speed of the servomotor (425)

driving the cradle (424) so that the axial displacement of
the cradle proceeds in fixed dependence upon the angular

velocity of the tyre construction drum (5), characterised
in that on the cradle (424) a support (44) is provided for

a guide unit (444) with a double-action compressed air
cylinder, whereby a support plate (46) is attached to a

connection flange (45) of the guide unit, onto said support

plate a support (462) for the cover roller (463) of a
roller guidance system (464) and three double-action

compressed air cylinders (461) are mounted with relative
rotation locking means, whereby a contact pressure plate

(47) is fastened to the connection plate of the first
compressed air cylinder (461), while on the connection

plate of the second compressed air cylinder (461) a needle
cushion (48) with fixedly mounted cutting blade (481) is

fastened and on the connection plate of the third
compressed air cylinder (461) a foam-coated pressure roller

(49) is fastened.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that at least
three roller guidance systems (434, 442, 464) are provided.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
support for the guide unit is an aluminium plate (44).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the needle cushion (48) and the contact pressure plate

(47) are coupled to one another mechanically in such a way
that when the needle cushion (48) moves downwards, the

contact pressure plate (47) is taken along with it, and
when the contact pressure plate (47) is moved upwards, the

needle cushion (48) with the cutting blade (481) is taken
along with it, and that the counter-piece of the needles of

the needle cushion (48) and the cutting blade (481) are
firmly integrated into the aluminium plate (44).
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in
that between the first roller guidance system (434)

arranged behind the drive pulley (432) and the second
roller guidance system (442), two further roller guidance

systems (436, 441) with perpendicular rollers are arranged,
as a result of which the textile fabric band (1) passing

through may be guided laterally to the cradle (424) in a
position rotated 90Â° relative to the remaining position.
