<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of producing a connection, especially a threaded connection, by means of a regulatable connecting device, in which at least two current measured values representing the connecting progress are determined during the connecting. A regulation is to be carried out during the connecting which enables a presettable desired value to be attained as accurately as possible. To this end, provision is made for the measured values to be evaluated in the manner of fuzzy logic and a correcting variable for the connecting device to be determined from this.

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing a joint, in particular a 
screw connection, by means of a controllable joining 

device, at least two current measured values representing 
the progress of the joining being determined during the 

joining, characterized in that the measured values are 
evaluated in the manner of fuzzy logic and, from this, an 

actuating variable for the joining device is determined. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the measured values are deter
mined during the entire 
joining process until a desired value of at least one of 

the measured values is reached. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the measured values are determined 

until a provisional joining state is reached and at this 
time an actuating variable for the joining device is 

determined. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the measured values are registered 

cyclically. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the torque and the angle of 

rotation are registered as measured values. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the change in the torque over the 

change in the angle of rotation and hence a stiffness is 
registered. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the change in the angle of rotation 

over the change in time and hence a rotational speed is  
 

registered. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the stiffness and the rotational 

speed are logically combined with one another as input 
variables in the manner of fuzzy logic. 
Method according to Claim 6 or 8, characterized 
in that a distinction is drawn between the cases "low 

stiffness", "normal stiffness" and "high stiffness". 
Method according to Claim 7 or 8, characterized 
in that a distinction is drawn between the cases "low 

rotational speed", "normal rotational speed" and "high 
rotational speed". 
Method according to one of Claims 8-10, characterized 
in that, from the instantaneous values of the 

stiffness and of the rotational speed, the controller 
factors influencing the actuating variable are determined 

as output variable of the fuzzy logic and are logically 
combined with one another.
