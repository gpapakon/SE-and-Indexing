<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related to EP-A-06 37 314
for "Protecting Groups Useful In Oligonucleotide
Synthesis" by Parameswara Meda Reddy and Naeem Botros
Hanna, which is filed simultaneously herewith.The present invention relates generally to the
synthesis of oligonucleotides and more particularly to
methods and reagents for cleaving oligonucleotides from
solid supports, and removing protecting groups from
oligonucleotides.Deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA") and ribonucleic
acid ("RNA") are long, threadlike macromolecules, DNA
comprising a chain of deoxyribonucleotides, and RNA
comprising a chain of ribonucleotides. A nucleotide
consists of a nucleoside and one or more phosphate
groups; a nucleoside consists of a nitrogenous base
linked to a pentose sugar. Typically, the phosphate
group is attached to the fifth-carbon ("C-5") hydroxyl
group ("OH") of the pentose sugar; however, it can also 
be attached to the third-carbon hydroxyl group ("C-3
OH"). In a molecule of DNA, the pentose sugar is
deoxyribose, while in a molecule of RNA, the pentose
sugar is ribose. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are
adenine ("A"), cytosine ("C"), guanine ("G"), and thymine
("T"). These bases are the same for RNA, except that
uracil ("U") replaces thymine. Accordingly, the major
nucleosides of DNA, collectively referred to as
"deoxynucleosides" are as follows: deoxyadenosine ("dA");
deoxycytidine ("dC"); deoxyguanosine ("dG"); and
thymidine ("T"). The corresponding ribonucleosides are
designated as "A"; "C"; "G"; and "U". (By convention,
and because there is no corresponding thymidine
ribonucleoside, deoxythymidine is typically designated as
"T"; for consistency purposes, however, thymidine will be
designated as "dT" throughout this disclosure).The sequence of the nitrogenous bases of the
DNA or RNA molecule encodes the genetic information
contained in the molecule. The sugar and phosphate
groups of a DNA or RNA molecule perform a structural
role, forming the backbone of the molecule.
Specifically, the sugar moiety of each nucleotide is
linked to the sugar moiety of the adjacent nucleotide
such that the 3'-hydroxyl of the pentose sugar of one
nucleotide is linked to the 5'-hydroxyl of the pentose
sugar of the adjacent nucleotide. The linkage between
the two pentose sugars is typically via a phosphodiester
bond. Based upon this linkage protocol, one end
("terminus") of the nucleotide chain has a 5'-terminus
(e.g. hydroxyl, triphosphate, etc.), and the other end
has a 3'-hydroxyl group. By convention, the base
sequence of a nucleotide
