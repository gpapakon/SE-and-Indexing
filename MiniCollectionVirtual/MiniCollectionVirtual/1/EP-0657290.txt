<ABSTRACT>
A recovery method for an ink jet recording 
apparatus comprising recording means for recording 

by discharging the ink with bubbles formed by the 
thermal energy applied to a heat acting area in an 

ink holding portion, and energy supply means for 
forming said thermal energy on said recording means, 

including a compulsory recovery mode in which more 
than 10Â³ predischarges are accomplished by supplying 

the energy exceeding 1.48 times the minimum energy 
Eo necessary for producing said bubbles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording apparatus
according to claim 7 and to a method for driving the same
according to claim 1.Such an ink jet
recording apparatus is designed to be mountable on or connectable to
a copying machine, a printer, a communication
equipment, or an information equipment and a recovery
method of a recording head applicable thereto.
Furthermore, the present invention is effective to a
compulsory recovery mechanism (including either of
electrical or mechanical one) in a device having heat
generating elements for forming bubbles in the ink by
generating the thermal energy and a driving circuit
for driving them with an electrical pulse signal.As fundamental inventions for forming bubbles
with the thermal energy, there are those as driving a
heat generating resistor with an electrical pulse
signal, or using the optical energy, and in addition,
having elements for converting the optical energy to
the heat, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,740,796
or West German Offenlegungschrift No. 2,843,064.In the field of an ink jet recording, the
recovery process called a predischarge is performed
as a process for discharging the ink from an outlet 
in other than recording. As the invention for
accomplishing this predischarge with an appropriate
exhaust of ink including the in-recording or waiting,
there is known U.K. Patent No. 2,169,855. In this
official gazette, the recovery performed during usual
recording as the predischarge is specifically
described and stated expressly as the invention.On the other hand, for the recovery of a
recording head in the extreme state, the recovery
using a pump ordinarily called as the suction
recovery has been put to practical use, but there is
a disadvantage in accomplishing a smaller, lighter or
less expensive apparatus because of its complex
construction. Also, in U.S. Patent No. 4,977,459
disclosing that a proper recovery processing is
executed in accordance with the state of a recording
head, the final compulsory recovery adopts the
suction recovery, but not the predischarge.Also, a conventional predischarge is
performed in an ordinary discharge condition for
recording or its similar condition because it is
relatively frequently operated. This is to extend
the life of heat generating elements for the
recording head. The predischarged ink is discharged
toward an ink absorbing member, but in addition,
specific paper, recording sheet, foaming material,
and a cap for recording head are known as the ink 
receiving member.However, particularly in
