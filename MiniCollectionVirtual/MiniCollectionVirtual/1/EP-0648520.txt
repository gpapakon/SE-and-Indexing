<ABSTRACT>
Crystallization method and crystallization apparatus each use 
vertical plates for crystallization thereon. Both surfaces of the plate 

are used for different two liquids to flow down as films. Specifically, 
on one vertical surface, a feed liquid mixture containing 

crystallizable components therein flows down as a film, and on an 
opposite vertical surface, a cooling medium flows down as a film. 

Accordingly, the crystallizable component contained in the feed 
liquid mixture is cooled and crystallized to form crystal layers on 

the one vertical surface of the plate. The formed crystal layers are 
melted by a heating medium which flows down on the opposite 

vertical surface, and are collected as a melt. A pair of the plates may 
be used to form a unit to purify the liquid mixture on a large scale. 

A number of the units may be used to form a block which is suitable 
for a larger-scale crystallization processing. Further, a number of 

the blocks may be used to purify the liquid mixtures on a further 
larger-scale processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus
for obtaining high-purity products by crystallization from liquid
mixtures containing crystallizable components, and further relates
to the foregoing method and apparatus which are particularly
suitable for large-scale purification processes. More specifically, the
present invention is suitable for large-scale and multi-stage
purification of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.It is known, for example, that commercially produced acrylic
acid usually contains such impurity components as acetic acid and
propionic acid and the concentrations of these impurities are about
0.1% in total. Recently, usage of acrylic acid has been expanded,
and in some cases, very high-purity acrylic acids are required. For
example, the impurity concentrations in the order of some tens to
hundreds of ppm are required for paper diapers.In general, impurities are removed by distillation. However, it
is very difficult to remove such impurities as acetic acid and
propionic acid by distillation since these impurity components have
boiling points close to that of acrylic acid. Under such
circumstances, it has been proposed to remove these impurities by
crystallization.Two typical crystallization methods are available; one being 
that seed crystals are put into a liquid mixture containing a
crystallizable component so as to nucleate and grow crystals in a
suspended state in the liquid, and the other being crystals are
formed and grown on cooled surfaces.A mixing vessel type crystallizer is used for the former
method. In this type of crystallizer, however, heat exchange area
tends to be insufficient to produce a large quantity of crystals from
liquid mixtures. Further, in case of adhesive crystals, such as,
acrylic acid, cooling coils can not be used although it is necessary to
scrape the crystals off the cooled surfaces. Therefore, the heat
exchange area is definitely insufficient. Moreover, since solid-liquid
separation is unavoidable, the structure and operations of this type
of crystallizer are complicated to perform multi-stage crystallization.The latter method is described in, such documents as,
"Handbook of Industrial Crystallization, Butterworth-Heinemann,
1993" edited by A. S. Myerson and "Introduction to Easy Practical
Crystallization Process (KEMIKARU ENJINIARINGU), pages 76-83"
September, 1992 by Masakuni MATSUOKA. According to these
documents, the latter method is advantageous in view of easy
handling and of high crystallization rate. On the other hand,
