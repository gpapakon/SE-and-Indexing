<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filters for use in video
applications, and particularly to a filter effective to
reduce noise contained in digital video signals.It is known that, in general, a reduction of the noise
contained in signals can be obtained through filters of the
low-pass type having a predetermined cutoff frequency.
However, the use of such filters involves in most cases a
reduction of a signal portion which may contain useful
information.With video signals, for example, the use of low-pass
filters involves an attenuation of the high-frequency
components which contain useful information about the image
outline.To alleviate this drawback, adaptive filters have been
employed which adapt their frequency response to the
characteristics of the signals that appear at their inputs.Such filters require, however, considerable computation
work for their implementation due to their highly
complicated circuitry. In video signal processing, noise
reduction has been achieved using, as well as linear
filters of the bi-dimensional low-pass type formed by
conventional synthesis methods -- which filters often
result in loss of useful information -- non linear filters
including a filter known in literature as median filter.For video signals, filters have also been used which
operate in a logic mode based on fuzzy rules.Fuzzy methods for use in filtering techniques directed to
reduce the noise contained in video signals are described,
for example, in the following articles: F. Russo and G. 
Ramponi, "Fuzzy Operators for Sharpening of Noisy Images",
Electronics Letters, Vol. 28, No. 18, August 1992; F. Russo
and G. Ramponi. "Working on Image Data Using Fuzzy Rules",
Signal Processing IV Theories and Applications, Proceedings
of EUSIPCO-92, Brussels, Belgium, August 1992; and C.W. Tao
and W.E. Thompson, "A Fuzzy If-Then Approach to Edge
Detection", Proceedings of Second IEEE Conference on Fuzzy
System, San Francisco, California, March/April 1993.
Filters operating on fuzzy logic are, however, complex
architectures at structural level and costly to
manufacture.The underlying technical problem of this invention is to
provide a filter for reducing the noise contained in video
signals which, additionally to having a structurally simple
architecture which is relatively inexpensive to make, can
filter out just the signal portion that contains noise and
no useful information.The above technical problem is solved by a filter acting on
digital image signals for apparatus of the video type as
defined in the characterizing parts
