<ABSTRACT>
Reaction-curable resin compositions based on unsaturated polyester resins, vinyl ester resins or acrylic resins are generally two-component systems, where one component contains the preaccelerated reaction-curable resin and the other component contains the curing agent. In order to ensure homogeneous curing of the components and to reduce the consumption of curing agent, based on the total amount of resin, an anchoring cartridge having two chambers is proposed, where the first chamber contains a curing agent component comprising an unaccelerated resin which cures by means of free radicals in which a certain amount of curing agent is dissolved, and the other chamber contains a resin which has been mixed with accelerator.

<CLAIMS>
Anchoring cartridge having at least two chambers for 
fastening a fastening element in a drilled hole,
 
characterised in that one chamber contains a hardener 

component that comprises an unaccelerated radical-curing 
resin in which a specific amount of hardener is dissolved 

and the other chamber contains a resin that is mixed with 
an accelerator. 
Anchoring cartridge according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the proportion of hardener 

dissolved in the unaccelerated resin is from 1.0 % to 
10 %, based on the total resin content, the hardener 

containing up to 50 % by weight of peroxide. 
Anchoring cartridge according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that peroxides from the groups of the 

ketone peroxides, alkyl peroxides or diacyl peroxides, 
especially dibenzoyl peroxides, are used as the hardener 

component. 
Anchoring cartridge according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that, above 50Â°C, the peroxide contained 

in the hardener component forms thermally polymerisation-inducing 
radicals.
