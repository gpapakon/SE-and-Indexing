<ABSTRACT>
An electromagnetically operable valve includes a slidable valve member 
(26) which is movable into engagement with a seating (23) by energising 

an electromagnetic device (28). A valve element (29) forms part of the 
valve and is in the form of a sleeve which is slidable about a part (30) of 

the valve member. The sleeve is spring biased into engagement with an 
abutment (32) on said part and the sleeve controls flow between a pair 

of ports which are formed in the wall of the bore in which the sleeve is 
mounted. When the valve member is moved into engagement with the 

seating the sleeve is also moved and continues its movement after the 
valve member has engaged the seating in order to open or close 

communication between said ports.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electromagnetically operable valves including a
valve member which is movable between first and second settings and
an electromagnetic device having an output member which is coupled to
the valve member and which when supplied with electric current moves
the valve member from the first setting to the second setting, the valve
including biasing means operable to return the valve member to the first
setting when the supply of electric current is discontinued.Such valves are well known in the art and can be used to control for
example, the amount of fuel which is supplied to a combustion space of
a compression ignition engine. Difficulties arise when the amount of
fuel which needs to be supplied to the engine is reduced and it is
possible that the amount of fuel which is supplied to the engine during
the minimum cycle time of the valve is greater than is required. By
minimum cycle time is meant the minimum time required for the valve
member to move from the first to the second setting and back to the first
setting. In such situations it is known in multi-cylinder engines to stop
the flow of fuel to one or more of the engine combustion spaces so that
the amount of fuel which is supplied to the remaining combustion spaces
can be increased so that the valve or valves can operate for a period
which is longer than the minimum cycle time.A valve is described in DE-C-3838147 which includes a valve element
slidable upon a valve member under its inertia between first and second 
positions to permit a pilot injection of fuel to a cylinder of an engine
followed by a separate main injection.The object of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetically
operable valve in an improved form.According to the present invention there is provided an electromagnetically
operable valve including a valve member movable between
first and second settings by an electromagnetic device having an output
member which is coupled to the valve member, the electromagnetic
device when supplied with electric current, moving the valve member
from its first setting to its second setting against the action of biasing
means which returns the valve member to its first setting when the flow
of electric current is discontinued, a valve element movable between first
and second positions, the valve element moving under its inertia from its
first position to its second position a predetermined time after and in
response to the movement of the valve member to its second setting, the
valve element returning towards

An electromagnetically operable valve including a valve
member (26) movable between first and second settings by an

electromagnetic device (28) having an output member (27) which is
coupled to the valve member (26), the electromagnetic device when

supplied with electric current, moving the valve member from its first
setting to its second setting against the action of biasing means (43)

which returns the valve member to its first setting when the flow of
electric current is discontinued, a valve element (29) movable between

first and second positions, the valve element (29) moving under its inertia
from its first position to its second position a predetermined time after

and in response to the movement of the valve member (26) to its second
setting, the valve element (29) returning towards its first position after a

second predetermined time, the valve element being in the form of a

sleeve (29), a spring (31) being provided to
bias the sleeve towards an abutment (32), and characterised in that the valve element is slidable within a bore (22), the

abutment (32) is provided on a stem (30) of the valve member (26), the
sleeve (29) being loosely located about the stem (30).
A valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that the valve
member (26) is shaped for engagement with a seating (23), the valve

member being in its second setting when in engagement with the
seating.
A valve according to Claim 2, characterised in that said sleeve
(29) is provided with a peripheral groove which is in constant

communication with a first port (33) formed in the wall of the bore (22)
in which the sleeve is mounted, and a second port formed in the wall of 

the bore for communication with said groove depending upon whether
the sleeve is in its first or second setting.
A valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that said valve
member (26) and said valve element (29) control first and second flow

paths respectively through the valve.
A valve according to Claim 4, characterised in that said flow
paths are closed when the valve member (26) is in its second setting and

the valve element (29) is in its second position said flow paths being
connected in parallel between the outlet (16) of a high pressure fuel

pump (13, 14) and a drain.
A valve according to Claim 4, characterised in that said first
flow path is closed when the valve member (26) is in its second setting

and the second flow path is open when the valve element (29) is in its
second position, said first flow path being connected between the inlet of

a fuel injection nozzle (41) and a drain and the second flow path being
connected between the inlet of the nozzle (41) and an accumulator (40)

in which fuel is stored under pressure.
