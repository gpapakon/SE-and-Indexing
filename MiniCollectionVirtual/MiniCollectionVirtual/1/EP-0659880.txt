<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the use of
medium components in a serum-free medium or a protein-free
medium.As a life science has developed, there has been an
increased need to culture animal cells in vitro. Cells
of a number of animal species produce useful substances
which cannot be obtained from other materials, and it is
important to be able to culture these cells in vitro.
Furthermore, animal cells are important as host cells in
transforming target cells with a vector, wherein a gene
coding for a useful protein has been inserted. Although
cells of microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeast, are
also used as a host cell, some proteins require the use
of animal cells. In many cases this is due to
limitations with respect to the addition of sugar chains
or expression-regulatory regions such as a promoter.For example, in order to express the immunoglobulin
gene which 
has been inserted in a vector, myeloma cells are often used as a
host cell. Furthermore, fusion cells which will be the sources of
supply of monoclonal antibodies, various lymphokines and the like
are derived from animal cells.In the culturing of animal cells, a synthetic medium is used
which contains nutrients, such as carbohydrates, lipids, amino
acids, vitamins, peptides, proteins and inorganic ions, as well as
growth promoting factors, such as hormones and nucleosides. Known
synthetic media include MEM (Science, 130, 432; 1959) used for
culturing animal cells in general and RPMI1640 medium (J.A.M.A.,
199, 519; 1967) used for culturing lymphocytes. Usually, these
synthetic media alone are not sufficient to maintain the growth of
cells, and appropriate growth factors are added thereto according to
the properties of the cells to be cultivated.Generally, biological materials, such as various sera, yeast
extract and the hydrolysate of lactoalbumin, are added to a
synthetic medium. Among all, sera are extremely important
additives, exhibiting growth support activity on a wide range of
animal cells. They are added to the medium regardless of the kind
of cells to be cultured. At present, animal sera derived from
different animals including human, equine, bovine, simian and avian
are utilized in cell cultivation. Furthermore, with respect to the
serum derived from bovine, for example, it is known that the cell
growth promoting effect decreases in the following order: fetal calf
serum (hereinafter referred to as "FCS") > new born calf serum
(within 1 week from birth) > calf serum (within 6 months from birth)
> bovine serum.However,
