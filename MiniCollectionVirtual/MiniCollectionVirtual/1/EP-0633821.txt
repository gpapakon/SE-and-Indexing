<ABSTRACT>
This publication discloses an assembly suited for feeding a powderized filler material in plasma welding. The invention is based on feeding the filler material flow first along a first channel (6), which is next divided into two separate channels (7) that are branched aside from said first channel (6). The forked branches (7) can further be divided into a plurality of branches (8, 9), and according to an advantageous embodiment, the manifold of feed channels exits into a feed nozzle (5, 11, 12, 13) of shielding gas and powderized filler material, said nozzle being provided with a plurality of grooves (11) along which the gas and powderized filler material enter the welding plasma of the torch and the gas flow becomes laminarized. The shielding gas and the filler material can be fed along a single manifold of channels and the tip of the torch can be made extremely small in size.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a plasma welding
torch assembly for feeding, in addition to other materials,
a powderized filler material in a welding torch
according to the preamble of claim 1.
Use of powderized filler material in mechanized welding
is well known in the art. Powderized filler material is
conventionally added during the welding of wide-gap
downhand welds in horizontal position as well as in
plasma spray coating. In the welding of joints the added
powderized filler is similar to the parent materials to be
joined, while in plasma spray coating the powderized
filler materials can be varied widely according to the
coating desired. A powderized filler material is particularly
advantageously employed in plasma and laser
welding.In prior-art embodiments the dosing of the powderized
filler material is typically arranged so that a stripe of
the powderized filler material is applied via a nozzle orifice
at the bottom of powderized material container onto
a moving support such as a roller or band. The dosed
powderized material is transferred from the support surface
by gravity or compressed gas into a transport system
that conveys the powderized filler material to the
weld poof. The transport system conventionally is a
mere pipe opening in the vicinity of the plasma arc so
that the powderized filler material fed via the pipe is
directed into the plasma. Occasionally the powderized
material tends to dog the feed line, whereby a pulsating
feed of the powderized material stream results. A constant
feed rate of the powderized material stream has
been attempted by means of a small-diameter feed line
combined with high flow speed.In a plasma torch the main arc used for welding is
excited between the center electrode of the torch and
the work piece. The nozzle part of the torch comprises
two coaxially situated chambers. The inner chamber
houses a centered tungsten electrode and the chamber
is provided with an orifice aligned at the electrode tip.
The orifice gas to be ionized into a plasma is fed into
this chamber. The inner chamber is coaxially enclosed
by a second chamber having an annular exit slot surrounding
the nozzle of the inner chamber. This outer
chamber is fed with a shielding gas whose exit flow protects
the main arc. Obviously, the feed of the powderized
filler material into the arc of the plasma torch is
difficult. The plasma arc in itself causes a relatively
strong blast which repels the powderized material, and
moreover, the arc is surrounded by a shielding gas
envelope through which

materials, a powderized filler material in a welding torch, said

torch comprising

a body part (1)
elements adapted to the interior of the body part, suited to
establish a welding flame,
a nozzle piece (3) enclosing the welding flame at the tip
section of the body part (1) of the torch,
a feed channel system for conveying the filler material to the
tip section of the torch comprising


at least one inlet channel (6),
an annular space or chamber (10,22)
and nozzle elements (5, 11, 12, 13, 25),

capable of directing the filler material flow
from the at least one inlet channel (6) into the annular space

or chamber (10, 22), after that into the nozzle elements (5,
11, 12, 13, 25) and then into the wel
ding flame at the tip
section of the nozzle piece (3),
characterized in that
the inlet channel(6) is divided into at least two first branches
(7), forked from the end of the inlet channel (6), in order to

divide the filler material flow and divert its flow direction and
thereafter guide the flow to said annular space or chamber

(10, 22) and after that to said nozzle elements (5, 11, 12, 13,
25).
An assembly as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
by
 at least two second branches (8, 9) forked from
the end of each of said first branches (7), suited to

diverting the filler material flow in a second stage
prior to guiding the flow to said nozzle elements (5,

11, 12, 13).
An assembly as defined in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the number of said inlet channels (6) is
two and said channels are located symmetrically on

both sides of the body part (1) of the torch.
An assembly as defined in any foregoing claim,

characterized by
 ridges (11, 12) formed to the tip section
of the body part (1) of the torch, suited to act as a

flow-laminarizing section in the nozzle elements (5,
11, 12, 13).
An assembly as defined in any foregoing claim,

characterized in that
 at least the branching section
(7, 8, 9) of the feed channel system is formed on

the outer surface of the body part (1) of the torch
and said branching section is then delineated into

ducting channels with the help of a shell (4, 5)
enclosing said body part (1).
An assembly as defined in claim 5, 
characterized 
in that
 said shell (4, 5) is dividable into two parts
and the shell part (5) enclosing said nozzle elements

(11, 12, 13) is detachable.
An assembly as defined in any foregoing claim, 
characterized
by
 at least one hole (17) made in the wall of said
annular space or chamber (10), said hole being covered with a

screen for separating the shielding gas from the
filler material stream.
