<ABSTRACT>
The barrier or buffer layer with first conductivity (15), has a greater thickness than is electrically essential. It is introduced in this form, by diffusion into the single-crystal homogeneous wafer in the base zone (13), before introducing other structures on the wafer top. Once they have been formed, the excess is ground and/or polished off.

Method for the production of a Punch-Through-power
semiconductor component with at least one pn- transition

blocking a high voltage starting from a single-crystal
semiconductor wafer with a first conductivity in low

doping, wherein the power semiconductor component has a
base zone (13) of the first conductivity and low doping,

a stop layer (15) of the first conductivity with high
doping, an emitter of a second conductivity on the under

side of the power semiconductor component and further
diffusion regions (4, 5) of different conductivity on

the upper side of the power semiconductor element, with
the following one after another following process steps:


simultaneous diffusion of the stop layer (15) on
the wafer under side and a further layer (14) of

the first conductivity on the wafer upper side, in
the single-crystal semiconductor wafer;
complete removal of the further layer (14) from the
wafer upper side;
formation of all of the above named further
diffusion regions (4, 5) on the wafer upper side

(4, 5) for the formation of the functionality of
the power semiconductor element;
reducing the layer thickness of the stop layer (15)
on the wafer under side;
formation of the emitter (12) on the wafer under
side.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
, the
stop layer (15) and the further layer (14) are

simultaneously diffused ca. 150 µm deep.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
, the
further layer (14) is removed by means of lapping and/or

polishing.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
,
after the removal of the further layer and before the

reducing of the layer thickness of the stop layer,
further process steps for the formation of an oxide

layer (6) and of a polysilicon layer (7) are carried
out.
Method according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
, the
reduction of the layer thickness of the stop layer (15)

is carried out to ca. 25 µm.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

emitter (12) is produced by means of implantation and

low temperature-annealing or low temperature- epitaxy.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
, the
emitter (12) is produced by means of introducing of

dopants and activation of the dopants by RTP/RTA
processes.
