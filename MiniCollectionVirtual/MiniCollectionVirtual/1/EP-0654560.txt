<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus is described 
herein for cleaning the surface of a 

backing roll in a coater or a calender 
roll. The roll (1) is cleaned by spraying 

water on it and then scraping the water 
away from the surface of the roll (1) by 

means of a doctor blade (4). According to 
the invention, splashing of the water 

accumulating in front of the doctor blade 
(4) is prevented by means of a rubber 

sheet (5) extending down close to the tip 
of the blade (4), or alternatively, using 

a guide blade mounted in front of the 
doctor blade (4). The rubber sheet (5) 

preceding the doctor blade (4) isolates 
the water pond formed in front of the 

doctor blade from the surface of the roll 
(1), whereby the rotational movement of 

the roll (1) cannot induce turbulence and 
splashes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to an apparatus in 
accordance with the preamble of claim 1 for cleaning a 
calender roll, coater backing roll or similar rolls. Cleaning of coater backing rolls and calender rolls, 
particularly those of soft calenders has been necessary as 
long as such equipment has been in use. Dirt accumulates on 
the backing rolls as the coating mix penetrates the paper 
web during coating via the web pores and adheres onto the 
roll surface. The roll may also gather dirt as the coating 
mix finds access via holes in the base paper. Rolls of soft 
calenders accumulate adhering matter from dirt and coat 
dust carried over by the moving web and from areas of thick 
coats that have remained moist thus permitting their 
adherence on the roll surface. The penetration depth of the 
coating mix, and thus, its filtration through the web, is 
determined by the paper web porosity and thickness as well 
as the process conditions such as the application/doctor 
blade pressure and coating mix properties. With the modern 
trends of using a thin base web and a high coat weight, the 
coating mix is filtered in greater amounts through the base 
web thus resulting in heavier dirt accumulation on the 
rolls than encountered before. A coat clump adhered to the 
roll becomes firmly fixed to the roll through drying and 
then causes marking on the paper sheet. Paper quality 
degradation through marking obviously increases as the 
accumulation of dirt on the roll progresses. Cleaning the rolls has in the prior art been performed by 
means of manual washing and doctoring with a doctor blade. 
Manual washing with a wetted sponge is clumsy and time-consuming 
and requires heavy manual labor. Due to high web 
speeds and greater tendency to dirt accumulation, the need 
for cleaning the rolls is frequent, since the rolls become 
dirty so rapidly. As the manual cleaning of the rolls is  
 
slow and accumulation of dirt is fast, manpower must be 
allocated on an almost continuous basis for the cleaning 
job. The work must be done carefully, because no water 
drippage from a sponge onto the running web is allowed and 
the operation must be performed whilst the equipment is 
running. As modern equipment are designed for high web 
speeds and wide webs, manual cleaning of long rolls is 
extremely awkward and dangerous. Manual washing of rolls can be replaced by the use of 
doctor blades. Such an arrangement accomplishes dirt 
removal from roll surface with the help of a doctor blade.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning the surface of a roll (1) 
such as a backing roll of a coater or a calender roll, 

comprising 

a blade holder (3), 
attached to-the blade holder (3), a doctor blade (4) 
which is adjustable against the surface of the roll 

(1) to be cleaned, and 
adapted in front of the doctor blade (4) relative to 
the rotational direction of the roll (1), water 

spray means (2) suited for feeding washing water 
onto the surface of the roll (1), 
characterized
 by 

a means (5, 16) extending in front of the doctor blade (4) to the corner between the 
doctor blade (4) and the roll (1) close to the nip 

between the roll (1) and the doctor blade (4), said 
means forming an edge (10) extending over the entire length 

of the doctor blade (4), said edge performing the flow 
control of the water hitting the doctor blade (4) so 

as to guide water backflow away from the surface of 
the roll (1), thus effectively preventing the backflow 

of the washing water onto the surface of the roll (1). 
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the means extending in front of the doctor blade (4) to the corner 
between the doctor blade (4) and the roll (1) is a rubber 

sheet (5) extending parallelly to the surface of the roll 
(1) close to the doctor blade (4). 
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the means extending in front of the doctor blade (4) to the corner 
between the doctor blade (4) and the roll (1) is a guide 

blade (16) adjusted to guide the water hitting the doctor  
 

blade (4) to flow into the slit between the doctor blade 
(4) and the guide blade (16). 
An apparatus as defined in claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the means (5, 16) extending in front of the doctor blade (4) to the corner between the doctor blade (4) and the roll (1) comprises both a rubber sheet (5) and a guide 
blade (16) adapted to extend to the corner between the doctor 

blade (4) and the roll (1).  
 
An apparatus as defined in any foregoing claim 1 - 4, 

characterized
 by holes (13) in the doctor 
blade (4) that permit the passage of water to the rear of 

the doctor blade (4) and by a water collection pool (12) 
adapted to the rear of the doctor blade (4) for collecting 

the water taken to the rear of the doctor blade (4). 
An apparatus as defined in claim 5, 
characterized
 by an air hose (14) adapted to the sealing 
line between the doctor blade (4) and the water collection 

pool (12), said air hose being suited for the load control 
of the doctor blade (4) by means of adjusting the pressure 

in the hose (14). 
An apparatus as defined in claim 2, 
characterized
 in that the rubber sheet (5) extends over 
the water spray pipe (2) to the front side of the pipe (2) 

and downward close to the surface of the roll (1), whereby 
the rubber sheet (5) can prevent the entry of air to the 

washing zone. 
An apparatus as defined in claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the guide blade (16) is parallel to 
the doctor blade (4). 
An apparatus as defined in claim 2 or 7, 
characterized
 in that the maximum distance of the edge 
(10) of the rubber sheet (5) from the doctor blade (4) is 

smaller than 15 mm.  
 
An apparatus as defined in claim 8, 
characterized
 
in that the gap between the guide blade (16) 

and the doctor blade (4) is approx. 2 - 3 mm wide and the 
distance of the edge of the guide blade (16) from the roll 

(1) is approx. 2 - 5 mm.
