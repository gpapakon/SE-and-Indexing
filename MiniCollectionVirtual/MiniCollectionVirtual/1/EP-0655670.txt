<ABSTRACT>
An integrated circuit in which closer matching or tracking of 
critical components, both active and passive, is achieved by 

time domain multiplexing of these critical components. Time 
domain multiplexing means that each of the components to be 

matched is alternately and sequentially, electronically 
switched between selected positions in the circuit. This is 

accomplished by continuous electronic movement or rotation of 
the critical components into or out of selected circuit 

positions to average in the circuit output any inherent errors 
due to variations resulting from electrical and physical 

characteristics appearing in the components. This arrangement 
is particularly useful in compensating for variations induced 

by the process used to create the components. 
This time domain multiplexing is especially useful in analog 
circuits employing complementary metal on silicon (CMOS) 

transistors, both field effect and bipolar in which component 
tracking is required for quality operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to integrated circuits and 
more particularly to an integrated circuit in which matching of 
critical components can be more closely achieved by time domain 
multiplexing of these critical components. This time domain 
multiplexing is realized by continuous electronic rotation of 
the critical components into and out of selected circuit 
positions to average out in the circuit output any inherent 
errors due to variations resulting from electrical and physical 
characteristics appearing in the components. This arrangement 
is particularly useful in compensating for variations induced 
by the process used to create the components. This 
multiplexing thereby enhances matching between the critical 
components. As integrated circuits, become faster and denser they become 
more sensitive to process variations. This is especially true 
in analog circuits employing complementary metal on silicon 
(CMOS) transistors, both field effect and bipolar. In such a 
case these circuits require component tracking for quality 
operation. As used herein component tracking means the 
matching of selected electrical characteristics of both active 
and passive devices in the circuit. For superior results, in 
integrated analog circuits, it is necessary the transistors 
track one another more closely than the manufacturing processes 
used to create them can provide. Techniques for improving component tracking include physical 
abrasion of resistive deposits on the surface of the integrated 
circuit or by counter doping of selected regions as well as 
improved process controlling the making of these circuits. 
Most of these efforts have been found to be so expensive or 
time consuming or difficult as to be impracticable or cost 
prohibitive for use in manufacturing.  Accordingly it is desired that an inexpensive but highly 
accurate way of achieving such tracking of both active 
(e.g.,transistors) or passive (e.g., resistors) devices in 
integrated circuits be found. The present invention achieves improved component tracking by 
time domain multiplexing, i.e., the process whereby each 
component, of the components to be matched, is alternately and 
sequentially, electronically switched or rotated between 
selected positions in the circuit. With such switching, each 
component first appears in one position in the circuit and is 
then electronically moved in a selected time sequence out of 
that position into a different position in the circuit. The 
continuous electronic rotation or movement of
