<ABSTRACT>
A photographic film cassette (1) is provided with a 
radial bar coded disk (45) having first and second arcuate 

segments (DS,QZ) of differing radial lengths to form a gap (70) 
between the disk (45) and a circumferential lip (68) of the 

cassette housing. By suitable positioning of the disk (45) 
when the film has been fully or partially exposed, the 

gap (70) is aligned with a double exposure prevention hook (52) in 
a camera causing the hook (52) to engage the housing lip (68) 

during attempted insertion of the cassette (1) into the 
camera to thereby prevent complete insertion of the 

cassette (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of
photography, and in particular to bar-coded film spools.
More specifically, the invention relates to a film spool
having a bar code symbol and provision for double
exposure prevention.Various bar code symbols are widely used to label
items for product identification or other purposes.
Generally speaking, a bar code symbol consists of a
sequence of light and dark regions referred to as
elements or bars. These elements are typically
rectangular in shape and often have a variety of possible
widths. An arrangement of elements represents a
character and is determined according to a set of rules
and definitions typically referred to as a "code". A
variety of codes such as the Universal Product Code (UPC)
and Code 39 exist and provide a degree of conformity.More specifically, codes define a set of characters
wherein each character is depicted and defined by a
unique arrangement of elements. To encode a desired
message having a number of characters, a collection of
arrangements of elements are concatenated to form a bar
code symbol. Each character of the message is
represented by its own corresponding group of elements.In the field of photography, it is known for a
rotatable film spool to include a coaxial disk having a
bar code symbol which consists of a sequence of radially
extending white and black bars or elements. For example,
see commonly assigned U.S. Patents No. 5,023,642, issued
June 11, 1991, No. 5,030,978, issued July 9, 1991, and 
No. 5,032,854, issued July 16, 1991. The black bars are
printed in spaced relation on an otherwise white bar code
label that is adhered to the spool disk. The bar code
symbol that results is used to provide film-related
information, such as film speed (ISO), film type, total
number of film exposures available, etc..In the disclosure of these patents, the radial bar
coded disk is comprised of a data segment, consisting of
alternate white and black bars, and an extended
synchronizing segment consisting of an extended black
segment, referred to as a quiet zone, and an optional
white segment referred to as a start bar. The disk is
disposed on the opposite end of the film spool from the
drive end. As specifically, disclosed in the '854
patent, the bar coded disk, in addition to providing
information about the film on the spool, can also be
employed in conjunction with suitable control circuits in
the camera to provide control of the stopping position of
the spool at the end of rewind to provide a visual
indication of the exposure
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A photographic film cassette comprising a light
tight housing (5,7), a rotatable film spool (11), the spool having a

radial bar coded disk (45) mounted thereon for rotation with
the spool and defining a radial bar coded disk end of the spool, characterized by:


the housing having a circumferential lip portion (68) at
the radial bar coded disk end of the spool adapted for

engagement with a mechanical double exposure prevention
hook (52) in the the cassette receiving chamber (51) of a camera as the

cassette is loaded endwise into the camera; and
the radial bar coded disk having a first arcuate
segment (DS) extending to the circumferential lip portion to

inhibit engagement of the hook with the lip portion of
the cassette housing when an indicator flag (43) on the opposite end of the spool with respect to the disk is rotationally

positioned to indicate that film (13) in the cassette is
unexposed and having a second arcuate segment (QZ) extending

part way to the lip portion to define a gap between the
disk and the lip portion thereby to allow the hook to

engage the lip portion when the indicator flag is rotationally
positioned to indicate that at least some of the film in

the cassette is exposed so as to prevent insertion of the cassette in the cassette receiving chamber.
The cassette of claim 1 wherein the first
arcuate segment of the disk comprises a radial bar coded

data segment providing data concerning characteristics of
film in the cassette.
The cassette of claim 1 wherein the second
arcuate segment of the disk comprises an extended

synchronizing segment of the disk.
The cassette of claim 1 wherein the radial bar
coded disc is mounted on the drive end of the film spool.
