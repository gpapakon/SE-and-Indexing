<ABSTRACT>
An image display system which provides first and 
second images such that the right eye and the left eye 

of an observer see the first and second images at 
different times
, respectively. The image display system 
comprises a camera for taking a picture of the observer 

and then outputting an image of the observer; a liquid 
crystal display device transparent to light, for 

displaying the first and second images at the different 
times, respectively; a back-lighting device which 

displays back light images to illuminate the liquid 
crystal display device from a back side thereof, at the 

different times; and an optical element for giving 
directivity to back light emitted by the back-lighting 

device so that the back-lighting device provides back 
light illuminations of the LCD device for the right and 

left eyes at the different times. The apparatus 
detects centroids or contours of images of the observer 

taken by the camera, and generates the back-light 
images on the basis of the centroids or contours. The 

apparatus synchronizes the display of the back-light 
images with the display of the first and second images, 

respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display system
for displaying an image, and more particularly to a
display system for displaying a stereoscopic image for
industrial, medical, or domestic use.In a conventional stereoscopic display system, an
observer wears glasses for separating right and left
images from each other whereby right and left eyes of
the observer can selectively see right and left target
images, respectively, which are displayed on an image
screen in a time-division fashion. In another
conventional technique, a lenticular plate is attached
to an image screen so that the lenticular plate can
separate right and left images from each other and thus
right and left eyes of the observer can selectively see
right and left target images, respectively.Figure 1 illustrates an example of the
configuration of the above-described conventional
stereoscopic-image display system, which includes
glasses 60 capable of separating right and left images
from each other, liquid crystal shutters 61a and 61b, a
synchronous circuit 62, and color CRT 63 serving as an 
image display device.The above first example of a stereoscopic-image
display system having such a configuration operates as
follows. The color CRT 63 displays stereoscopic images
wherein images for right and left eyes are displayed
alternately in a time-division fashion. Under the
control of the synchronous circuit 62, the liquid
crystal shutter 61a of the glasses 60 is opened and
thus become transparent only when stereoscopic images
for the right eye are displayed, and the liquid crystal
shutter 61b is opened and become transparent only when
stereoscopic images for the left eye are displayed. As
a result, an observer wearing the glasses 60 can
observe stereoscopic images for the right eye with his
or her right eye, and stereoscopic images for the left
eye with the left eye. In this way, stereoscopic vision
is provided.Figure 2 illustrates the configuration of the
second example of a conventional stereoscopic-image
display system, which includes a lenticular plate 71
having a large number of stripe-shaped cylindrical
lenses and a color CRT 72 serving as an image display
device.This second example of stereoscopic-image display
system having such a configuration operates as follows.
The color CRT 72 displays simultaneously both 
stereoscopic images for right and left eyes such that
images for right and left eyes are displayed
alternately on each half-width stripe of the lenticular
plate 71. The right eye of an observer sees only the
stereoscopic images
