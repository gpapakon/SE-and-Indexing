 NOVEL CHROMOPHORES FOR POLYMERIC THIN FILMS AND OPTICAL WAVEGUIDES AND DEVICES COMPRISING THE SAMECROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to, and the benefit of, US Patent Application09/595,221 filed June 16, 2000 entitled "Novel Chromophores For Polymeric Thin Films And Optical Waveguides And Devices Comprising The Same," and US Patent Application 09/675,966 filed September 29, 2000 entitled "Novel Chromophores For Polymeric Thin Films And Optical Waveguides And Devices Comprising The Same." FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to chromophores which can be used in the preparation of polymeric thin films for waveguide media, and to optical waveguides and devices comprising the chromophores. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThin films of organic or polymeric materials with large second order nonlinearities in combination with silicon-based electronic circuitry can be used in systems for laser modulation and deflection, information control in optical circuitry, as well as in numerous other waveguide applications. In addition, novel processes through third order nonlinearity such as degenerate four-wave mixing, whereby real-time processing of optical fields occurs, have utility in such diverse fields as optical communications and integrated circuit fabrication. The utility of organic materials with large second order and third order nonlinearities for very high frequency application contrasts with the bandwidth limitations of conventional inorganic electrooptic materials currently in use.Numerous optically responsive monomers and polymers have been developed for use in organic materials which, in turn, can be used in the waveguide applications described above. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,044,725, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes numerous polymer compositions which provide suitable nonlinear optical response. U.S. Patent No. 5,044,725 describes, for example, a preferred polymer composition comprising an organic chromophore containing an electron donating group and an electron withdrawing group at opposing termini of a bridge.Synthesis of high performance organic, high μβ electro-optic chromophores must be accomplished in order to make polymer-based electro-optic waveguides and devices. The synthesis of electro-optic chromophore bridge compounds and donor-bridge compounds for organic nonlinear optical applications are generally known in the art. Although some chromophores have been reported in the literature, many of them
