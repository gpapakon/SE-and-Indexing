<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a method for mapping an input 
color space to an output color space in such a way that the 

color reproduction characteristics of the saturated colors 
can be adjusted in a custom manner, while maintaining the 

desired tone reproduction on the neutral axis. This is 
accomplished by defining independently a tone 

transformation and a transformation for a plurality of 
highly saturated colors. A transformation is formed for 

the remaining color values having the specified transforms 
for the neutral and saturated colors as boundary values. 

In the preferred embodiment multi-dimensional look-up 
tables are used to implement the transform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related to U.S.
Patent N° US 5 583 666 (Pub. Date Dec. 12, 1996 Serial No. 17094/93) entitled, "Method
for Cross-device Color Calibration and Enhancement Using
Explicit Constraints" (corresponds to EP-A-611 231 published
Aug. 17, 1994).The present invention relates to the field of
color calibration and color enhancement for digital
imaging systems. More specifically the invention is
directed to a technique for transforming one device-dependent
color space to another device-dependent color
space which transforming maintains the saturation of the
primary colors and other saturated colors in the input
color space.For color digital imaging systems, each step of
the imaging chain (original scene, image capture, image
storage, image transmission, soft display, hard copy
display, etc.) will, in general, have different device-dependent
color spaces, as well as different color
gamuts. The term color gamut is generally used to refer
to the range of colors which can be represented and/or
displayed at some particular stage in the system. The
color gamut of a display device may be quite different
from the gamut of the image capture device and/or the
gamut of colors in some original real world scene.
Additionally, the gamut of colors which can be displayed
with one device may be substantially different from the
color gamut of some other device. For example, consider 
Fig. 1 which illustrates the color gamut of a typical RGB
color video monitor, as compared to the gamut of a Kodak
XL7700 color printer. The plot shows a slice through the
gamuts in CIELAB color space at a lightness value of
L*=50.0. The area of overlap for the two gamuts
indicates the colors which can be produced on both
devices. The regions that are inside only one of the
curves represent colors that can be produced on one
device, but not on the other. The color values that are
outside both curves cannot be produced by either device.
For this example, it can be seen that the video monitor
can produce much more saturated blues than the thermal
printer at this lightness level. The thermal printer, on
the other hand, can produce more saturated yellows.In many applications, it is necessary to take
color image data which exists in a color space for one
specific device, and transform it onto a color space for
a different device. Because of the differences in the
color spaces and the color gamuts of the various devices,
several problems arise in this process. The first one is
the matter of color calibration. That is, how do you
