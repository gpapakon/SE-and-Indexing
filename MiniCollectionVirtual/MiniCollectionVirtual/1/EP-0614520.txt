<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical temperature 
sensor having a birefringent element made of a single 
crystal metal oxide plate. A broad band light spectrum is 
transmitted through a first linear polarizing element to 
create a linearly polarized wave. The linearly polarized 
wave on passing through the single crystal plate decomposes 
into first and second orthogonally polarized waves. 
Propagation of the linearly polarized wave through the 
birefringent single crystal metal oxide plate introduces a 
temperature dependent phase shift between the two waves. 
Thereafter, a second linear polarizer combines the first and 
second orthogonally polarized waves to create a modulated 
light spectrum. Information derived from this modulated 
light spectrum or fringe pattern is then used to measure the 
temperature of the birefringent single crystal metal oxide 
plate. It is common practice to electrically transmit 
operational parameters from point to point through bundles 
of copper wires. Although these bundles may be shielded, 
electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic pulse can 
effect the electrical signals carried on these copper wires. 
In an effort to eliminate this interference and at the same 
time reduce the weight of the transmission lines, it has 
become desirable to transmit the operational parameters in 
the form of optical signals through optical fibers. U.S. Patent 4,598,996 discloses a detector system 
which uses optical fibers for communicating changes in the 
refraction index of birefringent crystals such as LiTaO3 or 
SrxBa1-xNb2O6 to measure temperature in an environment. The 
sensor in this detector utilizes a relatively narrow 
spectral band excitation source and relies on the detection 
of the change in transmitted intensity which varies 
sinusoidally with temperature. Hence, the practical 
measurement range is limited to less than one half of the 
period of the oscillatory output, and the accuracy of 
measurement is limited by uncertainties imposed by the 
intensity detection scheme. Moreover, the sensor materials,  
 
LiTaO3 and SrxBa1-xNb2O6, experience ferroelectric Curie 
transitions at 660°C and 270°C maximum, respectively, and 
therefore can not be used in an environment where the 
temperatures is higher than 660°C. U.S. Patent 4,928,005 
discloses a detector system having a multiple point sensor 
wherein the birefringent properties of a polarization 
maintaining glass fiber is used to measure temperature. As 
with the sensor disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,598,996, the
