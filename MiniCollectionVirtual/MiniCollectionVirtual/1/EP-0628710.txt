<ABSTRACT>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine of a 
motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12) having 

an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38) extending 
therethrough and an outer wall (40), the bore having a 

longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14) extending across 
the bore and having a longitudinal axis (Y) 

substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 
of the bore, the shaft being rotatably mounted in the 

inner wall of the throttle body for pivotal movement 
about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, at least one 

end (42) of the shaft passing through the inner wall 
to extend beyond the outer wall; a flap valve (16) 

secured to the shaft inside the bore for movement 
between a fully open position and a substantially 

closed position on rotation of the shaft; means 
(18,20) secured to the said at least one end of the 

shaft adjacent the outer wall for rotating the shaft; 
and fluid heating means (34) comprising a recess (96) 

formed in the outer wall of the throttle body; a plate 
member (98) sealably secured to the outer wall to 

cover the recess; an inlet pipe (102) and an outlet 
(104) pipe extending through the plate member to allow 

fluid to pass through the inlet pipe into the recess 
and out through the outlet pipe; and securing means 

(110-116) engageable with the peripheral edge (108) of 
the plate member to secure the plate member to the 

outer wall and to determine the position of the inlet 
and outlet pipes relative to the throttle body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a throttle
mechanism for an engine of a motor vehicle.There are numerous designs of throttle
mechanisms for engines which are well known to those
skilled in the art. These known throttle mechanisms
basically comprise a throttle body with a bore
therethrough, a shaft extending across the bore and
having a flap valve secured thereto, and means for
rotating the shaft relative to the throttle body.
Generally, the problem associated with these known
designs is that for each design of engine, and/or for
each application of the throttle mechanism, a
different design of throttle mechanism is required in
terms of the layout of the throttle mechanism and/or
the layout of the elements attached to, or forming
part of, the throttle mechanism. JP-A-3156134
describes a throttle mechanism in accordance with the
preamble of claim 1. EP-A-302438 describes a heated
engine intake pipe for preventing throttle valve
freezing.It is an object of the present invention to
overcome one or more of these disadvantages.A throttle mechanism in accordance with the
present invention is characterised over JP-A-3156134 by
the features specified in the characterising portion
of claim 1. This arrangement provides means by which the
positioning and orientation of the inlet and outlet
pipes relative to the throttle body, and hence
relative to the engine, can easily be adjusted to meet
the requirements of the layout for the throttle
mechanism relative to the engine.The present invention will now be described,
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is a plan view of a throttle
mechanism in accordance with the present invention;Figure 2 is an end view of a manifold to
which the throttle mechanism of Figure 1 can be
attached; Figure 3 is a plan view of an air horn which
is attached to the throttle mechanism of Figure 1; Figure 4 is a side view in the direction of
arrow IV in Figure 1 showing the attachment of the
throttle position sensor and the idle air control
valve motor but with other features omitted for
clarity; Figure 5 is a side view in the direction of
arrow V in Figure 1 showing the fluid heating means
and the air horn positioned on the throttle body but
with other features omitted for clarity;  Figure 6 is a side view in the direction of
arrow VI in Figure 1 showing the throttle linkage and
idle adjust means but with other features omitted for
clarity;Figure 7 is a view similar to that of Figure
6 with the positions of the throttle linkage and idle
adjust means

<CLAIMS>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine
of a motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12)

having an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38)
extending therethrough and an outer wall (40), the

bore having a longitudinal axis (X); a shaft (14)

extending across the bore and having a longitudinal
axis (Y) substantially perpendicular to the

longitudinal axis of the bore, the shaft being
rotatably mounted in the inner wall of the throttle

body for pivotal movement about the longitudinal axis
of the shaft, at least one end (42) of the shaft

passing through the inner wall to extend beyond the
outer wall; a flap valve (16) secured to the shaft

inside the bore for movement between a fully open
position and a substantially closed position on

rotation of the shaft; means (18,20) secured to the
said at least one end of the shaft adjacent the outer

wall for rotating the shaft; and fluid flow means (34)
comprising a recess (96) formed in the outer wall of

the throttle body; a plate member (98) sealably
secured to the outer wall to cover the recess; an

inlet pipe (102) and an outlet pipe (104) extending
through the plate member to allow fluid to pass

through the inlet pipe into the recess and out through
the outlet pipe; and securing means (110-116) to

secure the plate member to the outer wall;

characterised in that the fluid flow means is fluid
heating means (34) ; and in that the securing means

(110-116) is engageable with the peripheral edge (108)
of the plate member (98) to secure the plate member to

the outer wall when the inlet and outlet pipes
(102,104) are in one of a number of possible

predetermined positions relative to the throttle body
(12). 
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim
1, wherein the securing means comprises at least one

threaded member (110) having a threaded shank (112)
threadingly engaged in a threaded bore (114) in the 

outer wall (40) and a head (116) engageable with the
peripheral edge (108) of the plate member (98).
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim
2, wherein the plate member (98) has a plurality of

indentations (106) in its peripheral edge (108) which
have a shape corresponding to the shape of a portion

of the head (116) of the threaded member (110), the
head engaging one of the indentations to determine the

orientation of the plate member relative to the
throttle body (12).
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim
3, wherein the indentations (106) are substantially

equidistantly spaced around the periphery (108) of the
plate member (98).
A throttle mechanism as claimed in any
one of Claims 2 to 4 comprising two threaded members

(110) engageable with the peripheral edge (108) of the
plate member (98) on substantially diametrically

opposed sides thereof.
A throttle mechanism as claimed in Claim
1 or Claim 2, wherein an annular member (164) is

positioned to overlie and engage the peripheral edge
(108') of the plate member (98') to secure the plate

member to the outer wall (40) of the throttle body
(12); and the throttle mechanism comprises two

threaded members (110), the heads (116) of which
engage and secure the annular member to the outer

wall.

1, wherein the securing means comprises a number of

lips (166) integrally formed in the outer wall (40) of
the throttle body (12), the lips being swaged over to

engage the peripheral edge (108') of the plate member

A throttle mechanism as claimed in any
one of Claims 1 to 7 comprising a sealing ring (100)
