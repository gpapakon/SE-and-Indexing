<ABSTRACT>
A laser balloon catheter apparatus for emitting in a 
balloon, laser lights which are transmitted through optical 

fibers (2) and for irradiating the tissue with the laser lights 
transmitted through the balloon, comprises laser light emitting 

means, a coolant supply passage (N) located in said balloon; a 
coolant discharge passage (4A) for discharging the coolant; and 

coolant circulating means for supplying the coolant to the 
balloon through said coolant supply passage to inflate the 

balloon while discharging the coolant through said coolant 
discharge passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser balloon catheter
which is inserted into the body cavities such as the gullet, the
stomach and the prostate for the laser treatment thereof.Laser balloon catheters are used for opening the clogged
portions of the blood vessels. Hyperthermia treatment using the
laser balloon catheters for irradiating the cancer tissues with
laser lights are conducted.The structure of such type of the laser balloon catheters
is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,512,762. In this
U.S. Patent, a lumen tube surrounding optical fibers is provided
and a balloon is provided at the front end of the optical fibers
to surround the front end thereof.Another structure of the catheter in which a balloon is
provided with an acoustic sensor for controlling the vaporization
of the tissue is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,799,479. Still another catheter structure is described in U.S. Patent
No. 4,878,492. This structure comprises tip assembly means
coupled to an optical fiber for better directing laser
radiation outwardly through a major portion of the surface of
the catheter balloon.Another catheter apparatus which is also directed on
providing a high power output of laser light through the
catheter balloon is disclosed in the EP-A-0 448 004. The
balloon described therein is inflated with a fluid having a
high absorption coefficient with respect to the wave length
of the laser light used.These prior art catheter apparatuses are specifically used
for the treatment of atherosclerosis or for coronary
angioplasty. Accordingly, they are mainly aimed at delivering
a relatively high proportion if input laser radiation through
the balloon wall to the surrounding tissue.However, when a laser balloon catheter is inserted into the
urethra to heat the prostate for the treatment thereof, the
prostate is located about 5 to 15 mm deeper from the inner
wall 
of the urethra. When the power of the laser lights is increased
to heat the prostate to a given temperature, the inner wall of
the urethra and the tissue in the vicinity thereof is excessively
heated to damage the tissue in the vicinity of the urethra.
Curing will become difficult.Also in the treatments other than the prostate treatment,
the inner wall of a body cavity into which a laser balloon
catheter is inserted is kept at a low temperature to protect the
tissue in the vicinity of the inner wall from being thermally
damaged and in stead of this, the tissue which is deeper than the
inner wall may be wanted to be intensively warmed or heated.The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A laser balloon catheter apparatus for emitting in a
balloon (10, 101), laser lights which are transmitted through optical

fibers (2) and for irradiating the tissue with the laser lights
transmitted through the balloon, comprising


laser light emitting means (2, 38A), characterized in that
it further comprises


a coolant supply passage (18) located in said balloon;
a coolant discharge passage (20) for discharging the coolant; and
coolant circulating means (28, 30) for supplying the coolant to the
balloon (10) through said coolant supply passage (18) to inflate the

balloon while discharging the coolant through said coolant
discharge passage (20).
A laser balloon catheter apparatus as defined in Claim

1 and further including temperature detecting means (14A) for
directly or indirectly detecting the temperature of the tissue which is

irradiated with laser lights and means (24) for adjusting the laser
light emitting period of time per unit time in accordance with

a signal representing the temperature of the tissue from the
temperature detecting means.
A laser balloon catheter apparatus as defined in Claim
2 in which the temperature detecting means (14A) has an detecting end

which is provided on the surface of the balloon.
A laser balloon catheter apparatus 
as defined in at least one of the preceding claims, further

including a first guide (4) through which said optical fibers (2)
extend and having a front end portion located in the balloon

and having at the front end portion a communicating hole
which communicates the inside of the guide with the inside of

the balloon;

securing means (12) for securing the front end portion of the
optical fibers to the first guide (4);

a second guide (8) which is provided coaxially with and around
the first guide and having a front end which is communicated

with the inside of the balloon;

the coolant supply passage (18) being one of a space in said first
guide (4) and a space between the first and second guide, the

coolant discharge passage (20) being the other of the spaces, and
a communicating hole for the coolant being formed through

said securing means or between the securing means and the
first guide. 
A laser balloon catheter apparatus as defined in Claim
4 in which the mouth of the balloon is secured to the front end

of the first guide.
A laser balloon catheter apparatus as defined in Claim
4 in which said guide (4, 8) is made of a flexible material and has a 

balloon portion having a large diameter at the front end portion
thereof, the balloon portion being sealingly secured at the front

end thereof to a shoe member (6) disposed in front of said laser
light emitting means.
