<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulically damping bearing bushing with a bearing core (1) and an outer tube (10), between which there are radially extending supporting springs (2, 3) and radial supporting lugs (6, 7) between the bearing core (1) and the outer tube (10) and two fluid-filled chambers (11, 12) which are formed thereby and are connected to one another via an annular passage (19). To facilitate assembly and increase stiffness at large amplitudes, the invention envisages that all the elastomeric regions in the form of the two supporting springs (2, 3), the supporting lugs (6, 7) and of a cylindrical diaphragm-shaped elastomer part (17) extending along the bearing core (1) between the two supporting springs (2, 3) be produced and vulcanised as an integral moulding and that radially extending bead-shaped stop rings (20, 21) be arranged on the ends of the bearing core (1) in the region of the inward-curving wall regions (4, 5) of the supporting springs (2, 3).

A hydraulically damping bearing bush, more particularly, for motor
vehicles, comprising a hollow cylindrical bearing core (1) and an outer tube

(10) between which supporting springs (2, 3) of an elastomeric material
having a wall part (4,5) curved inwards oriented substantially radially at

the face end as well as radial supporting cleats (6, 7) oriented horizontally
at both ends between said bearing core (1) and said outer tube (10) are

arranged, said cleats dividing the space between said supporting springs
(2, 3) into an upper and lower chamber (11, 12) filled with fluid, said

chambers being connected to each other via an annular passage (19), all
elastomeric portions in the form of said two supporting springs (2, 3), said

supporting cleats (6, 7)) as well as a cylindrical, diaphragmatic elastomeric
part (17) extending between said two supporting springs (2, 3) along said

bearing core (1) being fabricated and vulcanized as an integral molding,
and radially extending bead-shaped stop rings (20, 21) being arranged on

the ends of said bearing core (1) in the region of said inwardly curved wall
portions (4,5) of said supporting springs (2, 3), characterized in that

running between said supporting cleats (6, 7) and said outer tube (10) is
an additional, circular section-shaped passage (30) of defined length

having reduced inlet and outlet ports (32, 33), a spherical or cylindrical
mass (31) having a slightly smaller diameter than that of said passage (3)

being included in said passage (3).
The bearing bush according to claim 1, characterized in that
arranged inside said outer tube (10) between said two supporting springs

(2, 3) is a cylindrical sleeve (13) having in the middle a radial recess (14)
forming with said outer tube (10) said annular-shaped overflow passage

(19).
The bearing bush according to claim 1, characterized in that said
radial supporting cleats (6, 7) comprise a central hollow chamber (25, 26)

extending longitudinally.
The bearing bush according to claim 2, characterized in that
arranged within said fluid chambers (11, 12) and adjoining said sleeve (13) 

comprising said overflow passage is an absorber (35, 36) of an elastomeric
material having gas bubble inclusions.
The bearing bush according to claim 1, characterized in that said bearing
core (1) is provided in the portion of said diaphragmatic elastomeric part

(17) with an annular recess (18) forming an air gap to said elastomeric
part (17) located above, acting as a decoupling diaphragm.
