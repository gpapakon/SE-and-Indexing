<ABSTRACT>
A disposable absorbent pad comprises a pad proper (1) adapted to present 
a boat-shape under the contraction of elastic members (10) contained in 

respective side flaps (8). Front and rear ends of said pad proper (1) are connected 
to front and rear ends of an annular elastic waist band (2) by respective pairs of 

elastic suspending straps (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to so-called
disposable absorbent pads, particularly such as
incontinence pads, sanitary pads or menstruation pads,
adapted to be used only once and then thrown away.So far as it is known to the inventors, there are
several articles of prior art used as incontinence guards
which are partially similar in their constructions to a
disposable absorbent pad of the present invention. For
example, the specification of U.S. Patent No. 3,452,753
discloses an article comprising a water-impermeable outer
cover (not disposable) designed for elastic fitting around
the wearer's waist- and leg-openings and a support attached
to the inner side of the cover for a separate absorbent pad,
and Japanese Patent Application Disclosure Gazette No.
1982-143502 discloses an article comprising an elastically
stretchable waist band and straps interconnected so as to
form a supporter (not disposable) to support a separate
absorbent pad, wherein the supporter surrounds the wearer's
legs not completely but partially.These well known techniques are similar to the 
invention in that there are provided straps connected to an
elastically stretchable waist band to support an absorbent
pad in direct or indirect manner and a basic body or
supporter is configured so as to surround the wearer's legs
not completely but partially.There are many other well known incontinence guard
articles, for example, a disposable incontinence guard
article comprising a liquid-permeable topsheet, a liquid-impermeable
backsheet, a liquid-absorbent core sandwiched
between these two sheets, and elastically stretchable
members arranged along waist- and leg-openings and such an
article further comprising a separate absorbent pad to be
attached to the inner side of the article.Straps employed by the prior art disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 3,452,753 appear to be provided for the purpose
of assuring a stability with which a pad proper of the
article can be put on the wearer's body, and the strap
employed by the prior art disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Disclosure Gazette No.1982-143502 functions
only as a component of the supporter.These straps have no elastic stretchability and
therefore no function for pulling the basic body or
supporter up toward the wearer's crotch. Accordingly, the 
absorbent pad is not maintained in sufficiently close
contact with the wearer's crotch to prevent the leakage of
excretion from occurring around this zone.WO-A-9108725 discloses a disposable absorbent
garment having a belt and a detachable

<CLAIMS>
A disposable absorbent pad comprising a pad proper (1)
and an elastic waist band (2), said pad proper (1)

comprising a liquid-permeable topsheet (4), a liquid-impermeable
backsheet (5) and an absorbent core (6)

sandwiched between these two sheets (4,5), and side flaps
(8) extending outward from laterally opposite side edges of

said core (6), said side flaps (8) being provided at least
adjacent their outer side edges with elastic members (10)

stretchable longitudinally of said outer side edges, and
said side flaps (8) being each folded inward, and

longitudinally opposite ends of said side flaps (8) thus
folded inward being fixed, in their longitudinally stretched

states, to said pad proper (1), and said pad also including
means (3) connecting a longitudinally front end of said pad

proper (1) to a front side of said waist band (2) and a
longitudinally rear end of said pad proper (1) to a rear

side of said waist band (2); characterised in that the
elastic waist band (2) is annular, and said connecting means

(3) comprise respective pairs of elastic suspending straps
(3) spaced from each other.
A disposable absorbent pad according to claim 1,
wherein sleeves (9) are formed along respective outer side

edges of said side flaps (8) and said elastic members (10)
are received by said sleeves (9), respectively, so that said

elastic members (10) extend beyond longitudinally opposite
ends of the respective sleeves (9) and these extensions

define said suspending straps (3).
A disposable absorbent pad according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein each pair of straps (3) is connected to said waist

band (2) at two positions further spaced from each other
than two positions at which this pair of straps (3) is

connected to one of said longitudinally opposite ends of
said pad prope
r (1). 
A disposable absorbent pad according to claim 1, 2 or
3, wherein said side flaps (8) are formed by at least

portions of said top- and backsheets (4,5) extending from
the laterally opposite side edges of said core (6).
A disposable absorbent pad according to any preceding
claim, wherein said pad is adapted to present a boat-shape

under the contraction of the elastic members (10) of said
side flaps (3).
