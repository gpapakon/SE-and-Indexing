<ABSTRACT>
A medicine dosing and body fluid collecting unit and an apparatus capable of sufficiently increasing a medicine absorption 
rate with a low applied voltage and collecting a sufficient quantity of body fluid with a low applied voltage. Electrodes (7a, 

7b) with which a DC voltage is applied and ultrasonic vibration elements (8a, 8b) are provided on the inner side of containers (4a, 
4b) which have openings (3a, 3b) on the skin-contacting side thereof, and which is filled with a body liquid, to form medicine dosing 

and body fluid collecting units (A, B), which are provided on a common adhesive sheet (1) to form a medicine dosing and 

body fluid collecting apparatus. According to the present invention, a sufficient level of electric current flows in the skin even 
when a voltage applied between the electrodes is lowered with the electrical resistance of the skin decreased by the irradiation of 

the skin with ultrasonic waves, the dosing of a medicine and collection of a body fluid which are based on electrophoresis are carried 
out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a unit and
apparatus for drug administration and humor sampling by
using electrophoresis.The treatment with percutaneous drug
administration generally involves drugs in the form of a
solution or ointment being applied to the skin to enable
the drugs to be absorbed within their affected area.
Although the absorption of the percutaneously applied
drug is accomplished primarily through diffusion, the
natural biophylaxic functions of the skin to prevent
foreign matters such as medicines, microbes, and viruses
from penetrating into the human body prevent most of the
medicine from being absorbed. Furthermore, the
absorption rate of the medicines that are successfully
absorbed is made quite slow. There have been devised
various methods for improving the absorption rate of
drugs for the endermatic absorption.One of the methods for improving the drug
absorption rate is iontophoresis (iontophorese)
described, for example, in MORIMOTO's "Development of 
TTS drugs in the United States," Therapeutic Research,
Vol. 10, No. 3, 1989, pp.169(889) - pp.180(900).Iontophorese, namely iontophoresis, is a sort of
electrotherapeutic method for introducing percutaneously
or transmucosally predetermined medicines into a living
body without pain by use of a direct current (refer to
Nanzando's Medical Dictionary, published April 10,
1974). As shown in Fig. 9, by providing electrodes 32a
and 32b onto drug containers 31a and 31b and by
providing the DC potential difference between respective
electrodes 32a and 32b, charged substances are
transferred to within the skin A along with lines of the
electrodynamic force. That is, positively charged
substances will be attracted to the negative electrode
32b side, and negatively charged substances to the
positive electrode 32a side. While transferring, the
medicines will be absorbed into the bloodstream and
transferred to whole body. Iontophoresis has the
advantage of drug absorption being promoted, since, in
addition to the effect of the concentration gradient,
the drug may also be absorbed by the effect of
electrophoresis.As iontophorese sends an electric current through
skin, if the resistance of the skin is increased, higher
voltage must be applied to provide a sufficient current.
This may cause low-temperature burning of the skin or
patient discomfort. These problems may be avoided by
lowering the applied voltage. In this case, however, 
the reduced amount of drug transfer by electrophoresis
may not sufficiently increase the absorption rate of the
drug.
