<DESCRIPTION>
 DUAL MODE GEN-LOCK SYSTEM WHICH AUTOMATICALLYLOCKS TO COLOR BURST OR TO SYNC INFORMATIONTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to apparatus and methods for generating a clock output for synchronizing a video system to an external video signal. Background Of The InventionIt is sometimes desirable to have the capability of synchronizing together two or more video systems. For example, in a television news broadcasting studio, it may be desirable to switch between a "live" presentation of the news commentators on one camera, a videotape on a second camera, and a slide presentation on a third camera. In order to accomplish this switching without diminishing picture quality, it is necessary to synchronize the operation of all three cameras. More particularly, if independent video systems do not operate in continuous synchronization, switching between one video system and the other for broadcast transmission can cause the video picture to be adversely affected, such as by rolling in the vertical and tearing in the horizontal. This can occur until the systems have become synchronized together.Conventionally, master sync generators have been incorporated into video cameras. A conventional method of syncing two or more cameras is to have a lead camera set to an internal mode for generating a composite video signal, with the sync generators in the remaining cameras locked to this video signal. 

 In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a video system which utilizes an image sensor such as a charge coupled device (CCD) to generate video images. It is an object of the present invention to synchronize the imager to an external video signal. However, the CCD sensor utilizes a clocking signal which has a much higher frequency than is present in a conventional video signal. Therefore, in order to minimize the differential between the imager clocking frequency and the external video frequency, the highest frequency portion, i.e., color burst, of the external video signal is utilized whenever possible as a reference to generate the signal for clocking the imager. However, in the absence of a color burst signal in the external video such as during the transmission of black and white video, or during the vertical blanking interval, it is desirable that the next highest frequency available in the composite video signal, i.e. horizontal sync information, be utilized as a reference for generating the CCD clocking signal.A number of conventional synchronization systems have been disclosed.
