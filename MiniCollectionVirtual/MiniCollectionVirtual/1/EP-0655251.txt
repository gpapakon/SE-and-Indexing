<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating 
bone fracture comprising as an active ingredient a platelet 

factor 4. 
The present composition can promote differentiation of 
osteoblasts so that they are effective for prophylaxis and 

treatment of such diseases requiring bone differentiation and 
proliferation as bone fracture and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of platelet factor 4 for the
manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for
preventing or treating bone formation-relating diseases,
particularly fractures.Bones maintain a supporting function as endoskeleton by
repeated local bone resorption and bone formation to
substitute old bones with new ones and they also prepare for a
rapid reactivity to various mechanical stresses and changes in
mineral balance. This osteoanagenesis is performed mainly by
bone resorption cells such as osteoclasts and the like and
bone formation cells such as osteoblasts and the like, based
upon coupling of both cells. Recently, osteoblasts have been
reported not only to have the function of bone formation, but
to closely relate to differentiation and activation of
osteoclasts, so that there may be an increased possibility of
playing a role as a controlling center in cellular bone
reconstruction [Inoue, T., Mebio (1990), Special Version p. 2-7].The platelet factor 4 (PF4) is the protein which is
characteristic of platelet and may be specifically bound to
heparin to neutralize the anticoagulant activity of heparin. 
And further, it is known that PF4 may act as a chemotactic
factor on leukocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts and show an
anti-collagenase activity for protecting tissues from
impairment caused by the collagenase released from leukocytes
(polynuclear neutrophils) in inflammatory lesions. It was
also elucidated that human PF4 blocked reversibly parathyroid
hormone(PTH)-stimulated 45Ca2+ release from newborn rat bone
in vitro [Horton, J.E., et al., Biochem. Biophys, Acta.
(1980), Vol. 630, p. 459-462]. Recently, human PF4 has been
found to inhibit human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos-2 and G-292
proliferation, from which the antitumor effect is expected
[Tatakis, D.N., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (1992), Vol.
187, p. 287-293].Human PF4 was found to be composed of 70 amino acids and
bovine PF4 was found to be the polypeptide composed of 88
amino acids, while the respective sequences were determined
[Hermodson, M., et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1977), Vol. 252, p.
6276-6278; Ciaglowski, R.E., et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys.
(1986), Vol. 250, p. 249-256].PF4 is released from platelets in the binding form with
proteoglycan, but it is believed that proteoglycan may be
replaced with heparin. Recently, there has been investigated
determination of PF4 values in plasma by radioimmunoassay.
PF4 activity has been abundantly detected in the fraction
containing Î±-granules which were isolated by the
