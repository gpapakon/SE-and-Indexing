<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for triggering control signals depending on the angular position of a rotary part (19). The rotary part (19) has angle marks (20) distributed around its circumference, as in a toothed wheel. In order to detect the angular position of the rotary part (19), a first sensor (21) is used which emit an angle mark signal with every revolution of an angle mark (20). The angle mark signals are supplied to a first counter (14). The control signals are triggered depending on the result of the count of the first counter (14). In addition, a second sensor (25) is provided, whose signals have a fixed relation to the angle mark signals of the first sensor (21). The regular occurrence of angle mark signals is monitored in use. When an irregular occurrence of angle mark signals is detected, an emergency operation mode is started, in which first and second values for simulating angle mark signals are calculated from the sequence in time of the signals from the second sensor (25). The count of the second counter (13) is compared with the first and second values. When the count of the second counter (13) coincides with previously calculated first or second values, flanks of simulated angle mark signals are generated and supplied to the first counter (14).
