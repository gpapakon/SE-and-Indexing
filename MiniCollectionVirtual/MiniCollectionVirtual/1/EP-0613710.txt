<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure describes a filtering apparatus 
10 and a method for manufacturing a filtering apparatus 

comprising a housing 11 and a filter arrangement 
12 disposed within the housing 11. The housing 11 

may have first and second identical body portions 23, 
24. The filter arrangement 12, which may include an 

end cap 45 and a filter element 36, may be secured 
within the housing 11 solely by mechanical compression

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to filters and, more 
particularly, to an apparatus for filtering impurities 
from a fluid, i.e., a liquid or a gas, and a method of 
manufacturing such a filtering apparatus. A fluid may contain many different impurities, and, in a 
variety of circumstances, these impurities must be removed 
before the fluid can be used. For example, in many 
medical applications, impurities must be filtered from a 
liquid before the liquid can be passed into a patient. Ideally, a filtering apparatus for removing impurities 
from a fluid would be as inexpensive as possible. This is 
especially true in the medical field where skyrocketing 
costs are a major burden, and the expense of an apparatus 
or procedure may limit the availability of the apparatus 
or procedure. DE-A-2720012 discloses filtering apparatus in which end 
units are joined to a body. Both end units have pegs. The 
pegs of one end unit locate one end of a cylindrical 
filter medium. The other end of the medium carries a cap 
which closes that end of the medium and which is spaced 
from the other end cap by the pegs of that end cap. Accordingly, the present invention provides an apparatus 
for filtering a fluid comprising a housing having first 
and second openings and defining a fluid flow path between 
the first and second openings, the housing including 
identical first and second body portions joined to one 
another, and a filter arrangement disposed within the  
 
housing in the fluid flow path and including a filter 
element having a first surface communicating with the 
first opening and a second surface communicating with the 
second opening, the filter arrangement being secured 
within the housing solely by mechanical compression 
between the first and second body portions, and a 
plurality of ribs provided within each body portion, the 
ribs of the second body portion engaging an exterior of 
the filter element to center the filter element within the 
housing.  Various aspects of the present invention each 
contribute to a reduction in the cost of the filtering 
apparatus. For example, by forming the housing from two 
identical body portions, the expense of making a mold 
for more than one body portion and the expense of 
separate molding procedures for more than one body 
portion are eliminated. By securing the filter 
arrangement within the housing solely by mechanical 
compression, the filter apparatus may be more quickly 
and, therefore, more inexpensively manufactured because 
the additional step of adhering

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for filtering a fluid comprising a 
housing (11) having first and second openings (13,14) 

and defining a fluid flow path between the first and 
second openings (13,14), the housing (11) including 

identical first and second body portions (23,24) joined 
to one another, and a filter arrangement (12) disposed 

within the housing in the fluid flow path and including 
a filter element (36) having a first surface (42) 

communicating with the first opening (13) and a second 
surface (43) communicating with the second opening (14), 

the filter arrangement (12) being secured within the 
housing (11) solely by mechanical compression between 

the first and second body portions (23,24), and a 
plurality of ribs (32) provided within each body portion 

(23,24), the ribs (32) of the second body portion (24) 
engaging an exterior of the filter element (36) to 

center the filter element (36) within the housing (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein the housing 
(11) includes a first end (15) having the first opening 

(13) and a second end (16) having the second opening 
(14), and wherein each body portion (23,24) includes one 

end of the housing (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein each body 
portion (23,24) further includes a seal edge (25,26) 

projecting inwardly from the end of the housing (11) and 
encircling the openings (13,14), the seal edge (25,26) 

of at least one body portion (23,24) protruding into the 
filter element (36) through an end surface (40,41) 

between the first surface (42) and the second surface 
(41), thereby forming a seal. 
Apparatus according to claim 3 wherein at least one 
rib (32) is disposed near each end of the housing (11), 

each rib (32) having first and second mutually 
perpendicular surfaces (33,34), the first surface (33) 

of the rib (32) of the second end (16) engaging the 
first surface (42) of the filter element (36) for 

centering the filter element (36) within the housing 
(11). 
Apparatus according to claim 4 including a blind end 
cap (45) disposed within the first portion (23), wherein 

at least one rib (32) located in the first portion (23) 
includes a third surface (35), generally perpendicular 

to the second surface (34), the end cap being centered 
by the third surface (35). 
Apparatus according to claim 4 wherein second 
surface (34) of at least one rib (32) fixes the axial 

position of a blind end cap (45) within the housing (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the housing 
(11) is substantially cylindrical and the first and 

second body portions (23,24) being joined to one another
