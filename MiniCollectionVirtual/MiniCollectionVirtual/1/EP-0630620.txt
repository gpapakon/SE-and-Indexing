Dental turbine drive containing a rotor disc 
(3) that is guided in bearings (4) and which, on its 

circumference, has a plurality of turbine blades to 
which compressed air can be applied according to the 

known free-jet principle by way of a nozzle (16), and 
containing a means of adjustment, which is arranged in 

the flow path of the exhaust air, for the control of 
the turbine speed, characterised in that the means of 

adjustment (11, 15) is arranged in the outflow channel 
(8) between the rotor disc (3) and the rotor disc 

housing (14) on the rotating portion of the rotor disc 
(3), with the cross section of the outflow channel (8) 

being restricted by the means of adjustment (11, 15) 
and an annular housing wall (14) and with the means of 

adjustment (11, 15) being formed in such a way that it 
changes its shape and/or position, when the rotor disc 

rotates, in consequence of centrifugal force in such a 
way that the effective cross section of the outflow 

channel (8) decreases with rising speed and increases 
with falling speed. 
Turbine drive according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the means of adjustment (11, 15) 

is arranged in a recess (10) on the face of the rotor 
disc (3). 
Turbine drive according to claim 1, 
characterised in that provided as a means of adjustment 

there is a resilient disc (11) that is formed in a cup-shaped 
manner and which is arranged with its angled 

edge (13) facing the rotor disc (3) in the recess (10) 
of the rotor disc (3). 
Turbine drive according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the resilient disc (11) forms 

spring-elastic segments by means of a plurality of 
slots (12). 
Turbine drive according to claim 4,  
 

characterised in that the slots (12) are arranged in 
the shape of a star. 
Turbine drive according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that provided as a means of adjustment 

there is an elastically deformable ring (O-ring 15) 
that is arranged so as to be concentric to the axis of 

the rotor disc (3) in the recess (10) and the outer 
face of which together with a housing wall (14) 

restricts the outflow cross section, with the selected 
elasticity of the ring being such that its shape and/or 

position in the recess (10) can be changed as a result 
of the centrifugal force for the purposes of varying 

the flow cross sections. 
Turbine drive according to one of the claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the outflow channel (8) 

runs into an exhaust air channel (9) which is arranged 
outside the turbine chamber which is delimited by the 

rotor disc (3) and the rotor disc housing.
