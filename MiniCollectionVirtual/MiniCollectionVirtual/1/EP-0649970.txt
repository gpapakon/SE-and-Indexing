<ABSTRACT>
A window or door frame (5) has a horizontal transom (4) above a 
glazing panel (3). An fan (2) or 

ventilation grille is mounted in an opening (6) in the frame 
above the transom (4). The opening (6) 

has a rebate (7) extending around its inner periphery. The fan (2) 
is held against one side of the 

rebate (7) and is clamped in position by a plate (21) held against 
the other side of the rebate (7) by 

screws (22) extending between the fan and the plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to assemblies of the kind having a dividing member and a glazing 
panel within the frame to one side of the dividing member. Window or door frames can include a vent unit such as a grille or a fan. This enables 
ventilation to take place with a fixed window or while the window or door is closed. One 
advantage of this is that it enables a high degree of security. It can also enable heat recovery 
apparatus to be used. Because a significant cost of an opening window frame is in its locking 
and opening mechanism, it can be cheaper to use a fixed window incorporating a fan or other 
vent. It is an object of the present invention to provide a window or door assembly in which 
an auxiliary unit, such as a ventilation unit, can be mounted readily. According to the present invention there is provided an assembly of the above-specified 
kind, characterised in that the other side of the dividing member defines an opening in which an 
auxiliary unit is received, that a rebate extends around the inner periphery of the opening, and 
that a member secures the auxiliary unit against an inside surface of the rebate. The member securing the auxiliary unit against the inside surface of the rebate may 
include a plate that bears against the outside of the rebate, the plate being secured to the 
auxiliary unit. The plate may be secured to the auxiliary unit by means of screws extending 
between the auxiliary unit and the plate. The dividing member is preferably a horizontally-extending 
transom, the glazing panel preferably being located below the transom and the 
auxiliary unit being located above the transom. The auxiliary unit may include an electric fan or 
be a ventilation grille.  Two different window assemblies, in accordance with the present invention, will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1is a side elevation view of an assembly from the inside; Figure 2is a sectional side elevation along the vertical line II - II of Figure 1; Figure 3is a sectional view along the horizontal line III - III 
of Figure 1; Figure 4is an exploded perspective view of the assembly; Figure 5is a side elevation view of a second assembly; Figure 6is a sectional side elevation along the vertical line VI - VI of 
Figure 5; Figure 7is a sectional view along the horizontal line VII - VII of 
Figure 5; and Figure 8is an exploded perspective view of the assembly of 
Figures 5 to 7. With reference first to Figures 1 to 4, there is shown an assembly
