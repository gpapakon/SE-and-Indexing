<ABSTRACT>
Liquid impinges on two sides (15, 17) of a plate (11) of piezoelectric material, for the liquid to be exposed to ultrasonic waves by the plate (11) oscillating at ultrasonic frequency. An electric voltage is uniformly applied to the two sides (15, 17) of the plate (11) at its peripheral edge via annular contact plates (27). The contact plates (27) have resilient fingers (31) bent towards the plate (11) for transferring the voltage on the one hand and for uniformly clamping the plate (11) on the other. To prevent the liqui from short-circuiting the plate (11), a seal (21) is located at the periphery of the plate (11) and is compressed for tightness between the plate (11), and intermediate ring (25) and the contact plates (27). An upper and a lower annular disc (19, 23) serve for better sealing and clamping of the plate (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a holder according to 
claim 1. The function of ultrasonic power converters is based on the 
reversal of the piezoelectric effect. By application of a 
voltage to the opposite sides (hereinafter referred to as 
upper and lower sides) of a plate of piezoelectric material, 
the plate is caused to ultrasonically oscillate. 
For this purpose, plates of piezoelectric material are provided 
with a complete electrically conductive coating, preferably 
a silver coating, on their upper and lower sides, 
with one wire each, connected to a voltage source, being 
soldered onto the same. The coating of the upper and lower 
sides of the plate is necessary, as the electric voltage 
would otherwise only be more or less punctually transferred 
to the piezoelectric material at the soldered joint. 
Contrary to this, with the coating the voltage is transferred 
onto the entire upper and/or lower side of the plate.  
 One known form of application of ultrasonic power converters 
is their use in quartz clocks. In addition, ultrasonic power converters form the essential 
part of medical sterilisation devices in which liquid is 
present on one side of the plate of piezoelectric material. 
With the application of a voltage to opposite sides of the 
plate the liquid is caused to oscillate. The quickness of 
the oscillating liquid produces cavitation zones which produce 
very high temperatures upon imploding. Germs or viruses 
in liquids are thereby killed. The applicants themselves use ultrasonic power converters 
according to DE 41 01 303 A1 
of PÃ¶schl et. al. for the high-pressure atomization of liquid fuel which was published on July 30, 1992 after the claimed priority date. In this 
connection the plate of piezoelectric material is fixed to 
an aperture in a wall. Fuel impinges on the opposite sides 
of the plate, i.e. on both sides, in order for the fuel to 
be foamed by means of the cavitation zones produced by the 
plate oscillating at ultrasonic frequency. Decisive for 
the function of the plate of piezoelectric material is that 
its upper and lower sides be in complete liquid-tight isolation 
from one another and that, furthermore, the upper 
and lower sides be electrically isolated from one another. 
Otherwise, liquid connecting the upper with the lower side 
would act as an electric bridge for the voltage applied 
between the upper and lower sides, which would cause a 
short circuit. To avoid this short circuit, according to the internal 
state of the art of the applicant, for a holder it has
