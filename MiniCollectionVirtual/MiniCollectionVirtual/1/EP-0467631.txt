<ABSTRACT>
A hybrid electrical optical connector is described 
employing a push-pull plug receptacle combination. A hood 

structure (22) protruding from the plug component (14) of 
the connector simultaneously serves to ensure that the plug 

(14) is properly rotationally oriented with respect to the 
receptacle (12) prior to insertion, that the individual 

terminals (20,18) are guided toward the respective terminal 
receiving channels (28,26), and that the plug (14) is 

latched in place once fully engaged. A rigid armature (46) 
allows the plug (14) to be partially assembled and tested 

prior to final overmolding. In its final overmolded form 
the plug (14) is impervious to the influx of contamination 

and can withstand a substantial amount of physical abuse. 
The inexpensive materials used in the constructio
n of the 
plug (14) and the ease of assembly yield a low cost plug 

(14) well suited for use in conjunction with a disposable 
peripheral device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to connectors and 
more particularly pertains to connectors for the 
simultaneous coupling of electrical and optical conduits. A multitude of devices are disclosed in the 
prior art that serve to interconnect electrical 
conductors as well as optic fibers in a single hybrid 
connector. Combining two such dissimilar interconnecting 
functions poses special problems as the requirements for 
making good electrical contact differ from what is 
involved in achieving a good optical coupling. For 
example, in order to achieve a good electrical 
interconnection, it is generally desirable that the 
contacting surfaces engage in a sweeping motion to clear 
away any contamination or oxidation that may have 
accumulated. Once engaged, substantial force is required 
in order to maintain electrical contact. The optical 
coupling of two light conducting fibers on the other hand  
 
requires extremely precise axial alignment of the 
respective fiber ends. A lateral offset of just a few 
microns or an angular misalignment of a few minutes of 
arc can significantly compromise the transmission of 
light energy. The connectors in which both the described 
requirements for the electrical connection and the 
precision required for the optical connection are 
simultaneously achieved typically result in devices that 
are rather large, complex, difficult to manufacture and 
expensive, especially when designed for use under harsh 
conditions. Additionally, such devices can be difficult 
to manipulate, a problem that is compounding when the 
connectors are used under adverse circumstances. The 
expense inherent in the prior art connectors is 
especially limiting when a connector is intended for use 
in conjunction with an expendable or disposable 
peripheral device. The present invention seeks to overcome the 
prior art's inherent disadvantages with the push-pull 
type electrical-optical hybrid connector described in 
detail herein below. More particularly, the invention 
provides a connector that is ideally suited for 
interconnecting an expendable or disposable peripheral 
device with permanent, expensive equipment and one that 
is additionally capable of surviving the conditions the  
 
peripheral device is typically subjected to. An example 
of an application for which the connector of the present 
invention is ideally suited is medical instrumentation 
which employs a single-use probe electrically and 
optically interconnected to analyzing equipment. 
Contamination concerns not only preclude the
