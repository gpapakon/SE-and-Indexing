<ABSTRACT>
A patching panel (4) for housing multiple connections in 
an optical communication system. The panel is 

corrugated to define alternately disposed angled faces 
and apertures are provided on alternate faces (6) on 

each side of a central line parallel to the corrugations 
so that the ends of terminal connectors mounted in the 

patch panel are angled away from the centre of the panel 
in a direction towards the nearest side of the panel. 

Preferably the angle progressively decreases towards the 
side. A flange extends from a frame supporting the 

patch panel on each side to prevent direct line of sight 
into a supported connector.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems and 
especially to patch panel arrays for optical 
communication systems. A patch panel is a housing for the connections between 
lines of a communication system, such as a connection 
between a main trunk line and a subscriber line. 
Currently optical communication patch panels have a 
vertical panel having a two dimensional array of 
apertures for receiving the terminations of one set of 
lines on to which connectors for the lines to be 
connected can be attached. These panels are housed in 
cabinets. There are two problems associated with this current 
arrangement. Firstly there is a limit to the density of 
the array that can be fitted on to the vertical panel 
and to the number of panels that can be located in a 
given cabinet. In exchanges having many lines, and 
especially in major cities where floor space is at a 
premium, it is desirable to minimise the space occupied 
by patch panels, or in other words it is desirable to 
increase the packing density of the connectors. The 
second problem that can arise is that when the 
connectors are disconnected it is possible to view 
directly into a potentially active line since, for 
reasons of access, the lines that are directly supported 
by the patch panel have their terminations inserted 
through the panel from the rear and face forwardly ready 
to receive a connector from the front. In normal 
operating circumstances it is unlikely that laser light 
signals emanating from an exposed line end would be 
harmful to the human eye when simply viewed with the 
naked eye, but if the light were viewed through or in  
 
conjunction with optical apparatus there may be a risk of 
damage. Known patch panels are described in EP-A-0293183, US-A-4673246 
and GB-A-2166262. EP-A-0293183 constitutes prior art in the 
meaning of Art. 54(3) EPC.  
 The aim of the invention is to provide a patch panel 
which may accommodate a greater density of connectors, and 
which inhibits direct viewing into disconnected line 
terminals. The present invention provides apparatus for housing 
connections between lines of an optical communications 
system, the apparatus comprising a patch panel for supporting 
a plurality of line connectors, the patch panel comprising a 
series of corrugations defining alternately oriented, plane faces, 
alternate faces on each side of a central axis of the patch 
panel, which axis runs parallel to the corrugations, being provided 
with apertures for receiving line 
connectors, characterised in that the

characterised in that the apertured faces (6) slope 
away from said central axis of the patch panel in a direction 

towards opposite edges of the patch panel. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, in which the 
individual corrugations are asymmetric. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which 
the plane faces have progressively shallower angles from 

said central axis towards the sides of the patch panel. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
further comprising a frame (1, 2, 3) for supporting the patch 

panel (4), the frame being provided with flange means 
extending from the sides of the frame for inhibiting direct 

line of sight into the connector openings. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
further comprising means for supporting fibres leading to the 

connectors.
