<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a simple synthetic method for complex
oligosaccharides. In general, it relates to a method of regio-and
stereoselective hydrolysis by catalytic antibodies. In particular, it relates to a
method of regio-and stereoselective hydrolysis to deprotect acylated
carbohydrates, including monosaccharides and oligosaccharides, in which
hydroxy groups are protected by the same acyl group. The invention
contributes not only to basic research for elucidation of biological function of
oligosaccharides but also development of useful oligosaccharide drugs.It is gradually becoming clear that (a) glicolipids on cell-surface
and oligosaccharides of glycoproteins alter through development of cells
and canceration of cells, (b) oligosaccharides of glycoproteins function as a
receptor of virus and toxin, and (c) oligosaccharides of glycoproteins are
associated with cell-cell interactions. According to the recognition of
biological importance of oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, a research of
chemical synthesis of them has become more intensive.In general, oligosaccharides are synthesized by sequential
glycosylation of monosaccharides. There are two major problems of
synthesizing the oligosaccharides. One is to control stereochemistry of
glycosylation. The other is to control linkage positions in the formed
oligosaccharides, which is very important, because there are many hydroxy
groups in oligosaccharides. It is necessary to differentiate a desired hydroxy
group for glycosylation. In synthesis of complex oligosaccharides, a desired 
hydroxy group in non-reducing end in extending oligosaccharides is
selectively deprotected and is subjected to glycosylation with an added
monosaccharide. To date, protected carbohydrates, in which the hydroxy
group used for the next glycosyl linkage is protected with ester, ether, ketal,
and carbonate that can be selectively removed, are synthesized and used fc
coupling with non-reducing end of oligosaccharides. However, syntheses of
such selectively protected carbohydrates require complicated combinations
of varieties of protecting groups for chemically competing hydroxy groups.
Thus, the synthesis procedure requires many steps consuming time and
effort.Recently, the methods for introducing catalytic activity into
antibodies have been developed (A. Tramontano, K. D. Janda, R. A. Lerner,
Science, 234, 1566 (1986)
and R.A. Lerner, S.J. Benkavic, P.G. Schultz, Science, 252, 659-667(1991)).
These catalytic antibodies are potential to be
useful bio-catalysts for selective
