<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for lining installed pipework comprises a support 
structure, a swaging die (3) disposed within the structure for 

reducing the diameter of a liner pipe passed through it, 
fixing means (2) for enabling the structure to be fixed to the 

pipe to be lined and means (8) for heating the die (3) so that 
the liner pipe is heated before it emerges from the die (3), 

the fixing means (2) being adapted to fix the structure at a 
spacing from the pipework (10), there being means (12) located 

within the spacing to cool the heated liner pipe as it emerges 
from the die (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the lining of existing
pipes. The invention will be described in relation to gas,
oil and water supply pipes, but it will be appreciated that
the invention is applicable to pipes of all kinds.When lining pipes (which pipes when ground embedded are prone
to crack due to ground movement) it is known to draw a heated
liner of plastic tube through a die to reduce the diameter and
then into a length of the existing pipe.The present invention relates to an improved apparatus for
lining installed pipework when using a swaging die to reduce
the diameter of the liner pipe prior to its being drawn into
the existing pipework. By "installed" pipework is meant
pipework that has already been installed in position to carry
out its intended purpose, such as for example, ground embedded
pipework for gas, oil water or sewage, pipework forming part
of a larger installation such as in oil or gas refinery or
storage installation, or pipework resting on the ground and
laid down to connect a source of supply to the recipient such
as an oil pipe connecting a well to a refinery or port.In the case of ground embedded pipework it will be appreciated
that the normal arrangement when such a process is being
carried out will involve a winch adjacent to an excavation at 
one end of a length of pipe to be lined, whence a cable or
similar flexible ligament passes through the length of pipe
to a second excavation beyond which it is attached to the
front end of a liner pipe of plastics material. Adjacent to
the second excavation is a tube heating and compressing
apparatus which has a heater and a size reduction die. At a
downstream end of this apparatus there may be a
reciprocatable "pusher" which can grip the pipe and draw it
from the apparatus and urge it towards the pipe to be lined.GB 807413 (Tubovit) relates to a process for the lining of
pipes of non-thermoplastic material with a liner of
synthetic thermoplastic resin, the process comprising the
steps of passing a synthetic resin liner having a mean outer
diameter greater than the inside diameter of the non-thermoplastic
pipe through a die having an inside diameter
less than the original mean outer diameter of the resin
liner and less than or substantially equal to the inner
diameter of the non-thermoplastic pipe, after having heated
said resin liner to a temperature at which the synthetic
resin undergoes deformations which may be temporarily set by
cooling but are substantially eliminated by subsequent heat
treatment, introducing the

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for lining installed pipework comprising a
support structure, a swaging die disposed within the

structure for reducing the diameter of a liner pipe
passed through it, fixing means for enabling the

structure to be fixed to the pipe to be lined, the
fixing means (2) being adapted to fix the structure at

a spacing from the pipework (10) there being means (12)
located within the spacing to cool the heated liner

pipe as it emerges from the die (3), characterised in
that means is provided for heating the die (3) so that

the liner pipe is heated before it emerges from the
die(3).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that
the die (3) has a hollow body in which there are

located the means (8) for heating the die (3).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterised in that
the heating means (8) comprises an electrical heating

coil (8) which in use is supplied with electricity by
way of an electrical supply circuit.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the swaging die is provided with

a swaging surface which, or part of which, is inclined
at an angle between 6 degrees and 32 degrees and no 

part at
an angle of more than 32 degrees to the die axis. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the angle of inclination of the

swaging surface is between 12 degrees and 29 degrees.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that
the angle of the swaging surface is between 20 degrees

and 25 degrees.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the inclined surface extends over

an axial length that represents a proportion of at least
70% of the overall axial distance between that part of

the swaging surface that has the maximum diameter and the
die outlet.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, characterised in that
the proportion is at least 80%.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that
the proportion is at least 85%.
Apparatus as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the walls of that part of the die

interior that extends between the said swaging surface
and the outlet are parallel to the die axis.
