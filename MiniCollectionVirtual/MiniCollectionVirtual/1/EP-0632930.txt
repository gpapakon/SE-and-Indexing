An image cell for an image-recorder chip having a
multiplicity of such image cells disposed in the form of a

two dimensional array and having a readout logic, which is
designed for forming a high input signal dynamic on a

reduced output signal dynamic, with the light-sensitive
element of the image cell (11..23) being in a

circuit between the one main electrode of a first MOS transistor
(M1) and the gate of a second MOS transistor (M2) and

being directly connected thereto respectively,
characterized by
a fixed potential (V
ss
) being applied to the gate of
said first MOS transistor (M1) by means of which the

compression of the input signal dynamic leads to an
output logarithmic line,
the other main electrode and said gate of said first
MOS transistor (M1) being short circuited,
said other main electrode of said first transistor (M1)
and the first main electrode of said second transistor

lying on a common potential (V
ss
), and
an output singal amplifier being connected to the
second electrode of said second MOS transistor (M2).
An image cell according to claim 1,
characterized by
 said one main electrode of said first MOS
transistor (M1) being the source electrode and the other

electrode the drain electrode.
An image cell according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized by
 said light-sensitive element being said
one main electrode of said first MOS transistor (M1). 
An image cell according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
characterized by
 said second main electrode of said second
MOS transistor being the source electrode.
An image cell according to one of the claims 1 to 4,
characterized by
 said output signal amplifier being a two-stage
designed further amplifier (M3a, M4), the first

stage of which (M3a) takes a small quiescent current and
its second stage (M4) designed as a power stage (M4) only

becomes activated for reading out.
An image cell according to claim 4,
characterized by
 a MOS transistors (M3) serving as a
load for said second MOS transistor.
