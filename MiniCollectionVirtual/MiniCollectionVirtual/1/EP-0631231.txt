<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for using a scroll bar (32) to select and 
view exact pages of a document without downloading unwanted pages 

of the document. Instead of displaying all the pages before a particular 
page is selected via scroll bar (32), the method does not display any of 

the incremental or unwanted pages before the actual selected page is 
selected, retrieved and displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application has been filed in the United States of America 
as patent application number 08/075,980 on June 14, 1993. This invention relates generally to user interface methods for 
computer systems and, in particular, to a method for selecting an exact 
page of information by using a scroll bar. Some conventional user interface methods provide a scroll bar 
for scrolling through pages of a document. For example, Microsoft 
Word is a word processing software program commercially available 
from Microsoft Corporation that use two scroll bars for scrolling 
through pages of a document. Typically in Microsoft Word, a vertical 
scroll bar is used to control movement or to scroll through lines and 
pages of a document, while a horizontal scroll bar controls movement 
through words in a line. Such conventional scroll bar systems usually comprise two 
arrows and a slider. Each arrow controls which direction a user wants 
to scroll through a document. An arrow conventionally controls 
movement through a document in small increments or small blocks of 
information, such as individual lines or a page of a document, for 
example. Moreover, if an arrow points in the upward direction, the 
document will be scrolled from its present position in the document 
toward the first page. If an arrow points in the downward direction, 
the document will be scrolled from its present position in a document 
toward the last page of the document. A slider is conventionally used to control movement through a 
document in larger increments than when the arrows are used. 
Instead of incrementing by small blocks of information, the slider 
typically controls movement through a document in larger blocks, 
increments or groups of information, such as two or more pages, for 
example. Therefore, when a user wants to go from the first page to the  
 
fiftieth page, the slider is usually selected and moved until page fifty is 
selected. One of the disadvantages of conventional scroll bar methods is 
that a page of information is always displayed after a user presses a 
mouse button to select one of the scrolling features (i.e., slider, arrows) 
and then releases the mouse button. Conventional scroll bar methods 
lack the capability of disabling or hindering the display of unwanted 
pages of information when a slider of a scroll bar is unable to obtain an 
exact page. Such a situation is critical when a user wants to view a 
large document comprising many pages of information, but the scroll 
bar region or space is inadequate to

<CLAIMS>
A method executed by a computer (10) as part of a computer 
program for displaying a page selected by a user from of a plurality of 

pages of a document, said computer comprising a display monitor (30) 
which displays a scroll bar (32), a button (40), a current page value and a 

total number of pages of said document, said method comprising the 
steps of: 


(a) selecting a current page value from said pages of said 
document by using a scroll bar (32); 
(b) displaying said current page value on said display monitor 
(30); 
(c) displaying on said display monitor (30) said page based on said 
current page value if said button (40) is active and selected by said user; 

and 
(d) displaying said page if said button (40) is inactive. 
A method as recited in claim 1, wherein said scroll bar (32) 
comprises a slider (34), a plurality of arrows (36, 38) and a scroll bar 

region (33), said scroll bar region comprising a plurality of pixels, and 
wherein step (a) comprises the steps of: 


(a1) waiting until said user selects said slider (34), one of said 
arrows (36, 38) or said scroll bar region (33); 
(a2) determining whether said user moved said slider (34) on 
said scroll bar (32); 
(a3) activating said button (40) if said pixels is greater than said 
total number of pages of said document; 
(a4) adjusting said current page value by one if said pixels is 
greater than said total number of pages of said document; and 
(a5) adjusting said current page value by a predetermined 
amount if said pixels is equal to or less than said total number of pages 

of said document. 
A method executed by a computer (10) as part of a computer 
program for displaying a page selected by a user from of a plurality of 

pages of a document, said computer comprising a display monitor (30) 
which displays a scroll bar (32), a button (40), a current page value and a 

total number of pages of said document, said computer (10) being 
connected to a main computer (14) across a network, said method 

comprising the steps of: 

(a) selecting a current page value from said pages of said 
document by using a scroll bar (32); 
(b) displaying said current page value on said display monitor 
(30); 
(c) retrieving said page based on said current page value from 
said main computer (14) if said button (40) is active and selected by said 

user or if said button (40) is inactive; 
(d) displaying on said display monitor (30) said page based on 
said current page value if said button (40) is active and selected by said 

user; and 
(e) displaying said page if said button (40) is inactive. 
A method as recited in claim 3, wherein said scroll bar (32) 

comprises a slider (34), a plurality of arrows (36, 38) and a scroll bar 
region (33), said scroll bar region (33) comprising a plurality of pixels, 

and wherein step (a) comprises the steps of: 

(a1) waiting until said user selects said slider (34), one of said 
arrows (36, 38) or said scroll bar region (33). 
(a2) determining whether said user moved said slider (34) on 
said scroll bar (32); 
(a3) activating said button (40) if said pixels is greater than said 
total number of pages of said document; 
(a4) adjusting said current page value by one if said pixels is 
greater than said total number of pages of said document; and 
(a5) adjusting said current page value by a predetermined 
amount if said pixels is equal to or less than said total number of pages 

of said document.
