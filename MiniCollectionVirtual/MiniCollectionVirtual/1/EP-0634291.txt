<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dye-donor elements for use 
according to thermal dye sublimation transfer and in particular to a 
heat-resistant layer of said dye-donor elements. Thermal dye sublimation transfer also called thermal dye 
diffusion transfer is a recording method in which a dye-donor 
element provided with a dye layer containing sublimable dye having 
heat transferability is brought into contact with a receiver sheet 
and selectively, in accordance with a pattern information signal, is 
heated by means of a thermal printing head provided with a plurality 
of juxtaposed heat-generating elements or resistors, so that dye is 
transferred from the selectively heated regions of the dye-donor 
element to the receiver sheet and forms a pattern thereon, the shape 
and density of which is in accordance with the pattern and intensity 
of heat applied to the dye-donor element. A dye-donor element for use according to thermal dye sublimation 
transfer usually comprises a very thin support e.g. a polyester 
support, one side of which has been covered with a dye layer 
comprising the printing dyes. Usually, an adhesive or subbing layer 
is provided between the support and the dye layer. Owing to the fact that the thin support softens when heated 
during the printing operation and then sticks to the thermal 
printing head, thereby causing malfunction of the printing apparatus 
and reduction in image quality, the back of the support (the side 
opposite to that carrying the dye layer) is typically provided with 
a heat-resistant layer to facilitate passage of the dye-donor 
element past the thermal printing head. An adhesive layer may be 
provided between the support and the heat-resistant layer. The heat-resistant layer generally comprises a lubricant and a 
binder. In the conventional heat-resistant layers the binder is 
either a cured binder as described in e.g. EP 153,880, EP 194,106, 
EP 314,348, EP 329,117, JP 60/151,096, JP 60/229,787, JP 60/229,792, 
JP 60/229,795, JP 62/48,589, JP 62/212,192, JP 62/259,889,  
 
JP 01/5884, JP 01/56,587, and JP 02/128,899 or a polymeric 
thermoplast as described in e.g. EP 267,469, JP 58/187,396, 
JP 63/191,678, JP 63/191,679, JP 01/234,292, and JP 02/70,485. During printing, a smooth transport of the donor ribbon and the 
dye-receiving element is required in order to obtain a good density 
uniformity all over the print. However, when white lines in a flat 
field of high density are printed parallel to the line of heater 
elements, the drum transport is hindered
