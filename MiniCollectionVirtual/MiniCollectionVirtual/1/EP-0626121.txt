<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OPTIMUM CHANNEL ASSIGNMENTTechnical FieldThis invention relates generally to communication systems, and more specifically to a method and system for optimum channel assignment.BackgroundA portable telephone system, such as a second-generation digital cordless telephone (CT-2) system, includes telepoint sites each having multiple transceivers. These transceivers allow persons using portable telephones (cordless telephone handsets) to access the public switched telephone network (PSTN) when in range of a telepoint. Each of the individual telepoint transceivers provide a particular channel of operation (at a different frequency) which can be used by a handset in order to communicate through the CT-2 system to the PSTN. CT-2 systems typically operate between 864.150 MHz and 868.050MHz, and can provide up to a theoretical maximum of 40 communication channels per telepoint (base-site), with each telepoint channel having 100 KHz channel spacing. The center frequency for the 40 channels can be calculated as: 864.050 MHz + (0.100 X n) MHz, where "n" is the channel number lying in the range of 1 to 40. In practice, since adjacent channels are not used due to selectivity constraints, a maximum of 20 channels is usually the practical limit. Most telepoint's usually having no more than 12-14 channels due to in-band interference and intermodulation problems in high density areas (e.g, a high-rise building or downtown area having many telepoints close to each other). As the number of channels in a telepoint increases, approaching the 20 channel practical maximum, the chances of not providing a good quality communication channel (communication link) increases tremendously due to greater chance for interference caused by adjacent channels, intermodulation, etc.SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 Presently, communication channels in a CT-2 system are assigned by determing which channels are available and assigning one of the available channels. The present, CT-2 channel assignment technique unfortunately does not provide telepoint users the best available (optimum) channel in terms of providing the communication channel having the least likelihood of being affected by interference or affecting other channels with interference(e.g, by adjacent or intermodulation channels, etc.).A need thus exists for a method of assigning communication channels in a multi-channel system which can provide for the optimum channel available at any given point in time from an interference standpoint. Such an assignment method would
