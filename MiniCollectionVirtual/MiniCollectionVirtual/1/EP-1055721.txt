<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal polymer composition, a highly heat-resistant
oriented film and a process for producing the oriented

film are disclosed. The liquid crystal polymer composition
contains a liquid crystal polymer producible through conventional

copolymerization and from which a large film can be easily and
efficiently produced by applying a solution thereof and a highly

heat-resistant film of the monodomain orientation type can be
formed by crosslinking the polymer in the film under practical

conditions. The highly heat-resistant oriented film is obtained
by orienting the liquid crystal polymer composition and

crosslinking the polymer. The liquid crystal polymer
composition comprises a side-chain type cholesteric liquid

crystal polymer having as repeating units a segment having an
unsaturated carbon ring as a crosslinkable side-chain terminal

group, a segment having an optically active group and a segment
imparting the property of undergoing nematic orientation; and a

low molecular weight crosslinking agent having one or more
(meth)acryloyl groups in the molecule.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal polymer
composition comprising a side-chain type cholesteric liquid
crystal polymer having at least one unsaturated carbon ring as
a crosslinkable side-chain terminal group and a low molecular
weight crosslinking agent having one or more (meth)acryloyl
groups. The present invention further relates to an oriented film
which is obtained by orienting the liquid crystal polymer
composition and then crosslinking the liquid crystal polymer, has
excellent heat resistance, and shows circular dichroism useful
in applications such as optical films. The present invention also
relates to a process for producing the oriented film.Various optical films comprising oriented films of a
cholesteric liquid crystal polymer have hitherto been proposed
and are expected to be used in applications such as liquid crystal
displays. However, these optical films have a problem that their
heat resistance, which depends on the glass transition
temperature of the cholesteric liquid crystal polymer, is poor
because they are formed by applying a solution of the liquid
crystal polymer on an alignment film, drying the solution, heating
the resultant coating film to a temperature not lower than the
glass transition temperature of the polymer to orient it, and then 
cooling the coating film.The reason for the poor heat resistance is as follows.
The oriented films comprising a cholesteric liquid crystal
polymer retain the Grandjean arrangement at temperatures not
higher than the temperature at which the polymer comes to have
an isotropic phase, when no stress is imposed thereon. Under a
stress, however, the arrangement of molecules is disordered at
around the glass transition temperature and, hence, the oriented
films suffer a change in optical properties. In actual use, it
is rather usual for oriented films to suffer a stress, for example,
as a result of a dimensional change due to a temperature change
under practical use conditions, as in the case where an oriented
film is bonded, for example, to a liquid crystal display through
a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer together with a polarizing
film, a retardation film or the like. For example, in the case
of an oriented film bonded to a polarizing film through a
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer, a shrinkage stress is imposed
thereon when the polarizing film undergoes a dimensional change
due to a temperature change.A possible measure for obtaining an oriented film having
improved heat resistance is to use a liquid crystal polymer having
a
