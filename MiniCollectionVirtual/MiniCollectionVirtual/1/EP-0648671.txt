<ABSTRACT>
The cabin air circulation system controls the fresh air flow rate, including the pressure and temperature monitoring, for the pressurised fuselage of a passenger aircraft and ensures that the conditioned air has a high purity level. It assists the weight-reducing factors in aircraft design by reducing the fuel and energy consumption in in-flight operation. The cabin air circulation system consists of a fresh air conditioning unit (8), an air mixer device (9) and an air-conditioned zone (10) which is arranged downstream of the latter; these are connected to one another in series in terms of the air flow. There is connection in terms of the air flow between the input of the fresh air conditioning unit (8) and an air flow control valve unit (11) arranged upstream of it. Fresh air is located at the input to the air flow control valve unit (11), preferably the air which is tapped off the engines. A trimming air control valve unit (12) is connected into the air flow-related connection between the air mixer device (9) and the air-conditioned zone (10), to whose input part of the fresh air which is fed to the air flow control valve unit (11) is applied. The air conditioned zone (10) is arranged downstream, in terms of the air flow, of a cabin recycling unit which supplies the input side of the air mixer unit (9) with conditioned recirculated air. This cabin recycling unit consists of a particle and/or fume filter unit (7), a fan unit (6), a carbon-dioxide absorber unit (5) and a heat-exchanger unit (4) through which the recirculated air, which is to be conditioned, flows in this sequence. This air is fed to the mixer device (9) and is circulated into the air-conditioned zone, mixed with the fresh air. The system is monitored by a cabin pressure regulating device (1), an air-conditioning system regulating device (2) and a cabin zone regulating device (3) to which control loops (13) are connected. These control loops are connected to the fresh air conditioning unit (8), the air mixer device (9), the air-conditioned zone (10) and the additional control valves (11, 12) such that suitable regulation of the fresh air, recycling air, pressure and temperature of the cabin air circulation system are achieved.
