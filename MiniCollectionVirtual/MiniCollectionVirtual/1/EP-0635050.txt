<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a novel method of inducing the
decarboxylation of malic acid to lactic acid in wine or fruit
juice by direct inoculation with a non-activated starter
culture of malolactically active lactic acid bacteria and a
composition comprising bacteria useful in the method.Grape juice, must and other fruit juice contain a varying
amount of L-malic acid and L-malate, the amount typically
being in the range of 1 to 10 g/L. The amount of malic acid
and malate depends largely on the climatic conditions prevailing
in the viticultural region. Hence, wines produced in
colder areas tend to have a relatively higher acid content,
since the malic acid is not degraded during the normal alcoholic
fermentation. From a taste and flavour point of view,
malic acid is considered undesirable in most red wines and in
several types of rose wines, white wines or sparkling wines.However, the content of malic acid and malate in a wine may
be reduced by a so-called malolactic fermentation (MLF) of
the wine which fermentation results from the metabolic activity
of various lactic acid bacteria, including species
belonging to the genera of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and
Leuconostoc. Such bacteria may be present in must and wine as
part of the indigenous microbial flora hereof, or they may
have been added as a bacterial starter culture. Typically,
the MLF is associated with malolactic bacterial growth and
catabolic processes during which the wine acidity is reduced.
The catabolic phase is usually entered when the malolactically
active bacteria during the growth phase has reached a
population density of about 106 colony forming units (CFU) 
per mL. The microbial malolactic deacidification results from
the decarboxylation of the dicarboxylic acid, L-malic acid to
the monocarboxylic acid, L-lactic acid. As a result of this
malolactic fermentation, the acidity of the wine decreases
and the pH increases, resulting in a wine with a softer
palate relative to that of the wine before the malolactic
fermentation. Following a successful malolactic fermentation
in wine, no further microbial growth will normally occur and
hence, the wine is considered to be microbiologically stable.The malolactic fermentation may occur spontaneously in the
wine as a result of the growth of an indigenous flora of
malolactically active lactic acid bacteria originating from
the vines and grape skins and also often surviving from one
season to the next on winery equipment, especially wooden
casks or other equipment made of wood. When occurring
