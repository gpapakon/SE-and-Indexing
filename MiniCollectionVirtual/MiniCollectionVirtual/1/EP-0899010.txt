<ABSTRACT>
The carrier strip (10) is made of inert, but gas and steam permeable, fiber cloth. Catalytic granules, whose cross-section is less than 1 mm, are spread over a water-wetted area (11). The whole of the strip is then wetted and wound in at least two layers around a tube (2) so that the catalytic material is sandwiched between two layers of the carrier.
