<ABSTRACT>
A gate turn-off thyristor including: an n-type 
emitter semiconductor layer (13) divided into a 

plurality of n-type areas; a p-type base semiconductor 
layer (14) which cooperates with the n-type emitter 

semiconductor layer to form a first main circular 
surface (11); an n-type base semiconductor layer (15); 

and a p-type emitter semiconductor layer (16) cooperating 
with the n-type base semiconductor layer to form a 

second main circular surface (12). A 
first main electrode (2) put in low resistance contact 

with the n-type emitter semiconductor layer is formed 
on the first main surface. A second main electrode (3) 

put in low resistance contact with the p-type emitter 
layer and the n-type base semiconductor layer is formed 

on the second main surface. A control electrode (4) is 
formed in the p-type base semiconductor on the first 

main surface. An outer diameter 
of the p-type emitter semiconductor layer (r
PE
) is smaller 
than that of the n-type emitter semiconductor layer (r
NE
). 
This reduces the current in the peripheral region and ensures a higher 

switching speed as the peripheral thyristor region is not overheated. 
Other ways of reducing the current in the peripheral region include 

introduction of lifetime killers or lowering the doping of the p-type 
emitter layer (16) in the peripheral region.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gate turn-off 
thyristors (hereinafter referred to as GTO 
thyristors) and more particularly to a GTO thyristor 
suitable for a high speed operation. A GTO thyristor switched (turned on/off) in 
accordance with a gating signal includes a semiconductor 
substrate in which, in turn, includes a pair of 
main opposite circular surfaces, four continuous pnpn-layers 
disposed between the main opposite surfaces with 
an outer n-(emitter) layer and an intermediate p-(base) 
layer being exposed on one of the main surfaces and 
with a p-(emitter) layer and an intermediate n-(base) 
layer being exposed on the other main surface, the n-emitter 
layer being divided into many strip-like areas 
disposed radially in a multi-concentric manner while 
the p-emitter layer is divided into many areas such 
that when the n-emitter layer is projected onto the 
main other surface, the areas of the p-emitter layer 
overlap with the strip-like area of the n-emitter 
layer; main electrodes on the cathode side put in low 
resistance contact with the respective areas of the n-emitter 
layer on the one main surface of the semiconductor 
substrate; a main electrode on the anode side 
put in low resistance contact with the p-emitter and n-base  
 
layers on the other main surface of the semiconductor 
substrate; control electrodes put in low resistance 
contact with the p-base layer on the one main 
surface of the semiconductor substrate so as to surround 
the respective areas of the n-emitter; a cathode 
side electrode plate connected electrically with the 
cathode side main electrodes and having a diameter 
smaller than the semiconductor substrate and larger 
than the n-emitter layer; an anode side electrode plate 
connected electrically with the anode side main electrode 
and having a diameter smaller than the substrate 
and larger than the p-emitter layer; and a control 
electrode lead connected electrically with the control 
electrode at substantially center of the one main 
surface of the semiconductor substrate (Refer to JP-A-63-15464 
(JP-B-6-1831)). The GTO thyristor is enclosed 
within a package which includes a pair of block-like 
external electrodes and a cylindrical insulating ring 
which connects the external electrodes with each other 
and supported between the external electrodes such that 
it is pressed by those external electrodes. The block-like 
external electrodes are smaller in diameter than 
the respective electrode plates so as to avoid stress 
concentration on the semiconductor
