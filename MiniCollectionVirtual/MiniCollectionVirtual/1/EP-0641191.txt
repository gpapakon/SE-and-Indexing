<ABSTRACT>
The compatibility of silicas with therapeutic agents in oral care compositions is improved by dehydroxylating the silica by a) thermal treatment and/or b) chemical reaction with a dehydroxylation agent selected from the group consisting of alcohols, silanes, and organosilanes. The invention provides especially beneficial improvement in compatibility between silica and non-fluoride therapeutic agents used in dentifrice and other oral care compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ORAL CARE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SILICA BASED MATERIALS WITH IMPROVED COMPATIBILITYBackground of the InventionCommercial oral care compositions, such as dentifrices, lozenges, chewing gums, etc., generally contain a variety of constituents. These constituents (such as therapeutic agents, carrier fluids, humectants, abrasives, thickeners, flavorings, fragrances, etc.) are typically selected based on various criteria such as cost, efficacy and compatibility.Compatibility refers to the interaction between the various constituents when they are put together into a single composition. Compatibility is concerned with how any interaction between the various constituents may affect the efficacy of the individual constituents. While there may be situations where the efficacy of constituents is enhanced by combination in' a single composition, the goal often is to find combinations of constituents which have a minimum adverse interaction. Since the performance of the therapeutic agent(s) is generally most important for the overall performance of the dentifrice composition, the other constituents are often chosen based on their compatibility with the therapeutic agent(s) to be used.A wide variety of therapeutic agents for oral care compositions have been developed over the years. Fluoride-based agents are most widely known and used for their proven anti-caries effects, however there are numerous other therapeutic agents which have been developed to address other oral care objectives such as fighting calculus, plaque, bacteria, etc. U.S. Patent 5,015,467 (Smitherman) gives a good review and discussion of therapeutic agents for oral care. Examples of non- 

fluoride agents include pyridinium salts such as cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) , guanidines such as chlorhexadine, triclosan, sanguinaria, zinc salts, copper salts, etc. Silica particles have been widely used in oral care compositions as abrasives and/or thickeners, silica particles are generally porous, amorphous silicas having fine particle size. Typical silica particles have surface areas of about 50-800 m2/g. Silica particles used as abrasives generally have pore volumes of about 0.3-1.0 cc/g whereas silica particles used as thickeners may have pore higher pore volumes up to or greater than 1.5 cc/g. Conventional silicas generally have surface hydroxyl groups which are bonded to silicon atoms on the silica surface as SiOH (silanol) groups. Silicas used in dentifrice compositions generally have about 4-8 SiOH groups per nanometer squared.Silica particles
