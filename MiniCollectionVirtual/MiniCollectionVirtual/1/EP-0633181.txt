<ABSTRACT>
Steering system for a motor vehicle, of the type acting through a difference in speed between the left-hand and right-hand wheels, and comprising a differential (24) with three parallel sets of gears (32, 34, 36), an input shaft (22) of which, driven by the motive means (10, 12) of the vehicle, is integral with the spider (54) of the first and second sets (32, 34), the outer crown wheels of these two sets driving the two output shafts (26, 28) of the differential, brakes (44, 72) being provided on a shaft (40) carrying the planet pinions (spider gears) of the three sets of gears and on a shaft (68) integral with the outer crown wheel of the third set of gears. The invention especially improves the compactness and robustness of differentials used in these steering systems.

A steering system for an automotive vehicle, of 
the type which acts through the difference in speed 

between the left side wheels and the right side wheels of 
the vehicle and which comprises a controlled differential 

gear (24) incorporating an input shaft (22) driven by the 
driving means (10, 12) to propel the vehicle and two 

output shafts (26, 28) which are respectively connected to 
the left side wheels and the right side wheels of the 

vehicle, as well as left side and right side brakes (44, 
72) which act indirectly on the rotation of the 

aforementioned output shafts, characterised in that this 
differential gear (24) comprises three parallel 

differential change planet gears (32, 34, 36) each 
comprising a planet wheel (38), drive pinion wheels and an 

outer ring gear, the planet wheels (38) of these three 
differential change gears being integral in rotation with 

one another and connected in a fixed position to a shaft 
(40) upon which one of the aforementioned brakes (44) 

act, the driving means (10, 12) to propel the vehicle 
being connected to the carrier pinions (54) of a first and 

second of these differential change gears whose outer ring 
gears (50, 58) are connected to the aforementioned output 

shafts (28, 26), the other brake (72) acting on a shaft 
(68) driven by the outer ring gear (66) of the third 

differential change gear (36). 
A system according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the first (32) of the afore-mentioned differential 

change gears is of the "Ravigneaux" type, comprising two 
series of meshed drive pinion wheels '46, 48), carried by 

a same carrier pinion (54) and placed between the planet 
wheel (38) and the outer ring gear (50) of this 

differential change gear. 
A system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the second and third differential 

change gears ((34, 36) are of the plane type, comprising a 
series of drive pinions (56, 64) placed between the planet  

 
wheel (38) and an outer ring gear (58, 66), the carrier 

pinion (60) of the second differential change gear (34) 
being integral in rotation with that of the first 

differential change gear (32), the carrier pinion (74) of 
the third differential change gear (36) being integral 

with the outer ring gear (58) of the second differential 
change gear (34). 
A system according to one of the above Claims, 
characterised in that the carrier pinion (54) of the first 

differential change gear (32) is connected to the driving 
propulsion means (10, 12) by a tubular shaft (22) inside 

which the shaft (40) connected to the planet wheel (38) of 
the three differential change gears extends. 
A system according to one of the above Claims, 
characterised in that it comprises means (80, 82) to 

uncouple the driving means (10, 12) from the carrier 
pinion (54) of the first two differential change gears and 

to connect them to the shaft (40) carrying the planet 
wheels (38), thus enabling the output shafts (26, 28) to 

be turned in opposite directions to one another. 
A system according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that it comprises means (84, 86) to immobilize the carrier 

pinions (54) of the first two differential change gears in 
rotation, thus enabling the vehicle to turn on the spot. 
A system according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the aforementioned means used to 

uncouple the carrier pinion (54) from the driving means 
(10, 12) and to immobilize it in rotation comprise 

couplings of the claw type.
