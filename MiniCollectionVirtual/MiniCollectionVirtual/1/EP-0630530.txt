<ABSTRACT>
A holdown key (40) is provided that holds a low profile connector housing (30) to a circuit board (16), which securely holds the key to the connector before installation in the circuit board, and which provides high retention in the circuit board with only moderate stress on the key material. The key has a pair of largely vertically extending legs (60, 62) with lower ends that merge and with upper ends that are free of each other but which have locations (80, 80a) that abut each other when the legs are deflected toward each other. When the key is installed in a slot (50) of the connector housing, the legs are preferably deflected partially towards each other so the gap (B) between the locations is less than initially, but is not zero. However, when the key is fully installed in the circuit board, the locations abut each other to close the gap (C) and provide large retention force in the circuit board. Each leg has upper and lower shoulders (100, 104) that abut upper and lower surfaces (102, 106) on the connector housing to retain the key in the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
Electrical connectors that mount on the surface of a circuit board, 
can each include a connector housing that lies on the circuit board, multiple 
contacts with tails that press against corresponding pads on the surface of the 
circuit board, and a pair of keys at opposite ends of the connector housing that 
project through holes in the circuit board to retain the connector housing to the 
board. The keys may include a pair of largely vertical legs that are pressed down 
into the circuit board holes and that have barbs that dig into the walls of the 
holes. As the legs are pressed into the hole, the legs are resiliently deflected 
toward each other to provide a large holding force at the barbs. The keys hold 
the connector in place prior to soldering, and serve to relieve pressure on the 
solder joints that join the contact tails and circuit board pads when the connector 
is unmated from another connector and forces are applied that tend to pull the 
connector off of the board. At present, a "standard" and widely used holdown key is formed of 
sheet metal and has a pair of legs whose upper ends merge and whose lower ends 
are free to deflect together. U.S Patent 5,080,611 describes keys of this type. 
Such legs can apply only a moderate resistance to deflection, and therefore can 
apply only a moderate retention force. Keys have been proposed wherein both the 
upper and lower ends of the legs merge, resulting in high resistance to bending 
of the beams toward each other. U.S. Patent 4,907,987 describes keys of this type. 
Although merging the upper and lower ends of the keys makes the legs highly 
resistant to deflection toward each other, they can deflect only a moderate 
distance before plastic deformation begins. As a result, if there is poor matching 
of the key and circuit board hole, as where the hole is of maximum  
 
diameter and the distance between the key legs is minimum, 
this may result in only a very small or nonexistent 
retention force. Also, such keys can be difficult to stably 
mount in the connector so they remain stably in position 
prior to installation on a circuit board. A connector with 
holdown keys which could apply large retention forces in the 
most common cases, but which still applied moderate holdown 
force under "worst" case conditions, and which facilitated 
retention on the connector prior to mounting of the 
connector on a circuit board, would be of considerable 
value. In accordance with one embodiment of the present 
invention, an electrical connector is provided
