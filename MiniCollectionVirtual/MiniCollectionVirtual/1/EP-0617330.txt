<ABSTRACT>
A method for making a lithographic printing 
plate which comprises the steps of A) imagewise 

exposing a light sensitive material which comprises a 
support, a negative working silver halide emulsion 

layer and a surface physical development nucleating 
layer on said support, and B) processing the exposed 

material in a silver complex diffusion transfer 
developer containing a water soluble iodide to produce 

a non-black oleophilic silver image on the surface of 
said printing plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making 
a lithographic printing plate by the silver complex 
diffusion transfer process. In particular, this 
invention relates to a method of preventing image 
degradation of the printing plate due to deterioration 
of the processing chemistry. The present invention relates to a single 
sheet printing plate construction comprising a support, 
on which an antihalation layer, an emulsion layer and a 
physical nucleating receptor layer are provided. 
Following imagewise exposure, the plate is processed in 
a diffusion transfer developer. The exposed area 
develops out as a black silver image, while the 
unexposed silver halide subsequently diffuses through 
to the receptor element. Physical development nuclei 
in the receptor layer reduce the silver halide to a 
metallic silver complex in the presence of the toning 
agent 1 -phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazole. As described in various embodiments, e.g., 
U.S. 3,728,114, U.S. 4,160,670 and U.S. 4,361,635, such 
a process can function as a lithographic printing plate 
due to the oleophilic nature of the complexed silver in 
the receptor layer and the hydrophilic developed silver 
image in the emulsion layer. However, a very rapid 
development process is required to reduce exposed areas 
into non-diffusing silver images before the silver 
halide solvent can take effect. The greater the 
differentiation between the (unexposed) complexed  
 
silver and the (exposed) developed image area, the 
better the printing quality will be. According to James, TheTheoryofThePhotographic Process, 4th. Edition, Macmillan 
Publishing Co., New York, 1979, page 475, several 
factors such as silver concentration, particle size and 
physical development nuclei can affect the color of the 
transferred silver. Diffusion transfer systems such as 
monochrome prints, duplicating papers, block copying 
materials and instant photography require a neutral 
black, or at least a blue-black, tone. In this respect 
iodide is well documented as a toning agent or 
restrainer. U.S. 3,515,555 describes a direct positive 
photographic paper with improved tone when processed in 
a solution containing an alkali metal sulfide, alkali 
metal hydroxide, thioamide and an alkali metal iodide. U.S. 3,619,186 describes a diffusion transfer 
system wherein the receiving layer contains iodide. 
This results in a neutral tone image. The presence of 
iodide in the emulsion layer or developer does not have 
the same beneficial effect on tone. U.S. 4,124,390 discloses a mordanting
