<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to developer materials for use in 
electrostatographic imaging systems. More specifically this 
invention relates to a two component, dry electrostatographic 
developer composition comprising electrostatographic toner particles 
and carrier particles. It is well known in the art of electrographic printing and 
electrophotographic copying to form an electrostatic latent image 
corresponding to either the original to be copied, or corresponding 
to digitized data describing an electronically available image. In electrophotography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
the steps of uniformly charging a photoconductive member and 
imagewise discharging it by an imagewise modulated photo-exposure. In electrography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
imagewise depositing electrically charged particles, e.g. from 
electron beam or ionized gas onto a dielectric substrate. The obtained latent images are developed, i.e. converted into 
visible images by selectively depositing thereon light absorbing 
particles, called toner particles, which usually are 
triboelectrically charged. In toner development of latent electrostatic images two 
techniques have been applied : "dry" powder and "liquid" dispersion 
development of which dry powder development is nowadays most 
frequently used. In dry development the application of dry toner powder to the 
substrate carrying the latent electrostatic image may be carried out 
by different methods known as, "cascade", "magnetic brush", "powder 
cloud", "impression" or "transfer" development also known as 
"touchdown" development described e.g. by Thomas L. Thourson in IEEE 
Transactions on Electronic Devices, Vol. ED-19, No. 4, April 1972, 
pp.495-511. In most cases the latent image is developed with a finely  
 
divided developing material or toner to form a powder image which is 
then transferred onto a support sheet such as paper. The transferred image may subsequently be permanently affixed to 
the substrate by heat, pressure, or a combination of heat and 
pressure. Electrophotographic processes can not only be employed to form 
monochrome (black) images, but also to form colour images. It is 
known to form full colour images by sequentially forming and 
developing electrostatic colour sparation images with cyan, magenta, 
yellow and black toners respectively. In such applications high 
quality toners are needed. By 'quality' in electrostatography is generally understood a 
true, faithful reproduction of the original to be copied, or 
faith
