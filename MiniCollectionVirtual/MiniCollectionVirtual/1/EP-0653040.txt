<ABSTRACT>
The present dual fuel injector (12) reduces the formation of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides within the combustion zone by providing a series of premixing chambers (148, 188) being in serially aligned relationship one to another. During operation of the dual fuel injector (12) the premixing chambers (148, 188) have a liquid fluid and air or water and air being further mixed with additional air or a gaseous fluid and air. The liquid fluid and the gaseous fluid can be used simultaneously or individually depending on the availability of fluids.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a low 
emission combustion nozzle. More particularly, the 
invention relates to a dual fuel premix combustor 
injector nozzle for reducing emissions. The use of fossil fuel as the combustible 
fuel in gas turbine engines results in the combustion 
products of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water 
vapor, smoke and particulates, unburned hydrocarbons, 
nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. Of these above 
products, carbon dioxide and water vapor are 
considered normal and unobjectionable. In most 
applications, governmental imposed regulation are 
further restricting the amount of pollutants being 
emitted in the exhaust gases. In the past, the majority of the products of 
combustion have been controlled by design 
modifications. For example, at the present time smoke 
has normally been controlled by design modifications 
in the combustor, particulates are normally controlled 
by traps and filters, and sulfur oxides are normally 
controlled by the selection of fuels being low in 
total sulfur. This leaves carbon monoxide, unburned 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides as the emissions of 
primary concern in the exhaust gases being emitted 
from the gas turbine engine. Oxides of nitrogen are produced in two ways 
in conventional combustion systems. For example,  
 
oxides of nitrogen are formed at high temperature 
within the combustion zone by the direct combination 
of atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen and by the presence 
of organic nitrogen in the fuel. The rates with which 
nitrogen oxides form depend upon the flame temperature 
and, consequently, a small reduction in flame 
temperature can result in a large reduction in the 
nitrogen oxides. Past and some present systems providing 
means for reducing the maximum temperature in the 
combustion zone of a gas turbine combustor have 
included water injection. An injector nozzle used 
with a water injection system is disclosed in 
US-A-4,600,151. 
The injector nozzle disclosed 
includes an annular shroud means operatively 
associated with a plurality of sleeve means, one 
inside the other in spaced apart relation. The sleeve 
means form a liquid fuel-receiving chamber and a water 
or auxiliary fuel-receiving chamber positioned inside 
the liquid fuel-receiving chamber. The fuel-receiving 
chamber is used to discharge water or auxiliary fuel, 
or in addition, an alternatively to the liquid fuel. 
The sleeve means further forms an inner air-receiving 
chamber for receiving and directing compressor 
discharged air into the fuel
