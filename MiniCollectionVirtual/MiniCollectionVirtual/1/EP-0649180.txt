<ABSTRACT>
In order to make it possible to tune the electrical length of the stripline at the highest possible rate, the outer conductor (1) and the inner conductor (2) of the ferrite-loaded stripline are divided by one or more slits (7, 8), extending in the wave propagation direction, into at least two stripline sections, so that a variable current injected via one of the stripline sections and fed back via another stripline section generates a changing premagnetisation field inside the stripline.

<CLAIMS>
Strip conductor, the electrical length of which is tunable with the aid of a variable
premagnetisation field, which acts on ferrite, with which a strip-shaped inner conductor

and/or an outer conductor surrounding this is at least partly covered, characterised thereby
that the outer conductor (1) and inner conductor (2) are divided up into at least two strip

conductor portions by one or more slots (8) extending in wave propagation direction, so
that a variable current fed by way of one of the strip conductor portions and returned by

another strip conductor portion generates a varying premagnetisation field in the interior of
the strip conductor.
Strip conductor according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the variable current
is coupled by way of a transformer (9) to the outer conductor (1) and inner conductor (2) of

the strip conductor portions.
Strip conductor according to claim 1, characterised thereby that it is surrounded by
an electromagnet (12...17), which generates a premagnetisation field which penetrates

from the outside into the interior of the strip conductor and the rate of change of which is
lower than that of the premagnetisation field which is caused by a current flowing through

the outer conductor (1) and inner conductor (2).
Strip conductor according to claims 1 and 3, characterised thereby that the low-frequency
current for the electromagnet (12...17) producing the premagnetisation field with

the lower rate of change is separated by high-pass and low-pass filtering from the high-frequency
current causing the premagnetisation field with the higher rate of change.
Strip conductor according to claim 1, characterised thereby that a permanent
magnet (10, 11), which premagnetises the ferrite (3) in the strip conductor (1, 2) until

saturated, is present.
