<ABSTRACT>
The tearing of tissues during dispensing from upright tissue 
cartons is reduced by providing the carton with a plastic film (6) having 

a dispensing opening with an effective open area of about 3 square 
inches or greater. Dispensing openings formed by multiple 

intersecting slits (17, 18) provide improved dispensing while retaining an 
aesthetic pop-up presentation and protection of the tissues within 

the carton.

<DESCRIPTION>
Facial tissue cartons come in a wide variety of shapes and
sizes, but they can generally be classified as either one of two
basic styles. One style is the flat carton and the other is the
upright carton. In the flat cartons, the tissues are laid flat in
the bottom of the carton and are withdrawn from the top of the carton
or through an opening in the top which partially extends down the
front sidewall. The tissues within the carton may be interfolded for
pop-up dispensing or merely laid on top of each other for reach-in
dispensing. In the upright cartons, the tissues are folded into an
inverted u-shaped clip and are interfolded for pop-up dispensing.
The tissues are withdrawn through a dispensing opening in the top of
the carton, which may contain a poly film having a slit to hold the
popped up tissue in place.The dispensing problems associated with flat cartons and upright
cartons are distinctly different. With flat cartons, the major
dispensing concern is usually "fallback", which occurs as the tissue
clip within the carton gets low and the distance from the uppermost
tissue to the opening in the top of the carton gets longer. This can
cause the tissue to fall back into the box rather than being retained
by the opening for ready removal. On the other hand, fallback is not
a problem for upright cartons because the inverted u-shaped clip
maintains all of the tissues within the clip in close proximity to
the top opening at all times. However, tearing of the tissue sheets
upon removal from the carton is a concern because of the frictional
forces and pressures associated with the inverted u-shaped clip being
pressed up against the walls of the carton and the intra-tissue
contact. These resistive forces can cause the tissues to tear as
they are pulled through the dispensing opening. This is particularly
true for the first few sheets dispensed after the carton is opened.
The problem is lessened as the tissues within the carton are used up
and the compression of the clip is reduced. It has now been discovered that the occurrence of sheet
tears upon removal from upright tissue dispensing cartons can
be greatly reduced by appropriately modifying the dispensing
opening of an upright tissue carton containing a u-shaped
clip of interfolded tissues, said carton having a top wall,
four side walls and a bottom wall, said top wall having a
carton opening overlaid with a flexible plastic film attached
thereto, said plastic film having a dispensing opening
through which the tissues are withdrawn from the carton. Such
