<ABSTRACT>
A disposable body warmer (W) comprising a flat inner bag (1), heat-generating 
component (2) which generates heat under presence of air being enclosed in 

the flat inner bag and an airtight bag (4) enclosing the flat inner bag 
therein, characterized in that the heat-generating component contains 

potassium chloride, water, water-holding material, activated carbon and iron 
powder. With the disposable body warmer of the present invention, time 

required to reach a predetermined temperature from just after beginning of 
exothermic reaction is short, and duration in the predetermined temperature 

is long.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disposable 
body warmer, and more particularly to a disposable body 
warmer which has a good rising (i.e. the rising in 
temperature is fast) and can maintain a predetermined high 
temperature condition for a long time. A disposable body warmer is based on the fact if 
air is supplied to a mixture comprising metal powder 
available with relatively low cost such as iron powder and 
assistance such as water, wood flour and sodium chloride 
contained in an air-permeable bag, it generates heat. The 
disposable body warmer is easy to carry and can be easily 
used by merely openning an outer bag, so that it occupies 
a major proportion of body warmers in these days. In such disposable body warmers, sodium chloride 
has generally been used as a catalyst to promote 
exothermic reaction. However, the body warmer with sodium 
chloride as a catalyst does not always bring satisfaction 
with regard to rising rate in temperature, duration and 
warmness, because sodium chloride is unevenly oxydized. In view of the above-mentioned circumstance, it 
is an object of the present invention to provide a 
disposable body warmer with which the conventional problem 
is solved. That is, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a disposable body warmer with which 
time required to reach a predetermined temperature from 
just after beginning of exothermic reaction is short, and 
duration in the predetermined temperature is long. In a disposable body warmer of the present 
invention, heat-generating component is enclosed in a flat 
bag, the component being oxidized and generating heat 
under presence of air, and this flat bag is enclosed in an 
airtight bag. The disposable body warmer is characterized 
in that the heat-generating component contains potassium  
 
chloride, water, water-holding material, activated carbon 
and iron powder. Proportion of potassium chloride is preferably 
0.5 % to 10 % (% by weight, hereinafter the same), and 
more preferably 1.5 % to 5.0 %. Proportion of water is 
preferably 10 % to 35 %, and more preferably 25 % to 30 %. Preferably the heat-generating component further 
contains at least one member selected from the group 
consisting of iron sulfide, soda thiosulfate and potassium 
thiosulfate. Further, one surface of the flat bag is 
preferably provided with self-adhesive layer wholly or 
partially. This adhesive layer is preferably formed in 
stripe.

embodiment of a disposable body warmer of the present
