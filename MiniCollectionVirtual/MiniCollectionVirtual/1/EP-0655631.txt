<ABSTRACT>
A color filter having shade portions and colored 
light-transmittable portions on a substrate, said color 

filter being characterized in that the light-transmittable 
portions are colored with ink dots, and a 

difference between a maximum value and a minimum value 
of light transmittance in a thickness direction in the 

light-transmittable portions is 20% or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a color filter
suitable for a color liquid crystal display which can
be used in a color television, a personal computer, a
"PACHINKO" game machine (a kind of ball-game machines)
and the like.
More specifically, it relates to a
method for manufacturing a color filter;
for liquid crystals manufactured by the
utilization of an ink jet recording technique.In recent years, there has been a tendency that
the demand of liquid crystal displays, particularly
color liquid crystal displays increases with the
development of personal computers, particularly
portable personal computers. However, for the further
spread of the displays, it is necessary to lower their
costs, and particularly with regard to the color filter
which largely occupies the cost of each display,
request for its cost reduction increases. In order to meet the required characteristics of
the color filter and to satisfy the above-mentioned
demand, various attempts have been heretofore made, but
any method which can meet all of the required
characteristics has not been established so far.Some methods for manufacturing the color filter
will be described below.A first method which has most often been used is a
dyeing method. This dyeing method comprises adding a
sensitizing material to an aqueous polymer material
which is a material to be dyed to sensitize the polymer
material, patterning the sensitized material on a glass
substrate by a photolithography process, and then
immersing the thus obtained pattern in a dyeing bath to
obtain a dyed pattern. This operation is repeated
three times to form the dyed layers of red(R), green(G)
and blue(B).A second method which has next most often been
used is a pigment dispersion method, which is now being
replaced with the above-mentioned dyeing method. This
pigment dispersion method comprises first forming, on a
substrate, a photosensitive resin layer in which a
pigment is dispersed, and then patterning the resin
layer to obtain a single-colored pattern. Next, this
process is repeated three times to form colored layers
having three colors of R, G and B.A third method is an electrodeposition method. 
This method comprises first patterning transparent
electrodes on a substrate, and then immersing it in an
electrodeposition coating solution containing a
pigment, a resin, an electrolyte and the like to
electrodeposit a first color. This process is repeated
three times to form colored layers of R, G and B, and
in the last step, these layers are calcined.As a

Method for manufacturing a color filter comprising a substrate having
opaque portions and colored light-transmittable portions,

which method comprises

providing a light-transmittable substrate with opaque portions,
forming an ink-receiving layer (3) on the substrate (1) and
ejecting ink droplets through orifices by an ink-jet system to apply a
coloring agent to said ink-receiving layer (3), thereby coloring the light-transmittable

portions of the substrate with ink dots, wherein
the coloring agent is applied onto the ink-receiving layer (3) such that the
ink-receiving layer becomes colored in an area wider than the light-transmittable

portions of the substrate,
characterized in that

said ink-receiving layer (3) forms a substantially planar coating, and
the area of the colored portions is at least 1.2 times or more of that one of

the light-transmittable portions.
The method according to claim 1, wherein

the area of the colored portions is 1.4 times or more of that one of the
light-transmittable portions. 
The method according to anyone of the preceding claims, wherein
a red, green or blue ink is used as the ink.
Method for fabricating a liquid crystal panel comprising manufacturing a color filter
according to the method as claimed in anyone of the

preceding claims, and comprising the steps of arranging
a second substrate at a position opposite to the substrate of the

color filter, and of enclosing a liquid crystal compound between the second
substrate and the substrate of the color filter.
