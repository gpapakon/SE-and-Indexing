<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to slip-type assemblies for gripping and
suspending objects, especially tubular goods such as drill pipe or production tubing.
Such an assembly comprises a plurality of circumferentially spaced slip bodies
surrounding the locus of the pipe or other object and which in turn are generally
surrounded by a generally outer body known as a "bowl." By means well known in
the art, the device can be initially emplaced about one section of pipe in a string.
The inner sides of the slip bodies carry gripping means, usually in the form of teeth
formed on hard metal dies, for biting into and frictionally engaging the pipe. The
outer sides of the slip bodies and/or the opposed inner side of the bowl may have
surfaces which are inclined radially inwardly and downwardly. Because the slip
bodies can move both longitudinally and radially with respect to the bowl, these
inclined surfaces serve as camming surfaces. Thus, when the weight of the pipe is
let down on the device, so that it tends to move the slip bodies downwardly with
respect to the bowl, the camming surfaces urge the slip bodies radially inwardly and
into tighter engagement with the pipe, so that the mechanism is self- tightening.In a typical well drilling operation, two such assemblies are typically
employed in, for example, pulling a string of drill pipe or other tubular goods from
the well. One such assembly, located at the rotary table, is typically referred to
simply as the "slips." The other, which is located above the slips and can travel
vertically up and down, is called the "elevator."If, for example, a string of pipe is being tripped from a well, e.g. to change
the drill bit, then with the elevator gripping one of the upper sections of drill pipe,
the slips in the rotary table can be released, and the elevator with the pipe carried
thereby can be raised farther above the rotary table. The slips in the rotary table can
then be engaged with the pipe, so that they support the pipe, and the elevator can be
released and moved downwardly to take another bite at a lower point on the drill
string. Of course, between the above steps, various sections of drill pipe can be
detached from the top of the string as they incrementally clear the elevator. In general principle, such devices have changed little since they first came into
use many years ago. One reason is that, being self-tightening by the very weight of
the objects they support, they are considered "fail safe." There are other advantages,
including the fact that the
