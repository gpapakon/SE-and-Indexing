<ABSTRACT>
A method for micro-machining the surface of 
a silicon substrate (10,14) which encompasses a 

minimal number of processing steps. The method 
involves a preferential etching process in which a 

chlorine plasma-etching is capable of laterally 
etching an N+ buried layer (12) beneath the surface of 

the bulk substrate (10,14). Such a method is 
particularly suitable for forming sensing devices 

which include a small micro-machined element (18), 
such as a 
bridge, cantilevered beam, membrane, 
suspended mass or capacitive element, which is 

supported over a cavity (22) formed in a bulk silicon 
substrate (10,14). The method also permits the 

formation of such sensing devices on the same 
substrate as their controlling integrated circuits. 

The method can optimise the dimensional 
characteristics of the micro-machined element (18) or 

encapsulate the micro-machined element (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
bulk micro-machining processes used to form integrated
circuit devices on or under the surface of a silicon
wafer. More particularly, this invention relates to
an improved method for micro-machining integrated
sensor devices on the surface of a silicon wafer which
incorporates bipolar and BiCMOS devices, wherein the
method encompasses the formation of bridges,
cantilevered beams, membranes, and suspended masses
within the surface of the silicon
wafer.Bulk micro-machining of silicon wafers is
well known in the semiconductor arts. Generally, this
process involves forming semiconductor devices on a
silicon wafer by etching the bulk silicon at the
surface of the wafer, in contrast to etching methods
in which semiconductor devices are formed by
selectively etching layers which were previously
deposited on the surface of the wafer substrate. Bulk
micro-machining can be used to form micro-machined
features in the surface of a silicon substrate from
which sensing devices can be formed, and is generally
preferred over etching deposited layers in the
fabrication of sensing devices in that less warpage
occurs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the sensing
device. Bulk micro-machining is often conducted using
a conventional wet-etch process, which is isotropic in
nature. Dry-etching processes, such as
plasma-etching, are becoming more common because of
their capability for higher packing density as a
result of being anisotropic in nature.In the past, sensing devices have often been
fabricated by stacking silicon wafers on top of each 
other so as to form a cavity over which a sensing
micro-machined element, such as a beam, bridge or
membrane, can be formed with the upper wafer.
Alignment tolerances as well as sharp corners and
edges on the wafers create points of stress
concentration within the sensing device, which
interfere with the ability of the micro-machined
element to accurately detect the pressure or motion
for which the device is intended. Consequently, bulk
micro-machining methods are often preferred in that
the residual stresses and stress concentrators common
to stacked-wafer techniques can generally be avoided.A recent example of such a bulk
micro-machining method is disclosed by Zhang and
McDonald (Digest IEEE Int. Conf. on Solid State
Sensors and Actuators, pp. 520-523 (1991)), as
generally illustrated in Figures 1a to 1f. As
illustrated in Figures 1a to 1f of the accompanying
drawings, Zhang and McDonald disclose thermally
