<ABSTRACT>
A monitoring system comprises an inspection 
device(46) incorporated in a cigarette manufacturing 

machine(30) and a server computer(50) connected to the 
inspection device(46) by means of a communication 

line(48). The inspection device(46) includes a measuring 
circuit(90) for continuously calculating the 

fill of the cut tobacco in each of a given number of 
divisions of each cigarette in accordance with a 

detection signal(Sd) from a density sensor(76), an enrollment 
control section(104) for repeatedly storing 

calculation data from the measuring circuit(90) in a 
quantity corresponding to a predetermined number of 

cigarettes at a time, and a CPU(128) for computing 
average calculation data for each division of each 

cigarette in accordance with the stored calculation 
data. The server computer(50) originates quality data 

for the cigarettes in accordance with the average

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a monitor system
adapted for use in the control of the quantity of cut
tobacco in cigarettes during the manufacture of the
cigarettes; a system for monitoring of this kind is disclosed
i.g. in US-A-3 742 795.According to a cigarette manufacturing machine,
as is generally known, cut tobacco is first fed onto a
paper web traveling in one direction, and is then
wrapped in the web, whereupon a continuous cigarette
rod is formed. Thereafter, the formed cigarette rod
is cut into individual cigarettes with a predetermined
length.Since each cigarette has opposite cut ends, the
cut tobacco may possibly fall off from the cut ends.In order to prevent the cut tobacco from falling
off, the quantity of cut tobacco in the cut end portions
of each cigarette is made larger than that in
any other portion. Thus, the cigarette rod has high-density
portions with an increased cut tobacco fill
arranged at intervals equivalent to the length of each
cigarette, and is cut in the center of each high-density
portion to form individual cigarettes.The cigarette manufacturing machine is provided
with a pair of trimming disks for forming the high-density
portions in the cigarette rod to be prepared.
These trimming disks are arranged in rolling contact 
with each other right under an endless tobacco band,
and are rotated in opposite directions. As the
tobacco band travels, a layer of the cut tobacco
formed on the lower surface of the band is fed toward
the paper web, as is conventionally known.Pockets are arranged at regular intervals on the
peripheral edge portion of each trimming disk. While
the trimming disks are rotating, each pocket of one
disk and its corresponding pocket of the other disk
cyclically meet each other right under the tobacco
band.The primary function of the trimming disks is to
scrape off a surplus of the cut tobacco in the tobacco
layer on the tobacco band by rotating, thereby
adjusting the thickness of the cut tobacco layer on
the tobacco band, that is, the tobacco supply from the
tobacco band to the paper web.If the pockets are formed on the trimming disks
in the aforesaid manner, however, the thickness of the
cut tobacco layer increases in proportion to the
capacity of the pockets. Accordingly, the supply of
the cut tobacco fed onto the paper web increases
cyclically, so that the cigarette rod is formed having
the high-density portions.In order to cut the cigarette rod accurately in
the center of each high-density portion, the
rotational phases of the pockets of the trimming
