<ABSTRACT>
Triblock polymers comprised of polysaccharide, such as heparin or dextran, and a hydrocarbon chain, have been prepared. The triblock polymer adsorbs strongly on the surface of hydrophobic polymer substrates such as polyethylene, through hydrophobic interaction between the polymer and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chain of the triblock polymer. The surface adsorbed with triblock polymer is resistant to protein deposition, which renders the surface nonthrombogenic.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NONTHROMBOGENIC IMPLANT SURFACESBackground of the invention The use of synthetic biomaterials to sustain, augment10 or completely replace diseased human organs has increased tremendously over the past thirty years. Synthetic implants have cardiovascular applications such as vascular grafts, heart valves, and ventricular assist devices; extracorporeal systems; and a wide range of invasive15 treatment and diagnostic systems. Unfortunately, existing biomaterials suffer from well-known problems associated with surface-induced thrombosis or clot formation such as thrombotic occlusion and thromboemboli, and infection. Synthetic vascular grafts having a diameter less than 6 mm20 are currently impracticable, because of potential thrombotic occlusion, and the artificial heart has been plagued with problems of thromboemboli and infection. Advances in the development of artificial organs and artificial vascular grafts have resulted in the need for25 nonthrombogenic materials.Thrombosis is initiated by the deposition of a plasma protein layer on the surface of the implanted biomaterial. Thereafter, platelets, fibrin, and possibly leukocytes, adhere to the deposited protein. The interactions between30 the plasma proteins and the surface of the implant determine the adhesion, the activation and the spreading of platelets, the activation of coagulation, cell attachment and protein deposition. However, at the molecular level, the fundamental forces and interactions of plasma proteins ) " 35 with implants is not well understood.There have been several attempts to create nonthrombogenic surfaces on polymer implants thereby increasing the blood-biocompatibility of implants. 

 Early attempts included precoating the implants with proteins not involved in thrombosis, such as albumin, to mask the thrombogenic surface of the implant. However, such implants loose their nonthrombogenic properties within a short time. Attempts have been made to mask the thrombogenic surface by coating gelatin onto implants such as ventricular assist devices. While the gelatin coating reduced the thrombus formation, it did not adhere to the implant and it did not prevent thromboemboli and infection. Attempts have been made to render implants nonthrombogenic by coating the surface of the implant with polyethylene oxide to mask the thrombogenic surface of the implant; it was discovered that such a coating at times also reduced protein adsorption. While this reduced thrombogenesis, the coupling of polyethylene oxide to the surface of the implant
