<ABSTRACT>
Process and system for the magnetic recording of data on several parallel tracks, whereby data is recorded on a track by induction of a magnetic field having a given direction in an area of said track. During said recording, a magnetic field having an opposite direction is induced in adjacent track areas. For this purpose, the winding (L0, L1, L2) of each head is coupled to at least the windings (L0, L1, L2) of the adjacent heads. A control current transmitted to said head thereby produces at least one derived current which goes to adjacent heads. Application in the correction of crosstalk during reading of high density magnetic recordings.

<CLAIMS>
Magnetic recording device comprising at least
one series of magnetic recording heads allowing

information to be recorded on several tracks of a
magnetic recording medium, each head inducing a

magnetic write flux in one track and magnetic crosstalk
fluxes in the neighbouring tracks, the winding (L0, L1,

L2) of each head being coupled at least to the windings
(L0, L1, L2) of the heads which neighbour it,

characterized in that a control current transmitted to
the said head gives rise to at least one current

diverted to the neighbouring heads which then induce a
magnetic flux, in the said neighbouring tracks, which

counters the crosstalk flux.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the control current of a first head induces a

magnetic flux which is partly diverted to the
neighbouring heads, the first head being coupled to the

neighbouring heads via at least one coupling resistor
(Rd10, Rd12), the value of which is adjusted so that

the current diverted by the coupling resistor induces a
magnetic flux which counters the diverted magnetic

fluxes.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the control windings of the magnetic heads are

wound (L0, L1, L2) in approximately the same way and
have an input and an output for the control current,

the input of the first head being connected to the
outputs of the neighbouring heads in such a way that 

the control current of the first head flows through
this head from the input to the output, whereas the

diverted currents flow through the neighbouring heads
from the output to the input.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the windings (L0, L1, L2) of the neighbouring

heads are wound in opposite directions and supplied in
the same direction.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises a matrix of magnetic heads controlled

by data row wires (L0.0 to L2.n) and selection column
wires (C0.0 to C2.m), a magnetic head being controlled

by the flow of a defined current in a data row wire and
of a defined current in a selection column wire, each

row wire being coupled to each neighbouring row wire
via a coupling impedance (Rd1.0, Rd1.2) and each column

wire being coupled to each neighbouring column wire via
a coupling impedance (RC1.0, RC1.2').
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that each selection column wire is connected via its

two access points to two supply circuits which are at
high impedance when the supply is cut off, each access

point of each column wire being coupled to a
corresponding access point of each neighbouring column

wire.
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in
that, since each row wire is common to the magnetic

heads of a row of the matrix, a row wire is coupled to
each neighbouring row wire via a common coupling

impedance and, since each column wire is common to the
magnetic heads of a column of the matrix, a column wire

is coupled to each neighbouring column wire via a
common coupling impedance.
Device according to either of Claims 5 and 6,
characterized in that each access point of each column

wire is coupled to the corresponding access point of
each neighbouring column wire via a common coupling

impedance. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that each head comprises at least one control winding

wire (L0, L1, L2) which is also wound in the
neighbouring heads, the assembly being series-supplied.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 9,
characterized in that it comprises a matrix of magnetic

heads controlled by data row wires (L0.0 to L2.n) and
selection column wires (C0.0 to C2.m), a data row wire

being series-connected to two crosstalk compensation
wires (M0, M2) associated with the neighbouring rows

and a column wire being series-connected to two
crosstalk compensation wires (C0, C2) associated with

the neighbouring columns.
Magnetic recording system comprising a
recording medium capable of recording on several

parallel tracks, as well as a recording device
according to any one of Claims 2 to 10, the said

magnetic recording heads being arranged near the
recording medium so as to record information on the

said tracks.
Recording system according to Claim 11,
characterized in that the recording medium is a

magnetic tape or a magnetic disk.
