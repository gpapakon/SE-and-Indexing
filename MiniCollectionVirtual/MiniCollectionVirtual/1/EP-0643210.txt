<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for additional variation of the idling speed in engine control systems, which have an idling speed adjustment with superimposed pilot air control, in which an actuator controls the combustion air fed to the engine. Provided that the engine speed set on the basis of the current engine operating variables is lower than an additionally presettable minimum speed, the actuator is triggered so that the minimum engine speed is assumed.

<CLAIMS>
Method for subsequently varying the idling speed 
in an engine control which has an idling regulator with 

superimposed air precontrol, in which an actuator 
controls the combustion air fed to the engine,
 
characterized 


in that a minimum engine speed (NMIN) is subsequently 
prescribed, 
in that an additive quantity of air (ALW) is calculated 
as a function of the present engine speed and the 

difference (NDIFF) between the desired engine speed 
(NDES) and the minimum engine speed (NMIN) and 
in that the actuation of the idling air actuator takes 
place as a function of the sum of the quantity of air 

which is necessary to reach the desired engine speed 
(NDES) and the additive quantity of air (ALW). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the additive quantity of air (ALW) is zero if the 

desired engine speed (NDES) is greater than or equal to 
the minimum engine speed (NMIN). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the minimum engine speed (NMIN) can be prescribed 

externally. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the minimum engine speed (NMIN) is stored in a 

non-volatile memory. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the minimum engine speed (NMIN) can also be 

prescribed by the engine control itself. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the respectively highest engine speed of a plurality  

 
of simultaneously prescribed minimum engine speeds is 

used. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the operating variables on which the idling engine 

speed is dependent are the coolant temperature (TKW) and 
the status of additional loads presently connected into 

the circuit. 
Method according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that this additional load comprises an air conditioning 

system or an automatic gearbox or a combination of both.
