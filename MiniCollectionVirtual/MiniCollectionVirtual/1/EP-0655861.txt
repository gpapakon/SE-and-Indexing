<ABSTRACT>
Sub-images are merged in order to form an assembled image representing 
an elongate scene. In order to counteract artifacts in the assembled image such as 

disturbing transitions at the boundaries of adjacent sub-images in the image assembly 
method in accordance with the invention, pixel-values of overlapping portions of 

consecutive sub-images are interpolated so as to form pixel-values of the assembled 
image. The relative shift between consecutive sub-images with respect to the elongate 

scene is calculated from image information contained in the sub-images themselves. 
Correlations of pixel-values in overlapping portions of consecutive sub-images are 

determined as a function of the shift-value of the shift between consecutive sub-images 
with respect to the elongate scene. The actual shift between consecutive sub-images is 

found as the shift-value for which the correlation attains its maximum-value. 
The image assembly method in accordance with the invention is 
particularly suitable for use in peripheral x-ray angiography. Consecutive sub-images 

are made by x-irradiations of e.g. a patient's leg with an x-ray imaging system 
comprising an x-ray source, an x-ray detector, in various positions relative to the 

patient. 
In order to induce a sufficient amount of contrast in the sub-images to 
enable the determination of the relative shift between consecutive sub-images the
 
invention proposes to image a contrasting object together with the elongate scene itself. 

Preferably the contrasting object has the form of a ruler with a binary pattern which 
may be incorporated in the patient table.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an image composition method comprising the steps of
making a series of consecutive sub-images each representing a portion of an elongate scene,
which sub-images overlap along the elongate scene, and of merging the sub-images into an
assembled image. The invention also relates to x-ray examination apparatus comprising an image
processor for performing said method.An image composition method of said kind and a device for performing this
method are described in the European Patent Application EP 0 576 066 which is comprised in
the state of the art pursuant to Art. 54(3)EPC. An image composition method and a device for
performing such a method are also known from the United States Patent US 5 123 056.
Further the United States Patent US 4 644 575 discloses that an image is composed from
successive x-ray shadow images of a slit. Further, the Japanese patent application no.
JP 05-130 984 discloses an X-ray CT device which overlap scans the boundaries of images
and an interpolation processing is executed to the data obtained by this overlap scan.The United States Patent US 5 123 056 in particular discloses an image
composition method for use in peripheral angiography by means of x-ray radiography. The x-ray
examination apparatus described in the cited reference comprises an x-ray source, an x-ray
detector facing the x-ray source and a patient table. The patient table on the one hand and the
x-ray source and the x-ray detector on the other hand are displaceable with respect to one
another. Consecutive sub-images of adjacent portions of a patient's limb are made by
successive irradiations while the patient is translated vis-Ã -vis the x-ray source over some
distance between successive irradiations. X-ray imaging is performed on the patient's limb in
peripheral angiography. Because of the size of the limb of interest, an x-ray examination
apparatus is unable to image the entire limb at once during a single irradiation step. Instead, a
number of x-ray sub-images are made of a patient's limb that is to be examined. These x-ray
sub-images are converted into electronic sub--images by means of an x-ray image detector in
the form of an image intensifier television chain that is included in the x-ray examination
apparatus. In order to form a single image of entire limb the electronic sub-images 
are processed in such a way that overlapping portions of said electronic sub-images
are deleted. Subsequently from said processed electronic sub-images an assembled image is
formed by adjoining together
