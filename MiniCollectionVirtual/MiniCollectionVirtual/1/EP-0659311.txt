<ABSTRACT>
An equalizer (100) is suitable for removing the delay distortion from a switched digital signal received from a telephone channel where the delay distortion is caused by a bridge-tap connected to the telephone channel. The equalizer includes a feedback delay circuit (200) which is arranged to delay the output signal (150) by an amount of time based on the square of the predominant frequency of the output signal. The resulting delayed feedback signal (130) is then combined with the input signal, thereby compensating for the delay distortion. The equalizer also includes an amplifier (103) which may be adjusted to compensate to the attenuation distortion caused by the bridge tap.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BRIDGE-TAP EQUALIZER METHOD AND APPARATUSField of the Invention This application relates to equalizers including, but not limited to, a bridge-tap equalizer method and apparatus.Background of the Invention It is known to provide switched digital services via two-wire telephone channels. Modern digital services, for example, are capable of providing switched digital rates of up to 160 Kbps. A typical problem with providing such service, however, is that the telephone line may include a bridge-tap on the line. This bridge-tap results in a received signal that includes an amount of bridge-tap distortion. In the past, the compensation for bridge-tap distortion on lower speed lines has consisted of implementing an echo cancellation stage in a digital signal processor ("DSP"). While a DSP solution provides adequate compensation for bridge-tap line connections at the voice and lower '.peed modem frequencies, the DSP approach is not a cost- effective solution at the 160 Kbps switched digital rates due to the clock speed required to provide the necessary .sampling rate. 

 As a result, there is a need to provide a hardware-based bridge- tap equalizer that is capable of compensating for bridge-tap distortion at rates of 160 Kbps.Brief Description of the DrawingsFIG. 1 is a block diagram that shows a first embodiment 100 of a bridge-tap equalizer, in accordance with the present invention. FIG. 2 shows further detail for FIG. 1.Description of the Preferred EmbodimentAn unterminated bridge-tap connection can be modeled using a fixed time delay and attenuation determined by the length and loss characteristics of the bridge-tap line. The bridge-tap distortion comprises an attenuation distortion component and a delay distortion component. The resulting distortion can be removed from the received signal I by using the arrangement of FIG. 1.Referring to FIG. 1 , there is shown a first embodiment of a bridge- tap equalizer, in accordance with the present invention. As shown, the equalizer includes a delay circuit 200 and a summing amplifier 103. The input signal 140, designated I, includes delay distortion and attenuation distortion caused by a bridge-tap connection that is coupled to the input telephone line 110. In FIG. 1 , the bridge-tap itself is not shown. The input signal I is coupled to a summing junction 121 via a resistor 105. The summing junction 121 combines the input signal I with a first feedback signal, designated X', via a resistor 115, thus forming a combined signal, designated C. The combined signal C is
