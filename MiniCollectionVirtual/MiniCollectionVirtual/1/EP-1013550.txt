<ABSTRACT>
A composite ring member comprises an annular
ring member (112) and an annular reinforcing ring

member (114) welded to the external peripheral portion
of the annular ring member (112). The annular ring

member comprises a tubular stock member, having a
substantially rectangular or square-shaped cross-sectional

configuration, which is bent into the form of the annular
ring member (112) and the free end portions thereof are

welded together. In this manner, excessive waste of
material in forming conventional ring members are cut out

from square plates, is eliminated. Segmentally-configured
gusset plate members (126,128) are welded to diametrically

opposite internal peripheral portions of the annular ring
member (112) so as to respectively support a film roll

carriage and dispensing assembly and a counterbalancing
mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to film wrapping
or packaging machines, and more particularly to a new and
improved film carriage support ring, for use within horizontal
stretch film wrapping or packaging machines, and a method of
making the same.Film wrapping or packaging machines are of course
well known and comprise two different primary types of machines.
A first primary type of film wrapping or packaging
machine is the vertical type packaging or wrapping machine
wherein a ring member, upon which a roll of stretch film wrapping
material is mounted by means of a suitable carriage having
a dispensing mechanism or tensioning assembly incorporated
therein, is rotated around a vertical axis. The ring member,
as well as the carriage, the roll of stretch film wrapping
material, and the stretch film dispensing and tensioning mechanism
mounted upon the ring member, are also mounted upon a
vertically reciprocable frame member which, in turn, is movably
mounted upon and within a fixed structural framework. Accordingly, when it is desired to wrap an article
to be packaged or wrapped, wherein the article is disposed,
for example, at a fixed wrapping station defined within the
fixed structural framework, the ring member is rotated in a
substantially horizontal plane and about its vertical axis,
while being simultaneously moved in the vertical direction by
means of the vertically reciprocable frame member, whereby the
roll of stretch film wrapping material, mounted upon the rotatable
ring member by means of the carriage assembly, encircles
and completely wraps or envelops the article within the
film wrapping or packaging material.The second primary type of film wrapping or packaging
machine is the horizontal type packaging or wrapping machine
wherein such machines are often used to wrap or package,
among other types or articles to be packaged or wrapped, substantially
elongated loads which would otherwise be difficult
to wrap or package if the vertical type of wrapping or packaging
machine was employed. In the horizontal type packaging or
wrapping machine, a ring member, upon which a roll of stretch
film wrapping material is mounted by means of a suitable carriage
having a dispensing mechanism or tensioning assembly incorporated
therein, is rotated around a horizontal axis. The
ring member is usually axially stationary and a first conveyor
is operatively associated therewith so as to move the article
to be wrapped through the interior open-space portion of the
ring member which thereby in effect defines a
