screw arrangement (20), characterised thereby that the fitting associated 

with the appliance door (14) is constructed as recesses (17) which are 
arranged at one of the horizontal door sections (16), project niche-like 

into the door body and into which the fitting arranged at the furniture 
front plate (15) is substantially capable of penetrating with the play 

required for the three-dimensional aligning, wherein the fitting arranged 
at the furniture front plate (15) is connected with the fitting 

associated with the appliance door (14) by means of the setting and 
clamping screw arrangement (20). 
Household appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby that
