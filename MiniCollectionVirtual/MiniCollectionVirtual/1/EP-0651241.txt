<ABSTRACT>
The detector comprises a gas analyser (1), a pumping unit connected to the analyser and comprising a secondary pump (2) and a primary pump (3), and a conduit (4) connecting on inlet flange (5) to the gas analyser (1). It is characterised in that the gas analyser (1) is of the "cold cathode" type with ionisation by an electric field and deflection of the ions by a magnetic field. With such an apparatus, the operating method consists in that preevacuation of the article to be tested is carried out by the entire pumping unit (2, 3), the analyser (1) not being supplied, and in that it is supplied and that the test is carried out as soon as the pressure in the analyser is 
<
/= 10
<
-4
>
 mbar.

A tracer gas leak detector comprising at least one gas analyzer
(1), a pump unit connected to the gas analyzer and comprising a

secondary pump (2) and a primary pump (3), and a duct (4) connecting
an inlet coupling (5) to the gas analyzer at a point between the gas

analyzer and the inlet of the secondary pump, characterized in that
said gas analyzer (1) is of the "cold cathode" type in which

ionization is performed by an electric field, and in which ion
selection is performed by deflection in a magnetic field.
A method of operating a leak detector according to claim 1,
characterized by the fact that with the detector connected to a part

to be tested, the method begins by pre-evacuating the part using said
pump unit (2, 3) connected to the analyzer (1), said analyzer being

switched off, and by the fact that the analyzer (1) is subsequently
switched on to perform testing as soon as the pressure inside the

analyzer is â‰¤ 10
-4
 mbar.
A leak detector operating method according to claim 2,
characterized by the fact that pressure is measured in the analyzer

by the triode gauge to be found in the analyzer, and that this is
done from a relatively high pressure because of the ability of said

gauge to perform measurements from a pressure of about 10
-2
 mbar.
