<ABSTRACT>
A syringe(12) for collecting expiration is switched 
to be connected to by a three-way electromagnetic 

valve(10) between an expiration blowing part(2) and a 
measuring part(14), so that expiration blown from the 

expiration blowing part(2) is collected in the 
syringe(12) while replacing old expiration, and a 

switching valve(18) is closed upon completion of 
exhalation so that end-tidal air is collected in the 

syringe(12). Thereafter the expiration sample is 
introduced into the measuring part(14) from the 

syringe(12) so that a constant amount of the expiration 
sample is collected by the measuring part(14) to be 

introduced into a column(24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
collecting a constant amount of expiration from a subject 
for analyzing the expiration collected from the subject 
as a sample by an analyzer such as a gas chromatograph, a 
CO₂ sensor or the like, and an automatic expiration 
collector. A clinical test for diagnosing, curing or preventing 
a disease is generally made on blood or urine. On the 
other hand, expiration is employed in the laboratory 
level as a specimen for a clinical biochemical test other 
than those for blood and urine, leading to such 
recognition that expiration also includes information as 
to a disease. Methods of collecting a specimen of expiration for 
measuring components of the expiration specimen by an 
analyzer such as a gas chromatograph are roughly  
 
classified into three types, i.e., a chemical trap method 
of blowing expiration into a solvent for dissolving the 
former in the latter, a cold trap method of blowing a 
large amount of expiration into a cold trap which is 
cooled to about -80 °C, for example, for condensing the 
same, and an adsorption trap method of adsorbing 
expiration components to an adsorption trap which is 
charged with activated carbon or adsorption resin 
(Scientific American, July 1992, pp. 52 -- 57). Among 
these, the cold trap method and the adsorption trap 
method have already been put into practice. In the cold trap method, the sample as trapped is 
generally partially injected into a gas chromatograph 
through a micro syringe, to be subjected to analysis. 
However, it is extremely difficult to put this method 
into practice as clinical test means for a hospital 
routine which must be quickly and readily carried out 
while bringing the analyzer into the bedside of a patient. In the adsorption trap method, expiration components 
which are adsorbed by the trap are heated and desorbed to 
be introduced into a gas chromatograph. However, this 
method is not suitable for a clinical test for a routine 
which must be quickly and readily carried out while 
bringing the analyzer into the bedside of a patient 
either, in addition to such an essential problem that  
 
adsorptivity of the adsorption trap is varied with the 
components. A gas measurer such as a gas chromatograph is now 
being put into practice as a clinical test appliance with 
improvement of sensitivity, miniaturization and a 
technique of implementing portability. When such a gas 
measurer is applied to an expiration analyzer for 
carrying out a quick clinical test, it is necessary to 
simply
