<ABSTRACT>
A device for mechanically withdrawing threaded caps from bottles (2), such as caps (13) from juice or mineral water or even beer bottles, having at least one assembly which rotates the cap in the opening direction and at least one lifting assembly (6) which is used to transport the bottles is to be devised, by means of which it is possible to reduce the operations of the known devices and therefore to reduce the outlay on construction entailed by them. To achieve this, provision is made according to the invention for both a device (12) for holding and removing the bottles and a device (27) for rotating the caps (13) in the opening direction to be arranged coaxially with one another in the lifting assembly (6).

Device for mechanically removing screw caps (13) 
from bottles (2), such as caps of juice, mineral water or 

else beer bottles, having at least one unit which rotates 
the caps (13) in the opening direction and at least one 

lifting unit (6) which serves to transport the bottles 
(2), is held in a bearing plate (5) and in which there 

are arranged both a device for holding and removing the 
bottles and a device for rotating the caps (13) in the 

opening direction, characterized in that each lifting 
unit (6) is in each case provided with a separate rotary 

drive (40), in that an output pin (26') of the drive (40) 
extends vertically through a receiving bore in the 

bearing plate (5) and continues as drive shaft (26) 
beyond a coupling member (27), the drive shaft (26) being 

mounted in a piston shaft (10) which is positioned in the 
bearing plate (5) so as to be rotationally fixed but able 

to move upwards and downwards, the drive shaft running 
coaxially in the interior of the said piston shaft, in 

that the piston shaft (10) is arranged coaxially in the 
interior of a cylinder housing (9) which is connected to 

the bearing plate (5), it being possible to press the 
piston shaft (10) vertically downwards, that is to say 

against the bottle (2) from which the cap (13) is to be 
removed, relative to the cylinder housing (9), in that 

the piston shaft (10) is provided with a cone (20) which 
is arranged on its lower end and passes between at least 

two support rollers (21), which are mounted articulatedly 
on the cylinder housing (9) and are connected in a fixed 

manner to a lever (14), at the lower end of which gripper 
jaws (12), which engage on the bottle via a further  

 
joint, are pivotably arranged, and in that couplings 

which are arranged at the shaft end and engage on the cap 
(13) are provided between the lower end of the drive 

shaft (26) and the cap (13) to be removed. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the rotary drive (40) is a hydraulic motor. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that it is provided with a pneumatic 

lifting drive which, when actuated appropriately, presses 
the piston shaft (10) downwards relative to the cylinder 

housing (9) against the bottle (2) from which the cap 
(13) is to be removed. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the important parts of the pneumatic unit for the 

pneumatic lifting drive are arranged in the upper part of 
the head of th
e cylinder housing (9), which in turn is 
connected to the bearing plate (5) via a flange. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the flange is held on the bearing plate (5) by means 

of three screws distributed uniformly over the periphery 
of the said flange, it being possible to exchange the 

entire lifting unit (6) after loosening the screws. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the couplings arranged at the lower end 

of the drive shaft (26) are gripper-like jaws which 
engage frictionally on the cap (13). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the couplings between the end of the 

shaft (26) and the cap (13) comprise at least one pin 
(127) which is injection-moulded eccentrically at the end 

of the shaft (26) and penetrates through the cap (13) 
when the shaft (26) is moved downwards, resulting in a 

fixed connection between the pin (127) and the shaft (26) 
and the cap (13). 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the cap (13) which is attached to the shaft end can 

be removed by means of an ejector (30) 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the ejector (30) comprises a pin which is situated  

 
in the centre of the drive shaft (26) and is arranged so 

as to be longitudinally displaceable therein. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the ejector (30), if it is of pneumatic design, can 

be acted on by compressed air in the ejection direction, 
i.e. downwards. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the bearing plate (5) is horizontally 

movable in an associated frame (4) on rails (7, 8) 
arranged at that location. 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the starting and end positions of its movement can 

be fixed by means of a switch or the like. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the gripper jaws (12) are provided, 

on their side facing the bottle neck, with adhesion-promoting 
means.
