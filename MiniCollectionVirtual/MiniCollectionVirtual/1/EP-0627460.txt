<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic resin
composition excellent in bleed resistance and flame retardancy.
More particularly, it relates to a thermoplastic resin
composition which comprises specific amounts of (A) a melamine-coated
ammonium polyphosphate, (B) a nitrogen-containing
organic compound and (C) a thermoplastic resin and is excellent
in bleed resistance and flame retardancy.Due to their superiority in processability, chemical
resistance, weatherability, electrical properties, mechanical
strength, etc., thermoplastic resins have so far been used
extensively not only in the field of industrial and domestic
electrical products but also in various fields including
buildings, interior decorative articles and automotive parts,
and the applications in which thermoplastic resins are used
have been expanding. With the expansion of applications, the
thermoplastic resins also have come to be required to have
flame retardancy and the performance requirement has been
becoming severer year by year. Recently in particular, a
flame-retardant resin composition comprising a thermoplastic
resin and a halogen-containing compound or a flame-retardant
resin composition comprising a thermoplastic resin, a halogen-containing
compound and an antimony oxide, which compositions 
each are a main current in the conventional flame retardation
technology, are regarded as defective because they generate a
halogenous gas during combustion or molding. Accordingly, a
flame-retardant resin composition which does not generate such
a halogenous gas during combustion or molding has come to be
desired.In order to meet these requirements, a flame-retardant
resin composition containing ammonium polyphosphate and one or
more nitrogen-containing organic compounds which generate
nonflammable gases (water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen,
etc.) and a carbonaceous residue upon pyrolysis has been
proposed from recent investigations. For example, a flame-retardant
composition comprising a polymer or oligomer of a
1,3,5-triazine derivative and ammonium polyphosphate is
proposed in JP-A-59-147050 (corresponding to US-A-4,504,610)
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application") and EP-A-0475418; a
flame-retardant composition comprising ammonium polyphosphate
and a reaction product of a nitrogen compound having a >C=O,
>C=S or >NH group bonded to a cyclic structure with an aldehyde
is proposed in JP-A-52-146452 (corresponding to US-A-4,193,945);
a flame-retardant composition comprising
