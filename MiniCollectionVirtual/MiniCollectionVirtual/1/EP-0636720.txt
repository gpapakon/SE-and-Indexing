Device for the heat treatment of a moving yarn,
for example during a texturizing stretching operation, of

the type formed by an insulating chamber which surrounds
a heating unit with which it defines a "channel" which

can open to the outside, through which the yarn to be
treated passes, means for guiding said yarn being

provided for positioning it inside said oven, and in
which the moving yarn is subjected to two successive

treatments, one during which the temperature is greater
than that of the normal temperature to which it has to be

heated, and this for a time such that it is not damaged,
the first phase being followed by an equilibrating

treatment at a temperature heating the yarn to a conventional
temperature, these successive phases being

obtained by means of a heating unit (1) formed by a
cylindrical assembly comprising two heating zones (A, B),

on either side of which are provided guide means for the
yarn, said zones being obtained by means of two

resistance elements (R1, R2) embedded inside the
cylindrical assembly, these being mounted in parallel,

offset with respect to each other along the length of the
unit and each associated with a thermocouple element

(TC1, TC2) enabling said temperature to be regulated
accurately, characterized in that the heating unit has,

along its length, at least one large-diameter zone
consisting of a sleeve, with respect to the surface of

which the yarn is tangential, allowing it to be heated by
contact preceded and/or followed by a zone in which the

yarn is heated by radiation.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cylindrical heating unit is associated with two

sleeves D, D1 of the same diameter, separated from each
other, therefore making it possible to have two contact

heat-exchange zones, separated from each other by a zone
in which the yarn is heated by radiation.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the cylindrical heating unit is

formed by a ceramic or stainless steel cylinder (C), the
two electrical resistance elements R1, R2 being embedded

inside this cylinder and each being associated with the
thermocouple element, the electrical supply and the

connections of the thermocouple elements being located on
one and the same face.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it is designed so as to be able to

treat two yarns (F) simultaneously, the two yarns being
kept separate inside the oven either by means of suitable

guide elements or possibly in grooves at the very surface
of the "sleeve" or "sleeves" of the zone or zones in

which heat transfer is achieved by contact.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the yarn is in contact with the

large-diameter zone (or zones) along a helical path.
