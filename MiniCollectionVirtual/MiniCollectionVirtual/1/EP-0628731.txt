<ABSTRACT>
A pilot-actuated servovalve with at least three main flow connections (50, 51, 52, 53) for space-saving installation in a control block is presented. The discharge into the control sleeve (5) for the first main flow connection (50) is formed opposite a piston end face (12) of the main control piston (6). In a pressure-compensation chamber (25), the main control piston (6) forms a pressure-compensation area (13). The pressure-compensation chamber (25) is hydraulically connected to the first main flow connection (50) by a pressure-relief passage (18, 20) in the main control piston (6). A return spring (24) exerts a spring force on the main control piston (6) in the direction of a first axial end stop and thus clearly secures a safety end position. The valve is distinguished by good dynamic behaviour.
