<ABSTRACT>
A granular enzyme composition is disclosed, having reduced tendencies to form dust and leave residue, and exhibiting improved stability and delayed release characteristics. The granular composition comprises a core, an enzyme layer and an outer coating layer. The enzyme layer, and optionally the core and coating layers, contain a vinyl polymer. Also disclosed are methods for making such enzyme-containing granules, the methods having greatly reduced processing time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of US Application Serial Number
772,510, filed October 7, 1991.This invention relates to improvements in or relating to enzyme granules, as
well as improved processes for producing such granules.Recently the use of enzymes, especially of microbial origin, has been more
and more common. Enzymes are used in several industries including, for
example, the starch irdustry, the dairy industry, and the detergent
industry. It is well known in the detergent industry that the use of
enzymes, particularly proteolytic enzymes, has created industrial hygiene
concerns for detergent factory workers, particularly due to the health risks
associated with dustiness of the available enzymes.Since the introduction of enzymes into the detergent business, many
developments in the granulation and coating of enzymes to reduce enzyme dust
have been offered by the industry. However, in today's state of ever-increasing
environmental concern and heightened awareness of industrial
hygiene, there remains a continuing need for low dust enzyme granules.
Furthermore, there are additional characteristics desirable in enzyme
granules not currently available in known granulation products. Some of
these additional characteristics are related to the need to further
alleviate industrial hygiene concerns (lower dust granules) while optimizing 
customer and end-user satisfaction (oxidatively stable and low residue
granules) with the product while simultaneously reducing the cost of
granulation (improved processing time), thus reducing cost of the overall
enzyme product.Principal among these desirable characteristics is the need for delayed
release of the enzyme, preferably without having to increase the amount of
chlorine scavenger additives currently used in granulation techniques. This
delayed release has potential benefit, for example, in protecting enzymes
from oxidation or autolytic degradation in washing machines until sufficient
amounts of stabilizing proteins or peptides are released from dirty clothing
into the wash water. Additional desirable characteristics include low
residue granule formulations (where low residue is defined as a reduced
tendency to leave noticeable undissolved residues on clothes or other
material). This characteristic is desirable to the customer (end-user) of a
detergent formulation. In addition, improved stability (enhaced shelf
life) formulations are needed in the industry. Accomplishing all these
desired characteristics simultaneously while maintaining cost
