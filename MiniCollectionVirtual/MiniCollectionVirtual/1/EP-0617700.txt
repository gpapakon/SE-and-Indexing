<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sol-gel 
processes for producing monolithic articles of glass and, 
more particularly, to processes of this kind that are 
adapted to eliminate cracking of the gel during a final 
drying step. High purity glass components typically are 
fabricated either by melting solid raw materials or by 
vapor deposition. Melting solid raw materials is a 
generally effective technique, but difficulty is sometimes 
encountered in maintaining purity, due to recontamination 
from processing containers. In addition, energy costs due 
to high temperature processing can sometimes be excessive, 
and finishing costs to produce components of the desired 
final shapes can also sometimes be excessive. Vapor 
deposition likewise is a generally effective technique for 
fabricating high purity glass components. However, it too 
can be very expensive due to a relatively low material 
collection efficiency, a high investment cost in 
processing and pollution control equipment, and slow 
processing rates. Research has recently been conducted into the 
use of a sol-gel process for fabricating high purity 
monolithic articles of glass. In such processes, a 
desired solution of glass-forming compounds, solvents and 
catalysts, i.e., sol, is poured into a mold and allowed to 
react. Following hydrolysis and condensation reactions, 
the sol forms a porous matrix of solids, i.e., gel. With 
additional time, the gel shrinks in size by expelling 
fluids from its pores. The wet gel is then dried in a  
 
controlled environment, to remove remaining liquid from its 
pores, and it is then densitied into a solid monolith. The use of a sol-gel process to produce a gel 
monolith is described in Hench et al. United States Patent 
No. 4849378. This patent is directed to producing 
controlled pore distributions very small in scale and 
narrow in size range of the pores to form an ultraporous 
SiO₂-containing gel monolith. The ultraporosity of the gel 
is obtained by varying the temperature, duration, and other 
conditions of aging. By controlling the aging process, 
mean pore sizes can be varied from 10Å to 400Å radius with 
very narrow distributions of the size of the pores around 
the mean. Generally, the higher the temperature and the 
longer the time of aging, which can be as long as 30 days, 
the larger the mean pore size. Thus, this patent teaches 
that it is possible to tailor make a pore distribution for 
a specific application, such as a filter or catalyst 
support, by (i) adjusting the formamide

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a dry gel body comprising the 
steps of: 


selecting effective amounts of an alkyl 
orthosilicate, water, an alcohol and a catalyst comprising 

a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and hydrochloric acid, 
reacting together the selected amounts of the alkyl 
orthosilicate and water, in the presence of the selected 

amounts of the alcohol and the catalyst, to form a porous 
wet gel; and
