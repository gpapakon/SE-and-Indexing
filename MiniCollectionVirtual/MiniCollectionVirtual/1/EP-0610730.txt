<ABSTRACT>
A shielding vent (10) for an electromagnetic interference 
shielded enclosure (20) having an electrically 

conducting wall shield (21) includes a mounting 
plate or flange (12) through which extends a vent 

pipe (14) with an internal septum plate or divider (16) 
extending axially along at least a portion of the inner 

length of the vent pipe. The mounting plate (12) is 
secured to a wall (18) of the shielded enclosures 

(20) over an opening in the wall and to the wall 
shield (21) to insure that the integrity of the shielding 

for the enclosure is maintained. With the mounting 
plate (12) so mounted on the wall of the enclosure, 

the vent pipe (14) extends through the opening in 
the wall and provides fluid communication between 

an internal region of the enclosure and a region 
external of the enclosure. The septum plate (16) has 

a cross section in the shape of a cross so that at 
least a portion of the length of the cylindrically 

shaped vent pipe (14) is subdivided into four parallel, 
axially extending equal fluid flow sections (42 - 48). 

These fluid flow sections are sufficiently large in 
cross sectional area that they provide a minimum of  

 
resistance to fluid flowing through the vent pipe (14). 

By using the cross-shaped septum plate (16) in the 
vent pipe, the vent pipe can be made significantly 

shorter in length than previously used vent pipes of 
similar diameter, yet the vent affords an adequate 

degree of EM shielding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and, more 
particularly, to a new and improved shielding vent for 
an electromagnetic interference shielded enclosure as 
specified in the pre-characterizing clause of the appended 
claim 1. Diagnostic equipment, such as magnetic 
resonance imaging equipment, are typically used within a 
shielded enclosure. The shielded enclosure is used to 
inhibit electromagnetic radiation, such as radio frequency 
radiation and the like, from interfering with the 
operation of the equipment in the enclosure. Such 
enclosures may be a room or some similar structure that 
is located within a parent or larger room or structure. 
The shielded enclosure may include a single shield or 
multiple shields of electrically conductive metal and/or 
metal mesh or screen that provides the necessary shielding 
of the space within the enclosure. In certain 
instances, the shield is in the form of a conductive 
metal skin or layer, such as a thin sheet or foil of 
copper, that is disposed on the outer walls of the 
enclosure. The shielded enclosure and in certain 
instances, equipment located in the enclosure, need to 
be provided with adequate venting. The vents that are 
used for this purpose must still provide electromagnetic 
interference (EMI) shielding so that even though fluid  
 
may be allowed to flow through the vent, the vent nevertheless 
still will sufficiently attenuate any electromagnetic 
radiation that might adversely affect the 
equipment being used in the enclosure. This attenuation 
needs to be effective with respect to any waves that 
have a frequency below a given cutoff frequency. In 
order to provide this necessary electric field shielding, 
vents for such shielded enclosures have used honeycomb 
structures or panels disposed within the vent. US-A-3,546,359 (Ciccarelli), US-A-3,553,343 
(Garlington), US-A-3,580,981 (Lamp et al.), US-A-3,584,134 
(Nichols et al.) disclose shielded vents that can be used 
as vents for ventilating units for shielded or protected 
enclosures. In each of these patents, the structure that 
is used to provide the vent with RFI or EMI protection is 
a honeycomb panel or structure. For example, back-to-back 
honeycomb panels 26 and 28 are used in a vent 10 disclosed 
in US-A-3,546,359. The panels 26 and 28 are inclined upwardly 
and inwardly toward the junction between the panels. 
In US-A-3,553,343 a honeycomb grill 15 (shown particularly 
in FIG. 1 thereof) is disposed in an air duct housing 12
