<ABSTRACT>
In a pressurised container (1) for the transport and/or storage of bulk products, whose bottom and top walls (2, 3) and the side walls (4, 5) are constructed so as to have a concave curvature towards the container interior (6) and are supported by a bearing structure (10), the bearing structure (10) consists of a plurality of support beams (11, 11'...) which are arranged with mutual lateral spacing, are attached to the walls (2, 3, 4, 5) of the pressurised container (1) on their outsides, and are approximately U-shaped in cross-section. Due to this design, in spite of the sturdy construction, the membrane effect of the walls (2, 3, 4, 5) of the pressurised container (1) is not destroyed and there is an even tension distribution. Additionally, the permissible stresses on the container walls (2, 3, 4, 5) can be utilised to the full extent and the interior (6) of the pressurised container (1) is free from cumbersome interior fittings.
