<ABSTRACT>
Device for limiting hydrocarbon emissions for a vehicle equipped with an internal combustion engine, in which the return-to-tank (1) line (7, 7') of the fuel supply circuit of the engine passes through a heat exchanger (8) placed in a filter (4) for collecting fuel vapours, the said exchanger being designed so that, simultaneously, on the one hand it cools the fuel returning to the tank in order to limit evaporation thereof, and, on the other hand, it heats up the active charcoal of the filter in order to facilitate desorption of fuel vapours.
