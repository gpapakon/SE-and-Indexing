<ABSTRACT>
A baffle assembly (10) for use in an ultrasonic system for 
measuring the level of a contained volume of liquid by 

calculating the density of the liquid by means including 
the determination of the dielectric constant thereof. The 

baffle assembly (10) is located at the lower end of the 
stillwell (13) located within the volume of liquid. The 

assembly includes a pair of concentric sleeves (15,16) 
formed of electrically conductive material located to 

surround the lower end portion of the stillwell (13). The 
sleeves (15,16) are uniformly radially spaced from one 

another so as to function as a capacitor so that the 
electrical capacitance between the respective opposed 

surfaces of the sleeves may be determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ultrasonic liquid level measuring
device located in a tank for determining a level of a liquid
contained in the tank, the device including a tube adapted to
contain a column of the liquid for ultrasonic determination of
the length of the column, the tube having a lower end portion
having at least one opening to permit entry of the liquid into
the tube, the device also comprising two members that comprise
an electrically conductive material and that are electrically
insulated from one another and from the tube and the tank so as
to function as a capacitor, and means for determining the
capacitance between the members.Such an ultrasonic liquid level measuring device is known from
US-A-4229798. In this known device, a plurality of holes are
provided near a lower end of the tube. The members take the form
of two arcuate plates located within the tube. The arcuate
plates and the capacitance determining means function to detect
the level of water lying below fuel, oil or petrol stored in the
tank.It is desirable to provide a device in which the determination
of the length of the column is improved.Additionally, some ultrasonic fuel measurement systems may
require the determination of the fuel dielectric constant in
order to calculate the density of the liquid. It is important to
calculate fuel density on a continuous basis due to variations
thereof that occur in response to temperature changes, changes
in the velocity of sound and in the dielectric constant. Accordingly, these particular systems must utilize an electrical
device or sensor to determine the dielectric constant.Such dielectric sensors are typically constructed of a number of
concentric sleeves immersed in the liquid. The sleeves are formed
of an electrically conductive material and are adapted to
function as the plates of a capacitor. By determining the
electrical capacitance between the opposed surfaces of the
immersed concentric tubes, the dielectric constant can be
calculated.It will be seen that these requirements, among others, dictate
that a rather complex assembly be provided in order to properly
utilize the tube (otherwise termed a "stillwell" or "probe") to
obtain the fuel level measurements sought.According to the invention, therefore, the ultrasonic liquid
level measuring device as first set forth above is characterised
in that the two members are, respectively, first and second
mutually concentric sleeves, each sleeve surrounding the tube
lower end portion and having at least one radially extending
opening
