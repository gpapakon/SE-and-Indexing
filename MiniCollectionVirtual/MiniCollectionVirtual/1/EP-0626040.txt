<ABSTRACT>
A flooded compressor system has a compressor unit (10) with intermeshing rotors and a separator (12) for retaining a volume of liquid. The separator (12) is arranged to receive compressed gas and liquid discharged from the compressor unit (10) through an outlet (17) and is formed solely by a single length of pipe or conduit of substantially uniform cross section throughout its length and having a first substantially horizontal portion (19) to retain a liquid pool (18) and a second elevated portion (23) connected to the first portion by a bend (22) in the pipe or conduit. A compressed gas outlet (25) leads from the second elevated portion (23) to a separate filter element (14), and a liquid filter element (30) is mounted from, and communicates directly with, the first horizontal portion (19) of the pipe or conduit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in flooded compressor 
systems utilizing a separator vessel and particularly to such systems 
employing screw rotors or similar inter-engaging rotating parts to effect 
compression of a gas. Systems of the aforementioned kind conventionally comprise a 
number of major component parts including a compressor unit including 
inter-engaging rotors adapted to receive the gas (normally air) to be 
compressed through an inlet filter and a main throttle valve. Lubricating oil 
for the rotors is also introduced into the compressor unit adjacent its inlet 
zone and a mixture of compressed gas and oil is discharged from this unit to 
be separated in a separator vessel. Oil collected in the separator vessel is 
returned via an oil filter and an oil cooler to the compressor unit inlet zone 
and clean compressed gas is discharged usually to a receiving vessel from 
which it is withdrawn as desired by an end user. The discharged 
compressed gas is normally passed through a coalescent type final filter to 
remove any remaining fine oil droplets. This filter element is commonly 
housed within the main separator vessel as shown in US 4,070,166 or 
within an extension of the main separator vessel manufactured for the 
purpose of containing the filter element. Australian Patent No. 284787 
discloses another form of a compressor system where an oil separator is 
provided in which filter discs are provided which span the whole cross-section 
of the separator and through which the compressed gas passes and 
where oil is collected forwardly of an downstream of the filter discs to be 
returned to a separate oil tank. Problems associated with conventional filter 
element positioning as shown in US 4,070,166 are discussed in EP-A-0 121 999. 
There are a number of difficulties associated with 
conventional arrangements of compressor systems as disclosed particularly 
in US 4,070,166 and EP-A-0 121 999. These include the 
physical size of the system which may include two relatively large pressure 
tanks, one acting as the separator vessel and the other forming the clean  
 
gas receiving vessel. A further problem is associated with the oil cooler 
which commonly comprises a pair of header manifolds interconnected by a 
plurality of finned heat exchange tubes through which the oil must pass after 
being discharged from the separator vessel. A still further problem with 
conventional arrangements is the number of pipes or lines that must be 
used to interconnect various component parts in
