<ABSTRACT>
A liquid metering and coating device made of a liquid permeation control
material (6, 16) including porous polytetrafluoroethylene, adhered to a porous

support material (4, 14) of open-celled foam. The porous support (4, 14) and
permeation control material (6, 16) contain mixtures of silicone oil and silicone

rubber which bond to the porous support material (6, 16) and form an
interconnected network of silicone rubber throughout the device. The device is

suitable for use as a part of a toner fixation mechanism in a plain paper copying
machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to materials and devices for coating controlled amounts of liquids on to rolls or other surfaces, more particularly to devices for coating release liquids on the surface of rolls in toner fixation assemblies of plain paper copying machines.In plain-paper (PPC) copying machine toner images applied to the surface of paper or other recording medium are fixated by application of heat and pressure. In certain PPC copying machines fixation is accomplished by passing the image-bearing recording medium between a hot thermal-fixation roll and a pressure roll. When this type of thermal-fixation device is used the toner material is directly contacted by a roll surface and a portion of the toner adheres to the roll surface. With subsequent rotation of the roll the adhered toner material may be redeposited on the recording medium resulting in undesirable offset images, stains, or smears; or, in severe cases, the recording medium may stick to the adhered toner material on the roll and become wrapped around the roll.To counter these problems materials having good release properties such as silicone rubber of polytetrafluoroethylene are often used for the roll surfaces. Although improving performance of the thermal fixation device, use of silicone rubber or polytetrafluoroethylene roll surfaces alone do not eliminate the problems. Another approach used to counter the problems is to include release agents with the toner materials to prevent them from adhering to the roll surface. These oilless toners also improve performance of the thermal-fixation devices but again, particularly in the case of high-speed type copying machines, do not completely eliminate the problems associated with toner pickup and transfer.Toner pickup by the rolls can be controlled by coating the surface of at least one of the rolls of a thermal-fixation device with a liquid release agent, such as a silicone oil. It is important that the release liquid be applied uniformly and in precise quantities to the surface of the roll. Too little liquid, or non-uniform surface coverage, will not prevent the toner from being picked up and redeposited on the roll. On the other hand, excessive quantities of the release liquid may cause silicone rubber roll surfaces to swell and wrinkle, thus producing copies of unacceptable quality. Furthermore, procedures intended to accommodate excess liquids by wiping or scraping them from the roll surface do not always produce favourable results and, in some cases, the efforts result in static
