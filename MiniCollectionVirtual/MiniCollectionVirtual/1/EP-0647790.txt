<ABSTRACT>
A protective bellows has bellows turns (10A) each with a 
peak (16A) where faces (19A,20A) of the material of the 

bellows integrally meet. Each bellows turn (10A) is 
joined to the next bellows turn (10A) by a trough (18A). 

The face (20A) of each bellows turn (10A) which joins that 
turn to the next turn (10A) nearer to the larger diameter 

end (11) of the bellows is arranged to be almost coaxial 
with the bellows. Preferably, the diameter across the 

bellows at the peak of each turn is not more than 15% 
greater than the diameter across the bellows at the trough 

between that bellows turn and the next bellows turn nearer 
the larger diameter end (11) of the bellows. This 

configuration enables the bellows to be produced from 
thermoplastic material by injection moulding instead of 

blow-moulding. The particular configuration of the 
bellows turns ensures that the bellows can be removed from 

the injection mould with the minimum of stretching and 
without deformation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to protective bellows. A bellows 
embodying the invention and to be described below by way 
of example is for protecting universal joints such as used 
in the transmission of front wheel drive motor vehicles. According to the invention, there is provided a bellows 
made from thermoplastic material by injection moulding, 
comprising a plurality of bellows turns on a conical 
generatrix, the peak of each bellows turn being defined by 
two faces of the thermoplastic material which meet at that 
peak, the diameter across the bellows at the peak of each 
bellows turn being not more than 15% greater than the 
diameter across the bellows at the trough which joins that 
bellows turn to the next bellows turn closer to the larger 
diameter end of the bellows. According to the invention, there is also provided a 
protective bellows made from thermoplastic material by 
injection moulding, comprising a plurality of bellows 
turns arranged on a conical generatrix, each turn of the 
bellows having a peak defined by two relatively inclined  
 
faces of the material which integrally meet at the peak 
and each bellows turn being joined to the next bellows 
turn by a trough in the material, the face of each bellows 
turn which joins its peak to the trough between that turn 
and the next bellows turn nearer the larger diameter end 
of the bellows being almost co-axial with the bellows. Protective bellows made from thermoplastic material and 
embodying the invention will now be described, by way of 
example only, with reference to the accompanying 
diagrammatic drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a half-view in elevation of a prior art 
bellows produced by blow-moulding; Figure 2 is a half-cross-section through the bellows of 
Figure 1; Figure 3 is a detailed view of part of some bellows turns 
of the bellows of Figures 1 and 2; Figure 4 corresponds to Figure 1 but shows a bellows 
embodying the invention;  Figure 5 corresponds to Figure 2 but relates to the 
bellows of Figure 4; Figure 6 is a detailed view of some of the turns of the 
bellows of Figures 4 and 5; and Figure 7 corresponds to Figure 6 but shows a modified 
design. The bellows of Figures 1 and 2 comprises a plurality of 
bellows turns 10 arranged around a shallow conical 
generatrix and extending between a larger diameter end 11 
and a smaller diameter end 12. The bellows ends 11 and 12 
are respectively provided with end collars 13 and 14 by 
means of which the bellows is fixed in position in use. 
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, and more

A bellows made from thermoplastic material by 
injection moulding, comprising a plurality of bellows 

turns (10; 10A) on a conical generatrix, the peak (16; 
16A) of each bellows turn (10; 10A) being defined by two 

faces (19,20; 19A,20A) of the thermoplastic material which 
meet at that peak (16; 16A), characterized in that the 

diameter (A) across the bellows at the peak (16; 16A) of 
each bellows turn (10; 10A) being not more than 15% 

greater than the diameter (B) across the bellows at the 
trough (18; 18A) which joins that bellows turn (10; 10A) 

to the next bellows turn closer to the larger diameter end 
(11) of the bellows, whereby to minimise stretching of the 

material upon removal of the bellows from the injection 
mould.
