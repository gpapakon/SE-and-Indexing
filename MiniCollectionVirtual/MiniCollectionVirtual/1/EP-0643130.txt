<ABSTRACT>
In a first aspect, the present invention concerns a 
granular detergent composition or component having a bulk 

density of at least 650 g/l, comprising a surfactant system 
wherein said composition or component comprises from 35% to 

85% by weight of nonionic surfactant and wherein said 
surfactant system is substantially in the solid phase at 

temperatures of 25°C and below, and that said surfactant 
system has a softening point above 25°C and wherein the 

surfactant system has a viscosity profile whereby the 
viscosity of the surfactant system is at least 20000 cps at 

a temperature of 10°C above the softening point, and less 
than 10000 cps at a temperature of 30°C above the softening 

point, all viscosities being measured at a shear rate of 
25s⁻¹. 
In a second aspect the present invention concerns specific 
combinations of the nonionic surfactant containing particle 

with other detergent components to produce a finished 
laundry detergent composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with granular detergent components or compositions which are rich in high performance nonionic surfactants. The compositions are based upon specified surfactant systems and of processes which make it possible to produce very high surfactant active components.Nonionic surfactants are important components of current laundry detergent compositions. Present trends demand particulate components or compositions which have a high bulk density and which have a high level of nonionic surfactant. The particulate must have good physical characteristics and must deliver nonionic surfactant which have been selected for high performance in to the wash. Various prior art attempts have been described which approach these demands from different perspectives. For example :EP-A-544492, published on 2nd June, 1993, discloses particulate high density detergent composition comprising 15 to 50% of a mixed anionic/nonionic surfactant system. The nonionic surfactants chosen are ethoxylated alcohols having a peaked ethoxylation distribution with an average of about 3 to 6.5. Although fatty acid soaps are suggested as suitable structurants which modify the surfactant viscosity profile the resulting granules where soap is used (in Examples 16 to 19, 24 to 29) have surfactant activities of 29 to 32.5%.WO-A-9206160, published on 16th April, 1992, discloses high performing nonionic surfactant systems based on mixtures of glucose amides and ethoxylated nonionic surfactants. In one example (example 20) a component is described which comprises a nonionic surfactant system which is a mixture of 20% Dobanol (Trade Name) EO3 and 80% N-methyl-glucose amide in aqueous solution. EP618290-A, filed on 30 march 1993 and published on 05.10.94. discloses in an example a mixture containing 35% nonionic surfactant, being a polyhydroxy fatty amide and an alcohol ethoxylate.EP-A-364881, published on 25th April 1990, describes gels formed from polyglycol ether derivatives and water in ratios of from 5:1 to 12. The gels are formed into free-flowing granulates by mixing with finely divided solids.The problem addressed by the present invention concerns the need to provide high density particulate laundry detergent which has a high nonionic surfactant content, and which does not cake or lump upon storage, even in hot. humid conditions, and which dissolves and disperses rapidly upon contact with water even cold water, to give a high detergency performance on the washing load.Whilst the prior art provides some guidance as
