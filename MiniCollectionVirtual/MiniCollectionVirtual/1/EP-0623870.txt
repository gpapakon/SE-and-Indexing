<ABSTRACT>
A control window for navigating and implementing menu selections in 
a multiple level hierarchical menu is provided having a first zone 

displaying a list of the selection levels and a second zone displaying a 
list of the selection options within a selection level. The second zone 

is refreshed with selections for another selection level in the menu 
hierarchy in response to a user implementation or registration of a 

selection option at the originally displayed selection level. Preset 
default settings in all selection levels permit the user to implement a 

"fast path" hierarchical menu selection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the general area of computer 
systems having a user interface providing selection options and display 
of multiple selection levels. "Menus" are the format used in computing environments for 
displaying to the user, in the form of prompts, the choices available to 
select and implement a computer task. In order to make user interfaces, such as menus, widely useable, it 
is important that the prompts displayed are accessible to the user, that 
is, the user can easily recognize the nature of the prompts and work with 
them. Displaying obscure prompts or cluttering a menu presentation 
simply confuses the user and reduces the usability of the computer 
application. Thus, where the choice set in a menu is too large to display at 
once, the menu is generally subdivided into a logically structured 
hierarchy that the user passes through by making selections at each level 
of the hierarchy and putting in place a complete set of command 
parameters for the computer's performance of the desired task. For further clarity of presentation, it is usually provided that 
the selection of an option at one level determines the displayed range of 
options for subsequent (lower) levels in the menu hierarchy. The forgoing leads to a common problem that arises in user 
interface design, namely the support of choice selection through the 
multiple levels or tiers of a hierarchical menu structure, especially 
where the range of choices available at one level is dependent on the 
selections made at a previous or higher level. A hierarchical menu situation can arise in many different types of 
applications, from the systems analyst's implementation of a database 
search or object/class query, to the everyday user's start-up of a 
personal computer management program. For example, a query action may require the specification of 
several (possibly four or more) query field values, where each is chosen  
 
from a mutually exclusive set of values or choices. Furthermore, 
selection of the first value may change the available set for the second 
value, and so on through to the last level or tier, creating the effect 
of hierarchical levels through which the user must navigate while making 
selections at each level that will affect the choices available at 
subsequent levels. The query action will be implemented only after the 
value for the final level has been selected. A somewhat similar situation can be faced by the everyday PC user 
in accessing a simple personal computer management program, such

<CLAIMS>
A computer system including: 
   a display screen; and 

   a user interface mechanism for hierarchical menu selections 
characterised in that the interface mechanism includes: 

   a zoned menu control window including a first zone displaying 
indicators representing a plurality of selection levels in a menu 

hierarchy, and a second zone having contents comprising a displayed list 
of selection options for one of said selection levels; 

   means for entering an option selected from said displayed list of 
selection options; 

   means for refreshing the contents of the second zone by replacing 
the displayed list of selection options with a second list of selection 

options for a different selection level in response to entry of an option 
selected from said displayed list of selection options; and 

   registration means for implementing a computer task on selection of 
options for all selection levels in the menu hierarchy. 
A computer system, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the means for 
refreshing the contents of the second zone comprises replacing the 

displayed list of selection options with a second list of selection 
options for an inferior selection level in the menu hierarchy. 
A computer system, as claimed in Claim 1, further comprising: 
   means for verifying inferior selection levels in the menu hierarchy 

in response to entry of an option selected from said displayed list of 
selection options; 

   a task implementation indicator linkable to said registration 
means; and

 
   means for linking said task implementation indicator and 

registration means in response to a failure to verify inferior selection 
levels in the menu hierarchy, whereby to permit engagement of the 

registration means through the task implementation indicator. 
A computer system, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the indicators 
displayed in the first zone comprise a plurality of pushbuttons, each 

pushbutton correlating to a separate selection level in the menu 
hierarchy. 
A computer system, as claimed in Claim 4, wherein the pushbuttons 
are ranked from superior to inferior levels in the menu hierarchy. 
A computer system, as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the second field 
comprises a scrolled listbox. 
A method of assembling and displaying a hierarchical selection menu 
on a computer display screen, comprising the computer implemented steps 

of: 
   creating a menu control window having at least a first and a second 

zone; 
   displaying in the first zone of the control window, a plurality of 

indicators, each indicator representing a separate selection level in a 
menu hierarchy; 

   displaying in the second zone of the control window, a list of 
selection options for one of said selection levels in the menu hierarchy; 

and 
   in response to entry of an option from the displayed list of 

selection options, replacing the displayed list of selection options in 
the second zone with a second list of selection options for a different 

selection level in the menu hierarchy. 
A method, as claimed in Claim 7, further comprising, in response to 
entry of an option from the displayed list of selection options, the step 

of verifying inferior selection levels in the menu hierarchy, and 
 

displaying as the second list in the second zone, a list of selection 
options for an inferior selection level. 
A method, as claimed in Claim 8, further comprising the step of 
displaying options previously selected for any selection level in the 

menu hierarchy. 
A method of assembling and displaying a hierarchical listing of 
menu selections made by a computer user, said method comprising: 

   displaying a menu control window having multiple zones; 
   displaying within a first zone in said menu control window, a list 

of levels of the menu hierarchy; 
   displaying within a second zone in said menu control window, a list 

of selection options for a highest level not yet selected in the menu 
hierarchy; 

   displaying options previously selected for any selection level in 
the menu hierarchy; and 

   refreshing the second zone with a new listing of selection options 
from an immediately inferior selection level in the menu hierarchy in 

response to a user selection from the second zone. 
A process for implementing selections through a menu hierarchy, 
comprising the computer implemented steps of: 

   setting default selection values for all selection levels in the 
menu hierarchy; 

   creating a zoned menu control window; 
   displaying in a first zone of said control window a plurality of 

indicators, each indicator setting forth the default selection value for 
a separate selection level in the menu hierarchy; 

   setting a movable default emphasis on one superior selection level 
having selection options;

 
   displaying in a second zone a list of selection options for a 

selection level subject to the default emphasis; and 
   implementing a computer task in response to user registration of 

selection of options for all selection levels in the menu hierarchy.
