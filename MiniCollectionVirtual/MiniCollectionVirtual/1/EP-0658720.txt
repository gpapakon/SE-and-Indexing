<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lighting fixture (luminaire unit) which is provided in particular for strip light systems in industry. In order to achieve cost reduction in production, stockholding, logistics and assembly, the lighting fixture is designed in such a manner that a previously customary device carrier or lamp carrier and corresponding mechanical and electrical adaptors and fastening means are no longer necessary. The transit wirings, the electrical and electronic operational devices and holding facilities for a luminous means are accommodated and fastened in a supporting rail which is designed like a housing. A lower installation opening of the supporting rail, intended for installing devices, is covered by detachable light deflectors or reflector arrangements, or blank covers.

Lighting fixture, particularly for light band systems,
with a support rail (4) constructed for receiving electrical

operating devices (8) and having a downwardly
directed installation opening (16), with a lighting

means (6), which is held by means of holding devices
(10) on the support rail (4) and with a reflector arrangement

(20), which is cross-sectionally constructed
as a downwardly open U or trapezoidally and which is

fixable with the aid of fixing devices (24) to the support
rail (4),
characterized
 in

that the reflector arrangement (20) is provided between
the lateral faces (23) with a base face (22), which is

constructed for covering the installation opening (16)
of the support rail (4) and has at least two recesses

(26), which are constructed for the direct fixing of
the reflector arrangement (20) to the support rail (4)

in complementary manner to a pass-through toggle (29)
of a fixing element (28) of the fixing devices (24),
that each fixing element (28) has a cross-clip (13) for
retention on the support rail (4) and
that the support rail (4) is provided in the vicinity
of the installation opening (16) with longitudinal webs

(12) on which can be fitted or clipped and held in longitudinally
displaceable manner the cross-clips (13) of

the fixing devices (24) for the reflector arrangement
(20) and the holding devices (10) for the lighting

means (6) and the electrical operating devices (8).
Lighting fixture according to claim 1,
characterized
 in

that the recesses (26) in the base face (22) of the reflector
arrangement (20) are constructed as elongated

holes or keyhole bores and the fixing elements (28) are
constructed as snap closures.
Lighting fixture according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in

that the support rail (4) is constructed as a casing-like
profile and has an upper assembly surface (14) for

ceiling fitting or suspension.
Lighting fixture according to claim 3,
characterized
 in

that the support rail (4, 34) is made from galvanized
steel, has an almost U-shaped cross-section and is

coated on both sides and that the upper assembly surface
(14) is provided with a ceiling-side channel (17)

for through wiring.
Lighting fixture according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized
 in

that the support rail (4) is constructed as a multilength
support rail (34) for a single or multilamp and

multilength lighting fixture (30) and that to the
multilength support rail (34) are fixed by means of

holding devices (10) several lighting means (6) and
several reflectors arrangements (20) are fixed to the

multilength support rail (34), whose base face (22)
covers the installation opening (36) of the multilength

support rail (34). 
Lighting fixture according to claim 5,
characterized
 in

that the reflector arrangements (20) alternate with
a blank cover on the multilength support rail (34) and

that the blank cover can be clipped or fitted in or
fixed to the support rail (4) with a fixing element

(28) having a toggle (29) and cross-clip (13).
Lighting fixture according to claim 5 or 6,
characterized
 in

that several support rails (4, 34) of a single or
multilamp and a single or multilength lighting fixture

(2, 30) are arranged forming light bands with
the aid of connecting elements.
