<ABSTRACT>
A suspension system comprises a load beam (102) connecting a 
transducer element to a support member (102). The load beam has a 

stiffener member (106) which forms an enclosed interior chamber (192). 
The stiffener member adds rigidity to the suspension. The transducer 

element is connected to the load beam by a pivotable assembly (170, 110, 
202, 210, 214, 232). The pivotable assembly is comprised of a plurality 

of thin plate members which are stacked together. The result is a low 
profile suspension system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to transducer suspension systems
for disk drives and more particularly to a suspension system having a low
profile.Direct access storage devices (DASD), or disk drives, store
information on concentric tracks of a rotatable magnetic recording disk.
A magnetic head or transducer element is moved from track to track to
record and read the desired information. Typically, the magnetic head is
positioned on an air bearing slider which flies above the surface of the
disk as the disk rotates. In some recently proposed disk drives, the
slider (or carrier) rides on a liquid film or bearing on the disk. A
suspension assembly connects the slider to a rotary or linear actuator.
The suspension provides support for the slider.The suspension must meet several requirements. The suspension must
be flexible and provide a bias force in the vertical direction. This is
necessary to provide a compensating force to the lifting force of the air
bearing in order to keep the slider at the correct height above the disk.
Also, the vertical flexibility is needed to allow the slider to be loaded
and unloaded away from the disk. Another requirement of the suspension
is that it must provide a pivotal connection for the slider.
Irregularities in manufacture and operation may result in misalignment of
the slider. The slider is able to compensate for these problems by
pitching and/or rolling slightly to maintain the air bearing. Another
requirement of the suspension is that it must be rigid in the lateral
direction. This is needed to prevent the head from moving side to side,
which would result in the head reading the wrong track.Present suspension systems have problems in achieving low enough
pitch and roll stiffness for the air bearing flying height tolerances
while at the same time achieving high enough lateral stiffness to prevent
relative motion between the slider and the supporting end of the
suspension. Another requirement of suspensions is that they have a radial
frequency response that satisfies the requirements of the disk drive
system. A desirable radial frequency response consists of resonances
high in frequency and low in gain. The present suspension systems
typically use flanged load beams which exhibit undesirable low frequency
bending, torsion, and sway modes. This is especially true where the
flange height of the suspension is relatively small.Disk drives have become smaller in size while at the same time the
data storage capacity has greatly increased. Large capacity disk drives
