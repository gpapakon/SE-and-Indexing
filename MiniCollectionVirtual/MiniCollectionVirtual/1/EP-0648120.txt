<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a medicament for increasing bone mass in 
humans and other mammals, i.e., for the treatment of osteoporosis 
and related bone metabolic disorders. In particular, this 
invention relates to such a use by the 
administration of a low dose of a high potency phosphonate 
compound. A number of pathological conditions which can afflict humans 
and other mammals involve abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism. 
Such conditions may be divided into two broad categories: 
(1) Conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobilization 
of calcium and phosphate leading to general or 
specific bone loss, such as osteoporosis and Paget's 
disease, or excessively high calcium and phosphate 
levels in the fluids of the body, such as hypercalcemia 
of tumor origin. Such conditions are sometimes 
referred to herein as pathological hard tissue 
demineralizations. (2) Conditions which cause or result from deposition of 
calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body, such as 
arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. 
These conditions are sometimes referred to 
herein as pathological calcifications. The first category includes the most common metabolic bone 
disorder, osteoporosis; osteoporosis is a condition in which bone 
hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the development of new  
 
hard tissue. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the 
reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of skeletal 
tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding 
decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be 
subclassified as menopausal, senile, drug-induced (e.g. adrenocorticoid, 
as can occur in steroid therapy); disease-induced 
(arthritic and tumor), etc.; however, the manifestations are 
essentially the same. In general, there are two types of osteoporosis: primary 
and secondary. "Secondary osteoporosis" is the result of a 
separate disease process or agent. However, approximately 90% of 
all osteoporosis cases are "primary osteoporosis". Such primary 
osteoporosis includes postmenopausal osteoporosis, disuse osteoporosis 
age-associated osteoporosis (affecting a majority of 
individuals over the age of 70 to 80), and idiopathic osteoporosis 
affecting middle-aged and younger men and women. For some osteoporotic individuals, the loss of bone tissue 
is sufficiently great so as to cause mechanical failure of the 
bone structure. Bone fractures often occur, for example, in the 
hip and spine of women suffering from postmenopausal
