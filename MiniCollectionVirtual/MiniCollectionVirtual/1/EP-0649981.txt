<ABSTRACT>
A throttle mechanism (10) for an engine of a 
motor vehicle comprising a throttle body (12) 

securable between an air horn (24) and a manifold (22) 
and having an inner wall (36) defining a bore (38) 

extending therethrough, the bore having a longitudinal 
axis (X) an outer wall, a first surface (98) 

connectable with the air horn, and a second surface 
(98') connectable with the manifold, the first and 

second surfaces being planar and substantially 
parallel to one another; a shaft (14) extending across 

the bore and having a longitudinal axis (Y) 
substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 

of the bore, the shaft being rotatably mounted in the 
inner wall of the throttle body for pivotal movement 

about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, at least one 
end (42) of the shaft passing through the inner wall 

to extend beyond the outer wall; a flap valve (16) 
secured to the shaft inside the bore for movement 

between a fully open position and a substantially 
closed position on rotation of the shaft; means 

(18,20) secured to the said at least one end of the 
shaft adjacent the outer wall for rotating the shaft; 

and fluid heating means (34) comprising a recess (96) 
formed in the first surface, a substantially identical 

recess (96') formed in the second surface, and an 
inlet pipe (104) and an outlet pipe (106) mounted on 

the air horn or the manifold and fluidly connecting 
with one of the recesses by way of bores (100,102) 

passing through the air horn or the manifold to allow 
fluid to pass through the inlet pipe into the recess 

and out through the outlet pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a throttle
mechanism for an engine of a motor vehicle.There are numerous designs of throttle
mechanisms for engines which are well known to those
skilled in the art. These known throttle mechanisms
basically comprise a throttle body with a bore
therethrough, a shaft extending across the bore and
having a flap valve secured thereto, and means for
rotating the shaft relative to the throttle body.
Generally, the problem associated with these known
designs is that for each design of engine, and/or for
each application of the throttle mechanism, a
different design of throttle mechanism is required in
terms of the layout of the throttle mechanism and/or
the layout of the elements attached to, or forming
part of, the throttle mechanism.US-A-3 916 859 discloses a throttle mechanism in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1. FR-A-2 606 115 discloses a throttle mechanism with a different arrangement for fluid heating.It is an object of the present invention to
overcome one or more of these disadvantages.To this end, a throttle mechanism in
accordance with the present invention comprises an air horn and/or a manifold a
throttle body securable between the air horn and the
manifold and having an inner wall defining a bore
extending therethrough, the bore having a longitudinal
axis, an outer wall, a first surface connectable with
the air horn, and a second surface connectable with
the manifold, the first and second surfaces being
planar and substantially parallel to one another; a
shaft extending across the bore and having a
longitudinal axis substantially perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the bore, the shaft being
rotatably mounted in the inner wall of the throttle
body for pivotal movement about the longitudinal axis
of the shaft, at least one end of the shaft passing
through the inner wall to extend beyond the outer
wall; a flap valve secured to the shaft inside the 
bore for movement between a fully open position and a
substantially closed position on rotation of the
shaft; and fluid heating means; the throttle mechanisme is characterised by means secured to the said at least one end of
the shaft adjacent the outer wall for rotating the
shaft; and by fluid heating means comprising a recess
formed in the first surface, a substantially identical
recess formed in the second surface, and an inlet pipe
and an outlet pipe mounted on the air horn or the
manifold and fluidly connecting with one of the
recesses by way of bores passing through the air horn
or the manifold to allow fluid
