<ABSTRACT>
A crimp height adjustment mechanism (4) is 
disclosed for use in a crimping machine having an anvil 

(42) and a ram (44) carrying a crimping die (46). The 
ram is secured against rotation and guided for 

reciprocal movement along a ram axis (R-R) for moving 
the crimping die toward and away from the anvil. A 

drive member (52) is connected for reciprocating the 
ram. The adjustment mechanism includes a first member 

(10) fixed with respect to the anvil and having a first 
threaded portion (12) of a first thread pitch extending 

along an adjustment axis parallel to the ram axis. A 
second member (20) has a second threaded portion (22) 

coaxial to the first threaded portion. The second 
threaded portion has a second thread pitch which differs 

from the first thread pitch. The second member is 
secured against rotation and coupled to move the ram 

linearly along the ram axis. A third member (30) has 
both a third threaded portion (32) which is threadedly 

engaged with the first threaded portion, and a fourth 
threaded portion (34) which is threadedly engaged with 

the second threaded portion. The third member is 
rotatable about an adjustment axis (A-A) so as to change 

an extent of engagement with the first and second 
threaded portions. Rotation of the third member about 

the adjustment axis produces a linear movement of the 
second member which is equal to a number of rotations of 

the third member multiplied by a difference between the 
first and second pitches.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to a machine for crimping a
terminal to an electrical conductor, and more
particularly, to a mechanism which enables extremely
fine adjustment of the height of a crimped terminal
produced in such a machine.Machines are known for crimping a terminal to an
electrical conductor such as a wire or cable. Such
machines generally employ a ram which is reciprocally
movable with respect to a fixed anvil. The ram carries
a crimping die which cooperates with the anvil to crimp
a terminal therebetween. In a crimping operation, the
ram is driven through a working stroke to deform the
terminal and tightly engage the conductor within the
terminal to form a crimped connection.The crimp height, i.e., the height or vertical
dimension of the terminal after deformation, is a good
indicator of quality of the crimped connection. In
order to produce a secure and reliable crimped
connection, the terminal must be deformed around the
conductor until the height of the terminal is below a
certain maximum. Terminals and conductors come in a
variety of types and sizes, and the maximum is
predetermined for many different combinations of
terminals and conductors. Based on pullout tests which
measure the tension required to separate crimped
terminals of various crimp heights from their associated
conductors, the maximum crimp height for a particular
combination of terminal and conductor can be calculated.
Ideal crimp heights are somewhat below the maximum so as
to provide a safety factor against pullout while
avoiding excessive deformation of the terminal which may
in itself destroy the crimped connection and requires
greater energy to produce.A crimping machine which has been set up to produce
a certain crimp height may require adjustment after some 
time in operation. The need for adjustment may be due
to wear of components in the machine, non-uniformity of
terminals being crimped, or a change in the type or size
of the terminal or conductor. Various mechanisms for
adjusting crimp height are known. These mechanisms
provide either a means to vary the working stroke of the
ram or a means to adjust a rest position of the ram with
respect to the anvil, thereby adjusting a dimension from
the crimping die to the anvil when the ram is at the
fullest extent of its working stroke. The known
adjustment mechanisms are somewhat coarse, generally
being unable to achieve crimp height adjustments in
increments smaller than 0.00254 cm (.001 inch).There is a need for a mechanism that provides
extremely fine crimp

A crimp height adjustment mechanism (4) in a crimping
machine having a frame (58), an anvil (42) and a ram (44) carrying

a crimping die (46), the ram (42) being secured against rotation and
guided for reciprocal movement along a ram axis (R-R) for moving

the crimping die (46) toward and away from the anvil (42) between
remote and proximate positions 
with respect to the anvil (42), a
bellcrank (66) pivotally attached to said adjustment mechanism (4) at a fulcrum

(74), said bellcrank (66) having one end coupled to a drive member
(52) for pivoting said bellcrank (66) and the other end pivotally

attached to a toggle link (68) interconnected to said ram (44), so
that when said bellcrank (66) is pivoted about said fulcrum (74) said

ram (44) undergoes said reciprocal movement, the crimping die (46)
being adapted to cooperate with the anvil (42) for crimping a

terminal when the crimping die (46) is in the proximate position,

a first member (10) fixed with respect to the anvil (42) and having
a first threaded portion (12) extending along an adjustment axis (A-A)

parallel to the ram axis (R-R), the first threaded portion (12)
having a first thread pitch;
a second member (20) fixed with respect to said fulcrum (74) and

means enabling adjustable movement thereof;
wherein, upon rotation of the third member (30) the second member

(A-A) thereby producing a corresponding linear movement of the
ram (44) along the ram axis (R-R);
wherein actuating rotation of the third member (30) about the
adjustment axis (A-A) produces said linear movement of the second

member (20) and said fulcrum which is equal to a number of
