<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for recovering the lecithin contained in oil and lecithin mixtures by extraction with an extracting agent containing at least one hydrocarbon. The extraction with one or several C3- or C4-hydrocarbons is carried out in such conditions that the extracting agent forms with the lecithin a low viscosity solution and the extraction mixture decomposes into an oil-rich liquid phase and a lecithin-rich liquid phase. Both phases are separated and substantially lecithin-free oil is recovered by separating the extracting agent from the oil-rich phase and substantially oil-free pure lecithin is recovered by separating the extracting agent from the lecithin-rich phase.

Process for recovering lecithin from oil and lecithin-containing 
mixtures by extraction using an extracting 

agent which consists of one or more hydrocarbons, 

characterised in that
 the extracting agent is selected 
from the group comprising a hydrocarbon having 3 carbon 

atoms, an unbranched hydrocarbon having 4 carbon atoms, a 
branched hydrocarbon having 4 carbon atoms and mixtures 

thereof, in that the extraction is carried out at a 
pressure between 1 and 8 MPa and a temperature between 20 

and 100°C under conditions under which the extracting 
agent forms a low-viscosity solution with the lecithin, 

and two liquid phases are formed in the system 
lecithin/oil/hydrocarbon, of which one phase is enriched 

in oil and the other phase is enriched in lecithin, in 
that the two phases are separated and essentially 

lecithin-free oil is recovered from the oil-enriched 
phase and essentially oil-free pure lecithin is recovered 

from the lecithin-enriched phase by separating off the 
extracting agent. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the extracting agent is selected from the group 

consisting of propane, butane and mixtures thereof. 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that 
propane or a mixture of propane with up to 25 wt.% of 

butane is used as extracting agent. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the extraction is carried out at a 

pressure between 3 and 5 MPa.  
 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the extraction is carried out at a 

temperature between 30 and 85°C, particularly between 50 
and 70°C. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that natural or chemically modified 

lecithin-containing mixtures of vegetable or animal 
origin, Preferably of vegetable origin, which also 

contain oils or fats, particularly vegetable oils from 
oil seeds and cereal seeds, such as soya beans, rape, 

sunflower seeds, maize, hemp and linseed, are used as 
starting product. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the extraction is carried out in a 

separating column (extraction column), preferably 
continuously in a counter-current process, wherein a 

lecithin-rich extract is withdrawn at the column sump and 
an oil-rich extract is withdrawn at the column head. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that a 
temperature profile is produced in the separating column 

such that the temperature at the head of the column is 10 
to 80°C, preferably 20 to 70°C, and particularly 30 to 

50°C, above that of the column sump. 
Process according to claim 8, characterised in than 
the temperature of the refined product is 20 to 60°C when 

leaving the column sump and that of the extract is 60 to 
100°C when leaving the column head. 
Process according to at least one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterized in that the oil-rich extract withdrawn at 

the column head of the extraction column is transferred  
 

to a regenerating column and is separated there into 
extracting agent and product by reducing pressure and/or 

increasing temperature. 
Process according to claim 10, characterised in that 
some of the product obtained at the column sump of the 

regenerating column is returned to the extraction column, 
preferably to its head, as reflux. 
Process according to at least one of claims 7 to 9, 
characterised in that the lecithin-rich phase withdrawn 

at the column sump is separated into essentially oil-free 
pure lecithin and extracting agent by reducing pressure 

and/or increasing temperature. 
Process according to one or both of claims 10 and 12, 
characterised in that the extracting agent separated off 

by reducing pressure and/or increasing temperature is 
recompressed and/or condensed in order to be returned if 

required.
