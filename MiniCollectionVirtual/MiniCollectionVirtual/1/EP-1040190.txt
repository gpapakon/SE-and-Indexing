<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a serine proteinase inhibitor, characterised in that it has a domain with four cysteines, with a sequence of 13 amino acids located between the first cysteine and the second cysteine, a sequence of 18 amino acids located between the second cysteine and the third cysteine and a sequence of 2 amino acids located between the third cysteine and the fourth cysteine. The inventive serine proteinase inhibitors can be used for treating inflammatory diseases such as acute or chronic cervical inflammations or tonsillitis, and for preventing pulmonary emphysema.
