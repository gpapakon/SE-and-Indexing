<ABSTRACT>
A support and positioning apparatus (10) for 
supporting and positioning a wafer (12), substrate or the 

like in a plasma assisted chemical etching process. 
Surround components (14, 16, 18, 20) positioned around the 

substrate (12) are comprised of substantially pure 
magnesium or are aluminum coated with a magnesium fluoride 

coating such that as a plasma tool associated with the 
plasma etching process traverses the edge of the substrate 

(12), the plasma etching environment generated from a 
fluorine containing feed gas emitted from the plasma tool 

does not significantly erode the surround components (14, 
16, 18, 20) or cause contamination of the substrate (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a surround 
for use in a plasma etching process and, more 
particularly, to a noncorrosive and noncontaminating 
magnesium surround for use in a plasma assisted chemical 
etch process. Plasma assisted chemical etch (PACE) is a known 
etching process by which a plasma generates chemically 
reactive species from a gas, such as a fluorine containing 
gas (e.g., CF₄, SF₆). A well known application of plasma 
etching is etching patterns into semiconductor device 
wafers in which a photo-lithographically defined pattern 
acts as a resist to the plasma etch. Another application 
is to modify a substrate by moving a small confined plasma 
over the surface of the substrate. Other applications 
include silicon-on-insulator (SOI) thinning, thickness 
variations of a substrate such as flattening of silicon 
wafers, and correcting the figure of an optical surface. 
For an example of SOI thinning, see U.S. patent 
application Ser. No. 07/696,897 filed 5/7/91, and for an 
example of alteration of an optical surface see U.S. 
Patent No. 4,668,366 issued to Zarowin. During the PACE process, an article being 
modified is secured to a platform within a vacuum chamber  
 
associated with a plasma reactor, and a plasma tool is 
positioned relative to the article. A feed gas (e.g., CF₄, 
SF₆) is introduced by the plasma tool into the plasma 
reactor chamber where the plasma generates chemically 
reactive species from the feed gas. The chemically 
reactive species interact with the substrate surface to 
form volatile by-products which etch the surface of the 
article. The chemical interaction rate may be increased 
by a flow of plasma generated excited species, low energy 
ions and excited neutral species to the surface. A plasma etching system for modifying the 
substrate by the PACE process typically has three major 
components. These components include a device to measure 
the thickness profile of the article which is to be 
modified, computational hardware and software to provide 
a plasma tool velocity/position map based on the measured 
starting layer thickness profile, the desired thickness 
profile, and the plasma etch parameters which are to be 
used, and material removal hardware to execute the plasma 
tool motion and make the layer profile modifications. When making a correction to the surface of the 
article by the PACE process, the plasma tool is scanned 
over the surface in relation to a dwell-time map that is 
calculated from a map of the corrections to be made and 
the
