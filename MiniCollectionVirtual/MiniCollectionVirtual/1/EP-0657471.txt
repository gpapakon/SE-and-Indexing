<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to immunotherapy strategies 
for the treatment of malignancies. The present immunotherapy 

strategies have gangliosides as a target. Gangliosides are 
glycosphingolipids which are present on normal cells and on 

malignant cells. On malignant cells they are more abundant and 
expressed in a different organization and conformation. The 

present invention provides antibodies which recognize these 
gangliosides, which antibodies are specific, have recurrent 

idiotypes and have value as immunoregulators. The invention 
further provides anti-idiotypic antibodies against anti-ganglioside 

antibodies. These are useful in vaccination 
strategies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the field of
Immunology, particularly with the generation and selection of
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against gangliosides (Abls),
which antibodies are specific, have recurrent idiotypes and
have value as immunoregulators of the immune response against
these antigens. It further relates to obtaining anti-idiotypic
mAbs (Ab2s) generated by the immunization with said anti-ganglioside
mAbs.Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids that contain sialic
acid and which are expressed in the majority of the mammalian
cell membranes. Although these antigens are present in normal
tissues, they can be found in larger quantities and expressed
in a different organization and conformation on the surface of
malignant cells (Hakomori, S. (1985), Cancer Res. 45, 2405-2414;
Miraldi, F. (1989) Seminars in Nuclear Medicine XIX,
282-294; Hamilton, et al (1993) Int. J. Cancer 53, 1-8).Some mAbs are capable of recognising gangliosides only
when they are present in high density on the cell surface e.g.
mAbs against GM3 (Nores, G.A. et al (1987) J Immunol 139,
3171-3176; Dohi, I. et al (1988), Cancer Res. 48, 5680-5685).Normal adult tissues only contain NeuAc and not NeuGc-containing
gangliosides.Some human tumours including melanomas, colorectal
cancer, retinoblastoma, and non-seminal germinal cell tumours
have been reported to have N-glycolyl neuraminic acid
containing gangliosides but it constitutes less than 0.05% of
the total sialic acid contents (Higachi, H. et al (1984) Jpn J
Cancer Res (Gann) 75, 1025-1029; Higachi, H. et al (1985)
Cancer Res. 45, 3796-3802; Hirabayashi, I. et al (1987) Jpn J
Cancer Res (Gann) 78, 1614-1620; Higachi, H. et al (1988) Jpn 
J Cancer Res (Gann) 79, 952-956; Miyake, M. et al (1990)
Cancer 65, 499-505).Other authors have shown that human mAbs against these
antigens did not recognise any of the colorectal tumours or
melanomas studied (Furukawa, K. et al (1988) J Biol. Chem.
265, 18507-18512).Studies of ganglioside contents in breast tumours have
demonstrated that NeuGc-containing gangliosides constitute
approximately 5-11% of the total ganglioside content.Gangliosides are not good immunogens and in order to
elicit an immune response they must be coupled to proteins or
incorporated to liposomes or the Salmonella minnesota R595
strain. One characteristic of the antibody response to these
antigens is that the immunoglobulin class produced is mainly
IgM.Although IgG anti-gangliosides antibodies can be found in
humans and mice, the T cell co-operation seems to be
