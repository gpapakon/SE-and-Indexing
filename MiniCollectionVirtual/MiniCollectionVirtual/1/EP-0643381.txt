<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording drive includes a plurality of magnetic 
heads (2) each employing a magnetoresistive sensor for 

the purpose of averaging the time required for sense currents 
to be caused to flow through the respective magnetoresistive 

sensors to shorten the longest reproducing time and to suppress 
the degradation of the characteristics due to the electromigration, 

thereby improving the reliability of the magnetic 
recording drive. The drive includes circuits (6, 8) for 

averaging the useful life depending on the currents flowing 
through the respective magnetoresistive sensors among the 

plurality of magnetic heads. The time required for the sense 
current flowing through one MR reproducing head is thus 

greatly shortened. Therefore, the levels of outputs of the MR 
reproducing heads can be increased without reducing the reliability. 

Thus, the reliability of the magnetic recording 
drive can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
a magnetic recording drive,
such as a magnetic disc drive, a magnetic
tape drive, and a magnetic floppy disc drive.A magnetoresistive (MR) sensor operates to
detect the leakage magnetic field from the recorded
magnetic transition by utilizing the fact that the
resistivity of the sensor depends on the leakage
magnetic field. Therefore, when the magnitude of the
sense current which flows through the sensor is
increased, the large reproduced output signal is
obtained irrespective of the relative speed between the
head and the media such as disc and tape. For this
reason, the magnetoresistive sensor has been widely used
in the reproducing heads of the high density magnetic
recording drives. However, in order to obtain the large
output, the magnitude of the current (the sensor
current), which flows through the magnetoresistive (MR)
sensor, needs to be increased. On the other hand, since
the sense current flows through a very thin MR sensor
layer, it is necessary to prevent the disconnection due
to the electromigration and the like. For this purpose,
heretofore, only during the operation for reproducing 
the recorded signals, the sense current was caused to
flow through the MR sensor.Along with the promotion of high density in
the magnetic disc drive, it is desired to improve the
head sensitivity to secure the read operation of the
reproduced output. Thus, if the large reproduced output
is intended to be obtained by increasing the sense
current which flows through the MR sensor, since in
general, the current density of the sense current is so
large as to be 107 A/cm2 or so, in terms of the useful
life of the sensor, there arises the problem that the
sensor is brokendown due to the electromigration or the
acceleration of the electromigration due to the
temperature rise.In addition, for the purpose of increasing the
track density, in order to improve the head positioning
accuracy, the embedded sector servo utilizing the
positioning signal on the data surface has been widely
used. Then, if in this method, the magnetoresistive
(MR) sensor is used for reproducing both the recorded
read-write (R-W) data and the positioning signal, the
following problem will arise. In the embedded sector
servo method including the reproducing operation,
the positioning signal is always reproduced which
is recorded in each head portion of each portion
which is called the sector and is concentrically
distributed in a fan shape on the magnetic disc.
Therefore, after the reproducing of R/W
