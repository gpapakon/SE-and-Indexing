<ABSTRACT>
Described is a gene situated in the region of the neuroblastoma consensus deletion 1p36.2-p36.1 and which codes for a helix-loop-helix protein with the designation HEIR-1. The gene is affected significantly by allelic tumour deletions in neuroblastomas and correlates inversely both with N-myc overexpression in tumours and with N-myc expression in normal development. The cDNA and antibodies coding for HEIR-1 are used for the diagnosis of pathological conditions associated with aberrations in the region of the neuroblastoma consensus deletion.

contains the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 from 

position 1 to position 443, in the 5' direction from the 
start ATG. 
cDNA derived from a transcript of DNA according to 
claim 1, characterised in that it contains the sequence 

shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 coding for HEIR-1, including the 
degenerate variants thereof and fragments thereof which 

recognise an Apa I restriction fragment length 
polymorphism.

Process for diagnosing pathological conditions in 
humans, associated with an aberration in chromosome 

region lp36p12, characterised in that a sample is  
 

investigated for the presence of DNA according to claim 
1, the RNA transcribed thereby or the expressed gene 

product. 
Process according to claim 9, characterised in that 
DNA is isolated from the tissue to be investigated and 

from healthy tissue from the same individual, the 
samples are digested with restriction enzyme(s) and 

hybridised with cDNA according to claim 3 or with 
fragments thereof which are homologous in terms of their 

hybridisation properties under the conditions selected.
