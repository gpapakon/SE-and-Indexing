<ABSTRACT>
An energy regulator (200) comprises a pivotally mounted, U-shaped bimetallic element (232), one limb (210) of which acts as an actuator for a microswitch arm (218), which is pivotally mounted to one end thereof. The other limb (234) acts as a compensating bimetal and having a cam follower (238) which engages a control surface (240) of a control cam (206). The stressed C spring (222) of the microswitch acts to bias the element (232) into a pivotal mount (252) in the housing, to bias the contact arm (218) onto a pivotal seat (244) on the end of the actuator (210) and also generates a moment to bias the cam follower (238) into engagement with its control surface (230).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to energy regulators of the kind descreibed in the preamble of claim 1
for controlling the supply of electrical energy to
electrical loads such as cooker hot plates or grills.Typically, energy regulators comprise a snap-acting
microswitch having a set of switch contacts arrangeable
in the electrical supply circuit to the electrical load,
a snap-acting switch contact arm, operatively associated
with a bimetallic actuator for operating the switch
contacts, and electrically energisable heating means
associated with the bimetallic actuator. In such
constructions, electrical power is initially supplied to
the load and to the heating means which may be connected
either in parallel or in series with the load. The
heating means heats the bimetallic actuator, causing it
to deform to the point where it causes snap-movement of
the contact arm to open the switch contacts and
interrupt the power supply to both the load and the
heating means. The bimetallic actuator then cools and
deforms in the opposite direction to the point where the
contact arm undergoes reverse snap-action to close the
contacts once more, whereupon the cycle recommences.
Thus such regulators operate on the principle of
supplying power to the load over a proportion of an
operating cycle, the proportion being determined
typically by the initial position of a free end of the
bimetallic actuator which actuates the contact arm, such
initial position being settable by control means coupled
in use to a user actuated control member e.g. a knob.
The bimetallic actuator may, for example, form an
integral part of a bimetallic element which further
includes an ambient compensating bimetal through which
the control means may be coupled to the actuator whereby
the initial position of the free end thereof is
unaffected by changes in ambient temperature. In energy regulators of the kind described above,
it has been standard practice to provide separate
mountings for the compensating bimetal and/or the
bimetallic actuator and/or the microswitch contact arm
and this results in an unnecessarily high number of
components. Furthermore, there is often the need for a
complicated linkage means for transmitting the actuating
movement of the bimetallic actuator to the microswitch.
Thus, known arrangements tend to be complicated and
relatively costly.US-A-2,906,839 discloses an energy regulator for
regulating the supply of electrical energy to a load in
the form of an electrical heating device comprising a
bimetallic actuator mounted at one
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An energy regulator for regulating the supply of
electrical energy to a load in the form of an electrical

heating device comprising a bimetallic actuator (6;210)
mounted at one end in a housing (2;202), said actuator

having associated therewith an electrically energisable
heating means (7;101;260) which in use is connected

electrically in series or in parallel with said load, a
microswitch (5;208) comprising a fixed electrical

contact (9;214) and a movable electrical contact (10;
216) mounted on a switch contact arm (11;218), and a

stressed spring means (15;222) for moving said switch
contact arm with a snap action between respective

contacts open and closed positions, the arrangement
being such that in use the heating means heats the

bimetallic actuator, causing it to deform to the point
where it causes snap-movement of the contact arm to open

the switch contacts and interrupt the power supply to
both the load and the heating means whereafter the

bimetallic actuator then cools and deforms in the
opposite direction to the point where the contact arm

undergoes reverse snap-action to close the contacts once
more, the regulator further comprising an ambient

compensating bimetal (23;234) and control means for
adjusting the operating cycle of the microswitch, said

control means comprising a rotatable cam surface (51;
240) operatively coupled to a control member (3;204),

and a cam follower (50;238) engaging said cam surface,
movement of the cam follower in response to rotation of

the control member and cam surface being effective to
vary the distance through which the free end of the

bimetallic actuator must deflect under the heating
effect of the heating means to cause the switch contact

arm to operate to open the contacts, characterised in
that the switch contact arm (11;218) is mounted at its

end remote from said contact to the free end (21;230) of 
the bimetallic actuator (6;210) remote from the end of

the actuator mounted in the housing, such that it is
arranged in a generally face to face relationship with

said actuator with one component overlying the other,

of its free end, which displacement is transmitted to
the end of the switch contact arm mounted thereto.
