<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optical recording medium includes a 
readout layer has in-plane magnetization at room 

temperature and in which a transition occurs from 
in-plane magnetization to perpendicular magnetization 

when temperature thereof is raised, and a recording 
layer for recording thereon information. The 

composition of the readout layer varies in a direction 
perpendicular to the surface thereof, and in the 

readout layer, the Co density on the light incident 
side is higher than the Co density on the interface 

between the readout layer and the recording layer. 
Therefore, the Curie temperature on the reproducing 

light incident side of the readout layer is high and 
the the polar Kerr rotation angle in reproducing 

increases, thereby achieving improvements in a 
reproducing signal quality. On the other hand, since 

the Curie temperature on the interface is low, the 
shift of the threshold temperature at which a 

transition occurs from in-plane to perpendicular by the 
magnetic interaction between the layers can be 

suppressed, thereby achieving a high quality 
reproducing signal without changing the laser power 

required for reproduction very much.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magneto-optical
recording medium such as a magneto-optical disk, a
magneto-optical tape, a magneto-optical card, etc., for
use in a magneto-optical recording device, and also
relates to a manufacturing method thereof.Research and development on magneto-optical disks
have been intensified as being rewritable optical
disks, and some of the magneto-optical disks have been
already practically used as external memory designed
for computers.In the magneto-optical disk, a magnetic thin film 
with perpendicular magnetization is used as a recording
medium, and light is used in recording and reproducing.
Thus, compared with a floppy disk or a hard disk
wherein a magnetic thin film with in-plane
magnetization is used, the magneto-optical disk has a
larger recording capacity.Recently, a magneto-optical recording medium which
includes a recording layer composed of a magnetic layer
having a multi-layer structure, which enables a
reproduction of a recording bit with a size
significantly smaller than the size of the light spot,
i.e., a magneto-optical recording medium which enables
a reproduction of high resolution has been proposed.For example, Japanese Examined Patent Publication
No. 81717/1993 (Tokukohei 5-81717) discloses a
magneto-optical recording medium which includes a
recording layer for recording information
magneto-optically and a readout layer has in-plane
magnetization at room temperature, and in which a
transition occurs from in-plane magnetization to
perpendicular magnetization when the temperature
thereof is raised.The magneto-optical recording medium enables
reproduction of high resolution for the reasons
explained with reference to Fig. 22 through Fig. 24. As shown in Fig. 22, the magneto-optical disk is
mainly composed of a substrate 101 whereon a
transparent dielectric layer 102, a readout layer 103,
a recording layer 104, a protective layer 105 and an
overcoat layer 106 are laminated in this order.As shown in the magnetic phase diagram of Fig. 23,
a composition range where the rare-earth transition
metal alloy used in the readout layer 103 has a
perpendicular magnetization (shown by A in the figure)
is extremely narrow. This is because perpendicular
magnetization appears only in the vicinity of a
compensating composition (shown by P in the figure)
where the magnetic moment of the rare-earth metal and
the magnetic moment of the transition metal balance
with one another.The respective magnetic moments of the rare-earth
metal and the transition metal have mutually
