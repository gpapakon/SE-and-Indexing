<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of alkyl tertiary-alkyl 
ether from tertiary alkyl alcohol and primary alcohol in 

the presence of a catalyst, characterized in that the 
catalyst is a heterogenous catalyst comprising an 

alkylsulfonic acid covalently bonded to an oxide of Group 
III or Group IV of the Periodic Table. The process is 

suited to the production of methyl tert-butyl ether. The 
oxide is preferably silica gel, the acid preferably 

propylsulfonic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the synthesis of alkyl t-alkyl 
ether using alkylsulfonic acid-modified oxide 
catalysts. In particular, this invention concerns an 
improved process for preparing methyl tertiary butyl ether 
(MTBE) by the reaction of tertiary butanol and methanol in 
the presence of a catalyst comprising an alkylsulfonic 
acid-modified oxide. MTBE has been generated in up to 40 
percent concentration in the crude product effluent and 
product phase separation is in evidence at temperatures of 
160°C or greater. It is known to those skilled in the art that ethers, 
including unsymmetrical ethers, may be prepared by 
reacting an alcohol with another alcohol to form the 
desired product. The reaction mixture, containing 
catalyst and/or condensing agent may be separated and 
further treated to permit attainment of the  
 
desired product. Such further treatment commonly includes one or 
more distillation operations. Alkyl tertiary-alkyl ethers, 
particularly methyl tert-butyl ether, are finding increasing use as a 
blending component in high octane gasoline as the current 
gasoline additives based on lead and manganese are phased out. 
Currently all commercial processes for the manufacture of methyl 
tert-butyl ether are based upon the liquid-phase reaction of 
isobutylene and methanol (Eq. 1), catalyzed by a cationic ionexchange 
resin with an organic polymer backbone (see, for 
example: Hydrocarbon Processing, Oct. 1984, p. 63; Oil and Gas 
J., Jan. 1, 1979, p. 76; Chem. Economics Handbook-SRI, Sept. 
1986, p. 543-7051P). The cationic ion-exchange resins used in 
MTBE synthesis normally have the sulfonic acid functionality and 
a cross-linked styrene-divinylbenzene polymer backbone (see: J. 
Tejero, J. Mol. Catal., 42 (1987) 257; C. Subramamam et al., Can. 
J. Chem. Eng., 65 (1987) 613). 
With the expanding use of MTBE as an acceptable 
gasoline additive, a growing problem is the availability of raw 
materials. Historically, the critical raw material is  
 
isobutylene (Oil and Gas J., June 8, 1987, p. 55). It would be 
advantageous, therefore, to have a process to make MTBE that does 
not require isobutylene as a building block. It would be 
advantageous to have an efficient process for making MTBE by 
reaction of methanol with tertiary butyl alcohol, since t-butanol 
(tBA) is readily available commercially through isobutane 
oxidation. In U.S. Patent No. 4,822,921, to Texaco Chemical Co., 
there is described a method for preparing alkyl tertiary alkyl 
ethers which comprises reacting a C1-C6
