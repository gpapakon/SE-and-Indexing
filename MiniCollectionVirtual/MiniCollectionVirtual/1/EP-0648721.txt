<ABSTRACT>
Medium-chain olefins containing as impurities 2-alkyl substituted isomers 
having a close boiling point are purified by (i) passing over a solid acid 

catalyst under mild conditions to selectively double-bond isomerise said 
impurities, and (ii) separating said isomerised olefins by distillation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the purification of medium-chain olefins,
more particularly of medium chain alpha-olefins.Industrial purification of medium-chain olefins is usually performed by
distillation. However, certain isomers, particularly the 2-ethyl substituted
alpha-olefins, do not have a boiling point sufficiently different from that
of the alpha-olefin to be purified, and distillation is thus not fully
efficient. For example, 2-ethyl-1-pentene has a boiling point of 94°C while
1-heptene has a boiling point of 93.6°C.Medium-chain alpha-olefins find many uses in industry. The most important
ones are the synthesis of alcohols or aldehydes by hydroformylation ("oxo
synthesis"), the production of synthetic lubricants by oligomerisation, and
the production of copolymers with short-chain olefins.For such uses, 2-alkyl substituted alpha-olefins can be an undesired impurity
in the linear alpha-olefin whenever it is capable of reacting to give
undesired side effects or side products. For example, aldehydes obtained by
oxo synthesis can be converted into synthetic fatty acids which are used in
the production of lubricants; however, lubricant production requires highly
linear acids.There is thus a need in the art for a process for the purification of medium-chain
alpha-olefins, by removing therefrom the undesired isomers,
particularly those that cannot efficiently be removed by distillation.GB-934738-A (equivalent to DE-1214666-A) discloses a process for the
isomerisation of mono-olefins having the double bond attached to a tertiary
carbon atom in the presence of an acidic silica-alumina catalyst having ion
exchange characteristics after it has been modified by treatment with a base.FR-2250729 discloses a process for the isomerisation of tertiary olefins on
sulfonated ion exchange resins.However, US-5237120-A is evidence that conversion of 1-olefins to 2-olefins
is obtained by double-bond isomerisation on a zeolite whose surface has been
at least partially deactivated for acid-catalysed reactions. It is an object of this invention to provide a process for the purification
of medium-chain alpha-olefins.Another object of the invention is to remove from medium-chain alpha-olefins
the isomer 2-alkyl substituted alpha-olefins.Still another object of the invention is to remove from medium-chain
alpha-olefins those isomers whose boiling point is very close to that of said
alpha-olefins.Yet another object of the invention is to selectively double-bond isomerise
2-alkyl substituted alpha-olefin isomers in
