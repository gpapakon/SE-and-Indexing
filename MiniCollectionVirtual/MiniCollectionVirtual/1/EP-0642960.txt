<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for automatically controlling the angular velocity (speed) of a motor vehicle wheel under braking. The process is characterised in that it consists in determining the angular velocity of each wheel, calculating the mean of these angular velocities, deducing a calculated speed of the vehicle Vcal using the formula:            Vcal= omega  Lo where  omega  is the mean angular velocity and Lo is the theoretical developed length of each wheel; and determining the reference angular velocity of the wheel in question using the formula:             omega i = Vcal DIVIDED Li  where Li is the developed length of the wheel. The invention finds an application in anti-lock braking systems for motor vehicles.

A method for controlling the angular speed of a motor vehicle wheel during a 
braking phase, in which the reference angular speed is determined as a function 

of the speed of the vehicle, characterised in that it comprises the following steps: 

a) detecting the angular speed of each wheel of the vehicle; 
b) calculating the mean of these angular speeds; 
c) deducing therefrom a calculated vehicle speed V
cal
 using the formula: 

V
cal
 = ω L
o
 
where ω is the mean angular speed and L
o
 is the theoretical developed 
length of each wheel; and 
d) determining the reference angular speed of the wheel in question using the 
formula: 


ω
i
 = 
V
cal
L
i
 
where L
i
 is the developed length of the wheel. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that it comprises the following 
steps, performed before step a) outside periods of braking and intended to 

determine the developed length L
i
 of each wheel: 

e) detecting the angular speed ω
i
 of each wheel of the vehicle; 
f) calculating the mean ω of these angular speeds; and 
g) determining the developed length L
i
 of each wheel using the formula: 

L
i
 = 
ω
ω

 × L
o
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in that steps e) to g) are repeated 
at regular intervals with filtering to eliminate variations in speed or extraneous 

slippage.  
 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that it 
consists in triggering an alarm if the developed length of a wheel deviates from 

the theoretical developed length and/or the developed length of the other wheels 
by a value that is greater than a predetermined value. 
A method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
control is performed individually for each wheel. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the control is 
performed by axle. 
Application of the method according to one of Claims 1 to 6 for estimating wear 
on tyres and/or for detecting that a wheel of incorrect diameter has been fitted.
