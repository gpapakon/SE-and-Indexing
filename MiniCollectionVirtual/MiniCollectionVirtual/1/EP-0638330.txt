<ABSTRACT>
An electrotherapy transducer (1) wherein an 
insulating sheet (6) of flexible plastic material 

supports a number of square electrodes (3a, 3b) arranged 
in the form of matrix and presenting equally spaced (D) 

adjacent straight edges; the transducer (1) being 
connected to a signal source for supplying adjacent 

electrodes (3a, 3b) with electric signals of opposite 
polarity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrotherapy 
transducer. Electrotherapy devices are known wherein a signal 
source supplies a transducer connected to a surface 
portion of the human body with a periodic electric 
signal of a given amplitude and waveform, for producing 
a therapeutic current in the body portion close to the 
transducer. Known transducers generally comprise two (or more) 
normally flat metal electrodes which are placed manually 
on to the surface of the patient's body and strapped or 
tied in place. Being adjusted only roughly by hand, the 
distance between the adjacent edges of the electrodes is 
seldom constant, so that the current flowing between the 
electrodes often differs in intensity, thus resulting in 
nonuniform current distribution and impaired therapeutic 
efficiency of the transducer as a whole. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an electrotherapy transducer designed to 
overcome the drawbacks typically associated with known  
 
transducers. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a transducer as described in Claim 1. The present invention will be described with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a schematic plan view of a first 
embodiment of a transducer in accordance with the 
present invention; Figure 2 shows a plan view, with parts removed for 
clarity, of a further embodiment of a transducer in 
accordance with the present invention; Figure 3 shows a section along line III-III in 
Figure 2. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates an electrotherapy 
transducer comprising sixteen square electrodes 3 
arranged on a flexible support 6 conveniently formed 
from a rectangular sheet of insulating material (e.g. 
rubber or soft plastic) and which is applied to a 
portion of the patient's body (not shown). More specifically, electrodes 3 are arranged on 
sheet 6 in such a manner as to form an orderly square 
matrix structure, and present straight adjacent edges 
separated by a constant distance D. Electrodes 3 are made of metal (e.g. stainless 
steel, pure aluminium, titanium, etc.) or good 
electrically conductive synthetic material. Transducer 1 also comprises a first electric 
connecting line 10 connecting eight electrodes 3a; and a  
 
second connecting line 11 connecting eight electrodes 3b 
adjacent to and equally spaced in relation to electrodes 
3a. Each row and each column in the matrix structure is 
thus composed of alternate electrodes 3a and 3b 
connected respectively to lines 10 and 11. Transducer 1 also
