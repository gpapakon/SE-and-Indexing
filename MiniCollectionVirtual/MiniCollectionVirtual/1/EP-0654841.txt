<ABSTRACT>
Resonator holes (2a to 2d) are formed extending one 
to the other of a pair of opposing end surfaces of a 

dielectric block (1), and inner conductors (3a to 3d) are 
formed on inner peripheral surfaces of resonator holes (2a 

to 2d) respectively. On an outer surface of dielectric 
block (1), a pair of input/output electrodes (5a, 5b) and 

one antennal electrode (6) are formed, and expect these 
regions, an outer conductor (4) is formed. By the 

coupling of two resonators corresponding to the resonator 
holes (2a, 2b), a transmitting filter is provided, and by 

two resonators corresponding to resonator holes (2c, 2d), 
a receiving filter is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an antenna duplexer.
More specifically, the present invention relates to an
antenna duplexer used for mobile communication equipments
such as automobile telephone and portable telephone.Fig. 1 is an equivalent circuit diagram of an antenna
duplexer serving both as an antenna for a transmitter and
an antenna for a receiver. Referring to Fig. 1, the
antenna duplexer includes three terminals for input and
output, that is, transmitting terminal TX, receiving
terminal RX and an antenna terminal ANT. Resonators R1
and R2 are for the transmitter, and resonators R3 and R4
are for the receiver. One end of each of these resonators
R1 to R4 is grounded. The other end of resonator R1 is
connected to transmitting terminal TX through an external
coupling capacitance Ce1, and the other end of resonator
R2 is connected to antenna terminal ANT through external
coupling capacitance Ce2. The other end of resonator R3
is also connected to antenna terminal ANT through external
coupling capacitance Ce3, and the other end of resonator
R4 is connected to receiving terminal RX through an 
external coupling capacitance Ce4.Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing a specific
example of the antenna duplexer shown in Fig. 1.
Referring to Fig. 2, the antenna duplexer includes two
dielectric filters la and lb, and a coupling board 20.
Each of the dielectric filters 1a and 1b consists of two
stages of resonators. More specifically, dielectric
filter la includes an approximately rectangular dielectric
block 10a which includes two resonator holes 21a and 22a
extending from an apertured surface 11a to the other
surface 12a opposing to the apertured surface 11a, and
inner conductors 31a and 32a formed on inner peripheral
surfaces of resonator holes 21a and 22a, respectively.At corner portions extending from both side surfaces
to the bottom surface of dielectric block 1a, a pair of
input/output electrodes 5la and 52a are formed. On the
outer peripheral surface except the regions on which
input/output electrodes 51a and 52a are formed, an outer
conductor 4a is provided. The inner conductors 31a and
32a are not provided at end portions of resonator holes
21a and 22a on the side of the apertured surface
(hereinafter referred to as open end surface) 11a, and
therefore on this side 11a, inner conductors 31a and 32a
are isolated from external conductor 4a (not connected).
On the other surface (hereinafter referred to as short-circuited 
surface) 12a opposing to the open end surface
11a, the resonator holes 21a and
