<ABSTRACT>
Method and detector arrangement for measurement 
of relative humidity in particular in radiosondes 

(100). In the humidity detector (14), an active 
material is used whose electric properties are a 

function of the amount of water absorbed by said 
material. The humidity detector (14) is heated so as 

to remove any ice, frost or condensed humidity 
gathered on its face and/or in its vicinity. The temperature 

(T) of the humidity detector (14) and/or the 
ambient temperature (T
a
) is/are detected, and 
this/these quantity/quantities is/are utilized in the 

computing of the humidity measurement values (U). 
The humidity detector (14) is protected by means of 

a mechanical shield construction (10) arranged 
around the detector. The shield construction (10) is 

heated to a temperature higher than the ambient 
temperature so that no substantial condensing or 

freezing of humidity takes place on the humidity 
detector (14) or on the structures in the vicinity of 

same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for measurement of relative humidity by using a
humidity detector, in particular in radiosondes, in which humidity detector an active
material is used whose electric properties are a function of the amount of water
absorbed by said material, in which method said detector is heated so as to remove
any ice, frost or condensed humidity gathered on its face and/or in its vicinity, in
which method the temperature of the humidity detector and/or the ambient temperature
is/are detected and this/these quantity/quantities is/are utilized in the computing
of the humidity measurement values, and in which method the humidity detector is
protected by means of a mechanical shield construction arranged around the detector.Further, the invention concerns a detector arrangement, in particular for radio-sondes,
for measurement of the relative humidity of the environment, which detector
arrangement comprises a humidity measurement detector and a detector for measurement
of its temperature as well as a shield that surrounds said detectors, which
detector arrangement includes a heating resistor, to which electric current is fed, by
whose means the humidity detector and its environment are heated, and which
arrangement further includes a detector for measurement of the ambient temperature.In the prior art, a number of different electrically detected temperature and humidity
detectors are known whose impedance changes as a function of the quantity to be
measured. Such humidity detectors are known, e.g., from the US Patents Nos.
3,168,829 and 3,350,941 and from the applicant's Finnish Patent No. 48,229.The FI Patent No. 48,229 is related to the prior art concerned in the present
invention, in which patent a capacitive humidity detector is described in which the
dielectric insulating material is a polymer film whose permittivity is a function of the
amount of water absorbed by the polymer film. As is known in the prior art, also for measurement of temperature, capacitive
detectors are used, which are usually based on the fact that the permittivity of the
insulating material between the capacitor plates is dependent on the temperature, in
which case the capacitance detected from the terminals of the detector also depends
on the temperature.In the detectors described above and also in other detectors based on change in
impedance, undesirable phenomena occur, which include freezing and wetting of
detectors, radiation error, slowness of the detectors, and hysteresis.In the applicant's FI Patent No.
