<DESCRIPTION>
It is sometimes desirable to increase the modulus 
of rubber compounds. For instance, it is generally 
desirable to increase the modulus of rubber compounds 
which are utilized in tire tread base compositions and 
in tire wire coat compounds. A higher degree of 
stiffness in such rubber compositions is 
conventionally attained by incorporating larger 
amounts of fillers, such as carbon black, into the 
rubber compounds and/or by increasing the state of 
cure of such compounds. Unfortunately, both of these 
techniques lead to undesirable results. For instance, 
the incorporation of additional carbon black into 
rubber compounds typically leads to high levels of 
hysteresis. Accordingly, the utilization of such 
compounds in tires results in excessive heat build-up 
and poor cut growth characteristics. The utilization 
of high amounts of sulfur to attain a high state of 
cure typically leads to poor aging resistance. 
Furthermore, it is highly impractical to reach high 
levels of stiffness by increased state of cure alone. 
For these reasons, it is not possible to attain the 
desired degree of stiffness in rubber compounds by 
simply adding higher levels of fillers or curatives. The present invention relates to novel alloys 
derived from a polyester, polyepoxide and unvulcanized 
rubber. These alloys are particularly useful in the 
preparation of rubber vulcanizates. There is disclosed a composition which comprises 
the reaction product of a mixture of:  (a) a polyester resin produced from the 
precondensation reaction of a diol and a dicarboxylic 
compound, said polyester subsequently condensed and 
having an intrinsic viscosity from about 0.13 to about 
0.35 dl/g, a glass transition temperature of at least 
50°C and an acid number from about 5 to 50; (b) at least one polyepoxide having at least two 
epoxy groups per molecule; and (c) an unvulcanized rubber. There is also disclosed a rubber stock comprising 
a blend of: 
(a) a polymer alloy which is the reaction 
product of a mixture of: 
(1) a polyester resin produced from the 
polycondensation reaction of a diol and a dicarboxylic 
compound, said polyester subsequently condensed and 
having an intrinsic viscosity from about 0.13 to about 
0.35 dl/g, a glass transition temperature of at least 
50°C and an acid number from about 5 to 50; (2) at least one polyepoxide having at least two 
epoxy groups per molecule; and (3) an unvulcanized rubber; and (b) an unvulcanized rubber selected from the 
group consisting of natural rubber and synthetic 
rubber
