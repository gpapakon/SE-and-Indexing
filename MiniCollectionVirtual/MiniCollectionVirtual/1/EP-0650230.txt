<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (2) for connecting a 
daughter board (6) to a mother board (4) comprises a 

dielectric housing (8) having a board receiving opening 
(20) therein for receiving the daughter board (6) and 

contacts positioned adjacent the board receiving 
opening (20) and arranged to make electrical contact 

with the daughter board when the latter is inserted 
into the opening in a first position and is rotated 

relatively to the connector into a second position. 
Separate resilient latch members (40) at opposite ends 

of the housing (8) engage the daughter board in its 
second position to retain the latter in this position. 

The latch members (40) are secured in recesses (24) of 
latch receiving portions at opposite ends of the 

housing by retention means comprising securing arms 
(60) engaged with the latch receiving portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical
connector for connecting a first printed circuit board
or mother board to a second printed circuit board or
daughter board and, more particularly, to such a
connector having latch means for retaining the daughter
board in its operational position.Many electrical connectors are known which
provide electrical connection between contact surfaces
of a daughter board and contact areas of a mother
board. In one type of such a connector, the connector
has contacts positioned therein which extend from a
first mating surface of the connector to a second
mating surface. The contacts have posts which extend
from the connector and make electrical engagement with
the contact areas of the mother board. The daughter
board is then inserted into the connector and rotated
to its operational position. As this rotation occurs,
contact projections of the contacts engage the contact
surfaces of the daughter board. In order for this
electrical engagement to be maintained, it is essential
that latch means be provided to cooperate with and
maintain the daughter board in the operational
position.An example of this type of electrical connector
is described in US-A-4,737,120. As shown in Figure 1
of that patent specification, the latch members are
provided at the ends of the connector and are
integrally molded with the housing. The configuration 
of the latch members provides the latch members with
the resilient characteristics required in order to
allow the latch members to cooperate with the daughter
board to maintain the daughter board in electrical
engagement with the terminals of the connector.However, several problems are associated with
the configuration of the latch member described above.
As the latch members are molded from plastic material,
and as the resilient characteristics of plastic is not
significant, the latch members are likely to take a
permanent set, particularly when the connector is used
over many cycles. This likelihood is increased due to
the fact that the latch members must have a relatively
thin width when molded. This requirement reduces the
durability of the latch members, so that the latch
members are only strong enough to support approximately
25 cycles (insertions and removals of the printed
circuit board). Consequently, if the electrical
connector is to be used over many cycles, the risk of
failure of the electrical connector is greatly
increased.It is also important to note that a relatively
small displacement of the molded latch is enough to
cause the latch

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector (2) for connecting a first
printed circuit board (4) to a second printed circuit

board (6), comprising a first major surface (14) and an
oppositely facing second major surface (16), a board

receiving opening (20) for receiving the second printed
circuit board extending from the first major surface

toward the second major surface and having contacts (22)
positioned adjacent the board receiving opening and

configured to extend from the board receiving opening to
beyond the second major face (16), and a separate

resilient latch member disposed adjacent each end of the
board receiving opening and having a resilient arm (48)

projecting from a base portion (46), a latch portion (54)
at the free end of the resilient arm for engaging the

second board (6) to maintain the latter in position in
the opening (20), and retention means (44,60) for

securing the latch member to the connector, characterised
by wall means (26) upstanding from the first major

surface (14) of the connector adjacent each end of the
board receiving opening (20) and defining a latch

receiving recess (24) positioned outwardly of the
adjacent end of the opening, the base portion (46) of the

associated latch member being seated on a bottom wall
(36) of the recess, and the retention means comprising

securing arm means (60) extending from the base portion
and retaining the latch member in the latch receiving

recess, and further characterised in that the contacts
(22) are posi
tioned and configured to make said 
electrical connections with the second board (6) when the

latter is rotated, relatively to the connector, from a
first position in the board-receiving opening (20) into a

second position.
An electrical connector as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the latch portion (54) has means (58) providing a

lead-in for movement of the second board (6) from the
first to the second position and facilitating manual

movement of the latch portion by a technician for release
of the board and rotation in the opposite direction.
An electrical connector as claimed in claim 2,
wherein the resilient arm has engaging projections

(54,56,58) provided at the free end thereof and forming
the latch portion, said engaging projections cooperating

with the second board (6) when the second board is in the
second position to maintain the latter in said second

position.
An electrical connector as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein the latch member (40) is a resilient metal

member.
