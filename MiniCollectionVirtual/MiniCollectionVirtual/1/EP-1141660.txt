<ABSTRACT>
The inventive device for detecting the relative position of a first rotatable body (10, L), which has a number n of uniform angle markers or teeth (11) comprises at least two rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15), which comprise n1, n2, n3, n4 respective uniform angle markers or teeth. The angle markers of the other rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15) interact with the angle markers (11) of the first rotatable body (10) in such a manner that the relative position  alpha  of the first rotatable body can be determined by detecting the relative positions  theta ,  psi  of the at least two other rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15).

Device for detecting the angular position of a 
first rotatable body (10, L) which has a number n of 

uniform angle markings or teeth (11), comprising at 
least three rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15) which in 

each case have n

 uniform angle markings or 
teeth, the angle markings of the further rotatable 

bodies (12, 13, 14, 15) cooperating with the angle 
markings (11) of the first rotatable body (10) in such 

a way that the angular position α of the first 
rotatable body can be determined by ascertaining the 

angular positions , ψ of the at least two further 
rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15), 
characterized in 
that
 in the case of two rotatable bodies (12, 13; 
12,14; 12,15; 13,14; 13,15; 14,15), it holds that |n

 relatively prime, and in 
the case of more than two rotatable bodies it holds 

that (n

, n

)=1, in which case 1≤i
<
j≤N, where N is the 
total number of the further rotatable bodies (12, 13, 

14, 15). 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the angles  and ψ can be ascertained by means of 

periodic angle sensors (22, 23, 24, 25), and the angle 
α can be ascertained in an evaluation circuit (16) by 

taking account of the angles  and ψ as well as of the 
numbers n, n
i
, n
j
 of the angle markings.  
 
Device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
the angle sensors (22, 23, 24, 25) operate in pairs as 

absolute value transmitters and, in particular, are 
designed as AMR angle sensors which scan magnets (30, 

31) connected to the further rotatable bodies (12, 13, 
14, 15). 
Method for measuring the angle of a rotatable body 
(10, L), in particular a body which can be rotated by 

more than 360°, which has a number of uniform angle 
markings or teeth (n) and cooperate with at least two 

further rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15) which in each 
case have different numbers n

 of uniform 
angle markings or teeth, the angles , ψ of the at 

least two further rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15) 
being ascertained, and the angular position α of the 

first rotatable body being ascertained from the angles 
 and ψ, 
characterized in that
 the following 
relationships hold for the angle markings or teeth of 

the further rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15):

the further rotatable bodies (12, 13, 14, 15), in the 

case of more than two further rotatable bodies.
