<ABSTRACT>
A liquid curable resin composition comprising a urethane (meth)acrylate obtained by the reaction of: (A) a polyether polyol compound containing, as structural units, groups represented by the following formulas: (1) -CH2CH2O-, (2) -CH2CH(R)O-, and (3) one or more groups selected from groups (a) -CH2CH2CH2CH2O-, (b), and (c) as shown above, wherein R represents an alkyl group containing two or more carbon atoms, and R
<
1
>
 and R
<
2
>
 are independently selected from a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; (B) a polyisocyanate compound; and (C) a (meth)acrylate compound having a hydroxy group. The composition exhibits a high curing rate, its cured material has a low Young's modulus and a high gel ratio, provides superior heat resistance and light resistance, and generates only a small amount of hydrogen gas. It is thus particularly suitable as a material for optical fiber coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LIQUID CURABLE RESIN COMPOSITIONF-ifttH of the InventionThe present invention relates to a liquid curable resin composition which has superior curing characteristics, durability, and the like, adheres well to various types of substrates, and is therefore useful as a coating material for plastics, wood, porcelain, glass, paper, and the like, and as an optical molding material, three-dimensional molding material, printing plate material, and the like.DpsÏ€rip ion of r.he Prior ArtGenerally, an optical fiber is provided with a resin coating comprising a flexible primary coating layer on the surface of the optical fiber, with the object of protecting and reinforcing the bare optical fiber threads immediately after hot melt spinning of the glass fiber, the outside of which is covered in turn by a secondary coating layer. The coating material used to form these coatings must have the following characteristics :(1) be a liquid at room temperature and have high processability;(2) provide good productivity at a high curing rate;(3) show superior flexibility;(4) exhibit very little physical change during a wide range of temperature changes ; (5) have superior thermal resistance and superior resistance to hydrolysis;(6) show superior long term reliability with little physical changes over time;(7) show superior resistance to chemicals such as acids and alkalis;(8) exhibit low moisture and water absorption; and(9) exhibit superior light resistance.To meet these requirements various liquid coating materials of the radiation curable type have been developed. 

They are compositions containing urethane acrylate using, for example, tetrahydrofuranethylene oxide ring opening copolymers (Japanese patent Laid-open (ko-kai) No. 86450/1986) , tetrahydrofuranpropylene oxide ring opening copolymer (Japanese Patent Laid-open (ko-kai) No.181170/1985) , or tetrahydrofuranalkyltetrahydrOfuran copolymers (Japanese Patent Laid-open (ko-kai) No. 115964/1989) .Compositions in which- these polyether copolymers are used have drawbacks still to be solved. That is, urethane acrylates using these polyether copolymers are insufficient in one or more of the characteristics, including resistance to ultraviolet light, heat resistance, light resistance (resistance against changing its color into yellow under light radiation) , heat resistance (resistance against changing its color into yellow when heated), and flexibility.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide, with due consideration to the drawbacks of such conventional
