<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming end stops (9) to a continuous 
slide fastener chain (C) including element-free space portions 

(10) at longitudinally spaced intervals, wherein as the chain (C) 
is fed in the backward direction, a pair of rows of interengaged 

coupling elements (E) extending on the downstream side 
of an element-free space portion (10) is spread open by a chain 

splitting apparatus (6) for subsequent molding of a separable 
end stop (9a, 9b) whereas a pair of rows of coupling elements 

(E) on the upstream side of the element-free space portion 
(10) is kept in engaged condition. After the separable end 

stop (9a, 9b) is molded, the chain (C) is fed in the forward 
direction during which time a sprue portion (9c) and gate 

portions (9d) formed integrally with the separable end stop 
(9a, 9b) are caught by a chain splitting member (6a) of the 

chain splitting apparatus (6). The chain splitting member 
(6a) is then lowered to automatically remove the sprue 

portion (9c) and gate portions (9d) from the separable end 
stop (9a, 9b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of continuously 
forming a pair of top end stops, or a separable 
bottom end stop composed of a separable pin and a box pin, 
molded integrally on a continuous slide fastener chain at 
each of successive element-free spaces formed in the slide 
fastener chain at longitudinal intervals, and a chain splitting 
apparatus suitable for use in the end-stop forming method. It has been customary to continuously attach various 
types of end stops, such as top end stops, bottom end 
stops, and separable bottom end stops composed of separable 
pins and box pins, by an end-stop attaching apparatus to a 
continuous slide fastener chain (hereinafter referred to, for 
brevity, as "chain") at ends of element-free space portions 
formed in the chain at longitudinal intervals. In this instance, 
if the end stops are of the type which is composed, such as 
top end stops or separable bottom end stops, of a pair of end 
stop members to be attached to inner longitudinal edges of a 
pair of fastener tapes (hereinafter referred to, for brevity, 
as "tapes"), there is a need to spread open each of the element-free  
 
portions so that the two end stop members can be 
readily inserted in the element-free space portion and subsequently 
attached to the inner longitudinal edges of the 
tapes. For a purpose of spreading the element-free space 
portions, two typical methods have been used as disclosed, 
for example, in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication 
No. 62-42410 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 1-28564, 
respectively. The first spreading method employs a chain 
splitting member which is inserted into an element-free 
space portion of a chain so as to disengage some interengaged 
coupling elements progressively from opposite ends of the 
element-free portion. In the second spreading method, two 
parallel spaced stringers jointly forming a chain and having 
successive spaced rows of disengaged coupling elements are 
fed simultaneously while they are properly positioned for 
the attachment of the end stop members. In a continuous slide-fastener manufacturing system, 
the chain is passed through various processes, such as 
finishing of woven tapes, attachment of coupling elements, 
and application of reinforcing films before it is introduced 
into the end-stop attaching process. During that time, since 
the chain is repeatedly tensioned and slackened, difficulties 
would arise in maintaining the desired dimensional 
accuracy of the two tapes throughout the processes. According

A method of forming end stops (9) molded on a 
continuous slide fastener chain (C) having a pair of stringer 

tapes (T, T) and element-free space portions (10) extending 
at longitudinally spaced intervals between successive spaced 

interengaged rows of coupling elements (E) attached to inner 
longitudinal edges of the stringer tapes (T, T), said method 

comprising the steps of: 

(a) feeding the slide fastener chain (C) longitudinally 
in a forward direction successively through an injection 

molding apparatus (1) and through a chain splitting 
apparatus (6) until one of the element-free space portions 

(10) arrives at a position directly above said chain splitting 
apparatus (6); 
(b) then, activating said chain splitting apparatus 
(6) so that a chain splitting member (6a) of said chain 

splitting apparatus (6) is forced into the element-free 
space portion (10); 
(c) thereafter, feeding the slide fastener chain 
(C) in a backward direction until a pair of endmost coupling 

elements (E) located next to a downstream end of the element-free 
space portion (10) abut respectively on a pair of 

positioning portions (2d) in a mold (2, 3) of the injection 
molding apparatus (1), thereby splitting open a portion of 

one pair of interengaged rows of coupling elements (E) 
 

located on the downstream side of the element-free space 
portion (10); 
(d) then, while the mold (2, 3) is closed, injection-molding 
a molten synthetic resin material in the mold 

(2, 3) to form a pair of end stop members (9a, 9b) integrally 
molded on the respective stringer tapes (T, T) at the 

element-free space portion (10), with a sprue portion (9c) 
and gate portions (9d) integrally molded with and disposed 

between the pair of end stop members (9a, 9b); 
(e) subsequently, while the mold (2, 3) is open, 
feeding the slide fastener chain (C) again in the forward 

direction, thereby causing the sprue portion (9c) and the 
gate portions (9d) to be lockingly engaged by said chain 

splitting member (6a); 
(f) upon engagement between the sprue portion (9c) 
and the gate portions (9d) and said chain splitting member 

(6a), activating said chain splitting apparatus (6) again to 
retract said chain splitting member (6a) from the element-free 

space portioon (10), thereby removing the sprue portion 
(9c) and the gate portions (9d) from the pair of end stop 

members (9a, 9b); and 
(g) thereafter, repeating the preceding steps (a) - 
(f) in the sequence set forth.

slide fastener chain according to claim 1, wherein opposite said 

 
rows of coupling elements (E) splitted after the sprue portion 

(9c) and the gate portions (9d) have been removed are guided 
to a joining portion (5b-1') of a Y-shaped chain guide groove 

(5b-1) formed on a lower block (5b) of a second guide chain 
(5b), and then coupled again at said joining portion 5b-1'by 

the feeding of the chain (C) .
