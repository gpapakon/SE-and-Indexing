<ABSTRACT>
A tube supporting device (32) is provided for 
supporting closely packed tubes (15) in 

a heat exchanger (10). 
The device has a support plate (32) 

transversely disposed with respect to the 
tubes (15). The support plate (32) has a plurality 

of holes (32A,35,36,37,38) formed therein which are penetrated by 
the tubes (15) and which support the tubes against lateral movement. 

The holes can be a variety 
of shapes to create one or more gaps between the peripheral surfaces of the holes and the 

outer surfaces of the tubes. The gaps enhance the flow of condensate which has formed on 
the tubes and causes the condensate to flow to a bottom portion of the heat exchanger 

without moving to and collecting on the support plate. The holes also inhibit lateral 
movement of the tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat exchanger
comprising the features of the
preamble of claim 1. The support plate used in such a heat
exchanger, which is, for example, known from DE-A-3 136 865, supports the tubes.Another support plate is shown, for example, in Japanese Patent Document JP-P-HEI
4-292797 issued to Urabe. Generally, the Urabe heat exchanger is designed for use in an
air conditioning system of a motor vehicle. As such, the tubes are typically subjected to
vibration from the motor vehicle and from the flow of refrigerant fluid in the cooling circuit.
This vibration may cause the tubes to shift, bend, break or otherwise become damaged.
Damage to the tubes may, in turn, cause the space between adjacent tubes to be nonuniform
and the air flow, which passes across the tubes, to become uneven. This can result
in a decrease in the heat exchange efficiency of the heat exchanger. Also, the air resistance
of the beat exchanger may increase. Because of these problems, a beat exchanger may be
provided with a tube support system to inhibit lateral movement of the tubes.Referring to Fig. 1 (Urabe) a tube support plate 32 for supporting closely
packed heat transfer tubes 15 is typically transversely disposed with respect to heat transfer
tubes 15 in the heat exchanger. Tube support plate 32 has a plurality of holes 33,
which receive a plurality of heat transfer tubes 15. Holes 33 are circular in shape and are
respectively identical to, or slightly larger in diameter than, heat transfer tubes 15 to support 
heat transfer tubes 15 against lateral movement. Referring also to Fig.2, each hole 34
includes a plurality of projection portions 34a extending from an edge thereof. Projection
portions 34a contact with an outer surface of a heat transfer tube 15 so as to inhibit lateral
movement of heat transfer tube 15. A relatively small gap 44 is created between the edges
of holes 34 and heat transfer tubes 15.Generally, the air flow contains moisture in a vapor state. Typically, the vapor
is cooled to a temperature below the dew point as the air flow passes across the heat
transfer tubes This temperature reduction changes the vapor into a condensate, which can
form on and adhere to the outer surfaces of the heat transfer tubes.In the Urabe heat exchanger, the condensate which forms on the outer
surfaces of heat transfer tubes 15, can move to and collect on tube support plate 32 if the
outer surfaces of heat transfer tubes 15 contact the inner edges of holes 33 as shown in Fig.
1. This is undesirable for a variety

<CLAIMS>
A heat exchanger (10) comprising a first tank (11); a
second tank (12); at least one tube (15) connected at one

end to the first tank and at the other end to the second
tank for circulation of a first medium between the tanks;

a support plate (32) disposed between the first tank and
the second tank and having at least one hole (35-38) formed

therein, the at least one tube (15) passing through the at
least one hole (35-38) in the plate, the edge of the hole

contacting the tube at a plurality of regions (35c,35d,36b)
around the tube to locate the tube against lateral movement

relatively to the plate, and that part (35f-h;36c,d;37d-f;38e-h)
of the edge of the hole interconnecting at least

one pair of adjacent contact regions consisting of two
substantially straight portions which converge towards one

another and extend from the contact regions at which they
are substantially tangential to the tube to an apex

(35a,b;36a;37a-c;38a-d) remote from the tube to form a
lobe-like aperture adjacent to the tube; and a flow path

(A) for a second medium around the tube(s) (15) to effect
heat exchange between the first and second media;

characterised in that the first and second tanks are upper
and lower tanks (11,12) which are connected by opposed side

plates (30,31) to define therebetween the flow path (A)
which is across the tube(s), the support plate being

mounted substantially horizontally between the side plates;
and in that the or at least one of the apices of the hole

(32) points downstream from the tube relative to the

direction of flow of the second medium along the flow path
whereby any condensation on the tube will tend to be drawn

by the flow of the second medium around the tube and to
drain through the lobe-like aperture rather than collect on

the plate.
A heat exchanger according to claim 1, in which the
apex (35a,b;36a;37a-c;38a-d) is rounded. 
A heat exchanger according to claim 1 or claim 2, in
which the edge of the hole interconnecting each adjacent

pair of contact regions is similarly shaped.
A heat exchanger assembly according to any one of the
preceding claims, in which the hole is substantially

rhombus (Fig. 5), teardrop (Fig. 6), or triangular
(Fig. 7), shaped.
A heat exchanger according to any one of the preceding
claims, in which the contact region extends around an arc

(35c,35d,36b) of the tube.
