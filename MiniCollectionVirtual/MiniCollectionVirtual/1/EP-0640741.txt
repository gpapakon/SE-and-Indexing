<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for controlling the crossing of a passage subject to authorization, in particular of the type comprising a turnstile (revolving door) with several arms which acts as a device for obstructing or opening up this passage, this turnstile being connected to at least one locking element 7, 9 able to lock its rotation or to allow this rotation, and this locking element itself being under the control of a logic device 18 which, on the one hand, receives signals representing a situation in which the passage is closed or open and, on the other hand, receives signals representing the angular position of the said turnstile, these signals being supplied by a detection head 17. This apparatus is characterised in that the said detection head 17 comprises a drum 14 which is coupled in rotation to the said turnstile, this drum bearing markers 15 which are arranged at angular intervals and can be detected by a special sensor 16 without coming into contact with it.

Apparatus for controlling passage along a path that is 
subject to authorization, in particular apparatus of the 

type comprising a turnstile having a plurality of arms 
constituting a member for obstructing or releasing 

passage along the path, said turnstile being associated 

with at least one locking element (7, 9) suitable for 
preventing it from rotating or for allowing it to rotate, 

said locking element itself being placed under the 
control of a logic device (18) that receives both signals 

representative of passage being authorized or refused, 
and signals representative of the angular position of 

said turnstile, as provided by a detector head (17), the 
apparatus being characterized in that said detector head 

comprises a drum (14) having a rotary coupling with said 
turnstile, the drum carrying references (15) that are 

angularly spaced apart from one another internally along 
the generator lines of said drum (14) and that are suitable 

for being detected by an appropriate sensor (16) without 
contact being made. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said references (15) are of a type suitable for being 

detected optically. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the rotary coupling between said drum (14) and said 

turnstile is provided with a ratio of three, such that 
said drum rotates three times faster than said turnstile. 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, characterized 
in that the pattern of said references (15) is symmetrical 

so as to ensure that drum position information is valid for 
either direction of rotating of the drum (14).  

 
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, 
characterized in that it includes a non-return system, 

preventing successive passages being obtained on the 
basis of a single authorization by alternately rotating 

the turnstile in opposite directions.
