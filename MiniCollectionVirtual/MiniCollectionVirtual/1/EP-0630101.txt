<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the distortion performance of a feed 
forward corrected amplifier an amplifier arrangement includes a 

distortion generator 312, intermediate the input 15 and the main 
amplifier 1. The arrangement is such that the input signal 

passes to the distortion generator 312 via a coupler 307. The 
signal passes via a delay network 310 which compensates for the 

delay of distortion network 312 and is tapped by a coupler 308 
to be combined by a coupler 313 with the distorted signal from 

the distortion generator 312. In this way the output of the 
distortion generator is subtracted from a sample of the input 

signal so that only the distortion remains to pass via phase and 
amplitude correction networks respectively 314 and 315 to be 

amplified by a gain element 316 before being coupled back into 
the main signal path by a coupler 309. 
The correction is active over a portion of the amplifier 
characteristic only,being the compression region of the amplifier 

Hence the amplifier compression point may be raised. Raising 
the compression point increases the overall power handling 

capability of the amplifier by increasing the level at which the 
overall arrangement will saturate to cause distortion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amplifiers and in 
particular to high power amplifiers wherein feed forward 
cancellation is employed, such as those used in wide band radio-frequency 
(r.f.) applications. In amplifier design, there is a trade off to be made 
between distortion performance and efficiency. Amplifiers which 
operate under so-called 'Class A' conditions have good distortion 
but low efficiency whereas an amplifier operated under class C 
conditions is reasonably efficient but introduces significant 
distortion. High efficiency and low distortion is the goal, but 
efficiency increasingly becomes a consideration at high power 
levels. For example, a typical cellular radio multi-carrier base 
station amplifier requirement would be 200w average, 2kw peak 
so clearly efficiency must be the best achievable if undue heat 
dissipation in the amplifier is to be avoided. Unfortunately, the 
common technique of negative feedback, as used in fixed 
frequency intermediate frequency amplifiers for example, to 
correct distortion can only be considered for narrow band 
applications in r.f. high power amplifiers. For this reason, many r.f. 
power amplifiers operate in class A with the consequent heat 
dissipation tolerated. As an alternative to class A operation, a more efficient 
class AB amplifier may be employed if feed-forward cancellation is 
applied. In this technique, the amplifier output (suitably scaled) is 
compared with the input signal in a first comparison loop to yield 
an error signal. The error signal is amplified and reintroduced to 
the output 180o out of phase with the original distortion in a 
second correction loop, the distortion products being thereby 
cancelled in the final output. Feed forward can yield a 30dB 
improvement in distortion performance but only if both the first 
comparison loop and the second correcting loop are accurately 
aligned. Generally the loop parameters do not remain constant 
over the full operating range of the amplifier and some dynamic 
correction is required.  Generally, attempts at improving the performance of feed 
forward amplifiers have centred upon balancing parameters of the 
comparison loop and the cancellation loop. For an account of such 
techniques, reference may be made to the applicant's co-pending 
patent applications reference SC00095EB and SC00097EB both 
entitled "Improvements in or relating to amplifiers," and filed on 
the same day as the present application. A particular problem with feed forward amplifiers is that
