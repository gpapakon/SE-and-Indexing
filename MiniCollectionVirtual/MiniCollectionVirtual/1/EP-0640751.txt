<ABSTRACT>
In a compression release engine brake (10), 
electrically controlled mechanisms (50) are provided to 

partly selectively control the positions or motions of 
the engine brake slave pistons (70) which periodically open 

the exhaust valves (140) in the associated internal 
combustion engine (100) when engine braking is desired. The 

electrically controlled mechanisms (50) can be used for such 
purposes as controlling the "lash" of the engine brake 

or controlling the timing and duration of exhaust valve 
openings. Because these mechanisms are electrically 

controlled, they can be made to operate substantially 
instantaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compression release
engine brakes, and more particularly to apparatus for
controlling, adjusting, or modifying the timing or
other related characteristics of the operation of
compression release engine brakes.As shown, for example, in Cummins U.S. patent
3,220,392, a compression release engine brake or
retarder may be mounted on an internal combustion
engine to temporarily convert the engine from a power
source to a power consuming gas compressor. An engine
brake performs this function by using an appropriately
timed mechanical input from one part of the engine to
open an exhaust valve or valves in an engine cylinder
which is nearing top dead center of its compression
stroke. This allows the gas compressed in that
cylinder to escape to the exhaust manifold of the
engine, thereby preventing the engine from recovering
the work of compression during the subsequent "power"
stroke of the cylinder. (Of course, the fuel supply to
the engine is typically turned off during operation of
the engine brake.) In this way the engine brake helps
to slow down or retard the engine and the vehicle
propelled by the engine, thereby reducing the need to 
use the ordinary wheel brakes of the vehicle. This
prolongs the life of the wheel brakes and increases
vehicle safety.In order to perform the function described
above, a compression release engine brake typically
includes hydraulic circuits for transferring the above-mentioned
mechanical inputs to the exhaust valves to be
opened. Each such hydraulic circuit has a master
piston which is reciprocated in a master piston bore by
the associated mechanical input from the engine.
Hydraulic fluid in the circuit transmits the motion of
the master piston to a slave piston in the circuit.
Thus the slave piston reciprocates in a slave piston
bore in response to the flow of hydraulic fluid in the
circuit. The slave piston acts, either directly or
through the exhaust valve opening mechanism of the
engine, on the exhaust valve or valves to be opened,
thereby opening the exhaust valve or valves at the
appropriate times.The timing of the exhaust valve openings
described above is critical to the performance of the
engine brake. Slight differences in timing can greatly
affect the braking horsepower produced, as well as such
other performance characteristics as the stress imposed
on various components of the engine and engine brake.
For example, delaying the initial opening of the
exhaust valve until closer to top dead center of the
compression stroke typically

A compression release engine brake (10)
comprising a hydraulic circuit (42, 62, 72) for

transferring a mechanical input received from a first
part (130) of an internal combustion engine (100)

associated with the engine brake to a second part (140)
of the engine to cause an exhaust valve (140) in the

engine to open at a time when the engine would not
otherwise open that exhaust valve, said hydraulic

circuit including a slave piston (70) reciprocating in
a slave piston bore (72) in response to hydraulic fluid

flowing in said hydraulic circuit, a mechanical element
(55) mounted for movement relative to said slave piston

bore,
said mechanical element (55)

(70) when said mechanical element is in contact with

said slave piston characterised in that electrically controlled means (52, 54, 56) are provided
for selectively moving said mechanical element (55) so

that said mechanical element selectively contacts said
slave piston (70) in order to selectively modify the

movement of said slave piston in response to the flow
of hydraulic fluid in said hydraulic circuit .
The apparatus defined in claim 1 wherein
said mechanical element (55) comprises a rod (55)

substantially aligned with the axis of reciprocation of
said slave piston (70) and projecting into the

hydraulic fluid in said slave piston bore (72) which
causes said slave piston to reciprocate.
The apparatus defined in claim 2 wherein
said electrically controlled means (52, 54, 56) 

selectively moves said rod (55) substantially parallel
to the axis of reciprocation of said slave piston (70)

in order to selectively change the amount by which said
rod projects into the hydraulic fluid in said slave

piston bore (72) which causes said slave piston to
reciprocate.

wherein said electrically controlled means (52, 54, 56)

comprises an electromagnetic coil (52).
The apparatus defined in any of claims 1-4
wherein said electrically controlled means (52, 54, 56)

(72) to permit adjustment of the movement of said

mechanical element (55) in response to said
electrically controlled means.
The apparatus defined in claim 3 wherein
said electrically controlled means (52, 54, 56)

selectively moves said rod (55) toward said slave
piston (70) in order to push said slave piston closer

to said second part (140) of the engine than said slave
piston otherwise would be.
he apparatus defined in claim 3 wherein
passing an electrical current through said electrically

controlled means (52, 54, 56) enables said electrically
controlled means to extend said rod (55) toward said

slave piston (70).
