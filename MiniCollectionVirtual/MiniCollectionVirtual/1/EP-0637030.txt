<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of laminating circuitized polymeric 

dielectric panels with pad to pad electrical connection 
between the panels. This pad to pad electrical connection is 

provided by a transient liquid phase formed bond of a joining 
metallurgy characterized by a non-eutectic stoichiometry 

composition of a eutectic forming system. The eutectic 
temperature of the system is below the first thermal 

transition of the polymeric dielectric, and the melting 
temperature of the joining metallurgy composition is above the 

first thermal transition temperature of the polymeric 
dielectric.
