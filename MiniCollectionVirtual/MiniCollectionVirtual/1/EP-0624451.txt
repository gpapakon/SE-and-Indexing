<ABSTRACT>
A blow core inserting device (32) for a rotary type blow molding 
machine is arranged in a blow molding section of the blow molding 

machine, and includes as essential components a pair of guide 
member (32a) standing upright at the upper part of the blow molding 

section, a seat member (33) vertically displaceably supported by the 
guide members, a seat member raising/lowering unit including a 

piston (36) and a cylinder (34) for raising or lowering sait seat 
member, a rod inserting cylinder (35) immovably mounted on said 

seat member (33), a blow core (38) adapted to be raised or lowered by 
said rod inserting cylinder (35) and at least a stopper unit (41) 

actuatable for immovably holding the seat member relative to the 
guide members.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary type blow molding machine
including a preform molding section, a die temperature controlling
section, a blow molding section and a blow-molded article discharging
section, and a blow core inserting device arranged in said blow molding
section.A molding machine for
blow
molding of a molded article such as a bottle has already
been well known from Japanese Patent Publication No. 53-22096. It is an object of this invention to provide a
rotary type blow molding machine as defined above and
comprising an improved blow core inserting device.According to this invention,
the blow core inserting device is as defined in the characterizing
part of claim 1. The drawings schematically shows one embodiment
of a rotary type injection blow molding machine comprising a blow
core inserting device according to the present invention.
FIG. 1 is a front view;FIG. 2 is a front view with an upper portion longitudinally
sectioned; FIG. 3 is a partial longitudinal sectional view
of an injection molding operating portion;FIG. 4 is a front view of a blowing device;FIG. 5 is a partial front view of the blowing device;
andFIG. 6 is a longitudinal sectional view of a receptacle
with a preform indicated by the dash-dotted contour
lines.In the drawings, the reference numeral 1 designates
a machine bed, on the upper surface of which is placed
and fixed a lower base plate 2. The reference numeral
3 designates an upper base plate, which is provied in parallel
above the lower base plate, and a transfer plate 4 is rotatably
provided on the underside of the upper base plate 3.The upper base plate 3 is supported on a plurality
of support poles 5, 5 stood in the periphery of the lower
base plate 2, and a work space is formed between both the
upper and lower base plates. The transfer plate 4 is held by
edge members (not shown in the figure) partially provided
in the periphery of the upper base plate 3.On the upper surface of the upper base plate 3
there are provided a pair of parallel ribs 6, 6 crossed
in all directions. A portion between each pair of ribs 
6 and 6 except the central portion of the base plate surrounded
by the ribs forms holes 7 and 7 open to all directions
of the base plate.The transfer plate 4 comprises an annular body
having a hole in the center thereof, and a wheel internally
formed with a rack 8 is mounted on the hole edge of the
annular body. The annular body has holes 9 for receiving
a core mold in all directions thereof. The lower surface
of the transfer plate 4 where each hole 9 is

<CLAIMS>
A rotary type blow molding machine including a preform
molding section, a die temperature controlling section, a blow

molding section and a blow-molded article discharging section, and a
blow core inserting device (32) arranged in said blow molding section,

characterized in that said blow core inserting device comprises :

a pair of guide member (32a) standing upright at the upper
part of said blow molding section,
a seat member (33) vertically displaceably supported by said
guide members (32a),
a seat member raising/lowering unit including a piston (36)
and a cylinder (34) for raising or lowering said seat member (33),
a rod inserting cylinder (35) immovably mounted on said seat
member (33),
a blow core (38) adapted to be raised or lowered by said rod
inserting cylinder (35), and
at least a stopper unit (41) actuatable for immovably holding
said seat member relative to said guide members.
The machine according to claim 1, wherein the stopper
unit (41) includes a stopper member (40) adapted to be fitted into an

engagement recess (39) formed around one of said guide members.
The machine according to claim 2, wherein said
engagement recess (39) is contoured in the form of an annular groove

and located at the position in the vicinity of the lowest position of
said seat member.
The machine according to claim 2, wherein said stopper
member (40) is projected from and retracted in said stopper unit. 
The machine according to claim 1, wherein a blow core
(38) is caused to extend through said piston rod (37) of said seat

member raising/lowering unit along the center axis of said piston of
the same so as to allow compressed air to be blown into a preform

received in a blow molding die assembly.
