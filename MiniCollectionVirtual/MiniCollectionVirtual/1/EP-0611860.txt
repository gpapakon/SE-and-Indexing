<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a locking device, especially for motor vehicles, with a housing (2) and with a lock cylinder (3) which is arranged in a cylinder liner (6) mounted rotatably in the housing (2) and held by an overload coupling (8) and which has tumblers (5) cooperating with the cylinder liner (6) as well as a radially displaceable spring-loaded driver (10) for a rotatably mounted coupling element (11) arranged coaxially relative to the lock cylinder (3), the driver (10) furthermore cooperating with a control element (15), for which a guide cam (16) is formed on the housing (2) on the inside. The essence of the invention is that, during the normal locking function, the driver (10) is supported with its free end (20) radially outwards on the coupling element (11) and is located at a distance from the effective inner contour (27) of the rotatably arranged cylinder liner (6) or from a part (catch ring 17) connected thereto and drives the coupling element (11, 11b) via at least one nose (21) or the like (part 39b, 40b).

A lock device, in particular for motor vehicles, comprising a 
housing (2) and a lock cylinder (3) which is arranged in a cylinder 

sleeve (6) mounted rotatably in the housing (2) and held by an overload 
coupling (8) and which has tumblers (5) co-operating with the cylinder 

sleeve (6) and a radially displaceable, spring-loaded entrainment means 
(10) for a coupling element (11) which is mounted rotatably and arranged 

coaxially with respect to the lock cylinder (3), wherein the entrainment 
means (10) further co-operates with a control element (15) for which a 

guide cam (16) is provided internally on the housing (2), characterised 
in that in the normal locking function the entrainment means (10) is 

supported with its free end (20) radially outwardly against the coupling 
element (11) and is at a spacing from the effective internal contour (27) 

of the rotatably arranged cylinder sleeve (6) or a portion (retaining 
ring (17) connected thereto and entrains the coupling element (11, 11b) 

by way of at least one projection (21) or the like (portion 39b, 40b), 
and that the coupling element (11) has a through opening (23) for the end 

portion (24) of the lock cylinder (3). 
A lock device according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
coupling element (11) has at the entrainment means side a circular 

opening (25) and an annular raised edge portion (26) and that respective 
openings (22, 25') are arranged in the edge portion (26) and in the end 

portion (24) of the lock cylinder (3) for accommodating the projection 
(21) of the entrainment means (10). 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the overload coupling (8) and the control element 

(15) are combined to form a functional unit. 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the overload coupling (8) includes at the same time 

a retaining ring (17).  
 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the control element (15a) is a part of the 

retaining ring (17a). 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the entrainment means (10b) symmetrically engages 

the coupling element (11b). 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that there are provided movable portions (39b, 40b) 

controlled by the entrainment means (10b) for positively lockingly 
connecting the end portion (24b) of the l
ock cylinder (3b) to the 
coupling element (11b). 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the control element (15, 15a, 15b) and/or the 

movable portions (39b, 40b) serving at the same time as entrainment means 
are of a roller-like or ball-like or disc-like or polygonal 

configuration. 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that at the level of the plane of the control element 

(15) and the entrainment means (10) in its external contour (50) the lock 
cylinder (3) has at least one contour surface (51) which faces towards 

the control element (15) in the locked position and which is positively 
lockingly adapted to the control element (15). 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that there are provided two entrainment means (10c, 

10c'). 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a cylinder guide means (54c) is arranged between 

the housing (2c) and the cylinder sleeve (6c).  
 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the control element (15c) associated with each 

entrainment means (10c, 10c') is arranged in an aperture (68c) in the 
cylinder sleeve (6c). 
A lock device according to one or more of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the cylinder sleeve (6c) is freely rotatably 

arranged in the cylinder guide means (54c) and can be releasably fixed in 
position by means of a spring element (57c).
