<ABSTRACT>
Diaryl carbonates can be prepared by reacting aromatic hydroxy compounds with CO and O2 at elevated temperature on a noble metal catalyst in the presence of a base, a quaternary salt, a cocatalyst and a drying agent. According to the invention, the noble metal catalyst is activated with CO in the presence of the quaternary salt and optionally in the presence of the cocatalyst. In one particular process variant, a preformed alkali metal phenolate is employed as the base.

of the quaternary salt and in the presence or in the 
absence of the cocatalyst, with the noble metal 

catalyst being present in the activation mixture in 
an amount of 0.0001-30% by weight, based on the 

total reaction mixture. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the noble metal is palladium, preferably in the form 

of palladium bromide.

or tetraalkylphosphonium salt in an 
amount of from 0.1 to 50% by weight, preferably from 

0.5 to 15% by weight, particularly preferably from 
1 to 5% by weight, based on the weight of the reaction 

mixture. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that it is carried out without addition 

of solvents. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the desiccant used is a zeolite, 

preferably one of the type A.
