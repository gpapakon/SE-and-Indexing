<ABSTRACT>
A tile for decorating a ceiling or wall is cast from hydrated pllaster and is of a shape such that a plurality of identical tiles can be applied to the ceiling or wall without space between adjacent tiles, the front face of the tile having a set of grooves generally parallel to an edge thereof. The tiles form a repeating pattern and the joins are indistinguishable from the adjacent grooves.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Ceiling and Wall DecorationThis invention relates to the decoration of ceiling and walls and more particularly to a ceiling or wall tile, to a method of decorating a ceiling or wall and to a kit for use in carrying out the method. A conventional method of decorating a ceiling comprises spreading a layer of plaster by hand over the ceiling and then forming a pattern in the surface of the plaster before it dries. Typically a repetitive scrolled or swirling pattern is formed using a grooved tool. However, it is impossible, even for a skilled decorator, to form a pattern which is perfectly repetitive; the shapes created and the depths of the grooves inevitably vary.It is an object of this invention to enable a ceiling or wall to be decorated with a pattern which is regular in appearance, yet the ceiling or wall can be decorated without requiring special skills.In accordance with this invention, there is provided a decoration unit, particularly a tile, for decorating a ceiling or wall, the unit having a plain rear face for adhering to the ceiling or wall and a grooved front face generally parallel to the rear face, the unit having an edge shape enabling a plurality of identical such units to be applied to the ceiling or wall without space between adjacent units, the front face of the unit having grooves which lie generally parallel to an edge of the unit, and the unit being cast from hydrated plaster.Such decoration units or tiles can be fixed easily to the ceiling or wall using adhesive, adjacent units being abutted together without spaces and forming a repeating pattern of regular form. The join between each adjacent pair of units or tiles is indistinguishable from the grooves of at least one of those tiles. Further, because the tile is cast from plaster, it is light in weight and non-flammable, and can be cut easily. The units or tiles can be formed in symmetrically perfect moulds so that they can be closely abutted. The 

preferred plaster is calcium sulphate hemihydrate plaster. Preferably the units are cast- from a mixture having a relatively high proportion of plaster to water so that the cast unit will have a high strength and high surface hardness: also such a mixture minimises the possibility of air bubbles, which would spoil the appearance of the cast product. Preferably the mixture includes fillers, e.g. glass fibres, to improve the strength of the cast product.Preferably the decoration unit or tile has its grooves arranged so that, when identical tiles are abutted together on a ceiling or wall,

Claims
1) A decoration unit, particularly a tile, for decorating a ceiling or wall, the unit having a plain rear face for adhering to the ceiling or wall and a grooved front face generally parallel to the rear face, the unit having an edge shape enabling a plurality of identical such units to be applied to the ceiling or wall without space between adjacent units, the front face of the unit having
"
 grooves which lie generally parallel to an edge of the unit, and the unit being cast from hydrated plaster.
2) A decoration unit as claimed in claim 1, shaped so that when a plurality of identical such units are applied to a ceiling or wall without space between adjacent units, then along every join line between a pair of adjacent units, said grooves of at least one unit of the pair lie generally parallel to that line.
3) A decoration unit as claimed in claim 1 or 2, generally in the shape of a fan having a first convex arcuate edge and second and third concave arcuate edges of the same curvature as but half the length of the first arcuate edge.
4) A decoration unit as claimed in claim 3, in which said grooves lie generally parallel to the first arcuate edge.
5) A decoration unit claimed in claim 3 or 4, in which said arcuate edges are scalloped.
6) A decoration unit as claimed in claim 2, in the shape of a large triangle with two smaller triangles of the same shape as the large triangle but inverted and of half the height, the smaller triangles adjoining respective sides of the large triangle adjacent a base edge thereof.
7) A decoration unit as claimed in claim 6, in which the large triangle is formed with a set of grooves parallel to its 


base edge and the smaller triangles are formed with grooves parallel to their outer lateral edges.
8) A decoration unit as claimed in claim 2, in the shape of a hexagon, having six identical triangular portions with respective sets of grooves parallel to the free edges of the hexagon.
9) A method of decorating a ceiling or wall by adhering a plurality of decoration units or tiles, each cast from hydrated plaster to the ceiling or wall in a repeating arrangement without spaces between adjacent units or tiles, the units or tiles being of identical shape or of two or more different shapes, the front face of each unit or tile having grooves which lie generally parallel to an edge thereof.
10) A decoration kit for a ceiling or wall, the kit comprising a set of decoration units or tiles each cast from hydrated plaster, and a quantity of adhesive material for use in adhering the units or tiles to the ceiling or wall, the units or tiles being of identical shape or of two or more different shapes but such that they can be applied to the ceiling or wall in a repeating arrangement and without spaces between adjacent units or tiles, the front face of each unit or tile having grooves which lie generally parallel to an edge thereof.
