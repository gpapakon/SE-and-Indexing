<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst and a catalytic method for reducing nitrogen oxides are disclosed. The catalyst consists of an MFI zeolite exchanged with 0.3-2 wt % of palladium on the basis of the overall weight of the catalyst. Said catalyst and method may be used in any selective catalytic nitrogen oxide reduction method, in particular for treating exhaust gases from natural gas powered vehicles.

<CLAIMS>
Catalyst for the reduction of the nitrogen oxides consisting of a zeolite
of the MFI type exchanged for between 0.3 % and 2 % by weight of Pd

with respect to the total weight of the catalyst, characterized in that the
said zeolite of the of the MFI type has a Si/Al ratio lying between 15

and 19.
Catalyst according to claim 1, characterized in that the said zeolite is
exchanged for 0.5 % by weight of Pd.
Method for the reduction of the nitrogen oxides by methane or any
mixture predominantly containing methane such as natural gas,

characterized in that it comprises a step of contacting a reaction medium
comprising methane among others, oxygen and nitrogen oxides with a

catalyst consisting of a zeolite of the MFI type exchanged for between
0.3 % and 2 % by weight of palladium with respect to the total weight of

the catalyst, the said zeolite having a Si/Al ratio lying between 15 and
19, thereby permitting to selectively reduce the nitrogen oxides into N
2
.
Method according to claim 3, characterized in that the zeolite of the MFI
type is exchanged for 0.5% by weight of palladium with respect to the

total weight of the catalyst.
Method according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the said catalyst
is obtained with tetramine-palladium II hydroxide as a precursor of Pd.
Method according to any one of claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the
catalyst is activated, before use, under oxygen by a process comprising

the steps of:

(a) a temperature rising from the ambient temperature up to 300°C with a
temperature rising speed of 0.5°C/mn, 
(b) keeping at 300°C for 1 hour,
(c) a temperature rising from 300°C to 500°C with a temperature rising
speed of 0.5°C/mn,
(d) keeping at 500°C for 1 hour, and
(e) a temperature decrease from 500°C down to 300°C.
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that after the step (e), one
carries out a step (f) of scavenging with an inert gas such as helium at

300°C.
Method according to any one of claims 3 to 7, characterized in that the
said reaction medium may contain up to 0.8 % by volume of CO which

is then simultaneously oxidized.
Method according to any one of claims 3 to 8, characterized in that the
said reaction medium may contain up to 10% by volume of water as

vapour.
Method according to any one of claims 3 to 9, characterized in that the
said reaction medium may contain up to 10% by volume of oxygen.
Method according to any one of claims 3 to 10, characterized in that the
said reduction is effected at a temperature lying between 350°C and

500°C.
Utilization of a catalyst consisting of a zeolite of the MFI type having a
Si/Al ratio lying between 15 and 19, exchanged for between 0.3% and

2% by weight of Pd with respect to the total weight of the catalyst for
the reduction of the nitrogen oxides. 
Utilization according to claim 12, characterized in that the said zeolite is
exchanged for 0.5% by weight of Pd.
