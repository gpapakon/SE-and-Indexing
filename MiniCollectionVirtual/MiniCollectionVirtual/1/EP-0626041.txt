<ABSTRACT>
A masonry anchor for use in an undercut hole (2) comprises a nut portion (10) for engagement with an anchor bolt (50) and anchoring segments (14) which can displace resiliently outwardly into engagement with the undercut. The anchor is inserted into the hole by means of a tool (40) engaged with the nut portion. Removal of the tool is prevented if the anchoring segments do not correctly displace outwardly, to ensure that the anchor is usable only if it is correctly set within the undercut.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to masonry anchors and more particularly to so-called
undercut anchors.Undercut anchors are typically used in anchoring situations where the anchor
is likely to be subjected to high stress and failure could be critical. They may, for
example be used to provide an explosion resistant anchorage. Undercut anchors are
also used when anchoring within the tension zone of a concrete slab or beam where the
concrete may be liable to cracking. Generally speaking, previously proposed undercut
anchors operate by interacting with an undercut or enlargement formed within the inner
or base part of a hole drilled into the masonry. In order to ensure correct setting, the
undercut must be correctly formed at the required depth within the hole. As the
undercut is not itself visible from the surface of the masonry an operator must rely on
observation and/or "feel" to determine that the undercut has been correctly formed and
that the anchor is properly set. While some anchors do provide an indication that the
setting is incorrect, nevertheless the anchor may still be usable although the anchorage
strength will be considerably reduced. The incorrect setting of the anchor may,
however, not be apparent on subsequent inspection and therefore inspection staff or
supervisory staff may not be aware that the anchorage will not function to the design
requirements.DE-A-27 30 618 discloses a masonry anchor for use in an undercut hole having
a nut portion and a plurality of segments movable between a contracted configuration
in which the anchor is able to pass through the hole and an expanded configuration in
which the segments displace outwardly into the undercut to provide anchorage within
the undercut. This anchor suffers from the disadvantages discussed above in that it is
not possible to ascertain whether the segments have fully deployed into their expanded
configuration within the undercut.The present invention seeks to provide an undercut anchor which is unusable 
unless it is correctly set.According to the present invention there is provided a masonry anchor for use
in a hole having along its length an undercut formation which tapers in cross-sectional
area in a direction towards the base of the hole with the base end of the undercut being
spaced from the base of the hole to define an end portion of the hole beyond the
undercut, and a larger diameter portion of the undercut being connected to the wall of
the hole outwardly of the undercut by an annular abutment surface which faces towards
the base

A masonry anchor for use in a hole having along its length an undercut formation
which tapers in cross-sectional area in a direction towards the base of the hole with the base

end of the undercut being spaced from the base of the hole to define an end portion of the
hole beyond the undercut, and a larger diameter portion of the undercut being connected to

the wall of the hole outwardly of the undercut by an annular abutment surface which faces
towards the base of the hole, said anchor comprising a nut portion (10) of a size to pass

through the hole and, outwardly of the nut portion (10), an anchor portion (12) comprising
a plurality of segments (14) biased outwardly to move between a contracted configuration in

which the anchor portion is of an outside diameter to pass through the hole and an expanded
configuration in which the segments (14) displace outwardly into the undercut into a

formation which substantially corresponds with that of the undercut, the segments (14) having
an axially outer face (28) adapted to bear against the annular abutment surface of the undercut

in the expanded configuration whereby the segments (14) act as struts in compression to
transfer compressive loading to the annular abutment surface of the undercut when an

anchoring bolt is tightened into the nut portion (10), characterised in that the anchor is
arranged for installation into the hole by being mounted on the tip end of an installation tool (40) having

a shank (44) of reduced cross-sectional size relative to the tip end, and the radially inner surfaces (24,26)
of the segments (14) define a passage through which the tool shank (44) extends, the cross-sectional

size of the passage being less than the thread diameter of the nut portion (10) until the
segments (14) are in their expanded condition to thereby preclude release of the tip end of the tool (40)

from the anchor after installation if the segments (14) are not correctly deployed into their
expanded configuration within the undercut.
A masonry anchor according to claim 1, wherein the nut portion (10)
and anchor portion (12) are capable of being pushed deeper into the hole

causing the segments (14) to move into their contracted configuration
thereby permitting withdrawal of the anchor from the hole. 
A masonry anchor according to claim 2, wherein withdrawal is effected using the tool
(40) and the segments (14) are retained in their retracted position for withdrawal.
A masonry anchor according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in combination with an
anchoring bolt (50) engageable with the nut portion (10), said bolt including means (60)

operable to force the segments (14) into engagement with the undercut when the bolt (50) has
been screwed into the nut portion (10).
A masonry anchor according to claim 4, wherein the means (60) for forcing the
segments (14) into engagement with the undercut is formed by a sleeve (52,60) around a

shank of the bolt (50), the inner end portion of the sleeve being engageable with the internal
surfaces of the segments (14) to force the segments (14) into their fully expanded

configuration.
A masonry anchor according to claim 5, wherein the sleeve (52,60) includes a portion
(62) capable of axial collapse to permit length reduction of the sleeve as the bolt is tightened.
A masonry anchor as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6 in combination with a tool
for insertion of the anchor, wherein the tool (40) comprises a shank (44) arranged to extend

into the hole and having at an inner portion a threaded section (42) for engagement with the
thread of the nut portion (10), said shank (44) being at a position adjacent the threaded section

(42) of a size such that the segments (14) can contract to permit insertion into the hole.
An anchor and tool combination as claimed in claim 7, wherein the tool (40) is also
effective to permit withdrawal of the anchor by engagement of its threaded section (42) with

the nut portion (10) of the anchor, pushing the anchor deeper into the hole to contract the
segments (14) and withdrawing the anchor with the segments (14) being retained in their

retracted state.
