<ABSTRACT>
In a harrow (1) having a large working width, the lateral outer parts of the harrow are folded up into a transport position around folding axes (16a, 16b). In order to protect the joints (14a, 14b) against excessive stresses caused by bending moments, the carrying frame (10) of the harrow (1) is provided with front and rear cross-beams (11 and 12), of which at least the front cross-beam (11) laterally extends beyond the joints (14a, 14b) of the traction beam (3) and is itself provided with joints (14c, 14d), so that it can also be folded. The front cross-beam (11), which is stiffened against bending moments, protects the traction beam (3) in the manner of a bumper or fender. If required, it also absorbs movements contrary to the traction direction (16c) by means of chain sections (15) with which in particular the outer part of the traction beam (3) is suspended from the adjacent outer part (11b, 11c) of the cross-beam. The cross-beam is stiffened by longitudinal members (20a, 20b) that support the outer parts (11b, 11c) of the cross-beam and whose base on the rear cross-beam (12) is in turn braced by traction members (23a, 23b) with respect to the three-point suspension (8) of the tractor (9), so that it cannot move in the opposite direction to the direction of traction (16c).

A harrow, particularly a folding harrow (1) comprising 
a work part (2) capable of being placed on the ground 

and a support frame (7) arranged above said work part 
(2) and capable of being coupled to the three-point 

linkage of a tractor (9), said work part (2) comprising 
a pulling beam (3) provided with a joint portion which 

permits a folding movement of said work part around a 
pivotal axis which extends substantially horizontally 

and in the pull direction of said harrow during operation, 
a middle part (4) comprising clod breaking 

elements (5), and a trailing beam (6), said support 
frame (7) comprising a front traverse (11) and a rear 

traverse (12) connected to each other by means of a 
plurality of longitudinal beams (13a, 13b) arranged 

therebetween,
 
characterised in that
 
at least said front traverse (11) projects outwardly 

beyond said joint portion of said pulling beam (3) and 
comprises at least one joint portion (14c, 14d) 

arranged above and corresponding to said joint portion 
of said pulling beam (3), said joint portion (14c, 14d) 

permitting a pivoting movement of the sections of said 
traverse around a pivotal axis (16), which extends substantially 

horizontally and in the pull direction of 
said harrow during operation, into an upright position 

of the outer traverse section,
 
at least one longitudinal beam (20a, 20b) acts on said 

front traverse (11) at a location laterally outside of 
said joint portion (14c, 14d), and
  
 

the mounting location (22a, 22b) of said longitudinal 
beam (20a, 20b) on said rear traverse (12) is rigged 

against a section (11a, 11d) of said front traverse 
(11) located inwardly from said joint portion by means 

of a tension element (23a, 23b). 
The harrow according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said rear traverse (12) projects outwardly beyond said 

joint portion of said trailing beam (6). 
The harrow according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that its structure is symmetrical with respect to the 

longitudinal center line (17) thereof. 
The harrow according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said joint portions (14c, 

14d and 14e, 14f) of said front and rear traverses (11, 
12) are at least substantially aligned such as to form 

a folding axis (16a and 16b) extending in the pull 
direction (16c) of said harrow. 
The harrow according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said joint portions (14c, 

14d and 14e, 14f) have the form of hinge-type joints, 
the hinge pins of which are coaxial with a respective 

folding axis (16a, 16b). 
The harrow according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said rear traverse (12) 

also constitutes the trailing beam (6) of said harrow. 
The harrow according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said front traverse (11) 

also constitutes the pulling beam (3) of said harrow.  
 
The harrow according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that said tension element 

(23a, 23b) has the form of a chain. 
The harrow according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by adjusting means (30) for said 

tension element (23a, 23b). 
The harrow according to claim 9, characterised in that 
said adjusting means (30) comprises a number of mounting 

locations (31a, 31b) in various positions for 
mounting said tension element (23a, 23b) at various 

rigging lengths. 
The harrow according to claims 8 and 10, characterised 
in that m mounting locations (31a, 31b) each altering 

the rigging length by 1/m of the chain link pitch are 
provided for adjusting the rigging length in m increments. 
The harrow according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a plurality of folding axes 

(16a, 16b) located on either side of said longitudinal 
central line (17) of said harrow. 
The harrow according to claim 12, characterised in that 
each folding axis (16a, 16b) is associated with one 

respective longitudinal beam (13a, 13b) comprising a 
tension element (23a, 23b).
