<ABSTRACT>
2.1 Known control valves for regenerating an absorption element for volatile fuel of an internal combustion engine cannot be controlled in a sensitive manner in certain operating phases. 2.2 To achieve this end, the new control valve has the features that the valve device comprises a valve seat (5) and a valve-closing element (4), these being adjusted independently of one another by the control elements (2, 7). 2.3 The control valve according to the invention allows sensitive control of the quantity of regenerating air in combination with optimum operating behaviour of the internal combustion engine.

<CLAIMS>
Solenoid control valve for the regeneration of an 
absorption element for volatile fuel by means of fresh 

air, consisting of one electromagnetic and one pneumatic 
actuator (3 and 7) which act on a valve device which 

controls an air passage (10, 11), the said valve device 
consisting of a valve seat (5) and a valve-closing 

element (4) which are displaced independently of one 
another by means of the actuators (3 and 7), 

characterized in that the valve seat (5) and valve 
closing element (4) are guided together in a guide sleeve 

(6). 
Control valve according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the guide sleeve (6) has calibration openings 

(15) which connect the interior of the guide sleeve (6) 
to a diaphragm chamber (9) which can be connected to a 

partial vacuum source via a connection (11). 
Control valve according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that there is a separating wall (18) between a chamber 

part (17) which has the connection (11) and the 
calibration openings (15) and a chamber part (16) which 

has the diaphragm (7). 
Control valve according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the chamber parts (16, 17) are connected by means 

of a calibration opening (19). 
Control valve according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the calibration opening (19) is arranged in the 

separating wall (18) or the housing wall (20).
