<ABSTRACT>
A barrier to termites particularly suitable for protecting buildings comprising a mesh (15) made of a material that is resistant to breakdown in the environment of use and is resistant to secretions deposited by termites, such as stainless steel, and is also sufficiently hard to not be attacked by termites, such as having a hardness not less than about Shore D70. The pores of the mesh (15) being dimensioned so the maximum linear dimension in any direction of the pores is less than the maximum linear dimension of the cross section of the head of the species of termite to be controlled. The mesh (15) being installed with respective marginal edges (16, 20) along opposite edges of the two sections of a building structure to prevent the passage of termites therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of termites from attacking
buildings and other structures and, more specifically, to an improvement in or
modification of the techniques for the control of termites in such situations as
disclosed in Australian Patent Specification AU-B-6 201 090, the
disclosure in which is incorporated herein by way of this reference.This prior specification discloses the construction of a termite barrier
and the application thereof to buildings incorporating or supported on a concrete
slab and wherein the termite control is achieved without the use of harmful
chemicals which are currently deemed environmentally unacceptable. More
specifically, there is disclosed in that prior application, a termite barrier material
comprising a mesh sheet of a material resistant to breakdown in the
environment of use and substantially resistant to termite secretions and has a
hardness of not less than about Shore D70, the pores of said mesh having a
linear dimension in any direction less than the maximum linear dimension of the
cross section of the head of the species of termite to be controlled. The above
defined termite barrier material shall be referred to hereinafter as " the termite
barrier material".In the prior patent specification, it has been proposed to underlay the
concrete slab with a continuous layer of the termite barrier material. However, in
view of the strength of concrete slabs and the low probability of cracking thereof,
the technique of underlaying the full extent of the concrete slab with the termite
barrier material, involves a substantial waste of the barrier material and a
consequential increase in the cost of providing the protection against the
intrusion of termites.Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to enable a
building or like structure to be protected against the entry of termites using the
termite barrier material, but in a more economic manner without seriously
impairing the effectiveness of the barrier against the entry of termites to the
building.With the above stated object in view, there is provided according to one aspect of the invention a
combination of a building structure and termite barrier material, the combination being as claimed in the ensuing claim 1 and, according to another aspect of the
invention, a combination of a building structure and termite barrier
material, the combination being as claimed in the ensuing claim 2.According to another aspect of the invention a method of
installing the termite barrier is also provided.

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a building structure incorporating at or
adjacent ground level two non-integral adjacent termite resistant

structural sections and termite barrier material which is resistant to
breakdown in the environment of u
se and substantially resistant to
termite secretions, has a hardness of not less than about Shore D70 for

resistance to termite chewing and is perforated with pores each of
which has a linear dimension in all directions less than the maximum

linear dimension of the cross section of the head of the species of
termite to be controlled, 
characterised in that
 the termite barrier material
is in strip form having respective opposite longitudinal marginal edge

portions (16,20) which are integrally secured to the respective
structural sections (12,19) against the passage of termites

therebetween, at least one of the longitudinal marginal edge portions
(16,20) being adhesively bonded to the respective structural section

(12,19) to provide a termite impervious connection therebetween.
A combination of a building structure incorporating a
ground level or near ground level concrete structure and having a non-integral

termite resistant adjacent structure and termite barrier material
which is resistant to breakdown in the environment of use and

substantially resistant to termite secretions, has a hardness of not less
than about Shore D70 for resistance to termite chewing and is

perforated with pores each of which has a linear dimension in all
directions less than the maximum linear dimension of the cross section

of the head of the species of termite to be controlled, 
characterised in
that
 the termite barrier material is in strip form having respective
opposite longitudinal marginal edge portions (16,20) which are integrally

secured to the concrete structure (19) and the adjacent structure (12)
to establish integrity of the connection between the concrete structure

(19) and the adjacent structure (1 2)against the passage of termites, the
strip form termite barrier material being integrally secured to the

concrete structure and/or to the adjacent structure by being adhesively
bonded thereto to provide a termite impervious connection

therebetween. 
A combination according to claim 2, wherein the adjacent
structure (12) is a lateral or vertical extension of the concrete structure

(19).
A combination according to claim 2, wherein the adjacent
structure (12) is an upstanding wall or structure.
A combination according to claim 2, wherein the adjacent
