<ABSTRACT>
The cleaning of the brewing apparatus (3) of the coffee brewer takes place in various stages. In a first stage, water is fed from a water container, via the water connection (13) of the brewing cylinder (14), through the outflow pipe arranged in the brewing plunger (26), to an external water container. The cleaning water follows the path of the brewed coffee in this stage. In a second stage (see fig. 3), the cleaning water is led from the brewing cylinder (14), via channels (25) arranged in the wall (24) of the brewing cylinder (14), into regions outside the brewing cylinder and cleans, inter alia, the second projecting part (16) for the feeding of the coffee residue to the residue container. In a third stage, by displacing the expelling plunger (19), the water situated in the brewing chamber is caused to flow out over the edge of the brewing cylinder. In a fourth stage, a chemical or biological cleaning agent is introduced into the brewing chamber via the powder shaft, or from a cleaning-agent tank, or from the water tank, or from a cartridge, water then being conveyed into the brewing cylinder, and this process being repeated several times. Lastly, a rinsing operation takes place.

Method of cleaning a brewing device, especially of a coffee machine,
water being conducted for the cleaning process from a water tank (6) or from

an external water supply via a supply line (35) to the water supply connection
(13) of a brewing cylinder (14), characterised in that in at least one cleaning

phase (B) water is conducted through the elements (25) of the brewing cylinder
(14) into areas outside the brewing cylinder (14).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that in one phase (A)
the water is conducted via a water supply connection (13) into the brewing

cylinder (14) and from there via an outlet pipe (22) in a brewing piston (26) to
an external water tank (23), the brewing piston (26) covering up the elements

(25).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that in one phase (C) the water located in the brewing cylinder (14) flows out

over the edge of the brewing cylinder (14) by means of the raised ejection
piston (19) and the simultaneously retracted brewing piston (26).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that in phase (B) or (C) the water is led to an extension piece (16) of the

brewing cylinder (14) for cleaning of the same.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that in one phase (D) a chemical and/or biological cleaning process takes

place.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that in one phase (E) any residue of the cleaning agent is expelled.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that in one phase (F) rinsing takes place.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the individual cleaning phases (A - F) can be carried out in any desired

order and can be repeated.
Cleaning configuration for a brewing device (3), especially of a coffee
machine (1), for carrying out the method according to one of the preceding

claims, with a water tank (1) or an external water supply connection and a
supply pipe (35) to feed the water to the water supply connection (13) of a 

brewing cylinder (14), characterised by elements (25) for conducting the
cleaning water from the brewing cylinder (14) into areas outside the brewing

cylinder.
Cleaning configuration according to claim 9, characterised in that the

elements (25) are designed as grooves or channels on the inner surface (34) of
the wall (24) of the brewing cylinder (14).
Cleaning configuration according to claim 9 or 10, characterised in
that the elements (25) run parallel to the central axis of the brewing cylinder

(14).
Cleaning configuration according to one of the claims 9 to 11,
characterised in that, in the guide (27) for the brewing piston (26), adjacent to

the second extension piece (16) of the brewing cylinder (14), a projection (28,
29) is provided for conducting the rinse water to the extension piece (16).
Cleaning configuration according to one of the claims 9 to 12,
characterised in that the elements (25) are disposed asymmetrically.
Cleaning configuration according to one of the claims 9 to 13,
characterised in that the elements (25) are of differing size.
