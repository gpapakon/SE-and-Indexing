<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stabilizer composition for
processing a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material and particularly to a solid stabilizer composition
for processing a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material, which improved in social and operational
environmental aptitudes and in practical application through
the operational simplification.A silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is
commonly processed by making use of a black-and-white
developer, a fixer, a color developer, a bleacher, a bleach-fixer
and a stabilizer, so that an image can be obtained.
Each of the processing solutions is concentrated into a single 
or plural parts and is then put into a plastic-made bottle,
for the purpose of simplifying the handling the solutions, so
that the solutions are supplied as a kit of the processing
chemicals to the users. A user dissolves the above-mentioned
processing chemical kit in water to prepare a working
solution, a starter solution or a replenishing solution, and
then he uses the working solution.In the field of photographic industry in recent years, a
small-scaled photofinishing laboratories at which a small-sized
automatic processor is used, that is so-called a Mini-Lab.,
have been rapidly increased. With the increase in such
a mini-labs., the quantities of plastic-made bottles for
processing chemical use has also rapidly increased year by
year.The plastics mentioned above have also been used, besides
the bottles for photographic processing chemicals, because of
its light and strong properties. On the other hand, scrapped
plastic pottles cause environmental problems.Therefore, an urgent countermeasure has been required.Under the circumstances such as mentioned above, it is
really unfavorable to use a large amount of plastic-made
bottles of the processing chemicals for photographic use,
though the photographic use is merely a part of the whole
consumption of the plastics.In recent years, rapid processing services have been in
great demand, and the photographic processing operations are 
being transferred from mini-labs to the so-called micro-labs
(or a smaller-scaled mini-lab.). In the conventional labs.,
an operator who has handled a processing chemicals there, has
had a knowledge of processing chemicals. However, with the
transfer of the photographic processing thereto, for example,
a smaller-scaled lab. is introduced into a convenience store
or a drug store, the operations thereof are to be carried out
by one without having any knowledge of processing
