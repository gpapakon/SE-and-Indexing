<DESCRIPTION>
 MATERIAL WORKING AND TOOL CONTROL SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe adjustability of saws and other electric machine tools relative to the surface of a work¬ bench has been a long-stand ng concern in the prior art.More particularly, in applications such as the construction of roof trusses, where numerous members having a variety of different cuts and angles therein must be generated in large numbers, factors such as the mobility, portability, ease of adjustability and re-positioning of the tool, and weight of the system, are all important factors. 

 Wh le numerical control machines have become common-place n many mach ne toc~1 areas, for example, machine drills, lathes, files, etching devices, and many other areas, a suitable numerical (or computer) control machine suitable for use with a power saw at a construction site in which the cutting of many wood members, having various angles, as in a roof truss structure, has not appeared in any practical or economic form.Those efforts along these lines, known to the inventor, include a programmable turntable manufactured by Speed Cut, Inc., of Corvallis, Oregon 97339, and the so-called SPIDA Radial Saw, also manufactured by Speed Cut. Comparable products are offered by a handful of other companies around the world.Systems such as those of Speed Cut, Inc. involve considerable weight, occupy a large volume and ground area, are heavy, costly, are *not easy to adjust or program, an are time-consuming to maintain. Also, they are not as easy or convenient to work with in the field as might be desired. 

 At a more technical level, systems such as those of Speed Cut make use of articulated arms which extend directly from a rotatable workbench associated with the cutting system. The short¬ coming of this structure is that vertical loads upon the arms are transmitted to a rotatable workbench. Therefore a particularly robust structure is required, with the costs attendant thereto. Also, achievement of proper registration between the cutting tool and the workpiece is complex where the workpiece is secured to a rotating workbench. That is, loads on vertical bearings are not evenly distributed, this degrading accuracy of the saw blade. Understandably, systems of the above type also impart considerable wear on their moving parts.It is, therefore, as a response to the above set forth long-felt need in the prior art that the invention is directed.

THE CLAIMS
Having thus described my invention what I claim as new, useful and non-obvious and, accordingly, secure by Letters Patent of the United States is:
1. A material-working and tool control system for use with a workbench having a substantially planar surface, the system comprising:
(a) a system platform in rotatable communication with said surface of said workbench through an axis-of-rotation normal to said surface;
(b) a tool-carrying platform;
(c) first protractor means having first and second co-planar legs, each leg thereof having a hinged end and an opposite end, said hinged ends having a hinge there¬ between in which an included angle of said protractor means, within a first plane, is adjustable through said hinge between said first and second legs, said 


 17
opposite end of said first leg in pivotal communication with said workbench through an axis-of-rotation normal to said work¬ bench surface, and said opposite end of said second leg in rotational communica¬ tion with said tool-carrying platform through an axis-of-rotation normal to said work-bench surface, in which a two- dimensional elliptical arc of rotation is defined by the position of said opposing end of said second leg following said adjustment of said hinge between said hinged ends of said legs; and
(d) second protractor'means having first and second co-planar legs, each leg thereof having a hinged end and an opposite end, said hinged ends having a hinge there¬ between in which an included angle of said second protractor means, within a plane normal to said plane of said first protractor means, is adjustable through said hinge between said first and second 


 legs, said opposite end of said first leg in pivotal communication with said rotatable platform through an axis-of- rotation co-parallel to said workbench surface and said opposing end of said second leg in rotational communication with said tool-carrying platform through an axis-of-rotation co-parallel with said workbench surface, in which said opposite end of said second leg will traverse a two-dimensional elliptical arc of rotation within said plane of said second protractor means, defined by adjustment of said hinge thereof in a plane defined by the position of said rotatable system platform,
whereby the position of said tool-carrying platform is defined by the three-dimensional intersection of said two-dimensional ellip¬ tical arcs of rotation formed by movement of said opposite ends of said second legs of each of said first and second protractor means and said hinges associated therewith. 


 2. The system as recited in Claim 1, further comprising:
a base platform in fixed communication with said surface of said workbench in which said first leg of said first protractor means is, at said opposite end thereof, in rotational communication with said base platform through an axis-of-rotation normal to said workbench surface.
3. The system as recited in Claim 2 in which said axis-of-rotation of said rotatable platform passes through said base platform.
4. The system as recited in Claim 1 in which said tool-carrying platform includes a circular power saw.
5. The system as recited in Claim 4 in which said surface of said workbench includes a miter box within which materials to be cut by said circular saw may be appropriately positioned prior to cutting. 


 6. The system as recited in Claim 2 in which said rotatable platform is positioned at an elevation, relative to the workbench above said tool-carrying platform such that said tool-carrying platform is vertically positioned between said workbench and said rotatable platform.
7. The system as recited in Claim 2 further comprising a position adjustable material- working stop upon said workbench surface, said stop including a slot through which a cutting element of a tool positioned upon said tool- carrying platform may pass.
8. The system as recited in Claim 7 in which said slot of said stop is positioned substantially above said axis-of-rotation of said rotatable platform.
