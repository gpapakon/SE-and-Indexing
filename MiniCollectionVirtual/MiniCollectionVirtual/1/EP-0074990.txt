<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling noxious insects which lay their eggs on standing crops by providing in the area of the crops a light flow the light intensity of which is varied, with cyclic repetition, gradually between a minimum and a maximum, the light intensity returning momentarily between two succeeding cycles.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD OF CONTROLLING NOXIOUS INSECTSThe invention relates to a method o f controlling noxious insects which lay their eggs on standing crops. By studying the behaviour of insects it has been found that the inclination to oviposition of the females of night-active insects, said oviposition with few exceptions taking place in the night, is influenced i.a. by the moonlight which has an inhibiting effect on the oviposition such that the oviposition activity is greater in dark nights than when the nights are bright due to moonlight. This phenomenon is explained in more detail in Ent. Scand. 5. 1974. 196-206 and in Bull. ent. Res. 66. 1976. 33-63. Considering these facts, the method proposed accord¬ ing to the invention has obtained the characteristics according to claim 1.When the method according to the invention is applied, the insects are controlled without being catched or killed by the cyclically repeated light variations affecting the insects in the same manner as the moonlight: the females will be less inclined to lay their eggs on the crops located in the varying light flow and thus these crops will not in a greater or less degree be eaten by the insect larvae.It is important that the light intensity varies slowly from a minimum, preferably zero, to a maximum, and it is important as well that the light momentarily returns from the maximum to the minimum, because the insects adapt themselves to a constant light or a uniform, e.g. sinusoidal, light variation. The period between the minimum and the maximum may be e.g. 20 sec. It is not necessary, however, that the light flow as a whole is cyclically varied; only a component of the light flow may be cyclically varied.O PI / >- WIPO ~
 The slowly varying light flow can be provided by means of an artificial light source which is controlled or supplied by a solid state sweep circuit which can be of an embodiment known in the field of electronics. By the inclination to oviposition of the insects being reduced due to the cyclically varying light flow, the area which is illuminated by this light flow also w ll accommodate fewer insects flying around, because the insects will not go to the illuminated area in order to lay their eggs there. .However, it has been found as well that also the mating inclination of night-active insects can be reduced by a varying light flow, but a light flow having an opposite cyclic variation i.e. the light intensity decreases gradually from a maximum to a minimum (zero value) and is then momentarily returned to the maximum.
