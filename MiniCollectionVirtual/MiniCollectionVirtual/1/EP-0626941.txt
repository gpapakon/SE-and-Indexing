<ABSTRACT>
beta , beta -dialkyl and  beta , beta , beta -trialkyl  alpha -amino acids are prepared by a novel route involving the reaction and molecular rearrangement of acetoamidoacrylate tricarbonyl iron complexes in the presence of a lithium alkyl. This novel route opens up the possibility of an inexpensive route to highly branched  alpha -amino acids some of which have not previously been reported in the literature.

 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF β.β-DIALKYL AND β,β,β-TRIALKYL -AMINO ACIDSFIELD OF INVENTION5 This invention concerns a novel route for the preparation of β,β-Ik dialkyl and β,β,β-trialkyl α-amino acids, especially the latter.BACKGRODNDHighly branched α-amino acids having branching at the β -carbon10 atom, such as tert.-leucine, viz: (CH-s)2CCH(NH2)COOH, are valuable chemicals with many uses in the chemical, biochemical and medical fields. However they are difficult to prepare by known chemical methods.15 OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONThe object of the invention is to provide an improved route for the chemical synthesis of branched chain α-amino acids with branching at the β-carbon atom.20 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that such highly branched amino acids are surprisingly obtained in high yield by the reaction of a tertiary or secondary alkyl halide, preferably a bromide or iodide, with an alkyl, preferably lower (C^-Co) 25 alkyl 2-acetamido acrylate tricarbonyl iron complex in the presence of a lithium alkyl.DETAILED DESCRIPTIONThe reaction of this invention may be represented by the 30 equation: 
2-acetamidoacrylate tricarbonyl iron complex H2N. ^C02H (I)CHR* IIIwhere R = alkyl, preferably lower (C^-Co) alkyl, most preferably methyl; R' = tertiary or secondary alkyl, preferably (Cβ'Cir secondary or tertiary alkyl, e.g. isopropyl, sec. butyl, tert.butyl 1 , 1-dimethyl-n-propyl , 1 , 1-dimethyl-n-butyl etc.; X = halogen, e.g. chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably bromine or iodine. As will be apparent, the reaction is carried out using readily available starting materials, which are commercially available, as such, or which can themselves easily be prepared by standard organic syntheses. The 2-acetamidoacrylate tricarbonyl iron complex is readily available, for example, by reacting the commercially available 2- acetamidoacrylic acid with methyl iodide (or other alkyl halide or suitable alkylating agent) to produce the corresponding ester, e.g. methyl 2-acetamidoacrylate, which is then reacted with di-iron nonacarbonyl , Fe2(C0)g, to give the air stable, crystalline methyl 2- acetaraidoacrylate iron tricarbonyl complex in high yield.In the initial stage of the two stage reaction procedure of the present invention, the alkyl 2-acetamidoacrylate tricarbonyl iron complex I is reacted with the lithium alkyl to produce an as yet undetermined intermediate, presumably involving an alkyl lithium attack on the metal carbonyl ligand and possibly an acyl
