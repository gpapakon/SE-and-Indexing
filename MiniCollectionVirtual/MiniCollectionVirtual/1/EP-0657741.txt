<ABSTRACT>
A cable management system which provides routing of 
wired services between service lines (16) and user lines 

(18). Each service line (16) enters the cable system at a 
service termination unit circuit card (22) which also 

holds a portion of a crosspoint switch matrix. 
Each user line (18) enters the system at a line termination 

unit circuit card (20). The service termination unit 
circuit cards (22) are all mounted to connectors (36) on a 

first side of a centerplane board (24) and the line 
termination unit circuit cards (2) are mounted to connectors 

(36) on the other side of the centerplane board. Pins 
(37) extending through the centerplane board (24) interconnect 

the connectors (36) on the opposed sides of the centerplane 
board (24) so that any service line (16) can be connected to any 

user line (18). A system controller card (26) mounted to the 
centerplane board (24) communicates with the circuit cards via 

a bus on the centerplane board (24). A line test circuit 
card (50) is mounted to one of the connectors on the 

first side of the centerplane board (24). The line test 
circuit card (50) contains a test unit (54) and a crosspoint 

switch matrix (146) so that the test unit can be 
connected to any of the user lines (18) in order to run tests 

of that user line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cable management system 
which provides routing of telephony, low and high speed 
data, power and video, between service lines and user 
lines under computer control and, more particularly, to 
such a system wherein testing of the user lines can be 
remotely effected by the system operator. When wiring a commercial building, it is 
conventional that all of the services carried by wire, 
such as telephony, low and high speed data, power and 
video, enter the building for termination at respective 
patch panels. The patch panels are typically located 
within wiring closets and include a first array of 
terminations for the service lines which enter the 
building and a second array of terminations for the user 
lines which extend within the building to various user 
stations. Within each patch panel, the connections 
between the service lines and the user lines are made 
manually via jumper wires extending between the first 
array of terminations and the second array of 
terminations. In an ideal situation, records would be 
maintained as to where each wire goes within the building 
and to what it is connected. However, since the real 
world is not ideal, such records are not always properly 
maintained. In addition, wires are often tagged at the 
patch panels and the tags are lost or become outdated 
because of lack of updating. Therefore, when a 
technician is given a service order to add, move or 
change a connection, the technician must first determine 
exactly which physical wires are involved. This has 
proven to be a very time consuming and labor intensive 
chore. It has been proposed to provide a cable 
management system with automatic record keeping  
 
capability. The proposed cable management system is interposed 
between a plurality of service lines and a plurality of 
user lines and includes a plurality of line termination 
unit circuit cards which provide connections to the user 
lines and a plurality of service termination unit circuit 
cards which provide connections to the service lines. 
Controllable switching means are coupled between the 
terminations to the user lines and the service lines for 
selectively providing physical electrical connections 
between selected ones of the service lines and selected 
ones of the user lines. A controller is provided to 
control the switching means to selectively make and open 
connections between the service lines and the user lines 
in accordance with received commands, the controller 
having a memory in which is stored
