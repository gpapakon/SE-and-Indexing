<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for preparing a nitrogen or oxygen
containing organoalkoxysilane such as an isocyanurate or fumarate by

reacting a haloalkylalkoxysilane such as a
chloropropyltrimethoxysilane and a reactant of either a cyanate or an

ammonium salt of an organic acid of C1-C20 carbon atoms or a metal
salt of an organic acid of C1-C20 carbon atoms or mixtures thereof at a

reaction temperature of at least about 80°C to about 200°C, comprising
carrying out the reaction in the presence of a guanidinium salt phase as a

transfer catalyst such as hexaethylguanidinium chloride. Preferably the
temperature increase from the exotherm reaction above the reaction

temperature ranges from about 0°C to about 120°C. A preferred metal
cyanate is sodium cyanate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process of preparing
certain organosilanes, particularly organoalkoxysilanes by reacting a
certain silylorganohalide, particularly a haloalkylalkoxysilane, with
certain chemical reactants in the presence of a guanidinium salt as a
phase transfer catalyst at elevated temperatures.The use of tetraalkylammonium and
hexaalkylguanidinium salts as phase transfer catalysts in the
preparation of various polymers is known. In particular, US Patent
5,132,423 discloses the reaction of bisphenol salts with halo- or
nitro-substituted phthalimides in an organic medium to produce
bisimides which, upon conversion to dianhydrides and reaction with
diamines, form polyetherimides. US Patent 5,229,482 discloses a
similar phase transfer catalyst reaction of bisphenol salts with halo- or
nitro-substituted bis(phthalimido) derivatives of aromatic diamines or
with similar compounds, resulting in the direct formation of
polyetherimides and other polyether polymers. The phase transfer
catalysts employed according to 5,132,423 and 5,229,482 are
guanidinium salts and especially hexaalkylguanidinium salts.There are four general methods for the synthesis of an
organoalkoxysilane compound:
1. Hydrosilylation of allyl- or vinyl-functional compound
with trialkoxysilane.2. Hydrosilylation of allyl- or vinyl-functional compound
with trichlorosilane and subsequent alcoholysis. 3. Reaction of chloropropyltrimethoxysilane with a
sodium or potassium salt of organic acid.4. Reaction of an aminoalkylsilane with a carbonate to
form the product via the carbamate.US Patent 3,517,001 discloses the first method and cites
that isocyanurate-organosilanes have been prepared in the past by
adding hydrosilanes to unsaturated isocyanates and more specifically
allyl isocyanate in the presence of metal catalysts. This process is
limited on a large scale because the hydrosilanes are expensive and
the unsaturated isocyanates are typically highly toxic.The first method suffers from many practical problems
such as a slow hydrosilylation process, formation of byproducts
containing internal olefins, use of toxic and low flash point reagents
such as trimethoxy- or triethoxysilane.The second method is described in US Patent 4,281,145.
It teaches that bis(3-trimethoxysilylpropyl) fumarate can be made by
the hydrosilylation of diallyl maleate with trichlorosilane and
subsequent methoxylation of the trichlorosilyl compound to the desired
product. Unfortunately, the handling of trichlorosilane is very
dangerous due to the low boiling
