<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lead frame 
structure used to produce a semiconductor package 
device. A lead frame structure used to produce a semiconductor 
package device generally comprises a die pad on 
which the semiconductor chip is mounted and a metal 
frame having a number of tongue segments which is to 
become leads of the semiconductor package device. The 
die pad is connected to the frame by linear members 
called "die pad supports". When a semiconductor chip is packaged using the 
lead frame structure to form a semiconductor package 
device, the semiconductor chip is first fixed (mounted) 
to the die pad. This step is generally called "die 
bonding". Electrode pads of the semiconductor chip are then 
connected to the distal ends of the tongue segments of 
the metal frame by gold wires. This step is generally 
called "wire bonding". The lead frame structure on which the semiconductor 
chip is mounted is inserted into a cavity, in which the 
lead frame structure is molded (resin-sealed). As a 
result, the semiconductor chip, the die pad, the wire 
and the distal ends of the tongue segments are coated 
with a molding resin. This step is generally called  
 
"molding". The resulting structure, made of the molding 
resin, is called a package. The tongue segments are then cut off from the 
frame, and thereafter those portions of the leads which 
project from the package are shaped into predetermined 
shapes, thereby forming the "outer leads" of a semiconductor 
package device. Finally, the portion of the die pad support, which 
projects from the package, is cut off, thereby cutting 
off the package from the metal frame. Through the above steps, a semiconductor package 
device is completed. In recent years, as semiconductor package devices 
have become thinner and thinner, and semiconductor 
chips to be mounted on the semiconductor package devices 
have become bigger and bigger, the following problems 
arise. First, the die pad must be greater in accordance 
with the increase of the size of a semiconductor chip. 
In this case, if the number of die pad supports is small 
and cannot sufficiently support the die pad, the die pad 
may bend, i.e., become less flat, during the die bonding 
or wire bonding steps. As a result, wires used in the 
wire bonding step cannot be bonded to the die pad, so 
that the manufacturing yield may become reduced. This problem can be overcome by increasing the 
number of die pad supports for supporting the die pad, 
in order to increase the force for supporting the die
