<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for transferring printed circuit boards from a first transport plane to a second transport plane having approximately the same level by means of a rotatable fan store with fans attached radially relative to the axis of rotation. The known fan stackers of this type can transfer only rigid printed circuit boards and, moreover, are not designed to bridge a build-up. These disadvantages are eliminated by means of the method according to the invention, in that printed circuit boards (6) arriving on the first transport plane (1) are pushed into the fans (4, 5) of the fan store (3) which rotate one step further after each feed. A gripper (8) controlled by the unloading station (7) of the second transport plane (2) extracts, in each case, the foremost fan (4), equipped with a printed circuit board (6), in the entry/exit zone and guides it to the unloading station (7). It brings the empty fan (5) to the last free place on the fan store (3) below the transport planes (1, 2). It subsequently delivers the next fed fan (4) to the unloading station (7). As a result of this method, a control of any build-up during the transfer of printed circuit boards is achieved. Moreover, this method and the arrangement for it are also suitable for printed circuit boards having thin cores.
