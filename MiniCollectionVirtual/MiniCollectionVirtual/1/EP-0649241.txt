<ABSTRACT>
A device for transmitting call and occupation state signals between a key-controlled multi-line telephone system for alternate or simultaneous loudspeaking communication which has a central switching device, and a second system of this type or an individual subscriber device for a system of this type over a two-wire long distance line. Each of the two systems is connected to the two-wire line (FL) via a line concentrator which contains a computer (1) which, on the one hand, controls a pre-defined number of line input circuits (E) and line output circuits (A) and, on the other hand, controls a modem (3) which is connected to the two-wire line (FL), in such a way that a modulated AF control signal is allocated to each call or occupation state signal arriving as a DC signal via the line input circuits and is fed to the long-distance line (FL) using time division multiplexing, and a call or occupation state signal which is to be transmitted as a DC signal is allocated to each modulated AF control signal fed via the long-distance line (FL) to the modem (3) in the line output circuits (A).
