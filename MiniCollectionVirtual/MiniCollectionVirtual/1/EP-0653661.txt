<ABSTRACT>
An optical isolator (10) includes first and second groups (10.1, 10.2) of 
optical elements arranged in tandem on a common axis (13). Each group comprises a 

pair of birefringent wedges (14.1, 16.1; 14.2, 16.2) and a non-reciprocal rotator 
(12.1, 12.2). The design includes means (16.1, 14.2; 38) for interchanging the 

identities of the ordinary and extraordinary rays between the two groups. In one 
embodiment, the output wedge (16.1) of the first group and the input wedge (14.2) of 

the second group are designed so that their C-axes are essentially perpendicular. In 
another embodiment, a polarization rotator (38) is disposed between the two groups. 

This design effectively reduces the propagation delay between the ordinary and 
extraordinary rays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical isolator designed to reduce 
polarization mode dispersion; i.e., to reduce the propagation delay between the 
ordinary and extraordinary rays. Reflections in optical systems often generate noise and optical feedback 
which may degrade the performance of various system components, particularly 
signal sources such as semiconductor lasers. Therefore, the ability to optically 
isolate lasers and other sensitive components from these reflections is often critical 
to the performance of the system. In general, a conventional optical isolator 
comprises a non-reciprocal rotator (e.g., 45° Faraday rotator encased within a bias 
magnet) disposed between a pair of polarization selectors (e.g., linear polarizers, 
birefringent plates, or birefringent wedges). Input signals passing through the 
isolator in the transmitting, forward direction are essentially fully coupled through 
the polarization selector and Faraday rotator to the output device (e.g., fiber). 
However, the polarization of reflected signals passing through the isolator in the 
reflecting, reverse direction is rotated such that essentially none of the reflections are 
coupled back into the signal source. A common isolator design includes a Faraday rotator slab disposed 
between a pair of birefringent wedges. See, for example, W. Emkey et al., Proc.OFC, Abstract THF2 (1989). Under certain conditions, this design is effective in 
reducing the polarization dependence of the isolator. However, because the wedges 
are birefringent, the input beam is split into ordinary rays (o-rays) and extraordinary 
rays (e-rays), which have orthogonal polarizations. The o-rays and e-rays travel over 
paths of different length through the isolator and, hence, are delayed relative to one 
another. This phenomenon is known as polarization mode dispersion (PMD), where 
the term mode refers to the polarization state of the beam. Although the magnitude 
of this delay may be only on the order of a few picoseconds, for some applications it 
may still be a problem. A need remains, therefore, for an optical isolator which not only is 
polarization independent, but also has reduced PMD. Reduced polarization mode dispersion in an optical isolator is achieved 
in an arrangement which includes first and second optical element groups located in 
tandem along a common axis and means for interchanging the identity of the e-rays  
 
and o-rays between the first and second groups. In one embodiment the interchange 
is accomplished by making
