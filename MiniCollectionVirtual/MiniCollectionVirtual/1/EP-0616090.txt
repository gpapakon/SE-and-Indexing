<ABSTRACT>
Buildings comprising steel support structures are very much at risk in the event of a fire. Under the action of the heat which arises, they quickly lose their load-bearing capacity and they collapse. In order to protect such support structures, refractory linings and the introduction, into the steel sections, of plastic hoses filled with thickened water are both known. Instead of this, it is proposed to shut off the hollow bodies of the support-structure elements (1, 2) in a liquid-tight and pressure-tight manner, to fill them with water in the liquid state and to provide them with vapour-outlet valves (25).

<CLAIMS>
Supporting framework comprising a supporting framework
element made from metal and having a hollow section (4) in

the cavity (5, 5', 20) of which a fire protection agent is
disposed, wherein the cavity (5, 5', 20) of the supporting

framework element is sealed in a pressure-tight and
liquid-tight manner and the fire protection agent is water

(7, 23) in its liquid state, the water (7, 23) at least
partially filling the cavity (5, 5', 20), the supporting

framework element having at least one steam release valve
(25), characterized in that the steam release valve (25)

supports a steam jet nozzle (26).
Supporting framework according to claim 1, characterized
in that the steam jet nozzle (26) is disposed for pivoting

on the steam release valve (25).
Supporting framework according to claim 2, characterized
in that a pivot mechanism is provided for causing directed

periodic movement of the steam jet nozzle (26) in response
to the action of the escaping steam.
