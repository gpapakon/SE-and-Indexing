<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a sanitary fitting (1) which can be actuated without contact and has a water outlet, connected to a water line, and a shut-off valve provided upstream of said water outlet. The shut-off valve can be actuated, by means of a control circuit, in dependence on the signals of an approach-sensitive sensor device. For simpler handling and in order to eliminate basin reflections, in each case one sensor is provided on each of the two sides of the vertical symmetry plane of the fitting (1). The operative ranges (9) of the sensors, namely the transmission cones, are arranged such that they do not pick up the outgoing water jet (3). The sensors of the right-hand side and left-hand side operate independently of one another.

Sanitary fitting (2) which operates without contact, with
a water outlet connected to a water pipe and a shut-off valve

which is connected upstream thereof and can be operated by a
control circuit as a function of the signals from an approach-sensitive

sensor device, characterized in that the sensor
device comprises at least two sensors (4, 6) and (5, 6) which

act independently of one another and of which the regions of
action (8, 9) are arranged on both sides of the vertical plane

of symmetry (7) of the sanitary fitting (2) such that they do
not detect the issuing water jet (3).
Sanitary fitting according to claim 1, characterized in
that the regions of action (8, 9) of the two sensors diverge.
Sanitary fitting according to claim 1, characterized in
that the sensors each have a transmitter (4 and 5) and a

common receiver (6) arranged between the transmitters.
Sanitary fitting according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the transmitters (4, 5) emit

infrared rays.
