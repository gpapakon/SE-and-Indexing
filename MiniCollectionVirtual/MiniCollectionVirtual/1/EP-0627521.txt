<ABSTRACT>
A steel cord (12) having steel filaments (2) twisted so as to 
have a final twist pitch, is subjected to 


a step (i) of plastically deforming the steel filaments (2) 
by overtwisting the steel cord (12) until a twist pitch which 

is smaller than the final twist pitch, 
a step (ii) of untwisting the steel cord (12) until the final 
twist pitch, 
a step (iii) of further untwisting the steel cord (12) until 
a twist pitch which is greater than the final twist pitch, 
a step (iv) of twisting the steel cord (12) again to its 
final twist pitch. 
 
Steps (i) and (ii) are done under a first tension and steps 

(iii) and (iv) are done under a second tension, the second 
tension is lower than half the first tension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of treatment of a 
steel cord adapted for the reinforcement of rubber products, 
wherein the steel cord comprises steel filaments (see e.g. GB-A- 2 028 393). Steel cords are widely known and used for the reinforcement 
of rubber products such as tyres, conveyor belts, timing 
belts and hoses. In order to fulfill their reinforcement function in a proper 
way, the steel cords must have a high tensile strength, a 
sufficient resistance to compression once embedded in rubber, 
a good fatigue and corrosion resistance, a sufficient adhesion 
to rubber and a high impact resistance. Besides these 'first' properties, which all relate to the 
behaviour of steel cord in a rubber matrix, the rubber 
industry, and more particularly the tyre industry, requires 
other properties the steel cords must have. These other 
properties, in contradistinction with the first properties, 
all relate to the processability of the steel cords when 
handling the steel cords during the manufacture of e.g. 
tyres. Examples of these 'second' properties are absence of 
residual torsions, straightness, absence of flare, ... Both the first and second properties are supposed to be fulfilled 
between narrow specified limits. It is a difficult 
task, if not a rather impossible one, for a cord manufacturer 
to meet all these requirements. 
This task is thwarted by the fact that, during the entire 
process of manufacturing of a steel cord, the result of 
measures taken to meet one property is wholly or partially 
nullified by measures taken in order to meet another property 
in the downstream part of the process. The consequence is 
that a compromise must be sought or that one or more properties 
must be sacrified in favour of the other properties.  
 As a matter of a first example, part of the tensile strength 
of the steel filaments gets lost during the subsequent twisting 
process. 
As a matter of a second example, part of the degree of preforming 
may be lost during the downstream false twisting or 
during the downstream straightening. It is an object of the present invention to facilitate the 
meeting of some steel cord properties. 
It is another object of the present invention to make the 
attainment of some steel cord properties independent of the 
attainment of other steel cord properties. 
It is still another object of the present invention to provide 
for a process of manufacturing a high-elongation steel 
cord which has a controllable amount of residual torsions and 
which has a
