<ABSTRACT>
A multi-mode piezoelectric filter comprises a 
piezoelectric substrate (2) made of a LiTaO₃ single crystal, a 

plurality of spaced electrodes (3,4) which are formed adjacently 
on a front major surface of the substrate, and a counter 

electrode (11) which is formed on a rear major surface of the 
substrate in opposition to the spaced electrodes. The 

spaced electrodes and the counter electrode coact with the 
intervening portion of the substrate to form two or more 

energy trapped type multi-mode filter elements vibrating in 
the thickness shear mode such that the filter elements are 

coupled to form a cascade connection. Damping material 
such as silicone gel is applied at least on the filter 

elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-mode
piezoelectric filter.In recent years, a filter used in a MHz frequency range
having a wide bandwidth of the passband and high
temperature stability of frequency has been required in the
market of a communication device or the like. A multi-mode
filter is generally employed in the MHz frequency range
since it is able to reduce spurious response and is easy to
be manufactured. In general, this filter is made of
material such as piezoelectric ceramics or quartz crystal.When a multi-mode filter is made of piezoelectric
ceramics, however, it is difficult to obtain high
temperature stability, since its frequency greatly varies
in relation to temperature in a practical temperature range
(- 20° C to 80 ° C).On the other hand, a multi-mode filter made of quartz
crystal has excellent temperature stability. However, it
is difficult for this filter to satisfy the requirement in
the market of the communication device since its bandwidth
is too narrow. JP-A-88,161,863 relates to a LiTaO3 thickness-shear vibrator
having a main body which is composed of a LiTaO3 single crystal
and formed in a strip shape. The thickness-shear vibrator is
set on a flat surface which both main surfaces are extended in
a direction right-angled to the X-axis. A lengthwise direction
of the thickness-shear vibrator is set in a range which the
angle measured from the Y-axis in a clockwise direction is
56.5° to 57.5°. The lengthwise direction of the oscillator is
made to approximately coincide with a cleavage plane.Starting from this prior art, it is the object of the present
invention to provide a multi-mode piezoelectric filter having
high temperature stability and a wide band width in the MHz
frequency range which can reduce spurious response and improve
group delay characteristics.This object is achieved by a piezoelectric filter according to
claim 1. The LiTaO3 single crystal, which is one of
piezoelectric single crystals, has small temperature
coefficient of frequency as compared with piezoelectric
ceramics, and a large electromechanical coupling factor as
compared with quartz crystal, i.e. coupling factor k15 = 46,
temperature coefficient Tc =2 ppm/° C in LiTaO3 single
crystal. Therefore, a filter made of the LiTaO3 single
crystal is superior in temperature characteristics to that
made of piezoelectric ceramics, and wider in bandwidth than
that made of quartz crystal.In the LiTaO3 single crystal, unwanted vibration is
easily excited so as to increase a spurious response.
Therefore, a
