<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for evenly distributing a pourable material on an underlying surface (7) moving in one conveying direction, which material is supplied from a delivery point (2) arranged above the underlying surface, during which firstly a metered delivery of a material stream (3) over the entire spreading width, extending transversely to the conveying direction, onto an evening-out device (4) arranged between the underlying surface and the delivery point takes place, which evening-out device consists of a plurality of transporting elements (5) which are arranged one behind the other in the transporting direction and between which partial streams of the material are discharged over the entire spreading width to the underlying surface (7). In order to achieve a particularly high spreading quality, provision is made for a plurality of partial quantities of equal size over the entire spreading width and of equal material density to be formed, evened out and spread over the underlying surface (7) in a finely metered manner by means of the evening-out device (4), between in each case two transporting elements (5).

Method of uniformly distributing free-flowing material onto a
support which is moved in a conveying direction, the said material being

delivered from a feed point disposed above the support, wherein first of
all metered feeding of a stream of material takes place over the entire

scattering width, which extends perpendicular to the conveying direction,
onto an equalising device which is disposed between the support and the

feed point and consists of a plurality of transport elements disposed one
behind the other in the transport direction, between which part-streams of

the material are discharged over the entire scattering width to the
support, characterised in that by suitable setting of the transport

characteristics of the transport elements by means of the equalising
device (4) a plurality of part-quantities (9) of the same magnitude over

the entire scattering width and the same material density are formed
between each pair of transport elements, equalised and scattered,

precisely metered, onto the support (7).
Method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the transport
elements (5) of the equalising device (4) have different transport

characteristics.
Apparatus for uniformly distributing free-flowing material onto a
support which is moved in a conveying direction, the said material being

delivered from a feed point disposed above the support, wherein first of
all metered feeding of a stream of material takes place over the entire

scattering width, which extends perpendicular to the conveying direction,
onto an equalising device which is disposed between the support and the

feed point and consists of a plurality of transport elements disposed one

behind the other in the transport direction, between which part-streams of
the material are discharged over the entire scattering width to the

support, characterised in that by suitable setting of the transport 
characteristics of the transport elements by means of the equalising

device (4) a plurality of part-quantities (9) of the same magnitude over
the entire scattering width and the same material density are formed

between each pair of transport elements (5) and scattered, precisely
metered, onto the support (7).
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that the
transport elements (5) of the equalising device (4) are formed by

transport rollers which rotate in the same direction and/or conveyor
belts, the longitudinal axes of which extend perpendicular to the

conveying direction (8) of the support.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the
transport elements (5) are movable in the direction of their longitudinal

axes so as to vibrate.
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that
the transport elements (5) can be operated at differing conveying powers.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in that the
transport elements (5) have different profiling.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 6 or 7, characterised in that the
transport elements (5) are operated at circumferential speeds which differ

from one another.
Apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the transport elements (5) are at different distances from the

horizontal.
Apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the transport elements (5) are disposed so that they are graduated 

in the form of steps in the transport direction, two transport elements
(5a, 5b) in each case being disposed at the same height.
Apparatus as claimed in one of Claims 4 to 9, characterised in that
the transport elements (5) of the equalising device (4) are combined into

at least two groups, with which are associated in each case a common frame
(11) in which they are mounted, at least one frame being capable of being

driven so as to vibrate.
Apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that at least one scattering roller (13) for separation is disposed

between the feed point (2) and the support (7).
Apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that an air separation takes place between the feed point (2) and the

support (7).
