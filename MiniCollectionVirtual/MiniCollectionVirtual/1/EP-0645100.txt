<ABSTRACT>
Sports shoe, in particular ski boot, which is designed with front entry (9) and the sole (2) and the upper part (3) of which are moulded from plastic and which, in the instep region, has two pressure distribution plates (5, 6) which are arranged on the outside of the upper part, which run from the toe region of the shoe, over the instep region and, bent upwards, along the front side of the shoe shaft, which are mounted displaceably in the front foot region of the upper part (3) in relation to the latter in the longitudinal direction of the shoe and movably in the transverse direction of the shoe and which overlap one another in the closed state of the shoe. At least one of the pressure distribution plates (5, 6) is mounted in the instep region with one or more hinges (14, 25, 13, 15) on the upper part of the shoe, which make possible a pivoting movement of this pressure distribution plate away from the other pressure distribution plate for opening or exposing the entry (9).

<CLAIMS>
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, provided with a 
front entrance (9) and having its sole (2) and its upper 

part (3) formed of plastic, and provided at its instep portion 
(4) with two load distribution flaps (5,6) disposed on 

the outer side of said upper portion (3) to extend from the 
toe portion (7) of the boot over said instep portion and, 

with an upward curvature, along the front side of the leg 
portion (8) of the boot, and mounted at the forward foot 

portion (10) of said upper part (3) for displacement relative 
thereto in the longitudinal direction (21) of the boot, and for movement 

in the transverse direction of the boot, so as to overlap one another in 
the closed condition of the boot, characterized in that at least one of 

said load distribution flaps (5,6) is mounted on said upper part (3) at 
the instep portion (4) thereof by means of one or several hinges (14,15; 

26,28; 38,39) permitting said load distribution flap (5) to swing away 
from the other load distribution flap (6) for opening, or giving access 

to, respectively, said front entrance (9). 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said hinges are formed by pivot arms (14,15) belonging 

to toggle link buckles provided for closing the boot, and having at 
least one of said load distribution flaps (5,6) of the respective boot 

secured thereto. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 2, characterized 
in that an additional pivot arm (14) is associated to the 

toggle link portion (12) of each of said toggle link buckles (11) 
mounted on the one side of said upper part (3) of the boot, said one 

load distribution flap (5) of the respective boot being attached to 
said pivot arms (14), and that the anchoring portions (13) of said 

toggle link buckles (11) mounted on the other side of said upper part 
(3) of the boot are formed as pivot arms (15) having the other load 

distribution flap (6) of the respective boot attached thereto. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that a toggle link (24) and a pivot arm (14) provided 

for mounting the respective load distribution flap are mounted for 
pivoting about a common pivot axis (25) on the mounting portion (23) of  

 
said toggle link portion (12) of each toggle link buckle (11) secured to 

the upper part of the boot. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to any of claims 2 
to 4, characterized in that said load distribution flaps (5,6) are 

integrally formed at their sides facing towards said upper part (3) of 
the boot with supporting and/or sealing ribs (22) adjacent said hinges 

(14,15). 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the hinge by means of which at least one of said load 

distribution flaps (5,6) is mounted on the upper part (3) of the boot 
is formed by a pivot arm (26) preferably made of a spring steel strip 

and associated to the respective load distribution flap (5,6), said 
pivot arm (26) extending substantially in the longitudinal direction of 

the boot and having its forward end (27) hinged to the upper part of the 
boot by means of a pin (28), and that the respective load distribution 

flap (5,6) is mounted on its associated pivot arm (26) for displacement 
in the longitudinal direction thereof. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 6, characterized in that 
both said load distribution flaps (5,6) of the boot are each displaceably 

mounted on a pivot arm (26) of the type as indicated. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that said pivot arm (26) or pivot arms, respectively, 

is, or are provided, respectively, at a location spaced from the location 
of its/their hinged connection to the upper part (3) of the boot, 

with a hook (31), a nose or the like adapted to be engaged by a tension 
element (32) of a toggle link buckle (33) mounted on said upper part (3) 

of the boot in correspondence to said hook (31), or nose or the like, 
respectively. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 8, characterized 
in that said toggle link (36) of said toggle link buckle (33) 

has two tension arms (32,37) hinged thereto, whereof one tension arm 
(37) is provided for contracting the upper part (3) of the boot and said 

load distribution flaps (5,6) in cooperation with an anchor portion (35) 
secured to the opposite side of the boot, and the other tension arm (32) 

ios provided for retaining the respective pivot arm (26) down on said 
upper part (3) of the boot in cooperation with said hook (31), or said 

nose or the like, respectively.  
 
A sport shoe , particularly a ski boot, according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the hinge of each load distribution flap (5,6) is 

formed by a pair of ledges (38,39) extending approximately in the longitudinal 
direction of the boot at the location of the instep for hooked 

engagement with one another, whereof one ledge (38) is integrally formed 
with the upper part (3) of the boot, and the other ledge (39) is integrally 

formed with the respective load distribution flap (5,6), said two 
ledges (38,39) being longitudinally displaceable relative to one another. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 10, characterized 
in that the two ledges (38,39) of a pair thereof are held
