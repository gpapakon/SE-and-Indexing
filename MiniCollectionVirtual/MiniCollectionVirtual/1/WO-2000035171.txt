<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for passing information between a local exchange and a user/terminal, the language used for presenting the information being chosen in the terminal and the local exchange, and in order to avoid that messages generated by the terminal and the text generated by the local exchange are presented in different languages the present invention suggests a method to synchronize the language in the terminal and the language of the local exchange, or vice versa, wherein are used predefined codes for each of the languages involved.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD FOR PASSING INFORMATION BETWEEN A LOCAL EXCHANGE AND A USER/TERMINALField of the inventionThe present invention relates to a method for passing information between a local exchange and a user/terminal of the type as stated in the preamble of the enclosed patent claim 1.The present invention is primarily related to cordless (DECT) telecommunication networks, but may also be applicable for other cellular and fixed networks.Teknisk bakqrunnThe problem areaMany modern telephone exchanges and terminals have the possibility to pass information to the users in the form of text messages. The displayed information is either generated locally in the terminal, e.g. to inform the user of an incoming call, menu options etc., or generated by the local exchange e.g. to inform the user of available services, message waiting etc.The language used for presenting the information may be chosen in the terminal and in the local exchange. If different languages are chosen in the terminal and the local exchange, there will be a mismatch in the displayed messages. There is no solution that synchronises the language to be generated locally in the terminal and the language that the local exchange uses . 

Known solutionsOne can choose the language for displaying locally generated messages in many modern terminals. One can also choose the language for displaying text generated by most modern telephone exchanges .There does not, however, exist any system which synchronizes the language in the terminal with the language of the local exchange, or vice versa.Problems with onwn solutionsThe problem with existing solutions is that messages generated by the terminal and the text generated by the local exchange may differ. Typically, the individual user can select the language of messages generated by the terminal, but not the messages generated by the local exchange. In a multi-lingual environment, it may be difficult to pass on information that all users understand.Further prior artThere are also previously known systems comprising complex messaging and recorded voice messaging with translation capabilities.However, in some of these prior art systems it seems unlikely that the language code can be changeable at all .US patent publication 5,524,137 (Rhee) relates to a multi-media messaging system, which system is acting more as a language translator. Consequently, this prior art teaching is silent about how to synchronize a local network and the terminal connected thereto, to use the same language. Further, the prior system is

 P a t e n t c l a i m s
1. Method for passing information between a local exchange and a user/terminal , the language used for presenting the information being chosen in the terminal and the local exchange, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that in order to synchronize the language in the terminal and the language of the local exchange, or vice versa there are used predefined codes for each of the languages involved.
2. Method as claimed in claim 1, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that for the user to select an appropriate language on the user terminal the terminal user will use the built-in option for this selection, and that the language code is transmitted from the terminal to the local exchange during a terminal roaming procedure .
3. Method as claimed in claim 1, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that for the user to select an appropriate language on the user terminal, the terminal user will use the built-in option for this selection, and that the local exchange is informed at the establishment of a call.
4. Method as claimed in claim 3, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that said call is a normal call, or a call set up to inform the local exchange of the desired language.
5. Method as claimed in claim 4, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the language of the user is set at initilization of the users data.
6. Method as claimed in claim 5, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that when the user 


connects a wired terminal, or performs a roaming procedure with a wireless terminal, the terminal is informed of the language to be used for this displaying text .
7. Method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that messages generated in the terminal and messages generated in the local exchange are selected independently.
8. Method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that different information is selected to be presented in different languages .
9. Method as claimed in any of the preceding claims, c a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the same language is selected for all information being displayed.
