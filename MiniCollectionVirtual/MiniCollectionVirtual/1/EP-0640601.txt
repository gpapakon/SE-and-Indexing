<ABSTRACT>
A benzamide derivative represented by general formula (I) and a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R¹ represents 
hydrogen or lower alkanoyl; R² represents hydrogen or halogen; R³ represents lower alkoxy; R⁴ represents hydrogen 

or lower alkyl; R⁵ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy; A represents C₁ to C₇ alkylene which may be substituted 
by lower alkyl; X represents methylene, oxygen or sulfur; m represents an integer of 0 to 3; n represents an integer of 

0 to 3; and p represents an integer of 0 to 2. These compounds are useful because of their activity of enhancing the function 
of a digestive tract, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the same as the active ingredient is useful for treating digestive 

system diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzamide derivatives 
which have excellent gastrointestinal stimulating activity and 
antiemetic activity and are useful as medicament for the treatment 
of gastrointestinal diseases. The present invention further 
relates to a method for preparing said benzamide derivatives and a 
pharmaceutical composition useful for the treatment of 
gastrointestinal diseases comprising said benzamide derivative as an 
active ingredient. Since the development of Metoclopramide (The Merck Index, 11th 
Edition, 6063) as an antiemetic agent and a gastrointestinal 
prokinetic agent, various substituted benzamide derivatives having 
antiemetic activity and gastrointestinal stimulating activity have 
been provided. For example, The Merck Index (11th edition, 2344) discloses 
Clebopride which is a benzamide derivative having a piperidine ring 
and is useful as antiulcer agent. The Merck Index (11th edition, 
2318) discloses Cisapride useful as a gastrointestinal prokinetic 
agent. These drugs are widely used clinically. In addition, 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. (Sho)55-92384 discloses  
 
that benzamide derivatives substituted with an azabicyclo ring have 
antiemetic activity and gastrointestinal stimulating activity and 
that they are useful as an antiemetic agent and a gastrointestinal 
prokinetic agent. Document D1 (EP-A-0 243 959) discloses substituted benzamide derivatives 
such as 4-amino-5-chloro-N-[(4-substituted-2-morpholinyl)methyl]-2-methoxybenzamide, 
pharmaceutical compositions 
containing the same, and processes for the preparation thereof. 
In said compounds, salts and N-oxide derivatives thereof show 
good gastro-intestinal motility enhancing activity. Document D2 (EP-A-0 230 718) describes substituted benzamides 
and benzoates, having pharmacological activity, processes for 
the preparation thereof and their use as pharmaceuticals. Document D3 (EP-A-0 099 194) discloses benzamides which have 
anti-depressant and/or anxiolytic activity, a process for their 
preparation and their use in the treatment of mammals.  
 However, these substituted benzamide derivatives are not 
sufficiently useful since they do not have stimulating activity on 
lower digestive tracts such as the large intestine, although they 
have stimulating activity on upper digestive tracts such as the 
stomach. Furthermore, these substituted benzamide derivatives are 
not satisfactory from a safe standpoint since they sometimes cause 
adverse reactions such as extrapyramidal syndrome or 
hy
