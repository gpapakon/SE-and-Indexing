<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a process of degassing and cooling a hot black water slurry. The hot black water slurry is obtained from syngas scrubbers. The black water slurry is cooled and degassed by exposing the black water slurry to a vacuum under conditions sufficient to separate dissolved gases from the black watter slurry. These gases are then removed from the black water slurry. These gases can advantageously be recycled in the gasification process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the cooling and degassing black water obtained from
scrubbing syngas.Synthetic gas, or syngas, may be produced by reacting solid or liquid carbonaceous fuels
with gases such as air, enriched air, or oxygen, in the optional presence of steam or water in a
gasification reactor. The syngas obtained is withdrawn from the gasification reactor and
subjected to several cleansing operations to rid it of various contaminants which are formed or
liberated from the solid or liquid carbonaceous fuels during the gasification operation. These
contaminants can readily become environmental pollutants if not properly treated during the
gasification operation.For example, materials often found in the syngas include hydrogen sulfide, ammonia,
cyanides, phenols, various halogens and particulates in the form of carbon, ash, and coal, as well
as trace metals. The disposal and control of these pollutants must be satisfactorily handled in
order to make gasification a viable process without suffering attendant pollution problems.As the syngas is discharged from the gasifier, it is usually subjected to multiple cooling
and cleaning operations involving a scrubbing technique wherein the gas is introduced into at
least one scrubber and is contacted with a water spray which cools the gas and condenses such
condensables as tar, oil and organics. The water used for the scrubbing operation becomes what
is commonly known as "black water," since it is contaminated with carbon. This black water
can also contain soluble gases. This black water may be subjected to a variety of steps which
may include the decantation of the carbon-containing solids, the partial concentration of solids in
the slurry, the stripping of such gases as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and also solvent extraction 
steps to remove the carbon and dissolved carbon-containing compounds such phenols and
cyanides.Particulate solids, i.e. carbon, soot, and ash, entrained in the hot raw gas stream from
a partial oxidation gas generator are removed by quench cooling the hot gas stream directly in
water in a quench drum and by scrubbing with water in a gas scrubbing zone. By this means,
a clean gas stream and a dispersion of particulate solids i.e. carbon and ash are produced. It is
economic to reclaim the water in the aforesaid dispersion by removing particulate solids and
gaseous impurities. However, in the reclaiming operation troublesome pumpable aqueous
emulsions form in the system and have to be removed. The reclaimed water may be then
