<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions with useful fungicidal properties. The present invention provides a fungicidal composition comprising 
a) prochloraz and b) cyprodinil. Prochloraz is a known fungicide and is the common name for 1-[N-propyl-N-{2-(2,4,6-trichlorophenoxy)ethyl]carbamoyl}imidazole, 
and that name is used in 
the specification to also include metal complexes of this compound. Cyprodinil is 
a known fungicide, and is the common name for 2-anilino-4-cyclopropyl-6-methylpyrimidine. 
This compound is disclosed in EP 310550. We have found that the compositions of the invention have advantageous 
properties over the individual components and that synergism is often 
demonstrated, and yield of crop may be increased. The ratios of the prochloraz to cyprodinil vary over a wide range but are usually in 
the range 1:5 to 5:1. These ratios are based on the weight of the free base. In addition, other pesticides may be employed in conjunction with the active 
ingredients described above providing they do not adversely affect the interaction 
between the fungicidal components. For example it is sometimes useful to include 
additional fungicides, which extend the range of activity in order to control a 
wider spectrum of fungi. The compositions of the invention are active against a wide range of fungi, e.g. 
powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis) on cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats 
and rye and other foliar diseases such as glume blotch (Septoria nodorum), leaf  
 
blotch (Rhynchosporium secalis) and rusts (e.g. Puccinia graminis). Certain 
compositions of the present invention can be used to control seed-borne 
organisms such as bunt (Tilletia caries) on wheat, loose smut (Ustilago nuda and 
Ustilago hordei) on barley and oats, leaf spot (Pyrenophora avenae) on oats and 
leaf stripe (Pyrenophora graminis) on barley. The compositions can also be applied 
to rice for control of rice blast (Pyricularia oryzae), to horticultural crops such as 
apple trees for the control of apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), roses and other 
ornamentals for the control of powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca pannosa), rust and 
black spot, to many crops, for the control of Botrytis cinerea, to turf for the 
control of dollar spot (Sclerotinia homeocarpa) and to stored produce for the 
control of storage rot organisms of citrus fruit, potatoes, sugar beet, apples, pears 
etc., (e.g. Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp. and Botrytis spp.). Other diseases that 
may be combatted include Helminthosporium spp. and Cercospora spp. The
