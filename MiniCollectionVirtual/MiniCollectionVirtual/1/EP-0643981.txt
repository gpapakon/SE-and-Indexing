<ABSTRACT>
To provide a practical matrix for iontophoresis with markedly 
improved drug availability. A system for iontophoreses, which comprises an 

anode side matrix and a cathode side matrix, wherein the anode side matrix 
contains a cationized drug and the cathode side matrix contains a watrer-soluble 

acidic substance. A matrix for iontophoreses comprising a drug 
reservoir containing a drug, the drug reservoir having a thickness of less than 

0.05 mm. Iontophoresis using the iontophoretic matrix of the present 
invention makes it possible to administer a drug to the body at high 

availability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for iontophoreses.Iontophoresis is a percutaneous absorption promoting system with
electricity as an external stimulant. The principle behind it is that drug
molecule penetration through the skin barrier is promoted as molecules
charged positively in the electric field between the cathode and anode upon
electric supply migrate from the anode to the cathode, while negatively
charged molecules migrate from the cathode to the anode [see the Journal of
Controlled Release, Vol. 18, pp. 213-220, 1992; Advanced Drug Delivery
Review, Vol. 9, p.119, 1992; Pharmaceutical Research, Vol. 3, pp. 318-326,
1986].Recent advances in synthetic technology and gene engineering have
made it possible to produce naturally-occurring peptides or proteins, or
derivatives thereof obtained by altering the amino acid compositions thereof
or chemically modifying them, in pure forms and in large amounts. Such
substances are expected to be applied to pharmaceuticals. On the other hand,
medication of these peptides or proteins, which exhibit various physiological
activity in trace amounts, must be controlled rigorously to maximize their
drug efficacy with minimum prevalence of side effects in particular diseases.
For example, parathyroid hormone and active fragments thereof exhibit
mutually opposite actions on bone, i.e., bone formation and bone destruction.
These are used to treat osteoporosis by intermittent administration in which
bone formation surpasses bone destruction.However, such physiologically active peptides or proteins are generally
known to be poorly absorbable because of decomposition by digestive juices in
the gastrointestinal tract and hydrolysis by lytic enzymes secreted from the
digestive wall. It is therefore common practice to administer these
physiologically active peptides or proteins by injection, rather than oral
administration, to obtain satisfactory efficacy. However, this practice poses
significant pain on the patient, and a major burden associated with the
impossibility of self-administration. This is especially true when intermittent 
multiple-dose administration is required as in the case of active fragments of
parathyroid hormone.In the field of pharmaceutical manufacture, iontophoresis, as a new
drug delivery system potentially applicable to such physiologically active
peptides and proteins, is now being extensively studied.A device for iontophoresis equipped with a means of voltage control for
switching the polarity of the voltage applied between a pair of electrodes
