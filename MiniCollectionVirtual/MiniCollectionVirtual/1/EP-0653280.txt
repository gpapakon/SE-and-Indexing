<ABSTRACT>
A method of the invention can produce a fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin foamed product having less unevenness in a 

thickness of a surface layer and excellent mechanical strength. 
In the method, a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin sheet is 

continuously shaped into a hollow member, and a foaming resin 
composition containing a thermoplastic resin and a foaming agent 

is supplied into an interior of the obtained hollow member. The 
foaming agent is foamed so that the hollow member is shaped into 

a desired form by the foaming pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a
fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin foamed product including a
core layer formed of a thermoplastic resin foamed member, and a
surface layer formed of a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin
sheet.Elongated products having different shapes in a lateral
section and having a foamed layer therein have been used as a
constructing material and the like in the same manner as a
natural wood material, or as a substitute. For such use, in
order to increase the rigidity of the material, a formed product
including a core layer formed of a thermoplastic resin foamed
member and a surface layer formed of a fiber-reinforced
thermosetting plastic resin composite has been used.Japanese Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 4-339635 discloses a
method, wherein in order to continuously produce a composite
having a good mechanical strength with light weight, while
continuously supplying a synthetic resin foamed member in one
direction, continuous fibers permeated with a thermosetting
plastic resin are applied onto an outer surface of the synthetic
resin foamed member, which are heated and drawn out to obtain a
foamed product.However, in the method, it is necessary to prepare,
beforehand, the foamed member with irregular shape in the lateral
cross section. Further, since the foamed product is produced by a 
draw moulding, a resin having a low viscosity is used, so
that the thickness of the surface layer and mechanical
strength of the foamed product tend to be non-uniform.
Also, it is difficult to modify and shape the product in
a mould.In view of the above problems, in producing a fibre-reinforced
thermoplastic resin foamed product comprising
a surface layer of a fibre-reinforced thermoplastic resin
and a core layer of a foamed member, it is an object of
the present invention to provide a method for producing a
fibre-reinforced thermoplastic resin foamed product
having less unevenness in the thickness of the surface
layer and an excellent mechanical strength, such as a
bending strength.It is known from DE-A-1 704 877 to produce a fibre
reinforced resin foamed product by
shaping at least one fibre reinforced resin sheet
continuously to form a hollow member having a first
cross-sectional shape;locating a foamable resin composition containing a
resin and a foaming agent inside the hollow member; andfoaming said foamable resin composition.The invention provides a method of
producing a fibre reinforced resin foamed product,
comprising the steps of:
shaping at least one fibre

A method of producing a fibre reinforced resin
foamed product, comprising the steps of:


shaping at least one fibre reinforced resin sheet
continuously to form a hollow member having a first

cross-sectional shape;
locating a foamable resin composition containing a
resin and a foaming agent inside the hollow member; and
foaming said foamable resin composition;

characterised in that the resin of the sheet, and
the resin of the foamable resin composition, are

thermoplastic, and the hollow member is shaped into a
second cross-sectional shape different from the first

cross-sectional shape by a foaming pressure of the
foamable resin composition.
The method according to claim 1 wherein the foamable
resin composition is supplied to the inside of the hollow

member while the foamable resin composition is foaming.
The method according to claim 1 wherein after the
foamable resin composition is supplied to the inside of

the hollow member, the foamable resin composition is
heated to a temperature more than a foaming temperature

to thereby initiate foaming of the foamable resin
composition.
The method according to any preceding claim wherein
the hollow member passes through a mould. 
The method according to claim 4 wherein at least
part of said foaming occurs while the hollow member

passes through the mould, the hollow member being shaped

foamable resin composition is supplied to the hollow

member while the hollow member is in the mould.
The method according to claim 1, wherein the
foamable resin composition is in the form of a foamable

layer, said shaping and locating being combined such that
the foamable layer is disposed on said fibre reinforced

resin sheet, thereby forming a composite sheet; and said
