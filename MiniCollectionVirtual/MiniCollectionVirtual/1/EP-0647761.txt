<ABSTRACT>
Roller shutter system with lateral support parts (1) for a draw-out mechanism (3), a bearing (2) or the like, with lateral guide rails (5) for the roller shutter, it being possible for the guide rails (5) to be connected to a lateral support part (1) in each case. A connecting element (7) which is separate from the guide rails (5) and the support parts (1) serves to connect guide rail (5) and support part (1).

A roller blind system with lateral carrier members (1) for a draw-up
mechanism, a mounting or the like, with lateral guide rails (5) for the

roller blind shuttering, wherein the guide rails (5) can each be connected
to a respective lateral carrier member (1) by way of a respective

connecting element (7) which is separate from the guide rails (5) and the
carrier members (1), characterised in that the relative lateral position

as between the guide rail (5) and the carrier member (1) is adjustable by
way of the separate connecting element (7), wherein the separate

connecting element (7) includes two L-shaped parts, wherein two L-limbs
(7a, 7b) of said parts partially overlap and by way of a releasable

connection are selectively adjustable relative to each other with
different degrees of overlap.
A roller blind system with lateral carrier members (1) for a draw-up
mechanism, a mounting or the like, with lateral guide rails (5) for the

roller blind shuttering, wherein the guide rails (5) can each be connected
to a respective lateral carrier member (1) by way of a respective

connecting element (7) which is separate from the guide rails (5) and the
carrier members (1), characterised in that the relative lateral position

as between the guide rail (5) and the carrier member (1) is adjustable by
way of the separate connecting element (7), wherein the roller blind

system includes a plurality of different separate connecting elements (7)
which are at least partially of a Z-shaped profile and of which a

respective one, depending on the respectively desired relative lateral
position of the guide rail (5) and the carrier member (1), can be selected

for connecting the guide rail (5) and the carrier member (1) and can be
connected to the carrier member (1) and to the guide rail (5) by way of

push-in connections.
A roller blind system according to claim 2 characterised in that
for the releasable connection the carrier member (1) and/or the guide rail

(5) each have at least one respective mounting means (18, 10; 5c) into
which the separate connecting element (7) can be fitted. 
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that in the condition of being connected to the lateral

carrier member (1) the connecting element (7) extends over the large part
of the height of the lateral carrier member (1).
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 4
characterised in that the separate connecting element (7) comprises a flat

or profiled metal portion or plastics portion.
A roller blind system according to one of claims 2 to 5
characterised in that the separate connecting element (7) is of a one-part

configuration.
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 6
characterised in that it includes a plurality of different left-hand and

right-hand guide rails (5) whose connecting region (5c) to the connecting
element or elements (7) is of the same configuration.
A roller blind system according to claim 7 characterised in that

the guide rails (5) are respectively subdivided over their entire length
into at least two parts (5a, 5b), wherein a connecting region (5b) for the

connecting element or elements (7) is provided in a first part (5a) and at
least one further part (5b) for guiding the roller blind, a fly screen or

the like is fixed to said first part (5a).
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 8
characterised in that the roller blind system includes for each carrier

member (1) at least one cover means (9) which can be fixed at the end on
the outside to the respective carrier member (1).
A roller blind system according to claim 9 characterised in that
for each of the carrier members (1) it includes two or more different

cover plates (9) which can be selectively fixed to the respective carrier
member. 
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 10
characterised in that it includes two or more different carrier members

(1) which can be selectively fixed to the guide rails (5) by way of
connecting elements (7).
A roller blind system according to claim 11 characterised in that
the carrier members (1) have a similar connecting element or a similar

mounting means (1b, 10) for a separate connecting element (7) for
connecting the carrier member (1) to the respective guide rail (5).
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 12
characterised in that the carrier members (1) are of a one-part

configuration and preferably comprise stamped sheet metal.
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 13
characterised in that the carrier members (1) have angled legs (1a) at the

edge.
A roller blind system according to one of claims 1 to 14
characterised in that the carrier members (1) have a profiled structure

and preferably have at least one profile channel (1b).
A roller blind system according to claim 15 characterised in that
a profile channel (1b) is provided for accommodating a separate connecting

element (7), by way of which the guide rail (5) can be connected to the
respective carrier member (1).
