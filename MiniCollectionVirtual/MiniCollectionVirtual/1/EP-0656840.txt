<ABSTRACT>
A wheel traction control system establishes a velocity reference as a function of the wheel speeds of the non-driven wheels (36a, 36d) of the vehicle. When the wheel speed of either of the driven wheels (36b, 36c) exceeds the velocity reference, braking pressure is applied to the faster rotating wheel. The braking pressure is calculated as a function of the error or difference between the speed of the spinning wheel (36b or 36c) and the velocity reference, and as a function of wheel acceleration and the previously calculated braking pressure. Accordingly, smooth control of the spinning wheel (36b or 36c) is effected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a traction control 
method for a vehicle. Undesirable wheel slippage may result when a 
vehicle is accelerated. Such slippage may occur when the 
drive wheel on one side of the vehicle rests on a surface 
with a low coefficient of friction and the drive wheel on 
the other side rests on a surface has a higher coefficient 
of friction, or when both drive wheels rest one surface have 
a uniformly low coefficient of friction. In either case, 
the drive wheel begins spinning while the other drive wheel 
remains stationary. In such cases, the vehicle may be 
immobilized because all power is transferred to the spinning 
wheel, while the opposite wheel is immobilized because the 
vehicle differential transfers all power to the spinning 
wheel. Traction control systems have been proposed to 
mitigate this problem. Such traction control systems 
usually include a brake control system, in which braking 
pressure is applied to the brake controlling the spinning 
wheel, so that some power is applied to the other wheel. In 
prior art systems, a constant braking pressure is applied to 
the spinning wheel, or braking pressure is ramped up and 
down at predetermined rates such as disclosed in US-A-4,823,269 
wherein fluid pressure supplied to the driven 
wheel is proportional to the sum of the spin acceleration 
and the spin amounts between the driven wheels as compared 
to a threshold value for such fluid pressure. Thus US-A-4,823,269 discloses a traction control 
method for a vehicle having a pair of driven wheels and a 
pair of non-driven wheels, each of said driven wheels being 
controlled by brakes actuated by fluid pressure, comprising 
the steps of measuring the wheel speeds of both the driven 
and non-driven wheels, calculating a reference velocity as a 
function of the wheel speed of at least one of the non-driven  
 
wheels, comparing the wheel speeds of the driven 
wheels with the reference velocity during a set time period, 
activating traction control of the one driven wheel with the 
higher wheel speed if said higher wheel speed is also 
greater than the reference velocity, establishing a desired 
pressure level for the brake controlling said one driven 
wheel, and communicating a current fluid pressure level 
equal to said desired pressure level to the brake 
controlling said one driven wheel, said desired pressure 
level being established as a function of the magnitude of 
any difference between the actual wheel speed of said one 
driven wheel and the reference velocity upon

Traction control method for a vehicle having a 
pair of driven wheels (36b,36c) and a pair of non-driven 

wheels (36a,36d), each of said driven wheels (36b,36c) being 
controlled by brakes actuated by fluid pressure, comprising 

the steps of measuring the wheel speeds of both the driven 
(36b,36c) and non-driven wheels (36a,36d), calculating a 

reference velocity as a function of the wheel speed of at 
least one of the non-driven wheels (36a,36d), comparing the 

wheel speeds of the driven wheels (36b,36c) with the 
reference velocity during a set time period, activating 

traction control of the one driven wheel (36b or 36c) with 
the higher wheel speed if said higher wheel speed is also 

greater than the reference velocity, establishing a desired 
pressure level for the brake controlling said one driven 

wheel (36b or 36c), and communicating a current fluid 
pressure level equal to said desired pressure level to the 

brake controlling said one driven wheel (36b or 36c), said 
desired pressure level being established as a function of 

the magnitude of any difference between the actual wheel 
speed of said one driven wheel (36b or 36c) and the 

reference velocity upon activating traction control of said 
one driven wheel (36b or 36c) taking into consideration the 

wheel acceleration of said one driven wheel (36b or 36c) to 
establish said current pressure level, which is selectively 

supplied to said driven wheel (36b,36c) during each time 
period characterised in that said current pressure level is 

modified from a previous pressure level to an immediate 
current pressure level by a magnitude corresponding to the 

difference between any increases and decreases between the 
actual wheel speed of said one driven wheel and the 

reference velocity, and inhibited from operating said wheel 
brake during activation of traction control in said one 

driven wheel (36b or 36c) if the current pressure level in 
the brake controlling either of said driven  

 
wheels (36b,36c) is above said predetermined pressure 

level.
