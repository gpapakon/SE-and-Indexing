<ABSTRACT>
A foldable container comprising a floor (11), a roof (10), and at least two sidewalls (12-15). Each one of the side walls (12-15) is connected with the floor (11) through link members (27) forming a connection between the edge side (20) of the floor and the lower edge side of respective side wall (12-15). The link members allow on one hand turning the wall between a horizontal position and a vertical position, and on the other hand displacing the wall in its own plane.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foldable container, comprising a floor, a roof 
and at least two side-walls, wherein a frame extends along the edge sides of the 
floor. Foldable containers of the above described type can be used as transportation 
containers for various kinds of goods, as weather shelters, as storage buildings on 
building sites, or as quickly erectable habitable accommodations on catastrophe 
sites. EP-A-0 048 577 describes an example of a foldable container of this type. 
Several more attempts have also been made to achieve such advantageous 
devices. Usually these known constructions comprise a number of loose parts such as wall 
sections, fastening members and the like which are required for assembling the 
container by means of a number of tools. As an alternative the various wall 
elements in a container may be pivotedly connected with each other through 
hinges. A drawback with these hinges is that they often form bridges for heat 
transfer through the wall construction. Moreover these hinges are easily damaged 
during transportation and erection. It is therefore a first object of the invention to provide a foldable container which 
is useful for the above described tasks, which container does not have any loose 
parts or need any fastening members for the erection and which does not have 
hinges which are easily damaged or other heat transferring bridges. For this purpose the invention is characterized in that each one of the side-walls 
is connected to the floor through said frame and link members, which form a 
connection between the frame and the bottom edge of respective side-walls, that 
one end of each link member is vertically displaceable in the frame, which allows on one  
 
hand turning the wall between a horizontal position and a vertical position, and 
on the other hand displacing the wall in its own plane, and that the floor frame 
forms a side support to the side-walls, when said side-walls are erected to vertical 
positions. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the appending subclaims. An embodiment of the invention now will be described more in detail with 
reference to the appending drawings, in which 
Fig. 1shows in a perspective view a container according to the invention in 
its collapsed transportation state; Fig. 2shows the container in a corresponding view during erection; Fig. 3shows the container after finished erection; Fig. 4is a section through the container along the line IV-IV in Fig. 1; Fig. 5is a partial sectional view

<CLAIMS>
A foldable container comprising a floor (11), a roof (10) and at least two side-walls 
(12-15), wherein a frame (20) extends along the edge sides of the floor 

(11),
characterized
 in that each one of the side-walls (12-15) is connected to 
the floor (11) through said frame and link members (27), which form a 

connection between the frame (20) and the bottom edge of respective side-walls 
(12-15), that one end (32) of each link member (27) is vertically displaceable in the frame, 

which allows on one hand turning the wall between a horizontal position and a 
vertical position, and on the other hand displacing the wall in its own plane, and 

that the floor frame (20) forms a side support to the side-walls (12-15), when said 
side-walls are erected to vertical positions. 
A foldable container according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that one 
end (32) of each link member (27) is displaceable in a rail (25), and that the rails 

(25) are placed in a frame (20) extending along the edge sides of the floor (11). 
A foldable container according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that 
the floor frame (20) is provided to cooperate during transportation with a frame 

(19) running along the edge sides of the roof (10), said two frames together with 
the floor (11) and the roof (10) encasing a space accomodating the container 

walls (12-15). 
A foldable container according to any of claims 1-3, 
characterized
 in 
that the floor (11), the roof (10) and side-walls (12-15) are provided with interior 

insulation, and that the floor and the roof have recesses (37 and 38, respectively) 
for the lower and upper edges, respectively of the walls, so that the side-walls 

(12-15) in their erected positions overlap the roof and the floor.
