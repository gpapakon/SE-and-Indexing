<ABSTRACT>
Use of an  alpha -tocopheryl phosphate, in particular in the dl or d form thereof, or one of the esters thereof, of general formula: 
<

<CLAIMS>
Use of an α-tocopherol phosphate, especially in its dl or d form,
or an ester thereof, of the general formula



in which:

R
1
 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
such as the methyl or ethyl radical in particular, or an α-tocopheryl radical;
R
2
 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
such as a methyl or ethyl radical in particular, or else R
2
O is an
oxyethylenated chain of the formula



in which R
3
 and R
4
 independently are a hydrogen
atom or a methyl radical and n is an integer greater than or equal to 1;

or a salt thereof,

for preparing a pharmaceutical, dermatological or cosmetic composition
intended for the prevention or treatment of the harmful effects of the free

radicals,

or as antifree radical cosmetic agent.
Use according to claim 1 of a compound of formula (I) as defined
above, preferably as a salt, in the form of small liposome-type vesicles

obtained by dispersing said compound or said salt in water or in an
aqueous medium such as a buffer solution.
Use according to claim 2, characterized in that the size of the
vesicles is between about 6.10
-2
 µm and 2 µm.
Use according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterized in that the
above-mentioned aqueous medium contains a biologically active agent,

said agent being at least partially encapsulated after dispersion in the
above-mentioned vesicles. 
Use according to claim 4, characterized in that the biologically
active agent is an antiallergic substance such as an extract of Scutellaria,

for example an extract of the root of Scutellaria Baicalensis Georgi, or an
antiinflammatory substance.
Use according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
concentration by weight of the compound of formula (I) mentioned above,

or a salt thereof, is between 0.001 and 10%, preferably between 0.01%
and 1% and particularly preferably between 0.05% and 0.5%, relative to

the total weight of the composition.
Use according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
compound of formula (I) mentioned above is dl-α-tocopherol phosphate.
Use according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the
salt of the compound of formula (I) mentioned above is a monosodium salt

or the disodium salt.
Cosmetic method for preventing or for treating the harmful
effects of the free radicals, characterized in that it comprises applying an

effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I) or a salt thereof,
as defined in any one of claims 1 to 8, incorporated in a cosmetically

acceptable excipient, vehicle or carrier.
