<ABSTRACT>
The principle of differential angular deviation due 
to the difference in horizontal distance between the two eyes 

of a human being is utilized in a simulated stereoscopic 
television production system in which an image which is 

produced on a plane surface by a monoscope is subjected to 
double angle refraction by lenses to form an image similar at 

both its left and right sides with each angle corresponding 
to each of the two eyes to produce a simulated stereoscopic 

effect. In a preferred embodiment, the image which is 
projected by the picture tube 11 is magnified by a lens unit 

2 and applied to a tunnel unit 3 formed by two circular arc 
stripe mirrors and a horizontal stripe mirror to form a sense 

of depth of the image. The horizontal stripe mirror serves 
the function of stabilizing the image within the tunnel unit 

3 for viewing purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
Generally speaking, the method of making stereo 
image is to make use of the principle of angular deviation 
produced from the difference in horizontal distance between 
the two eyes of human beings, where more than two cameras are 
employed for taking double-angle photographs, which will be 
projected to correspond with the two eyes of the viewers. 
Analysis will have to be made through the process of special 
lens (such as stereo opticals) to produce stereoscopic effect. However, three defects are found in this 
conventional method. Firstly, the expenses for photograph 
taking is expensive. The cost for the camera and the material 
is two times higher than that of single camera operation, 
accounted for a comparatively higher expenses in proportion 
to its production cost. Secondly, a special pair of opticals 
will have to be put on while viewing the picture. Speaking 
in terms of the viewers, this greatly reduced its convenience, 
and consequently its circulation and availability to all. 
Thirdly, now it still takes time to put it into practice as 
modification is  
 
required for its photographic transmission system. In view of the above defects, the inventor made up 
his mind to overcome the defects by contributing his 
time and energy in his renovation. Through repeated 
studies and experiments he managed to make the present 
invention, which, besides magnifying the image several 
times at a comparatively lower cost, will also enable 
the image to produce an in-depth and stereoscopic 
effect at a more economical and convenient mode without 
making any changes to the existing system.  It is an object of the present invention to produce 
an 'imitated stereoscopic' effect as though the picture 
were watched by one eye by means of an analyzing process 
made to the horizontal stripes. It is another object of the present invention is to 
control at will the availability or unavailability of 
the forementioned by means of the position moving of 
either separation or piling of the straight-stripe combination 
lens. It is a further object of the present invention to 
enable easy availability of picture with imitated 
stereoscopic image by means of the features of the 
structure of the present invention, as well as merely 
utilizing a monocular camera to produce pictures with 
'imitated sterescopic' effect as though produced by 
horizontal-stripe analytical lens without using two or 
three cameras for shooting, and thus resulted in cutting 
down a lot of cost. It is still another object of the present
