<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a composition of matter 
which has been demonstrated to be a very effective 

treatment for acne, seborrheic dermatitis and related skin 
diseases when applied to and contacted with affected skin 

areas, while avoiding the disadvantages and complications 
attendant to more established treatments. The composition 

comprises a synthetic mixture of salts which, when 
dissolved in a solvent such as water, is ionically composed 

primarily of a mixture of sodium and magnesium cations and 
chloride and sulfate anions, and which is preferably free 

of added Zinc. More specifically, the salt mixture 
according to the present invention comprises the following 

range of composition in grams/kilogram of salt mixture in 
the ionic state, the balance being water of hydration: 


I. 

CATIONS (g/kg salt mixture) 
ANIONS (g/kg salt mixture) 
Sodium
150 to 380
Chloride
150 to 750 
Magnesium
10 to 90
Sulfate
20 to 200 
Calcium
1 to 30
Hydrogen Carbonate
1 to 5 
Potassium
0.5 to 35
Carbonate
0.1 to 2 
The composition may be applied to the affected areas of the 
skin as a solution, i.e., as a bath, moist swab or spray, 

or more preferably in combination with a suitable carrier 
such as to form a gel, salve, shampoo or a liquid or solid 

soap. The composition may also be used in combination with 
known therapeutic agents for treatment of skin diseases, 

and vanishes very quickly from the skin due to a high 
absorption by the skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a topical skin preparation for the
treatment of acne, seborrheic dermatitis and other skin
diseases.Acne is a well known and common skin disease. It has very
different forms as well as grades of severity, from the so-called
"pubertary pimples" i.e., a simple acne vulgaris,
extending to the more dangerous forms such as acne
conglobate, which can lead to severe disfigurements of the
skin. It is estimated that about one quarter of all young
people in the industrialized countries suffer from acne
with a culmination age at 15-18 years. The disease acne
seems to be generally on the increase. According to a
Swiss study, the percentage of acne patients at the
University Hospital of Basle increased by ten times from
1920 to 1980. While the maximum age formerly was 25 years,
acne patients 50 years of age are as common today. Women
of advanced age are clearly affected stronger than men. It
can be assumed that the reason is the increasing stress of
the skin by environmental influences and improper
cosmetics.As acne generally is not life endangering and is
regarded by some as a kind of pubertary consequence, only
a small part of the people with acne have regular medical
treatment. Yet a significant percentage of the population
is plagued by this disease. Both disregarding it, as well
as excessive and improper treatment, can lead to
irreversible scars and changes of the skin, and consequent 
adverse effects to quality of life.To a large extent, the aforementioned is also true for
seborrheic dermatitis and other skin diseases in their
different forms such as herpes, from simple irritations of
the skin up to severe and irreversible changes of
epidermis. For distinguishing of these diseases and in
order to define their grade, dermatology uses defined terms
which can be measured or counted to a high degree. Acne in
its different forms such as acne aestivalis, fulminans,
necroticans, cosmetica etc. is mostly defined by papules,
pustules, blackheads and whiteheads, while seborrheic
dermatitis and related skin diseases are generally
characterized by itching, scales and erythema.There are basically two possibilities for the therapy of
acne, seborrheic dermatitis and other related skin
diseases: Topical (exterior) treatment and oral treatment
which is effective via the metabolism. The oral treatment
is principally used only for very severe forms of acne,
since retinoids and related active agents may have very
strong side effects. In addition, women are endangered
during their pregnancy. But even the
