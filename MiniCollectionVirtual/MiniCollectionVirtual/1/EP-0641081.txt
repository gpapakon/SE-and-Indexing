<ABSTRACT>
In a digital filter for a digital phase-locked loop in which incident error signals undergo at least one multiplication by a filtering coefficient (K1, K2) before being digitally processed at each clock time in order to supply a filtered signal ( theta f), there is provision to modify the value of the filtering coefficients (K) in increments at each clock time during an initial period of operation of the filter.

<CLAIMS>
A phase-locked loop comprising a digital
filter receiving error signals in which the incoming

error signals are subject to at least one multiplication
by a filtering coefficient (K) before being digitally

processed at each clock pulse to provide a filtered
signal, characterized in that it includes means for

linearly decrementing the value of said at least one
filtering coefficient (K) at each clock pulse during an

initial operation period of the filter.
The phase-locked loop of claim 1,
characterized in that said filter is of the proportionalintegral

type.
The phase-locked loop of claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the initial and end values of said

at least one coefficient (K) are selected so that the
filter has predetermined initial and final bandwidths.
Modem incorporating the phase-locked loop
of any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the

frequency to be filtered is the carrier frequency, the
sampling frequency being the baud frequency.
The phase-locked loop of claim 1,
characterized in that said means for linearly

decrementing said at least one coefficient (K) include:

a register (20) containing the current value
(Ki) of the coefficient;
means for initially loading an initial value
(KMAX) in said register;
means (21) for subtracting an incrementation
value (KDEC), at each clock time, from the content of the

filter; 
means (22) for comparing the current value of
the filter with an end value (KMIN); and
means for interrupting the operation of the
decrementation system when the current value (Ki) of the

coefficient has reached the minimum value (KMIN).
