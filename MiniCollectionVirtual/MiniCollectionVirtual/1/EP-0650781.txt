<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a drive for the multi-axis transport of workpieces through successive stages in a forming press, in which a lifting mechanism (4) drives the lifting columns (9) vertically by means of a linkage (42) of lever pairs, the said lifting columns being connected to the feedbars (2, 3). An additional opening and closing mechanism brings about transverse displacement of the bearing housings (46) of the respective lifting columns (9).

<CLAIMS>
Drive arrangement for multiaxial transport of work pieces
through consecutive processing stations of a forming press,

and in particular a transfer press, wherein two gripper
rails arranged parallel to one another are provided, which

are movable in vertical direction by means of a hoisting
mechanism and also in transverse direction by means of an

opening and closing mechanism, whereby to perform the
vertical hoisting movement (45) below the gripper rails (2,

3) a cross beam (11) which may be moved up and down by
means of a drivable lever linkage (42) is provided, the

cross beam (11) has guide means (13) for hoisting pillars
(9) displaceable thereon, by means of which a respective

gripper rail (2, 3) is disposed to be transversely
displaceable, whereby to perform a transversely directed

opening and closing movement of the gripper rails (2, 3), a
joint drive arrangement (49, 61) is allocated to the

opposing hoisting pillars (9) for the gripper rails (2, 3),

characterised in that the cross beam (11) connected to the
hoisting pillars (9) is constructed as a U-profile open to

the bottom, which extends as far as possible over the
entire width of the closing box of the press, and its upper

surface section (14) has the guide means (13) for a guide
cradle (12) on the hoisting pillars (9).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that
each hoisting pillar (9) is arranged in a bearing housing

(46), and that the bearing housing has fastening means (52,
69) for transverse transport by means of a linear drive

arrangement (49, 61).
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the linear drive arrangement for the hoisting pillars

(9) or their bearing housing (46) is formed by a threaded
spindle (49) preferably passing through the hoisting 

pillars (9), said spindle being in engagement with a
corresponding spindle nut (52) on the bearing housing (46).
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the linear drive arrangement for the transverse

displacement of the hoisting pillars (9) is formed by a
rotating belt drive (61) or similar, whereby the hoisting

pillars (9) or their bearing housing are fastened on
respective opposing belt strands.
Arrangement according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
bearing housing (46) comprises a cradle (70) with guide

rollers (71), which are supported on corresponding
stationary guide rods (72).
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the bearing housings (46) are

supported on both sides on stops (57, 58) for path
restriction.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the cross beam (11) connected to the

hoisting pillars (9) with its U-profile open to the bottom
has lateral legs (15, 15'), to which a lever linkage (42)

engages for the hoisting movement of the gripper rails (2,
3).
Arrangement according to Claim 7, characterised in that the
U-profile of the cross beam (11) is embedded in a likewise

U-shaped housing (18) opening to the top, and may be moved
in this via angle levers (19, 20) supported in the housing

(18) and bearing webs (16, 17).
Arrangement according to Claim 8, characterised in that to 
perform the vertical movement of the cross beam (11), the

angle levers (19, 20) may be moved or pivoted via a
drivable, and in particular horizontally displaceable

connecting rod (26).
Arrangement according to Claim 9, characterised in that the
drive for the connecting rod (26) is achieved via an

electric motor, servo motor (35) or positioning motor or
similar with threaded spindle (34) and spindle nut (33) or

a similarly acting hydraulic motor or linear drive.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the transverse displacement of the

hoisting pillars (9) connected to the gripper rails (2, 3)
occurs to perform the opening and closing movement required

in the operating cycle, on the one hand, and to adjust the
set-up axis upon change of work piece size, on the other

hand.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the hoisting mechanism (4) and/or the

opening and closing mechanism (5) respectively have a
separate, preferably electric drive.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the drive for the hoisting mechanism

(4) and/or for the opening or closing mechanism (5) and/or
forward thrust mechanism for the gripper rails (2, 3) is

achieved via a joint mechanical drive.
Arrangement according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that respective path measurement systems

(74; 73, 73') are allocated to the hoisting mechanism (4)
and/or the opening or closing mechanism (5, 5').
