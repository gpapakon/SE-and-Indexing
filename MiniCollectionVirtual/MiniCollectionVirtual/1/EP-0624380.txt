<ABSTRACT>
A flexible plastic material catheter having a 
distal tubular member portion with a greater than 75 weight 

percent loading of a radiopaque agent for radiographic 
viewing. The catheter comprises an elongated member having 

a proximal portion and a distal end portion with a 
flexible, radiopaque plastic material having a durometer 

lower than that of the proximal portion. The plastic 
material of the distal end portion comprises a homogeneous 

and evenly dispersed composition of a 20 weight percent 
base thermoplastic, elastomer material such as a polyether 

block amide and 80 weight percent loading of a radiopaque 
agent such as tungsten. This distal end portion plastic 

material exhibits a durometer of approximately 47 on the 
Shore D scale, whereas the polyether block amide material 

exhibits a durometer of approximately 40 on the Shore D 
scale. The flex modulus of the polyether block amide 

material is in range of 23,000 to 75,000 pounds per 
square inch. The proximal end portion comprises a base 

thermoplastic material such as a polyamide elastomer 
material and a radiopaque agent of bismuth oxychloride.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiopaque
catheters.Radiopaque catheters are used to provide
visualization of the catheter during a therapeutic
procedure such as PTCA or kidney stone removal. They
are also used in diagnostic imaging procedures
for injecting contrast medium into the body of a patient.
Several commercially available radiopaque catheters include
increased radiopacity about the distal catheter end.
Visualization of the end is critical for
locating the catheter end with respect to anatomical
structures and preventing inadvertent trauma or injury of
a vessel or duct during advancement of the catheter.One approach to providing a curved, radiopaque
catheter is to form the catheter body from a compound of a
polyurethane material with either 20 weight percent of
barium sulfate or 33.5 weight percent of bismuth
subcarbonate. The distal catheter tip is formed from a
compound of a polyurethane material with 49.83 weight 
percent of bismuth trioxide. As a result, the curved
catheter body is slightly radiopaque, and the distal
catheter tip is more radiopaque than the curved body.A problem with this catheter is that the compound
material forming the distal catheter tip is only moderately
radiopaque in comparison to highly radiopaque materials
such as solid platinum, gold, or tungsten. As a result,
the radiopacity of the distal catheter tip indicates the
general position thereof. However, the position of the
curve in the catheter body cannot be readily discerned.
Furthermore, the point at which the curved catheter body
ends and the distal catheter tip begins has no readily
imageable boundary. Another problem with this curved
catheter is that visualization of the slightly or
moderately radiopaque catheter materials is deemphasized or
overcome by the images of surrounding tissues. The problem
is compounded when injecting contrast medium into a blood
vessel or another duct of a patient's body via the curved
catheter. The contrast medium flows into the vessel or
duct and surrounds the curve and the distal tip of the
catheter. As a result, the curve and the distal tip of the
catheter are difficult to discern or are completely
obstructed by the bright image of the contrast medium.Yet another problem with this curved catheter is
that safely steering and maneuvering the catheter through
tortuous vessels or ducts requires precise visualization of
the distal catheter tip. When the precise position of the
curve or the distal tip of the catheter is not visible, the
catheter can be inadvertently advanced into anatomical
s
