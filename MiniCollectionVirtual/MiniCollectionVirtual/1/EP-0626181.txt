<ABSTRACT>
In a method for continuous, electrical monitoring of 
electrodes of electrical heart stimulators, comprising at least 

one stimulation electrode (28) and an indifferent electrode 
(34), the inter-electrode voltage is kept constant by 

regulation of a compensating current, and the magnitude of this 
current is measured and monitored. A device for such electrode 

monitoring comprises control electronics (24) and an output 
stage (26) for delivery to the stimulation electrode of 

stimulation pulses. The output stage is devised to supply the 
electrodes with a weak, continuous current, or repeated, pulsed 

current, producing a net direct current, in addition to 
stimulation pulses. A monitoring unit (32) is devised to sense 

the inter-electrode voltage and, on the basis thereof, deliver 
an output signal to the control electronics for the purpose of 

controlling said weak current so the inter-electrode voltage 
is kept constant at a given value, monitoring means monitoring 

said output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and device for
continuous, electrical monitoring of electrodes of electrical
heart stimulators, comprising at least one stimulation
electrode, one indifferent electrode, control electronics and
an output stage for delivery of stimulation pulses to the
stimulation electrode.Damages to and other faults in the electrode system of
electrical heart stimulators can develop, making reliable heart
stimulation impossible. In checks on implants at clinics and
hospitals, also the electrode is checked non-invasively. Also
the magnitude of electrode impedance, i.e. stimulation
impedance, and the conformation of pulses from surface ECG
electrodes can supply information on any electrode defects in
the heart stimulator.However, previously known methods are uncertain and
subjective and only reliable when "major" defects, such as
electrode fracture, are present. The circumstance that the
check can only be made when the patient visits a clinic or
hospital is also unsatisfactory.In EP-0 437 104 is described a method and a device for
measuring electrode resistance with sub-threshold pulses to
defibrillation electrodes before a defibrillation shock is
delivered. Here, only one current pulse with a pre-determined
magnitude is emitted across the electrodes and the resulting
voltage is measured and the resistance calculated.In US-4,140,131 is described an implantable heart stimulator
with two impedance detectors, i.e. a low impedance level
detector and a high impedance level detector, to supply a
warning if the stimulator's output impedance is outside a pre-determined
impedance range. Here, the detectors compare the
voltage measured across a serial resistor in the electrode
circuit at the delivery of stimulation pulses with pre-set
limit values. Thus, the need for electrode monitoring at implantable heart
stimulators is well-known and has hitherto been accomplished
in different ways, such as direct measurement on the electrode,
with no stimulator connected, or by delivery of stimulation
pulses, the impedance of pulses being calculated with some
appropriate measurement method. The measurement value is then
transmitted by telemetry, and the doctor decides whether the
impedance value designates a fault-free electrode system or
not.The object of the present invention is to propose a new
method and provide a new device for continuous electrical
electrode monitoring at implantable electrical heart
stimulators with the aid of a continuous current or repeated,
pulsed current, providing a net direct
