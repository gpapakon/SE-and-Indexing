<ABSTRACT>
A filter assembly (10) employs a base (12) which 
mounts a disposable filter element cartridge (14). The 

cartridge (14) includes either a single stage or a dual 
stage filter system. The base (12) has custom and 

generic (20) structural members. Variations in base design 
are accommodated in the custom member , the generic 

member (20) having a generic design. The custom member 
is molded from polymeric material and requires no 

additional machining or treatment prior to use. This 
eliminates filter model specific shop fixtures and jigs, 

reducing costs and providing greater flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices for 
filtering and separating liquids. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to filters for removing foreign 
particles and separating water from fuel of the fuel supply 
system or lubricating oil of an internal combustion engine. The absence of high standards of quality control in 
diesel fuel supplies dictates that an effective fuel filter 
be incorporated into the fuel supply system of a diesel 
engine. It is not uncommon for diesel fuel to have 
significant quantities of abrasive particles and water. 
The abrasive particles present the potential for permanent 
damage to components of the fuel injection pump. The 
abrasive particles can also adversely affect the 
performance of the pump by destroying the ability of the 
fuel injection pump to precisely meter and deliver fuel at 
high pressures. The presence of water in the diesel fuel 
supply can cause corrosion of engine components, and during 
freezing conditions, can result in interruption of the fuel 
injection system and/or seizure of moving components. 
Similarly, water and particulate matter in the lubricating 
oil must be removed to minimize wear of engine parts. Commonly, filters employ a disposable filter cartridge 
which is replaced at pre-established intervals of filter 
usage. The cartridge is secured to a base assembly that is 
fixedly mounted to the engine header or some other fixed 
location. Variations between mounting locations and space 
constraints between different model engines and different 
manufacturers require a wide variety of filter designs. Current filter assemblies to which the invention 
relates employ a base assembly principally composed of a 
metal casting. Such castings must be machined and treated 
before they are suitable for use. Machining and treatment 
machining and fixtures suitable for one filter design are 
commonly unsuitable or have limited use in other filter 
designs. Consequently, tooling costs are a significant 
component in the cost of the finished product.  
 
Additionally, production lines must change from one set of 
tooling to another when the line shifts production from one 
model to another. This process is time consuming, adding 
to production costs and limiting production flexibility. Briefly stated, the invention in a preferred form is 
a filter assembly wherein the base assembly comprises 
custom and generic structural members. Variations in 
filter base design are accommodated in the upper custom 
member, the lower generic member has a
