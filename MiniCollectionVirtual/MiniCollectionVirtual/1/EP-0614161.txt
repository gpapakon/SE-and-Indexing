<ABSTRACT>
A reel for a gaming or amusement machine has a 
support structure for supporting the reel strip (2, 21) 

of a significantly lower moment of inertia than a 
standard reel drum. This is achieved by making the 

reel strip (2, 21) of stiff material and supporting it 
only at spaced-apart points in a single radial plane, 

and relying on the strip to support itself between the 
supported points. The reel support for the strip is in 

the form of one spider, having a plurality of radial 
spokes (42). For further support for the strip a ring 

member (42; 69) may be provided connecting the ends of 
the spokes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gaming and amusement 
machines and in particular to those commonly known as 
fruit machines. In such machines a number of reels, 
usually three or four, carrying symbols on their 
peripheries are spun and then stopped at random. If 
they come to a halt with any one of a number of 
selected combinations of symbols on a so-called 'win 
line', an award is made or other equivalent benefit is 
obtained. Such a machine will hereinafter be referred 
to as of the kind set forth. Traditionally these reels have been mechanical, 
rotating side by side on a common axis and with the 
symbols carried on their peripheral cylindrical 
surfaces. This is almost universal although in 
certain countries, e.g. Germany, the reels are 
sometimes in the form of flat discs with the symbols 
arranged in a ring on one face. Even an arrangement 
involving each reel being in the form of a frustum of a 
cone, with the peripheries lying in a common conical 
surface, is known. Attempts have been made to get away from the 
simple printed representation of the symbols, usually 
fruit such as plums, cherries, oranges and so on, and 
it has been proposed to project the symbols optically 
in turn onto a flat translucent screen, the so-called 
Panascope system. We have ourselves proposed to use 
a video screen on which an electrically generated 
image of the rotating reels is displayed. However 
these alternatives lack the contrast and brightness of 
a colour-printed two-dimensional picture of the symbol 
and so there has lately been a reversion to the 
mechanical reels with the symbols on their peripheries.  
 It has been proposed, in GB 2 183 883 A, to 
provide gaming and amusement machines with symbols 
formed in relief, i.e. in three-dimensions, on the 
periphery of the reel so that they stand out from the 
surface of the reel. The general outline of the use of such symbols in 
relief is described in GB 2 183 833 A, and the 
functional advantages of the such use is intimated. 
The ability, for example, to recognise the symbols 
rapidly is enhanced, which improves the user's 
perception of the game, and the recognition in 
particular of symbols further round the periphery of 
the reel (away from the winline) allows the machine to 
be constructed so that certain game sub-features (such 
as nudging, for example) are possible under conditions 
in which, with conventional flat-printed reel strip 
symbols, they would not otherwise be practicable. Suggested methods of forming symbols in relief, 
which conventionally

<CLAIMS>
A reel for a gaming or amusement machine having a 
reel strip (1, 20) extending circumferentially around a 

support structure which supports the reel strip, at 
spaced-apart locations, the reel strip being 

self-supporting between locations at which it is 
supported, characterised in that the reel strip is 

sufficiently rigid as to contribute 
to the structural strength of the reel as a 

whole, the reel (comprising the reel strip connected to 
the support structure) being stronger 

than the support structure alone. 
A reel strip according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the reel strip is profiled in three dimensions. 
A reel according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the reel strip is supported at 

locations spaced apart circumferentially of the strip. 
A reel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the strip is supported at 

locations spaced apart transversely of the strip. 
A reel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the support structure comprises a 

central hub (63) adapted to be connected to a rotatable 
shaft (64), and a side member (61) comprising a 

plurality of radial spokes (41; 62) extending between 
the hub and the reel strip. 
A reel according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the spokes are interconnected adjacent their outer ends.  

 
A reel according to claim 5 or claim 6, 
characterised in that adjacent spokes are 

interconnected at least at some point along their 
lengths by a web. 
A reel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the support structure comprises a 

plate or dish (61). 
A reel according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the plate or dish (61) has reinforcing ribs (62). 
A reel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that there are two support structures. 
A reel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the support structure comprises a 

groove or channel (76-78; 80-82) which receives an edge 
of the strip (1, 20). 
A reel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that there are two support structures 

each having an outer circumferential region, and cross 
members connecting the two support structures at their 

circumferential regions. 
A reel according to any preceding claim, 
characterised in that the support structure comprises 

two dished plates, or dished spoke structures, provided 
back-to-back and defining a first support 

formation (76-78) at one edge of the strip (1,20) and 
a second support formation (80-82) at the other edge of 

the strip, the strip being supported at its edges by 
the support formations.  

 
A support structure for a reel-strip of a gaming 
or amusement machine, the support structure being 

adapted to support a reel-strip at spaced apart 
locations so as to enable a reel in accordance with any 

one of claims 1 to 13 to be provided. 
A gaming or amusement machine characterised in 
that it incorporates a reel in accordance with any one 

of claims 1 to 13.
