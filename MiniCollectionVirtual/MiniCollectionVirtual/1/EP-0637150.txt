<ABSTRACT>
In a mobile data communications system, a near-end modem (100) 
initiates a data connection to a far-end modem (300) at the highest permissible data 

rate, e.g., at 9600 bits per second (bps). If the communications channel subsequently 
degrades, either the near-end modem, or the far-end modem, initiates an autorate, or 

fallback sequence, e.g., to 4800 bps. However, if channel performance is still poor at 
4800 bps, then one, or both, of the modems initiate a fallback to 1200 bps ― 

skipping over the data rate of 2400 bps, which is not included within the fallback 
sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mobile radio and, more particularly, to 
mobile data communications. A mobile data communications channel is referred to as an "impaired 
channel" since it is affected by a number of channel impairments like Rayleigh 
fading, co-channel interference, etc., that increase the error rate and, thus, degrade 
the overall performance of the mobile data connection. One form of mitigating the 
affects of an impaired channel is to simply apply land-line modem standards to the 
mobile radio environment. In the land-line modem arena, International Telephone and Telegraph 
Consultative Committee (CCITT) standard V.32bis is a representative modulation 
standard. In V.32bis, during the "start-up mode," or "connection phase," both 
modems, or endpoints, establish the data connection, e.g., perform a "handshaking" 
sequence to establish the modulation standard, error control, and the data rate. After 
the start-up mode, the "data mode," or "communications phase" is entered in which 
data, or information, is exchanged between the two modems over the mobile data 
communication channel. One of the features of V.32bis is the ability to sequentially 
"autorate" upwards or downwards between 4800 bits per second (bps) and 14400 bps 
during either the start-up mode or the data mode as a function of the error 
characteristics of the communications channel. For example, if a land-line data 
connection is initially established between two modems at 14400 bps and the error 
rate subsequently increases beyond a predetermined threshold, one, or both, of the 
modems will negotiate a data rate change down to the next lowest data rate. In this 
example, the data rate would change from 14400 bps to 9600 bps. At the latter data 
rate, information is then transmitted for a period of time to monitor the resulting 
error rate. If the error rate is still above a predetermined threshold, one, or both, of 
the modems will, again, negotiate a data rate change down to 4800 bps. On the other 
hand, if the error rate decreases for a period of time while transmitting data at 9600 
bps, one, or both, of the modems will negotiate a data rate change to the next highest 
data rate, i.e., from 9600 bps to 14400 bps. In either event, the autorate feature takes 
advantage of the fact that the error rate of a communications channel is typically also 
a function of the data rate, i.e., the higher the data rate, the likelihood of an error 
increases.  Thus, in the context of a mobile data communications channel, the 
land-line
