<ABSTRACT>
In order to equalize the voltages of batteries ( 1 to n) 
connected in series during recharging, the voltage (V₁ to V
n
) and 
the temperature (T₁ to T
n
) of each battery are measured and only 
the battery with the lowest voltage is charged with 

higher-intensity current, a current bypass being 
applied to the other batteries; the steps are repeated 

until all the batteries (1 to n) have reched the same voltage 
in relation to the temperature measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of equalizing
the voltages across drive batteries connected in series
during recharging, for electric vehicles, and to a
device for implementing the method.In order to operate, electric vehicles require a large
number of drive batteries which are connected in series
and, at the moment, are usually lead-acid or lead-gel
(recombination) batteries.Whatever type of battery is used, the autonomy of the
vehicle is fairly limited and it is therefore necessary
to provide for very frequent recharging of the
batteries by means of a battery charger which may be in
the vehicle or on the ground and which supplies
electrical energy to the batteries, taking it from the
mains.Because they are arranged in series in the vehicle, and
because of the difficulty of charging them in parallel
(in fact, it would be necessary to have access to each
individual battery), recharging is effected in series,
and the charging current is therefore the same for all
the batteries.It is also known that there are small voltage
differences between one battery and another; these
differences may be intrinsic in the construction of the
batteries themselves or may be due to different storage
periods before fitting in the vehicle, or simply to
different temperatures from one battery to another.Clearly, if charging is carried out in series, even small 
voltage differences between the various batteries are not
compensated, on the contrary they will be increased with each
recharging cycle.It is also known that a battery which is overcharged or
undercharged in comparison with the others will quickly
be damaged, completely jeopardizing the use of the
vehicle in which it is fitted. Methods of equalizing the voltage across
drive batteries connected in series are known from WO-A-93 08 629
and US-A-4 238 721. The object of the
present invention is to provide a method of equalizing
the voltages across drive batteries connected in series
during recharging, for electric vehicles, which enables
the voltage in all the batteries making up the series
to be equalized.The present invention achieves the aforesaid object by
virtue of a method of equalizing the voltage across
drive batteries connected in series during recharging,
for electric vehicles according to claim 1. The invention also comprises a device for implementing
the method given above, having the characteristics specifically referred to in the following claims 2-4. The invention will now be described by way of
non-limiting example, with reference to the
