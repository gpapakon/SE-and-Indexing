<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus for suppressing cell howl with negligible
impact on engine test conditions are described. The apparatus (100), in an

exemplary embodiment, includes a flow distorter (102) configured to be
positioned close to a nozzle exit (E) of an engine nozzle, and a flow distorter

support (104) for maintaining the flow distorter (102) at a selected location.
The flow distorter (102) is adjustably secured to the support (104) so that a

distance at which a tip (106) of the distorter (102) is located relative to support
(104) is adjustable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to turbine engines, and more specifically, to reducing, if not eliminating, an intense acoustic tone emitted during certain test operating conditions of such engines.For testing, turbine engines typically are enclosed within a test cell. The test cell is sufficiently large so that the engine is completed enclosed within the cell, and test operators can move about the cell to set test parameters and check engine performance. Under certain operating conditions, and with the engine located within a test cell, an intense acoustic tone is emitted. This tone sometimes is referred to as "cell howl".The intensity of the tone can sometimes damage the test cell and engine. Known attempts to eliminate cell howl, as described in Jones et al., The Acoustic Response Of Altitude Test Facility Exhaust Systems To Axisymmetric And Two-Dimensional Turbine Engine Exhaust Plumes, DGLR/AIAA 92-02-131, May, 1992, include attempting to optimize a location of the cell exhaust collector relative to an engine nozzle exit, injecting water in an engine exhaust plume, locating volume resonators in the cell exhaust collector, and inserting a secondary concentric duct into the exhaust collector. These known attempts have not proven one hundred percent successful in eliminating cell howl for all engine nozzles, and the howl generated by some nozzles is not even always reduced.US 4,168,763 discloses a ring of tubes that extends inwardly from a noise suppressor housing wall sufficiently far to impinge upon the periphery of the high velocity core of a supersonic jet exhaust to disrupt the core and reduce the sound power generated.GB-A-2 288 209 discloses a noise suppressor for a gas turbine engine test bed comprising a duct through which the engine exhaust gases flow.The present invention, in one aspect, relates to a flow distorter method and apparatus which suppresses cell howl with negligible impact on engine test conditions according to claims 1 and 4. The apparatus, in an exemplary embodiment, includes a flow distorter configured to be positioned close to a nozzle exit of an engine nozzle, and a flow distorter support for maintaining the flow distorter at a selected location.The flow distorter is adjustably secured to the support so that a distance at which a tip of the distorter is located relative to support is adjustable. More specifically, and in an exemplary embodiment, the support includes a base having an adjustable track to enable axial adjustment of the flow distorter relative to a nozzle exit
