<ABSTRACT>
A semi-rigid beverage package containing one or 
more beverage ingredients which package (10) comprises a 

top (11), a bottom (12) and a side wall portion (13) the top (11) and the 
bottom (12) being made from one or more layers of the same 

or different water-permeable materials and at least 
one of the top (11) or the bottom (12) of the package (10) being 

provided with areas formed therein which are 
impermeable (6) or of varying permeability to the flow of 

water, whereby, in use, water flows through the 
package (10) in a pre-determined flow pattern to achieve 

immediate wetting of the total contents (16) of the 
package. 
The beverage package (10) preferably contains leaf tea 
or roast and ground coffee.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to beverage 
packages and, in particular, to beverage packages 
containing leaf tea or ground coffee which are 
intended to provide an infusion of tea or coffee, 
respectively. The production of freshly brewed tea or coffee 
involves contacting tea leaves or roast and ground 
coffee with hot water and separating the beverage 
from the tea leaves or coffee grounds. Various 
methods for the production of freshly brewed coffee 
or tea are well known. For example, tea is prepared 
traditionally in a teapot, the tea leaves being 
immersed in boiling water and allowed to stand before 
being poured from the pot. Freshly brewed coffee may 
be prepared by the continuous passage of hot water 
through roast and ground coffee contained in a filter 
and the coffee collected in a jug or other 
receptacle, or by percolation which involves the 
continuous recycling of water through the roast and 
ground coffee. It has previously been proposed to seal fresh 
roast and ground coffee or tea leaves in individual 
air-impermeable packages. For example, cartridges or 
capsules containing compacted ground coffee are known 
for use in certain coffee making machines which are 
generally termed "espresso" machines. In the 
production of coffee using these coffee machines the 
coffee cartridge is placed in a brewing chamber and 
hot water is generally caused to pass under pressure 
through the cartridge, thereby extracting the 
aromatic coffee constitutents from the ground coffee 
and producing a coffee beverage. Cartridges containing roast and ground coffee in 
which hot water flows under gravimetric force through  
 
the cartridge are also known. A cartridge of this 
general type is described in British Patent No. 
1397116. The cartridges for use in "espresso" machines and 
those through which water flows under gravimetric 
force contain a filter positioned beneath the charge 
of coffee. In the production of coffee from these 
cartridges water is generally injected into the 
coffee containing cartridge through a needle. The 
cartridge is filled with water which flows through 
the filter and is collected in a cup or other 
receptacle. U.S. Patent No. 4446158 describes a disposable 
individual beverage forming container and filter unit 
comprising a flat frame having an apertured centre 
section, filter layers covering the top and bottom of 
the frame and being secured thereto, and individual 
quantities of coffee received in compartments formed 
in the frame between spider-like centre sections 
there
