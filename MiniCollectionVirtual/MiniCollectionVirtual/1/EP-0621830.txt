<ABSTRACT>
Wheel hub and brake disc arrangement for a vehicle wheel. The wheel hub presents a region to which a brake disc is non-rotatably affixed. In the hub, between the brake disc supporting region and a bearing which carries the hub, a circular channel (23) is provided which is open on one side of the hub (2). The channel serves to increase the heat transfer path from the disc to the bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel hub and brake disc 
arrangement for a vehicle wheel, comprising a hub rotatably 
carried on a shaft portion and presenting a region to which a 
brake disc is non-rotatably affixed. Disc brakes have previously predominantly only been used for 
cars and commercial vehicles up to about 16 tonnes in weight. 
For the heaviest class of truck, drum brakes have until now 
been almost exclusively used due i.a. to the extremely high 
braking torque (around 2000 kpm) in combination with the brake 
shoes which apply the braking effect creating problems. More 
specifically, these problems are due to two aspects. Firstly, 
the intense heating up of the brake disc friction surfaces to 
a temperature which inevitably is higher than the temperature 
of the disc hub subjects the hub to thermal stresses which may 
cause the hub to fracture. Secondly, heating of the disc 
results in heat transfer from the disc via the hub to internal 
components which should not be exposed to temperature 
increases, for example the hub's bearing assembly. Both these 
factors contribute to the creation of large thermal stresses, 
which has restricted the use to those applications in which the 
temperature of the disc could be limited to an acceptable level. A wheel hub and brake disc arrangement for heavy trucks according 
to the preamble of claim 1 is known from DE-A-3 025 798. The object of the present invention is to 
develop a hub and brake disc arrangement which can replace 
previously employed drum brakes for the heaviest class of 
vehicles. More precisely, the object is to provide a hub and brake disc 
arrangement of the type according to the preamble of claim 1 
which is so formed that heat-sensitive components, such as  
 
bearings or similar, are not subjected to damaging thermal 
loads during extreme heating of the brake disc under braking. 
This is achieved in accordance with the present invention by 
the provision of a annular channel, open on one side of the 
hub, located in the hub radially inside of the brake disc 
supporting region. The annular channel serves to restrict heat 
transfer from the disc to heat-sensitive components, such as 
bearings and the like, located radially inwardly of the disc. The invention will be described in greater detail by way of 
example and with reference to the attached drawing which shows 
a partial sectional elevational view of a wheel axle with a hub 
and brake disc arrangement according to the invention. In the drawing, reference numeral 1 denotes

<CLAIMS>
Wheel hub and brake disc arrangement for a vehicle wheel 
(31), comprising a hub (6) rotatably carried on a shaft 

portion (5), which hub presents a region (12) to which a 
brake disc (8) is non-rotatably affixed, 
characterized in
 
that the brake disc supporting region (12) radially inside of 

the brake disc (8) is provided with a annular channel (23), 
bounded by spaced, concentric and axially extending wall 

portions and open on one side of the hub (6). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that 
the wheel hub (6) comprises a substantially cylindrical hub 

section (32) which merges into a radial flange portion (30) 
to which a wheel (31) is intended to be securely screwed, and 

in that the annular channel (23) extends through the entire 
cylindrical section up to the flange portion. 
Arrangement according to claim 2, 
characterized in
 that 
the annular channel (23) is open towards the end of the 

cylindrical hub section which faces away from the flange 
portion. 
Arrangement according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in
 
that the annular channel (23) has a width which corresponds 

to approximately one third of the thickness of the 
cylindrical section (32) of the hub (6). 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 2 to 4, 

characterized in
 that brake disc supporting region of the hub 
is provided with closely spaced V-shaped ridges (10) and 

troughs (11) which extend essentially up to the end of the 
hub section which faces away from the flange portion (30).  

 
Arrangement according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterized in
 that the annular channel (23) is located 
radially externally of the bearing assembly (7) which is 

carried on the stub axle (5). 
Arrangement according to claim 6, 
characterized in
 that 
the brake disc supporting region of the hub and the bearings 

(7) lie substantially in a common radial plane. 
Arrangement according to claim 6, 
characterized in
 that 
the bearings lie in a radial plane which is axially displaced 

with respect to the plane occupied by the brake disc 
supporting region. 
Arrangement according to claim 8, 
characterized in
 that 
the part of the hub which is located radially inside of the 

annular channel (23) has an axial extension which is shorter than 
that of the brake disc supporting region (12).
