Apparatus for coupling two containers (10, 12) 
each having a connecting spout (16, 32) of 

substantially circular cross-section, wherein each of 
the spouts (16, 32) has, near its end remote from the 

container (10, 12) bearing it, a closure flap (26, 34) 
which is pivotable through substantially 90Â° about a 

diameter of the spout (16, 32) and the outside diameter 
of which corresponds substantially to the inside 

diameter of the spout (16, 32), each closure flap being 
of substantially circular cross-section and being 

transferable by means of a pivoting drive (28) from a 
closed position, in which it is situated substantially 

transversely of the central longitudinal axis of the 
associated spout (16, 32), into an open position in 

which it is substantially parallel to the central 
longitudinal axis of the associated spout (16, 32), 

wherein the closure flaps (26, 34) are so mounted, each 
by means of a half axle (44, 46), of substantially 

semi-circle segmental cross-section, the flat end face 
(48, 50) of which remote from the container (10, 12) 

bearing the respective spout (16, 32) is substantially 
in alignment with the end face of the associated 

closure flap (26, 34) remote from the associated 
container (10, 12) and which are rigidly connected to 

the respective closure flap, that the end faces (48, 
50) in the closed position are in alignment with the 

end face of the respective spout (16, 32), wherein, 
after the end faces of the spouts (16, 32) have been 

pressed into centred contact with one another, the two 
closure flaps (26, 34) are pivotable by means of the 

pivoting drive (28) between their closed position and 
their open position about a full axle formed by the two  

 
half axles (44, 46), characterised in that the closure 

flaps (26, 34) are mounted in respectively 
diametrically opposite bearing
 bushes (40, 42) 
complementary to the respective half axle, in that only 

one (44) of the half axles (44, 46) can be directly 
actuated by the pivoting drive (28), in that the 

closure flaps (26, 34) are pivotable in the bearing 
formed by the two bearing bushes (42, 44), the not 

directly driven closure flap (34) being entrained, and 
in that the closure flaps (26, 34) are each mounted in 

a substantially circular sealing bead (58, 52) of a 
cross-sectional configuration such that the circular 

annular end face of the respective spout (16, 32) is so 
covered, in a condition in which the associated closure 

flap (26, 34) is closed and the other spout is not 
pressed into contact, covering being effected by the 

sealing bead, which simultaneously provides a sealed 
mounting for the associated closure flap, that an end 

sealing surface (56, 54) of the respective sealing bead 
remote from the spout so slopes obliquely radially 

outwards in the direction of the other spout requiring 
to be connected that when the two spouts are pressed 

into contact with the joint sealed by the end sealing 
surfaces (54, 56) those zones of the two sealing beads 

(52, 56) which are near the sealing surface are pressed 
radially outwards and relieve the closure flaps (26, 

34) for pivoting, so that a cylindrical cross-section 
is maintained and the gap between the closure flaps 

(26, 34) is securely closed. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the pivoting drive (28) is releasably connectable 

to one (44) of the half axles (44, 46).  
 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the spout (16) having the half axle (44) 

releasably connectable to the pivoting drive (28) is 
mounted on a stationary container and the other spout 

(32) is mounted on a movable container. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the 

spouts (16, 32) has a floating mounting. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the spouts (16, 32) have 

rough centring means (30, 36) which are complementary 
to one another. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the closure flaps (26, 

34) and/or their half axles (44, 46) have fine centring 
means complementary to one another. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that when the two spouts (16, 32) are in the separated 

state the sealing bead (52, 58) covers the edge of the 
closure flaps (26, 34). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, chracterised in 
that at least one of the two closure flaps (26, 34) has 

a flexible sealing bead at the outer annular surface so 
that after joining and opening of the closure flaps the 

flap halves are sealed off from one another. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the 

closure flaps (26, 34) has blast means for blowing  
 

cleaning and/or protective gas into the junction 
chamber forming between the closure flaps pressed into 

contact. 
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterised by a 
suction chamber surrounding the junction chamber. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the 

bearing bushes (40, 42) consists of friction material. 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the closure flaps (26, 

34) are adapted to tip substantially completely out of 
the bearing bushes (40, 42) about a tipping axis 

situated substantially perpendicularly to their 
respective half axle (44, 46).
