<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder pressure sensor (100) of the annular 
insert type disposed within an access well of an internal 

combustion engine to measure the flexure of a first wall 
relative to a second wall along a response axis has 

low-cost components thereof requiring only simple 
sequential assembly in axial stacked fashion providing 

contaminant protection and electrical shielding of the 
sensing element (130). The cylinder pressure sensor 

comprises a substantially cylindrical sleeve (110) with a 
terminal end thereof being outwardly upwardly cupped to 

define an annular channel (115), the annular channel 
having a bottom portion (114) thereof substantially 

normal to the sleeve for engagement with the first wall; 
an annular load sensing element (130) disposed within the 

annular channel; a substantially cylindrical mounting 
shell (150) having a lower portion (151) nested within 

the annular channel and in communication with the sensing 
element, an upper portion (152) for engagement with the 

second wall, and an axial conduit (155) therethrough; a 
substantially cylindrical annular bonnet (160) having a 

top portion (161) and a finger (162) depending axially 
therefrom, the top portion being positioned adjacent the 

mounting shell with the finger disposed within the axial 
conduit thereby providing a carrier for electrically 

conductive material to a terminal (190) at the distal end 
of the finger; and means (180,181) for sealing the 

sensing element from contamination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cylinder pressure
sensors for internal combustion engines, more
particularly a non-intrusive cylinder pressure sensor.
Such a sensor is disclosed in US-A- 4,969,352. In the
disclosure of this publication such a sensor finds
particular utility when mounted in a spark plug access
well.It is known in the field relating to internal
combustion engines to utilise cylinder pressure sensors
for monitoring and controlling various processes, among
them being combustion knock, misfire and associated
combustion dilution and combustion phasing. Delivery of
fuel and exhaust gas recirculation and timing of ignition
may then be optimised accordingly. In order for cylinder
pressure sensing to find its way into the mainstream of
commercial automotive applications, it must be cost
effective. Advances to making pressure sensing cost
effective have been made as shown in US-A-4,969,352
wherein simple modifications to pre-existing engine head
features provide necessary mounting provisions for
non-intrusive sensors. Another way to advance cost
effectiveness is by reducing piece price. This is
especially true where multiple sensors (i.e. one per
cylinder) are to be used in a single vehicle. Therefore,
innovative designs which reduce piece price by
simplifying manufacturing and assembly are highly
favoured.US-A-4,969,352 shows a sensor having a
castellated lower portion effective to allow axial
compressive forces to act on a trapped sensing element
while bypassing torsional loads around the load sensing
element. Another approach accomplishing the same is also
shown wherein an integral axial extension from the major
portion of the annular insert extends downward therefrom 
and is bent in an outward flange arrangement to trap the
sensing element between the flange portion and the major
portion of the annular insert. Such arrangements
accomplish the objective of bypassing torsional loads
around the sensing element, however, they also leave the
sensing element and electrical connections exposed to
infusion of such common deleterious materials as oil,
road salt and water. Additionally, such arrangements are
relatively complex and costly and may not be necessary
where the sensing element can sufficiently cope with the
torsional loads expected. It is desirable to simplify
sensor packaging and ensure that the sensing element and
electrical connections are adequately shielded from
electromagnetic interference and sealed against
contaminant infusion.In order to obtain a signal from such a sensor
it is necessary
