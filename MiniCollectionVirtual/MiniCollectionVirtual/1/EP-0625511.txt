<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel group of compounds
which are useful in the treatment of bladder instability in mammals
such as man. More specifically, this invention relates to this
group of compounds, their use in the treatment of urinary
incontinence in mammals (including man), processes for preparing
them and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.It is known that bladder tissue is excitable and that
urinary incontinence can be caused by uncontrolled or unstable
bladder contractions. A group of compounds have been found that
are unexpectedly capable of relaxing bladder smooth muscle, thus
preventing or ameliorating uncontrolled or unstable bladder
contractions. Hence, the compounds may be useful for the treatment
of urge incontinence, which includes for example detrusor
instability, which may result from cystitis, urethritis, tumors,
stones, diverticuli or outflow obstruction; and detrusor
hyperreflexia, which may result from stroke, dementia, Parkinsons,
suprasacral spinalcord injury or suprasacral spinalcord disease.
In J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79, 4391-4394 (1957) the preparation of some
benzimidazolyl analogs of ethyl pteroylglutamate is described but
compounds of the present invention are not disclosed. In the US
patent US-A-3 214 429 are described quinazolinones, processes for
their preparation, their use as diuretics, bronchodilators,
hypotensives and choleretic properties of such compounds; the
patent does not disclose compounds of the present invention.This invention provides a compound of formula I (formula
set out, together with other formulae referred to by Roman
numerals, on pages following the Examples), wherein:
one of R1 and R2 represents hydrogen and the other
represents nitro, cyano, halogeno, trifluoromethyl,
pentafluoroethyl, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoromethylsulphonyl,
methanesulphonyl or a group of formula ArL in whichL is CO or SO2; andAr is pyridyl, pyrimidyl or phenyl, said phenyl being
unsubstituted or substituted by one or two substituents
independently selected from halogeno, hydroxy, cyano, (1-4C)alkyl
and (1-4C)alkoxy; Y is an sp2-hybridised carbon atom and X, Y and Z,
together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached form a 5- or
6-membered heterocyclic ring wherein each ring heteroatom is
selected from O, N and S, and one ring carbon atom may optionally
be substituted by hydroxy;R3 and R4 are independently (1-3C)alkyl substituted by
from 0 to 2k+1 atoms selected from fluoro and chloro wherein k is
the number of carbon atoms in the said (1-3C)alkyl, provided
