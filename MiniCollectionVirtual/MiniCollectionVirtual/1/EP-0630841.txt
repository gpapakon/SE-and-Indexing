<ABSTRACT>
Each protrusion on the vertical plates is formed by one arm (18) of an angular component (17) whose other arm (20) is fixed detachably behind the plate (16). It can be secured by a nut protruding towards the recess in the ramp in which the plate is accommodated. The component can be a piece of equilateral angle-iron with the flanges at right angles. The recess or drilling in the vertical plate can be near the bottom edge, so that the component does not protrude in the rest position.

Transfer bridge for platforms (4), having a bridge 
plate (1) which is pivotable at its platform end about a 

horizontal axis (3), said bridge plate being provided at 
its free end with an extension member (2) for support on 

the deck to be loaded or unloaded and being provided on 
both sides with vertical protective plates (16), which 

bridge the gap between the bridge plate (1) and the 
platform (4) when the bridge plate (1) has been pivoted 

upwardly, a projection member being disposed on the 
protective plates (16), which projection member is 

displaceable from an inoperative position behind the 
protective plates (16) through the protective plates (16) 

into an operative position, in which it protrudes 
laterally, lies on the platform (4) when the bridge plate 

(1) has been pivoted upwardly and ensures that the bridge 
plate (1) does not drop accidentally, characterised in that 

the projection member is formed by a flange (18) of an 
angle (17), the other flange (20) of said angle being 

disposed and detachably mounted behind the protective plate 
(16). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a screw-connection (21) is associated with the flange (20) 

mounted on the protective plate (16), the screw element 

(nut) of said screw-connection facing the recess (5) in the 
platform, which recess serves to accommodate the bridge 

plate (1). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the angle (17) is a portion of an angle member, which is 

preferably equal-flanged with flanges lying at right angles 
to each other. 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a bore (19) or recess in the protective plate (16),  

 
provided for the flanges (18) forming the projection 

member, is disposed close to the lower edge of the 
protective plates (16) in such a manner that the angle (17) 

in its inoperative position does not, or does not 
significantly, protrude beyond the protective plate (16). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the angle (17) is pivotally mounted at the free end of its 

other flange (20) internally on the protective plate (16). 
Bridge according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the angle (17) is pivotable from an inoperative position 

(Fig. 7) into the operative position, the flange (18) which 
forms the projection member passing through the protective 

plate (16). 
Bridge according to claims 1, 6 and 7, 
characterized in that the two flanges (18,20) are pivotally 

interconnected, but the two flanges may not form with each 
other an angle which is smaller than substantially 90Â°. 
Bridge according to claims 1, 2 and 3, 
characterized in that the other flange (20) abuts in the 

inoperative position with its external face against the 
inside of the protective plate (16) and in the operative 

position with its internal face against the internal face 
of the protective plate (16). 
Bridge according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the bore (19) or recess in the protective plate (16), 

provided for a flange (18) to pass therethrough, is 
closable by a removable cover or slide (25).
