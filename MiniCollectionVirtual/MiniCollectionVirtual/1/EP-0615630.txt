<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a display cell comprising two opposite
plates which are transparent to light as the substrate, which plates are
provided with an electrode of a material which is transparent to light on the
sides facing each other, said electrode carrying an orientation layer and a
sealing material being provided between the ends of the plates, a liquid-crystalline
material being introduced in the space between the plates and the
sealing material which is in the form of, for example, a ring,

wherein the liquid crystal material is composed of at least two different liquid
crystalline materials and the liquid crystalline material is in the form of an
anisotropic gel consisting of a polymerized monotropic or enantiotropic
liquid crystalline material and a low-molecular liquid crystalline material,
wherein the polymerized material a) forms a permanently oriented network
in the low-molecular weight liquid crystalline material b), characterized in
that the low-molecular weight liquid crystalline material b) exhibits a
dielectric anisotropy ▵ε <-0.5, and is homeotropically aligned by the orientation layers between
the electrodes.In European Patent Application EP 451 905 a liquid crystalline material in
the form of an anisotropic gel comprising a polymerized liquid crystalline
material and a low-molecular liquid crystalline material which exhibits a
positive dielectric anisotropy. Furthermore EP 451 905 suggests also the
use of low-molecular liquid crystalline material with a negative dielectric
anisotropy, but there is no hint that such gels do not produce polarized light,
operate at low voltages, being compatible with active matrix addressing and
have fast response times.In accordance with the invention, a liquid crystalline material as described
in the opening paragraph is obtained, wherein polymerized material a)
forms a permanently oriented network in the low-molecular liquid weight
crystalline material b), characterized in that the low-molecular weight liquid
crystalline material exhibits a dielectric anisotropy Δε < -0.5. Preferably,
said material b) forms a continuous phase around the network of material
a). Preferred embodiments of the invention are:
a) A liquid crystalline material wherein material a) is selected from
acrylates, epoxy compounds, vinyl ether compounds and thiolene
compounds.b) A liquid crystalline material wherein material b) is a liquid crystalline
medium comprising at least two components wherein at least one
component is a mesogenic compound comprising a structure element
