<ABSTRACT>
Process for the manufacture of a composite material made of an organic substance reinforced with glass filaments. The invention consists in the combined use of an organic substance and of glass filaments coated with a size consisting of a solution whose solvent content is lower than 5 % by weight, the said solution including a mixture of components capable of being polymerised and/or crosslinked by heat treatment, the said components being, in the case of at least 60 % thereof, components whose molecular mass is lower than 750 and from 0 to 25 % by weight of bridging agents, lubricating agents, stabilising agents, initiators and/or catalysts of polymerisation, the said agents and initiators being optionally polymerisable and/or crosslinkable, the said size not being polymerised, and in then subjecting the whole to a heat treatment and/or to the action of an actinic radiation.

Method of manufacturing a composite material formed by
the combination of glass strands and of an organic

substance, consisting of the use of glass strands coated
with a sizing composition constituted by a solution the

solvent content of which is less than 5% by weight, the said
solution comprising a mixture of components which can be

polymerized and/or cross-linked by heat treatment, amongst
the said components, at least 60% by weight being components

the molecular weights of which are less than 750, less than
10% by weight being film-forming agents, and from 0 to 25%

by weight being bridging agents, lubricating agents,
stabilizing agents, and initiators and/or catalysts of

polymerization by heat treatment, the said agents and
initiators optionally being capable of being polymerized

and/or cross-linked by heat treatment, of the combination of
the organic substance and the said glass strands, coated

with the said non-polymerized sizing composition, and of the
subsequent subjection of the assembly to heat treatment

and/or to the action of actinic radiation.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
glass strands combined with the organic substance are coated

with a sizing composition constituted by a solution
comprising a mixture of components which can be polymerized

and/or cross-linked, at least 60% by weight of the mixture
being constituted by components the molecular weights of

which are less than 500.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 and 2,

characterized in that
 the glass strands combined with the
organic substance are coated with a sizing composition

constituted by a solution comprising a mixture of components 
which can be polymerized and/or cross linked, at least 60%

by weight of the mixture being constituted by monomers.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the glass strands combined with the
organic substance are coated with a sizing composition

constituted by a solution which comprises at least 70% of
compounds which can be polymerised and/or cross linked.
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the
glass strands combined with the organic substance are coated

with a sizing composition constituted by a solution which
comprises between 75 and 100% of compounds which can be

polymerized and/or cross linked.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the glass strands combined with the
organic substance are coated with a sizing composition

constituted by a solution without solvent.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the strands combined with the organic
substance are coated with a sizing composition constituted

by a solution which may comprise up to 5% by weight of
film-forming agents selected from derivatives of silicones

and/or siloxanes.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the strands combined with the organic
substance are coated with a sizing composition constituted

by a solution which may comprise up to 15% by weight of
bridging agents in the form of organo-silanes. 
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the strands combined with the organic
substance are coated with a sizing composition constituted

by a solution which may comprise up to 8% by weight of
lubricating agents such as fatty esters or glycol esters.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the strands combined with the organic
substance are coated with a sizing composition constituted

by a solution which, in the absence of stabilizing agents,
may comprise up to 4% by weight of polymerization

initiators.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims,


characterized in that
 the strands combined with the organic
substance are coated with a sizing composition constituted

by a solution which may comprise up to 3% by weight of
stabilizing agents.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 an
organic substance comprising at least one polymerization

initiator and/or catalyst and/or copolymerization agent, and
glass strands coated with a sizing composition constituted

by a solution free of polymerization initiator and/or
catalyst are combined.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 an
organic substance comprising at least one polymerization

initiator and/or catalyst and/or copolymerization agent, and
glass strands coated with a sizing composition constituted

by a solution comprising at least one polymerization
initiator and/or catalyst are combined. 
Method according to Claim 13, 
characterized in that
 the
sizing composition constituted by a solution which is

deposited on the glass strands comprises a stabilizing
agent.
