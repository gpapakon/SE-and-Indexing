<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet for
marking and a marked sheet member used for display and
decoration in the form to be stuck on the surfaces of
substances such as buildings, building materials,
vehicles, ships, machines, instruments, sundry goods,
household articles, or toys. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a large size marked sheet
having a clear and precise pattern used for interior
decorations such as a wall sheet, sliding door sheet,
and window glass decorative sheet; and a sheet for
marking which is used as a material for manufacturing
the above marked sheet. The present invention further
concerns a method of simply manufacturing the above
marked sheet member at a low cost.In a conventional marked film, a character or
pattern has been usually printed on one surface of a
resin film by screen printing or gravure printing. 
Additionally, as a sheet for interior decoration such as
a wall sheet, a type using a polyvinyl chloride resin
film has been generally applied, because the polyvinyl
chloride resin film exhibits a soft feeling and calm
brightness, and easily forms a three-dimensional
patterning on the surface.In the conventional marked film sheet, patterns
have been repetitive and relatively simple, and further
the selection of the pattern has been restrictively
performed from ready-made patterns, and accordingly, a
user could not easily obtain a marked sheet having a
desired pattern with original design.The conventional marked film sheet, which forms
each pattern by printing, has a disadvantage in that it
must make a stereotype plate for each pattern. For
example, even in manufacturing marked film sheets having
a desired pattern with original design on a small scale
(amount required for personal use), there are required
the equipment, labor and cost being substantially the
same as in the mass-production of ready-made sheets.
Additionally, the conventional marked sheet has a
limitation in continuously forming a multi-color and
precise pattern or a complex pattern without any
repetition. Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. JP-A-5-165246
discloses a marked film sheet in which a pattern
is formed using a color copying machine of
electrophotographing type. This method enables a
suitable pattern to be relatively easily formed.
However, the method using the electrophotographing
technique requires a plurality of photosensitive drums
each having a size equivalent to the width of a
substance to be copied for forming a toner image and
transferring the image to the
