<ABSTRACT>
An optical connector include an optical connector 
ferrule (3) capable of fixing optical fibers (4), optical fibers fixed 

on the optical connector ferrule the end surface of which is 
projected from an end surface of the optical connector ferrule, 

an adhesive (31) for fixing the optical fibers on the optical 
connector ferrule, and a low Young's Modulus member (26), whose 

Young'a Modulus is smaller than that of the optical fiber, is 
provided on the end surface of the optical connector ferrule at 

least around the projected portions of the optical fibers. 
When the end surface of the optical connector is 
polished, even if the end surface portion contains a filler the 

hardness of which is smaller than that of the optical fiber, 
the top end of the optical fiber is capable of projecting from 

the end surface of the optical connector ferrule.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical connector for
connecting optical fibers.In an optical connector that connects optical fibers,
(1) reflected return rays at a connecting node must be reduced
(implementation of low reflection); and (2) rays not being
propagated to the light-receiving side due to their returning
backward or being scattered by reflection at a connecting node
must be reduced (reduction in reflection loss).To meet these requirements, physical contact (PC)
coupling (direct contact coupling between optical fibers) is
under study for single fiber connectors. For example, a
polishing wheel dedicated to. optical connectors such as
disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho.
61-137107 has been developed.On the other hand, for multi-fiber connectors, it is
difficult to achieve physical contact coupling for all the
fibers. Conventionally, in order to reduce reflection, the end
surfaces has been polished obliquely to connect the polished
surfaces. However, since this method is not successful to get
rid of reflection loss, the optical connectors are coupled by
interposing an index matching agent having substantially the 
same refractive index as that of the optical fiber core between
the end surfaces of the optical fibers.However, the connection made by interposing the index
matching agent between the end surfaces of the optical fibers
must involve the step of applying the index matching agent.
Accordingly, this structure has a disadvantage in terms of
operability and handling and, in addition, easily admits
contaminations between the end surfaces of the optical fibers,
which is a problem.In view of such circumstances, a coupling method
without using the index matching agent has been under study for
multi-fiber connectors. Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication
No. Hei. 4-34403 discloses a method of connecting optical
connectors in which a. resin film having a refractive index
close to that of the fiber is arranged at an end surface of the
optical connector to connect the optical connectors through the
resin film.However, according to the above-mentioned method of
providing a resin film having a refractive index close to that
of the core on the end surface of the optical connector, a thin
resin film is present on the end surface of the optical
connector. Accordingly, such an optical fiber not only impairs
reliability for the function of coupling the optical connectors
over a long period of time, but also leads to a disadvantage in
corrosion resistance as well as coupling strength.
