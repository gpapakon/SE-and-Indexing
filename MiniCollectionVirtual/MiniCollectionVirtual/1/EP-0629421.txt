<ABSTRACT>
A methanol refining column (128) and method using an 
intermediate reboiler (152) are disclosed. Use of the 

intermediate reboiler reduces methanol production energy 
requirements. A side stream (144,162) at or near a fusel oil take-off 

point is heated in an intermediate reboiler (152) by a low 
temperature heating medium (relative to a bottoms 

reboiler) and returned to the column at or near (166) the fusel 
oil take-off tray. The take-off tray is operated at 85-110°C, 

and 70-90 percent of the reboiler duty is supplied 
through the intermediate reboiler. The remaining heat 

load is supplied by a bottoms steam reboiler.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a methanol plant, and 
in particular to an energy-efficient methanol 
purification column having an intermediate reboiler. Efforts to reduce manufacturing costs of chemical 
products are on-going with particular attention directed 
to reducing energy costs by implementing heat integration 
design, that is, the process-wide pairing of 
heat-releasing streams with heat-accepting streams. In 
addition, energy usage has been lowered by the adoption 
of more thermodynamically efficient design of unit 
processes such as distillation, heat exchange, and the 
like. Distillation, although energy intensive, is a very 
common separation technique in the chemical and 
petrochemical industries. Distillation processes consume 
on the order of 95 percent of the energy used for all 
separation processes. Heretofore, most distillation 
designs have not been very good at determining 
thermodynamic efficiency due to past difficulty in 
evaluating the internal dynamics. As is well known, a reversible process is most 
efficient from a thermodynamic perspective. Insofar as a 
process deviates from the reversible ideal, more energy 
is required than the theoretical minimum. The difference 
between the actual work (energy) which a process requires  
 
and its reversible work is defined as lost work. By 
analyzing a process for irreversible elements, it is 
possible to determine improvements which can increase 
efficiency and reduce energy consumption. A general 
background discussion of some thermodynamic concepts as 
applied to distillation columns is presented in Ognisty, 
"Thermodynamic Analysis of Distillation Columns," Paper 
No. 21a, 1993 A.I.Ch.E. Spring National Meeting, March 
30, 1993, incorporated herein by reference. Kaibel, G. et al., Gas Separation and Processing, Vol. 
4, No. 2, June 1990, pp. 109-114; and Kaibel, G., 
International Chemical Engineering, Vol. 32, No. 4, 
October 1992, pp. 631-641; describe analysis of 
distillation systems to improve thermodynamic efficiency 
for reduction of energy usage. In a distillation process, heat is converted into 
work, namely, the separation of one or more chemical 
components from a mixture thereof. Areas of lost work 
include fluid flow momentum losses (pressure drop) and 
the presence of driving forces which are at great 
disequilibrium. Examples of these driving forces include 
heat transfer between fluids having different 
temperatures, such as mixing fluids at different 
temperatures, and mass transfer between streams which are 
no
