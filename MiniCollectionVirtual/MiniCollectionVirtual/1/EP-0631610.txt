<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous cleaning composition comprises dye, preferably an acid dye, which is substantive to protein; water-miscible solvent; and surfactant, preferably alkoxylated surfactant. The dye can bind to protein to form a visible coloured complex and so reveal soil, with the surfactant (and also to some extent the solvent) performing a cleaning function to remove soil. By visualising protein, soil can be targetted for cleaning. Any dye remaining visible after cleaning indicates imperfect cleaning.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cleaning compositions and concerns compositions including a 
component for disclosing the presence of otherwise invisible soil generally mainly of 
organic origin, and a component for cleaning soil. The invention also concerns a method 
of cleaning. Soil (ie dirt or contamination) of mainly organic origin typically comprises protein, 
carbohydrate and/or fat, and is generally associated with bacterial or microbial 
contamination which may present a risk to health. In order to visualise soil it is 
convenient to use a reagent, such as certain dyes, which binds protein. By disclosing 
protein-containing soil, the location of associated bacterial or microbial contamination 
can be indirectly visualised and can be targeted for effective cleaning. JP 63/159758 (Oguri) concerns toilet seat cleaning compositions and has as its stated 
objective provision of a composition which will clean and reveal soil on toilet seats. 
However, the document does not teach how to achieve this objective. The Oguri compositions are stated to contain a component which is coloured on reaction 
with protein or lipids, so that the appearance of the colour is intended to indicate the 
presence of protein or lipid. Ninhydrin is given as an example of reagent that becomes 
coloured on reaction with protein. As stated in the document, ninhydrin turns reddish 
violet on reaction with amino acids. Ninhydrin does not react with proteins, but instead 
reacts with amino acids. As ninhydrin does not bind to or react with protein, the reagent 
is not an effective indicator of the presence of protein.  
 In the Oguri Examples, experiments were performed using a glass plate onto which the 
palm of a hand had been pressed. Ninhydrin reacts with amino acids and ammonia 
components present in sweat from palm, and not protein, so that the development of the 
colour is indicative not of the presence of protein soil, but of palm sweat. The Oguri composition may include optional dyes such as Rose Bengal for an 
unspecified purpose, presumably to make the products look attractive. The Oguri compositions are described in general terms as including a surfactant for 
cleaning purposes, eg polyoxyethylene (30) cetyl ether, and optional solvent, eg ethyl 
alcohol. The detailed examples concern experiments with a range of different formulations, as 
specified in Tables 1 and 2. None of these formulations includes a dye such as Rose 
Bengal. Further, even assuming that ninhydrin is treated as the protein disclosing agent 
(which in
