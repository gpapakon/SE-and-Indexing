<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a method of determining the channel impulse response (CIR) of a communication system, such as the CIR of radio channels of a digital mobile radio network (GSM network). In particular, the present invention relates to determining the CIR based on the reception of a known training sequence. The present invention is based on the realisation that the resolution and dynamic range of the technique based on simple correlation can be improved by using a newly developed "line removal" technique. This involves taking the CIR as determined in the simple correlation, and producing a refined CIR in which the refined CIR is determined by locating the true path delay represented by the peaks resultant from the simple correlation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method of determining the channel
impulse response (CIR) of a communication system, such as the CIR of radio
channels of a digital mobile radio network (GSM network). In particular, the
present invention relates to determining the CIR based on the reception of a
known training sequence.Previously there exists solutions for estimating the CIR
of a communication system. One prior art solution for controlling
a RAKE receiver on the basis of measuring a path impulse response is
described in GB-2 286 509 A.In order to determine CIR, a portion of the transmit signal must be known.
For a GSM network, Synchronisation bursts (SB) are a useful portion of the
signal. The SB are transmitted on at least one channel from every base station,
and they are transmitted in a regular pattern. Decoding of the GSM protocols is
not necessary. Both the data in the SB and the pattern with which they occur is
fixed and substantially identical for all base stations.The advantage of using SB for determining the CIR is that they represent
a relatively long, noise-like predetermined transmitted signal. Typically, 64 bits
are transmitted over a period of 237µsec. The determination of the CIR thus
requires sufficient synchronisation to the bursts in the received signal to enable
the extraction of the SB which is then processed to determine the CIR.The CIR is determined by using estimation techniques. In order to
estimate the CIR, a known training sequence is transmitted Stx(t), and this is
corrupted by a communications channel producing the received signal Srx(t).
The problem in estimating the CIR is to determine tap-weights {α} of a FIR filter
(which is used to approximate the CIR), so that the known Stx(t) after passing
through the filter is as close as possible to the received signal Srx(t).Given the that the transmitted Signal Stx(t) and the received signal Srx(t)
is known, the CIR can be estimated from:
1. known samples of the transmitted signal Tk = Stx (t0 + kτ), - Nc ≤ k <
N (note that N + Nc samples represent the whole training sequence, the
numbering has been arranged to start from the known clean samples of the
received signal which occur Nc samples after the start of the training sequence.), 
and2. measured samples of the received signal Rk = Srx (to + kτ), 0 ≤
k < N (the first Nc samples of the training sequence are assumed corrupted and
are ignored).The tap weights {αk} are determined by simple correlation as
This algorithm relies on the noise-like properties of the transmitted
