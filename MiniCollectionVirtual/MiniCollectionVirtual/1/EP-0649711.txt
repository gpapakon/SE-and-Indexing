A dry shaving apparatus with at least one 
short-hair cutter (K) disposed on a housing (1) and an 

actuating switch (30) for turning an electric drive 
mechanism on and off as well as for adjusting a switch 

slide (2) provided with a long-hair trimmer (L) by means 
of a transmission device (G), 
characterized in that
 the 
transmission device (G) is comprised of two pivotally 

mounted transmission elements (6, 7), that the first 
transmission element (6) is pivotally mounted on the actuating 

switch (30) and acted upon by a first spring element 
(16), that the second transmission element (7) which 

is provided with detent elements (24, 25, 26) and a control 
cam (12) is pivotally mounted on the housing (1), is 

coupled to the switch slide (2) through a control element 
(13) engaging the control cam (12) as well as a second 

spring element (19), and is actuatable by the first 
transmission element (6) through a further detent element 

(14) in such manner that by displacement of the actuating 
switch (30) the two transmission elements (6, 7) are 

relatively movable into successive detent positions, 
whereof a first detent position corresponds to an OFF position 

of the dry shaving apparatus and a last detent position 
involves relative coupling of the two transmission 

elements (6, 7), such that a further displacement of the 
actuating switch (30) causes a turning motion of the 

second transmission element and an adjustment of the 
switch slide through the control cam (12) and the control 

element (13). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 the transmission elements (6, 7) 
are configured as one-armed lever elements each and are 

adapted to be coupled to each other by means of the 
further detent element (14) capable of positive engagement 

with the detent elements (24, 25, 26). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 1 
or claim 2, 
characterized in that
 a pivot bearing (11) is 
provided at the one end of the second transmission element 

(7) and the control cam (12) at the opposite end 
thereof, and that a coupling element (20) is arranged between 

the pivot bearing (11) and the control cam (12). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in any one 
of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the detent 
elements (24, 25, 26) of the second transmission element 

(7) are provided on a detent arm (R) formed integrally 
with the second transmission element (7).  

 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 
4, 
characterized in that
 the coupling element (20) on the 
second transmission element (7) is provided on a line (S) 

connecting the control cam (12) and the pivot bearing 
(11) . 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 
5, 
characterized in that
 the control cam (12) is of an 
approximately triangular shape, its side walls (40, 41) 

on either side of the line (S) being of an arcuate configuration. 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 
6, 
characterized in that
 the arcuate shape of the side 
walls (40, 41) of the control cam (12) is determined by 

an approximately rectangular transmission of motive force 
(direction of arrow B) from the second transmission element 

(7) to the control element (13) of the switch slide 
(2) . 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in any one 
of the claims 3 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the second 
transmission element (7) is carried on a bearing pin (27) 

provided on the housing (1) by means of the pivot bearing 
(11). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in any one 
of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the first 
transmission element (6) provides a first pivot bearing 

element (8), the further detent element (14), and a further 
coupling element (17) adapted to be acted upon by 

the first spring element (16). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 
9, 
characterized in that
 the actuating switch (30) provides 
a second pivot bearing element (9) cooperating with 

the first the pivot bearing element (8), as well as a 
bearing support (18) for the first spring element (16). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in any one 
of the claims 9 and 10, 
characterized in that
 the transmission 
element (6) is carried, by means of the pivot 

bearing elements (8, 9), on the actuating switch (30) on 
a transversely extending arm (36) of a coulisse structure 

(3) approximately on the vertical center axis (V). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in any one 
of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the actuating 
switch (30) is comprised of an actuating element 

(31) and/or the coulisse structure (3) coupled to the 
actuating element (31).  

 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 
12, 
characterized in that
 the actuating element (31) is 
coupled to the coulisse structure (3) by means of a clip 

connection (33, 34). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in any one 
of the claims 12 and 13, 
characterized in that
 the switch 
slide (2) is provided between the actuating element (31) 

and the coulisse structure (3). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in claim 
14, 
characterized in that
 the switch slide (2) incorporates 
at least one guide slot (4) for coupling the actuating 

element (31) to the coulisse structure (3). 
The dry shaving apparatus as claimed in any one 
of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the first 
spring element (16) and the second spring element (19) 

ensure a clearance-free support of the actuating switch 
(30), the switch slide (2), the first transmission element 

(6) and the second transmission element (7).
