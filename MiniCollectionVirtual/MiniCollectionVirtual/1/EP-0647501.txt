<ABSTRACT>
A tool for fitting a flange finisher (5) or door seal onto 
a flange (6) comprises a frame (20) having a top plate 

(22) carrying a support (50) contacting the outside of the 
base of the flange finisher (5). A depending leg (24) 

supports a reciprocating pneumatic motor (34) carrying an 
impact member (44) which is reciprocatable into and out of 

contact with the side wall (5B) of the flange finisher. A 
depending leg (26) carries a reaction member (32) in 

contact with the other side wall (5A). The flange 
finisher is initially fitted over the flange (6) with its 

side walls (5A,5B) splayed apart. When the motor (34) is 
energised, the impact member (44) applies repeated impacts 

to the flange finisher (5) so that its side walls (5A,5B) 
are pressed into gripping contact with the flange (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a tool for fitting a 
channel-shaped strip into embracing grip on a mount, 
comprising a support, reciprocatable means reciprocatably 
mounted with respect to the support and motor means 
connected to the reciprocatable means and mounted on the 
support and energisable to reciprocate the reciprocatable 
means with successive forward and retraction strokes 
whereby each forward stroke applies an impact force to the 
strip to force it on to the mount as the tool is moved 
along the strip. An example of such a known tool is shown in EP-A-0 451 
023. In this known tool, the reciprocatable means 
comprises a grooved head which engages the outside of the 
base of the channel of the strip and applies hammer blows 
to the base to force the strip onto the mount. The 
invention aims to provide a tool which improves the grip 
of the strip on the mount. In accordance with the invention, therefore, the known 
tool is characterised in that at least one of the side 
walls of the strip is initially splayed outwardly and in 
that the support includes mounting means for mounting the  
 
reciprocatable means adjacent the outside of a first one 
of the side walls of the strip whereby each forward stroke 
of the reciprocatable means applies the said impact force 
to the outside of the first side wall whereby to move the 
side walls of the strip relatively towards each other and 
into firm embracing contact with the mount. Tools embodying the invention for fitting flange finishers 
and door seals to motor vehicle bodies, and methods 
according to the invention for fitting flange finishers 
and door seals to such bodies, will now be described, by 
way of example only, with reference to the accompanying 
diagrammatic drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is an end view of a flange finisher fitted onto a 
flange around a door opening; Figure 2 corresponds to Figure 1 but shows a door seal 
instead of merely a flange finisher; Figure 3 shows the flange finisher of Figure 1 in an 
initial configuration before it is fitted onto the flange; Figure 4 shows the flange finisher of Figure 3 being 
offered up to the flange;  Figure 5 shows the door seal of Figure 2 in an initial 
configuration being offered up to the flange; Figure 6 is a side view of one of the tools showing it 
mounted in an initial position over a flange finisher on a 
door flange; Figure 7 corresponds to Figure 6 but shows the tool in 
operation; Figure 8 is a perspective view of the tool of Figures 6 
and 7; Figure 9 corresponds to Figure 6 and

with respect to the support (20,24) and motor means (34) 

connected to the reciprocatable means (44) and mounted on 
the support (20,24) and energisable to reciprocate the 

reciprocatable means (44) with successive forward and 
retraction strokes whereby each forward stroke applies an 

impact force to the strip (5) to force it on to the mount 
as the tool is moved along the strip (5), characterised in 

that at least one of the side walls (5A,5B) of the strip 
(5) is initially splayed outwardly and in that the support 

includes mounting means (24) for mounting the 
reciprocatable means (44) adjacent the outside of a first 

one (e.g. 5B) of the side walls (5A,5B) of the strip (5) 
whereby each forward stroke of the reciprocatable means 

(44) applies the said impact force to the outside of the 
first side wall (5B) whereby to move the side walls 

(5A,5B) of the strip (5) relatively towards each other and 
into firm embracing contact with the mount (6). 
A tool according to claim 1, characterised by reaction 
 

means (32) carried by the support (20) and adapted to be 
positioned adjacent the outside of the second one (5A) of 

the side walls of the strip (5) to apply a reaction force 
thereto in response to each impact force. 
A tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by 
guiding means (28,50) carried by the support (20) for 

contacting the outside of the base of the strip (5). 
A tool according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
guiding means comprises a rotatable member (28). 
A tool according to any preceding claim, characterised 
in that the motor means comprises a reciprocating 

pneumatic motor (34). 
A tool according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
support comprises a generally U-shaped frame (20,24,26) 

for embracing the strip (5) on the mount (6), the frame 
having a top plate (22) with two leg members (24,26) 

depending in spaced apart substantially parallel 
configuration, one leg member (24) mounting the 

reciprocatable means (44), the top plate (22) carrying 
guiding means (28,50) for contacting the outside of the 

base of the strip (5), and the other leg member (26) 
carrying reaction means (3
2) positioned to engage the 
 

outside of the second one (5A) of the side walls of the
