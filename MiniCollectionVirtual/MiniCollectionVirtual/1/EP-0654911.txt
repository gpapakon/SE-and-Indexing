<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit used in Time Division Multiple Access
radio phone systems for implementing a keyed switch-mode power supply.In Time Division Multiple Access radio phone systems, the transmitter is on only
part of the time, as for instance in the GSM system (Groupe Special Mobile)
about one eighth of the time. Due to the internal resistance of the storage
batteries variations in the operating voltage are created at the rate of the keying
of the transmission. This causes disturbances in the functions of the transmitter
and the receiver. Remedies to the situation can be made by coupling a large-size
capacitor in parallel with the storage batteries.The operating voltage variation caused by the charge state of the storage
battery and the compatibility between various types of storage batteries also set
limitations to the design and to the energy economy of a device. One known
manner to reduce said problems is to use a switch type power source, i.e. a so-called
Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) between the storage battery and
the electronics.A plurality of methods are known in generating a supply voltage with the aid of
switching circuits. Such designs are useful in continuously power consuming
products.The prior art technology is described below referring to the accompanying Figure
1 which presents a circuit known in the art for generating the operating voltage
with the aid of a switching circuit. Various switch mode power supplies known
in the art are described for example in reference "Advanced Linear European
Seminars for Precision Design of the 90's", published by Texas Instruments UK, 
Fig. 1 presents a power source 1 supplying direct current to an SMPS 2. An SMPS
includes an inductor to which the power is supplied via a switch. When the switched is
opened a peak voltage is created by the inductor that charges a capacitor also within
the SMPS. The capacitor smooths the output voltage.Problems are caused by the peak voltages created in the SMPS when the switches
therein are switched on and off with the current on. By an a-fold increase of the voltage
of the storage battery, the current to be supplied by the storage battery increases a-fold
relative to the current to the load. Also the power losses will increase.In radio phones the above design has not, however, been used in general, primarily due
to the electromagnetic interferences it causes, but also because of space constraints,
and inefficiency. For high efficiency, the switching times of the power source need to
be short,
