<ABSTRACT>
The classifier device disclosed herein analyzes message 
headers of the type which comprise a sequence of bit groups 

presented successively. The device employs a read/write memory 
for storing at a multiplicity of addresses, an alterable parse 

graph of instructions. The parse graph instructions include node 
instructions which comprise opcodes in association with 

respective next address characterizing data and terminator 
instructions which comprise identifying data for previously 

characterized header types. A logical processor responds to a 
node instruction read from memory either by initiating another 

memory read at a next address which, given the current state of 
the processor, is determinable from the current node instruction 

and the current header bit group or by outputting data indicating 
recognition failure if no next address is determinable. The 

logical processor responds to a terminator instruction by 
outputting respective header identifying data. Accordingly, for 

a previously characterized header type, a corresponding pattern 
of node instruction and a terminator instruction can be written 

into memory thereby enabling the device to identify the 
respective header type in a time which is essentially 

proportional to the length of the header and thus also to the 
time of presentation of the header. The parse graph can be 

updated dynamically during the operation of the classifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to packet switched 
message handling systems and, more particularly, to a device for 
quickly classifying previously characterized message headers. There is increasing interest in providing communications 
between disparate computer systems and even between networks of 
differing characteristics. Further, with the availability of 
very high bandwidth trunk lines, e.g., using fiber optic cables, 
there is increasing interest in combining traffic from a great 
variety of sources for transmission through a single trunk line. 
For wide area networks, packet switching technology is widely 
used where information to be transmitted is broken into packets 
of data which are proceeded by headers containing information 
useful in routing. The header may also identify the source and 
the destination. Whether truly packet switched or not, most 
digital communication systems employ message formats in which 
there is an identifying header of some sort. For large and complex networks, one standard which is being 
adopted is that of an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch 
which operates to transfer data cells of standard characteristics 
between links in a network. Within an ATM network, routing is 
typically provided by setting up a path between a source and 
destination and then including, in the headers for the  
 
standardized cells or packets, data which identifies that path to 
the various switches along the route. However, at various 
points, a relatively standardized ATM network must interface with 
disparate systems and convert the message formats of the 
disparate systems into the standard ATM cell format. A typical 
situation where this type of interfacing is necessary is at a so-called 
bridge where a ATM network interfaces with a local area 
network, e.g., an ethernet or a token ring network. The job of 
the bridge is essentially to examine all of the traffic on the 
local area network and, if the destination of a given packet is 
across the ATM network, i.e., outside the respective local area 
network, the bridge transfers that message into the ATM network. 
This process is often referred to as forwarding. Heretofore, the analysis of message headers to determine 
appropriate action has been provided by writing a conventional 
computer program to run on a high speed, but essentially 
conventional, general purpose processor. The program operates to 
dissect and test the components of the message header and thereby 
determine its content. If such a generalized
