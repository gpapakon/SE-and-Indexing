<ABSTRACT>
A double-sided miter box, which may be fastened for example on the rolling truck of a panel saw, has two stop rails which can swivel around an axis of rotation. A measurement value generator for determining the swivelling position consists of a magnetically coded measurement ribbon arranged between the stop rails around the axis of rotation along a graduated circle, of a fixed sensor which contactlessly scans the measurement ribbon and of a display for the measurement values.

Double-sided mitre box for machine tools, in particular 
panel saws, with 


two movable stop rails (2, 4) disposed at one end relative 
to the driven tool (14), 
which stop rails, enclosing a right angle between 
themselves, are connected together, 
the stop rails (2, 4) being mounted to pivot in common about 
an axis of rotation (16), 
and means being provided for determining the pivot angle,
 
characterised in that 
the axis of rotation (16) is disposed at a lateral distance 
from the tool (14) on the bisecting line of the angle of the 

stop rails (2, 4), 
an electrical measurement-value emitter for determining the 
pivot angle of the stop rails (2, 4) with respect to a tool 

plane (12), and 
a display (10) for indicating the pivot angle are provided,
 
the electrical measurement-value emitter comprising a 

magnetically-coded measurement strip (18), which is disposed  
 

along a reference circle about the axis of rotation (16), 
and
 
further comprising a sensor (20) scanning the measurement 

strip (18) in a non-contacting manner,
 
whose measurement value is indicated on the display (10) as 

an angular measurement of the pivot angle. 
Mitre box according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the magnetically-coded measurement 

strip (18) is attached to a vertically-extending surface 
along th
e reference circle relative to a plane mounted 
between the stop rails (2, 4). 
Mitre box according to claim 1 and/or 2, with a 
projection (8) of the mitre box which is non-pivotable with 

reference to the tool plane (12),
 
characterised in that the display (10) and the sensor (20) 

scanning the measurement strip (18) are disposed at one end 
of the projection (8).  

 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, with at least one stop flap which is longitudinally 

displaceably but securably mounted on a stop rail (2, 4),
 
characterised in that attached to one stop flap is a sensor 

which scans in a non-contacting manner a measurement strip 
attached along a stop rail (2, 4), and from which an 

electrical connection exists to the display (10), upon which 
the relative position of the stop flap to the stop rail (2, 

4) may be indicated. 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that a length value derived from the 

measurement strip of the stop rail is corrected in a 
computer (44) by the angular measurement derived from the 

measurement strip (18) disposed along the reference circle, 
in such a way that the display (10) indicates the actual 

distance of the stop flap from the tool (14).  
 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that each stop flap is movable on the stop 

rail (2, 4) with the aid of an electrical stepping motor. 
Mitre box according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that a value of the distance of the stop 

flap from the tool (14), which may be input into the 
computer (44), is processed by the angular measurement 

derived from the sensor (20) disposed along the reference 
circle in the computer (44), and the latter passes a signal 

to the stepping motor so that the stop flap, in every 
pivoted position of the stop rails (2, 4), is shifted to 

the input value of the distance of the stop flaps from the 
tool (14). 
Mitre box according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that there is disposed on the display (10) 

a numerical keyboard by means of which the value of the 
distance of the stop flap from the tool (14) may be manually 

input into the computer (44).  
 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that there is disposed between the stop 

rails (2, 4) a quadrant plate (6) securely attached to said 
stop rails. 
Mitre box according to claim 9,
 
characterised by a manually-operable friction wheel (38) 

which is mounted on the projection (8) which is non-pivotable 
relative to the tool plane, and which is in 

engagement with a portion of the quadrant plate (6), so that 
the pivot angle of the stop rails (2, 4) may be precisely 

adjusted by rotation of the friction wheel (38). 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that the stop rails (2, 4) can be secured 

in any selected pivot angle with the aid of clamping means.  
 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that the computer (44) and the display (10) 

are accommodated in a common housing (42). 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that the electrical and electronic 

components of the mitre box are supplied with current from a 
battery. 
Mitre box according to at least one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in that the display (10) may be switched from 

angular to length measurements.
