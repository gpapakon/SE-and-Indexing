<ABSTRACT>
A communication apparatus which is connected 
to a telephone line together with a telephone comprises 

a connection unit to connect the telephone, a detect 
unit to detect a connecting state of the telephone, 

and a connection unit to selectively connect a load 
such as call signal detector or terminal circuit to 

the telephone line in accordance with the detection by 
the detect unit. The detect unit detects an off hook 

of the telephone or detects whether the telephone is 
connected to the connection unit or not.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a communication 
apparatus which is connected to a line together with a 
telephone. Hitherto, in case of generating a call by a 
pulse dial from a telephone connected to a facsimile 
apparatus, a pulse waveform passes through the inside 
of the facsimile apparatus and passes in a telephone 
line and is transmitted to a switchboard. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a 
construction of a peripheral circuit of a network 
control section in the conventional facsimile apparatus. 
Only the items regarding the conventional subject will 
now be described here. As shown in the diagram, a CI detection circuit 
51 to detect a CI signal is provided in the facsimile 
apparatus. In case of providing the CI detection circuit 51 
as shown in Fig. 5, however, there is a drawback such 
that a pulse waveform is deformed because the CI 
detection circuit 51 is connected in parallel to the 
telephone line in which the pulse waveform passes. That 
is, in Fig. 5, a capacitor C and a resistor R for  
 
providing an impedance in an on hook state are provided 
to the facsimile apparatus. The capacitor C and 
resistor R are connected in series to the CI detection 
circuit 51 and act on the pulse waveform. In the conventional facsimile apparatus, 
therefore, there is a fear such that a dial signal is 
erroneously judged in the switchboard due to a waveform 
distortion of the pulse dial. It is an object of the invention to provide a 
communication apparatus of a high reliability. Another object of the invention is to prevent an 
erroneous operation of a switchboard. Still another object of the invention is to 
prevent a deformation of a waveform of a dial pulse. The above and other objects and features of the 
present invention will become apparent from the following 
detailed description and the appended claims with 
reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the first 
embodiment of the invention; Fig. 2 is a circuit diagram showing a peripheral 
circuit of a network control section in the first 
embodiment;  Fig. 3 is a time chart showing control signals 
from a CPU for a series of operations of an H relay in 
the first embodiment; Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram showing a peripheral 
circuit of a network control section in the second 
embodiment of the invention; Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram showing a peripheral 
circuit of a network control section in a conventional 
apparatus; Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing a peripheral 
circuit of a network control section in the third
