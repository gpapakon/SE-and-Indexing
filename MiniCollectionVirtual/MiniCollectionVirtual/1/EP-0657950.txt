<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a lead-provided porous metal sheet comprises 
the steps of: forming a porous metal material having a metal layer on a surface 

of a framework of a porous base material comprising a foamed sheet or the 
like, by plating (#4) the porous base material and/or applying fine metal 

powders thereto; passing the porous metal material through a pair of rolls 
having a plurality of projections to compress the porous metal material 

against the projections and reduce or eliminate pores so as to form one or 
more recesses (#3); and forming solid metal portions by applying fine metal 

powders to the entire recesses (#5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lead-provided
porous metal sheet and a method for manufacturing the same,
and more particularly, to a lead-provided porous metal
sheet preferably used as a spiral type electrode plate of
a battery. In order to use, as a spiral type electrode
plate, a porous metal sheet formed by using a combination
of porous sheets such as a foamed sheet, a piece of
nonwoven cloth, and a mesh sheet or only one of these three
types of sheets, an active substance is charged into pores of the
porous metal sheet. In this manner, leads consisting of
continuous solid metal serving as a collection element for
collecting electric current are formed along the peripheral
edge of the spiral type electrode.In the case of a cylindrical battery having the
spiral type electrode plate, the porous metal sheet is used
as the core of both positive and negative electrode plate.
The band-shaped positive and negative electrode plates
formed by charging the active substance into pores of the
porous metal sheet are spirally wound, with a separator
interposed therebetween.In order for the battery having the spiral type
electrode plate to collect electric current, one end of
a collection terminal is connected with a portion of the 
positive and negative electrode plates by spot welding,
respectively and the other end of the collection terminal
welded to the positive electrode plate is welded to a
sealing portion, provided with a cap, serving as a positive
terminal, and other end of the collection terminal welded
to the negative electrode plate is welded to the inner
bottom surface of the metal casing of the battery.In the case where each collection terminal is
connected with each electrode plate at one point thereof by
spot welding, the distance between the point at which
electric current has been generated in the electrode and
each collection terminal is long and further, collected
electric current is flowed only through one collection
terminal. Consequently, the internal resistance of the
battery is great.Because the rigidity of the porous metal sheet
becomes very high when the active substance is charged into
pores thereof, there is a high possibility that the porous
metal sheet is broken when it is wound spirally. If the
lead is not broken, electric current can be collected
effectively, while if the lead is broken, the porous metal
sheet cannot function.Thus, as shown in Fig. 13, a battery of
multipoint collection type is proposed: A positive electrode
plate 1 and a negative electrode plate 2 are spirally
wo
