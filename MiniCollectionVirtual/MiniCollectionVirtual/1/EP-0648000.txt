<ABSTRACT>
An underfloor equipment box for floors which are to be cleaned wet. Such an underfloor equipment box is known having a component which is designed as a cord outlet, is provided centrally in a cover of a protective frame and is bonded tightly in the cover, such that it projects from a top of the cover in the operation position, a circumferential seal being provided between the cover and the protective frame. According to the invention, the cover (2) is arranged on the protective frame (1) such that it can pivot and has a locking device (13 to 19; 38 to 41; 42 to 50) which holds the cover (2) in the locked position, pressed against the circumferential seal (5).

An underfloor equipment container for floors requiring wet cleaning, 
with a component (3) constructed as a cord outlet which is provided centrally in 

a cover (2) of a protective frame (1) and which, in the operative position, is tightly 
integrated into the cover to project from the top thereof, whereby there is an 

encircling gasket (5) between the cover and the protective frame, characterised in 
that the cover (2) is pivotally disposed on the protective frame (1) and comprises 

an interlocking arrangement (13 to 19; 38 to 41; 42 to 50) which maintains the 
cover (2) pressed against the encircling gasket (5) when in the locked position. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the interlocking arrangement comprises, associated with the cover (2), an 

actuating element (14; 38, 42) for releasing a self-resetting locking mechanism. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the interlocking means comprises, movably mounted on the cover (2), a 

catch handle (14) adapted to be locked together with a mating member (18) on the 
protective frame. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the catch handle (14) comprises a restoring spring (16). 
An underfloor equipment container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the container (3) which is constructed as a cord outlet 

within the cover (2) is adapted for movement between a recessed inoperative 
position in which it is flush with the top of the cover and the operative position 

and in that sealing elements (23, 24) are provided between the cover (2) and the  
 

component (3) both for the inoperative and also for the operative positions, and 
in that means (26, 27, 28) are provided to secure the component (3) in the 

inoperative and operative positions respectively. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 5, characterised 
in that the component is constructed as a tubular hollow body (3) disposed in an 

aperture in the cover (2). 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 6, characterised 
in that a first encircling gasket (24) is provided between the hollow body (3) and 

the aperture in the cover (2) for the depressed inoperative position of the hollow 
body (3) and a second encircling gasket (23) is provided for the operative position 

of the hollow body (3). 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 7, characterised 
in that the outer walls of the hollow body (3) are provided with at least one sliding 

block guide (25, 26, 28) for controlled movement of the hollow body (3) in the 
aperture between the inoperative and operative positions and with which at least 

one guide cam (27) is associated in the region of one edge of the said aperture. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 8, characterised 
in that the at least one sliding block guide comprises a peripherally extending first 

locking groove portion (26), and then, related to the longitudinal axis (34) of the 
hollow body (3), an axial displacement groove portion (25) and adjacent thereto 

a second locking groove portion (28) parallel with the first locking groove portion 
(26).  

 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 9, characterised 
in that at least one guide cam (27) can be locked in the two locking groove 

portions (26, 28). 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the hollow body (3) can be secured by a bayonet-type locking 

arrangement in the region of the two locking groove portions (26, 28). 
An underfloor equipment container according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the part (20) of the hollow body (3) is constructed as 

a pivotable 
cover which can be locked on the other part (21) of the hollow body (3) by means 

of a catch connection. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 12, 
characterised in that the pivotable cover (20, 20a) is provided with a cord outlet 

orifice. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 13, 
characterised in that a splash protective edge (32) is provided in the region of the 

cord outlet orifice. 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 13 or 14, 
characterised in that the cord outlet orifice can be sealed by means of a dustproof 

seal (29). 
An underfloor equipment container according to claim 1, characterised 
in that a plurality of support studs (6) of a synthetic plastics material are provided  

 
between the cover (2) and the protective frame (1).
