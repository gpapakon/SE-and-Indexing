<ABSTRACT>
A method for the treatment of a stream of exhaust gases including phosphine, 
which comprises heating the stream to a sufficiently high temperature to 

decompose the phosphine to phosphorus vapour and passing the stream into a 
reactor containing calcium oxide heated above 100°C, the method also 

comprising passing oxygen and/or air in to the reactor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the purification of gas streams and more particularly, of
those gas streams which result from the production of semi-conductor devices
and which contain noxious substances, especially compounds of arsenic or
phosphorus.In our patent application WO 89/11905 we describe processes and apparatus
for the scrubbing of noxious substances from exhaust gases, particularly those
emanating from semi-conductor production chambers in which the noxious
substances may themselves be used either as the etching gases used in the
production or in the plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) on to
semi-conductor materials.The process described in our prior patent application comprise contacting the
exhaust gases with:
i) a silicon stage preferably having a purity of more than 90% and most
preferably more than 97%, for example a crystalline or polycrystalline
material with a purity of about 98.5%; the silicon may be mixed with
"inert" substances such as silica or alumina or with lime (CaO) or
magnesia (MgO) or even be alloyed with one or more of the metals
ehromium, manganese iron, cobalt or nickel, for example in the form of
ferrosilicon or manganese-silicon or possibly silicon carbide.
An addition of copper (or a copper rich material) to the silicon stage may
be beneficial.ii) a calcium oxide stage in which the calcium oxide may be in the form of
calcium oxide itself, lime, soda lime (calcium hydroxide with sodium
hydroxide or potassium hydroxide), any form of which may also contain
"inert" materials such as graphite (or coke), limestone (CaCO3), magnesia
MgCO3 or slaked lime (Ca(OH)2). Overall this stage can be represented as
a calcium oxide or a calcium oxide compound or a calcium oxide
containing material or a soda lime containing medium. iii) an optional stage in which the active ingredient is a copper oxide (CuO or
Cu2O) which may be present on calcium silicate supporting medium or on
a calcium oxide/calcium silicate supporting medium.The processes are operated at elevated temperatures. In particular:
i) the silicon stage is heated above 200°C and preferably maintained
between 350 and 500°Cii) the calcium oxide stage is heated above 100°C and preferably maintained
between 250 and 550°Ciii) the copper oxide stage is maintained between 150 and 600°C, preferably
between 200 and 400°C.These different stages may conveniently be placed in apparatus comprising a
single cylindrical tube, and with the stages spaces apart within the tube, about
which are positioned a plurality of heating
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for the treatment of a stream of exhaust gases including
phosphine, which comprises passing the stream in to a reactor comprising

a first stage (2) being a surface or bed of silicon heated above 200°C and
a second stage (3) containing calcium oxide heated above 100°C, whereby

the phosphine is decomposed in the first stage (2) to
phosphorus vapour and oxygen and/or air is introduced in to the

stream in the second stage (3) of the reactor to enhance the formation of
calcium phosphate therein.
A method according Claim 1 in which the surface or bed of silicon is
heated above 350°C.
A method according to Claim 2 in which the surface or bed of silicon is
heated above 500°C.
A method according to any preceding claim in which the calcium oxide is
heated above 350°C.
A method according to Claim 4 in which the calcium oxide is heated
above 500°C.
A method according to any preceding claim in which the exhaust gas
stream contains both arsine and phosphine
 and in which the stream is
heated sufficiently to decompose the arsine and phosphine to arsenic and

phosphorus vapours respectively.
A method according to Claim 6 in which condenser means are provided
prior to the introduction of oxygen and/or air in to the reactor at a

temperature to condense the arsenic vapour but not the phosphorus
vapour.
A method according to Claim 7 in which the condensing temperature is
about 100°C.
