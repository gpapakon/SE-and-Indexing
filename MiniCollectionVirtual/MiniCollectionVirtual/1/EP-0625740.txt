<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an amplifying 
system for solenoid controlled proportion valve used in a 
hydraulic system, and more particularly to an intelligent 
amplifying system having a fault diagnosis function and a 
protective function in the hydraulic system. One such system is disclosed in US-A-5 172 311. Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of a mechanism for 
controlling a conventional solenoid controlled proportion valve, 
in which an amplifying circuit 1 for the solenoid controlled 
proportion valve(hereinafter, referred to as "proportion 
valve")controls an operation of the proportion valve in 
response to operating signals provided from operating 
members such as an electric joystick 2, an electric pedal 3, 
and an external controller 4 having a function similar to those  
 
of the members 2 and 3. When an electric current is transmitted from the amplifying 
circuit 1, to the proportion valve 5, a spool(not shown)in the 
proportion valve 5 moves in response to the transmitted 
amount of an electric current. Accordingly, an oil pressure(or a 
flow amount)can be controlled by a displacement of the spool. Fig. 2 illustrates a conventional analog amplifying circuit. Referring to Fig. 2, the operating signal provided from 
operating members(see reference numerals 2, 3 and 4 shown in 
Fig. 1)is transmitted to the amplifying circuit 1 through an 
input terminal 31. The input signal is then transmitted to four 
limiters 36, 36a, 36b and 36c composed of Schmidt trigger 
circuit, respectively. The first trip point setting unit 32 determines the lower 
trip point which corresponds to 10% of the input signal 
amplitude. The limiters 36 and 36b operated by the first trip 
point setting unit 32 and inverters 35a, 35b, 35c put the first 
proportion valve 5 into an enable state and the second 
proportion valve 5a into a disable state when the input signal 
is above the first lower trip point. The function of limiters 36 and 36b, for example in 
hydraulic equipments, is accomplished in such a way that in 
its forward move the first proportion valve is put to enable 
state with the second proportion valve put to disable state, 
and in its backward move each valve is put to the opposite  
 
state, respectively. The upper trip point corresponding to 90% of the input 
signal is determined by the second trip point setting unit 32a. 
When the input signal is higher than the first upper trip 
point(90%) or lower than the second upper trip point(-90%), 
the range limiters 36a and 36c allow a maximum amount
