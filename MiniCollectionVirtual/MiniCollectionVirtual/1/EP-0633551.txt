<ABSTRACT>
Method for the fast and secure transmission of data contained in an IC card (5) during a teletransaction between a mobile apparatus (4) including an IC card reader (6) and a fixed set (1), the said card reader (6) including a fast memory (7), characterised in that upon introducing the card into the said reader, the reader stores in the said fast memory (7), apart from the data of the card, a pair of data, one of which identifies the number of the card and the other of which corresponds to a serial number for access to the card, each access, by any reader, incrementing this number by one unit in the card and in that, during the transaction, the mobile apparatus (4), remotely interrogated by the fixed set (1), compares the said pair of data stored in the said fast memory (7) of the said reader (6) with the pair of data from the card currently slotted into the mobile apparatus (4) and transmits the result of the comparison and the card's data stored in the fast memory (7) to the fixed set (1).

A method of transmitting data quickly and securely from a smart card
(5) during a remote transaction between a fixed station (1) and a

mobile item of equipment (4) containing a smart-card reader (6), said
card reader (6) having a fast memory (7), said method being

characterized in that, on receiving said card, and in addition to
storing the data from the card in said fast memory (7), said reader

also stores a pair of data items in said fast memory, one of which
data items identifies the number of the card, and the other data item

corresponds to an access count indicating the number of accesses to
the card, each access by any reader incrementing the access count in

the card by unity, and in that, during the transaction, the mobile
item of equipment (4), which is interrogated remotely by the fixed

station (1), compares said pair of data items stored in said fast
memory (7) 
of said reader (6) with the pair of data items of the card
that is currently inserted in the mobile item of equipment (4), and

transmits the result of the comparison and the data of the card,
which data is stored in the fast memory (7), to the fixed station

(1).
