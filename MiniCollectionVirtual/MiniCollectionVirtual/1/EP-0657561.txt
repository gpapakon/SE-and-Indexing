<ABSTRACT>
An alloyed hot-dip iron-zinc-alloy plated steel plate having an excellent press moldibility and a plurality of 
fine recesses satisfying the following conditions: (1) the number of fine recesses having a depth of not less than 2 

µm is within the range of 200-8,200/mm² per 1 mm² of the plated layer; and (2) a total of the areas of the openings 
per unit area of these recesses in the plated layer accounts for 10-70 % of the same unit area. The plated steel plate 

mentioned above is manufactured by subjecting a cold rolled steel plate to zinc hot dipping in which a temperature 
region, in which an initial reaction temperature for the formation of an iron-aluminium alloy layer is generated, in 

a zinc hot dipping bath having 0.05-0.30 wt.% aluminium content is limited to 500 °-600 °C, alloying in which an 
alloying temperature is limited to 480 °-600 °C, and temper rolling. When the above-mentioned condition (2) is 

replaced by the condition that a relative load length tp (2 µm) in a profile curve is in the range of 30-90 %, excellent 
painting sharpness can be given to the plated steel plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an alloying-treated
iron-zinc alloy dip-plated steel sheet excellent
in press-formability.Alloying-treated iron-zinc alloy dip-plated steel
sheets and zinciferous electroplated steel sheets have
conventionally been used as outer shells for an
automobile body, a home electric appliance and furniture.
Recently, however, the alloying-treated iron-zinc dip-plated
steel sheet is attracting greater general attention
than the zinciferous electroplated steel sheet for the
following reasons:
(1) The zinciferous electroplated steel sheet having a
relatively small plating weight, manufactured usually
by subjecting a cold-rolled steel sheet having an
adjusted surface roughness to a zinc electroplating
treatment, is preferably employed as a steel sheet
required to be excellent in finish appearance after
painting and in corrosion resistance such as a steel 
sheet for an automobile body;(2) However, the steel sheet for an automobile body is
required to exhibit a further excellent corrosion
resistance;(3) In order to impart a further excellent corrosion
resistance to the above-mentioned zinciferous electroplated
steel sheet, it is necessary to increase a
plating weight thereof, and the plating weight thus
increased leads to a higher manufacturing cost of the
zinciferous electroplated steel sheet; and(4) On the other hand, the alloying-treated iron-zinc
alloy dip-plated steel sheet is excellent in electro-paintability,
weldability and corrosion resistance,
and furthermore, it is relatively easy to increase a
plating weight thereof.However, in the above-mentioned conventional
alloying-treated iron-zinc alloy dip-plated steel sheet,
the difference in an iron content between the surface
portion and the inner portion of the alloying-treated
iron-zinc alloy dip-plating layer becomes larger according
as the plating weight increases, because the alloying
treatment is accomplished through the thermal diffusion.
More specifically, a Γ-phase having a high iron content
tends to be easily produced on the interface between the 
alloying-treated iron-zinc alloy dip-plating layer and
the steel sheet, and a ζ-phase having a low iron content
is easily produced, on the other hand, in the surface
portion of the alloying-treated iron-zinc alloy dip-plating
layer. The Γ-phase is more brittle as compared
with the ζ-phase. In the alloying-treated iron-zinc
alloy dip-plating layer which has a structure comprising
the Γ-phase and a structure comprising the ζ-phase, a
high amount of the Γ-phase results in
