<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a device (1) for a machine (2) for handling of sausage (3) between a sausage feeder (4) and a delivering device (5) for sausage (3) to a package (6) with a conveyor (7, 18, 23) operating between the feeder (4) and the delivering device (5). According to the invention a number of flaps (8) are located above the conveyor (7) divided by carriers (10) into compartments (11). The flaps (8) are arranged to extend substantially in line (9) with passing carrier (10) and forming an extension of the same. The function of the flaps (8) is to act on sausage (3) to be directed in said compartment (11) before delivering of the sausage (3) to packing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a device for a machine for
handling of sausage between an sausage feeder and a delivering
apparatus for delivering sausages to a container, said
device comprising a conveyor acting between the feeder and
the delivering apparatus.Known machines that can transport and position sausage of
longish type, for instance so called hot dogs of various kind,
from a depository at a receiving location of a machine on a
conveyor intended for this to be transferred to packing of
the sausage has been complicated, staff demanding and not so
effective. The sausage thereby also might be damaged and
come into positions which has rendered the transport of the
same more difficult.An example of a device of the above kind as apparatus for
counting elongated articles such as straws, cigaretts and
toothpicks is described in US-A-4,183,192. The apparatus
comprises a first conveyor aligning the ends of straws with
one another using endless guide belts provided on either side
of the first conveyor. The prealigned straws are received by
a hopper depositing them on a second conveyor for conveying
the straws to a boxing apparatus. The belt of the second
conveyor is inclined upwardly towards the boxing apparatus
and provided with a plurality of transverse channels, which
are of suitable dimensions to receive a simple straw. Thus, an
optical scanning device is able to count and control the
apparatus. For depositing the straws on the second conveyor
rotating brushes are provided in the hopper. Sausages,
however, would be damaged by the brushes, which are therefore
unsuitable for use in sausage handling machines. EP 0 482 334 A1 discloses a conveyor device for automatically
packing pieces, especially assortments of sliced sausages
comprising a first section transporting filled receptacles towards
a packing device and an second section returning the
empty receptacles towards a filling station. Counting or group
forming means for collecting a certain number of pieces, e.g.
in a container, are not provided.The main object of the present invention is at first hand to
achieve a device, which solves the above mentioned problem of
complicated, staff demanding packing of sausages with simple
and well operating means, and by this among other things
make the handling of sausage more effective before packing of
the same, such as for instance to arrange, count and put in
order sausages with equal diameter in an appropriate compartment
of a conveyor and at a package intended package of
a packing machine, whereby among
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device (1) for a machine (2) for handling
sausages (3) between a sausage feeder (4) and a

delivering apparatus (5) for delivering
sausages (3) to a container (6), said device

(1) comprising a conveyor (7, 18, 23) acting
between the feeder (4) and the delivering

apparatus (5), 
characterized in
that a number of flaps (8) are located
above an upwards inclined sorting conveyor (7)

which is provided with a plurality of
transverse compartments (11) forming carrier

walls (10), said flaps (8) extending
substantially in line (9) with

and forming an extension of
passing

carrier walls (10), said flaps (8) being
arranged to orientate sausages (3) transversely

to the transport direction of the sorting
conveyor (7) in said compartment (11) before

delivering the sausages (3) to a container (6),
and
that a carrier conveyor (23), provided with
transverse walls (24) and sausage receiving

compartments (25) is adapted to cooperate with
a receiving station (50) operating beneath said

carrier conveyor (23) and being divided into
groups (29) corresponding to the container (6)

which receiving station (50) is movable for
delivering the sausages (3) received by said to

an allocated container compartment (30).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in
that the transverse sausage compartment 

dividing walls (24) of the carrier conveyor
(23) extend to an active height (X) below the

diameter (D) of a sausage (3), and that a
sausage depository (20) ends in the area above

said carrier conveyor (23).
A device according to claim 2, characterized in
that the receiving station (50) is movable

laterally (28) along a substantially horizontal
plane (15) before sausages (3) are dropped

below said receiving station (50).
A device according to claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that the receiving station

(50) which operates as a sinking unit and
preferably is provided with receiving spaces

corresponding to an intended container
compartment (30) situated below is provided

with a bottom (51) which can be opened.
A device according to claim 4, characterized in
that the sinking unit (50) is movable

laterally, preferably pivotally journalled (31)
between a receiving position (M) and a

delivering position.
A device according to claim 4, characterized in
that an intermediate conveyor (18) is provided

with an ascending end section (19) opening out
into a sausage depository (20).
A device according to any of the above claims
characterized in that the flaps (8) are

resilient, e.g. pivotally (13) journalled to be 
able to pivot from a first position in line

with said extending line (9) and upwards in the
direction (12) of transport.
A device according to claim 7, characterized in
that the flaps (8) are arranged above the

sorting conveyor (7) which is arranged so that
it ascends steeply upward, e.g. about 60Â°

versus the horizontal plane (15).
A device according to claim 8, characterized in
that the sorting conveyor (7) is ended by means

of an end section (17) situated above the
intermediate conveyor (18) and extending along

said intermediate conveyor (18).
