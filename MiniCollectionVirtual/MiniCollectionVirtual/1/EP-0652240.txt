<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
polymerization of conjugated diolefins and more
particularly to a polymerization process whereby a
polybutadiene having a high cis-1,4-content is produced
in the presence of a catalyst system based on a rare
earth metal carboxylate that exhibits high activity.The use of rare earth compounds as components of
organo-metallic mixed catalyst systems for the
stereospecific polymerization of 1,3-butadiene to afford
a polybutadiene with a high cis-1,4-structure has been
known for a long time. For example, U.S. Patent
4,260,707 discloses a catalyst that may be used for
polymerizing diene monomers in solution comprises (a) a
reaction mixture formed by reacting a rare earth
carboxylate and an aluminum compound wherein there are
three hydrocarbon residues having from 1 to 20 carbon
atoms attached to the aluminum, (b) a trialkyl aluminum
and/or a dialkyl aluminum hydride and (c) a Lewis acid.An improved process for preparing conjugated
diolefin polymers or copolymers having a high content of
1,4-cis-units and high chain linearity is disclosed in
U.S. Patent Number 4,444,903. In this process a
catalytic system prepared from (a) at least one
carboxylate or alcoholate of a rare earth element, (b) a
tertiary organic halide and (c) an organo metallic
aluminum compound not containing halide ions of the
formula: RaRbAlRc in which Ra and Rb are alkyl residues
and Rc is hydrogen or an alkyl radical.Another example of the use of an organometallic
mixed catalyst system containing a rare earth compound
for producing a conjugated diene polymer is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent Number 4,461,883. The process is
characterized by polymerizing at least one conjugated
diene with a catalyst consisting of (A) a reaction
product of a Lewis base and a carboxylate of a rare
earth element of the lanthanum series represented by
AlR2R3R4 wherein R2,R3, and R4 which may be identical or
different represent hydrogen or alkyl substituents,
although R2,R3, and R4 may not all be hydrogen at the
same time and (C) an alkyl aluminum halide represented
by AlXnR53-n wherein X is a halide, R5 is an alkyl group
and n has the value of 1, 1.5, 2 or 3 and (D) optionally
a conjugated diene.U.S. Patent Number 4,533,711 discloses that a
polybutadiene rubber composition comprising a
polybutadiene having a cis-1,4-content of at least 70
per cent, an average chain length of 110 to 450 cis-1,4-units,
