<ABSTRACT>
A remote controlled loudspeaker comprises a main housing, an 
explosion-proof body provided within the main housing and 

means for controlling the loudspeaker, the control means are 
located within the explosion-proof body such that in the event 

of an emergency the loudspeaker may continue to be operated 
from a remote location.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to loudspeakers and in 
particular provides loudspeakers for emergency public 
address in remote or hazardous areas such as on off-shore 
oil/gas platforms and drilling rigs. Loudspeakers are often used in hazardous areas to 
provide audible warnings as an integral part of the safety 
features of the area. In the event of any serious accidents 
or emergency procedures it is imperative that the work-force 
and any emergency teams can be given precise information 
regarding the incident and what steps must be taken such as 
decks to be cleared or, in the event of a serious fire, the 
procedure and route for the installation to be evacuated. 
In such circumstances it is imperative that the loudspeakers 
function for as long as possible in emergency conditions 
especially during fire as lives may be lost if such 
loudspeaker equipment is affected by a fire. At present, the control electronics for the public 
address speakers are generally located in a safe area on the 
installation and cables are run from this area to the 
speakers. The loudspeakers are then controlled from a 
remote location such as a radio room or control room. The present arrangement uses large amounts of cabling 
which is susceptible to damage during an emergency such as 
an explosion or fire on deck. EP-A-0180423 describes a system for remotely adjusting a 
parameter of an electrical circuit within an enclosure in which 
sensors are mounted on respective explosion proof housings 
containing microprocessor circuitry for operating signals from 
the sensors. The signals are transmitted to a central control 
unit. A remote hand held unit is provided for individually 
setting the operating parameters of the circuitry. The present invention therefore aims to overcome the 
disadvantages of known loudspeaker equipment and to provide 
a loudspeaker which will continue to function in hazardous 
conditions. According to one aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a remote controlled loudspeaker comprising a 
main housing; an explosion proof body located within the  
 
main housing; closure means for the body; means for sealing 
the closure means in position; an aperture in one end of the 
main housing through which the body extends; means for 
sealing the body within the aperture and means for 
controlling the loudspeaker, the control means being 
provided within the body such that in the event of an 
emergency the loudspeaker may continue to operate from a 
remote location. Sealing means are provided to seal the

<CLAIMS>
A remote controlled loudspeaker (1) comprising a main 
housing (2); an explosion proof body (8) located within the 

main housing; closure means (12) for the body; means (13) 
for sealing the closure means in position; an aperture (9) 

in one end of the main housing through which the body 
extends; means (10, 11, 17) for sealing the body within the 

aperture and means (16) for controlling the loudspeaker, the 
control means being provided within the body such that in 

the event of an emergency the loudspeaker may continue to 
operate from a remote location. 
A remote controlled loudspeaker according to claim 1, 
wherein sealing means are pro
vided to seal the explosion-proof 
body within the loudspeaker housing. 
A remote controlled loudspeaker according to claim 2, 
wherein the sealing means comprises a plurality of silicone-rubber 

o-rings and a sintered disc. 
A remote controlled loudspeaker according to any one of 
claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein power is supplied via an 

uninterrupted power supply from the installation source.

the preceding claims, wherein the control means comprises an 

RF unit, a processor unit, a decoder, the decoder being set 
for detection of one of a number of signals, and an 

amplifier for amplifying the signal. 
A remote controlled loudspeaker according to claim 5, 
wherein the control means further comprises a filter and a 

mute circuit ensuring no unwanted noise is fed to the 
amplifier. 
A remote controlled loudspeaker according to claim 6,  
 

wherein the control means further comprises a volume control 
unit, a decoder and means for checking the validity and 

identity of a signal. 
A remote controlled loudspeaker according to claim 7, 
wherein the means for checking the validity and identity of 

the signal comprises a micro controller.
