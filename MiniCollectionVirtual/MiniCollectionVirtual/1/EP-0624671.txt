<ABSTRACT>
The thread retainer consists of two retaining members (1, 2) which are arranged relative to one another in such a way that a gap (21) having a curved cross-sectional shape and with a width continuously uniform in the direction of action and a continuously increasing cross-sectional contour is formed. As a result of the one-sided mounting, the retaining members (1, 2) acting as levers form a gap which is rectilinear in the direction of action. Retention of a weft thread is brought about by a partial looping of one of the retaining members and the surface friction occurring thereby, with the result that a nip is avoided, so that damage to the thread is prevented.

<CLAIMS>
A thread holder for a gripper of a gripper loom having a 
gap formed by a first (1) and a second (2) retention 

member, wherein the first and second retention members 
(1, 2; 31, 32) are disposed lying inside one another at 

least partly so that the faces (22, 23) of the first and 
second retention members limiting the gap (21) form a 

rectilinear gap (21) having a curved cross-sectional 
shape,
characterised in that
 the second retention member (2; 32) 
is movably disposed in the first retention member (1; 31) 

in its longitudinal extension so that the faces (22, 23) 
limit a gap (21) having a width remaining constant in the 

effective direction of the thread holder and having a 
cross-sectional contour continuously increasing in the 

effective direction, in which gap an inserted weft thread 
(45) is held by frictional force. 
A holder according to Claim 1,
characterised by
 a bearing point (10; 36, 37) and a guide 
point (11) spaced therefrom, which are disposed in the 

longitudinal extension of the second retention member (2; 
32) outside the gap (21) in order to align the faces (22, 

23), limiting the gap (21), of the first and second 
retention member with respect to one another. 
A holder according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the first retention member (1, 31) 
has a long recess (12) having a semi-circular base and 

having a cross-sectional contour increasing in the 
effective direction, which forms the one face (22) 

limiting the gap (21),
and in that
 the second retention member is a needle (2; 
32) having a constant cross-sectional contour, which 

forms the other face (23) limiting the gap (21).  
 
A holder according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 a shoulder (9) is provided at 
the first retention member (1) in order to limit the 

effective length of the gap (21). 
A holder according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised by
 a mechanism (3, 5; 33) for 
operating the second retention member, which is 

disposed on the first retention member (1, 31), in 
order to open the gap (21) for the purpose of 

cleaning and respectively to reset it. 
A holder according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the mechanism has a member (5) 
which is pivoted on the first retention member (1, 

31) and can be brought into active communication 
with the second retention member (2, 32) in order to 

open the gap (21) and has a restoring member (3; 33) 
in order to reset the ga
p (21). 
A holder according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the restoring member (3; 33) 
is elastically deformable. 
A holder according to one of Claims 6 or 7,
characterised in that
 the member (3,; 33) has guide 
means (40) for the second retention member (2, 32). 
A holder according to one of Claims 5 or 6,
characterised by
 a driving mechanism (49) for the 
member (5). 
A gripper loom having a thread holder according to 
one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised by
 a cleaning device (51, 52) for the 
thread holder.
