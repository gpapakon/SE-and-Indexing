<ABSTRACT>
Identification of the molecular targets of a drug or toxin is the first step in understanding how the drug or toxin works, and important advance in learning how to improve a drug or assess the risks due to a toxin. The primary action of a drug usually involves binding to a protein; secondary actions may express themselves in the form of side effects and in some cases may be due to binding to other proteins. Consequently, it is useful to identify all physiologically relevant sites of action of a drug or toxin. A simple method for obtaining a list of the potential targets of a drug, toxin or other biologically active substance (referred to collectively as ligands) involves a multistep process. The first step is screeening a protein or peptide library to identify library members that exhibit high affinity for a particular ligand. The second step involves searching of sequence data bases for proteins that contain the sequences of the library members shown to have high affinity for the ligand. The proteins thus identified constitute a list of potential targets for the ligand. If random peptide libraries have been used, the position of identified consensus sequences within the identified protein constitutes an identification of the potential ligand binding site on the target.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IDENTIFICATION OF MOLECULAR TARGETSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed, in general, to a method for the identification of the molecular targets for drugs or toxins in an organism or other biological system.Most drugs or toxins express their activity by binding to proteins. These proteins are referred to as receptors, drug targets or molecular targets (Gies, 1996). Drugs (pharmaceuticals), toxins and other biologically active molecules will be referred to herein as ligands. Identification of the ligand target is the crucial first step in understanding how a ligand affects a biological system. Currently, this identification is usually a long and arduous process. The identification of a ligand' s target is desirable, however, because it provides essential information for the improvement of the drug or assessment of toxicity or side effects.Many drugs are now designed specifically to bind to a particular target protein, and their primary target is not in doubt. However, it is possible for these drugs to have additional targets to which they bind that give rise to unexpected or unwanted biological effects (toxicities or side effects). The origin of these side effects or toxicities is not always clear from the primary mode of action of the drug. Identification of secondary targets, the interaction with which leads to side effects, may aid initial toxicological evaluations on humans by identifying potential biological systems to monitor, aiding in the interpretation of observed adverse effects, or providing information that could be used to counteract these effects. In addition to designed drugs, natural products or synthetic organics are often screened for a particular biological activity (e.g., killing of human cancer cells in culture), and those displaying desirable activities are identified and developed without foreknowledge of the molecular target through which its activity is derived. The first step in understanding the mode of action of these drugs is to determine the molecular target of the drug. This is often a slow and expensive 

process. However, identification of the primary and secondary targets of these types of drugs is crucial to their further development and toxicological evaluations.Prior to human testing of a new drug, a drug is tested on animals to evaluate its toxicity. The success of these toxicological screens depends on the efficacy with which the animal model mimics the human systems to be effected. If the molecular targets of the animal are essentially

We claim:
1. A process for the identification of a protein which binds to a ligand, the ligand having a molecular weight which is less than 5,000 Daltons and being other than a nucleic acid, peptide or protein, the process comprising: screening the ligand against a peptide or protein library, said library comprising a set of genetic packages physically linking each peptide or protein member of the library to a nucleic acid polymer which encodes that member, separating from the library members of the library which have an affinity for the ligand which is greater than the affinity possessed by other members of the library for the ligand, determining the nucleic acid sequences which encode the members which have been separated from the library and translating these nucleic acid sequences into peptide sequences, and identifying protein(s) which contain a portion of the translated peptide sequences or which correspond to consensus peptide sequences derived from statistical analysis of said translated library member peptide sequences.
2. The process of claim 1 wherein the ligand is an organic molecule conjugated with a plating agent.
3. The process of claim 2 wherein the peptide or protein members of the library are selected from the group consisting of expression products of a CDNA library derived from a cell and fragments of those expression products.
4. The process of claim 2 wherein the plating agent is biotin.
5. The process of claim 3 wherein the ligand is biotinylated dioxin.
6. The process of claim 1 wherein the peptide or protein members of the library are selected from the group consisting of expression products of a CDNA library derived from a cell and fragments of those expression products. 

7. The process of claim 6 wherein the peptide or protein members of the library are selected by a method selected from the group consisting of random selection and weighted random selection.
8. The process of claim 6 wherein the peptide or protein members of the library are selected by a method selected from the group consisting of random selection and weighted random selection.
9. The process of claim 1 wherein the peptide or protein members of the library are selected by a method selected from the group consisting of random selection and weighted random selection.
10. The process of claim 1 wherein the peptide or protein library comprises a genetic package which displays the separate peptide or protein members of the library on the surface of the genetic package.
11. The process of claim 10 wherein the peptide or protein members of the library are genetically fused with a protein which is integrated into the surface of the genetic package.
12. The process of claim 10 wherein the genetic package is selected from the group consisting of phage, virus, yeast, and bacteria.
13. The process of claim 1 wherein the members of the library with higher affinity for the ligand are separated from members with a lower affinity for the ligand by a differentiation method selected from the group consisting of biopanning, chromatography, Western or Southern blotting, and electrophoresis.
14. The process of claim 1 wherein the members of the library with higher affinity for the ligand are separated from members of the library with lower affinity for the ligand by alternating a differentiation method selected from the group 


consisting of biopanning, chromatography, Western or Southern blotting, and electrophoresis with amplification of the genetic packages containing those members of the library with greater affinity for the ligand.
15. The method of claim 14 wherein the separation is effected by about two to three rounds of alternating the differentiation method and amplification of the genetic package.
