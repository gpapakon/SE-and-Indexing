<ABSTRACT>
In an IC card using a file management system for 
performing data management of a plurality of files 

obtained by dividing a data memory, when selection is 
performed to allow use of the file (ST20), discrimination 

ID information representing that each file is 
already selected is provided to each file (ST50). In 

accessing a file (ST70), the provided discrimination ID 
information (ID No.) is added to each access command to 

designate a specific access, and a file serving as an 
access target is recognized on the basis of the 

designated discrimination ID information (YES in ST80), 
thereby accessing the file (ST84).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a file management
system for managing data of a plurality of files divided
in a nonvolatile memory in a so-called IC card incorporating
an IC chip having the nonvolatile memory and a
control unit such as a CPU for controlling the nonvolatile
memory and the like.In recent years, an IC card incorporating an IC
chip having a nonvolatile data memory and a control unit
such as a CPU for controlling the data memory and the
like has received a great deal of attention as a
portable data storage medium.As described in US-A-4,988,855 (Iijima),
an IC card of this type divides an incorporated data
memory into a plurality of files and stores data
necessary for running a software application in each
file. An application ID (identification) name is input
from an external device to use selected or corresponding
application data. For this reason, a plurality of
application data are divided into files and stored in
a single IC card, thus allowing multi-purpose applications.
The preamble of claim 1 is based on the disclosure of US-A-4,988,855.A plurality of data files for storing data such as
transaction data and a key file for storing key information
for collating a password can belong to the above 
application files.A file attribute called an access condition is set
in each file. This access condition is determined by
selectively designating a collation state of key
information required at the time of access to the
corresponding file. For example, when an access
condition designates that the collation state of key
information A in an IC card is required, key information
A must be collated before this file is accessed.Assume that a given application program is to
access a file using a usable file discrimination ID
number. For example, when this file is to accessed
using file discrimination ID number 1, file discrimination
ID number 1 is set for the file, and key information
A is collated using this file discrimination ID
number 1, thereby allowing access to this file for the
first time. Assume that another file discrimination ID
number (e.g., discrimination ID number 2) is set by
another external application. In this case, if the
collation state of key information A which is
established using file discrimination ID number 1 is
succeeded unconditionally, the above external application
can access to the file, which requests the collation
state of key information A, without collating key
information A, thereby disabling to maintain security.It is an object of the present invention to
