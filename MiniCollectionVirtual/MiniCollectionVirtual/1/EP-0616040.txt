<ABSTRACT>
Process for treating cast iron with lamellar graphite intended for the manufacture of camshafts, according to which the said cast iron is heated to melting temperature before extracting, after decanting, the oxides from the cast iron, characterised in that 0.001 % to 0.02 % by weight of a deoxidising element is introduced into the cast iron bath before the casting with the aim of obtaining cast iron with lamellar graphite with a low oxygen and nitrogen content.

A process for the production of camshafts of flake graphite cast-iron
which is hardened by surface re-fusion wherein the cast-iron is raised to the

melting temperature, settlement of the cast-iron bath is effected and before
the casting operation a deoxidising element is introduced into said bath in

order to produce a flake graphite cast-iron with a low content of oxygen and
nitrogen, characterised by using a cast-iron whose sulphur content is less

than 0.035% by weight, said deoxidising agent being introduced in a
proportion of 0.001% to 0.02% by weight.
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the cast-iron to
be treated is of the following composition:

A process according to either one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in
that the deoxidising element is added in the form of an alloy whose content

of said element is between 5 and 30% by weight.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that
the addition of a deoxidising element to the cast-iron bath is preceded by an

operation for desulphurisation of the cast-iron bath when the initial flake
graphite cast-iron has a sulphur content of higher than 0.035% by weight.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the deoxidising element is formed by magnesium.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the deoxidising element is formed by calcium.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the deoxidising element is formed by barium. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in that
the deoxidising element is formed by cerium.
