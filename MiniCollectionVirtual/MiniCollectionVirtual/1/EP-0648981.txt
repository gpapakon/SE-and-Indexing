<ABSTRACT>
The installation possesses a heat accumulator (1) which is filled with water as storage medium, is connected or can be connected in a circuit to radiators via flow and return pipes (11,12) and is capable of absorbing heat from various heat sources. Arranged in the upper region of the heat accumulator is a flow-through heat exchanger (5,6) which is provided for heating drinking water and is arranged in series with a lower flow-through heat exchanger (2) which is provided in the lower region of the heat accumulator (1) for the purpose of preheating the drinking water and which preferably has the design of a hot-water tank (storage water heater).

Multivalent heating plant comprising a heat reservoir 
(1) filled with water as a heat storage medium which 

is connected or connectable via outflow and return 
flow lines (12, 11) in a circuit with radiators and 

which is able to take up heat from different heat 
sources, at least one upper through-flow heat exchanger 

(5, 6) arranged in the upper region of the 
heat reservoir (1) and arranged in series with a lower 

through-flow heat exchanger (2) arranged in the lower 
region of the heat reservoir (1) for the pre-warming 

of the drinking water, and a powerful heat source, in 
particular a combustion chamber (10) of a gas burner 

or oil burner or the like, arranged in the heat reservoir 
(1) between the lower through-flow heat exchanger 

(2) and the upper through-flow heat exchanger (5, 6) 
for the heating of the reservoir water, characterised 

in that the powerful heat source is arranged at a 
lower opening of a shaft (17) arranged in the heat 

reservoir (1), with the upper opening of the shaft 

communicating with the upper opening of at least one 
further shaft (18), and with the lower opening of the 

further shaft (18) being arranged alongside the powerful 
heat source in the heat reservoir (1) and preferably 

lying vertically above a heat exchanger (8) which 
is connected to an additional heat source (9); and in 

that the upper through-flow heat exchanger or heat exchangers 
(5, 6) are arranged in the upper connection 

area of the shafts (17, 18) in the heat reservoir (1). 
Heating plant in accordance with claim 1, characterised 
in that the lower through-flow heat exchanger is 

formed as a boiler (2).  
 
Heating plant in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that the outflow line (12) branches 

off from the heat reservoir (1) beneath the upper 
through-flow heat exchanger (5, 6). 
Heating plant in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the return flow line (11) 

is connected above the lower through-flow heat exchanger 
or boiler (2) or is selectively connectable 

above or below the lower through-flow heat exchanger 
or the boiler (2). 
Heating plant in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that a flat heat exchanger (8) 

is arranged beneath the lower through-flow heat exchanger 
or boiler (2) and is functionally connected to 

a collector (9) for solar energy. 
Heating plant in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the heat reservoir (1) has 

connections between the lower through-flow heat exchanger 
or boiler (2) and the upper heat exchanger (5, 

6) for feeding in warm water from various heat 
sources. 
Heating plant in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that a heat exchanger (13) is 

arranged outside of the heat reservoir (1) to pick up 
heat at a low temperature within a water circuit which 

leads through the lower region of the heat reservoir 
(1) used by the lower through-flow heat exchanger or 

boiler (2), and in particular from a region at the 
lower side of the lower through-flow heat exchanger or 

boiler (2), via the heat exchanger (13) and from there  
 

to a higher region of the heat reservoir (1), preferably 
closely above the lower through-flow heat exchanger 

or boiler (2). 
Heating plant in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 7, characterised in that the upper through-flow 

heat exchanger (5, 6) or a part of the latter is arranged 
in the zone of action of an electrical heater 

or electrical heating element. 
Heating plant in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that a pump (19) is present by 

means of which the water can be introduced from a vertically 
higher region of the heat reservoir (1) into a 

vertically lower region of the same.
