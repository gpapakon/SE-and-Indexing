<ABSTRACT>
The gun comprises a body (10) with a longitudinal passage (18) and a coupler (19) to be fixed onto a bottle containing the product, as well as a member for opening and closing the passage through the body (10) and the nozzle (12). The opposing front faces of the nozzle (12) and the body (10) comprise concave parts (34, 24), defining a housing for the opening and closing member (14), while the said member (14) is a rotary element capable of pivoting about an axis orthogonal to the axis of the said passage (18) under the action of an external actuating handle (16) against the action of elastic means. The gun is more particularly intended for portable extinguishers.

<CLAIMS>
Operating trigger for a fire extinguisher, 
comprising a body (10) with a longitudinal passage (18) 

for the extinguisher product and a connection piece (19) 
to be fixed, by way of a hose, to a canister containing 

the product, a product sprayer (12) intended to be 
screwed onto the body (10), on the opposite side from the 

connection piece (19), a rotary member for opening and 
closing the passage through the body (10) and the sprayer 

(12), and an external operating lever (16) for pivoting 
the opening and closing member (14), in which the 

opposing frontal faces of the sprayer (12) and of the 
body (10) include concave parts (34) (24) defining a seat 

for the opening and closing member (14), characterized in 
that the opening and closing member (14) and the external 

operating lever (16) are made up of a monobloc plastic 
component with a transverse shaft (38) lodged in bearings 

formed by the bottom of two opposite and open slots (46) 
of a cylindrical skirt (22) forming a longitudinal 

continuation of the body (10) around one of its concave 
parts (24), and in that the said monobloc component 

includes a flexible strip (48) extending obliquely from 
the handle (44) of the lever (16) and bearing on the 

outer wall of the body (10) in order to stress the lever 
(16) towards the closed position. 
Trigger according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sprayer (12) and the body (10) are made of 

plastic. 
Trigger according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the sprayer (12) has, around its concave frontal 

face, an annular groove (30) provided with a screw thread 
(32) intended to cooperate with a corresponding screw 

thread (26) of the cylindrical skirt (22) of the body 
(10). 
Trigger according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the screw threads (32), (26) are provide
d, 
respectively, on the outer wall of the groove (30) of the 

sprayer (12) and on the outer wall of the said skirt (22).  
 
Trigger according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the opposing frontal faces of the sprayer (12) and 

of the body (10) are cones of revolution (34), (24) of 
the same conicity, and in that the said rotary element is 

a ball valve (14) wedged between the said cones.
