<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for measuring the deformation (deflection) of a roadway (1), associated with a vehicle (2) comprising a chassis (10), front wheels (12) and a rear load axle (14) having 2 pairs of rear wheels (14a, 14b). The apparatus comprises a carriage (15) resting on the roadway (1) via three supports (16a, 16b, 16c). The means for determining the deformation comprise two feeler arms (18, 20) mounted so as to pivot on the carriage (15), the rear ends (18b, 20b) of which arms, provided with runners, are located on the forward paths of the centre distances (24a, 24b) of each pair of rear wheels (14a, 14b). Means (26) for moving the carriage (15) are associated with control means (28) for releasing the carriage before each measurement cycle and returning it to the front of the vehicle (2) after each measurement cycle. The rear support (16c) of the carriage (15) is located behind the rear axle (14) from the start of each measurement cycle and the apparatus comprises means (30a, 30b, 32a, 32b, 34a, 34b, 36a, 36b, 38a, 38b) for guiding the carriage, which are intended to guide it as a function of the lock-angle radius of the vehicle (2).
