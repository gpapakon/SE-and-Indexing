<ABSTRACT>
A line filter includes a magnetic core having a leg. A bobbin is 
placed around the leg of the magnetic core. The bobbin has end 

collars provided with projections respectively. A pair of windings 
are provided on the bobbin. A molded casing made of resin houses 

the magnetic core, the bobbin, and the windings. The casing has 
movable tongues which engage the projections on the bobbin collars 

to fix the bobbin to the casing. The casing has inner surfaces 
formed with ribs which engage the magnetic core to fix the 

magnetic core to the casing. The casing has an L-shaped movable 
member extending from a ceiling thereof and engaging the 

magnetic core to fix the magnetic core to the casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to an inductive device
including a winding on a magnetic core. This invention specifically
relates to a line filter provided in, for example, a power supply
circuit of an electronic apparatus to prevent entrance and leakage of
noise into and from the electronic apparatus via a power supply line.A line filter according to the preamble of
claim 1 is known from JP-A- 62 291 108.A typical prior-art line filter is used to damp or suppress
common-mode noise (generally, radio-frequency noise) which
occurs between a power supply line and a ground. The line filter
includes a pair of windings on a magnetic core. The filter windings
are disposed in a pair of line segments of the power supply line
respectively. A line current passing through the filter windings
causes magnetic flux. The magnetic core has such a configuration as
to form a closed magnetic circuit for the magnetic flux. To prevent
the magnetic core from being magnetically saturated, the
combination of the magnetic core and the filter windings is
designed so that the magnetic flux generated by one of the windings
can cancel the magnetic flux generated by the other winding.A first example of such a prior-art line filter includes a
magnetic core with a single opening, and a bobbin made of resin
which is positioned around one leg of the magnetic core. A pair of
windings are provided on the bobbin. The bobbin is formed with a 
gear. During assembly of the line filter, the bobbin is rotatably
supported on the leg of the magnetic core, and ends of wires are
connected to the bobbin. A suitable drive mechanism is set into
engagement with the gear on the bobbin. As the bobbin is rotated
relative to the magnetic core by the drive mechanism, the wires are
automatically wound on the bobbin to provide the filter windings.
After the filter windings have been completed, the bobbin and the
magnetic core are bonded together by adhesive.The adhesive tends to apply a stress to the magnetic core.
Such a stress causes a reduction of inductances of the filter
windings by 5-30% as the line filter ages.A second example of the prior-art line filter includes a
magnetic core with two openings, and a bobbin made of resin which
is positioned around a central leg of the magnetic core. A pair of
windings are provided on the bobbin. The bobbin is formed with a
gear. The second example of the prior-art line filter is assembled
similarly to the assembly of the first example of the prior-art line
filter.It is an object of this invention to provide an
