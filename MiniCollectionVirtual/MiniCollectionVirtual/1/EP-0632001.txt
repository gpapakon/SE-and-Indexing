<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method for 
producing a hydrofluorocarbon. The following reports have been made with respect to 
methods for preparing a hydrofluorocarbon using an 
iodofluorocarbon as a starting material. EP-A-0 508 631 discloses a process for the production of hydrofluorocarbon 
which process comprises contacting a fluorocarbon containing at least one 
atom of chlorine, bromine or iodine with a complex metal hydride and optionally 
a metal hydride. A method of conducting the reduction in the presence 
of the zinc (J. Fluorine Chem., 6,297, 1975). A method 
for the synthesis by a reaction employing a Grignard 
reagent (J. Fluorine Chem., 3,247, 1973). A method for 
the synthesis by a liquid phase reduction reaction 
employing hydrogen and a Raney nickel catalyst (Ger. 
Offen. 2,060,041, J. Chem. Soc., 3761,1953). A method 
for the synthesis by a reduction reaction by employing 
sodium hypophosphite and a palladium or platinum catalyst 
(J. Fluorine Chem., 55,101, 1991). A method of reacting 
a starting material with alcoholic KOH (J. Chem. Soc., 
3761, 1953). A method of reacting the starting material 
with an alkali metal hydroxide in methanol (EP 0,499,516  
 
A1). However, the above conventional methods were all 
liquid phase reactions, and they were batch reactions. 
Therefore, they were poor in the productivity and had a 
problem such that the large amount of an inflammable 
organic solvent was required or high pressure hydrogen 
was required for the reaction. The present inventors have conducted extensive 
studies on a method for efficiently producing a 
hydrofluorocarbon using an iodofluorocarbon as a starting 
material and as a result, have found a method whereby a 
hydrofluorocarbon can be obtained continuously at a high 
selectivity in good yield by reacting the 
iodofluorocarbon in a gas phase. Thus, the present invention provides a method for 
producing a hydrofluorocarbon of the formula HnRfH 
wherein n is 0 or 1, and when n is 0, Rf is a C2-12 linear 
or branched polyfluoroalkyl group, and when n is 1, Rf is 
a C2-12 linear or branched polyfluoroalkylene group, 
which comprises reacting an iodofluorocarbon of the 
formula InRfI wherein n and Rf are as defined above, with 
a reducing agent in a gas phase. Now, the present invention will be described in 
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. The iodofluorocarbon used as a starting material of 
the present invention is a compound of the formula InRfI, 
wherein n is 0 or 1, and when n is 0, Rf is a C2-12
