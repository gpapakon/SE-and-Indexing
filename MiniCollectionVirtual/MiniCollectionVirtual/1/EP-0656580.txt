<ABSTRACT>
A method and system disclosed for the automatic storage of an 
object within a container object within a graphical user 

interface within a data processing system. A display, 
included within the data processing system, is utilized to 

display an iconic representation of a container object which 
is a graphic indication of a storage of objects. An object 

and a container object within the graphical user interface 
are specified. The object is thereafter associated with the 

container object. During utilization the object is removed 
from the container object. The object is then automatically 

stored within the container object in response to a 
completion of the utilization, wherein the organization of 

objects within the container object and the graphical user 
interface are enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an improved
graphical user interface in a data processing system and in
particular to a method and system for the automatic storage
of an object within a container object within a graphical
user interface in a data processing system. Still more
particularly, the present invention relates to a method and
system for the automatic storage of an object within a
container object within a graphical user interface in a data
processing system in response to completion of utilization of
the object.Data processing systems commonly utilize graphical user
interfaces to enable users to interact with the data
processing system and manipulate the activities and functions
available to the users. Users may select, through the
graphical user interface, a particular activity to perform
utilizing input devices such as a keyboard or a "mouse." In
a graphical user interface, activities such as "print
document" or "select a document" may be represented to the
user in the form of function keys graphically displayed on
the computer display screen and selected by striking a
particular key on the keyboard, or as icons to be selected
utilizing a graphical pointing device such as a "mouse." A
pointer, or mouse cursor, on the display screen is typically
utilized to represent the current location of the "mouse."
By moving the "mouse," a user may move the pointer, or mouse 
cursor, around within the computer display screen.An object may be graphically represented to a user as an
"icon" utilizing the graphical user interface. An object is
an item which may be manipulated as a unit. Objects may be
of three types: device, data, or container. A device object
may be manipulated to perform a selected task such as
typically performed utilizing a physical or logical device
such as a printer, mouse, or facsimile machine. For example,
a "printer" device object may be manipulated to print
documents or text. Data objects may include documents or
text, such as created utilizing word processing applications.
Container objects are typically objects into which other
objects may be stored. Therefore, objects may be stored
together in a container object and manipulated as a unit by
manipulating the container object.Container objects, commonly called "folders," are typically
provided as part of a graphical user interface. These
"folders" may be iconically represented as a traditional
filing folder and may be utilized to group, or "store, " other
objects in a way which is meaningful to a user. Such
"folders"

<CLAIMS>
In a data processing system including a graphical user
interface (30) a method for automatically storing an object (34)

within a container object (32) within said data processing
system, said data processing system including a display

for displaying an iconic representation of said
container object, wherein said object is a

graphic object which may be removed from said container
object for utilization, said method comprising the data

processing system implemented steps of:

specifying an object (34) within said graphical user
interface;
specifying a container object (32) within said graphical user
interface;
associating said object with said container object;
removing said object from said container object for
utilization; and
automatically storing said object within said container
object in response to completion of said utilization of

said object, wherein organization of said objects within
said container object is enhanced.
In a data processing system including a graphical user
interface a method for automatically storing an object

within a container object within said data processing
system according to Claim 1, wherein said graphical user

interface includes a plurality of container objects,
further comprising the steps of:


determining if a temporary relationship between said
object and a second of said plurality of container

objects has been specified; and 
thereafter, automatically storing said object within

said second of said plurality of container objects in
response to a determination that said temporary

relationship between said object and a second of said
plurality of container objects has been specified.
In a data processing system including a graphical user
interface a method for automatically storing an object

within a container object within said data processing
system according to Claim 1 OR 2, further comprising a

step of displaying an indication of said container
object in response to a utilization of said object.
A data processing system including a graphical user
interface (30) for automatically storing an object (34) within a

container object (32) within said data processing system,
said data processing system including a display for

displaying an iconic representation of said container
object, wherein said object is a graphic

object which may be removed from said container object
for utilization, comprising:


means for specifying an object (34) within said graphical
user interface;
means for specifying a container object (32) within said
graphical user interface;
means for associating said object with said container
object;
means for removing said object from said container
object for utilization; and
means for automatically storing said object within said
container object in response to completion of said

utilization of said object, wherein organization of said
objects within said container object is enhanced.
A data processing system including a graphical user
interface for automatically storing an object within a

container object within said data processing system
according to Claim 4, wherein said graphical user

interface includes a plurality of container objects,
further comprising:


means for determining if a temporary relationship
between said object and a second of said plurality of

container objects has been specified; and
means for thereafter, automatically storing said object
within said second of said plurality of container

objects in response to a determination that said
temporary relationship between said object and a second

of said plurality of container objects has been
specified.
A data processing system including a graphical user
interface for automatically storing an object within a

container object within said data processing system
