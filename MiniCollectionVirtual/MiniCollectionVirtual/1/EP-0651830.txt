<DESCRIPTION>
A process for preparing m-phenylene 
isophthalamide fiber such as that taught in U.S. 
Patent No. 3,767,756 involves spinning the solution 
of the polymer, as prepared, including 
dimethylacetamide and by-product calcium chloride and 
contacting the extruded filaments with a hot inert 
gas such as nitrogen to partially remove solvent. A 
cold aqueous solution is used to quench and coagulate 
the filaments. Finally, the filaments are wash-drawn 
and collected. Satisfactory results have been 
achieved by this process, however, attempts to 
increase throughput in the quench-coagulation step 
has often resulted in non-uniformities as shown by 
opaque white streaks in the otherwise translucent 
filaments and by variations in tensile strength among 
the filaments. Also, fusion between filaments may 
occur as well because of slow, non-uniform cooling of 
some filaments. U.S. Patent No. 2,800,682 to Dooley 
taught the use of ultrasonic energy in rayon 
regeneration. The present invention has 
applicability to processes wherein the freshly 
extruded solvent-containing filaments first contact 
an inert gas or fluid before quench-coagulation with 
an aqueous solution as well as to wet-spinning 
processes wherein the solvent-containing filaments 
are spun directly into an aqueous quench-coagulation 
solution. Fig. 1 depicts a fiber manufacturing 
process under consideration in this invention. In  
 
Step 1, the polymer solution is extruded into 
filaments. In Step 2, the filaments are optionally 
contacted with a flow of hot inert gas to drive off 
part of the solvent. In Step 3, the filaments are 
contacted with a liquid which quenches and coagulates 
the filaments. In Step 4, the filaments are wash-drawn 
and in Step 5 the filaments are collected. Fig. 2 is a schematic side view of the 
chamber in which quench-coagulation takes place. The present invention provides an improved 
process for preparing fiber from a polymer solution as defined in claim 1.  
 The present invention is described below 
with reference to a process for preparing m-phenylene 
isophthalamide (MPDI) fiber. However, the invention 
can be applied to other processes such as the 
spinning process described in the aforementioned 
Blades patent for making poly(p-phenylene 
terephthalamide) fiber wherein the solvent-containing 
filaments leaving the spinneret are first passed 
through an air gap and then through aqueous liquid 
coagulant or a spinning process wherein the solvent-containing 
filaments leaving the spinneret are passed 
directly into

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing fiber from a polymer solution which 
includes the steps of: 


a) extruding the solution from a spinneret to form a plurality of 
filaments (5), 
b) treating the filaments with an aqueous liquid (3) to quench and 
coagulate the filaments (5), 
c) washing and drawing the filaments (5); and 
d) collecting the filaments (5); 
 
characterized by preparing an aromatic polyamide fiber, quench 

coagulating the filaments (5) more uniformly and more rapidly in step b) 
by passing the filaments between substantially parallel opposing walls (2) 

of a chamber containing the aqueous liquid coagulant (3), the said opposing 
walls comprising the faces of ultrasonic transducers (8), and driving 

the transducers (8), in phase, at a frequency of from 5 to 100 kHz to cause 
pressure fluctuations in the liquid coagulant (3), the spacing between the 

said opposing walls being less than one-half the wavelength of sound 
generated by the transducers (8) in the liquid coagulant (3). 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the polymer is an aramid. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the polymer solution that is 
extruded comprises m-phenylene isophthalamide, dimethylacetamide and 

calcium chloride. 
A process according to claim 3 wherein the extruded filaments (5) pass 
through a flow of hot nitrogen to drive off part of the solvent 

before quench coagulation. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the transducer faces are 
driven at a frequency in the range of 20 to 70 kHz. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein following step a) the extruded 

filaments (5) are passed through an inert gas.
