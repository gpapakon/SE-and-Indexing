<ABSTRACT>
In a helmet (1) for riding a vehicle, a chin cover 
(14) is expandably and contractibly upholstered at a 

lower edge of a chin covering portion (3a) for covering 
the user's chin. At least a portion of the chin cover 

(14) is formed of a mesh material (15), so that the 
egress of a user's breath through the mesh material (15) 

is promoted by wind flowing along a lower surface of the 
chin cover (14). Thus, it is possible to inhibit a wind 

noise due to the ingress of wind into the chin covering 
portion (3a) of the cap body (3) and to eliminate the 

retention of the user's breath in the chin covering 
portion (3a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention is helmets for use
by an occupant of a vehicle such as a motorcycle or a
racing car, and particularly, improvements in helmets of a
type having a chin covering portion provided in a cap body
for covering a user's chin, and a chin cover expandably and
contractibly upholstered at a lower edge of the chin
covering portion for covering the user's chin.If an occupant, for example, on a motorcycle uses a
helmet of the above-described structure, it is possible to
prevent the inclusion of running wind between the chin
covering portion and the user's chin by the chin cover,
even when travelling at a high speed, thereby inhibiting
the generation of wind noise.The chin cover of the prior art helmet is made of a
soft foam of synthetic resin material and has no air-permeability,
as disclosed in, for example, Japanese
Utility Model Publication No.16180/93.In the prior art helmet, a user's breath may stay in
the chin covering portion and condense on an inner surface
of a shield plate, because the chin cover is non-permeable
as described above. DE-A-2846636 describes a helmet having the
precharacterising features of claim 1.WO 86/05369 describes a full face helmet having a
one piece shell. A portion of flexible material is
fitted to the inside surface of the lower portion of the
shell in order to provide an air seal between the helmet
and a chin of a wearer of the helmet. The flexible
material may comprise a convoluted strip of flexible
material, flexible brush element or a strip of fabric
mesh.According to the present invention, a helmet is
provided which has the characterising features of claim
1.With the construction in accordance with the present
invention, it is possible to inhibit the ingress of air
flow into the chin covering portion of a cap body while
travelling at a high speed and to promote egress of the
user's breath through the mesh material by air flow
flowing along a lower surface of the chin cover. Thus,
it is possible to inhibit the generation of wind noise
and to inhibit condensation on the inner surface of a
visor due to the retention of the user's breath.Furthermore, when the helmet is put on or taken off,
this can be performed without any obstruction by the
auxilliary cap body and the chin cover, by previously
turning the auxilliary cap body to the lifted position.For a better understanding of the present invention,
reference will now be made, by way of example, to the
accompanying drawings, in which:-

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A helmet for riding a vehicle, having a cap body
(2,3) and a chin covering portion (3a) provided in said

cap body for covering a chin of a user (U), said cap body
comprising:


a main cap body (2) having a large window (4) opened
at a lower front end of the main cap body (2);
an auxilliary cap body (3) forming said chin
covering portion (3a) and having a pair of ear portions

(3b) carried on left and right sidewalls of said main cap
body (2) for turning movement of the auxilliary cap body

(3) between a lowered position (A), in which a lower half
of said large window (4) is covered with said chin

covering portion (3a) to define an upper half of said
large window (4) into a small window (5), and a lifted

position (B), in which said large window (4) is entirely
opened; and
an expandable and contractible chin cover (14) for
covering a lower face of the chin of the user (U), said

chin cover (14) being provided at a lower edge of said
chin covering portion (3a),

characterised in that a front region (15) of said
chin cover (14) is made of a mesh material promoting the

egress of user's breath due to the reduced pressure
around such region when the wind is flowing at high speed

at the lower surface of the chin cover (14) and a rear
region (16) made of fabric material guiding the air

passing along the lower surface of the cap body (1) to
flow rearwardly, the rear edge of the fabric material

further comprising a resilient string (17), for
resiliently urging at least a rear portion of said chin

cover (14) into a contracted state.
A helmet for riding a vehicle according to claim 1,
wherein said chin cover (14) is crescent-shaped. 
A helmet for riding a vehicle according to claim 1
or 2, wherein said resilient string (17) comprises a

rubber string sewn at the rear edge of said chin cover
(14).
