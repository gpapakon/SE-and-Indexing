<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a precoating head (1) for building up a filter cake in a filter support (2) having an inlet port (5) for the filter aid and having a baffle element (7) arranged below the mouth of the inlet port for deflecting the filter aid stream. In order to obtain a more uniform filter cake build up, according to the invention a distributor grid (10) is arranged at a distance from the baffle element.
