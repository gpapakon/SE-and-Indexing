<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR OBTAINING A NON-LIQUID CELL SAMPLEBackground of the InventionAdvances in recombinant DNA technology have made possible the molecular analysis and prediction of several genetic disorders. At the present time, genetic analyses are carried out mainly using blood leukocytes, which are obtained from whole blood (e.g. via centrifugation). Whole blood, in turn must be obtained clinically by a physician or phlebotomist employing an invasive technique (e.g. venipuncture).A non-invasive method for obtaining genetic material using a mouthwash has been described (Lench, N., et. al.. The Lancet 1 : 1356-8 (June 18, 1988)). In this method, an individual rinses his mouth with saline which is then emitted from the mouth into a container. The container is centrifuged and cells, which are pelleted upon centrifugation, are collected. The ease with which samples can be obtained is a major attraction of this method. However, samples so obtained are in a liquid format and therefore present problems with regard to handling, processing and contamination.DNA for genetic analysis has also been obtained from cervicovaginal cells (Burk, .D. and C. Spitzer, Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol.162:652-4 (1990)). In a study which compared the quantative yield of cellular material obtained by various methods, cervicovaginal lavage was found to be superior to scrape, swab or brush methods for obtaining cervicovaginal cells (Goldberg, GL et. al., Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 161 : 1169-72 (1989); Vermund, SH et. al., Ann. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 160: 304-8 (1989)). However, cervicovaginal cells obtained by lavage are in a liquid format and therefore present the same problems with handling, processing and contamination as samples obtained by mouthwashing techniques. 

 For forensic purposes, DNA has been obtained from epithelial cells, spun from urine (Gasparinin, P. et. al., N. Engl. J. Med. 320: 809 (1989)); and from root and surrounding sheath cells obtained from plucked hairs (Higuchi, R. et. al.. Nature 332:543-6 (1988)). However, samples so obtained often do not contain enough DNA for genetic analysis. Therefore hair and urine samples are not optimal for clinical analysis.A simple, noninvasive technique for obtaining a non-liquid cell sample having an appropriate amount of genetic material for clinical analysis would be useful.Summary of the InventionThe invention relates to a simple, noninvasive process for obtaining a non- liquid cell sample from an animal for genetic analysis. The process involves inserting an appropriately sized brush

Claims
1. A process for obtaining a non-liquid animal ceil sample comprising the steps of:
a) inserting a brush having bristles and capable of being inserted into an animal's oral cavity; b) contacting the bristles of the brush with an oral membrane comprising cells; c) agitating the brush against the membrane so that cells from the membrane are captured in the brush bristles; d) removing the brush containing captured cells from the oral cavity, thereby obtaining a non-liquid cell sample.
2. A process of Claim 1 wherein the brush is spiral.
3. A process of Claim 1 wherein the animal is a human.
4. A non-liquid cell sample obtained according to the method of Claim 1.
5. A process for conducting a genetic analysis of an animal comprising the steps of:
a) inserting a brush having bristles and capable of being inserted into an animal's oral cavity; b) contacting the bristles of the brush with an oral membrane comprising cells; c) agitating the brush against the membrane so that cells from the membrane are captured in the brush bristles; d) removing the brush containing captured cells from the oral cavity; and e) lysing the cells obtained in step d), thereby yielding genetic material; f) conducting a genetic analysis on the genetic material. 


6. A process of Claim 5 wherein the animal is a human.
7. Genetic material obtained according to the method of Claim 5.
8. A process for detecting the presence of a particular nucleic acid sequence of interest in genetic material contained in cells obtained from an animal, comprising the steps of :
a) inserting a brush having bristles and capable of being inserted into a mammal's oral cavity; b) contacting the bristles of the brush with an oral membrane comprising cells; c) agitating the brush against the membrane so that cells from the membrane are captured in the brush bristles; d) removing the brush containing captured cells from the oral cavity; e) lysing the cells obtained in step d), thereby yielding genetic material; g) contacting the genetic material with a detectable nucleic acid sequence complementary to the nucleic acid sequence of interest; h) allowing the genetic sequences and the detectable nucleic acid sequence to hybridize; and i) detecting hybridization as an indication of the presence of the nucleic acid sequence of interest.
9. A process of Claim 8 wherein the animal is a human.
