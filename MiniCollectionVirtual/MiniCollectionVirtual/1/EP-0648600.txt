<ABSTRACT>
A laminated draw-formed container that is obtained 
by draw-forming a laminated material of a metal plate on 

which a resin film is laminated into a cup having 
bottom, wherein said resin film comprises a surface 

layer of a high molecular oriented copolymerized 
polyester derived from acid components of 85 to 97% of 

terephthalic acid and 3 to 15% of isophthalic acid, and 
a diol component, and a lower layer of a low molecular 

oriented copolymerized polyester (B) derived from acid 
components of 84.5 to 96.5% of terephthalic acid and 3.5 

to 15.5% of isophthalic acid, the amount of the 
isophthalic acid being larger than that of the 

copolymerized polyester (A) of the surface layer, and a 
diol component, and said surface layer having 
a double 
refraction method orientation degree (Δ n) as 

represented by the following relation, 

Δn = n₁ - n₂ 
   wherein n₁ is an index of double refraction in the 
direction of a maximum orientation of the film, and

 
   n₂ is an index of double refraction in the 

direction of thickness of the film,
 

which is not smaller than 0.02. The laminated 
draw-formed container exhibits markedly improved dent 

resistance and corrosion resistance even after the 
container is preserved, as well as improved adhesion 

property and workability, and prevents the adsorption of 
flavor components and the elution of resin components 

into the content, making it possible to greatly improve 
flavor retentivity of the content.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated
draw-formed container having excellent
flavor-retentivity and shock resistance (dent
resistance). More specifically, the invention relates
to a container which is obtained by draw-forming a
material comprising a metal plate on which is laminated
a polyester film, the container exhibiting improved
performance for retaining flavor of the content and
improved dent resistance.Conventional side seamless cans can be represented
by those obtained by subjecting a metal blank such as an
aluminum plate, a tin plate or a tin-free steel plate to
at least one stage of draw working between a drawing die
and a punch thereby to form a cup consisting of a barrel
without side seam and a bottom that is connected to the
barrel without forming seam, and then, as required,
subjecting the barrel to the ironing between an ironing
punch and a die to reduce the thickness of the barrel of
the container. It has also been known to reduce the
thickness of the side wall relying upon the
bend-elongation by using the corner portion of a
redrawing die (Japanese Patent Publication No.
501442/1981).As a method of covering side seamless cans with an
organic material, furthermore, there has been known a
method of laminating a resin film on a metal blank of
before it is formed into a can in addition to the
generally employed method of applying an organic paint 
onto the formed cans. Japanese Patent Publication No.
34580/1984 teaches use of a metal blank on which is
laminated a polyester film derived from terephthalic
acid and tetramethylene glycol. It has further been
known to produce redraw-formed cans relying upon the
bend-elongation by using a metal plate coated with a
vinyl organosol, an epoxy, a phenolics, a polyester or
an acryl.Japanese Patent Application No. 101930/1991 filed
by the present inventors discloses a coated metal plate
for cans comprising a laminate of a metal plate, a
polyester film layer composed of an ethylene
terephthalate unit as a chief component and, as
required, an adhesive primer layer interposed between
the metal plate and the polyester film layer, said
polyester film layer having an X-ray diffraction
intensity ratio as defined by the following formula (1),
RX = IA/IBwherein IA denotes an X-ray diffraction intensity
by a diffraction plane which is in parallel with
the surface of the polyester film and having a
spacing of about 0.34 nm (CuKα X-ray diffraction
angle of from 24° to 28°), and IB denotes an
X-ray diffraction intensity by a diffraction plane
which is in
