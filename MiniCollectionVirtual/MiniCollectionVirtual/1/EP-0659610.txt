<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for adjusting the orientation of a rear
view mirror, of the type comprising:


at least one electrical drive means such as an
electric motor (3, 4);
a means (46) for measuring the voltage of a battery
(Vbat), which produces a signal (TDbat) representing

the battery voltage (Vbat);
a means (7, 8, ADC, 47H, 47V) for measuring
variations in the reaction torque exerted on the said

motor, which produces at least one signal of
measurement of the torque variations;
a control panel accessible to a user, which produces
at least one adjustment control signal (CMHA, CMVA);

which are connected to a control unit (1) that produces
at least one signal (CHD, CVD) for the control of the

power supply circuits (43, 44) of the motor or motors
(3, 4) based on an item of control information

determined by the said control unit (1), whereby to
adjust the power supply to the said drive means (3, 4),

the control unit (1) including at least one means (50H,
50V) for determining the control signal, in the form of

a pulse width modulation signal, for governing the 
power supply circuits (43, 44) of the electric motor or

motors, the form factor of the pulse width modulation
being a function of the battery voltage measurement

signal (TDbat) and the torque variation measurement
signal, the control unit (1) including at least one

memory (42) in which are entered tables of values of
the form factor, which can be addressed as a function

of variations in the torque and in the value of the
battery voltage (Vbat) respectively.
Adjusting apparatus according to Claim 1,
characterised in that a variation in the reaction

torque exerted on the motor (3, 4) by the aggregate of
the mechanisms of the rear view mirror is detected by a

contrary variation of the velocity of displacement of a
moving part of the rear view mirror, such as a

reflector (6) driven by the said motor, with respect to
a predetermined displacement velocity.
Adjusting apparatus according to Claim 2,
characterised in that the control unit (1) includes an

analog/digital converter (ADC) which receives a signal
(RMHA, RMVA) of measurement of the instantaneous

position of the reflector (6), this signal being
produced by at least one position sensor (7, 8), and

includes a computing means (47H, 47V) which produces a
signal representing the velocity of displacement of the

reflector (6), which is communicated to the input of a
circuit (49H, 49V) for generating a first memory 

address signal, for access to a range of values of the
form factor which are such as to apply a power supply

voltage to the motor (3, 4) that produces a
displacement of the reflector (6) at a substantially

constant velocity, equal to the said predetermined
displacement velocity, so long as the control signal

concerned (CMHA, CMVD) is activated, and so long as an
end of travel condition has not been verified by the

control unit.
An adjusting apparatus according to Claim 1 or
Claim 2, characterised in that the control unit (1)

comprises an analog/digital converter (ADC) which
receives the signal (TDbat) representing the battery

voltage (Vbat), and which produces a signal
representing a measurement of the battery voltage

(ACC1), which is applied to the input of a circuit (56)
for generating a second memory address signal for

access to a range of values of the form factor which
are such as to apply to the motor (3, 4) a power supply

voltage that is independent of the value of the battery
voltage (Vbat).
Adjusting apparatus according to Claim 4,
characterised in that the values of the form factor of

the modulation (PWM) follow a law which decreases with
the battery voltage (Vbat). 
Adjusting apparatus according to Claim 3,
characterised in that the values of the form factor of

the modulation (PWM) follow a law which decreases with
the values of the displacement velocity of the

reflector (6).
Adjusting apparatus according to Claim 6,
characterised in that the variations in the

displacement velocity of the reflector (6) of the rear
view mirror are detected by a test (21) which consists

in verifying whether, during a predetermined time
period, defined as the period of time necessary to

obtain, at the desired displacement velocity, a
variation of one bit in the value of the signal (RMVA,

RMHA) which represents the position of the reflector
(6) and which is put in digital form (RMVD, RMHD) under

the control of an interposed analog/digital converter
(ADC), the said digital value (RMVD, RMHD) has

effectively varied by one bit.
Adjusting apparatus according to any one of the
preceding Claims, characterised in that the apparatus

for adjusting the rear view mirror includes at least
one sensor (7, 8) for sensing the position of the

reflector (6) of the rear view mirror with respect to a
fixed part (5) of the said rear view mirror.
Adjusting apparatus according to claim 8,
characterised in that the sensor (7, 8) for sensing the 

position of the reflector (6) of the rear view mirror
is a sensor of the angle prevailing between an axis of

the said reflector (6) and an axis of the said fixed
part (5) of the rear view mirror, for example a

potentiometer the value of the resistance of which is
linked to the value of the said angle.
A rear view mirror having an electrical driving
means, for example a motor vehicle rear view mirror, of

the type including an electrical control unit for
permitting positioning of the reflector (6) at a first

velocity, referred to as a fast speed, in two distinct
positions which consist of a first position, referred

to as a normal forward travel position, and a second
position referred to as a reverse travel position,

characterised in that the adjustment of these two
positions is effected, at a second velocity referred to

as a slow speed since it is slower than the said first
velocity, by an adjusting apparatus in accordance with

any one of Claims 1 to 9.
A rear view mirror according to Claim 10,
characterised in that the control unit for controlling

the positioning of the rear view mirror includes means
for passing automatically from the normal forward

travel position to the reverse travel position and vice
versa. 
A rear view mirror according to Claim 11,

characterised in that it includes at least one means
for detecting activation of the "reverse travel"

velocity, the shift from the normal forward travel
position to the reverse travel position taking place

automatically once the "reverse travel" velocity has
been set by the driver, and, conversely, the shift from

the reverse travel position to the normal forward
travel position taking place automatically once the

"reverse travel" velocity is no longer set.
