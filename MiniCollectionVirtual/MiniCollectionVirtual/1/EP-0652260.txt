<ABSTRACT>
Material coated with bitumen emulsion for coating and process for its manufacture, comprising a continuous aqueous phase, a bitumen dispersion and an emulsifying agent, capable of being converted by breaking, so as to produce a road binder. According to the invention the aqueous phase comprises a gelling agent. This emulsion permits a stable, cold coating of granulates of varied sizes, independently of their moisture content.
