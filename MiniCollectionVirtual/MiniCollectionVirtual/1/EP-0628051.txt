<ABSTRACT>
Structural analogs of the six non-fluorescent N-nucleosides commonly found in RNA and DNA, which are inherently fluorescent under physiological conditions, are identified and methods for their preparation provided. Such analogs may be incorporated into DNA and/or RNA oligonucleotides via either enzymatic or chemical synthesis to produce fluorescent oligonucleotides having prescribed sequences. Such analogous sequences may be identical to, or the analogous complement of, template or target DNA or RNA sequences to which the fluorescent oligonucleotides can be hybridized. Methods of preparing either RNA or DNA oligonucleotide probes of the invention, intermediates used in such methods, and methods of using the probes of the invention in oligonucleotide amplification, detection, identification, and/or hybridization assays are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of fluorescent structural analogues of the
non-fluorescent nucleosides commonly found in DNA and RNA.The six commonly occurring N-nucleosides which predominate in the
composition of DNA and RNA from all sources are adenosine, thymidine, uridine,
cytidine, guanosine and inosine. These nucleotides do not absorb light at wavelengths
>290 nm and are effectively non-fluorescent under physiological conditions.Nucleotide sequences are commonly utilised in a variety of applications including
diagnostic and therapeutic probes which hybridise target DNA and RNA, and
amplification of target sequences. It is often necessary, or useful, to label nucleotide
sequences.Hybridisation of specific DNA or RNA sequences typically involves annealing
oligonucleotides of from 5 bases to more than 10,000 bases (10 kb). The majority of
oligonucleotide probes currently in research use are radioactively labelled; however,
because of (a) the short half-lives of the isotopes in common usage, (b) the safety
requirements, and (c) the costs of handling and disposal of radioactive probes, convenient
and sensitive non-isotopic methods of detection are required for hybridisation diagnostic
methods, to achieve widespread acceptance and application.In general, all non-isotopic methods of detecting hybridisation probes that are
currently available depend on some type of derivatisation of the nucleotides to allow for
detection, whether through antibody binding or enzymatic processing, or through the
fluorescence or chemiluminescence of an attached "reporter" molecule. In most cases,
oligonucleotides have been derivatised to incorporate single or multiple molecules of the
same reporter group, generally at specific cyclic or exocyclic positions.At the simplest level, non-nucleoside linkers and labels have been attached to the
3' or 5' end of existing oligonucleotides by enzymatic or chemical methods. Modification
of nucleoside residues internal to the sequence of a DNA or RNA strand has proven to
be a difficult procedure, since the reaction conditions must be mild enough to leave the
RNA or DNA oligomers intact and still yield reaction products which can participate in
normal Watson-Crick base pairing and stacking interactions. Numerous methods for both cyclic and exocyclic derivatisation of the N-nucleoside
have been described, including hapten labelling, amino- and thiol-derivatisation,
labelling with photobiotin and other biotinylating agents, dU-biotin
labelling, 11-digoxigenin-ddUTP labelling, AAIF,
