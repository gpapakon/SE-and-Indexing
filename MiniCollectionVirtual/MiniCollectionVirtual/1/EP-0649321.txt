<ABSTRACT>
A tracheostomy tube assembly comprises a tracheostomy tube (2), a fitting (4) to be mounted on the end of the tracheostomy tube (2), having a bore (6) in which the end (8) of the tracheostomy tube (2) can be received, a sealing member (10) which can be located between the outer surface of the tracheostomy tube (2) and the inner surface of the bore (6) in the fitting (4), and means (12) for urging the sealing member against the outer surface of the tracheostomy tube to form a seal between the fitting (4) and the tracheostomy tube (2). The assembly allows a sealed connection to be made to the end of a tracheostomy tube (2), so that a filter (20, 32) or a valve (34) (for example to assist in speech) can be fitted over a tracheostoma.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tracheostomy tube assembly, which 
includes a tracheostomy tube and a fitting which can be mounted 
on the end of the tube. A tracheostomy is a surgical procedure which creates an opening 
through the anterior surface of the neck into the trachea. The 
opening is referred to as a tracheostoma. It is performed to 
by-pass an upper airway obstruction, or to enable the provision 
of long term respiratory support via connection to a 
ventilator, or for some other medical reason. In order to 
enable the patient to speak it is necessary to provide a means 
of directing the flow of exhaled air through the larynx. This 
can conveniently be achieved by the incorporation of a valve. 
A tracheostomy tube can be provided to extend between the 
tracheostoma and the trachea. A nasal simulation device serves to simulate some of the 
functions of the nose, and optionally can include a speaking 
valve to assist in diverting the flow of exhaled air to permit 
speech. In a subject whose breathing functions normally, the nose and 
the mucous membrane lining of the nasal cavity perform 
important functions in conditioning incoming air. The 
convoluted passages and rich blood supply serve to increase 
both the temperature and humidity of the incoming air to 
minimise the differential in these parameters with those of the 
surface of the lungs. Normally some heat and moisture is also 
captured from exhaled air prior to its release to the 
atmosphere. The mucous lining of the nasal passages also 
serves to remove particles in the inhaled airstream, and the 
action of the cilia transports mucous and any particles away 
from the lungs.  
 The exchange of heat and moisture and filtration are clearly 
beneficial to the patient, and in their absence clinical 
consequences such as increased incidence of chest infections, 
elevated levels of secretion production and encrustation are 
observed. When a patient has received a tracheostomy, in effect all 
inhaled air enters the lungs via the tracheostoma, and the nose 
is effectively not involved in the inhalation process. Exhaled 
air may pass through the tracheostoma or, if a voice prosthesis 
has been fitted, the stoma can be occluded so that the exhaled 
air is diverted through the voice prosthesis into the pharynx 
and the mouth, enabling the patient to speak. It is desirable 
that the flow of the exhaled air be controlled by means of a 
tracheostoma valve. In these situations, the valve can be 
arranged to remain open during breathing but, with a small 
a

<CLAIMS>
A tracheostomy tube assembly, which comprises: 

(a) a tracheostomy tube (2) having an exposed end (8); 
(b) a fitting (4) for mounting on the end (8) of the 
tracheostomy tube (2), having a bore (6) for receiving the 

end (8) of the tracheostomy tube (2); 
(c) a sealing member (10) for location between the 
outer surface of the tracheostomy tube (2) and the inner 

surface of the bore (6) in the fitting (4); and 
(d) means (12) for urging the sealing member (10) against 
the outer surface of the tracheostomy tube (2) to form a seal 

between the fitting (4) and the tracheostomy tube (2), for 
mounting on the tracheostomy tube (2) by way of its exposed 

end, 
 
the fitting (4) and the urging means (12) being removable from the 

tracheostomy tube (2) by way of its exposed end (8) while the tube (2) is 

in situ
 in a patient's tracheostoma. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 1, in which at least one 
of the fitting (4) and the urging means (12) presents an 

inclined face (16, 18) to the sealing member (10), so that the 
sealing member can be deformed against the outer surface of the 

tracheostomy tube (2) by being forced against the said inclined 
face. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 2, in which both the 
fitting (4) and the urging means (12) present inclined faces to 

the sealing member (10). 
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, in 
which the urging means (12) comprises a sleeve member which can  

 
engage the fitting with the sealing member (10) located between 

them, and can be moved relative to the fitting (4) to deform 
the sealing member into sealing contact with the outer surface 

of the tracheostomy tube (2). 
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, in 
which the fitting (4) and the urging means (12) have 

complimentary threads, by which they engage one another. 
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, in 
which the fitting (4) has formations for engaging a filter 

device (20). 
An assembly as claimed in claim 6, in which the 
formations comprise a slot which is open along at least one 

edge to allow a filter device to be inserted. 
An assembly as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, which 
includes a housing, the housing and the fitting having 

complimentary formations by which they can engage one another. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 8, in which the housing 
contains a valve. 
An assembly as claimed in claim 8 or claim 9, in which 
the housing contains a filter.
