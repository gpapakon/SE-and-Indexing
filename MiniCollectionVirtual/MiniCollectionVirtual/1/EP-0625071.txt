<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for hydrogenation of carbohydrates and hydrogenolysis of higher polyhydric alcohols, and to a new hydrogenation catalyst which, is useful in particular for producing lower polyhydric alcohols from renewable materials, such as in particular carbohydrates and higher polyhydric alcohols.In the present description, the term "higher polyhydric alcohols" means products such as sorbitol, mannitol and xylitol derived from catalytic hydrogenation of carbohy¬ drates (and in particular of glucose, fructose and their mixtures) .The term "lower polyhydric alcohols" means polyalcohols having a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and a maximum of 3 hydroxyl groups, in particular ethanediol, propylene glycol, butanediol and glycerol.The invention also relates to a method for preparing the new catalyst.U.S. 2,868,847 describes method for catalytic hydrogenation of mono- and disaccharides for producing polyhydroxyl alcohols, in particular sorbitol, and propos¬ es replacing the known platinum and palladium- based catalysts used for this method, by a ruthenium catalyst or by a metallic catalyst based on ruthenium and platinum or palladium.U.S. 4,476,331 describes a method for producing lower polyhydric alcohols comprising a first stage of 

hydrogenation of carbohydrates with production of higher polyhydric alcohols and a second stage in which the higher polyhydric alcohols are subjected to hydrogenolysis in the presence of a ruthenium-based catalyst which is pre- sulphonated or is sulphonated in use by addition 'of sulphonated compounds to the reactive medium. Sulphonation of the ruthenium-based catalyst is necessary in order, to limit the hydrogenolysis reaction which would otherwise lead to the formation of highly hydrogenated compounds (hydrocarbons, and in particular methane).The main object of the present invention is to provide a method for hydrogenolysis of higher polyhydric alcohols which has a high level of selectiveness towards the production of lower polyhydric alcohols, thus keeping to a minimum the formation of gaseous hydrocarbons which constitute an undesirable product.For this purpose an object of the present invention is a new metallic catalyst on an inert support, characterised in that it comprises the following relative to the (anhydrous) weight of the catalyst: a) 0.5 to 5 weight % ruthenium; b) 0.1 to 10 weight % tin.A second object of the invention is a method for producing lower polyhydric alcohols and their mixtures by means of hydrogenolysis under pressure of higher
