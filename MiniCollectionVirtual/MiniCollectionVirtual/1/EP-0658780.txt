<ABSTRACT>
Directional filter, characterised by a plurality of lamellae (L, Figure 2) which form mutually parallel beam wells (beam shafts), the interspaces being filled (Figure 4) by transparent support bodies (T, Figure 1) whose refractive index causes the incident light to be refracted towards the normal on the plane of incidence, and methods for the production thereof.

A directional filter comprising a plurality of
lamellae (L), which form ray shafts parallel to one

another, and comprising transparent support members
(T) which fill the gaps between the lamellae (L),


characterised in that
 it is constructed from U-shaped
support members (T), the outsides of said

support members (T) forming light exit surfaces of
the directional filter and the support members (T)

so cooperating with the lamellae (L) disposed
between them that the light incident on the support

members (T) from the zone enclosed by the support
members (T) is refracted towards the perpendicular

to the incident surface, because of the refractive
index of the support members (T), on entry into the

latter, and on passage through the support members
(T) is collimated outwards towards the said light

exit surface, both in the zone of the base and in
the zone of the limbs of the U-shaped support

members (T), and 
in that
 the individual lamellae
have a different colour or different colours on

each side.
A directional filter according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the material of the lamellae
(L) has an absorbent action and 
thus reduces the
reflection of light.
A directional filter according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the lamellae (L) are made
from highly reflective material, more particularly

metallised paints or vapour-coated metal, which is 
applied to a smooth or polished bonding surface (G)

of the support members (T).
A directional filter according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
individual lamellae (L) have a different reflection

and/or absorption property on each side and this is
therefore suitable for guiding the light into a

required direction.
A directional filter according to claims 4 and 5,

characterised in that
 the directional filter is so
designed that it can be turned by the user and the

emerging light can thus be projected into the
required direction.
A directional filter according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
surfaces of the individual lamellae (L) are

corrugated (Fig. 24) or angled (Fig. 23) and thus
prevent lateral observation through the directional

filter.
A directional filter according to any one of claims
1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the U-shaped support
members (T, Fig. 25) protect from environmental

influences a light source enclosed by said members.
A directional filter according to claim 7,

characterised in that
 the support members (T) which
surround and protect the light source by their U-shaped

configuration, are supplemented by a collar
at the top end of the U-shape, said collar 

projecting into the U-opening so that the light
source is further enclosed (Fig. 26).
A directional filter according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the
surfaces of the support members (T) are uniformly

structured so that the diffuse light is given a
characteristic with a lustre (Figs. 20 and 21).
A directional filter according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 thin films
are used to form the lamellae (L).
A directional filter according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the support
members (T, Figs. 1, 6, 9, 21 and 25) are made of

acrylic.
A directional filter according to any one of claims
1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 the support members
(T, Figs. 1, 6, 9, 21 and 25) are made from glass.
A directional filter according to any one of claims
1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 the support members
(T, Figs 1, 6, 9, 21 and 25) can be made by an

injection moulding process.
A directional filter according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 absorbent
or reflecting dyes which form the lamellae (L) on

the support member (T) are added to the glue or
adhesive used to connect the support members (T). 
A directional filter according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 to form the
lamellae (L) only the different refractive indices

between the support member (T) and the air
contained in a narrow slot are used (Figs. 5 and

8).
A method of making a directional filter according
to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
in that
 after they have been produced the bonding
surface (G) of the support members (T), Fig. 6) is

roughened or said members are made with a rough
bonding surface (G) and the lamellae (L, Fig. 7)

are then applied to said bonding surfaces (G) and
said elements are then interconnected (Fig. 7).
A method according to claim 16, 
characterised in
that
 the support members (T) are mechanically
roughened after they have been made.
A method according to claim 16, 
characterised in
that
 the support members (T) are chemically
roughened after they have been made.
A method according to claim 16, 
characterised in
that
 the mould for making the support member (T) is
roughened and the support members (T) moulded

therein therefore have a rough bonding surface (M).
A method for making a directional filter according
to any one of claims 1 to 15, more particularly

according to any one of claims 17 to 19,

characterised in that
 the support members (T) are
made by an extrusion process, are combined, 

connected and then cut to the appropriate width or
length, perpendicularly to the plane of the

lamellae.
Use of a directional filter according to any one of
claims 1 to 15 to protect a light source from

environmental influences.
