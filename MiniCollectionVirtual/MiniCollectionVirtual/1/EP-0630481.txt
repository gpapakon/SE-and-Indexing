<ABSTRACT>
A neurography system (10) is disclosed for generating diagnostically useful images of neural tissue (i.e. neurograms) employing a modified magnetic resonance imaging system (14). In one embodiment, the neurography system selectively images neural tissue by employing one or more gradients to discriminate diffusion anisotropy in the tissue and further enhances the image by suppressing the contribution of fat to the image. The neurography system is part of a broader medical system (12), which may include an auxiliary data collection system (22), diagnostic system (24), therapeutic system (26), surgical system (28), and training system (30). These various systems are all constructed to take advantage of the information provided by the neurography system regarding neural networks, which information was heretofore unavailable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is based upon an earlier filed U.K Patent Application
No. 9301268.0, filed January 22, 1993, which, in turn, is a continuation-in-part of
U.K. Patent Application No. 9216383.1, filed July 31, 1992, which, in turn, is a
continuation-in-part of U.K. Patent Application No. 9210810.9, filed May 21, 1992,
which, in turn, is a continuation-in-part of U.K. Patent Application No. 9209648.6,
filed May 5, 1992, which, in turn, is a continuation-in-part of U.K. Patent Application
No. 9207013.5, filed March 30, 1992, which, in turn, is a continuation-in-part of U.K.
Patent Application No. 9205541.7, filed March 13, 1992, which, in turn, is a
continuation-in-part of parent U.K. Patent Application No. 9205058.2, filed March 9,
1992.The present invention relates generally to the field of imaging and, more
particularly, to the imaging of nerve tissue.Although many techniques have been developed for locating and viewing the
brain, spinal cord, and spinal roots within the spinal canal, hitherto there has not been
a successful method for viewing the peripheral. autonomic, and cranial nerves. These
nerves, collectively referred to herein as peripheral nerves, commonly travel through
and along bone, muscle, lymphatics, tendons, ligaments, intermuscular septa, 
collections of fatty tissues, air and fluid spaces, veins, arteries, joints, skin, mucous
membranes and other tissues. The relatively small size of peripheral nerves, as well as
their close proximity to other tissue of comparable size and shape, makes them
difficult to locate and identify.The examination of peripheral nerves is further complicated by the complexity
of many such neural structures, such as the brachial plexus, lumbar plexus, and sacral
plexus. These structures include bundles of nerves that may join together, separate,
rejoin, intermix, and resegregate, forming intricate three dimensional patterns. A
compression or irritation of a small area of nerve within such a plexus (e.g. in the
shoulder) can cause pain, numbness, weakness or paralysis at some distant site (e.g. in
one finger). Even when a surgeon attempts to expose the plexus for direct inspection,
the anatomic complexity can prove overwhelming, rendering diagnosis inconclusive
and surgery difficult and dangerous.Radiologic methods employing, for example, X-rays, have been developed to
generate tissue specific images of various physiological structures including bone,
blood vessels, lymphatics, the gastrointestinal tract, and the tissues of the central
nervous system. Due in part

A method of utilizing magnetic resonance to determine the
shape and position of peripheral nerves, which method includes the

steps of:

(a) exposing an 
in vivo
 region of a subject to a magnetic
polarising field, the 
in vivo
 region including non-neural tissue and a
peripheral nerve;
(b) exposing the 
in vivo
 region to an electromagnetic
excitation field;
(c) producing an output indicative of the 
in vivo
 region's
response to the polarizing and excitation fields; and
(d) processing the output to generate a data set of signal
intensities describing the shape and position of at least one peripheral

nerve that is within the 
in vivo
 region; and in which method

(i) the 
in vivo
 region is exposed to an
electromagnetic pulse sequence for fat suppression prior to exposing the


in vivo
 region to a spin echo magnetic resonance imaging sequence; and
(ii) the steps of exposing the 
in vivo
 region to a
magnetic polarizing field and exposing the 
in vivo
 region to an
electromagnetic excitation field are supplemented with the step of

exposing the 
in vivo
 region to an electromagnetic pulse that establishes a
diffusional gradient in the polarizing field, with the diffusional gradient

being in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to a peripheral
nerve that is within the 
in vivo
 region.
The method of Claim 1 further characterized in that the steps
of exposing the 
in vivo
 region to a magnetic polarizing field and an 
electromagnetic excitation field is further supplemented by exposing the 
in
vivo
 region to an electromagnetic pulse that establishes a diffusional
gradient in the polarizing field, with the diffusional gradient being in a

direction that is substantially parallel to the peripheral nerve; the step of
producing an output indicative of the 
in vivo
 region's resonant response to
the polarizing and excitation fields includes producing an output indicative

of the 
in vivo
 region's response to the diffusional gradient in the
polarizing field that is in a direction substantially parallel to the

peripheral nerve;

the step of processing the output to generate a data set describing
the shape and position of the peripheral nerve includes the step of

generating a data set for the output that is indicative of the 
in vivo

region's resonant response to the diffusional gradient in the polarizing
field that is substantially parallel to the peripheral nerve and further

includes subtracting the data set from the data set that corresponds to the
diffusional gradient that is substantially perpendicular to the peripheral

nerve to produce a resultant data set that provides an image of the
peripheral nerve that is further isolated from portions of the 
in vivo
 region
that surround the peripheral nerve.
A method of utilising magnetic resonance to determine the shape
and position of peripheral nerves, which method includes the steps

of:

(a) exposing an in vivo region of a subject to a magnetic
polarizing field, the in vivo region including non-neural tissue and a

peripheral nerve;
(b) exposing the in vivo region to an electromagnetic excitation
field; 
(c) producing an output indicative of the in vivo region's
response to the polarizing and excitation fields; and
(d) processing the output to generate a data set of signal

nerve that is within the in vivo region; and in which method

(i) the in vivo region is exposed to an electromagnetic pulse
sequence for fat suppression prior to exposing the in vivo region to a spin

echo magnetic resonance imaging sequence;
(ii) the steps of exposing the in vivo region to a magnetic
polarizing field and exposing the in vivo region to an electromagnetic

excitation field are supplemented with the step of exposing the in vivo
region to at least three gradient pulses that establish diffusional gradients

in the polarizing field along at least three different directions;
(iii) the step of producing an output indicative of the in vivo
region's resonant response to the polarizing and excitation fields includes

sensing the resonant response of the in vivo region to the plurality of the
gradient pulses to produce an output for each gradient pulse;
(iv) the step of processing the output to generate a data set
describing the shape and position of the peripheral nerve includes the

steps of determining diffusional coefficients for each output and selecting
the two outputs having the maximum and minimum values of diffusional

coefficients; and
(v) the step of processing the output to generate a data set
consists of generating a first data set from the output having the maximum

value of diffusional coefficient, generating a second data set from the
output having the minimum value of diffusional coefficient and

subtracting the second data set from the first data set to produce the
resulting data set.
