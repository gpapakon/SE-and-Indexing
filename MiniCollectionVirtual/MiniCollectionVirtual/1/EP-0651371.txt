<ABSTRACT>
The vibration absorber for damping structural sound has a waveguide made of mass-spring elements arranged one above another in layers in the wave propagation direction. The mass-spring elements are designed as bending beams or bending plates having a spring stiffness which decreases in the wave propagation direction and which are connected to one another in a force-transmitting and/or torque-transmitting manner via spacers arranged offset from one another in such a manner that when pressure or tension is applied to these mass-spring elements, bending occurs within at least one mass-spring element.

<CLAIMS>
Vibration absorber for the damping of structure-borne
sound, having a waveguide which has, in the direction of

wave travel, a layer sequence of mass-spring elements,
characterised in that the mass-spring elements are in the

form of bending bars or bending plates (...2) which have
spring rigidity decreasing in the direction of wave travel

and which are so connected to one another in a force-locking
and/or moment-locking manner by means of spacers (..3)

arranged in an offset manner relative to one another, that,
if pressure or tension is applied to them, deformation

occurs inside at least one mass-spring element.
Vibration absorber according to claim 1, characterised
in that at least one spacer of each mass-spring element is

arranged between two spacers of the adjacent mass-spring
element.
Vibration absorber according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that flexible regions (33, 43), on each of which

a respective spacer (33.1, 43.1) is arranged, are formed
inside a mass-spring element (32, 42) by indentations or the

tapering of material.
Vibration absorber according to any one of claims 1 to
3, characterised in that a spacer (13, 23) is in the form of

a spot weld connection.
Vibration absorber according to any one of claims 1 to
4, characterised in that the waveguide has a non-reflecting

termination (14, 74, 104). 
Vibration absorber according to any one of claims 1 to
5, characterised in that the outer wall region of the

waveguide is surrounded by a damping mass (24).
Vibration absorber according to any one of claims 1 to
6, characterised in that additional springing (56) and/or a

damping mass (64, 94) is arranged between the mass-spring
elements.
