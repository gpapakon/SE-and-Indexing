<ABSTRACT>
In a memory system including a memory cell array (305), a row 
decoder (301) and a column decoder (303), a first shift register (302) 

receives a first value outputted from said row decoder, to output a first 
shifted value obtained by shifting said first value, to said memory cell 

array for access to said memory cell array, and a second shift register 
(304) receiving a second value outputted from said column decoder, to 

output a second shifted value obtained by shifting said second value, to 
said memory cell array for access to said memory cell array. A shift 

control logic (414, 415) responds to advance of said program and an 
branch instruction for controlling the shift of said first and second shift 

registers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a memory system as indicated in the preambles of claims 1 or 5 and as eg known from US-A-4 819 213, and more
specifically to a memory system including an instruction memory, for use
in a RISC (reduced instruction set computer) type microprocessor having
a highly pipelined architecture.Rapid advancement of a VLSI (very large scaled integrated circuit)
technology and a design technique has resulted in a remarkable
development of microprocessors whose performance continues to elevate
and approach a superminicomputer. One of the performance elevating
technologies includes a so called RISC type microprocessor, which is
characterized in that, instructions that are included in an instruction set
used in conventional computers and that have a high use frequency, are
realized in the form of hardware for the purpose of increasing the
precessing speed.For example, N. P. Jouppi, "The Nonuniform Distribution of
Instruction-Level and Machine Parallelism and Its Effect on
Performance", IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol. 38, No. 12, 
December 1989, pp1645-1658, defines a superscalar system and a
superpipelined system for elevating the performance of the RISC
microprocessor, as follows:Referring to Figure 1A, there is shown a pipelined structure of a
basic RISC processor, which has four stages called "Instruction Fetch"
(IF), "Decode" (D), "Execute" (EX) and "Write Back" (WB),
respectively. In the stage "IF", an instruction code is read from an
instruction cache memory, and in the stage "D", the fetched instruction
code is decoded, and necessary register files are read. In the stage "EX",
an arithmetic or logic operation is performed on contents read out of the
register files, and in the stage "WB", the result of arithmetic or logic
operation is written back to a register file. The operation is advanced by
one pipelined stage in each one clock cycle, so that one instruction can be
executed in each one clock cycle.The superscalar system is featured in that "N" processor units are
provided so that "N" instructions can be simultaneously executed (where
"N" is an integer not less than 2). Figure 1B illustrates the superscalar
system of N=2, so that two instructions are executed in each one clock
cycle.On the other hand, the superpipelined system is realized by
subdividing the basic pipelined system shown in Figure 1A by "M" (where
"M" is an integer not less than 2) and shortening the period of each clock
cycle to one-divided-by-"M", so that the instructions can be executed at a
speed which
