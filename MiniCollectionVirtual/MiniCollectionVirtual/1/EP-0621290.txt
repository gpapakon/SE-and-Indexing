<ABSTRACT>
This invention is an emulsion polymer for use as a redispersible pressure 
sensitive adhesive and a process for making the emulsion polymer. The polymer 

is the emulsion polymerization reaction product of one or more neutralized 
ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid monomers, one or more alkyl acrylates 

or methacrylates, and optionally, one or more vinyl containing monomers. The 
carboxylic acid functionality is either neutralized before initiation of 

polymerization, concurrently with the polymerization, or partially before and 
partially during polymerization. The polymerization occurs in the presence of 

a polyalkylene oxide plasticizer, having a molecular weight greater than 3000. 
In other embodiments, the invention is the water redispersible pressure sensitive 

adhesive made with the polymer, and a repulpable substrate made with the polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for making pressure sensitive adhesives 
that are used on paper products and that are redispersible in water when the 
paper products are recycled and repulped. During the recycling of paper products or tapes that contain pressure 
sensitive adhesives, the paper is slurried into water with heating and stirring 
to cause the paper to disintegrate into its component fibers. If an insoluble 
or a non-redispersible adhesive is present, the paper fibers will break away from 
the adhesive and the adhesive will mass into large lumps and films that 
eventually show up in the reformed paper as blotches and irregularities. As a 
result, the reformed paper has a non-uniform appearance and texture, and the 
blotches of adhesive cause ink to bleed and run on the reprinted page. Water-soluble 
pressure sensitive adhesives, which are removed with the waste water in 
the repulping process, have been developed to correct this problem, but in turn 
present other problems. Many pressure sensitive adhesive polymers are synthesized from insoluble 
acrylate and methacrylate monomers, which are known to give good adhesive 
properties. In order to make these polymers water soluble, relatively high 
levels of carboxylic acid are incorporated into the polymeric chain. The high 
level of acid needed to make the polymer water soluble also increases the 
humidity sensitivity of the adhesive, and this sensitivity ultimately leads to 
failure of the adhesive. In addition, although neutralization of the carboxylic 
acid functionality of these polymers is known to enhance solubility, 
neutralization can result in an unwanted increase in viscosity during the 
solution polymerization if the carboxylic acid monomers are neutralized before 
polymerization is initiated. It is also known that higher molecular weight 
polymers give better cohesive properties than lower molecular weight polymers, 
but higher molecular weight polymers also may cause an unwanted increase in 
viscosity. Thus, for practical purposes, in solution polymerization processes 
neutralization typically is performed after polymerization, and the molecular 
weight is controlled to avoid viscosity increases.  It has now been discovered that emulsions of redispersible pressure 
sensitive adhesives can be made that avoid the disadvantages associated with 
pressure sensitive adhesive solutions. The polymers of these emulsions can be 
synthesized with lower levels of carboxylic acid than have previously been needed 
for solubility, thereby
