<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a holder for a powered medical
instrument
and a powered medical instrument assembly
and, in particular, to an instrument holder which
allows for easy sterilization of the instrument and holder between uses.Instrument holders have been used in the fields of medicine and
dentistry for many years and are well known to practitioners. These holders
provide a location for instruments to be placed and stored when they are not
in use. Examples of such holders are taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,904,841 and
4,330,281.U.S. Patent No. 3,904,841 is directed to a holder for a powered
handpiece which provides means for interrupting the power to the handpiece
and also includes a lockout feature for selectively maintaining the
interruption of power while the handpiece remains removed from the
holder.U.S. Patent No. 4,330,281 teaches an improved dental handpiece holder
which grips the handpiece at the region of the grip portion adjacent to the
tailstock portion and is provided with a plurality of supporting surfaces
which differ from the conventional holding receptacle for improving the use
of the instrument. While the aforementioned patents may improve the ease of use and
accessibility of the instrument, there is an important problem which is not
addressed by these, or any other, patents. This problem arises due to the fact
that medical and dental instruments become directly, or indirectly,
contaminated with blood and other bodily fluids during dental procedures,
causing the instrument holder to become contaminated. Thus, if the
instrument holder is not properly sterilized between patients, it is possible to
transmit serious diseases from one patient to another by way of a
contaminated instrument holder. This may happen if a dental instrument is
used on an infected patient and is returned to the instrument holder. If the
instrument holder becomes contaminated, it may serve as a reservoir of an
infectious pathogen. Therefore, if the instrument holder itself is not
sufficiently sterilized between patients, any instrument inserted into the
holder will be contaminated, even if the instrument itself has been properly
sterilized between patient uses, and may infect subsequent patients.Awareness of these conditions has been heightened recently with
reports of HIV transmission in the dental operatory. With the realization
that HIV (the virus which causes the deadly AIDS disease) or potentially
deadly diseases, including viral hepatitis and tuberculosis, can be transmitted
in the dental

the second section (14) can be separated from the first section (16)
without use of tools for sterilization of said supporting means (18); and
when the first (16) and second (14) sections are coupled together, energy
from the power supply (27) is transferred via said first (16) and second (14)

section in use to the powered medical instrument (20) for operating the powered
medical instrument (20);

characterised in that physical separation of the first (16) and second (14)
sections disconnects the second section (14) and thus in use the powered medical

operation to disconnect the power supply (27).
The assembly of claim 1 wherein the first section (16) has a contact (76;
78) which physically contacts a contact (66; 64) of the second section (14)

when the first (16) and second (14) sections are coupled together and energy is
supplied in use to operate the powered medical instrument (20) via the physically 

contacting contacts (76, 66; 78, 64) and wherein the physical separation of the
first (16) and second (14) sections breaks the physical contact between the

contacts (76, 66; 78, 64) and thereby disconnects the second section (14) from

the power supply (27).
The assembly of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein said first section (16)
further comprises a channel (42) for receiving said support (12) and means (40)

for holding said support (12) in position within said channel (42).
The assembly of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said first section (16)
includes a flange (30) and said second section (14) includes a channel (46)

corresponding to said flange (30) such that said flange (30) co-operates with
said channel (46) to releasably couple said first section (16) and said second

section (14).
The assembly of claim 4, wherein said flange (30) contains a lug (34)
and said channel (46) contains an aperture (50) corresponding to said lug (34)

such that when said first (16) and second (14) sections are coupled together,
said lug (34) co-operates with said aperture (50) to hold said first (16) and

second (14) sections together.
