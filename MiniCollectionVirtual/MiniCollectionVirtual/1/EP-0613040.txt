<ABSTRACT>
A photographic camera (1) comprises a chamber (25) for 
receiving a cartridge (1) containing a filmstrip (5), a film 

exposing gate, and movable blocking means (45) for sealing a 
film passage to the exposing gate which must be moved out 

of the way to permit a filmstrip from a cartridge in the 
chamber to be advanced to the exposing gate. The 

blocking (45) means is positioned inside the chamber over a 
film egress opening to the film passage to be moved to 

uncover the film egress opening by a cartridge during 
insertion of the cartridge into the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of 
photography, and in particular to a photographic camera 
with an interior dust seal. U.S. Pat. No. 5,142,316, issued Sep. 26, 1989, 
discloses a photographic camera comprising a loading 
chamber for receiving a 35mm cartridge containing a 
filmstrip, a film exposing gate, and movable light-blocking 
means for normally sealing a narrow film passage 
connecting the chamber and the exposing gate but which 
can be moved out of the way to permit the leading end of 
a filmstrip from a cartridge in the chamber to be 
advanced to the exposing gate. The light-blocking means 
is a pair of elastic members positioned within the narrow 
film passage in urged contact with each other to be 
pushed aside by the leading end of the filmstrip when the 
filmstrip is advanced from the cartridge. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,437, it is taught that 
the leading end of a filmstrip advanced from a cartridge 
in the chamber is the preferred element for opening the 
light-blocking means to permit film access to the film 
exposing gate. A problem may occur, however, in that the 
filmstrip may not have sufficient longitudinal rigidity 
to force the leading end to push aside the elastic 
members. Consequently, a film jam can result. According to the invention, a photographic 
camera comprising a chamber for receiving a cartridge 
containing a filmstrip, a film exposing gate, and 
blocking means which must be moved out of the way to 
permit a filmstrip from a cartridge in the chamber to be 
advanced to the film exposing gate, is characterized in 
that:
 
 
   said blocking means includes movable means for 
being moved to move the blocking means out of the way 
responsive only to insertion of a cartridge into the 
chamber. More particularly, a photographic camera 
comprising a chamber for receiving a cartridge containing 
a filmstrip, a film exposing gate, and movable blocking 
means for sealing a film passage to the exposing gate 
which must be moved out of the way to permit a filmstrip 
from a cartridge in the chamber to be advanced to the 
exposing gate, is characterized in that:
 
   said blocking means is positioned inside the 
chamber over a film egress opening to the film passage to 
be moved to uncover the film egress opening by a 
cartridge during insertion of the cartridge into the 
chamber, whereby a filmstrip from the cartridge can be 
advanced through the film egress opening to the film 
passage. FIG. 1 is rear perspective view of a

<CLAIMS>
A photographic camera comprising a chamber 
for receiving a cartridge containing a filmstrip, a film 

exposing gate, and movable blocking means for sealing a 
film passage to said exposing gate which must be moved 

out of the way to permit a filmstrip from a cartridge in 
said chamber to be advanced to the exposing gate, is 

characterized in that: 
   said blocking means is positioned inside said 

chamber over a film egress opening to said film passage 
to be moved to uncover said film egress opening by a 

cartridge during insertion of the cartridge into the 
chamber, whereby a filmstrip from the cartridge can be 

advanced through said film egress opening to said film 
passage. 
A photographic camera comprising a chamber 
for receiving a cartridge containing a filmstrip, a film 

exposing gate, and blocking means which must be moved out 
of the way to permit a filmstrip from a cartridge in said 

chamber to be advanced to said film exposing gate, is 
characterized in that: 

   said blocking means includes movable means for 
being moved to move the blocking means out of the way 

responsive only to insertion of a cartridge into said 
chamber and without the filmstrip being advanced from the 

cartridge. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
2, wherein said moveable means is positioned inside said 

chamber to be moved to move said blocking means out of 
the way by a cartridge during insertion of the cartridge 

into the chamber. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 
3, wherein a film passage extends between said chamber 

and said exposing gate, and said blocking means is 
positioned inside said chamber over a film egress opening 

to said film passage to block entry to the film passage 
from the chamber but is movable to uncover said film 

egress opening to permit entry to the film passage. 
A photographic camera as recited in claim 4 
wherein said blocking means and said movable means are at 

least one integrally formed elastic flap.
