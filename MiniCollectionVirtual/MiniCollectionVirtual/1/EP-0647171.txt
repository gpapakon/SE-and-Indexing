<DESCRIPTION>
 AN ABRASIVE FLUID JET CUTTING COMPOSITION AND METHODField of the InventionThe invention generally relates to material finishing and cutting compositions and processes. More specifically, the invention relates to compositions and methods useful in removal of reactive and non-reactive materials from substrates through the application of abrasive fluids.Background of the InventionAbrasive fluid or water jet cutting has been used for some time in applications limited to cutting material where damage to the surrounding substrate from heat, vibration, and other products of conventional cutting methods cannot be tolerated.For example, Yie, U. S. Patent No. 4,478,368, discloses a slurry water jet process for cutting steel and concrete. Further, I. M. Hutchings, Mechanisms of the Erosion of Metals by Solid Particles, Erosion: Prevention and Useful Applications, ASTM STP 664, W. F. Adler Ed., American Society For Testing Materials, 1979 pp. 59-76, discloses experiments that illustrate the behavior of spherical and angular particles on oblique impact with a metal surface. R. H. Hollinger et al, Precision Cutting with a Low Pressure, Coherent Abrasive Suspension Jet, 5th American Water Jet Conference, pp. 245-252, Aug. 29-31, 1989: Toronto, Canada, disclose conventional water/abrasive jet cutting using entrained abrasive particles in a water jet.H. Y. Li et al, Investigation of Forces Exerted by an Abrasive Water Jet on a Workpiece, 5th American Water Jet Conference, pp. 69-77, Aug. 29-31, 1989: Toronto, Canada, disclose the development of practical procedures for the measurement of forces exerted on a workpiece in the impingement zone. K. F. Neusen et al, Impact of Liguid Jets at Velocities Approaching Liguid Sound 

Speed, Journal of Florida Engineering, Transactions of the ASME, pp. 198-202, September 1974, disclose experiments to obtain information concerning the action of high velocity liquid jets impacting at velocities that erode the target surface.M. Hashish, Steel Cutting with Abrasive Waterjets, Sixth Intl. Symposium on Jet Cutting Technology, April 6-8, 1982, pp. 465-487, discloses steel cutting with high velocity abrasive waterjets. Also, M. Hashish, On the Modeling of Abrasive-Waterjet Cutting, Seventh Intl. Symposium on Jet Cutting Technology, June 26-28, 1984, pp. 249-265, discloses an effort to model the abrasive- waterjet cutting processes by visualization of the cutting interface and an analysis of the erosion process by abrasive-waterjets.
