<ABSTRACT>
An agricultural communications network including a 
master system which polls lower level systems for digital 

maps, each map comprising field character information 
indicative of a feature at each location of a farmer's 

field. An agronomist can correlate the data of the digital 
maps to ascertain common conditions which realize maximum 

yields. Farmers and their regional dealers participate in 
the system through subscription. Anonymity is maintained 

through hierarchy such that the farmers will participate in 
the network, thus expanding the data base for use by the 

agronomist. Thus, the participating subscribers facilitate 
expansion of the field of agronomy for the benefit of all.

<DESCRIPTION>
Cross reference is made to a related invention 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,220,876 entitled Variable Rate 
Application System, the subject matter of which is owned by 
the present applicant and the teachings of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. The present invention relates generally to a 
communication network for electronically routing 
agricultural information, and more particularly to an 
apparatus and method for routing and analyzing agricultural 
information stored in the form of digital maps, wherein 
each digital map stores field character information 
indicative of a feature of each location of a field such as 
current fertilizer levels, soil type, soil history, yield 
data and the like. Agronomy is a branch of agriculture dealing with 
field-crop production and soil management. One of the 
principle duties of an agronomist is to help a farmer 
ascertain the ideal combination of fertilizers in view of 
the various soil characteristics to help maximize the yield 
of a particular crop. Different fields are conducive to 
raising different crops, and the notion that any field is 
ideal for raising any crop is a misperception. As taught in applicant's related invention disclosed 
in U.S. Patent 5,220,876, the teachings of which are 
incorporated herein by reference, each location of an 
agricultural field is unique. For instance, each 
particular location within a field has a particular soil 
type, a present level of various fertilizers, a particular 
topology, field history etc. Thus, these various variables 
need to be taken into account when one determines the 
prescription for application of a blend of fertilizers for 
a particular type of crop to be farmed in each field. The 
recommended blend of fertilizers to be applied to the  
 
various locations in the field is usually determined by an 
agronomist known as a soil scientist, who is one skilled in 
the area of agronomy, and preferably, has an advanced 
degree such as a PHD. A soil scientist typically ascertains field-crop 
production and soil management information through the 
implementation of closed environment studies. Namely, 
raising crops in a controlled environment, such as a 
greenhouse, and then detailing his findings in the form of 
charts, graphs etc. Larger data bases can be created 
indicating the preferred soil conditions and environments 
for particular types of crops to maximize yield. This 
prior art method for obtaining this information is limited 
in two ways. First, the closed environment is only a 
simulated
