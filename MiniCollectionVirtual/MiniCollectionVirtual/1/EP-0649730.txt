The invention relates to a method for feeding a belt 
strip to a rotating building drum. The invention further 
relates to a belt strip feeding apparatus for feeding a belt 
strip to a rotating building drum. The method and apparatus according to the invention 
can especially be applied in the manufacture of 
pneumatic tyres, nowadays mainly radial tyres, for vehicles. 
In the manufacture of these tyres, strips of flexible 
material are mounted onto a building drum to build a 
belt for the pneumatic tyre on the building drum. In general, 
such a strip will be elongated and have two long 
and two short circumferential sides. A method for feeding a belt strip to a rotating building 
drum is known from e.g. US-A-4 608 890, said 
method comprising the steps of: 
a) unwinding belt material having opposite longitudinal 
sides from a supply reel, b) conveying the belt material in a direction of conveyance 
at a velocity of conveyance from the supply 
reel to a fixing element by conveying means, said 
longitudinal sides of the belt material being substantially 
parallel to the direction of conveyance, 
said conveying means comprising a first conveyor, c) cutting the belt material into a belt strip by cutting 
means placed above the conveying means, said 
belt strip being elongated and having two long circumferential 
sides and two short circumferential 
sides, said belt strip comprising: 
a central rectangular part having two long sides 
and an imaginary centre line, the direction of 
conveyance of the first conveyor being parallel 
to the imaginary centre line, a triangular leading end, situated downstream, 
the one short, leading circumferential side of 
the strip being formed by the hypotenuse of the 
leading end and a short side of the leading end 
lying in the extension of one of the long sides of 
the central part, the hypotenuse and the short 
side of the leading end enclose an acute angle 
and the one long side of the central part and 
the short side of the leading end forming the 
one long circumferential side of the strip, a triangular trailing end, situated upstream, the 
other short, trailing circumferential side of the 
strip being formed by the hypotenuse of the 
trailing end and a short side of the trailing end 
lying in the extension of the other side of the 
central part, the hypotenuse and the short side 
of the trailing end enclosing an acute angle and 
the other long side of the central part and the 
short side of the trailing end forming the other
