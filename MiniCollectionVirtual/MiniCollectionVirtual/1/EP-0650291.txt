<ABSTRACT>
A color image processing apparatus is 
rendered capable, in case of output of a color image, 

displayed for example on a color display, by an output 
device such as a hard copying device, of judging the 

color reproduction range of each output device with a 
limited memory capacity, by defining the color 

reproduction range of each output device by the 
interior of a hexahedron on a uniform color space 

(L*, a*, b*) and judging whether the input image 
signal Q is present inside the hexahedron by the 

product of the input image signal with an internal 
point P with respect to each plane (i) constituting 

the hexahedron.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing method for processing the color space of
image data according to the color reproducing region of
the image output apparatus, and an apparatus adapted for
executing such image processing method.With the extensive spreading of personal
computers and the similar equipment in recent years,
there are increasing the opportunities of preparing or
processing a color image on the computer, and observing
the image on the color display or releasing the prepared
image on paper by the hard copying apparatus or ink jet
printer.In such case, the color reproducing ability
varies depending on the image output device (for example
hard copying apparatus or ink jet printer), and there
is therefore no guarantee that the color observed on
the monitor is faithfully reproduced on the hard copy.
In particular, as the color reproduction range of the
hard copying device is generally narrower than that of
the color monitor, the color which can be represented
on the monitor but is outside the color reproduction 
range of the hard copying device cannot, in most cases,
be reproduced on the hard copy.For avoiding such drawback, there can be
conceived a method, for example, of preparing a
look-up table by predetermining, for all the combinations
of color signals of the color image, whether
they belong to the color reproduction range of the
image output device and providing an alarm in case the
entered color signal is outside the color reproduction
range.Such method is however associated with a
drawback that a very large memory capacity is required
for such look-up table because the number of combinations
of the color signals is enormous. The required
memory capacity becomes even larger in case plural
image output devices are employed, as the look-up table
has to be prepared for each of such image output
devices.Also as already mentioned above, the color
reproducing ability of the color hard copy varies
depending on the system used. For example, while the
silver halide photography can reproduce the image to a
maximum density of about 2.0, the color copying machine
can only reproduce the image to a maximum density of
about 1.8.Consequently, when a silver halide-based
photograph is copied on a color copying machine, the 
high density areas of the photograph become saturated,
so that the information originally contained in the
image becomes eventually lost partially.Stated differently, when an original image, of
which information overflows the color reproduction
range of the image output
