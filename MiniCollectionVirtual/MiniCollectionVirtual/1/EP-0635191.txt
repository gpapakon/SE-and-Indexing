<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of effecting automatic callback in a mobile telecommunication system. A calling subscriber (A1) is permanently connected to a public switched telephone network (PSTN) and a called subscriber (B2) is a mobile unit which moves in the public land mobile network (PLMN). A centrally located home location register (HLR) keeps an account of where all mobiles registered in the mobile telecommunication network are located, with the aid of local databases, so-called visitor location registers (VLR). The calling subscriber (A1) calls the called subscriber (B1) and finds that the subscriber is busy. The calling subscriber (A1) then dials a code, wherewith a reference (CRefi) is stored in a queue (10) in the home location register (HLR), this queue relating to the called subscriber (B1). When the called subscriber (B1) is free to receive a call, the calling subscriber (A1) is informed to this effect. The calling subscriber (A1) then lifts his telephone receiver and a connection is set-up between the two subscribers. When the called subscriber (B1) answers, the call is considered to have been connected. The home location register (HLR) then removes the reference (CRefi) from the queue (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of completing
a telephone call from a calling subscriber to a
called subscriber when the called subscriber does not
answer the call. The subscribers are part of a telecommunication
system which includes at least one
cellular mobile telecommunication network. One of the
subscribers is connected via the mobile telecommunication
network and the other subscriber is connected via
the mobile telecommunication network or via a public
switched telephone network. The called subscriber is
permanently registered in a home location register and
temporarily registered in a visitor location register
which is known to the home location register and
incorporated in the mobile network.Present-day mobile telephony is a rapidly growing
technology. Many mobile telecommunication systems,
among them the European GSM-system, have already
passed through the first basic development phase and
the system designers are now concentrating on further
improvements to the systems, among other things with
regard to system refinement and the introduction of
optional services. The land-bound public switched
telephone network has long included optional services
such as "automatic callback when the called subscriber
is busy with another call" or "automatic callback when
the called subscriber does not answer". This known
technique is based on a database in which the identities
of the subscribers involved are established in
connection with a telephone exchange which handles a
calling subscriber and/or a called subscriber. The
problem with transferring this technique to a mobile 
telecommunication system is that the subscribers are
mobile in the system. Since a mobile subscriber often
moves geographically in the telecommunication network
or system, difficulties are encountered in locating
the subscriber when it becomes possible to set-up a
call connection, particularly when a long time has
passed between initiating the "automatic callback
service" and the execution of this service. Services
of this nature are also found in certain mobile telecommunication
systems. For instance, an automatic
callback service is known to the art from Japanese
Patent Specification JP 3-190,494. According to this
known method, the identity numbers of both a calling
and a called subscriber are stored in a memory location
while waiting for the called subscriber to become
available to receive the call. When the subscriber is
available, a call connection is set-up with the aid of
data taken from the memory location. The

telecommunication system comprising a public switched

telephone network (PSTN) and a public land mobile
network (PLMN), said two networks being mutually

linked by a gateway mobile services switching centre
(GMSC) and in which mobile telecommunication system a

calling subscriber (A1), the so-called A-subscriber,
is connected to a local exchange (LE) in the public

switched telephone network (PSTN) and where a called
subscriber (B1), the so-called B-subscriber, is a

mobile unit which is able to communicate via a local
mobile services switching centre (MSC) in the public

land mobile network (PLMN), and where the B-subscriber
is permanently registered in a home location register

(HLR) and temporarily registered in a visitor location
register (VLR) known by the home location register,

said visitor location register belonging to the local
mobile services switching centre (MSC), said method

comprising the following steps:

the A-subscriber (A1) calls the B-subscriber (B1);
the A-subscriber (A1) is informed that the B-subscriber
(B1) is "not available", the

method being characterized in that it comprises the further steps:
the A-subscriber (A1) dials a code requesting a
service "complete telephone call";
a "complete call" message (1) is sent from the
local exchange (LE) to the home location register

(HLR);
the "complete call" message initiates the insertion
of a reference (CRefi) at the bottom of a queue (10)

in the home location register (HLR), said queue belonging
to the B-subscriber (B1) and containing references

of attempts made by different subscribers to be
connected to the B-subscriber;
the home location register (HLR) diverts the "complete
call" message (1) to the visitor location register

(VLR) ; 
the visitor location register (VLR) registers the
"complete call" message (1) and sends a confirmation

message (2) "complete call confirmed" to the home
location register (HLR);
the home location register (HLR) sends the confirmation
message (2) "complete call confirmed" to the

local exchange (LE) together with the reference (CRefi);
the A-subscriber (A1) is informed of the confirmation
(2), whereafter the A-subscriber releases the

connection to the local exchange (LE);
the B-subscriber becomes free to accept calls;
- a message (3) "B-free" is sent from the visitor

location register (VLR) to the home location register
(HLR);
the home location register (HLR) confirms the "B-free"
message (3) by sending a confirmation message

(4) "B-free confirmed" to the visitor location register
(VLR);
the reference (CRefi) positioned at the top of the
queue (10) is sent from the home location register

(HLR) to the local exchange (LE) together with the "B-free"
message (3), and the A-subscriber (A1) is then

informed that the B-subscriber (B1) is free;
a call connection is established with the aid of an
initial address message (IAM1) when the A-subscriber

(A1) is free, wherein the reference (CRefi) accompanies
the initial address message from the local exchange

(LE) to the gateway mobile services switching
centre (GSMC) and from there to the local mobile

services switching centre (MSC), whereafter the reference
is forwarded to the visitor location register

(VLR);
the B-subscriber (B1) answers the call;
the visitor location register (VLR) sends a message
(5) "B has answered" to the home loc
ation register
(HLR) together with the reference (CRefi); and
the home location register (HLR) removes the reference
(CRefi) from the queue (10).

call" message (21) and sends a confirmation message

(22) "complete call confirmed" to the home location
register (HLR) together with a reference

(MRefi);
the reference (MRefi) is stored in a memory location
(11) in the home location register (HLR), this

memory location belonging to the A-subscriber (A2) and 
containing references for connection attempts to

different subscribers from the A-subscriber;
the home location register (HLR) diverts the confirmation
