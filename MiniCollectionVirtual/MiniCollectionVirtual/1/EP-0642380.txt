<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for the admixture of and/or for the achievement of and/or the facilitation of the reduction of undesired compounds, such as soot, hydrocarbons and the oxides of nitrogen and, if the fuel contains other substances, such as sulphur and chlorine, and metal compounds such as mercury and arsenic, for bringing about a reduction in emissions of acidifiying oxides of sulphur and hydrogen chloride, as well as mercury and arsenic compounds, etc., for example in an incineration unit (1
<
n
>
). In accordance with the invention, this is achieved by a special admixture and mixing process, in which suitable reducing agents for nitrogen compounds and/or for other undesired substances, for example oxides of sulphur, are introduced into the incineration unit in direct association with the combustion zone (4
<
n
>
) in conjunction with the supply of gas. This can take place in conjunction with the actual incineration process, or separately from it. The invention also proposes that the utilization of the admixture and mixing process in conjunction with the supply of air (2) or some other suitable gas and/or gas-borne powder or aerosol compound (5) in itself should lead to the formation of low levels of the oxides of nitrogen, but that is does permit the utilization of other processis, either alone or in combination with this process. The invention also relates to an arrangement for the execution of the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Reducing proceeding and/or a system to intermix and means for the sameThe present invention relates to an admixture and mixing process in an incineration unit intended to bring about the reduction of contaminating substances such as soot, hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and, if the fuel contains other substances such as sulphur and chlorine, and metal compounds such as mercury and arsenic, also to bring about a reduction in emissions of acidifying oxides of sulphur and hydrogen chloride, as well as mercury and arsenic compounds, etc., in accordance with the introduction to Patent Claim 1.OVER FIRE AIR (OFA)The prior art includes the so-called OFA method, the principle of which is based on the supply of a proportion of the necessary combustion air to the combustion process via separate air ducts at a later point in time situated after the combustion zone, resulting in the following positive effects:A) Causes fuel-rich/sub-stoichiometric combustion to take place in the hearth and counteracts the oxidation of the nitrogen present in the air and in the fuel.B) Causes a lowering of the maximum temperature in the core zones of the flame, resulting in lower N0X production. The problems associated with the OFA admixture of "cold" combustion air are: to cause the combustion air to take part in combustion, to obtain a final product, of combustion, and to keep emissions of, amongst other things, dust, soot and CO at a low level. In view of this, the OFA method has only been applied to large incineration units which are run under low load conditions.ROTATING OVER FIRE AIR (ROFA)The prior art in respect of the reduction of 

nitrogen in incineration units also includes the so-called ROFA method, which produces the following effects:A) NO, reduction through an increased degree of rotation and turbulence in the flame of the unit. B) Increased efficiency from a lower flue-gas temperature and the necessary lower excess air.Flue-gas recyclingThe prior art also includes the recycling of the flue-gas into the primary combustion zone and the flame. This method has been found in certain cases to produce a good reduction in NOx, which can be explained by a reduced oxygen content and an associate-^ reduction in the intensity of combustion.The negative effects associated with flue-gas recycling are, in the first place, of a practical nature, for example the possibility of condensation associated with corrosion, toxicity in the event of leakage, increased flue- gas flow and a resulting reduction in incineration capacity,
