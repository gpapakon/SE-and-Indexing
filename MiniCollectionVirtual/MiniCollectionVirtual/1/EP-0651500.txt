<ABSTRACT>
An op-amp comprising a single gain stage amplifier cascaded with a buffer and an output 
stage. The buffer comprises an amplifier which isolates the gain stage from the output stage to 

prevent loading of the gain stage and create a more linear op-amp. For frequency compensation, 
the op-amp utilizes MOSFETs connected in a reversed biased configuration as load compensation 

capacitors. This technique reduces the non-linear effects of MOSFET gate capacitors utilized 
in conventional Miller compensation schemes and allows for digital fabrication technology of low 

distortion, low power supply operational amplifier design.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to operational amplifiers (op-amps) and, more particularly, 
to low distortion operational amplifiers operating from a low voltage power supply. Audio chips presently enable personal computers (PCs), compact disk (CD) players, and 
other portable audio devices to execute high quality audio applications. Typical audio chips 
comprise digital circuitry which occupies approximately 75-80% of the audio chip's silicon space 
and analog circuitry which occupies the remaining 20-25%. Typically, the analog circuitry 
comprises an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, digital-to-analog (D/A) converter and some 
output amplifiers. Its main function is to convert an analog input into a digital format suitable 
for the digital circuitry to process, then convert the digital signals back into an analog format 
suitable to drive an output device, such as a speaker. The digital circuitry occupies the majority 
of the silicon area and typically performs digital signal processing, such as filtering, noise 
shaping, and synthesizing, on the converted analog signals. The main function of these audio 
chips is to implement an entire audio system on one piece of silicon. The conventional analog circuitry utilized to implement high quality audio chips 
comprises an op-amp having: 1) two gain stages; 2) a highlylinear Miller compensation 
capacitor positioned between the two gain stages; and 3) an output stage connected to the output  
 
of the second gain stage. The output stage loads (i.e., draws excessive current from) the second 
gain stage and, therefore, two gain stages are required to achieve acceptable gain from the op-amp. 
The Miller frequency compensation capacitor must be connected between the two gain 
stages to ensure that the op-amp receives sufficient frequency compensation to produce a linear 
output having an acceptable level of harmonic distortion. Unfortunately, the position of the Miller compensation capacitor between the two gain 
stages precludes its implementation using a metal-oxide-silicon field-effect transistor (i.e., 
MOSFET) connected as a capacitor (i.e., a MOSFET gate capacitor). That is, implementing 
the Miller compensation capacitor with a MOSFET gate capacitor is undesirable because its 
connection between the gain stages would cause it to forward bias as its gate voltage approached 
and exceeded the threshold voltage, resulting in the capacitance of the MOSFET gate capacitor 
becoming highly non-linear. As the capacitance of the MOSFET gate capacitor becomes 
incre
