quinacridone pigments comprising 


(a) heating, at a temperature of about 80°C to about 145°C, a reaction 
mixture comprising 


(i) 2,5-dianilinoterephthalic acid or a 2,5-dianilinoterephthalic 
acid derivative having one or more substituents in at least 

one aniline ring, 
(ii) about 2 to about 10 parts by weight, relative to component 
(i), of a strong acid, and 
(iii) at least about 0.4 mole percent, relative to component (i), of 
iron in the form of an iron salt; 
(b) drowning the reaction mixture from step (a) by adding said 
reaction mixture to about 3 to about 15 parts by weight, relative to 

component (i), of a liquid in which the pigment is substantially 
insoluble; 
(c) isolating the quinacridone pigment; and 
(d) optionally, conditioning the quinacridone pigment.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of
quinacridone pigments having reduced particle size and improved
coloristic properties. In particular, the particle size of the typical
unsubstituted quinacridone is reduced by about 30% by the addition of
certain iron salts to the ring closure melt during pigment synthesis and
before the drowning process. The resultant beta-phase quinacridones
have characteristically deeper masstone, increased transparency, and
bluer undertone (tint) hue.Processes for the preparation of quinacridones are well known and
documented. For example, S.S. Labana and L.L. Labana, "Quinacridones,"
Chemical Reviews, 67, 1-18 (1967), and U.S. Patents
3,157,659, 3,256,285, and 3,317,539. The quinacridones thus obtained,
known as crude quinacridones, are generally unsuitable for use as
pigments and must undergo one or more additional finishing steps to
modify the particle size, particle shape, or crystal structure to achieve
pigmentary quality.A preferred method for preparing quinacridones involves thermally
inducing ring closure of 2,5-dianilinoterephthalic acid intermediates, as
well as known aniline-substituted derivatives thereof, in the presence of
polyphosphoric acid, such as described in U.S. Patent 3,257,405. After
ring closure is completed, the melt is drowned by pouring into a liquid in
which the quinacridone is substantially insoluble, usually water or an
alcohol. The resultant crystalline pigment that is then further conditioned
by solvent treatment or milling in combination with solvent treatment.Final particle size of quinacridone pigments is controlled by the
methods used both in synthesis and in aftertreatment. Quinacridone
pigments can be made more transparent by reducing the particle size or 
more opaque by increasing the particle size. Particle size is most often
controlled during precipitation of the pigment by drowning or during
subsequent milling of the crude pigment. Tinctorial strength and transparency
of pigments can also be affected by solvent treatment.Quinacridones and quinacridone solid solutions disclosed in the
prior art are also sensitive to numerous other process variables, such as
the type of drowning solvent, the temperature of the drowning solvent,
the type of agitation used during the drowning process, the duration of
the drowning process, and the post-drown processes. These variables
are known to affect crystal phase, particle size and distribution, and
surface characteristics, all of which ultimately affect the pigment color
properties
