<ABSTRACT>
An extractable support device comprising a drawer housing (1) equipped with a handle (12) having two arms (15) each mounted so as to rotate about a spindle (16) and together occupying a first position in which they extend substantially parallel to a face of the drawer housing and a second position in which they extend substantially perpendicularly to the said face of the drawer housing, the drawer housing being intended to be inserted in a slot housing (2), characterised in that each arm (15) of the handle has a free end (18) configured to come to bear against the slot housing when the said arm is displaced between its first position and its second position, so as to move the drawer housing with respect to the slot housing by a cam effect.

Removable support apparatus for electronic equipment, the 
apparatus including a drawer (1) received in a cradle (2), the drawer 

being equipped with a handle (12) having two arms (15), each of which 
is rotatably mounted about an axis (16), the two arms together taking 

up a first position in which they extend substantially parallel to 
one face (17) of the drawer and a second position in which they 

extend substantially perpendicular to said face of the drawer, the 
drawer being designed to be inserted into the cradle (2), each arm 

(15) of the handle having a free end (18) organized to bear against 
the cradle while said arm is being displaced between its first 

position and its second position, so as to displace the drawer 
relative to the cradle by means of a cam effect, in which apparatus 

the drawer (1) is equipped with a first electrical connector (13) 
designed to co-operate electrically with a second electrical 

connector (23) provided on the cradle (2), said first electrical 
connector and said second electrical connector being organized to be 

insertable one into the other, and means (14, 24) being provided for 
locking said first electrical connector and said second electrical 

connector together in the inserted position, when the drawer is 
inserted in the cradle, the means for locking the connectors together 

in the inserted position comprising a catch (24) rotatably mounted 
about an axis (25) that is secured to the cradle (2), said catch 

being resiliently urged into a notch (14) provided on the drawer (1), 
said apparatus being characterized in that it includes an unlocking 

member (28) slidably mounted inside the cradle, and organized to 
rotate said catch (24) about its axis so as to release it from the 

notch (14), said unlocking member being disposed inside the cradle sc 
as to slide under the effect of a thrust force exerted by the free 

end (18) of one arm (15) of the handle while said arm is being 
displaced between its first position and its second position, the 

displacement in translation of the unlocking member being limited by 
an abutment (22) that is secured to the cradle. 
The apparatus according to claim 1, in which a spring (26) is 
provided to oppose the displacement in translation of the unlocking 

member relative to the cradle.  
 
The apparatus according to claim 2, in which the spring (26) is 
mounted 
on the axis (25) of the catch.
