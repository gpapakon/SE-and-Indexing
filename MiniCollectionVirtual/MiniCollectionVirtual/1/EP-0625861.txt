<ABSTRACT>
A spatial light modulator 1 of the LCD type comprises picture elements 
20, 21 arranged as rows extending horizontally and columns extending 

vertically. The picture elements are arranged in groups such that the 
picture elements of each group are substantially contiguous with each 

other in the horizontal direction. It is thus possible to provide 
continuous horizontal parallax of the 2D views and an increased number 

of such 2D views, for instance by converting to directional information 
by means of a lenticular screen 6.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a spatial light modulator and to a directional
display.Such a display may be used to provide three dimensional (3D) displays.EP-A-0 387 033 and EP-A-0 400 992 disclose frame thinning out systems in which
the pixels of a display are grouped into multiple groups, each of which is composed of a
plurality of pixels which are contiguous to each other. The number of pixels which are
turned on in a frame time period within an integration period is selected in accordance
with gradation data. The frame period during which the number of pixels turned on is
kept constant is set sufficiently short so as to not cause flicker.A known 3D display comprises a lenticular screen disposed on the surface of a thin
film transistor twisted nematic liquid crystal display. The pitch of the lenticular screen is
substantially equal to an integer multiple of the horizontal pitch of the picture elements
(pixels) of the liquid crystal display. The pixels are arranged in rows and columns and
the display is addressed so that each vertical row of pixels behind respective lenticules of
the lenticular screen contains information representing a two dimensional (2D) view of
an object. The lenticular screen allows each of the 2D views to be replayed in the
appropriate direction so as to give the appearance of a 3D image.Known types of liquid crystal display (LCD) have a number of disadvantages
which degrade the quality of a 3D image produced in this way. Firstly, the resolution of
thin film transistor twisted nematic LCDs is limited by the thin film transistor response,
by the addressing schemes, and by low production yields. This results in a limitation in
the number of views which can be obtained while maintaining an adequate horizontal
resolution in each of the 2D images.Secondly, the use of thin film transistors at each pixel requires the use of a black 
mask which prevents light from passing through the transistors. The black mask extends
between adjacent columns of pixels and is imaged by the lenticular screen to give a
region of no information in the image between adjacent 2D views. Thus, the output of
the 3D display does not have continuous parallax.The use of a lenticular screen comprising elongate cylindrically converging
lenticules results in information in one direction only i.e. horizontally, being decoded as
directional information. The horizontal resolution of the LCD dictates the number of 2D
views which can be displayed. However, in general, the horizontal and vertical pixel
resolutions of
