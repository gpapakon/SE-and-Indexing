<ABSTRACT>
To provide a water- and oil-repellent agent which, 
when it is used to treat natural fibers such as cotton 

and silk, does not damage the feeling of the fibers and 
does shown an excellent continuation property of water-and 

oil-repellency effect. 
A fluorine system water- and oil-repellent agent 
comprising, as a main component, units derived from a 

copolymer comprising polyfluoro-oxyalkyl-containing 
(meth)acrylate and units derived
 from a dicarboxylic 
acid anhydride-containing (meth)acrylate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluorine system water-and
oil-repellent agent that can give an excellent
water- and oil-repellent property to fibers, especially
natural fibers such as cotton or silk etc.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,540,497, 4,566,981, 4,426,466,
and 4,468,527 describe fluorine system water- and oil-repellent
agents comprising, as a main component, units
derived from a perfluoro-oxyalkyl-containing
(meth)acrylate. However, these water- and oil-repellent
agents give a poor continuation property of
water- and oil-repellency effect, and have a poor
water- and oil-repellency-giving effect to a
hydrophilic fiber such as cotton or silk.U.S. Patent No. 4,215,205 describes fluorine
system water- and oil-repellent agents comprising a
perfluorooxyalkyl-containing (meth)acrylate added with
carbodiimide. However, although this water- and oil-repellent
agent has a better water- and oil-repellency-giving
effect to hydrophilic fibers, it is not yet
sufficient, and this agent gives a poor continuation
property of water- and oil-repellency effect.Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No.
5-222149 describes a water-repellent composition
comprising a copolymer of at least three monomers
comprising polyfluoroalkyl-containing (meth)acrylate,
urethane bond containing poly(meth)acrylate, and
blocked isocyanate containing (meth)acrylate, and
blocked polyisocyanate compound. However, since this
composition uses a blocked isocyanate, and this has a 
decomposition temperature of not less than 120Â°C, so
that this composition must be treated at a high
temperature, which often injures fibers, this
composition can substantially not be used. Further,
since this composition also has a high possibility of
damaging feeling of fibers, it cannot be used as a
fiber treating agent.Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 58-17513
discloses that a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and
4-methacryloxy ethyl trimellitic acid can be an
excellent adhesive for teeth. This document, however,
does not describe to use 4-methacryloxy ethyl
trimellitic acid for water- and oil-repellent agents,
or to copolymerize it with polyfluoroalkyl-containing
(meth)acrylate.An object of this invention is to provide a water-and
oil-repellent agent which, when it is used to treat
fibers, especially natural fibers such as cotton and
silk, does not damage the feeling of the fibers and
does show an excellent continuation property of water-and
oil-repellency effect.This invention is a fluorine system water- and
oil-repellent agent comprising, as a main
