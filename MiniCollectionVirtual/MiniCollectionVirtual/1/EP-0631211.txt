<ABSTRACT>
The gear (1) to be finished is rotated in mesh with the honing tool (3) which is in the form of an internal gear with abrasive teeth which remove metal from the workpiece gear during rotation. The spindle drives of the workpiece gear and the honing tool are electronically coupled. Before machining takes place, the honing tool is rotated in mesh with the workpiece gear, which is allowed to rotate freely under no load. The deviations from true angular displacement of the workpiece gear are registered by the control system. The electronic coupling is then engaged and during machining uses the stored information on the gear errors to modify the relative speeds in a way that varies the metal removal rate and corrects the overall pitch error of the gear.

Method of finishing gear-tooth systems on a
machine tool, the gear (1) to be machined rotating

about its rotation axis (2) and being in engagement
with an abrasive tool (3) which rotates about its

rotation axis (4), as a result of which chip removal
occurs at the tooth flanks of the gear (1) which are to

be machined, and the rotary movement of the rotation
axis (2) of the gear (1) and the rotary movement of the

rotation axis (4) of the abrasive tool (3) being
electronically coupled, characterized in that the

machining comprises the following working steps:

a)

(i) rotation of the gear (1) by at least one
complete revolution about its rotation axis,
(ii) in the course of which it is in engagement
with the abrasive tool (3),
(iii) the abrasive tool (3) rotating with the gear
(1) in such a way as to be free of load but in

contact with the tooth flanks of the gear (1),
and
(iv) in the course of which, over the complete
revolution of the gear (1), the rotary

deviations, resulting from existing gear-tooth
errors, from the ideal rotation between gear

(1) and abrasive tool (3) are measured and
stored;
b)

(i) machining of the gear (1) with the abrasive
tool (3), 
(ii) the rotary movement of the rotation axis (2)
of the gear (1) and the rotary movement of the

rotation axis (4) of the abrasive tool (3) now
being electronically coupled, and
(iii) the electronic control, during the coupling of
the two rotation axes (2, 4), taking into

account the rotary deviations measured and
stored in working step a) in such a way that

these rotary deviations are in each case added
with reversed sign in a corresponding manner

during the setpoint selection for an angular
position of the rotation axis to be regulated.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the machining is extended by a measurement being

carried out again in accordance with working step a)
according to Claim 1 following the machining in

accordance with working step b) according to Claim 1,
and by the machining being continued without correction

of the angular positions when the measured rotary
deviations from the ideal rotation fall below a

predetermined maximum value, but otherwise the
machining is continued in accordance with working step

b) according to Claim 1, in which case the rotary
deviations measured again are preferably taken as a

basis.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in
that, in the event of the measured rotary deviations

not falling below the predetermined maximum value, the
method according to Claim 2 is repeated until this is

the case.
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized
in that the correction of the angular positions of the

rotation axis to be regulated is restricted to those
angular ranges within which the measured deviation from

the ideal rotation exceeds a fixed value.
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that, to carry out the working step a)

according to Claim 1, the abrasive tool (3) is rotated,
in the course of which it is in engagement with the 

gear (1), and the gear (1) rotates with the abrasive
tool (3) in such a way as to be free of load but in

contact with the tooth flanks of the abrasive tool (3).
Method according to at least one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the gear-tooth errors which are

present in the abrasive tool (3) and which are
preferably separately determined on a measuring machine

are taken into account in accordance with the working
step b) (iii) according to Claim 1 when calculating the

corrected angular position and also during the rotary
coupling without correction values.
