<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention seeks to adjust the power level of a radio 
frequency transmitter and relates more particularly to an amplifier comprising a detector circuit for power 
measurement. In radio frequency transmission systems, it is usual to adjust the transmitter power 
level. The power level control means typically includes a detector for providing a 
voltage proportional to the output voltage of the transmitter power amplifier. In U.S. Patent 4,602,218 issued July 22, 1986 to Vilmur et al., entitled 
"Automatic Output Control Circuitry For RF Power Amplifiers With Wide Dynamic 
Range", automatic power output control circuitry is disclosed in which the 
magnitude of a radio frequency signal is maintained at one of a plurality of 
magnitudes selected in response to control signals. The radio frequency signal 
output from a variable output amplifier is sampled and the sample is further 
amplified and the dynamic range compressed prior to being rectified. The rectified 
power magnitude signal, which is nonlinearly related to the radio frequency signal 
magnitude, is adjusted by an adjustment factor selected by the control signals and 
employed in varying the output of the variable output amplifier to produce a 
corresponding radio frequency signal output magnitude. U.S. Patent 5,109,538 issued April 28, 1992 to Ikonen et al. entitled "Circuitry For 
Widening The Effective Range Of A Transmitter" describes circuitry for widening 
the power control range of radio telephone. A radio frequency signal is amplified 
in a controllable power amplifier. After the amplifier a controllable switch is 
connected, which, while in a first state, does not substantially attenuate the RF 
power emitted transmitted from the power amplifier. The first power control range 
of the transmitter is thus produced. When the switch is in a second state, it 
directs part of the RF power transmitted from the power amplifier to a resistive 
element and permits part of the RF power to be transmitted to the output of the  
 
transmitter. A second power control range is produced in this manner. U.S. Patent 3,697,857 issued October 10, 1972 to El-Banna entitled "Power 
Supply And Control Circuit" discloses a power supply and control circuit for 
providing a high voltage DC output from a low voltage DC source, i.e., a DC 
battery, especially useful for solid state transmitters. The source is connected 
across the input and a second source is connected between one terminal of the 
first source and a corresponding terminal of the input,
