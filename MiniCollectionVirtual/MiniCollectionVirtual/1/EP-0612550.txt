<ABSTRACT>
A filter material for filtering leucocytes 
from a fraction of or whole human blood, comprises a 

textile web having a thickness of between about 2 
millimeters to about 12 millimeters and a bulk density 

of about 0.05 to 0.4 g/cm³. The web has a plurality of 
interlocked textile fibers (5) with average deniers 

between about 0.05 and 0.75 and average lengths between 
about 3 millimeters and 15 millimeters. The textile 

fibers are distributed in the web to form a matrix 
thereof with spaces between adjacent interstices of 

interlocked fibers. A plurality of fibrillated 
particles (10) of textile fiber material, having a 

surface area of between 5 and 100 square meters per gram 
are disposed within the spaces of the matrix. The 

weight ratio of the fibrillated particles (10) to the 
textile fibers (5) is between about 1:99 and 40:60. A 

plurality of glass fibers (8), having an average 
diameter of between 0.1 and 5 microns and being about 2% 

to 85% of the web, also form part of the matrix. A 
thermoplastic binder (4) is disposed at least at 

cross-over portions (9) of the matrix textile fibers (5) 
and matrix glass fibers (8), with the amount of the 

binder being about 0.1% to 20% by weight of the web.

<DESCRIPTION>
WO-A-9 301 880 discloses a blood filter 
and method of filtration for removal of leucocytes from 
whole blood or blood fractions. The filter material is 
a shape-sustaining laid textile web having a thickness 
of at least about 1 millimeter and a bulk density of 
between about 0.05 and 0.4 g/cm3. The web has a 
plurality of interlocked, textile fibers with average 
deniers between about 0.05 and 0.75 denier (1 denier = 1/9 
tex) and average lengths 
between about 3 millimeters and 15 millimeters. The 
textile fibers are substantially uniformly distributed 
in the web so as to form a matrix of the fibers with 
spaces between interstices of the interlocked fibers. 
Within those spaces are disposed a plurality of 
fibrillated particles of polymeric material having a 
surface area of between about 5 and 60 square meters per 
gram. The fibrillated particles have a plurality of 
fine fibrils which are interlocked with adjacent textile 
fibers such that the fibrillated particles are not 
substantially displaceable from the web during 
filtration of blood. The weight ratio of fibrillated 
particles to textile fibers is between about 1:99 and 
40:60. As disclosed in WO-A-9 301 880, for 
efficient and effective depletion of leucocytes from  
 
blood passing through the filter material, both the 
fiber geometry and the surface area of the fibers are 
important, and that, very importantly, the surface area 
must be significantly greater than the usual prior art 
blood filters, since otherwise the degree of leucocyte 
removal is not sufficient. Further, since fiber 
geometry and surface area are important for leucocyte 
depletion, the depth (thickness) of the filter material 
is also important. Somewhat similarly, since the bulk 
density of the filter material and the denier of fibers 
affects fiber geometry and surface area, these are also 
important. However, to achieve the high surface area of 
the filter material required for effective leucocyte 
removal from blood, a critical component is that of the 
very high surface area fibrillated particles in the 
filter material. Ordinary textile fibers cannot provide 
such high surface areas to the filter material which 
surface area is required for high leucocyte removal. 
The fibrillated particles are somewhat elongated 
particles with an elongated central portion from which 
radiate a large number of fibrils. Generally speaking, 
a typical particle has an overall length of less than 
1000 micrometers, e.g. 5-300 micrometers, and a width and depth 
of from about 0.1
