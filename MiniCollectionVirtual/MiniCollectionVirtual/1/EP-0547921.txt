<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet 
recording apparatus for recording onto a recording 
sheet by discharging the ink thereto, and more 
particularly to an ink jet recording apparatus and 
method with the improvement of selecting the driving 
voltage optimal for the discharge heater provided in 
the recording head, or capable of achieving the proper 
recording in accordance with the number of used ink 
tanks. Today, a wide variety of information recording 
apparatuses such as printers, facsimiles and word 
processors have been developed. As one of the 
recording methods for such recording apparatuses, an 
ink jet method has been widely used owing to its 
advantages such as high resolution, high speed 
recording, low cost, and compact size. Among them, 
the compact size of the apparatus and the reduction 
in running cost are important factors. In a conventional ink jet recording apparatus, 
there is mounted an ink jet head unit 701 consisting 
of an ink discharge port 702, and a substrate 703 
having signal contacts 704 and heater voltage ID 
circuits 705 as shown in Fig. 1.  
 The heater voltage for determining the ink 
discharge rate is selected from four stages of heater 
voltage to compensate for the dispersion on production 
in heater resistances of the ink jet head unit 701. 
The selection of the heater voltage can be performed 
by a combination of cutting the four wiring patterns 
706 for heater voltage ID circuit 705. An ink jet 
recording apparatus selects a heater voltage optimal 
for a recording head exchanged from the four stages 
of heater voltages by a combination of cutting the 
wiring patterns 706 provided thereon, and supplies it 
to the recording head. In such an ink jet recording head, however, 
owing to the necessity of a substrate 703 having signal 
contacts 704 and heater voltage ID circuits 705, it is 
required to make the substrate 703 as small as 
possible to achieve a compact head. Also, it was requisite to cut the wiring 
patterns 706 by measuring the dispersion in heater 
resistances for each recording head at the production, 
and selecting the optimal heater voltage on the basis 
of its measurement result. On the other hand, the form of an ink tank 
supplied with the above-described recording head is that 
in which the tank is formed integrally with the  
 
recording head so to be detachable as a unit from the 
apparatus. Alternatively the tank may also be detachable 
by itself from the recording head. In cartridges for ink jet printers in which ink can 
be refilled
