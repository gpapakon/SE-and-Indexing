<ABSTRACT>
In a process for treating waste paper for paper making, using a common process water (PW), in which process, firstly, in a first partial process, the waste paper is disintegrated to form an aqueous fibre suspension by means of a first process water partial flow (PW1) and printing ink present on the waste paper is dissolved by means of the addition of de-inking chemicals (DIC) to form a suspension and is dispersed as printing ink particles, and then, in a second partial process, the suspension is diluted by means of a second process water partial flow (PW2) and the printing ink particles subsequently removed, at least partially, from the suspension by means of flotation, an improved whiteness of the end product is achieved in a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way by using a water having a water hardness of at least 5@dH as process water (PW), and by distinctly reducing the water hardness (WH) of the water of the first process water partial flow (PW1), used in the first partial process, by means of a water treatment.
