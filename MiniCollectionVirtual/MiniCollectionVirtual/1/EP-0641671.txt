<ABSTRACT>
The Invention provides :
 

   Sheets (1,3) for forming patterns (5) on an 
ink receiving flexible sheet (9,11) having an ink-receiving 

layer (9) containing at least an inorganic 
compound selected from the group consisting of metallic 

powder and metallic oxide powder and mixtures thereof, an 
organic binder and a glass frit, and the ink-receiving 

layer being formed on the surface of an adhesive layer 
(11) 
said pattern-forming sheets
 uniformly containing an 
ink (3) comprising a pigment, a glass frit, and an 

organic binder on or in a substrate (1), 
wherein
 the 
glass frit contained in the ink (3) and the glass frit 

contained in the ink-receiving layer can soften or melt 
at a same temperature range. 
The invention also provides a method for 
forming and fixing a pattern using said pattern-forming 

sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sheets for
forming patterns, and ribbons for printing and ink ribbon
cartridges produced using said sheets, and methods for
forming and fixing patterns using them.In the technical area requiring the fixing of
such formed patterns by firing as glazing on porcelain,
circuit patterns on thick film hybrid integrated circuits,
patterns as electrodes, resistances, dielectrics or the
like on electronic parts and the like, methods for
formation and fixing of patterns have been heretofore
carried out which comprise preparing a pasty ink from a
mixture of a pigment, a material for a conductor,
resistance, dielectric or the like, a glass frit and a
binder, printing a pattern on a substrate with the pasty
ink by screen-printing or other technique, and firing the
printed pattern. However, the screen-printing technique,
although suitable for mass-producing a single kind of 
product, has the problems of being time-consuming and
costly in preparation from a block copy to a screen, hence
low in productive efficiency. With this drawback, the
technique is not suited to multikind and small-quantity
production, testing of products and the like. Known
methods for transfer of patterns to substrates include
direct printing methods, methods able to transfer the
printed patterns on transfer paper by water slide transfer
technique or other means and so on. Yet these methods
have posed the problems of difficulties in printing on a
curved surface, automation of printing, etc.To overcome the foregoing problems, we have
attempted to practice a method in which patterns are
depicted with XY plotter or the like over carbon paper or
to use various printers, currently in wide use, capable of
forming the desired patterns by dotting. However, the
carbon paper used under the plotter and the ribbons for
printing for use in the printers have the following
fundamental drawbacks.Known sheets for forming patterns such as carbon
paper, ribbons for printing or the like include, for
example, those prepared by kneading and dispersing wax, a
binder, a pigment of each color such as carbon black and
the like to give a paste and coating a film of
polyethylene terephthalate or other material with the 
paste or impregnating the paste into cloth, etc. Since
the sheets of this type are intended for exclusive use in
printing or transfer of patterns, the sheets when used for
said method involving the firing at about 300 to about
1400°C cause the patterns formed thereon to burn out or to
change the properties, failing to provide

<CLAIMS>
Use of a pattern-forming sheet for forming
a pattern on an ink-receiving flexible sheet, wherein :


the pattern-forming sheet comprises a
substrate and an ink uniformly distributed on the surface

and/or the interior of said substrate, said ink
comprising an inorganic compound selected from the group

consisting of inorganic pigments metallic powders and
metallic oxide powders, and a glass frit ; and
the ink-receiving flexible sheet has an
ink-receiving layer

formed on the surface of an adhesive layer, wherein said
ink-receiving layer contains at least an inorganic

compound selected from the group consisting of metallic
compounds and metallic oxide powder or mixtures thereof, and

a glass frit; wherein said ink is transferred from the pattern-forming
sheet to said ink-receiving layer.
The use of claim 1 wherein the ink and/or
the ink-receiving layer further comprises an organic

binder.
The use of any of claims 1 or 2 wherein the
ink has been applied to or impregnated into the

substrate.
The use of any of claims 1 to 3 wherein the
pattern-forming sheet is cut to a specific width into a

ribbon.
The use of claim 4, wherein said ribbon is
accommodated into a casing to form an ink ribbon

cartridge.
A method for forming and fixing a pattern
on an object comprising the steps of :


i) placing the pattern-forming sheet, the
ribbon or the ink ribbon cartridge as defined in any of

claims 1 to 5, onto an ink-receiving flexible sheet as
defined in claims 1 or 2,
ii) transferring the ink from the pattern-forming
sheet to the surface of the ink-receiving layer, 
iii) placing the ink-receiving flexible sheet
on the object, and
iv) firing the ink-receiving flexible sheet to
thereby fix the formed pattern on the object.
A method for forming and fixing a pattern
on an object comprising the steps of :


i) transferring the ink from the the pattern-forming
sheet, the ribbon or the ink ribbon cartridge as

defined in any of claims 1 to 5, onto a transfer paper,
ii) transferring the ink from the transfer
paper to the ink-receiving flexible sheet as defined in

any of claims 1 or 2,
iii) placing the ink-receiving flexible sheet
on the object, and
iv) firing the ink-receiving flexible sheet to
thereby fix the formed pattern on the object.
A method according to any of claims 6 or 7
wherein the transfer is carried out by a thermal-transfer

type printer.
A method according to any of claims 6 or 7
wherein the transfer is carried out by impact type

printer or wire-dot type printer.
