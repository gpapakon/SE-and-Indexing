<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a design method for an automation system for automating an industrial installation (19). The design method comprises the following steps:   - prescription of at least one peripheral channel on a programming unit (1) by a user, - prescription of a fault behaviour, which is required in the event of the occurrence of a fault of the peripheral channel, at the programming unit (1) by the user, - knowledge-base-supported determination of at least one implementation of the peripheral channel with the required fault behaviour by means of the programming unit (1) and   - designing of the peripheral channel by the programming unit (1).

Computer-aided design method for a 
programmable automation system, in particular a memory-programmable 

control, to control and/or monitor a 
technical installation (19), 


which has at least the following components which 
can be connected to a central unit (15) so that 

they can communicate with it: 

at least one input module (16), 
at least one output module (17) and 
a programming unit (1) with a processor (2), a 
memory (4), at least one input unit (11, 12) and 

at least one output unit (13, 14), 
whereby by way of at least one input signal path 
electroconductively connected to the input module 

(16), signals can be transmitted to the central 
unit (15) from a transmitter (27) located in the 

technical installation (19) and 
whereby by way of at least one output signal path 
electroconductively connected to the output module 

(17) signals can be transmitted from the central 
unit (15) to an actuator (39) located in the 

technical installation (19), 
whereby the input signal path and the output 
signal path have an error behaviour in the event 

of error, 
 
characterized in that 


all realizations of a signal path in terms of 
circuit engineering and corresponding in each case 

with a certain error behaviour are stored together 
with the error behaviour in the memory (4), 
by means of the input unit (11, 12) at least one 
of the signal paths is selected, 
by means of the input unit (11, 12) for the 
selected signal path one of these error behaviours 

is selected,  
 
by means of the programming unit (1), from the 
realizations of a signal path stored in the memory 

(4), at least one realization of the selected 
signal path corresponding to the selected error 

behaviour is retrieved and 
by means of the output unit (13, 14) at least one 
realization of the selected signal path in terms 

of circuit engineering and corresponding to the 
selected error behaviour is emitted. 
Computer-aided design method according to 
claim 1, characterized in that the selectable error 

behaviour comprises errors to be detected and/or 
located. 
Computer-aided design method according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that several signal 

paths can be combined into one group and that the 
selection of the error behaviour and perhaps also the 

retrieval and the output of the realization only take 
place once. 
Computer-aided design method according to one 
of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that by means of the 

programming unit (1), from the realizations of a signal 
path stored in the memory (4) a list of permitted 

realizations of the selected signal path corresponding 
to the selected error behaviour is retrieved, whereby 

the permitted realizations can be emitted by means of 
the at least one output unit (13, 14).
