<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for regulating thermal processes, at least two process parameters being measured at least once by measuring devices within a time interval, in which a parameter variation which cannot be ignored for the process cycle occurs, the recorded parameters being fed to a regulating device, and the regulating device regulating the process parameters in the thermal process by means of quantities obtained from the measurements of the process parameters.

<CLAIMS>
Process for automatic control of thermal processes, whereby by measuring devices at 
least two process parameters are measured at least once during a time interval, within 

which a parameter change occurs, which is not negligible for the course of the process, 
the parameters recorded are supplied to a controlling device and the controling device 

controls the process by values, which habe been obtained from the measurement of the 
process parmeters, characterized in that the recorded values of the process parmeters 

are concentrated to classes by a classifier, which is installed within the control device 
and are combined to a situation actual value and a correlator installed within the control 

device correlates the situation actual value with a situation reference value. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that by comparative values, which are 
obtained by correlation of situation actual value and situation reference value, input 

values are controlled. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that groups of 
process parameters are combined to form separate situation actual values and that 

these values are correlated within the correlatur with situation reference values 
corresponding to the respective group. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in that the position of the 
measuring devices is adjusted depending on the measured parameter values.  

 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that as a process 
parameter the radical concentration is determined within discrete areas in the thermal 

process. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the temperature 
is determined within discrete areas in the thermal process. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the dust 
concentration is determined within discret areas in the thermal process. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the thermal 
process is an incineration. 
Process according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the thermal 
process is a gasification. 
Device for controling thermal processes embracing measuring devices for measuring 
process parameters in discrete time intervals and a controling device, characterized in 

that the controling device contains a classifier, which concentrates the recorded values to 
classes and combines the classes to a situation actual value and a correlator, which 

correlates the situation actual value formed with a situation reference value.
