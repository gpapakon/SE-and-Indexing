<ABSTRACT>
A camera has a camera body (100) and a viewing system 
disposed on the body. The viewing system has two framing 

conduits (128, 130) by which the user can properly frame an 
image to be captured. Each of the framing conduits has an 

image receiving aperture (140, 142) at one end and an image 
viewing aperture (116, 118) at the opposite end. The 

conduits are optically isolated from each other, in that an 
image entering the receiving aperture of one conduit cannot 

be viewed at the viewing aperture of the other conduit. The 
viewing conduits are preferably devoid of optical elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cameras, and specifically to a 
still photographic camera having dual viewfinders that are 
optically isolated from each other. Still photographic cameras conventionally include a 
viewfinder through which the user views the image to be 
captured by the camera (such as on conventional photographic 
film or on a solid-state image array such as a charge-coupled 
device, or CCD). Typically, a single viewfinder is used. That 
is, a single viewing aperture is provided on the rear of the 
camera. In cameras of the single lens reflex ("SLR") type, the 
single viewing aperture of the viewfinder is optically coupled 
to the camera's main lens (the lens that focuses the image for 
capture by the camera). Thus, the image to be captured is 
conducted to the viewing aperture of the viewfinder via the 
main lens. SLR cameras use a complex and precise mechanism to 
coordinate the viewing function of the viewfinder with the 
focusing function of the main lens -- the camera incorporates 
an optical mechanism that moves a mirror to redirect the image 
from the viewfinder to the image-capturing mechanism (film or 
solid-state array). An earlier and less complex system uses a 
single viewfinder that is optically isolated from the main 
lens. The viewfinder has an image-receiving aperture on the 
front of the camera that is separate from the main lens. The 
viewfinder simply allows the user to frame the image to be 
captured, while the focusing and aperture settings must be made 
by measurement or estimation rather than by eye (as in the 
SLR). When using a camera with a viewfinder having a single 
viewing aperture (whether SLR or otherwise), the user typically 
closes the eye not being used to view the image through the 
viewfinder. Some cameras (those of the rangefinder type)  
 
employ a viewfinder with two viewing apertures as part of a 
range-finding system to allow the user to more easily focus the 
camera. In such rangefinder cameras, the dual viewing 
apertures are optically coupled, the image's range or distance 
being determined by the parallax between the two image 
receiving apertures of the viewfinder. A camera intended for use by children should be rugged and 
relatively inexpensive. The delicate and expensive optics 
associated with the viewfinders of typical SLR or rangefinder 
cameras are therefore unsuitable for a child's camera. 
Instead, it is preferable to use a simpler viewfinder that 
requires few or no optical elements (optical elements being 
considered in this application
