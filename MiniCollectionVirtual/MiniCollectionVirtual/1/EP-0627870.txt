<ABSTRACT>
A method is proposed for controlling/regulating the converter valves of two or more load-commutated parallel resonant circuit invertors, which are fed from the same DC current source or DC voltage source and are series-connected on the DC side, having in each case an induction oven (furnace) with a compensation capacitor, a current flow being set, by triggering in each case two diagonally opposite converter valves of an invertor, from the DC current source or the DC voltage source with a series-connected inductor via the parallel resonant circuit connected to said invertor. The load phase angles (ss) of the parallel resonant circuit invertors are set in such a manner that, on the one hand, any predetermined individual powers (P1, P2) of the parallel resonant circuits (5, 9) result, the maximum power which can be output by the DC current source or the DC voltage source being taken into account, and that, on the other hand, the predetermined ratio between the individual powers (P1, P2) of the parallel resonant circuits (5, 9) is obtained. An intervention in the control/regulation of the DC current source or the DC voltage source is made only when one of the load phase angles (ss) to be set reaches the minimum value (ssM) which is a result in particular of the valve off-times, for the purpose of reducing the DC current (Id) or the DC voltage (U), while in the case of load phase angles, to be set, above the minimum value (ssM) the DC current source or the DC voltage source is operated in a fully driven manner.

A method for triggering/regulating
converter valves of two or more load-commutated parallel

resonant circuit converters which are supplied by a
common DC source or DC voltage source, are switched in

series on the DC side and comprise one induction furnace
each with a compensating capacitor, with a current flow

from the DC source or DC voltage source with a choke
connected in series being set through the parallel

resonant circuit which is connected to the inverted
rectifier by igniting two diagonally opposite converter

valves of an inverted rectifier, with the the load phase
angle (β) of the parallel resonant circuit converters

being set in such a way that on the one hand the randomly
predetermined individual outputs (P
1
, P
2
) of the parallel
resonant circuits (5, 9) are obtained, with the maximum

output as can be supplied from the DC source or the DC
voltage source being taken into account, and that on the

other hand the predetermined ratio between the individual
outputs (P
1
, P
2
) of the parallel resonant circuits (5, 9)
is achieved and that intervention in the

triggering/regulation of the DC source or DC voltage
source is only made when one of the load phase angles (β)

to be set reaches the minimum value (β
M
) which is caused
by the valve hold-off times in particular so as to reduce

the DC (I
d
) or the DC voltage (U), whereas the DC source
or DC voltage source is operated in a fully triggered

manner in the case of load phase angles to be set above
the minimum value (β
M
).
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that in the case of a supply with a DC source the

altered voltage (U') of the DC source is determined as an
auxiliary value from the sum total of the altered outputs 

(P
1
', P
2
') to be set and the constant current (I
d
), that
the altered impedance (Z
1
', Z
2
') of every single parallel
resonant circuit is determined from the altered voltage

(U') and the altered output (P
1
', P
2
') to be set of said
resonant circuit and that the load phase angles (β1',

β2') are determined from the determined altered
impedances (Z
1
', Z
2
').
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that in the case of a supply with a DC

voltage source with a choke connected in series the

2
