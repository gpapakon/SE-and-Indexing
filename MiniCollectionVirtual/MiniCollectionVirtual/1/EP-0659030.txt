<ABSTRACT>
As the front surface diaphragm of the speaker is 
provided with a first acoustic waveguide and the rear 

surface diaphragm is provided with a back cavity 
reflecting sound waves and a second acoustic waveguide 

guiding the reflected sound waves, a mass of air by the 
first acoustic waveguide will be applied to the front 

surface diaphragm, substantially the same load as to the 
front surface diaphragm will be able to be applied to the 

rear surface diaphragm, the acoustic loads in the front 
and rear of the diaphragm will be balanced, the sound waves 

of the low frequency ranges will be able to be efficiently 
discharged on substantially the same level from both 

acoustic waveguides and sounds having an expansion 
and presence will be able to be obtained. 
Further, as the front surface of the diaphragm 
of the speaker arranged in the the television set is 

provided with a first acoustic waveguide and the rear 
surface of the speaker diaphragm is provided with a second 

acoustic waveguide and the sound radiating mouth of the 
second acoustic waveguide is arranged, for example, on 

the top surface of the television set, the sound reproducing 
band will be able to be expanded by using the sounds of 

the front surface of the speaker diaphragm and the sounds 
of the rear surface with one speaker and television 

sounds having an expansion and presence will be able to be 
obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to speaker systems and
the same for television sets and more particularly to a
speaker system wherein acoustic waveguides guiding sound
waves are arranged respectively in front and rear of a
speaker diaphragm so that a reproducing band may be
expanded and a stereoscopic sound field may be reproduced
and such speaker system for television sets.A number of speaker systems for television sets have been proposed. For
example, US-2,825,419 describes a speaker having passages at the rear of the speaker
diaphragm so that the sound from the rear of the speaker can be radiated outward; the
passages being arranged to provide poor coupling of higher frequency sound and to
reduce internal resonances and reflections. EP-A-0,462,571 describes a speaker system
having a sealed enclosure at the rear of the speaker designed to enhance the acoustic
effect produced by the speaker. In EP-A-0,519,509 passages are provided at the front
and rear of a speaker to channel the sound to two ports at either side of the screen on the
front of the television set. The object of this arrangement is to provide an easily
mountable speaker system to reproduce ultra low frequency sound at high sound
pressure. Fig. 16 is a perspective view showing a
conventional sealed type speaker system. Fig. 17 shows
frequency characteristics of the same.In the speaker system shown in Fig. 16, a
speaker 1 is fixed to a box 2 so that, when an input
signal is applied to the speaker 1, the diaphragm 3 will
vibrate and sound waves will be radiated on the front
surface.In this case, the front of the diaphragm 3
will be a free space and the added mass applied to the
front portion of the diaphragm 3 will be determined by the
following formula: 
8/3 ρ a3
wherein ρ represents a density of air and a represents a
radius of the diaphragm 3.In the formation in Fig. 16, there have been
problems that, when the caliber is of a radius of about 12
cm., the added mass applied to the diaphragm 3 of the
speaker 1 will be so small that, in the conventional
sealed type speaker system, the limit of the reproduction
of the low frequency range will be determined by the size of
the speaker 1 and the inside volume of the box 2 and,
with a small slim box, the bass sound will be unable to be
well reproduced.In order to solve such problems, an acoustic
waveguide 13 having a mouth 14 smaller than the area
of a front surface diaphragm 12 is arranged on the front
surface of a speaker 11 as shown in Fig. 18. In this
formation, when the mass of air is applied on the
