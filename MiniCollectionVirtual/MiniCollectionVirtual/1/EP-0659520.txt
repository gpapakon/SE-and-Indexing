<ABSTRACT>
In a five-axis machine tool, the tool carrier (4) is pivotable about a pivot axis (7) which intersects a machining axis (5), around which a cutting tool (6) can be rotated, at an acute angle in the area of the latter. This angle of inclination is preferably between 30 DEG and 60 DEG , in particular around 45 DEG . Consequently, only slight compensating movements distributed over all axes are required during pivoting movements, yet the tool carrier (4) can be kept short so that deformations of the same remain small, which ensures high stability and permits great accuracy. In addition, large pivoting angles of 90 DEG  or more on both sides are possible without collision problems, which permits a large degree of adaptation of the position of the cutting edge to the workpiece surface and consequently high surface quality. Machine tools of the type described are especially suitable for milling turbine and power-plant blades as well as compressor impellers.

Machine tool having a workholder (10), and
having a toolholder (4) which can be pivoted about a

pivoting axis (7) and in which a milling tool which can
be rotated about a machining axis (5) is arranged, the

machining axis cutting the pivoting axis in the region
of the tip of the milling tool, the machining axis (5)

enclosing an angle (α) with the pivoting axis (7), and
drive means being provided with the aid of which the

pivoting axis and a rotation axis of a rotation station
in which the workpiece holder (10) is arranged can be

driven during machining, the movements of the axes
being performed in a programme-controlled fashion,

characterized in that the angle (α) is an acute angle.
