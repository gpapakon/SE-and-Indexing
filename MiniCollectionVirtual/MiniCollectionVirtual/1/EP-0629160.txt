Device (1) intended to be mounted on the chassis 
of a road haulage or handling vehicle (39), including 

handling and holding means for a container (29) including 

a bed (3) in the form of an elongate frame 
which can be fixed to the chassis of the vehicle (39), 

this bed (3) including two girders (5) which are intended 
to be arranged substantially in the direction of travel 

of the vehicle (39), front (7) and rear (9) ends intended 
to be arranged respectively towards the front and towards 

the rear of the vehicle (39), 
a tipper mechanism (17) including a rear end 
and mounted so that it can pivot about a first horizontal 

axle (33) perpendicular to the direction of travel of the 
vehicle, carried by the rear part of the bed (3) and a 

front end arranged in the direction of the front end (7) 
of the bed (3), 
a tipper arm (11) including a rear end mounted 
so that it can pivot about a second horizontal axle (35) 

parallel to the said first horizontal axle (33), this 
second horizontal axle (35) being carried by the front 

part of the tipper mechanism (17), and a front end 
arranged in the direction of the front end of the bed, 

this front end being fitted with means capable of 
grasping hold of a container in order to load it on to 

the vehicle (39) or in order to unload it therefrom, 
actuating means (15) capable of making the said 
tipper arm (11) pivot about the said first axle (33) or 

about the said second axle (35), 
grooved wheels (22) mounted on horizontal axles 

parallel to the said first horizontal axle (33), capable 
of guiding the chassis (31) of a container (29), and 

which support the lower face of this container (29) as 
the latter is loaded or unloaded from the vehicle (39), 
locking means (25) capable of fixing a 
container on the said device, 
 
characterized in that it includes coupling means (21) for 

a semitrailer consisting of a fifth wheel (21) capable of 
receiving the kingpin of a semitrailer, the said fifth  

 
wheel (21) being fixed on the tipper mechanism (17), the 

position of the said fifth wheel being such that it 
impedes neither the manoeuvres of a semitrailer (27) 

hitched to the said fifth wheel (21), nor the manoeuvres 
of a container (29) fixed above the said fifth wheel 

(21). 
Device (1) according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it further includes a means (37) capable of blocking 

the position of the tipper mechanism (17) with respect to 
the bed (3). 
Device (1) according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the said actuating means are 

hydraulic rams (15). 
Device (1) according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the said tipper arm (11) is a 

telescopic arm. 
Device (1) according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the said telescopic tipper arm (11) is equipped with 

a hydraulic ram. 
Device (1) according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the fifth wheel (21) 

includes a base (19) on which the upper part of the fifth 
wheel (21) is mounted in such a way that it can pivot 

about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the direction of 
travel of the vehicle (39), the device (1) being provided 

with means (23) capable of locking the base (19) of the 
fifth wheel (21) with respect to the bed (3) in such a 

way that when the device (1) is used to couple a 
semitrailer (27), these locking means (23) allow the 

stresses imposed on the base (19) of the fifth wheel (21) 
to be transmitted directly to the bed (3). 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the bed (3) includes 


a front part (7) towards the side of the bed 
(3) which is intended to be fixed towards the front of 

the chassis of the vehicle (39) capable of supporting the 
chassis (31) of a container (29) and 
a rear part (9) which is lowered with respect 
to the front part (7) in such a way that this lowered  

 
rear part (9) does not impede the manoeuvres of a 

semitrailer (27) which might be coupled to the fifth 
wheel (21), the rear part (9) of the device (1) including 

laterally on each side at least one support element (22) 
capable of supporting the rear part of the chassis (31) 

of the container (29) when this container (29) is loaded 
on to the vehicle (39). 
Device (1) according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the said support elements consist of grooved wheels 

(22). 
Device (1) according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that when the device (1) is 

mounted on the chassis of the vehicle (39), the said 
fifth wheel (21) occupies a position which is 

standardized for the semitrailer tractor unit (27). 
Device (1) according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that when the device (1) is 

mounted on the chassis of the vehicle (39), the fifth 
wheel (21) is substantially 1.5 m off the ground. 
Device (1) according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that when the said device (1) is 

mounted on the chassis of the vehicle, the axis of the 
fifth wheel (21) is substantially 0.1 m forward of the 

centre of gravity of the rear axle set of the vehicle. 
Road haulage or handling vehicle (39), 
characterized in that it is equipped with a device (1) 

according to any one of the preceding claims. 
Vehicle (39) according to Claim 12, characterized 
in that the said vehicle (39) is equipped with a coupling 

hook allowing a trailer to be towed.
