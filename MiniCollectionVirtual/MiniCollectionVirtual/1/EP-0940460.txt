<ABSTRACT>
To provide liquid composition that allows efficient production of easily
detachable adhesive solid, and adhesive products which are produced using

said composition, wherein said products can be used for repeated attaching and
detaching. Reduced adhesiveness can be restored by washing.
The liquid composition is cured by exposure to UV light to give
detachable adhesive solid. For example, liquid composition containing

oligourethane diacrylate, specific acrylic ester


acetophenone-derived photo-initiator, and additives
is screen-printed in a film with a thickness of 15 µm on 50% area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to UV curable liquid composition' for
printing or coating, and adhesive and detachable products obtained by using
said liquid composition.It was difficult to detach conventional adhesive products which were
applied with an adhesive agent after they were attached once and to attach
again on which one wants to attach when necessary.It took time to produce seals, labels, and stickers on which easy
detachable adhesive agent was printed or coated because water-soluble easy
detachable adhesive composition or solvent-soluble easy detachable adhesive
composition was used and a process to evaporate water or solvent was
required. In addition it was not suited to cleanse the adhesive surface of the
products to use again because products on which conventional easy detachable
adhesive composition was printed or coated may be damaged with kitchen
detergents such as non-ionic detergents or solvents such as alcohols and
benzine.It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a liquid
composition to produce easy detachable adhesive solid efficiently.Another object of the invention is to provide adhesive products which
are produced from said liquid composition, wherein said adhesive products can
be used repeatedly and adhesiveness can be restored by washing when
adhesiveness has decreased.The present invention provides liquid composition that is cured by
exposure to UV light, wherein the solid that is formed by the curing has easy
detachable adhesiveness.In general the main component of the present invention is composed of
monomers and oligomers which contain polymerizable double bonds. As these
monomers and oligomers polymerize making cross linkages to give solids, 
these solids give curable paints or curable inks generally. No solid could be
obtained that could solve the above-mentioned problems even if adhesive solids
could be obtained.It was, however, found that the cured material shows easy detachable
adhesiveness if a specified combination of monomer and oligomer are used.
Although the principle of the specified combination has not been clarified yet,
it was found that the following embodiments are at least preferred.Preferred monomers are by way of example mono-functional
monomers which are expressed in the following general formula.

   (n is 1-5, R1 is a hydrocarbon group of C1 to C15)An average value of n is preferably 1-3, R1 is a hydrocarbon group of
C6 to C9 most preferably, hydrocarbon groups are hexyl, octyl, nonyl, toluyl,
and cumyl groups most
