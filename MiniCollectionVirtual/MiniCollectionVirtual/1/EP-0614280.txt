<ABSTRACT>
In the present invention, a PNP bipolar transistor 
(Q11) is connected to both ends of a resistive element (R11) 

of a SPL circuit so as to place an emitter thereof at the 
side of a power supply source (1). Resistive elements 

(R2,R4) and an NPN bipolar transistor (Q3) constitutes a 
bias circuit for biasing a low voltage to a base of the PNP 

bipolar transistor. The base of the PNP transistor (Q11) is 
connected to an emitter node of a NPN bipolar transistor 

(Q1) through a capacitative load element (C1). By this 
construction, the present invention can operate the signal 

without any delay to turn on the PNP bipolar transistor. 
Therefore, the collector response speed of the SPL circuit 

can be increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a logic circuit and 
semiconductor integrated circuit device, and more 
particularly to technology effective for use in a Non 
Threshold Logic (NTL) circuit, a Super Push-pull Logic (SPL) 
circuit and further high-speed logical integrated circuits 
using these logic circuits as a basic circuit, for example. The NTL circuit is proposed as a high-speed and low 
electric power consuming digital logical circuit. For 
example, a SPL circuit and the like in which an Active Pull-Down 
(APD) circuit is provided in said NTL circuit are 
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Provisional Publication, 
No. 3-64123 (prior art 1). Further, in order to enhance 
the collector response of the SPL circuit, a SPL-B circuit 
is also proposed in Japanese Unexamined Provisional 
Publication, No. 3-267817 (prior art 2). Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing one example of the 
conventional SPL circuit (prior art 1). As shown in Fig. 1, 
the conventional SPL circuit has a phase splitting circuit 
comprising a bipolar transistor Q21 and resistive elements 
R21 and R23 which are connected in series between a positive 
power supply terminal 1 and a negative power supply terminal 
2. An input signal VIN is input into a base of the 
transistor Q21. In between the positive power supply 
terminal 1 and the negative power supply terminal 2, a 
bipolar transistor Q23 and a resistive element R24 are 
connected in series, and a negative power supply terminal 3 
is connected to a base of the transistor Q23. A capacity 
C22 is connected between a node A2 connecting the transistor 
Q21 and the resistive element R23 and a node A3 connecting 
the transistor Q23 and the resistive element R24. Further, 
a bipolar transistor Q22 and a bipolar transistor Q24 are 
connected in series between the positive power supply  
 
terminal 1 and the negative power supply terminal 2, a base 
of the transistor Q22 is connected to a node A1 and a base 
of the transistor Q24 is connected to the node A3. Both an 
emitter of the transistor Q22 and a collector of the 
transistor Q24 are connected to an output terminal VOUT. There exists a stray capacitance CC3 between the 
collector node (Node A1) of this phase splitting circuit and 
the negative power supply terminal 2. In this case, when 
the level of an input signal VIN is high, the transistor Q21 
is turned on so that the stray capacitance CC3 in the 
collector node (Node A1) is quickly discharged through the 
transistor Q21. When the level of the input signal VIN is low, however, 
the
