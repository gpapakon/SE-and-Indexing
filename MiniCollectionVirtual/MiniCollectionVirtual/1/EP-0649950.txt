<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a prefabricated thatched-roof element (35) comprising a multiplicity of stalks (50) which are aligned parallel to one another, consist of reeds, grasses or the like and are connected to form a transportable, sheet-like roof element (52), and further relates to a process and an apparatus for producing such prefabricated thatched-roof elements (35), and to a process for mounting the prefabricated thatched-roof parts (35) on a roof structure. In order to avoid leakages in the region of the joints between adjacent prefabricated thatched-roof elements (35), the invention proposes that the stalks (50) be releasably connected to one another in the region of the lateral borders of the roof element (52) which are parallel to the longitudinal direction of the stalks (50), with the result that, when the prefabricated element is mounted, the stalks (50) arranged there can mesh with stalks (50) which are arranged in the region of the lateral border of the corresponding adjacent prefabricated element (35). A water-impermeable substrate material can thereby be dispensed with, which can thus provide good living conditions in terms of climate, which can be compared with those of conventional thatched roofings. In this arrangement, the releasable connection is preferably produced with the aid of a binding wire (36a), which rests against the lateral stalks (50) from the outside and holds the latter together during the transportation of the prefabricated elements (35).
