<ABSTRACT>
Hydrocarbon lubricants having a high viscosity index (V.I.) and low pour point are produced by hydroisomerizing a waxy lube feed such as slack wax or a waxy gas oil over zeolite beta after which aromatic components are removed by extraction, e.g. with furfural. The raffinate is then dewaxed, preferably by solvent dewaxing, to the target pour point and then hydrofinished. The hydroisomerization coupled with the aromatics extraction and dewaxing increases the range of crudes that can be processed into high V.I. lubes while maintaining equivalent product qualities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of lubricants and more particularly, to a 
process for the production of hydrocarbon lubricants of 
high viscosity index. Mineral oil lubricants are derived from various 
crude oil stocks by a variety of refining processes 
which are directed towards obtaining a lubricant base 
stock of suitable boiling point, viscosity, viscosity 
index (VI) and other characteristics. Generally, the 
base stock is produced by distillation of the crude oil 
in atmospheric and vacuum distillation towers, followed 
by the separation of undesirable aromatic components 
and finally, by dewaxing and various finishing steps. 
Because aromatic components lead to high viscosity, 
poor viscosity indices and poor oxidative stability, 
the use of asphaltic type crudes is not preferred as 
the yield of acceptable lube stocks will be extremely 
low after the large quantities of aromatic components 
contained in such crudes have been separated out. 
Paraffinic crude stocks are therefore preferred but 
aromatic separation procedures are still necessary in 
order to remove undesirable aromatic components. In 
the case of the lubricant distillate fractions, 
generally referred to as the neutrals, e.g. heavy 
neutral and light neutral, the aromatics are extracted 
by solvent extraction using a solvent such as phenol, 
furfural or N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) which is 
selective for the extraction of the aromatic 
components. If the lube stock is a residual lube 
stock, asphaltenes are first removed in a propane 
deasphalting step followed by solvent extraction of the 
residual aromatics to produce a lube generally referred 
to as bright stock. In either case, however, a 
dewaxing step is normally necessary in order for the 
lubricant to have a satisfactorily low pour point and  
 
cloud point, so that it will not solidify or 
precipitate the less soluble paraffinic components 
under the influence of low temperatures. A number of dewaxing processes are known in the 
petroleum refining industry and of these, solvent 
dewaxing with solvents such as methylethylketone (MEK) 
and liquid propane, has achieved the widest use. 
Recently, however, increased use has been made of 
catalytic dewaxing processes for the production of 
lubricating oil stocks since these processes possess a 
number of advantages over the conventional solvent 
dewaxing procedures. The catalytic dewaxing processes 
which have been proposed are generally similar to those 
which have been proposed for dewaxing

lube product, and 
(iv) hydrofinishing the dewaxed product.
