<ABSTRACT>
The ride (10) is capable of raising a rider (22) to a height of ten meters or more above the ground, and then releasing the rider to swing. It includes a support structure (12), a support line (16) secured to the support structure at one end, with an opposed end secured to a rider, preferably to an attachment which is worn by a rider (20). A launch structure (26) is spaced from the support structure (12) and carries a launch line (24) which has an end (48) which is capable of being raised and lowered above the ground, and which is designed to be releasably attached to a rider attachment, so as to lift a rider from the ground. In operation the rider attachment with the support line attached is secured to the rider, the launch line is releasably secured to the attachment, and the launch line is activated to move the rider laterally and upwardly towards the top of the launch structure. When the launch line is released from the attachment which carries the rider, the rider swings downwardly at a high speed simulating the sensation of "body flight" in a pendulum like motion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a swing type amusement ride which includes a support structure, a
launch structure, and a mechanism capable of raising a rider to a position at least ten meters
above the ground, from which position the rider can swing from the launch structure in
a curved trajectory under the support structure.Heretofore, there have been a variety of different types of amusement rides and
apparatus for simulating the reduction of gravity to a rider. Some of these devices are
known to be disclosed in Fitch U.S. Patent 857,338; Ridgway U.S. Patent 2,779,596; Ryan
U.S. Patent 3,701,528; and Greenwood U.S. Patent 4,978,120.Furthermore, there have been a variety of playground and backyard swings and
swing sets used by children and adults. These swings can vary in height from a small swing
standing about three meters high, to a large swing standing about five meters high. A rider
of such a swing normally takes a sitting position in a swing seat and starts its pendulum
motion from a position in which the swing is vertical, unless aided by a running start, or by a
person to help push and enhance the height of the swing arc. While the sitting or standing
position on a swing seat is the norm, riders have been know to lie on their stomachs on top
of a swing seat and swing in a prone position, but without being secured to the swing.Even the most skillful and powerful swing rider on a large swing will rarely exceed a
2 o'clock or 10 o'clock position at a height of about seven meters, before gravity overtakes
the centripetal force of the swing, and slack occurs in the swing rope or chain. Should a
rider manage to force the swing to make a 360 degree circuit, his or her height would
seldom exceed about ten meters from the ground.The use external equipment to assist a swing rider to begin his or her ride from an
elevated position is taught in Hoppes U.S. Patent 1,731,532; Pruessner U.S. Patent
1,918,559; and Walker U.S. Patent 3,140,870. Each of these references disclose standard
playground and backyard type swing systems which have adjacent stairs which a person may
climb to start swinging from a position above the ground, and thereby obtain an immediate
swing elevation and experience an initial speed which is higher and faster than starting to
swing from the ground. But, even in these systems the initial height above the ground which
the rider experiences would seldom be more than about one to four meters.In some swing systems, and especially those designed for small children, and in some
amusement rides, bungee
