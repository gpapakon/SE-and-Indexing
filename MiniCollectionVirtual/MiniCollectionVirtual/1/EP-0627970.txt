<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to metal cutting tool assemblies, cutting tool inserts and, in particular, 
metal cutting tools having replaceable cutting inserts for use, for 
example, in milling, drilling, boring or turning operations. It also 
relates to shims for use in such assemblies. The cutting inserts for use with such metal cutting tools have 
generally been formed as single sided or double sided inserts, the latter, 
of course, being preferred seeing that it allows for doubling the number 
of cutting edges which are available for use. Such replaceable cutting 
inserts are clampingly retained in an insert retaining pocket formed in a 
tool holder with the insert itself resting either directly on a base wall of 
the pocket, or via a correspondingly shaped and sized shim. Such known 
cutting inserts are formed with rake surfaces which are generally 
provided with chip forming grooves. Where double sided cutting inserts 
are involved, the mounting of the insert must be such as to ensure that 
the lower cutting edge (i.e. the cutting edge not being at that stage 
operative) is protected against damage and, for this purpose, it is 
generally ensured that the construction of the lower surface of the insert 
and/or the adjacent bearing surface of the pocket wall or shim is such  
 
that a certain degree of spacing is maintained between the lowermost 
cutting edge and the adjacent bearing surface. However, the provision 
of the chip forming groove in the respective rake surfaces of the insert 
carries with it the consequence that the lower surface of the insert, which 
is provided with such a chip forming groove, bears on the corresponding 
surface of the shim or base wall of the pocket only in those central portions of 
the lower surface inwardly of the chip forming groove, which are spaced significantly from the cutting edges. It will therefore be realized that, with the exertion of machining 
forces on the insert and in view of the fact that the lower surface of 
the insert is only supported at its inner base portions, a bending moment 
is exerted on the insert which, especially in heavy duty conditions, could 
result in a fracture of the insert. It will be realized that the wider the 
chip forming groove, the greater is the bearing surface of the insert 
displaced inwardly from the cutting edge and the greater is the bending 
moment exerted on the insert. Such widening of the chip forming groove 
is generally necessary in heavy duty conditions in order to form chips of 
relatively large cross-sectional
