<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an opto-electronic receiver
apparatus for use in an optical fiber communications network. More
particularly, the present invention relates to methods and apparatus for
achieving an optical receiver with increased dynamic range.Transimpedance amplifiers are employed in optical receivers in
order to convert very small currents indicative of optical signals applied to
photodiode detectors. These small currents are then converted to signal
voltages of greater amplitude. In an optical fiber communications network
whereby a plurality of geographically distributed users each write onto a
common optical fiber, incoming optical signals from a nearby transmitter
may be detected at a high signal level, whereas incoming optical signals
received from a distant transmitter may be detected at very low signal
levels. Thus, to be effective, a transimpedance front end of the optical
receiver must be sufficiently sensitive effectively to receive the weakest
optical signals and must also be controllable to receive the strongest
optical signals without reaching saturation and resultant distortion in the
detected signal voltages.High sensitivity and high saturation level are contradictory
requirements for a transimpedance front end of an optical receiver. A
simplified representation of a typical transimpedance front end of an
optical receiver is illustrated in Fig. 1. With reference to the Fig. 1
configuration, if the amplification factor -A is sufficiently large, the
transimpedance is equivalent to the feedback resistance RL. On one hand,
for high sensitivity the RL value should be large because the noise current
introduced by the feedback resistor is inversely proportional to the resistor
value. On the other hand, to realize a high saturation level, the value of
RL should be small in order to limit signal excursion. Techniques reported in the prior art for increasing dynamic range
improvement typically involve the use of active devices at sensitive nodes
of the transimpedance amplifier. One example is given in Fig. 2. In Fig.
2, an FET device is provided at the input of the amplifier to shunt away
photo current at high signal levels to prevent saturation of the amplifier. In
Fig. 3, an FET device is shunted across a portion RL1 of the feedback
resistor RL in order to lower the value thereof at high signal levels. The
FET devices employed in these prior art examples are placed at sensitive
nodes, i.e. the input of the amplifier in Fig. 2 and across the feedback
resistor in Fig. 3. The FET
