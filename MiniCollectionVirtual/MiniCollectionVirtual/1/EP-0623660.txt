<ABSTRACT>
A lacquer composition which can be cured by a free-radical mechanism and essentially comprises   A) from 50 to 95 parts by weight of an unsaturated polyester component having a viscosity at 23@C of from 1000 to 15000 mPa.s, B) from 5 to 50 parts by weight of compounds containing (meth)acrylic groups and/or vinyl ether groups, and C) from 0.01 to 0.3% by weight, based on the overall weight, of waxes and/or paraffins having a melting point of from 35 to 100@C, D) from 0 to 10% by weight, based on the overall weight, of at least one plasticiser resin or carbamic acid resin, and also, if desired, E) other auxiliaries and additives which are known from the technology of the unsaturated polyester resins; and the use of the lacquer composition as a free-radically curable furniture varnish.

<CLAIMS>
Lacquer composition, radically curable at temperatures
below 80°C and composed of


A) from 50 to 95 parts by weight of an
α,β-ethylenically unsaturated polyester

component, having a viscosity at 23°C of 1000 to

15000 mPa.s, consisting of at least one polyester
resin, which resin has been prepared by the

reaction of

a) a dicarboxylic acid component consisting, to
the extent of 75 to 100 carboxyl

equivalents-%, of α,β-ethylenically
unsaturated dicarboxylic acids having 4 or 5

carbon atoms and/or anhydrides thereof and,
to the extent of 0 to 25 carboxyl

equivalents-%, of other dicarboxylic acids
not corresponding to this definition and

having 4 to 10 carbon atoms or anhydrides
thereof,

with
b) an alcohol component consisting, to the
extent of 15 to 60 hydroxyl equivalents-%,

of at least one β,γ-ethylenically
unsaturated alkylene ether alcohol having 6

to 14 carbon atoms and, to the extent of 40
to 85 hydroxyl equivalents-%, of other

monohydric and/or dihydric alcohols not
corresponding to this definition and having

molecular weights in the range of 32 to 400, 
an equivalent ratio of carboxyl groups to

hydroxyl groups of at most 1:1 being
maintained,
B) from 5 to 50 parts by weight of compounds
containing (meth)acrylic groups and/or vinyl

ether groups and having a viscosity at 23°C of 10
to 1000 mPa.s and having molecular weights in the

range of 72 to 1000,

the sum of the parts by weight of A) and B) totalling
100,


C) from 0.01 to 0.3 wt.%, based on the total weight
of components A) to D), of waxes and/or paraffins

having a melting point of 35°C to 100°C as sealing
agents,
D) from 0 to 10 wt.%, based on the total weight of
components A) to D), of at least one plasticising

resin or urea resin,

and optionally

E) other auxiliary substances and additives known
from the technology of unsaturated polyester

resins.
Lacquer composition according to claim 1,
characterised in that the acid component a) consists

to the extent of 75 to 100 carboxyl equivalents-% of
fumaric acid and the alcohol component b) consists to

the extent of 15 to 60 hydroxyl equivalents-% of
trimethylolpropane diallyl ether. 
Lacquer composition according to claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that component D) is present in a

quantity of from 0.1 to 10 wt.%, based on the total
weight of components A) to D).
Use of the lacquer compositions according to claims 1
to 3 as radically curable furniture lacquer.
