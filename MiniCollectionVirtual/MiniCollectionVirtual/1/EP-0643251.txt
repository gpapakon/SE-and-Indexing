<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spigot and socket connection for plastic pipes, in the case of which the spigot end (31) of one pipe (3) is pushed into that end of the other pipe (1) which is widened to form a connecting socket (2). In this arrangement, between the cylindrical pipe section (1) and the connecting socket (2), a conical transition region (13) is integrally formed on the socket neck. After the pushing-in operation, the end surface (32) of the plugged-in spigot end (31) rests against said conical transition region (13). Sealing (4) between the connecting socket (2) and the spigot end (31) is effected by a sealing element (4) which is introduced into a circumferential bead (21) formed on the connecting socket. The sealing element (4), on the one hand, bears against the spigot end (31) of the plugged-in pipe (3) in a sealing manner, it being deformed in the process, and, on the other hand, presses into the circumferential bead (21) formed on the connecting socket. According to the invention, at least one stop zone (A), directed from the outside inwards, is made in the conical transition region (13) between the cylindrical pipe section (1) and the connecting socket (2). Said stop zone (A) exhibits at least one bearing surface which is directed counter to the pushing-in direction of the spigot end (31), is perpendicular to the pipe axis and is intended for the end surface (32) of the pushed-in spigot end (31).

Push-fit joint for plastic pipes whereby the spigot end of the one pipe is pushed 
into the end of the other pipe expanded into a sleeve, with the sleeve neck 

between the cylindrical pipe section and the joint sleeve featuring an integral 
tapered transitional section against which rests the end face of the inserted 

spigot, and sealing being accomplished by means of a sealing element that is 
inserted into a bead extending around the circumference of the joint sleeve and 

which on the one hand forms a seal against the spigot of the inserted pipe and on 
the other hand presses into the circumferential bead, characterised by the fact 

that the tapered transitional section (13) between the cylindrical pipe section (1) 
and the joint sleeve (2) features at least one embossed, inwardly facing stop zone 

(A) which, perpendicular to the pipe axis, exhibits at least one contact face 
pointing away from the direction of insertion of the spigot (31) for the end face 

(32) of the inserted spigot (31). 
Push-fit joint as claimed in claim 1, characterised by the fact that the height of the 
contact face corresponds to the difference in diameter between the inside width 

of the joint sleeve (2) and the inside width of the cylindrical pipe section (1). 
Push-fit joint as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterised by the fact that the stop 
zone comprises stop cams (11, 12, 14, 15) which are distributed evenly 

throughout the circumference of the tapered transitional section (13). 
Push-fit joint as claimed in claim 1, characterised by the fact that the spigot (31) 
of the inserted pipe (3) exhibits an internal bevel of 15Â°.  

 
Push-fit joint as claimed in claim 1, characterised by the fact that the sealing 
element is an asymmetrical lipped sealing ring (4), the lipped section (41) of 

which projects into the inside diameter of the joint sleeve (2) and points towards 
the sleeve end. 
Push-fit joint as claimed in claim 1, characterised by the fact that the 
circumferential bead (21) extends around the central section of the joint sleeve 

(2).
