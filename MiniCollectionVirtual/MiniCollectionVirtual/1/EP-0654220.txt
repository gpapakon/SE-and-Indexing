<ABSTRACT>
A fat component useful for preparing a reduced calorie food product, said fat 
component comprising edible triglyceride and a polytetramethylene ether glycol esterified 

with a fatty acid entity. Reduced calorie food compositions containing the esterified 
glycols and a method of reducing calories in a food product are also disclosed. The fatty 

acid-esterified polytetramethylene ether glycols have good organoleptic properties as well 
as high resistance to thermal and oxidative degradation, making them especially suitable 

for the preparation of fried and baked foods. In certain embodiments, fat substitutes 
having a high solids content at room or body temperature may be readily obtained without 

the use of high proportions of long chain saturated fatty acids.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to food compositions utilizing a polytetramethylene ether
glycol esterified with a fatty acid entity to replace, in whole or in part, conventional high
calorie edible lipids. The fatty acid-esterified polytetramethylene ether glycol fat mimetics
are surprisingly resistant to lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis, despite the primary structure of
the ester linkages contained therein. At the same time, however, sufficient partial
digestion takes place upon consumption so as to alleviate the problems with anal oil
leakage often encountered with synthetic fat substitutes.A wide variety of substances have been proposed for use as fat substitutes in food
compositions. The chemical structures of such substances are selected such that they
are more resistant to breakdown by the metabolic processes of the human digestive
system which normally occur upon ingestion of conventional triglyceride lipids. Because
of their increased resistance to digestion and absorption, the number of calories per gram
available from these fat substitutes is considerably reduced as compared to common
vegetable oils, animal fats, and other lipids. Such substances thus may be utilized in the
preparation of reduced calorie food compositions useful in the control of body weight.U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,613 describes one class of particularly useful fat substitutes
wherein a polyol such as glycerin is alkoxylated with an epoxide such as propylene oxide 
under basic conditions and then esterified with any of a number of fatty acids to form an
esterified epoxide-extended polyol. These substances have the physical and organoleptic
properties of conventional triglyceride lipids, yet are significantly lower in available calories
owing to their pronounced resistance towards pancreatic lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis.Unfortunately, as a consequence of their hydrolytic stability, low digestibility, and
lipophilic character the esterified epoxide-extended polyols described in U.S. Pat. No.
4,861,613 which are fully liquid at body temperature may tend to cause certain
undesirable gastrointestinal side effects when consumed at high levels in the diet. That
is, since such esterified alkoxylated polyols are not readily broken down into simpler
substances upon ingestion, they retain their oily, fat-like character and pass through the
digestive tract in substantially unaltered form. Problems with leakage of the fat substitute
through the anal sphincter and separation of the fat substitute as an oil from the excreted
fecal matter can occur as a result
