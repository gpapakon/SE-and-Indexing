<ABSTRACT>
Noise nuisance is considerably reduced by arranging in 
the web recess of a rail bar a mouldable material (9) with a low 

specific mass, for instance Corkelast速. When a body of 
considerably greater specific mass (10,11) is arranged in this mass 

the generated noise is limited still further. Application in 
a railway system wherein the body of the wheels of the train 

or tram is filled with Corkelast速 brings about a still 
further limitation of the noise nuisance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rail bar of which at
least the web recess is filled from head to base with a
mouldable material of a low specific mass.Rail and tramway services cause noise nuisance.
Particularly for instance where the train or tram moves
through a bend in the route, a high screeching noise
level is generated which strikes the human ear as being
unpleasant. In built-up areas it is the intention to
counter this nuisance by placing sound-insulating walls
and the like. In the case of tram services in a built-up
area this is not possible, or hardly so.EP-A-0 404 756 discloses a rail bar whereof the web
recess is filled to at least the head and the base of the
rail with a mouldable material. Furthermore, the interposing
of a rubber material between the rail and a underlying
steelplate is known from this publication.It is the object of the invention to prevent the
problem of noise nuisance at the source and to bring
about vibration damping, that is, the attempt is made to
prevent the occurrence of the noise.This is achieved according to the invention by
employing a rail bar whereof a rod-like body of considerably
greater specific mass is arranged in said mouldable
material of low specific mass, near the base of the rail.Said body absorbs the vibration energy generated in
the rail bar. The body can for instance be of steel.A suitable material for the application according to
the invention is a polymer filled with finely divided
cells, for instance cork particles. This product is
commercially available under the name Corkelast速.The material can be arranged in the web recess of
the rail bar by means of casting. In existing rail constructions an element in the
form and size of the web recess of the rail bar can be
arranged by means of adhesive.A further improvement can be achieved by arranging
the rail bars on the support of the rail bar with interposing
of a support layer of flexible material with a
specific mass equal to or lower than that of the surrounding
mass. A layer of material of low specific mass can
be arranged between the flexible support layer and the
rail bar.A further improvement in the operation of a railway
system is obtained by use of rail bars according to the
invention.The invention is elucidated with reference to a
drawing of an embodiment.
