<ABSTRACT>
A solid-state image pickup device includes a light 
receiving cell for accumulating electric charges 

created in response to a photo energy striking the gate 
of an amplification-type sensor and then produces a 

signal from the source region based on the accumulated 
carriers, a memory cell including an amplification-type 

memory cell having the same type as that of the above-mentioned 
amplification-type sensor, to accumulate a 

signal transferred from the light receiving cell into 
the base region of the amplification-type memory cell, 

and a signal line for electrically connecting the 
source region of the light receiving cell and the 

source region of the memory cell. The shift of the 
accumulation start timing to each row of the light 

receiving cells is suppressed to a small value. The 
same signal can be read from the memory cell several 

times.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid-state
image pickup device and more particularly to a solid-state
image pickup device including amplification-type
light receiving cells.Figs. 1 to 4 show a structural example of a
known solid-state image pickup device,
respectively. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the entire
circuit configuration. The pixels 21-11 to 21-mn (shown by broken lines) are
arranged in a matrix form in a substrate. Each pixel
is formed of an n-channel, normally-on-type (depletion-type)
static induction transistor (SIT) 22, a gate
capacitor 24 arranged on the floating gate 23 of the
SIT 22, and a p-channel, enhancement-type control
transistor 25 having a source-drain path connected to
the floating gate 23.
A video voltage Vd is applied to the
drain electrode (substrate) of the SIT forming each
pixel. Row lines 26-1 to 26-m are connected to the gate
capacitors of the SITs in each of the row groups of the
pixels 21-11 to 21-1n, ..., 21-ml to 21-mn arranged in
the X-direction, and a vertical scanning circuit
(vertical shift register) 27 supplies row 
selection signals G1 to Gm. Each of the column lines
28-1 to 28-n is connected to the sources of the SITs in
the column groups of pixels 21-11 to 21-m1, ..., 21-1n
to 21-mn arranged in the Y-direction. The column lines
are grounded via column selection transistors 29-1
to 29-n, a common video line 30, and a load
resistor 31. A horizontal scanning circuit
(horizontal shift register) 32 applies column
selection signals S1 to Sn to the gates of the column
selection transistors 29-1 to 29-n.
A control gate line 33 is connected to the gate electrode
of the control transistor in each pixel to apply
a control gate signal C. An overflow drain line 34
is connected to the drain electrode of each control
transistor 25 to apply the control drain voltage Vc.Fig. 2 is a plan view showing the layout of four
pixels adjoining to one another. Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional
view showing the layout taken along the line
A-A'. In this layout example, in order to improve the
area efficiency of pixels formed on the substrate 40,
the adjoining four pixels are symmetrically formed
laterally and horizontally in the figure. The
substrate 40 serves as the drain of the static induction
transistors and is formed of an n+ or n-type
semiconductor. An n- epitaxial layer 41 is grown on the
substrate 40. An isolation region 42 such as a buried
insulating material is formed in the epitaxial layer 41 
to separate electrically and optically the adjoining
pixels. In each pixel, the
