<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPACT DEVICEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention pertains to an impacting device, and in particular, to an impact bucket. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONImpact devices are often used in demolition, excavation, mining and the like endeavors, to break and separate material for easier removal. One common impact device is an impact hammer, such as illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 3,363,512 to Ottestad. Impact hammers generally include a fluid-driven, reciprocal piston which is struck against a spike or spade shaped tool element to penetrate and break up the material. Although these hammers can be hand manipulated, they are usually mounted on the end of a boom of a carrier, such as a back hoe. These hammers are effective in penetrating hard materials, such as concrete or stone. However, the hammers generally only form a small bore or opening with each pass into the material. As a result a number of passes are often required to effectively break and separate the material. Moreover, after the material is sufficiently broken, it must be removed by a bucket. The use of a bucket requires that the hammer be exchanged for the bucket or that an independent carrier with a bucket be used. These options undesirably increase the downtime and cost of the operation.As can be appreciated, ordinary buckets do not form good devices for the break up and separation of hard material. Although the buckets can be struck against the material, it cannot match the speed or force of a conventional impact hammer. Further, buckets are not ordinarily fabricated to withstand these types of impact loads. To increase the penetration capacity of buckets, some artisansSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

have coupled vibration inducing mechanisms to the front teeth of the bucket. Two examples of this type of construction are illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 3,645,021 to Sonerud and West German Patent No. 24 37 468. These devices, however, have little effect when encountering a hard material.Impact buckets were specifically developed to perform the dual role of an impact hammer and a bucket. More particularly, impact buckets are buckets which have impact hammer units incorporated in their construction. The hammers are operatively connected to a movable front edge which acts as the impact tool element. Examples of such impact buckets are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,892,358 and 4,892,359 to Ottestad. These tools can effectively penetrate and separate pieces from a hard material. Further, the tool element is an elongated member which can quickly cut across
