<ABSTRACT>
A pyrotechnic buckle pretensioning device for a three 
point vehicle safety restraint and which has the buckle 

(54) connected to a cable (55) supported by a bracket (43) 
providing a cable guide 46, the bracket carrying a main 

body (41) incorporating a pyrotechnic gas generator 53 and 
a piston and locking assembly (58) movable in a cylinder 

42 by gas pressure to tension the cable and move the 
buckle in a restraint tightening sense, the assembly of 

the bracket to the body being arranged to act as a cover 
member to retain the pyrotechnic gas generator 51 and to 

locate a resilient cable seal 49 under compression to 
maintain improved sealing around the cable 55 against the 

gas pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pyrotechnic tensioning 
device and relates especially but not exclusively to 
assembly of pyrotechnic tensioning devices for passenger 
safety restraints for vehicles. It is well known to provide energy for activating 
passenger seat belt pretensioning mechanism by detonating 
small pyrotechnic devices to produce gas for activating 
a piston in a cylinder. The piston may be connected via 
a tensioning cable to the safety restraint. Typically a 
pyrotechnic pretensioner housing is designed with a side 
recess or bore to receive the respective pyrotechnic gas 
generator which is located therein by crimping or peening 
of the housing to retain it against the high gas pressures 
and the cable passes outwards through a separate aperture. 
Such an arrangement of the components is considered 
undesirable for quantity production especially in view of 
possible indeterminate gas leaks and the present invention 
seeks to provide an assembly which is improved for both 
manufacture and function. In particular, since it is 
desirable to employ a stranded steel cable there is a 
tendency for excess gas leakage via the uneven 
circumferential surface thereof. According to the present invention there is provided a 
pyrotechnic pretensioning device for a vehicle passenger  
 
safety restraint comprising a housing including a piston 
and cylinder and a pyrotechnic gas generator operable to 
generate gas pressure in said cylinder to move the piston, 
a tensioning cable passing through an aperture in said 
housing for connection of the piston to the safety restraint 
and characterised in that said aperture is provided 
with a resiliently deformable seal member through which 
the cable passes said deformable seal member being held 
under compression by the attachment of a cover member. In order that the invention may be more clearly understood 
and readily carried into effect the invention will be 
described by way of an example with reference to the 
accompanying drawing of which Figs. 1a and 1b diagrammatically illustrate 
partially sectioned and plan views 
respectively of a pyrotechnic pretensioner. Figs. 2a and 2b illustrate similar views of an 
alternative Figs. 3a and 3b illustrate similar views of 
yet a further alternative and Figs . 4a and 4b illustrate details of a buckle 
pretensioner employing the invention.  Referring to Figs. 1a and 1b, the pretensioner 
illustrated therein is intended to be for connection to 
a buckle anchorage of a three-point passenger seat belt 
arrangement.

<CLAIMS>
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device for a vehicle 
passenger safety restraint comprising a housing 

(1;21;31;41) including a piston (8;58) and cylinder (2;42) 
and a pyrotechnic gas generator (11;51) operable to 

generate gas pressure in said cylinder (2;52) to move the 
piston (8;58), a tensioning cable (7;55) passing through 

an aperture in said housing for connection of the piston 
to the safety restraint and characterised in that said 

aperture is provided with a resiliently deformable seal 
member (9;49) through which the cable passes said 

deformable seal member being held under compression by the 
attachment of a cover member (4;44). 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in 
claim 1, characterised in that said cover member 

additionally extends across the open end of a recess 
(14;57) which thereby locates the pyrotechnic gas 

generator (11;51). 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that said cover member 

(4;44) is an integral part of a pretensioning device 
mounting bracket (3;43). 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that said cover member 

comprises a flange (4;44) of a pretensioner mounting 
 

bracket (43). 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in 
claim 4, characterised in that said flange (44) is 

attached to said housing (41) by screws. 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in 
claim 4 characterised in that housing is provided with an 

external screw thread and said flange is attached to said 
housing (21) by a screw-threaded attachment ring (42) 

cooperating with said external screw thread. 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in 
claim 4, characterised in that said bracket (23) is 

attached to said housing by means of supplementary flanges 
(37) of the one part which having means which cooperate 

with studs (36) of the other part. 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in any 
preceding claim characterised in that said seal member 49 

is externally tapered to be accommodated in a tapered 
recess, the natural length thereof being somewhat greater 

than the internal length of the recess 57. 
A pyrotechnic pretensioning device as claimed in any 
preceding claim, characterised in that said seal member 

(49) is provided with a cut or cuts (49c; 49d) permitting 
assembly without threading the cable (55) therethrough.
