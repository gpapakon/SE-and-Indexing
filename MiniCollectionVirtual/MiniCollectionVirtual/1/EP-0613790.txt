<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a recording medium comprising at 
least a base and an ink-receiving layer, wherein said base 

comprises a biodegradable polymeric material. The 
recording medium has good ink-jet recordability owing to 

the formation of a suitable ink-receiving layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording medium, 
particularly to a recording medium suitable for use in 
ink-jet recording, an ink-jet recording method using the 
same, and an ink-jet recorded article. An ink-jet recording method attracts attention as a 
printing method which scarcely produces noise and can 
conduct high-speed printing and color printing. As recording media used in this ink-jet recording 
method, there have been used, for example, paper for ink-jet 
recording in which a specific porous ink-receiving 
layer is provided on a base essentially consisting of 
ordinary plain paper, and transparent recording media for 
OHP in which the same ink-receiving layer as that used in 
the paper for ink-jet recording is provided on a sheet 
essentially consisting of a synthetic plastic. Particularly speaking on the recording media for 
OHP, as materials making up these media, mainly materials 
making up bases, there have been used films comprising a 
synthetic plastic such as a polyester resin, diacetate 
resin, triacetate resin, acrylic resin, polycarbonate  
 
resin, polyvinyl chloride resin or polyimide resin. On the other hand, the amounts of synthetic plastic 
materials used in a variety of industrial fields show a 
tendency to increase year by year. The amount of waste 
synthetic plastics also increases correspondingly, and so 
their disposal becomes a great social problem in the 
world. These waste plastics are recovered to incinerate 
or subject to disposal by land-fills. The incineration of the conventional synthetic 
plastics have often caused damage to an incinerator 
because of their high calorific value. In addition, many 
of them have generated harmful gases upon their 
incineration. Besides, in the disposal by land-fills, 
problems of maintaining places of the disposal and of 
adversely affecting natural environment also have come to 
be considerable. Under such circumstances, the problem of waste 
disposal after use also has become important on articles 
of consumption for ink-jet recording making use of 
synthetic plastics with the spread thereof from the 
viewpoint of environmental problem or the like. In particular, the recording media for OHP must 
claim adequate consideration for the waste disposal after 
use because their bases are made up of a synthetic plastic 
as described above. The conventional OHP films for ink-jet 
take no account of the problems of the waste disposal  
 
as described above, and so they have some fear of adverse 
influence on environment when they are
