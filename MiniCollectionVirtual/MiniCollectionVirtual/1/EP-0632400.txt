<ABSTRACT>
In storage phosphor radiography a latent x-ray 
image of a patient (118),(120),(122),(124) is 

stored in a storage phosphor (136),(138),(140),(142). 
A storage phosphor reader (10) converts the latent 

image into an x-ray image signal. A patient 
identifying and exam collection bar code system 

provides patient identification and x-ray exam data at 
the time of the exam which is matched with the x-ray 

image signal in the reader (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to storage
phosphor radiography in which a latent x-ray image of a
patient stored in a storage phosphor is converted to an
x-ray image signal. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a storage phosphor radiography
patient identification system for matching patient x-ray
exam data with the patient's x-ray image.In conventional film/screen radiography, a
commonly used patient identification system has the
following features.
1. A requisition is filled out by the
radiologist ordering a specific exam to be performed on
a patient. The requisition is sent to the radiology
department.2. A technologist takes the requisition, an
x-ray film cassette, and a portable x-ray generator to
the patient bedside.3. The technologist performs the exam and
the film is exposed to x-rays.4. The requisition is taped to the cassette
and the exposed film is taken to the darkroom.5. A preprinted information card is
"flashed" on to the film. Such information includes
the patient name, medical record number, birth date,
hospital name, current date and other standard
information.6. The film is processed, and the radiology
technologist verifies that a "good" image has been
recorded.7. A sticker is applied to the film which
records the date, time of exposure, technique, and
technologist identification.8. The finished x-ray film is placed on a
light box for review and diagnosis by a radiologist or
physician.Because of the inherent disadvantages of film
radiography in the acquisition, storage and
transmission of x-ray images, there has been proposed a
storage phosphor radiography system. Temporary x-ray
images stored in a storage phosphor are converted into
an x-ray image digital signal which can be stored,
processed and transmitted. As described in US-A-RE-31,847,
a photostimulable phosphor sheet is exposed to
an image-wise pattern of short wavelength radiation,
such as x-ray radiation, to record a latent image
pattern in the photostimulable phosphor sheet. The
latent image is read out by stimulating the phosphor
with a relatively long wavelength stimulating
radiation, such as red or infrared light. Upon
stimulation, the stimulable phosphor releases emitted
radiation of an intermediate wavelength, such as blue
or violet light, in proportion to the quantity of x-ray
radiation that was received. An x-ray image signal is
produced by scanning the stimulable phosphor sheet in a
raster pattern by means of a beam of laser light
deflected by an oscillating or rotating scanning
mirror. The emitted

<CLAIMS>
A patient identification and x-ray exam data collection bar
code system, having:


a patient bar code(152,154,156,158) adapted to be located with a
patient for identifying a patient;
a storage phosphor (136,138,140,142) for storing an x-ray image
of a patient, said storage phosphor having a storage phosphor bar code

(144,146,148,150) for identifying the storage phosphor;
an x-ray exam bar code card (168) locatable with an x-ray source
(126) for identifying x-ray examination characteristics of said x-ray image stored in

said storage phosphor (136,138,140,142), wherein said exam bar code chart (168)
includes sets of exam bar codes (170A, 170B, 170C,...) identifying unique body

parts of a patient, x-ray exposure conditions;
a hand-held bar code scanner (172) having a user input (178), a
memory (176), a digital controller (173), and a display (180), for scanning the

patient bar code, the storage phosphor bar code and a bar code (170A, 170B,
170C,..) from at least one of said sets of bar codes on said exam bar code chart

(168); said system being 
characterized by
a required fields control card (193) having bar codes representing
required fields bar code scanner commands for designating and storing x-ray

exam data fields as "required fields" in the bar code scanner memory (176) where
a technologist is required to enter the corresponding data before a patient record

is complete, and bar codes representing specific x-ray exam data fields to be
scanned once by a bar code scanner user for selection as "required fields"; and
a default values control card (192) having bar codes representing
default values bar code scanner commands for designating and storing x-ray

exam data values as "default values" in the bar code scanner memory (176), and
bar codes representing default values for exam characteristics to be scanned once

for selection as "default values" which need not to be scanned at the time of an x-ray
exam.
The system of claim 1 wherein said patient identifying bar
code (152,154,156,158) has the form of an encoded bar code using the system

code, such that said encoded patient identifying bar code can be directly scanned
into said bar code scanner (172), or said patient identifying bar code is encoded in

a different coding scheme, such that said bar code scanner (172) must first be
conditioned before it can read in said differently encoded patient bar code. 
The system of claim 3 wherein said bar code scanner (172) is
adapted f
or decoding patient identifying bar codes encoded with a plurality of
different coding schemes, and when no patient identifying bar code is present or

the bar code cannot be read, patient identifying data are manually entered with
said user input means (178) on said bar code scanner (172).
The system of claim 1 including a technologist bar code (191)
for identifying the technologist performing said x-ray exam, wherein said

technologist bar code (191) has the form of an encoded bar code using the system
code, such that said encoded technologist bar code (191) can be directly scanned

into said bar code scanner (172), or said technologist bar code is encoded in a
different coding scheme, such that said bar code scanner (172) must first be

conditioned before it can read in said differently encoded technologist bar code
(191).
The system of claim 1 wherein said x-ray exam bar code card
(168) comprises bar codes representing fixed common comments about exam

conditions like "patient moved", "patient large", "patient small", "patient uncooperative", to be
scanned at the time of an exam for appending these comments to the x-ray exam

data values.
