<ABSTRACT>
An inflator assembly (10) for inflating an inflatable 
vehicle occupant restraint (12) includes a pressure vessel 

(14) with a storage chamber (18) containing a combustible 
mixture of gases. An ignitable material (122), when 

burning, increases the pressure of the mixture of gases by 
igniting the mixture of gases. The mixture of gases is 

released to exit the storage chamber (18) at a first flow 
rate and subsequently at a second, greater flow rate. A 

first gas outlet opening (172) is provided in the pressure 
vessel (14) when the inflator assembly (10) is actuated, 

and a second gas outlet opening (186) is subsequently 
provided in the pressure vessel (14) at a predetermined 

time. A diffuser (176) directs gas from the gas outlet 
openings (172) and (186) into the inflatable vehicle 

occupant restraint (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for inflating an inflatable vehicle occupant 
restraint, such as an air bag. A known apparatus for inflating an inflatable vehicle 
occupant restraint, such as an air bag, includes a pressure 
vessel for storing a quantity of inflation fluid under 
pressure. The pressure vessel includes a burst disk which 
is ruptured in response to vehicle deceleration of a 
magnitude indicating the occurrence of a collision. When 
the burst disk is ruptured, it defines an outlet opening 
through which the inflation fluid flows from the pressure 
vessel toward the vehicle occupant restraint to inflate the 
vehicle occupant restraint. The area of the opening 
defined by the ruptured burst disk is a factor in 
determining the rate at which the inflation fluid flows 
into the vehicle occupant restraint. Most specificly, DE-A-42 31 356 (D1) discloses an apparatus for 
inflating an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint of the type 
referred to in the preamble of claim 1. In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus for 
inflating an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint as set forth 
in claim 1 is provided. Further embodiments of the invention 
are disclosed in the dependent claims.  
 In accordance with the present invention, an apparatus 
for inflating an inflatable vehicle occupant restraint, 
such as an air bag, comprises a pressure vessel means and 
an igniter means. The pressure vessel means defines a 
chamber for containing gas under pressure. A combustible 
mixture of gases is contained in the chamber. The igniter 
means increases the pressure of the mixture of gases by 
igniting the mixture of gases. In accordance with a principal feature of the present 
invention, the apparatus further includes an outlet means 
for releasing gas to exit the chamber. The outlet means 
releases the gas to exit the chamber at a first flow rate 
and subsequently at a second, greater flow rate. The 
outlet means provides a first gas outlet opening in the 
pressure vessel means to open the pressure vessel means 
when the outlet means is actuated. The outlet means 
provides a second gas outlet opening in the pressure vessel 
means at a predetermined time after providing the first gas 
outlet opening. A directing means directs gas from the gas 
outlet openings into the vehicle occupant restraint. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, 
the first and second gas outlet openings have predetermined 
flow areas. The apparatus thus controls the magnitudes of 
the
