<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chipboard with oriented structure comprising fibres (1) of vegetable origin e.g. wooden chippings having been fixed with some binding material (5) in their oriented position. The characteristic feature of the invention lies in that the fibres (1) of vegetable origin comprise ferromagnetic particles (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CHIPBOARD WITH A WELL ORDERED STRUCTUREThe Field of the InventionThe invention relates to a chipboard with a regular well-ordered structure comprising fibre of vegetable ' origin so e.g. wood chippings, having been fixed with some binding material- in its oriented position.Description of the Prior ArtSeveral types of chipboards are known, so for example the traditional single- or multilayer chipboards, the multilayer chipboard made of wide flat wooden chippings bound with formaldehyderesin /flakeboard/ or the single- or multilayer board /waferboard/ made of large sized (20-40 mm) long wooden chips. Chipboards containing sawdust or other kinds of chippings covered on both sides with plywood (comply) are also known. Mechanical characteristics - not meeting always requirements - with traditional chipboards as well as ever increasing prices of raw materials forced researchers of the wood industry to develop chipboards differing from the traditional embodiments.A chipboard of newer type is represented by recent¬ ly developed so-called OSB board (oriented structural board) made of 30-50 mm long and of 1015 mm wide, large-sized wooden chippings, being a single or multi- -layer product. (Holzrundschau 1981/12. p. 386-388.)Mechanic features of the OSB boards correspond to those of the sandwich boards coated with plywood, the more, they yield better characteristics (Forest Product Journal 33/2. p. 43-49.) US-PS 3.164.511 discloses an apparatus being suitable for the production of oriented structural boards. The apparatus disclosed therein directs echani- 

 cally the large-sized chippings. Mechanical guidance takes places with cylinders provided with cells. Later guidance of chippings by means of cylinders with discs became known. Drawback of said mechanical guidance lies in that operation is rather slow, accordingly these apparatuses are less suitable for large-scale plants.Mechanical guidance was further developed by Bison Works (USA) : guiding plates provided with chain rows have been employed. To enhance production later electrostatic orientation was introduced (Forest In¬ dustries 12/4. p. 26-27) - Sizes needed for electrostatic orientation were as follows: length of the chippings: 75 ram to 100 mm, width: 10-15 mm thickness: 0,3 - 0,5 mm (Holz-Zentralblatt 105/84, p. 1236) .US-PS 5.045.528 describes an electrostatically orienting apparatus. For the sake of electrostatic orientation chippings have to fall freely in vertical direction. Free fall takes place between caset-te inserts forming the
