<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool according
to the preamble part of claim 1 and to an indexable cutting
insert according to the preamble part of claim 8. Such a
cutting tool and such an insert are known from US-A-4 618 296, respectively.Ball nose end mills are known which can perform omnidirectional
cutting and contouring of irregular shapes on work-pieces.
Such tools feature cutting edges integrally formed
with the cutter body or cemented carbide cutting elements
brazed onto the cutter body. Such designs require
considerable manufacturing effort. The cutting edges can
be reground or sharpened only with considerable difficulty
and with a suitable grinding machine. After regrinding, a
loss of diametrical size occurs, necessitating careful
machine adjustments when returning the reground tool to
service. Tools with integrally formed cutting blades are of
a single material and, therefore, are limited to use on
certain narrow categories of workpiece materials. A brazed
tool is known from US-A-4 132 493.US-A-4 175 896 discloses a ball nose end mill
having indexable cutting inserts. US-A-4 618 296 discloses a ball nose end mill and inserts
therefor. The inserts have equilateral polygonal shapes
and have a clearance face which varies around the insert in
order to provide clearance during radial cutting. At least
two cutting inserts are provided to effect arcuate cuts
during radial cutting. The clearance angle measured at the
cutting edge varies around the insert.EP-A-0 462 954 discloses a ball end mill, and throwaway
inserts for such mills. A main insert is of triangular
shape. Rearward of its cutting edges as well as around the
corner arcs of the insert beveled faces of a substantially
constant width are provided. The clearance angle, defined
by said beveled faces, is varying along the perimeter of
the insert.It is a task of the invention to provide an improved cutting
tool as well as an indexable cutting insert for such cutting
tools, allowing the formation of arcuate cuts of substantially
uniform radius when using only one insert.Said task can be achieved with the features contained in
independent claims 1 and 8.The cutting insert has an upwardly sloping convex first
major face with a constant clearance angle maintained along
the entire clearance face of the insert. The clearance face
is formed along the first major surface which is uniform
along the entire perimeter of the insert. The clearance
angle is maintained constant around the clearance face
relative to a line drawn through the center

A cutting tool, comprising:

a cylindrical shank (12) terminating in an spherical
cutting end (14), the cutting end including at least one

indexable cutting insert (16) comprising first (18) and
second (20) polygonal major faces, flank surfaces (22)

forming the sides of the polygon with two of the flank
surfaces intersecting at each corner (24,25) thereof,

the first major face (18) including upwardly sloping
convex portions (26) intersecting each flank surface (22)

to form arcuate cutting edges (28) along each side
of the polygon, said convex portions (26) including

corresponding clearance face portions (30) extending
along said first major face (18) rearwardly from each of

said cutting edges (28), said second major face (20)
intersecting each flank surface (22) at an angle of at

least 90 degrees forming rake edges (42), at least one
mounting cavity (46) shaped for respective receipt in

lay-down fashion of the indexable cutting insert (16),
and means mounting the indexable cutting insert

respectively in the mounting cavity, the cavity oriented
such that an active arcuate cutting edge (28) of the

insert (16) placed in lay-down fashion in the cavity
will extend radially outwardly from a corner arc of the

insert passing through a longitudinal axis (50) of the
shank (12),
characterized in that
said clearance face portions (30) are continued with a
constant clearance angle  around the corner arcs of the 

insert (16) such that at any point along any of the
clearance faces and around the entire insert the same

first inserts cutting edge substantially in a common
plane passing through the shank axis (50) thereby

enabling the cutting tool to generate an arcuate cut of
substantially uniform radius.
Cutting tool as in claim 1,

a 30 degree positive angle.
An indexable cutting insert (16) for a cutting
tool (10), comprising:

flank surfaces (22) forming the sides of the polygon

with two of the flank surfaces intersecting at each
corner (24,25) thereof, the first major face (18)
