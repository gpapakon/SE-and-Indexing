<ABSTRACT>
A signal processor, which includes a plurality of signal processing circuits, outputs predetermined data 
passing sequentially through the signal processing circuits. The timing necessary for operation in the individual 

signal processing circuits is added as header information to the data transferred. In this way, the present invention 
makes it possible for each signal processing circuit to reliably process the data and to transfer the data while avoiding 

a complicated construction including a timing circuit for signal processing by each signal processing circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal
processing apparatus, and more particularly to an
improvement of recording or reproducing apparatus for a
digital video tape recorder (D-VTR) for discrete cosine
transforming (DCT) video signal in order to compress
amount of information thereof and recording it.Heretofore, as this type of D-VTR, there is one
shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, 1 generally denotes the D-VTR.
A digital video signal S1 (Fig. 2(B)) input from
a predetermined video signal generating unit is input
to a DCT shuffling circuit 2. The DCT shuffling
circuit 2 has a DCT address circuit 3 in association
therewith, a vertical synchronizing signal SV (Fig.
2(A)) is input to the DCT address circuit 3.Accordingly, the DCT shuffling circuit 2 divides
the digital video signal S1 into DCT blocks of 8 
columns x 4 rows for each one field by shuffle address
generated by the DCT address circuit 3 on the basis of
the vertical synchronizing signal SV. The DCT
shuffling circuit 2 collects 10 blocks of the DCT
blocks from their respective positions discretely
located from each other within a screen to generate
shuffle data S2 (Fig. 2(C)), and outputs the shuffle
data S2 to the following DCT conversion circuit 4.Here, the DCT shuffling circuit 2 performs
shuffling processing by each one field. Thereby, the
shuffle data S2 output from the DCT shuffling circuit 2
is supplied to the DCT conversion circuit 4 at a timing
delayed by one field time period T2 from the digital
video signal S1 as shown in Fig. 2(C).The DCT conversion circuit 4 performs discrete
cosine transform to data of each DCT block and supplies
DCT data S3 to a quantization delay circuit 5 and a
quantization level detecting circuit 6. The
quantization level detecting circuit 6 detects a
quantization level (quantization width) for achieving a
target compression rate for the DCT data S3. Since, at
this time, about ten-block time period is required as
the signal processing time in the quantization level
detecting circuit 6, the quantization delay circuit 5 
delays the DCT data S3 by the signal processing time,
and supplies it to a quantization circuit 7 as a
quantization delay output data S5. Accordingly, the
quantization delay output data S5 is input to the
quantization circuit 7 at the same timing as
quantization level data S4 which is output from the
quantization level detecting circuit 6 at a time point
t3 delayed by a 10-block time period T3 from the
shuffle data S2 as shown in Fig. 2(D).The quantization circuit 7 quantizes the
quantization delay
