<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a front support arrangement for the driver's cab of a lorry, comprising at least two support brackets (1) which are secured to the vehicle frame and to which the driver's cab is coupled at the front via corresponding supports. Each of the support brackets (1) comprises a support hoop (2) with a raised-up region (7) which can be deformed in a specific manner to the rear and upwards in the event of a large force acting from the front, and two side cheeks (3, 4), which are connected at the top of the raised-up support-hoop region (7) and between which a driver's cab support is accommodated, and which have predetermined folding zones (16, 17) which, in the event of a high force acting from above downwards or vice versa can be deformed in a specific manner. These support brackets (1) are designed in particular with regard to withstanding the extremely high stresses of a Swedish test and ECE test and to reducing a portion of the energy occurring during these.

Mounts arrangement at front for the cab of a truck with at least two mount 
consoles fitted to the vehicle frame, at which consoles the cab can be tilted 

at the front of by means of suitable mounts, characterised in that each of the 
mount consoles (1) consists of a mount bow (2) with a raised area (7; 8, 9, 

10) that can be purposefully deformed if force is exerted on it from the 
front, rear and top, and of two lateral faces (3, 4) that are fitted to the top of 

the raised mount bow area (7), accommodate a cab mount between them 
and have specified folding zones (16, 17) which, upon the impact of great 

force from the top downwards and vice versa, can be purposefully 
deformed. 
Mounts arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the mount 
bow (2) of each mount console (1) is made of one single piece and 

provided at the bottom with two mounting webs (5, 6) which are preferably 
in the same plane, supported on the vehicle frame and can be screwed on, 

and is also provided between said mounting webs (5, 6) with the raised 
area (7) which can be purposefully deformed and is equipped with a front 

leg (8) which, when viewed from the side, is approximately U-shaped, and 
with a rear leg (9) and a roof (10). 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the two legs (8, 9) of the U-shaped raised mount bow area (7) run 

approximately parallel to each other. 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the raised mount bow area (7) is tilted forwards in relation to the 

mounting plane. 
Mounts arrangement according to Claim 4, characterised in that the front 
leg (8) of the U-shaped raised mount bow area (7) is shorter than the rear 

leg (9) of said mount bow area. 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the Claims 3 and 4, characterised 
in that the two legs (8, 9) of the U-shaped raised mount bow area (7) run 

together at an acute angle.  
 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the foregoing Claims, 
characterised in that the roof (10) of the U-shaped raised mount bow area 

(7) is approximately vertical relative to the rear leg (9) of said mount bow 
area. 
Mounts arrangement according to Claim 6, characterised in that, relative to 
the mounting plane, the rear leg (9) of the forward-tilting U-shaped mount 

bow area (7) is at an angle of approximately 75°, whereas the front leg (8) 
is at an angle of approximately 45°. 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the foregoing Claims, 
characterised in that the transitions from each leg (8, 9) of the U-shaped 

raised mount bow area (7) to the mounting web (5, 6) and the roof (10) are 
arcs (11, 12, 13, 14) with a relatively large curvature radius. 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the foregoing Claims, 
characterised in that the mounts bow (2) of one mount console (1) is 

formed by a bending part of strip steel. 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that the mount bow (2) of one mount console (1) can be formed by a part 

sawn off a sectional steel piece that has the final shape of said mounts bow 

(2). 
Mounts arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the two 
lateral faces (3, 4) of one mount console (1) are formed and arranged in a 

mirror-symmetrical manner relative to the longitudinal centre plane (SL) of 
the mount bow (2). 
Mounts arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that, on the 
roof (10) of the U-shaped, raised mount bow area (7), the two lateral faces 

(3, 4) of one mount console (1) are welded to the top area or to the outer 
sides of said mount bow area (7) so that they point upwards and, if 

necessary, forwards at an oblique angle. 
Mounts arrangement according to Claim 1, characterised in that the folding 
zone (16, 17) in each literal face (3, 4) is formed by a bulge (18, 19) that 

extends over the full width of said faces (3, 4).  
 
Mounts arrangement according to Claim 14, characterised in that the bulges 
(16, 17) in both lateral faces (3, 4) of one mount console (1) run at least 

approximately parallel to the roof (10) of the U-shaped, raised mount bow 
area (7). 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the Claims 14 and 15, 
characterised in that the bulges (16, 17) in both lateral faces (3, 4) of one 

mount console (1) curve outwards. 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the Claims 14 to 16, characterised 
in that the sections (20, 21 and 22, 23 respectively) adjacent to the upper 

and lower ends of the respective bulge (16, 17) of one lateral face (3,4) are 
in the same plane. 
Mounts arrangement according to one of the Claims 12 to 17, characterised 
in that the two lateral faces (3, 4) of one mount console (1) are punched out 

of sheet steel and formed by means of a press.
