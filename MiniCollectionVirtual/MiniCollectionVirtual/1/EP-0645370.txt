<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds having 
pharmaceutical properties. The compounds of the invention are of the following general 
formula: 
in which A is 
B is 
R¹ to R⁸ are each hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl, m, n and p are 
each 0, 1, or 2, q is 0, 1, 2 or 3, X and Z are each C₁₋₄ 
alkyl, C₁₋₄ alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, cyano, halo, 
trihalomethyl, carboxy, C₁₋₄ alkoxy-carbonyl or phenyl, and 
in addition Z, together with the phenyl ring to which it is 
attached, can be: 
Y is -O-, -S- or -CH₂-, V is -(CH₂)r- or -(CH₂)rS- where r 
is 1 to 15, and W is hydrogen or optionally substituted 
phenyl; and salts thereof. The compounds of the invention are indicated for use in the 
treatment of diseases of the central nervous system. When reference is made to C₁₋₄ alkyl in the above formula, 
preferred groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl and 
tert.butyl. Especially preferred groups are methyl and 
ethyl. A C₁₋₄ alkoxy group is one such alkyl group linked 
via an oxygen atom. Preferred halo groups are fluoro, 
chloro and bromo, and trifluoromethyl is the preferred 
example of trihalomethyl. It is preferred that A and B are -NR³R⁴ and -NR⁵R⁶ 
respectively, and that R³, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are each hydrogen 
or methyl. Also it is preferred that R⁷ and R⁸ are both 
hydrogen. The groups R¹ and R² are preferably hydrogen, 
and both m and p are preferably 1. The value of n is 
preferably 0 or 1, and Y is preferably -O-. An optionally substituted phenyl is preferably 
unsubstituted phenyl and can also be phenyl substituted 
with one or more substituents, preferably one or two 
substituents, selected from halo, preferably fluoro or 
chloro, trifluoromethyl, C₁₋₄ alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, C₁₋₄ 
alkyl, C₁₋₄ alkylthio and carboxy. The group V is preferably -(CH₂)r-, and W is preferably 
hydrogen.  A preferred group of compounds is of the general formula: 
in which R⁹ is C₁₋₄ alkyl, especially methyl, n is 0 or 1, 
X is C₁₋₄ alkyl, r is 3 to 10, Z is C₁₋₄ alkyl, C₁₋₄ alkoxy, 
hydroxy, nitro, cyano, halo, trihalomethyl, carboxy, C₁₋₄ 
alkoxycarbonyl or phenyl, and q is 0, 1 or 2; and salts 
thereof. It will be understood that salts of the compounds of the 
invention can be prepared, and such salts are included in 
the invention. They can be any of the well known acid or 
base addition salts. Acid addition salts are preferably 
the pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic addition salts 
with suitable acids, such as those with inorganic acids, 
for example hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, sulphuric or 
phosphoric acids, or
