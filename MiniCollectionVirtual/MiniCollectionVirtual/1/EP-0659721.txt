Process for the oxidation of olefinic terpenes with
oxygen under the influence of light, characterized

in that no more than 10 % of the total energy of the
light emitted is apportioned to the wavelength range

of 200 to 400 nm, based on the wavelength range of
200 to 700 nm radiated by the light source, and the

irradiation intensity is chosen so that the reaction
achieves a conversion rate of 95 % in less than

12 hours.
Process according to Claim 1, wherein an irradiation
intensity of 5 to 200 suns is used.
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, wherein no more
than 1 % of the total energy of the emitted light is

apportioned to the wavelength range of 200 to
300 nm, based on the wavelength range of 200 to

700 nm radiated by the light source.
Process for the preparation of terpene alcohols,
wherein olefinic terpenes, in accordance with the

process according to Claims 1 - 3, are oxidized to
terpene hydroperoxides and these are reduced to

terpene alcohols.
Process for the preparation of rose oxide, wherein
citronellol, in accordance with the process according 

to Claims 1 - 3, is oxidized to 3,7-dimethyl-5-octene-1,7-diol,
and this is cyclized to give rose

oxide.
Process for the preparation of sabinene hydrate,
wherein α-thujene, in accordance with the process

according to Claims 1 - 3, is oxidized, the
resulting hydroperoxide is reduced to 4-hydroxy-β-thujene

and this is hydrogenated to give sabinene
hydrate.
Process for the preparation of nerol oxide, wherein
nerol, in accordance with the process according to

Claims 1 - 3, is oxidized, the resulting hydroperoxide
is reduced to 3,7-dimethyl-2,5-octadiene-1,7-diol

and this is cyclized to give nerol oxide.
Process for the preparation of 4-terpineol, wherein
terpinols, in accordance with the process according

to Claims 1 - 3, are oxidized, the resulting hydroperoxide
is reduced to p-mentha-1,8-dien-4-ol, and

this is hydrogenated to give 4-terpineol.
