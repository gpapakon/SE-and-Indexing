<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor integrated circuit device produces an 
internal step-down power voltage (Vint) from an external 

voltage (Vext) for selectively distributing the internal 
step-down power voltage (Vint) and the external voltage 

(Vext) to the circuit components thereof, and a built-in 
step-down voltage generator (26) has two internal voltage 

generating circuits selectively enabled with a control 
signal (Sdc) for a standard data access mode and a burn-in 

test operation, wherein a premonitoring circuit (24) 
activates a current mirror circuit (25a) for producing the 

control signal (Sdc) when the external voltage (Vext) 
becomes close to an accelerating voltage range for the 

burn-in test operation, thereby decreasing standby current 
in the standard data access mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated
circuit device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor
integrated circuit device having a low power consumption
voltage monitoring circuit for built-in step-down voltage
generator.The semiconductor integrated circuit device such as a
semiconductor memory device progressively increases the
integration density through miniaturization of the circuit
components. However, miniaturized transistors encounter a
problem in reliability due to hot carriers and short the
channel effect. The problem is avoidable by decreasing a
power voltage level. However, it is impossible to decrease
the power voltage level for only the semiconductor memory
device, because a dual power supply system is complex and
expensive.In order to share a single power supply system
between the semiconductor memory device and the other
system components without the problem, it is proposed to 
provide a built-in step-down voltage generator in the
semiconductor memory device. The built-in step-down
voltage generator is arranged in such a manner as to keep
the output voltage level or the internal step-down power
voltage at a constant voltage level after the external
power voltage exceeds a predetermined voltage level,
typically, at 3.5 volts.However, such an built-in step-down voltage generator
is not desirable for a burn-in test operation, because the
built-in step-down voltage generator prevents the circuit
components from an excess voltage for the burn-in test
operation.A built-in step-down voltage generator acknowledges
the burn-in test operation when a diagnostic system applies
an excess voltage over a recommended voltage range to a
power voltage pin of the semiconductor memory device, and
allows the internal power voltage to rise over the constant
level depending upon the applied voltage level.Fig. 1 illustrates a typical example of the
semiconductor memory device with the built-in step-down
voltage generator. Reference numeral 1 designates the
built-in step-down voltage generator, and is broken down
into a first internal voltage generating circuit 2 and a 
second internal voltage generating circuit 3. Though not
shown in the figure, a voltage monitoring circuit checks an
external voltage pin whether or not the external voltage
Vext exceeds the recommended voltage range, and changes a
control signal Sdc from a low voltage level to a high
voltage level when the external voltage is lifted over the
recommended voltage range for the burn-in test operation.
The control signal Sdc and the
