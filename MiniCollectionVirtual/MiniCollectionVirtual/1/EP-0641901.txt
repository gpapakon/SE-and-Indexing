<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an assembly construction system for erecting a wooden house in a modular manner which rectangular panel elements (9) with solid, continuous, spaced-apart and mutually parallel load-bearing members (3, 4, 8) consisting of solid wood on two first sides of the relevant panel element (9), which form a module via the panels (1, 2) connected to the load-bearing members (3, 4, 8) and positioned on the load-bearing members (3, 4, 8), wherein, in order to form a groove/tongue connection between two of the panel elements (9, 9), one of the load-bearing members (4) projects beyond the panels (1, 2) and the other load-bearing member (3) is set back with respect to the panels (1, 2) by a corresponding amount, and wherein the panels (1, 2), on the two second sides at right angles thereto, project beyond the load-bearing members (3, 4, 8) in order to form receiving means (10, 11) which run continuously in the longitudinal direction and into which there may be introduced alignment planks (12, 13) which run continuously in the longitudinal direction and align the mutually abutting panel elements (9, 9), connected to one another via the groove/tongue connection (6, 7), with respect to one another on the second sides, characterised in that the alignment planks (12, 13) are of rectangular cross-sections and are dimensioned such that they can be introduced into the receiving means (10, 11), between the panels (1, 2) and such that they bear against the inner sides thereof, wherein, in order to receive supply lines (37), at least one continuous free space (36, 38) is formed between one of the alignment planks (12, 13) and the relevant ends of the load-bearing members (3, 4, 8).

Assembly construction system for erecting a wooden house of modular design with
rectangular panel elements (9) by the building block method, with solid, continuous,

separated and parallel beams (3, 4, 8) of solid timber, on two first sides of the panel
element concerned (9), which panel elements form a box by means of panels (1, 2)

connected to the beams (3, 4, 8) and placed on the beams (3, 4, 8), where one of the
beams (4) projects beyond the panels (1, 2), to form a tongue and groove joint between

two of the panel elements (9) of one of the beams (4), where the other beam (3) is offset
by a corresponding amount from the panels (1, 2), and where the panels (1, 2) on the other

two sides at right angles to it project from the beams (3, 4, 8) to form recesses (10, 11)
running in the longitudinal direction, into which are inserted guiding planks (12, 13)

running in the longitudinal direction of the other two sides, and forming part of guiding
plank arrangements, which planks align on the other two sides the panel elements (9)

placed one on top of the other and connected by a tongue and groove joint (6, 7), where
the guiding planks (12, 13) have rectangular cross-sections and are dimensioned so that

they are inserted in the recesses (10, 11) between the panels, and rest against their insides,
and where at least one continuous clearance (36, 38) is formed between one of the guiding

planks (12, 13) and the corresponding ends of the beams (3, 4, 8),
characterised
 in that

the guiding beam arrangements consist of only one of the guiding planks (12, 13)
mentioned, in that the ends of the beams (3, 4, 8) form a support (3, 9) for the guiding

plank (13) provided there, on top of the panel element (9), in that the top of the panel
element (9) is open between the beams (3, 4, 8), and in that the clearance (38) is formed

so that it enables feed cables (37) to be received.
Assembly construction system according to Claim 1,
characterised
 in that

the beams (3, 4) placed one against the other are glued firmly together throughout their
surface.
Assembly construction system according to Claim 2,
characterised
 in that

tension rods (14, 25, 34) are provided which also connect the beams (3, 4) placed one
against the other.
Assembly construction system according to Claim 3,
characterised
 in that

the tension rods (34) are composed of rod elements which are bolted together.
Assembly construction system according to Claim 4,
characterised
 in that

the rod elements (34) exhibit at their end a contact surface (32).
Assembly construction system according to Claim 5,
characterised
 in that

the clamping elements are designed as bolts (25) to one of whose end is secured a locating
element (26, 29) which is able to assume an insertion position (A) in which, together with

the bolt (25) and attached to it, it can be pushed through holes (5) in the beams (3, 4, 8)
with a semi-circular profile lying flush with each other, as well as a contact position (B),

in which it rests against the corresponding surface of the beam (3, 4).
Assembly construction system according to Claim 6,
characterised
 in that

the locating element (26, 29) may be swivelled about a shaft (28) on the bolt (25), which
shaft runs asymmetrically in relation to the locating element (26, 29) so that the locating

element (26, 28, 29) is swivelled approximately 180Â° about its longitudinal axis, by its
own weight, from the insertion position (A) (to the contact position (B), when the bolt

(25) is rotated.
Assembly construction system according to Claim 6 or 7,
characterised
 in that

at least one tip is provided on the locating element (26) for engaging in the beam (3, 4). 
Assembly construction system according to one of Claims 6 to 8,
characterised
 in that

the locating element is designed as an oblong U profile (29) with a swivel axis in the
lateral walls of the U profile (29), or in a side elevation, roughly as a Z-profile (26) with a

slot (28) for fitting on to the bolt (25).
