<ABSTRACT>
In modern washing machines, the washing and rinsing cycles are monitored with the aid of an electronic control unit and optimised with respect to power and water consumption. So-called turbidity sensors (nephelometers) which usually consist of a light-emitting diode and a photosensitive element are used as measured-value generators. The subject matter of the invention is an optical sensor which allows unambiguous establishment of whether a measuring tube contains air or water or turbid soapy water. According to the invention, the measuring tube (3) of the optical sensor has a slightly spherical inward curve respectively in the region of the entering and emerging beam pencil (4, 4'). When filled with water, the measuring tube (3) then acts as a weak diverging lens which broadens the beam pencil (4') in the region of the phototransistor (2). Almost no lens action is developed by the measuring tube (3) when it is filled with air. It allows the radiation (4) to reach the phototransistor (2) undeviated, and the latter measures a correspondingly higher intensity in this case. The turbidity sensor can be used for washing and rinsing machines, sewage monitoring systems and medical devices.

<CLAIMS>
Optical sensor, with a radiation source (1)
producing a beam (4), a radiation-sensitive detector

(2), and a container (3) which is filled with a gaseous
and/or liquid medium and is arranged in such a way with

respect to the radiation source (1) and the detector
(2) that a beam (4) emanating from the radiation source

(1) passes through the container (3) and reaches the
detector (2), 
characterized in that
 the wall of the
container (3) is curved spherically inwards both in the

region of the entering beam (4) and in the region of
the exiting beam (4'), with the wall thickness

remaining the same, so that the liquid-filled container
(3) acts as a diverging lens.
Optical sensor, with a radiation source (1)
producing a beam (4), a radiation-sensitive detector

(2), and a container (3) which is filled with a gaseous
and/or liquid medium and is arranged in such a way with

respect to the radiation source (1) and the detector
(2) that a beam (4) emanating from the radiation source

(1) passes through the container (3) and reaches the
detector (2), 
characterized in that
 the wall of the
container (16) is formed as a plane-parallel surface

(14, 15) in the region of the entering beam (4) and in
the region of the exiting beam (4') and in that a plane

or biconvex lens (13) is arranged within the container
(16) in the beam between the plane-parallel surfaces

(14, 15), so that an air-filled container (16) acts 
with a greater focusing effect than a liquid-filled

container (16) .
Optical sensor according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the container (3, 16) consists of
glass or a transparent plastic.
Optical sensor according to one of Claims 1 to
3, 
characterized by
 a light-emitting diode or
incandescent lamp as the radiation source (1).
Optical sensor according to one of Claims 1 to
4, 
characterized by
 a photodiode, a phototransistor or
a photoresistor as the detector (2).
Use of an optical sensor according to one of
the preceding claims as a turbidity sensor and/or

protection against running-dry in a washing machine or
dishwasher.
