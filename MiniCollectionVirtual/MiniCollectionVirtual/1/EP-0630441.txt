<ABSTRACT>
A rotary compressor and method of operation is provided having a housing including a bore (16), bearings (39, 42), a low pressure end (18) and a high pressure end (20). A rotor is rotatably mounted by the bearings and has an end face subject to a variable axial thrust force; and a plurality of compression chambers (86-89) having a low pressure, a high pressure and intermediate pressures. A piston (162) is provided for exerting a counterbalancing force on the rotor in opposition to the axial thrust force at the high pressure end of the compressor. An intermediate pressure port (90) is provided in communication with the intermediate pressure chamber. A conduit (96) is connected between the piston and the intermediate pressure port which varies according to suction pressure to cause the piston to apply a variable counterbalance force on the rotor through the output range of the compressor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to rotary screw compressors,
and more particularly to a compressor and a method of
operation that will provide automatic compensation
against axial thrust forces imposed on the compressor
rotor bearings, as set out in claims 1 and 6.Rotary screw compressors comprise a housing with
working fluid inlet and outlets, rotor bores and a rotor
assembly mounted on bearings for rotation in the rotor
bores. The rotor may comprise a single rotor or male and
female screw-type rotors having intermeshed lands and
grooves. Rotation of the rotor causes a working fluid to
be taken from the low pressure inlet or suction side, and
gradually compressed in chambers created by the lands and
grooves. The high pressure fluid is then discharged
through the high pressure outlet.The capacity of the compressor and the volume ratio
of the compressor, sometimes called compression ratio,
are controlled by various types of valve arrangements.
One type of valve arrangement used to regulate the
capacity and volume ratio is termed a slide valve. If a
slide valve is used, the compressor housing is provided
with a slide valve receiving recess which connects the
rotor bores in fluid communication with the low pressure
inlet. The slide valve is mounted and operative to
either close this recess or open it thereby providing a
variable size bypass opening to bypass some compressed 
fluid back to this inlet to control the compressor
capacity.The volume ratio of the compressor depends upon the
period of time fluid remains trapped in the rotor
chambers. As the rotors rotate, the rotor chambers
become progressively smaller which reduces the volume of
the fluid therein and increases its pressure. Therefore,
the longer the period of time that fluid remains trapped
in the rotor chambers, the smaller its volume becomes.
The slide valve is adjustable to regulate the period of
time fluid is trapped in the rotor chambers and
increasing or decreasing retention time increases or
decreases the compressor volume ratio.An inherent differential pressure ΔP exists between
the low pressure inlet and the high pressure outlet sides
of the compressor. This ▵P pressure acts against the end
faces of the rotors and generates axial thrust forces
tending to move the rotors toward the low pressure inlet
side. These axial thrust forces must be absorbed by the
bearings and such forces can generate extremely high
axial bearing loads which overload the bearings under
many normal operating parameters. However, under other
operating parameters very little
