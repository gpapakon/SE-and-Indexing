<CLAIMS>
Pourable and free-flowing granules which contain as their principal 
component bleach activators for the washing of laundry embedded as a finely 

dispersed solid phase in a substantially water-free phase permeating the 
granules and serving as binder and which are produced by extrusion of a 

substantially water-free mixture of bleach activator, anionic surfactant, 
solubilizing aid and optionally other additives, characterized in that the 

solubilizing aid is selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol, 
polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol anionically modified at one or both 

hydroxyl groups, polypropylene glycol anionically modified at one or both hydroxyl 
groups and mixtures of these compounds. 
Granules as claimed in claim 1 containing water-soluble alkali metal salt 
as a further additive. 
Granules as claimed in claim 1 or 2 containing 

70 to 95% by weight of bleach activator 
4 to 25% by weight of anionic surfactant 
0.5 to 15% by weight of solubilizing aid 
0 to 10% by weight of alkali metal salt. 
Granules as claimed in claim 3 containing 

75 to 90% by weight of bleach activator 
6 to 15% by weight of anionic surfactant 
1 to 6% by weight of solubilizing aid 
0.5 to 5% by weight of alkali metal salt. 
Granules as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the bleach activator is 
selected from the group consisting of pentaacetyl glucose, tetraacetyl 

ethylenediamine, 1,5-diacetyl-2,4-dioxohexahydro-1,3,5-triazine and mixtures 
thereof.  

 
Granules as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the anionic surfactant is 
selected from the group consisting of C
12-18
 fatty alcohol sulfates, 
alkylbenzenesulfonates containing 9 to 13 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, α-sulfofatty 

acid methyl esters containing 12 to 18 carbon atoms in the carboxylic 
acid component and mixtures thereof. 
Granules as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the solubilizing aid is 
selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, 

sulfates and/or disulfates of polyethylene glycol or polypropylene glycol, 
sulfosuccinates and/or disulfosuccinates of polyethylene glycol or polypropylene 

glycol and mixtures thereof. 
Granules as claimed in claim 2, in which the alkali metal salt is selected 
from the group consisting of sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium citrate 

and mixtures thereof. 
A process for the production of the bleach activator granules claimed in 
claim 1, in which the fine-particle bleach activator is mixed with the other 

components, the resulting mixture is homogenized, preferably at elevated 
temperature, to form a paste extrudable in strand form and the paste obtained 

is extruded in strand form under elevated pressure, the issuing strands are cut 
into short pieces, optionally after cooling, and the pieces obtained are optionally 

spheronized and, if desired, graded according to size. 
A process as claimed in claim 9, in which the working temperature is 
allowed to rise to a value of at most 80°C and preferably to a value of about 45 

to 75°C.
