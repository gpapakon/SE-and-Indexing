<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wrap-around carrier (34) with gusset panels (28) connected to the bottom panel (42) that automatically fold into their upright position when the bottom panel flaps are set up for locking engagement. The resulting upright portions of the gusset panels contact the bottom portions of adjacent articles in the carrier to prevent the articles from falling out through the ends of the carrier. The fold lines (32) connecting these gusset panels (28) to the side panels (18) are angled back to lengthen these fold lines while cutouts (60) in the gusset panels shorten the length of the other fold lines (62, 66) of the gusset panels. This increases the pulling power of the gusset panels while decreasing the bias force which must be overcome in order for the gusset panels to be folded into their upright position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wrap-around carrier according
to the preamble of claim 1, which carrier has means for
preventing the end articles from falling out of the carrier.
Furthermore this invention relates to a blank according to the
preamble of claim 6, which blank is designed for forming such a
carrier.Wrap-around carriers provide an inexpensive, effective
means for packaging articles, requiring blanks of only minimum
size which are capable of running on packaging machines at high
speeds. A wrap-around carrier is formed by first grouping the
articles to be packaged in the same arrangement they will have
in the package, then wrapping a carrier blank around the
articles and securing the ends of the blank together. Although
some wrap-around carriers include integral end panels, most are
open-ended. The articles are prevented from falling out through
the open ends by tightly wrapping the carrier blank around them
and also by designing the package so that the bottom portions
of the articles protrude through openings in the side panels of
the carrier. For example, cutouts in the side panels are
conventionally employed to receive the flanges of cans and
other flanged articles, while heel cutouts in the lower
portions of the side panels are employed to receive the heels
or bases of beverage bottles. A wrap-around carrier as set
forth in the preamble of claim 1 and a blank for forming same
are disclosed in EP-A-0509749. A similar wrap-around carrier
and blank respectively are known from US-A-5060792.While such known carriers perform well in containing cans
or bottles of traditional design, new bottle designs do not
always lend themselves to conventional treatment. the trend to
larger beverage bottles makes it incumbent to employ carriers
that are not only structurally capable of supporting heavier
loads but are able to positively prevent outward movement of
the end bottles. This becomes more difficult when the bottle
design is such that it no longer includes a conventionally
shaped heel which normally would be held in place by a heel 
cutout. The packaging of bottles provided with petaloid bottom
design, the bottom portions of which have an inward slope
instead of an outward slope, is particularly difficult in this
respect.It would be desirable to be able to employ wrap-around
carriers to package bottles and other articles whose design
makes it difficult or impossible to be held in place by side
panel cutouts, and to do so without danger of the articles
sliding out of the ends of the carrier. Accordingly
