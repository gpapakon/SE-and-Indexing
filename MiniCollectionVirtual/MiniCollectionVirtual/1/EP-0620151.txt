<ABSTRACT>
The film (F) fed to the packaging machine has a width 
suitable for wrapping articles whose sizes may vary over a 

wide range, and its width is made proportionate to the 
largest size of article which the machine can wrap. For the 

wrapping of articles whose dimensions are smaller than the 
maximum ones acceptable by the machine, the width of the 

film is modified as required to suit the dimensions of the 
article to be wrapped, by a pleating process 

(9-12-112-29-129-229) such that the longitudinal axis of the 
pleats lies in the direction of the length of the section of 

film introduced into the wrapping station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and apparatus 
for wrapping with stretchable film articles having different 
dimensions. According to document EP-A-0 434 947 there is disclosed 
an apparatus for wrapping articles having different 
dimensions with stretchable film to form packages 
automatically made proportionate to the sizes of the 
article, in which the dimensions of the specific article to 
be wrapped are measured, a portion of film having a length 
proportionate to the sizes of the article is fed to a 
wrapping station, the article is lifted against said portion 
of film whose flaps are then folded and extended under 
tension onto the base of the article. The process and apparatus according to the present 
invention contemplates a packaging machine of the type 
disclosed above, which is characterized by the feature that, 
prior to the feeding of the film to the wrapping station, 
the width of the film is adapted to the dimensions of the 
article to be wrapped so that the final flap of film 
extended on the base of the article is comprised within the 
width of said base. The said adapting operation of the width 
of the wrapping film is effected by forming pleats in the 
film. The pleats are formed so that their longitudinal axis 
lies in the direction of the length of the section of film 
introduced into the wrapping station.  
 The pleating operation is performed by variable pleating 
means controlled by the means which measure the size of the 
specific article which is fed to the wrapping station of the

A process for wrapping articles (P) having different 
dimensions with stretchable film (F) to form packages 

automatically made proportionate to the sizes of the 
article, in which the dimensions of the specific article (P) 

to be wrapped are measured, a portion of film having a 
length proportionate to the size of the article (P) is fed 

to a wrapping station, the article is lifted against said 
portion of film whose flaps are then folded and extended 

under tension onto the base of the article according to a 
sequence which terminates with the folding of a final flap 

onto previously folded flaps,
 
characterized by the fact that
 
prior to the feeding of the film (F) to the wrapping 

station, the width of the film is adapted to the dimensions 
of the article (P) to be wrapped so that the said final flap 

of film extended on the base of the article is comprised 
within the width of said base, the said adapting of the 

width of the wrapping film being effected by forming pleats 
in said film, the said pleats being orientated with their 

longitudinal direction in the direction of the length of the 
film.  

 
An apparatus for carrying out the process according 
to claim 1, comprising measuring means (5-105) which measure 

the dimensions of the article (P) fed to the wrapping 
station of the machine and which transmit these data to a 

processing unit which controls pleating means (12-112) which 
operate between a film feed supply source (B) and the 

wrapping station of the machine, to subject the section of 
film which has to be introduced into the said wrapping 

station to a pleating operation, if necessary such that the 
section of film fed to the said wrapping station has a width 

substantially equal to the width of the article to be 
wrapped. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, in which the pleating 
means comprise at least one long flat fixed guide (9) on 

which or under which a median portion of the film from the 
roll slides longitudinally, provision being made to enable 

the flaps of film projecting laterally from the said guide 
to be partly folded under or above the said guide by means  

 
of corresponding side pleating guides (12-112) connected to 

means of any type capable of modifying the distance between 
said side guides with a self-centring movement, provision 

being made to ensure that the side flaps of the film not 
controlled by the aforesaid guides and leaving these guides 

are controlled by any suitable clamping means (29-129-229) 
such that the film can slide longitudinally between these 

clamping means substantially without friction, while the 
film is held transversely by friction between these clamping 

means which are connected to means of any suitable type 
capable of changing the distance between them with a 

self-centring movement twice as great as the movement of the 
said movable side pleating guides (12-112), means being 

provided to synchronise the self-centring movements of said 
side pleating guides and of said clamping means. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, in which the said 
clamp means which control the side flaps of the film leaving 

the pleating guides (9-12-112) comprise rubber-covered 
rollers (29-129) of which there is at least one for each of 

the said flaps, disposed with their axis parallel to a 
dispenser (30) to which the film of variable width is to be 

fed, and which dispenses the film to the wrapping station. 
Apparatus according to the claim 3, in which the 
clamp means which control the side flaps of the film leaving 

the pleating guides comprise rubber-covered rollers (29-129) 
of which there is one for each of the said flaps, parallel 

to the dispenser (30) to which they feed the film of 
variable width, and connected to the means of self-centring  

 
movement, with the provision, in opposition and parallel to 

these rollers, of a sprung smooth-surfaced roller (229) 
freely rotatable, and having the function of maintaining the 

contact of the flaps of the film with the said 
rubber-covered rollers while not opposing either the 

longitudinal movement of the film towards the wrapping 
machine or the transverse movement of the film following the 

self-centring movement of the rubber-covered rollers and of 
the pleating guides. 
Apparatus according to the claim 7, in which the 
steel roller (229) is diaposed above the film and is 

supported with springing, for contact with the film, by 
oscillating end levers (31) which enable this roller to be
