<ABSTRACT>
The control device has an electronic control stage (2) used in combination with an electromechanical programme switch mechanism (1) with a programme drum (3), a reversing drum (4) and an operating drive (5). The reversing drum has right-hand rotation, standstill and left-hand rotation contacts, with a control contact (S1) for a door locking mechanism (16) closed upon operation of the left-hand or right-hand rotation contact (9,10).

Control means for a washing machine or a drier which displays control electronics
(2) and an electromechanical microcontroller (1) with a program drum (3) and

with a reversing drum (4) together with a driving means (5), whereby the
reversing drum (4) controls reversing contacts (9, 10) for right-hand running,

stopping and left-hand running of a washing drum motor,
characterised in that

the reversing drum (4) is assigned to an operating contact (S 1) for a door locking
device (16), with which the door locking device (16) can be switched on or off,

whereby the operating contact (S1) of the reversing drum (4) is closed and

thereby the door locking device (16) is activated when the reversing contacts (9,
10) are switched to right-hand or left-hand running, while the door locking device

(16) can be inactivated when the operating contact (S1) is of the reversing drum
(4) is opened with the reversing contacts (9, 10) switched to stop.
Control means according to Claim 1,
characterised in that

the reversing drum (4) displays a cam disc to control the operating contact (S1).
Control means according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that

the door locking device (16) displays a delay element (17), which defmes a
holding time (t
H
).
Control means according to claim 2 or 3
characterised in that

on the cam disc serving to control the operating contact (S1), within a program
step in which the cyclical functions of right-hand running-stop-left-hand running-stop

are triggered several times, a door-opening step (TO) is provided in at least
one stop step. 
Control means according to claim 3 or 4,
characterised in that

by halting the driving means (5) in the door-opening step (TO) for a period which
is longer than the holding time (t
H
), the door locking device (16) is inactivated.
Control means according to claims 3, 4 and 5,
characterised in that

when the door locking device (16) is intended to remain active, the door-opening
step (TO) is overridden by the driving means (5) not being stopped for a period

which is longer than the holding time (t
H
).
Control means according to one of the preceding claims
characterised in that

the driving means (5) is designed such that in an OFF-step of the
electromechanical microcontroller (1) in which the reversing drum (4) opens the

operating contact (S1), the program drum (3) cannot continue to rotate
independently.
