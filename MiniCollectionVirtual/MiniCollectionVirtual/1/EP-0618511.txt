<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for
developing electrostatic images used in image forming
methods, such as electrophotography, electrostatic
recording and magnetic recording, and also an image
forming method using the toner.Hitherto, a large number of electrophotographic
processes have been known, inclusive of those
disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,297,691; 3,666,363;
and 4,071,361. In these processes, in general, an
electrostatic latent image is formed on a
photosensitive member comprising a photoconductive
material by various means, then the latent image is
developed with a toner, and the resultant toner image
is, after being transferred onto a transfer material
such as paper, as desired, fixed by heating, pressing,
or heating and pressing, or with solvent vapor to
obtain a copy. The residual toner on the
photosensitive member without being transferred is
cleaned by various methods, and then the above steps
are repeated.In recent years, such an electrophotographic
image forming apparatus has been required to satisfy
serious requirements regarding a smaller size, a 
smaller weight, a higher speed and a higher
reliability, and accordingly a toner is required to
show higher performances. For example, regarding the
step of fixing a toner image onto a sheet such as
paper, various methods and apparatus have been
developed. Among these, the most popular is the hot
pressure fixing system using hot rollers. In the
heat-fixing system using such hot rollers, a sheet
carrying a toner image to be fixed (hereinafter called
"fixation sheet") is passed, while the surface of a
hot roller having a releasability with the toner is
caused to contact the toner image surface of the
fixation sheet under pressure, to fix the toner image.
In this method, as the hot roller surface and the
toner image on the fixation sheet contact each other
under a pressure, a very good heat efficiency is
attained for melt-fixing the toner image onto the
fixation sheet to afford quick fixation, so that the
method is very effective in a high-speed
electrophotographic copying machine.However, the above-mentioned hot roller
fixation system frequently used heretofore has left
the following problems.
(1) There is required a so-called waiting time
within which image formation is not allowed, until the
hot rollers reach a prescribed temperature.(2) It is necessary to keep the hot rollers at an 
optimum temperature so as to prevent fixation failure
and offsetting of a toner onto the hot rollers caused
by a change in hot roller temperature due
