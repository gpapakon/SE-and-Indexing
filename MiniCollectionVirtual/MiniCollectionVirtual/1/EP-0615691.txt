<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cheese having anchored thereto 
a cheese skin for the moisture regulation and protection 

against microbial influences, obtainable by treating the 
cheese, after brining, with an aqueous solution of a water-soluble 

alginate, directly followed by drying this alginate 
solution such that the alginate solution forms, together with 

calcium ions from the cheese, a cheese skin anchored to the 

cheese. According to the invention, by the term alginate is 
meant a hydrocolloid or macromolecular polysaccharide 

substantially composed of molecules of mannuronic acid and/or 
glucuronic acid. The invention also comprises a method of 

manufacturing such cheeses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cheese skin for moisture 
regulation and protection against microbial influences, and to 
a method of providing a cheese skin on cheese. It is generally known (see, for instance, Dr. Heinrich 
Mair-Waldburg, Handbuch der Käse, (1974), 
Volkswirtschaftlicher Verlag GmbH, Kempten (Allgäu), Germany, 
in particular pages 220-221 and 254-255) that after brining, 
cheese, and in particular hard cheese, for instance Emmental, 
and cutting cheese, for instance Edam, is packed to control 
maturation. This packing is carried out in order to prevent 
losses of weight due to an excess degree of evaporation, and 
to protect the cheese surface against microbial influences, 
such as fungoid growth. Also, in the case of packed cheeses, a 
less thick rind is formed, resulting in less cheese waste. In 
this manner, the provision of a packing material round 
maturing cheese reduces the cost of the care of cheese. As packing material, many different materials are used, 
such as shrink film, for instance laquered aluminum foil or 
aluminum foil provided with a wax coat on the inside thereof, 
cellophane and films of various synthetic substances, such as 
polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene and polyamide. Depending 
on the nature of the cheese, these materials can be chosen 
from for controlling maturation, in which connection the 
permeability to water vapor, oxygen and carbon dioxide play a 
particular part. The conventional cheese packing materials have a number 
of drawbacks. The materials mentioned should be removed for 
consumption. For this reason these materials are referred to 
as packing materials. Further, it is usually necessary to add 
a microbicide agent in order to prevent fungoid growth or 
spoilage through bacteria. Moreover, when these known packing 
materials are used, it is complicated to regulate the loss of 
moisture during maturation. For this purpose, it is necessary 
either to modify the packing material by including admixtures  
 
in the film which modify the permeability, or to apply layers 
having different properties. These drawbacks are substantially overcome by covering 
cheeses with a layer consisting of calcium alginate or another 
metal alginate forming a water-insoluble layer. Such cheeses 
provided with a separate insoluble alginate layer are 
disclosed in German patent specification 858 631. The 
insoluble layer can be provided on the cheeses by providing on 
the cheese a water-soluble alginate and subsequently treating 
the cheese with a salt whose anion
