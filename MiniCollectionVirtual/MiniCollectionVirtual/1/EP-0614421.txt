<ABSTRACT>
A rear suspension for a vehicle including an axle beam (1) transversely arranged with respect to the car body where wheels (2) are mounted on both ends of the axle beam (1); trailing arms (4) projecting forward from both ends of the axle beam (1), the trailing arm's front end portion with respect to the car body being connected to the car body; upper and lower control links (10, 11) connecting a front end of the trailing arm (4) to the car body, the upper and lower control links (10, 11) having an interval therebetween; and spring-damper assemblies mounted perpendicularly at both ends of the axle beam, an upper portion (5) of each spring-damper assembly being connected to the car body, wherein optimal geometric characteristics are realized by easily to determining a variation of a wheel base and anti-lift and anti-squat characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rear 
suspension for a vehicle and, more particularly, to a 
rear suspension which is capable of obtaining an optimal 
geometric characteristic such that a free lay out degree 
for establishing a trailing arm mounting position can 
be increased to easily establish anti-lift and anti-squat 
characteristics, and a variable condition of a 
wheel base. A conventional suspension for a vehicle connects 
an axle shaft and a car body to each other, and controls 
a position of a tire with respect to the car body for 
its ideal position during running of the vehicle. 
Thus, optimal handling safety may be obtained, the axle 
shaft is prevented from directly transmitting an impact 
or vibration from a road surface to the car body. The 
suspension also prevents damage of baggage, whereby 
improving riding comfort. A conventional rear suspension for vehicle 
having a trailing arm is illustrated in FIG. 4, in which 
a wheel 51 is mounted on both ends of an axle beam 50 
transversely arranged with respect to the car body 53, a 
front end of a trailing arm 52 projecting from the both  
 
ends of the axle beam forward is connected to the car 
body, and an absorbing means 54 connects the axle beam 
50 to the car body 53. In the above described suspension, when a 
vibration generated from the road surface is transmitted 
to the wheel 51, the trailing arm is pivoted round the 
its front end of the connecting portion 55 as a center 
and the vibration is then absorbed by the absorbing 
means 54. However, in the above conventional suspension, 
once the position of the connecting portion 55 of the 
trailing arm is determined, since the up-down tracing 
movement M of the wheel 51 is determined in accordance 
with the trailing arm's length and position of the 
connecting portion 55, and then anti-lift and anti-squat 
characteristics as well as variation of a wheel base is 
automatically determined, so that the suspension has 
many restrictions in its design for obtaining the 
variable and pertinent geometric characteristics. That is to say, the suspension has to be 
designed within a limited space due to design of the car 
body. Because of this limitation, to obtain the 
pertinent mechanical characteristics, if the connecting 
portion 55 of the trailing arm 52 is to be formed at a 
lower position, it has a bad effect on road clearance. 
If the connecting portion 55 of the trailing arm 52 is  
 
to be formed at a higher position, there are some 
interferences with the floor of the vehicle.

<CLAIMS>
A rear suspension for a vehicle comprising: 

an axle beam (1) transversely arranged with 
respect to the car body and including wheels (2) mounted 

on both ends of said axle beam; 
spring-damper assemblies (5) mounted 
perpendicularly to both ends of said axle beam, an upper 

control portion of said spring-damper assemblies being 
connected to the car body; 
a trailing arm (4) projecting forward from said 
axle beam and integrally forming upper and lower pivot 

joint portions (21, 22) on a front end portion of said 
trailing arm; 
 
   characterised by upper and lower control links 

(10, 11) connecting the front end portion of said 
trailing arm to the car body, said upper and lower 

control links having a predetermined interval 
therebetween wherein an interval between a front end 

coupling portion (14) of the upper control link and a 
front end coupling portion (15) of the lower control 

link is narrower than that between a rear end coupling 
portion (12) of the upper control link and a rear end 

coupling portion (13) of the lower control link. 
The rear suspension for a vehicle as claimed in 
claim 1, wherein the rear end coupling portion of said  

 
upper control link is pivotally coupled to the upper 

portion of the front end portion of said trailing arm 
and the front end coupling portion is pivotally coupled 

to the car body; and
 
   wherein the rear end coupling portion of said 

lower control link is pivotally coupled to the lower 
portion of the front end portion of said trailing arm 

and the front end coupling portion is pivotally coupled 
to the car body. 
The rear suspension for a vehicle as claimed in 
claim 1 or 2, wherein each rear end coupling portion 

(12, 13) of the upper and rear control links (10, 11) is 
pivotally coupled to a connecting means (20) mounted on 

the front end portion of said trailing arm. 
The rear suspension for a vehicle as claimed in 
claim 2, wherein each front end coupling portion (14, 

15) of the upper and lower control links is pivotally 
linked to a mounting bracket (25) mounted on the car 

body. 
The rear suspension for a vehicle as claimed in 
claim 3, wherein the connecting means (20) includes an 

upper pivot joint portion (21') coupled to the rear end 
coupling portion (12) of said upper control link by a 

bolt (24), a lower pivot joint portion (22') coupled to 
the rear end coupling portion of said lower control link 

by a bolt (24'), and a plurality of holes (23) coupled  
 

to a corresponding plurality of holes (23') formed on 
the front end portion of said trailing arm by a bolt. 
The rear suspension for a vehicle as claimed in 
any one of claims 1 to 5, in which a longitudinal length 

of the upper control link (10) is less than that of the 
lower control link (11).
