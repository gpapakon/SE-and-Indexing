<ABSTRACT>
Load-dependent electrical safety fuse having an electronic ceramic (12) in a housing (11) from which connecting lines (14) are passed, for determining at least a first type of load of a device to be monitored, use being made of a ceramic, in brief a TDR ceramic (12), the electrically insulating state of which enters a semiconducting state as a function of time as a first type of load and of a second type of load. As a consequence, when the TDR ceramic (12) is supplied with DC voltage U via connecting lines (14), a current increase forms the trigger criterion which is met in the event of predeterminable conditions and determines a desired operating time  tau .

A load-controlled preventive fuse for monitoring a desired operating time τ,
comprising a ceramic resistive body (12) whose electric resistance changes, in dependence

upon a period of time and a second type of load, from an initially insulating state with a
high resistance value to a semiconducting state with a lower resistance value, while a dc

voltage is applied to the resistive body, and comprising electrodes (17) for applying the dc
voltage to the resistive body during said period of time, means for measuring the resistance

of the ceramic resistive body, and an evaluation unit for monitoring a transition of the
resistance value of the resistive body.
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the operating
time τ, 
i.e.
 the fulfilment of the activation criterion, is governed by the first and the second
type of load of the applied dc voltage U and by the interspace d between electrodes (17) on

and/or in the TDR ceramic (12).
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 on the basis of
the ceramic material the first type of load causes a dependence on time and the second type

of load causes a dependence on temperature, and the connection between the dependence
on time and the dependence on temperature can be expressed by the following law:


τ = A(U/U
0
)
n1
 (d/d
0
)
n2
 exp (E
A
/kT)

wherein the factor A, the exponents n
1

A
 are
material-dependent constants, and U
0
 and d
0
 are, respectively, the voltage unit and the unit
of length.
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a housing (11)
accommodates the TDR ceramic (12) which is provided with electrodes (17) and which is

embedded in glass wool (16), the electrical connection leads (14) of the ceramic material
being led outwards and at least one of the circular cross-sectional areas, each of which has

an electrode (17), being thermally influenceable. 
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the thermal
influence is obtained by a suitably arranged end plate having a connection surface (15), 
via

which end plate the preventive fuse (10) is mechanically and thermally connected to the
device to be monitored.
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the housing
(11) comprises an intrinsic heating element in the portion of the TDR ceramic (12) which

can be thermally influenced, which intrinsic heating element also has outwardly extending
connection leads (14) enabling a defined temperature setting.
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the intrinsic
heating element is constituted by a PTC element (13), which is based on doped barium

titanates and/or barium/lead titanates and/or barium/strontium titanates, for example 70%
BaTiO
3
 and 30% PbTiO
3
, and which is thermally closely coupled to one or more than one
side of the TDR ceramic (12) and which comprises electrodes (17) on its circular cross-sectional

areas.
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the thermal
contact is established by a thin Al

O

which there is attached the TDR ceramic (12) and on the other side of which there is

attached the PTC element (13) by means of a temperature-resistant adhesive (25).
A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the electrical
connection leads (14) of the TDR ceramic (12) and of the PTC element (13) are led out of

the housing (11) in an electrically separated manner and 
in that

A preventive fuse as claimed in Claim 8, 
characterized in that

temperature-resistant adhesive (25) and 
in that
 their electrodes form a common ground

housing, and
