<ABSTRACT>
In a method of processing a circuit board formed 
of an aluminum nitride sintered body, a substrate (100) 

formed of an aluminum nitride sintered body is prepared. 
A groove (101) and a hole (102) are formed in the 

substrate (100) formed of the aluminum nitride sintered 
body by directing water jet to a surface of the substrate 

(100). Alternatively, an interconnection layers (104) and 
an electric resistant body (103) connecting the 

interconnection layers (104) are formed on the surface of 
the substrate (100), and a notch portion (105) is formed 

in the electric resistant body (103) by directing the 

water jet to the surface of the electric resistant body 
(103). In this manner, processing of the substrate (100) 

and adjustment of electrical resistance value of the 
electric resistant body (103) can be carried out 

precisely.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
processing a circuit board and, more specifically, to a 
method of processing a circuit board formed of aluminum 
nitride sintered body. Recently, semiconductor devices having higher speed 
of operations and higher degree of integration have been 
developed, and the degree of integration in LSIs has been 
significantly improved. Consequently, heat radiation of 
the substrate material on which semiconductor elements are 
mounted has come to be of greater importance. Alumina (Aℓ₂O₃) has been used as a ceramics for IC 
boards. However, since the conventional alumina sintered 
body has low thermal conductivity, heat radiation is not 
sufficient. Therefore, it become more difficult to use 
alumina sintered bodies as ceramics for substrates which 
can sufficiently cope with the increase of heat emitted 
from IC chips. In view of the foregoing, substrates, heat sinks and 
packages using aluminum nitride having high thermal 
conductivity have come to attract attention as good  
 
substitute for alumina substrates. Developments have been 
made for practical applications of aluminum nitride. Aluminum nitride is a material which inherently has 
high thermal conductivity and high insulation but unlike 
beryllia porcelain which also has high thermal 
conductivity, no toxicity. Therefore, it is considered as 
a promising insulating material or packaging material for 
semiconductor devices. In the conventional method of processing circuit 
boards formed of alumina, a large thin plate is formed by 
a sheet forming method, grooves such as snap lines are 
provided by laser processing, and the thin plate is 
divided into pieces by a process like chocolate breaking 
(hereinafter referred to as a chocolate breaking process). 
Substrates formed of alumina have been processed variously 
by using laser, and the substrates have been widely used 
as insulating substrates for ICs. Similar laser processing has been proposed for 
processing substrates formed of aluminum nitride. 
However, aluminum nitride is decomposed into Aℓ and N₂ gas 
by laser irradiation. Consequently, Aℓ is deposited at 
portions processed by laser, degrading insulation of the 
aluminum nitride substrate. A conductive layer as an 
electric resistant body is formed on a circuit board 
formed of aluminum nitride. In order to adjust electric  
 
resistance value of the electric resistant body, the 
conductive layer is selectively removed by laser 
irradiation. In this case also, Aℓ is deposited at 
portions processed
