<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
producing a hydrofluorocarbon.A hydrofluorocarbon is a substitute for a
chlorofluorocarbon compound such as 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane,
and it is a compound which does
not destroy the ozone layer.The following reports have been made with respect to
methods for preparing a hydrofluorocarbon using an
iodofluorocarbon as a starting material.
(1) A method of conducting the reduction in the presence
of zinc (J. Fluorine Chem., 6,297, 1975).(2) A method for the synthesis by a reaction employing
the Grignard reagent (J. Fluorine Chem., 3,247,1973).(3) A method for the synthesis by a liquid phase
reduction by employing hydrogen and a Raney nickel
catalyst (Ger. Offen. 2,060,041, J. Fluorine Chem. Soc.,
3761,1953).(4) A method for the synthesis by a reduction employing 
sodium hypophosphite or a palladium or a platinum
catalyst (J. Fluorine Chem., 55,101, 1991).(5) A method for reacting the starting material with
alcoholic potassium hydroxide (J. Chem. Soc., 3761,
1953).(6) A method of reacting the starting material with an
alkali metal hydroxide in methanol (EP 0,449,516 A1).The method (1) has problems with respect to the
handling and disposal of zinc and a zinc slurry resulting
from the reaction.The method (2) has a possible danger such that the
Grignard reagent is ignitable by moisture or the like.
Further, it has a high possibility of danger, since a low
boiling point ether-type solvent is used. It further has
a problem with respect to disposal of the liquid waste.The method (3) has a high possibility of danger,
since the reaction is required to be conducted under high
temperature and high pressure conditions i.e. at 65°C
under from 60 to 80 atm.The method (4) has a problem that it requires an
expensive catalyst.The method (5) has problems that a high temperature
of from 100 to 130°C is required for the reaction, and
the yield is low.With the method (6) employing methanol and an alkali
metal hydroxide, it is difficult to bring the conversion
of the iodofluorocarbon as a starting material to an 
industrially satisfactory level, and it is also difficult
to obtain a hydrofluorocarbon with a high purity.Further, if an aqueous solution of an inexpensive
alkali metal hydroxide which is commonly used for an
industrial purpose, is employed as the alkali metal
hydroxide, the conversion will further deteriorate.
Furthermore, since the alkali metal hydroxide contains
water, or since water is formed by the reaction, the
water content in the reaction system tends
