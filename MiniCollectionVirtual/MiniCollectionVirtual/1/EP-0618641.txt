<ABSTRACT>
A phased array antenna system (50) for illuminating a given 
radar surveillance volume operates over a plurality of separate 

frequency bands. Said system comprises a space-fed lens (70) 
comprising first and second radiating apertures (72, 74), said 

first aperture (72) phasing a feed means (60), said second 
aperture (74) for illuminating said volume, each aperture (72, 

74) comprising a plurality of radiating elements each in turn 
coupled to a corresponding radiating element of the other 

radiating aperture (72, 74) through a phase shifter device (76, 
77, 78). Each aperture (72, 74) comprises means (100) for 

multiplexing an incoming wideband signal into separate frequency 
band signals, whereby said phase shifter devices (76, 77, 78) 

are each associated with signals of one of said frequency bands 
and are only required to perform a phase shifting function over 

the particular frequency band with which said phase shifter 
device (76, 77, 78) is associated. Further provided are space 

feed means (60) for illuminating said first aperture (72) with 
signals covering said plurality of frequency bands.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phased array antenna
system for illuminating a given radar surveillance volume, said
system operating over a plurality of separate frequency bands,
comprising:
a space-fed lens comprising a first radiation aperture for
illuminating said volume, said aperture comprising a plurality
of radiating elements coupled to phase shifter devices,said aperture comprising means for multiplexing an incoming
wideband signal into separate frequency band signals,
wherein said phase shifter devices are each associated with
signals of one of said frequency bands and are only required to
perform a phase shifting function over the particular frequency
band with which said phase shifter device is associated.Such a phased array antenna system is known from US 5,087,922. The invention generally relates to wideband radars having an
electronic beam scanning capability.In order to achieve wide instantaneous bandwidth
(signal bandwidth), conventional phased arrays use time
delay- phase shifters (time delay compensation) at each
radiating element or subarray level. For a given beam scan
angle each time delay phase shifter is adjusted so that the
radiated signals from the elements all arrive at the same
time to form a plane wavefront in the direction of the beam
scan angle. Due to the long delay lines required for large
arrays, the time delay phase shifters are bulky, lossy and
costly. Above mentioned US 5,087,922 discloses a multi-frequency
band phased array antenna using a coplanar dipole array with
multiple feed ports. This known antenna provides a four band
operation with independently steerable beams. Separate feeds
and phase shifters are provided for each band, but only a common
aperture for all bands. Each feed is provided with its own
separate bandpass filter which may act as either a short circuit
or an open circuit. Due to these bandpass filters, different
effective dipole lengths for each operating frequency band
are achieved. The dipoles and their associated feed network and
phase controls may be arranged in a feed through lens array arrangement.
However, a space-fed antenna or at least some preferred
feeding means are not disclosed.US 3,886,547 discloses a phased array antenna for transmission
of and echo reception of a plurality of different radar
signals. The antenna comprises individual radiators which are
supplied from a central feeding device via adjustable phase
changers. In one embodiment the central feeding means comprises
horn radiators which are inclined toward each other in
