<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection apparatus for a diesel engine has a fuel 
injection pump for feeding fuel under pressure and fuel 

injection nozzles provided in the engine to inject fuel fed 
from the injection pump. A pressure sensor for detecting 

fuel pressure is provided in a midway in a fuel line 
connecting the injection pump to the injection nozzles. An 

electronic control unit (ECU) computes the frequency of the 
pressure fluctuation of fuel based on a detected value from 

the pressure sensor immediately after fuel is injected from 
the injection nozzles. The ECU then computes a fuel bulk 

modulus based on the result of the computation of the 
frequency of the pressure fluctuation. Based on the computed 

bulk modulus, the ECU computes a fuel injection start and end 
time. Further, the ECU adjusts an instruction value for fuel 

injection control based on the result of the computation of 
injection start and end, and controls the injection pump 

based on the adjusted instruction value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a fuel injection apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1.Two of the main components in conventional fuel injection
systems used in diesel and other types of engines are a
fuel injection pump 151 and injection nozzles 152 as shown
in Fig. 20. Each injection nozzle 152 operates to inject
fuel, supplied under high pressure by the injection pump
151, into a combustion chamber 154 of an engine 153. The
amount of fuel injected into the combustion chamber 154 is
variously controlled by fuel injection timing according to
changing engine operating parameters. The fuel injection
apparatus used in the electronically controlled diesel
engine, for example, utilizes a fuel pump 151 activated by
a plunger 155 to compress fuel in a high pressure chamber
165 inside the pump 151. The high-pressure fuel is then
fed to the injection nozzle 152 from which it is injected
into the combustion chamber 154.A computer 157 or other type of electronic device typically
controls the injection pump 151. The computer 157 or
electronic device first computes a desired or target value
of fuel to be injected in the engine 153 based on detected
engine operating conditions. Then, based on the computed
target value, the computer 157 controls an electromagnetic
coil 158 provided in the injection pump 151 to open a spill
valve 159 (or a spill ring in other pump types). Next, the
high pressure chamber 156 opens to a fuel chamber 160 
allowing fuel to spill into the fuel chamber 160 from the
high pressure chamber 156. The amount of fuel supplied
during any single injection operation depends directly on
the time which the injector pump 151 begins and ends its
supply of pressurized fuel to the injection nozzle 152 and
combustion chamber 154.The computer 157 accomplishes this by computing a target
value for injection timing in accordance with various
engine operating conditions. The computed target value is
then used by the computer 157 to control a timer device 161
provided in the injection pump 151, which in turn, controls
the movement of the plunger 155. In this way, the computer
157 controls the action of the plunger 155 to begin the
supply of pressurized fuel from the injection pump 151 to
the injection nozzle 152, and ultimately, to the combustion
chamber 154.Even with such electronically precise control over the
timing and amount of fuel injection, time dependent
mechanical changes as well as changes in fuel
characteristics tend to compromise the performance of fuel
injection control. Instances of this
