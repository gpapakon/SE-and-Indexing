<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to a foldable package (100, 200) for surgical 
products, composed of a plurality of foldable panels (101-106) and particularly 

suitable for holding a surgical suture (115) wound in a non-crossed over 
manner on pins (111) that penetrate orifices (110; 201, 202) in a first retaining 

panel (101) and preferably arranged along semi-circular paths. In this manner, 
even a suture (115) having a large memory may be held for long periods of 

time in the package of this invention without taking up an accentuatedly wavy 
shape after withdrawal from the package (100, 200). 
Further according to the present invention, the package includes a 
tongue-slot type locking means (130, 131) for maintaining the package (100, 

200) folded and closed, the respective slot (131)being arranged transversally 
half way along the first retaining panel (101).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a foldable package or retainer for surgical 
products, and more specifically to a package composed of a plurality of 
foldable panels particularly suitable for retaining a sterilized surgical suture 
made of polymeric material having elastic memory, one or more needles being 
fixed at its ends. Various types of surgical suture packages are already known in the art, 
which vary in accordance with the nature of the suture and its end use. In 
general, the principal function of such packages is to protect the suture and the 
respective needle(s) during transport, handling and storage prior to their 
reaching the end user. Apart from this, the most improved packages known in 
the art have reduced production costs and their structural concept facilitates 
opening which permits the suture-needle combination to be easily reached and 
removed from the package. The prior art considered most pertinent to the invention is that disclosed 
in Brazilian Patent PI 8201615 in the name of Johnson & Johnson, the contents 
of which are incorporated herein by way of reference. That patent refers to a foldable package or retainer for a surgical suture 
with a needle that includes first and second foldably connected surgical 
product retaining panels and first and second locking panels that are also 
foldable connected to each other, the first locking panel being foldably 
connected to the first retaining panel. All such panels are rectangular, normally 
made of paper card and connected to each other along their longitudinal longer 
edges, the final configuration of the retainer or package being obtained when 
the retaining panels are folded over each other with the suture therebetween, 
and the locking panels are successively folded so as completely surround the 
retaining panels. Preferably, the prior art package comprises two tongue-slot type locking 
devices: a first one being capable of maintaining the retaining panels folded 
over each other with a view to immobilizing the suture, the tongue thereof 
being arranged on the longitudinal free edge of the second retaining panel and 
the slot of which is positioned on the first retaining panel, parallel and adjacent 
to the edge joining the latter panel to the first locking panel. The second locking means permits fixing of the second locking panel 
over the rear face of the first retaining panel, so as to maintain the package 
closed, and comprises a tongue arranged at the longitudinal free edge of the  
 
second locking panel, which
