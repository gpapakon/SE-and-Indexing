<ABSTRACT>
A feed shaft (7) is connected in front of a roller grate for the incineration, in particular, of rubbish. The roller grate has several cylindrical grate rollers (1) arranged along an inclined plane. The feed shaft (7) is intended for loading the roller grate and is provided at its bottom end with a feed opening (13) and a feed table (8) defining the feed opening (13) from below. A thrust piston (10) is guided back and forth in a sliding manner over the feed table (8). The grate roller (1) adjacent to the feed shaft (7) is arranged at a lateral distance from the discharge edge (11) of the feed table (8). The top vertex (14) of this grate roller (1) lies in the plane of the feed table (8) or at most up to half the radius of the grate roller (1) above or below this plane, so that a sump is formed between the discharge edge (11) and the said grate roller (1).

Device for the charging of fuel, in particular of refuse, onto a roller 
grate with several cylindrical grate rollers (1) arranged along an 

inclined plane, wherein a charging shaft (7), which is provided at its 
lower end with a charging opening (13) and with a charging table (8), 

which bounds the charging opening (13) and displays a discharge edge 
(11) and across which a pusher piston (10) is guided to slide to and 

fro, is connected upstream of the roller grate, wherein a base (12), 
which is stepped or points obliquely downwards, is disposed between the 

discharge edge (11) and the first grate roller and wherein the cross-section 
of the charging opening (13) is smaller than the cross-section 

of the charging shaft (7), characterised thereby, that the grate roller 
(1) neighbouring the charging shaft (7) is arranged at a lateral 

spacing from the discharge edge (11) of the charging table (8) and that 
the upper crest point (14) of this grate roller (1) lies either in the 

plane of the charging table (8) or above or below this plane by at most 

half the radius of the grate roller (1), whereby a sump (15) of the 
fuel is formed between the discharge edge (11) and the first grate 

roller.
