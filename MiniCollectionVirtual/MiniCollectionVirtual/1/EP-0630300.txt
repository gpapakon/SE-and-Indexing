<ABSTRACT>
In a method of making a head on an elongate blank (26) a blank (26) is moved into a die (16) having a bottom stop (28) such that part of the blank (26) extends outside the die (16) end opposite the bottom stop (28), following which the protruding part of the blank (26) is formed by a pre-upsetter (25) having a pre-upsetting bushing positioned in extension of the die (16) and a punch (27) slidably movable in said pre-upsetting bushing, said pre-upsetter (25) and said die (16) being moved away from each other during part of the forming procedure. The movement of both the punch (27) and the pre-upsetter (25) with respect to the die (16) is positively controlled so that the pre-upsetter (25) and the die (16) are moved away from each other at the end of the forming procedure, while the punch (27) continues to press in a direction toward the die (16). An apparatus for making a head on an elongate blank (26) comprises means for positively controlling the movement of both the punch (27) and the pre-upsetter (25) with respect to the die (16), so that the pre-upsetter (25) is moved away from the die (16) at the end of the forming procedure, while the punch (27) continues to press in a direction toward the die (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and an apparatus for making 
a head on an elongate blank, wherein a blank is moved 
into a die having a bottom stop such that part of the 
blank extends outside the die end opposite the bottom 
stop. The protruding part of the blank is then formed by a 
pre-upsetter which has a pre-upsetting bushing positioned 
in extension of the die, and a punch capable of being displaced 
in the pre-upsetting bushing, said pre-upsetter and 
said die being able to move relative to each other during part of 
the forming procedure. For pre-upsetting of a head on an elongate blank it is 
known to place a wire blank in a die having a bottom stop; 
e.g. in the form of an ejector pin, following which the 
blank is formed by means of a punch in a pre-upsetter. To obtain optimum quality of the head and to avoid deflection 
of the blank during the upsetting process, it is of 
decisive importance that the free length of the wire blank 
between the die and the pre-upsetter is sufficiently 
small. Since, however, a large volume in the head is frequently 
desired, this distance is usually increased to the 
maximum length. It is frequently desired at the same time 
that pre-upsetting proceeds to a great diameter, which 
increases the load on the pre-upsetter pin. These circumstances 
limit the maximum upsetting ratio that can be 
achieved, said upsetting ratio being the length of the 
wire outside the retention of the die divided by the wire 
diameter. It is desirable to achieve an upsetting ratio as 
great as possible.  
 It is known to improve the upsetting ratio by allowing the 
pre-upsetter to move away from the die during the process. 
This results in the short distance at the start of the 
process, while the length is increased with a simultaneous 
corresponding increase of the diameter during the process, 
whereby the blank remains stable. This takes place in the 
prior art by spring loading the pre-upsetter so that it is 
pressed away from the die as the head is formed. This 
prior art is mentioned e.g. by Billigmann/Feldmann: 
"Stauchen und Pressen", 1973. This is also disclosed in US-A-3 127 626 
and US-A-3 253 287. However, this process has 
the drawback that it is difficult to optimize the process, 
because the movement of the pre-upsetter away from the die 
is only controlled by a spring, and this restricts the 
size of upsetting ratios that can be achieved. In this prior art, the punch follows the forced movement 
of the forming mechanism from e.g. a crank mechanism. The object of the
