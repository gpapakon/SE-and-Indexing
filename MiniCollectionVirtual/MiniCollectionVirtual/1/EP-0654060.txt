<ABSTRACT>
Solutions of polymers of aspartic acid or its amine copolymers prepared by thermal condensation are reacted with a decolorizing agent selected from the group consisting of hypochlorite, chlorine, chlorine dioxide, hydrogen peroxide, a peroxycarboxylate or ozone, sufficient in strength to effect the desired decolorization.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for the reduction of color obtained in the thermal
polymerization of aspartic acid or the ammonium salts of maleic acid or fumaric acid to produce
polysuccinimide which is then hydrolyzed to obtain polyaspartic acid or of copolymers of aspartic acid
obtained by the thermal polymerization of these materials with polyamines.Sodium polyaspartate and copolymers of polyaspartate find application as adjuvants in
cosmetics and in hair-treatment compositions such as shampoos, hair wave setting lotion or hair
brushing lotion. Preparation of such polymers, however, is associated with the generation of highly
colored products which interfere with cosmetic and hair treatment applications.Previous methods for the reduction of color in the thermal polymerization to obtain less colored
polyaspartic acid from its precursor compounds have centered on the reaction conditions and catalysts
used in the thermal polymerization.In U.S. Patent 4,353,797, a superior method of forming reduced color polysuccinimide is
disclosed in which the polymerization is carried out in the presence of a solvent of high boiling point in
conjunction with a solid acid catalyst, yielding a polysuccinimide which is only slightly colored. Also
disclosed is the use of 85% ortho-phosphoric acid as a catalyst for the production of a white
polysuccinimide; however, the use of this reagent is said to require unusual apparatus, delicate
separation and large volumes of solvent. Polysuccinimide may be converted to polyaspartic acid by
treatment with hydroxide.U.S. Patent 5,057,597 discloses the thermal condensation of aspartic acid in a nitrogen
atmosphere to form polysuccinimide which may then be hydrolyzed to give polyaspartic acid. No
decolorization is disclosed.These disclosures do not meet the requirement of an inexpensive, effective environmentally
benign process for the decolorization of polyaspartate and its amine copolymers.A method for decolorizing polyaspartic acid prepared by thermal condensation is disclosed
wherein a solution of polyaspartic acid is reacted with a decolorizing agent selected from the group
consisting of hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, a peroxydicarbonate or chlorine
sufficient in strength to effect the desired decolorization.One objective of this invention is to provide processes for decolorization of polyaspartate and
its amine copolymers.Another objective is to provide processes which produce polyaspartate and its amine
copolymers having reduced color which is
