<ABSTRACT>
A construction for milking animals comprises one or 
more milking units (1) connected to a ring line (2) in which 

a milk tank (3) is incorporated. Near the connection of the 
discharge outlet of the milk tank (3) to the ring line (2), a 

pump (12) is incorporated in the ring line (2) for circulating 
milk or rinsing fluid flowing from the milk tank 

(3). Taken in the direction of flow, there is incorporated in 
the ring line (2) behind the pump (12), relatively close to 

the pump (12), a three-way valve (15) to which is connected a 
line (22) which is fed back to the milk tank (3). At the end 

of this line (22) there is present a spray nozzle (21), 
whilst via this line (22) rinsing fluid flowing from the milk 

tank (3) can be directly circulated with the aid of the pump 
(12) without passing through the entire ring line (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction for
milking animals, comprising one or more milking units
connected to a ring line in which a milk tank
with spraying means for cleaning the interior side is
incorporated, whilst, near the connection of the discharge
outlet of the milk tank to the ring line, a pump is
incorporated in the ring line for circulating milk or rinsing
fluid, while, taken in the direction of flow, there is
provided in the ring line behind the pump, a three-way valve.Such a construction is known from EP-A-0 385 539.In this known construction rinsing fluid can be
introduced into the milk tank via a separate rinsing line in
which is incorporated a valve and which at its end is
provided with a spray nozzle. The rinsing fluid is circulated
by the pump in the circular line at a relatively high speed.
The above described construction has the disadvantage that in
order to clean the interior of the milk tank the whole ring
line must be filled with rinsing fluid and the rinsing fluid
is circulated through the whole ring line before it can be
used to clean the interior of the milk tank. Consequently a
thoroughly cleaning of the milk tank takes a relative long
time while much rinsing liquid is used. Furthermore energy is
wasted by circulating the cleaning liquid through the whole
ring line, as the ring line itself is much easier to clean
than the milk. For cleaning the ring line it is enough to
circulate the rinsing liquid a few times through the ring
line, while for cleaning the milk tank it is necessary that
the rinsing liquid must be circulated for a much longer time
in order to clean the interior thoroughly.The invention has for its object to implement the
construction in such a manner that the above-described
disadvantages do not occur or are at least minimized.
According to the invention, the above-described construction
for milking animals is therefore characterized in that a 
rinsing fluid line is connected to the three-way valve at the
end of which rinsing fluid line spraying means are provided.
In this
construction the ring line may have a length exceeding the
length of the rinsing fluid line. The advantage of this
construction is that for the purpose of cleaning the milk
tank, a rinsing fluid ring line of a reduced length is
sufficient, which will result in less rinsing liquid, a
better cleaning system and/or a lower pump power.It makes it furthermore possible to clean the milk
tank separately from the ring line.In an advantageous embodiment in accordance with
the invention, a

<CLAIMS>
A construction for milking animals, comprising one
or more milking units (1) connected to a ring line (2) in

which a milk tank (3) with spraying means for cleaning the interior
side of the milk tank (3) is incorporated, whilst, near the

connection of the discharge outlet of the milk tank (3) to
the ring line (2), a pump (12) is incorporated in the ring

line (2) for circulating milk or rinsing fluid, while, taken
in the direction of flow, there is provided in the ring line

(2) behind the pump (12), a three-way valve (15),
characterized in that a rinsing fluid line (22) is connected

to the three-way valve (15), at the end of which rinsing
fluid line (22) the spraying means (21) are provided. 
A construction as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the ring line (2) has a length exceeding the length

of the rinsing fluid line (22).
A construction as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a milking unit (1) is connected, taken in the

direction of flow, to the ring line (2) in a point behind the
three-way valve (15).
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that a non-return valve (13) is disposed

between the pump (12) and the three-way valve (15).
A construction as claimed in claim 4, characterized
in that between the non-return valve (13) and the three-way

valve (15) there is disposed in the ring line (2) an air
inlet valve (14) for the purpose of removing milk or rinsing

fluid from the ring line (2) or from the line (22) connected
to the spray nozzle (21).
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the three-way valve

(15) is controlled by a computer (24).
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a milking unit (1)

includes a robot for automatically connecting the teat cups
(4) to the teats of an animal to be milked.
A construction as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that a milking unit (1)

operates automatically and co-operates with an animal identification 
system, whilst the computer (24) of the automatic

milking unit (1) and/or of the animal identification system
supplies signals for controlling the milking and cleaning

procedures, more specifically for controlling the said pump
(12), three-way valve (15) and air inlet valve (14) incorporated

in the ring line.
