<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide color
photographic light sensitive material containing a magenta
coupler and, particularly, to a silver halide color
photographic light sensitive material in which color
reproducibility and color producibility can be excellent and a
dye image stable against heat and light can be obtained when
using a novel pyrazoloazole type magenta coupler in the material.Couplers suitable for silver halide
color photographic light sensitive materials have included
for example, yellow couplers
each comprising an open-chained ketomethylene type compound,
magenta couplers each comprising a pyrazolone or
pyrazoloazole type compound and cyan couplers each
comprising a phenol or naphthol type compound. Among them, a 
5-pyrazolone compound has often been used as a magenta
coupler.Known pyrazolone magenta couplers are described in,
for example, US Patent Nos. 2,600,788 and 3,519,429 and
Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection
(hereinafter referred to as JP OPI Publication) Nos. 49-111631(9174)
and 57-35858(1982). However, dyes made of the
pyrazolone magenta couplers have produced an undesirable
side-absorption, and improvements have been called for, as
described in "The Theory of the Photographic Process", the
4th Ed., Macmillan Publishing Col, 1977, pp.356-358; "Fine
Chemical", Vol.14, No. 8, CMC Press, pp.38-41; and the
Lecture Transcription published at the 1985 Annual
convention of the Society of Photographic Science of Japan,
pp.108-110.As described in the documents referred to above, dyes
made of the pyrazoloazole type magenta couplers do not
produce any side-absorption. The documents referred to
above, US Patent Nos. 3,725,067, 3,758,309 and 3,810,761
and so forth describe that the couplers of this type are
excellent.However, the light-fastness of azomethine dyes made
of the couplers is so seriously low that the
characteristics of colour photographic light sensitive
materials, particularly those of print type colour
photographic light sensitive materials are seriously
impaired. JP OPI 5-241283 and JP OPI 5-241292 disclose magenta
couplers of the following formula:

wherein A is a pyrazolotriazole residue, L is a divalent
connecting group, Y represents a non-metallic atomic group
necessary to form a 5- or 6- membered heterocyclic ring
together with the nitrogen atom, R1 is a substituent and n
is from 0 to 4.Much study and research has been carried out in an
attempt to improve light-fastness. For example, JP OPI
Publication Nos. 59-125732(1984), 
61-282845(1986),
