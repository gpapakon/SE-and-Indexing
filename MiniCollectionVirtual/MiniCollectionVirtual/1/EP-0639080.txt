<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to predominantly
hydrophobic non-azo 1,8-naphthalimide dyes, their
compositions, their preparations, and their uses. More
specifically, the present invention relates to
predominantly hydrophobic monomeric and dimeric non-azo
N-substituted-1,8-naphthalimide dyes, their
compositions, their preparations, and their uses.Classical photodynamic therapy, which
superficially resembles the new invention described
herein is a technique by which membrane alterations can
be made in a living cell and virus envelope by
irradiation of a dye incorporated into the membrane.
See, U.S. Patent Numbers 4,613,322; 4,684,521;
4,649,151; and 4,878,891. This classical technique has
been proven to rely on the triplet sensitization of
oxygen to form singlet oxygen within the membrane. The
hydroperoxides produced in the initial reaction between
singlet oxygen and the unsaturated lipids of the
membrane decompose to produce the observed membrane
alterations, leading to cell death or viral
inactivation. Thus, the efficiency of the photodynamic
effect is directly related to the efficiency of the
classical dyes as a triplet sensitizer. Nearly all
dyes currently used for the classical photodynamic
therapy give good triplet yields upon irradiation.
While selective alteration of either plasma or
mitochondrial membranes can be achieved by using a dye
with appropriate localization characteristics, the 
actual chemistry which produces the modification cannot
be well controlled, and selective damage to the
membrane cannot be affected.There is currently no method available for
selectively altering a membrane based upon selecting
for one membrane over another on the basis of any
simple membrane property, such as lipid composition,
membrane fluidity, surface proteins, integral proteins,
or other similar features. Moreover, all effective
photochemical inactivators published to date rely on
the production of singlet oxygen and the uncontrolled
free-radical chemistry of the hydroperoxides which it
produces to achieve the cell kill or viral
inactivation.According to the present invention, new non-azo
1,8-naphthalimide dyes or compounds according to Claim 1 or claim 2 are provided.
These dyes can be "monomeric" or "dimeric." Further,
their different uses are given. These new non-azo 1,8-naphthalimide
dyes are predominantly hydrophobic and,
and after being activated by a sufficient amount of
activating agent in an environment independent of the
presence or absence or oxygen, give activated
derivatives or species. More
