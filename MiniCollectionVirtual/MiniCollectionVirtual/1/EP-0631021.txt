<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a device for reducing the volume of water 
flushed from a water closet (10). A rectilinear container (32) has 

front, rear, side and bottom walls (34,36,38,40). An elongated 
suspension member (42) has a hook (44) at an upper end (47) thereof for 

engaging the rim (20) of the water closet (10) and at its lower end (50) 
it can engage bearing means on one of the rear or side walls (36,38) of 

the container (32) to suspend the container (32) within the water closet 
(10). The volume of the container (10) can be adjusted since one of the 

front or side walls (34,38) has a lower fixed portion (64) and an upper 
sliding portion (66), the sliding portion (66) being vertically slidable 

relative to the fixed portion (64). The normal flush volume of the water 
closet (10) is reduced by the volume of the container (32), thereby 

saving water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device which will reduce the effective 
volume of a water closet, thereby reducing the volume of water used with each flush. The standard water closet or toilet tank normally holds a volume of about 
45 litres of water, most of the water being used with each flush of the toilet. With the 
present need to conserve water, and also to reduce the cost of water used, there is a 
need to reduce the volume of water used per flush. The need is particularly great in 
arid areas of the country and also in institutional types of buildings such as hospitals 
or hotels. There have been many attempts at reducing the volume of water used per 
flush. Many people merely insert solid items such as a brick into the water closet so 
as to displace a portion of the available volume. While this will work there is always 
the possibility of chemicals leaching from the brick and contaminating the water or 
staining the interior of the water closet. Other people have placed plastic pails or tubs 
in the water closet so that they will fill with water but will not permit the contained 
water to leave, thereby reducing the volume flushed. These will work but they tend 
to move around within the water closet and they can interfere with the valve 
mechanism of the water closet. Other people have devised weirs which fit within the 
water closet and hold back a certain volume of water, preventing it from leaving with 
the rest of the flush water. The weirs are somewhat expensive to produce and require  
 
a degree of manual dexterity to properly position within the water closet. There is 
thus a need for a simple, inexpensive device that will reduce the flush volume, is easy 
to install, and will have no deleterious effect on the water or the water closet itself. The present invention provides a tub or open-topped container that can be 
inserted into a water closet and held there by a unique suspension system that can be 
used with either standard or insulated water closets. The container can be 
inexpensively moulded from recycled plastics and can be provided in different sizes 
if desired. Furthermore it can be provided with a sliding wall that can be adjusted to 
different heights depending on the volume of water to be held back with each flush. Broadly speaking the present invention provides a device for reducing the 
volume of water flushed from a water closet comprising: rectilinear container means 
having surrounding side and bottom walls; at least one elongated suspension member,

<CLAIMS>
A device for reducing the volume of water flushed from a water 
closet comprising: rectilinear container means having surrounding side and bottom 

walls; at least one elongated suspension member, having a hook section at an upper 
end thereof and means on the lower end slidably engageable with bearing means on 

said side wall; and means for adjusting the volume of said container, said adjusting 
means comprising said side wall being divided into fixed and sliding portions, the 

sliding portion being vertically slidable relative to the fixed portion. 
The device of claim 1 wherein said means on the lower end of said 
suspension means includes a section offset inwardly from the upper section of said 

suspension member, and said hearing means includes a pair of inwardly adjacent 
vertically extending slots on an inner surface of said side wall, said lower offset 

section being engageable with a selected one of said slots. 
The device of claim 1 wherein said means on the lower end of said 
suspension member includes a vertically elongated slot in said lower end, and said 

bearing means includes a vertically elongated T-shaped tab on said side wall, said slot 
being engageable with said tab. 
The device of claim 3 wherein said hook section includes a short 
hook on one side of said suspension member and a longer hook on the other side of 

said suspension member. 
The device of claim 2 wherein said container includes a plurality of 
side wall sections, one of said sections including said fixed and sliding wall portions, 

said sliding wall portion being guided in a pair of opposed slots and being located in 
abutting sealing relationship with said fixed wall portion. 
The device of claim 4 wherein said container includes a plurality of 
side wall sections, one of said sections including said fixed and sliding wall 

portions,said sliding wall portion is guided in a pair of opposed slots and is located in 
abutting sealing relationship with said fixed wall portion. 
The device of claim 1 wherein said container is moulded from 
recycled plastics material. 
The device of claim 1 wherein said fixed wall portion is defined by 
an upper generally cylindrical sleeve section carrying said bearing means, and said 

slidable wall portion is defined by a lower cup-like section, including said bottom wall 
and a cylindrical side wall, sealably and slidably telescopically movable with respect 

to said sleeve section. 
The device of claim 8 wherein said cup-like section is slidable within 
said sleeve section, said sleeve section having an inwardly directed flange at the lower 

end thereof and said cup-like section having an outwardly directed rim at the upper 
edge thereof. 
The device of claim 9 wherein said means on the lower end of said 
suspension member includes a vertically clongated slot in said lower end, and said 

bearing means includes a vertically elongated T-shaped tab on said sleeve member, 
said slot being engageable with said tab. 
The device of claim 10 wherein said hook section includes a short 
hook on one side of said suspension member and a longer hook on the other side of 

said suspension member.
