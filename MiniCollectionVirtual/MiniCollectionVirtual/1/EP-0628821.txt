<ABSTRACT>
The present invention involves the use of certain 
indole sulfonates in a test control method for the 

Ehrlich reagent used in diagnostic tests for 
urobilinogen. The indole sulfonates exhibit unique 

solubility characteristics which facilitate their 
application to dry carrier matrixes with subsequent 

rehydration during their use in the test control 
method.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various disease conditions such as hemolytic and 
hepatic diseases, biliary obstruction and other bile 
duct dysfunctions are known to cause abnormally high 
levels of urobilinogen in urine. The standard method for detecting urobilinogen in 
urine employs the Ehrlich reaction which utilizes an 
aqueous solution of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde or 
p-diethylaminobenzaldehyde and hydrochloric acid, often 
referred to as Ehrlich's reagent. In the presence of 
urobilinogen, there is produced a complex with the 
Ehrlich reagent which exhibits absorption in the 
visible spectrum. The color produced can be one of 
various shades of reddish-brown, depending on the 
presence of interfering substances in the urine sample 
such as p-aminosalicylic acid, porphobilinogen and 
urea. Currently available dip and read reagent strips 
can incorporate Ehrlich's reagent, i.e. p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde 
and hydrochloric acid. Such strips are 
dipped into urine whereupon the color developed is  
 
compared with a standard color chart prepared for use 
in conjunction with the reagent strips to determine the 
presence of and approximate concentration of urobilinogen. It is customary to use control solutions which are 
capable of producing the same color reaction as that 
produced by the presence of urobilinogen to check the 
instrument used to read the test strip, or, if the test 
involves human visual observation, in checking the 
skill of the technician. Such controls are also useful 
for educational purposes such as instructing technicians 
in how best to carry out urobilinogen tests. In Analytical Biochemistry, 8, 75-81 (1964) there 
is described the ability of indole and tryptophan to 
form colored products by reacting with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. 
The indoles disclosed in this reference 
have been used as urobilinogen control reagents since 
they react with Ehrlich's reagent to produce reddish-brown 
colors which closely resemble colors formed by 
the reaction of urobilinogen in urine and Ehrlich's 
reagent. Indoles having improved water solubility 
would be desirable since a more soluble indole enables 
the preparation of a more concentrated impregnation 
solution enabling the incorporation of a sufficient 
amount of the indole into an absorbant reagent strip. 
Furthermore, a more soluble indole facilitates its 
reconstitution from the reagent strip into the test 
solution at a suitable concentration. United States patent 4,405,718 discloses the use 
of indoles characterized by the formula:  where R₁ and R₂ are H
