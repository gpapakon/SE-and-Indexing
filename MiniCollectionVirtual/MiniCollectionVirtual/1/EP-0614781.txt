<ABSTRACT>
The adjustable and reclinable seat (10) comprises a seat (11) proper, a backrest (12) which can be folded down onto the seat (11) proper, a slide rail (31), an articulation (32), a bolt for locking the slide rail (31), a latching mechanism (50) for anchoring a seat-belt buckle, a control (60) for deactivating the bolt and/or latching mechanism, preferably a security mechanism (70) preventing reclining if the seat does not occupy a unique predetermined position and a safety lock which temporarily substitutes for the bolt in order to immobilise the slide rail and lock the seat in this unique position during reclining. Application to a rear seat of a land-going motor vehicle.

<CLAIMS>
Seat (10) of the adjustable and tiltable type, intended 
to be mounted on the floor (20) of a terrestrial 

automobile, comprising 

a seat portion (11) which is adjustable in a 
translational direction in a direction parallel to the 

longitudinal axis (X) of the vehicle, with a travel 
limited by two extreme positions, and rotationally 

tiltable in a direction (Y) orthogonal to said 
longitudinal axis (X), 
a back portion (12) supported by the seat portion 
(11) and hinged to fold down rotationally on to the latter 

in a direction orthogonal to said longitudinal axis (X), 
at least one assembly (30) with, on the one hand, a 
slide (31) enabling said translational movement and made 

up of a mobile member (311) integral with the seat portion 
(11) and of a semi-fixed member (312) co-operating with 

the mobile member (311), and intended to be connected to 
the floor (20) and with, on the other hand, a joint (32) 

enabling this tilting movement and connecting said semi-fixed 
member (312) to the floor (20), 
a bolt (40) for keeping the members (311, 312) of the 
slide (31) immobile relative to one another under normal 

conditions, under the action of a resilient bias, 
a lock (50) for preventing this tilting movement 
under normal conditions, and being made up of a keeper 

(51) integral with the floor (20) and of a bolt (52)  
 

articulated to co-operate with said keeper (51), in order 
to be automatically fixed in that position under the 

effect of a resilient bias, and which serves to anchor at 
least one safety-belt buckle, mooring it to the floor 

(20), 
a control means (60) for acting on the said bolt (40) 
and lock (50) against their respective resilient bias, 

enabling the translational and tilting movements to be 
carried out at will, and 
a safety device (80) temporarily supplementing the 
bolt (40) for which it forms a temporary substitute, said 

safety device (80) comprising on the one hand a body (81) 
supported by the seat portion (11), defining a housing 

(810) for a pincer (811) and for a catch (812) movable 
between a first operative position in which it immobilises 

the slide (31) and, when the seat (10) occupies one of the 
extreme positions of its translational movement, securing 

said slide (31) in a second, inoperative position in which 
it leaves the slide (31) free, when the seat (10) does not 

occupy this extreme translational position, and on the 
other hand by a yoke (82) supported by the floor (20), 

intended to co-operate with said pincer (811) and said 
catch (812). 
Seat according to claim 1, in which the catch (812) is 
a lever tiltably mounted on a pin (813) and subjected to  

 
the force of a spring (814) in order normally to occupy 

its inoperative position. 
Seat according to claim 1 or 2, in which the catch 
(812) comprises a feeler (8121) intended to co-operate 

with the yoke (82) and a stop (8122) intended to co-operate 
with a stopper (83) integral with the seat (11). 
Seat according to claim 3, in which the stopper (83) is 
mounted directly or indirectly on the seat (11). 
Seat according to claim 4, in which the stopper (83) is 
mounted on the slide (31). 
Seat according to claim 4 or 5, in which the stopper 
(83) is integral with the mobile member (311) of the slide 

(31). 
Seat according to any one of claims 1 to 6, in which 
the body (81) is equipped with a securing tab (801) 

intended to co-operate with the semi-fixed member (312) of 
the slide (31). 
Seat according to any one of claims 1 to 7, in which 
the pincer (811) has two resilient lyre-shaped branches 

(8110) intended to bridge over the yoke (82) when the seat  
 

occupies a position in which the safety device (80) leaves 
the slide (31) free. 
Seat according to any one of claims 1 to 8, comprising 
a security element (70) made up of two co-operating 

portions (71,72) with connecting profiles, one (71) mobile 
and integral with the seat (11) and the other (72) fixed 

and integral with the floor (20), and set up to permit 
either tilting of the seat (10) in one direction after 

separation of the bolt (52) from the keeper (51), or 
fixing of the bolt (52) to the keeper (51) after tilting 

of the seat (10) in the opposite direction, only when the 
seat (10) is at this end of its translational travel. 
Seat according to claim 9, in which the security 
element (70) comprises a mobile portion (71) with a 'J' 

profile, and a fixed portion (72) with an inverted 'J' 
profile. 
Seat according to claim 10, in which the mobile 
portion (71) is integral with the mobile member (311) of 

the slide (31), and the fixed portion (72) is integral 
with the floor (20). 
Seat according to claim 10 or 11, in which the yoke 
(82) is mounted on a plate (820) comprising the fixed 

portion (72).  
 
Seat according to any one of claims 1 to 12, in which 
the end of the translational travel is that situated 

furthest forward. 
Application of a seat according to any one of claims 1 
to 13 for a rear single- or multiple-place seat.
