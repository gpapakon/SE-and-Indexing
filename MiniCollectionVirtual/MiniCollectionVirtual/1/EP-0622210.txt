<ABSTRACT>
An improved ink jet print head includes tapered 
manifolds (222), ports (234), and inlet channels (214) all 

leading elevationally upward to sweep bubbles from the 
head, aided by their buoyancy. The ports opening to the 

inlet channels are distributed at staggered locations 
throughout the manifolds with at least some of the ports 

located adjacent to the elevationally highest edge of each 
manifold. This aspect of the invention reduces bubble 

entrapment and improves jetting performance by reducing 
acoustic cross-talk among ink pressure chambers (204) of 

the head. Moreover, tapering the ink supply manifolds and 
other features causes more uniform ink flow rates and 

reduces flow rate stagnation regions within the head. 
Purging cycles therefore require smaller volumes of ink 

than with prior designs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
drop-on-demand ink jet print head and in particular to a
compact ink jet print head incorporating multiple arrays
of ink jets, each array receiving ink from an ink supply
manifold having a tapered cross-sectional area.There have been known apparatus and methods for
implementing multiple-orifice drop-on-demand ink jet print
heads. In general, each channel of a multiple-orifice
drop-on-demand ink jet operates by displacement of ink in
an ink pressure chamber and subsequent emission of ink
droplets from the ink pressure chamber through a nozzle.
Ink is supplied from a common ink supply manifold through
an ink inlet to the ink pressure chamber. A driver mechanism
is used to displace the ink in the ink pressure chamber.
The driver mechanism typically includes a transducer
(e.g., a piezoceramic material) bonded to a thin diaphragm.
When a voltage is applied to a transducer, the
transducer displaces ink in the ink pressure chamber,
causing ink flow through the inlet from the ink manifold
to the ink pressure chamber and through an outlet and passageway
to a nozzle. It is desirable to employ a geometry
that permits multiple nozzles to be positioned in a densely
packed array. The arrangement of the manifolds, inlets,
and chambers and the coupling of the chambers to 
associated nozzles are not straightforward tasks, especially
when compact ink jet array print heads are sought.
Incorrect design choices, even in minor features, can
cause nonuniform jetting performance.Uniform jetting performance is generally accomplished
by making the various features of each array channel
in the ink jet print head substantially identical.
Uniform jetting also depends on each channel being clear
of air and internally generated gas bubbles which can form
in the print head and interfere with jetting performance
by blocking ink flow within the head. Therefore, the various
features of the multiple-orifice print head must also
be designed for effective purging.An exemplary prior art ink jet print head construction
is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,680,595 of Cruz-Uribe,
et al. Figs. 1 and 4 of Cruz-Uribe et al. show two
parallel rows of generally rectangular ink pressure chambers
positioned with their centers aligned. The ink jet
nozzles are coupled to different respective ink pressure
chambers. The central axis of each nozzle extends normal
to the plane containing the ink pressure chambers and
intersects an extension portion of the ink pressure chamber.
