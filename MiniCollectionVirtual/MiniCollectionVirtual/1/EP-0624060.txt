<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to coated
sheet materials for use in making containers,
wrappers and receptacles for food and other
materials, including containers that are ovenable.
This invention also relates to containers, food
wrappers, receptacles and the like formed from
such coated sheet materials. The invention also
relates to methods for making same.One of the most common types of containers
used for heating food in an oven is the aluminum
pan, or other such containers made of a thin sheet
of aluminum or aluminum foil. Such aluminum
containers may be preformed into a specific shape,
thus avoiding the labor required for assembly of
the shaped article, and can be easily stacked,
thus allowing for easy storage and dispensing
therefrom for use. Furthermore, such aluminum
containers are resistant to penetration by grease
or oil, or by water moisture, and permit good
browning of baked goods that are baked therein.
An example of these sorts of aluminum containers
is disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,496,896
to Smith.Though strong and readily preformable,
aluminum containers generally cannot be used in
microwave cooking. Consequently, efforts have
been made to develop plastic containers and
plastic-coated paper structures that can withstand
heating in either conventional or microwave ovens
-- i.e., that are "dual-ovenable." To be
"ovenable" for purposes of a conventional oven, a 
structure should be able to withstand temperatures
of up to at least 148,9°C (300°F) and, preferably, about
204,4°C (400°F) or so; to be "ovenable" for purposes of a
microwave oven, the structure should be strong at
boiling water temperatures and should not reflect
microwaves and thereby cause arcing or damage the
oven's microwave generation. Furthermore,
concurrent with such efforts directed at
developing dual-ovenable containers, there has
been interest in achieving this result without
increasing the cost of the container, or
preferably by decreasing such costs.One development in this area has been the
use of extruded films of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), or polybutylene terephthalate
(PBT), adhered to a paper material for
oven-heatable trays. For example, United States
Patent No. 4,900,594 to Quick et al. discloses an
ovenable tray made with a bi-axially oriented film
of PET, such as MYLAR™. The PET film is adhered
to a paperboard substrate by means of a
cross-linkable adhesive. A shaped tray is formed
from the PET-paperboard laminate by
pressure-forming procedures such as that described
in United States Patent
