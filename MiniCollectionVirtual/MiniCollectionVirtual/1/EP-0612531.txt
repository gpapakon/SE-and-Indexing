<ABSTRACT>
Glicentin as active ingredients may be used for 
the treatment of digestive tract disease including ulceric or 

inflammatory disease, congenital or acquired digestion or 
absorption disorder, disease caused by loss of a mucosal 

barrier function of the gut, or protein-losing 
gastroenteropathy. The invention provides a therapeutic 

agent for the treatment of digestive tract disease comprising 
glicentin as active ingredient and glicentin for use in the 

treatment of digestive tract diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
the use of glicentin for the manufacture of a
medicament for the treatment of digestive tract diseases. Administration of
glicentin to a patient promotes proliferation of digestive
tract mucosa. The use of
glicentin as a therapeutic agent for digestive tract diseases
also causes delayed migration of contents in the digestive tract, thereby
achieving improved gastrointestinal motor symptons or
promoting cure of the same.Glicentin, which is an enteroglucagon, is a
peptide comprising 69 amino acid residues. For example,
human glicentin is composed of the following amino acid
sequence

The sequence contains in positions 33-61 the structure of
glucagon which is a peptide hormone comprising 29 amino acid 
residues. Glicentin and glucagon are produced by tissue
specific processing from the same precursor, preproglucagon.
Glucagon is formed in pancreas and glicentin in intestine.
Regarding physiological roles of these peptides, glucagon is
known to control glycogenolysis and blood glucose level.
However, the role is unknown for glicentin.Glucagon-producing tumors are a very rare disease.
One case was reported by Gleeson et al. in Gut 12, 773-782,
1971, which was characterized by symptoms in small
intestinal structure and function such as thickened small
intestinal villi, delayed passing rate of food through the
digestive tract and constipation. These findings and
symptoms were found to have disappeared after removal of the
tumor by surgical operation, possibility for factors
produced by the tumor to participate in the altered small
intestinal structure and function was postulated. Later, it
was discovered by Bloom in Gut, 13, 520-523, 1972 that the
tumor produced enteroglucagon. It was thus suggested that
such symptoms were due to biological activity of
enteroglucagon. It was further observed in animal
experiments that jejunectomy brought about an increase in
blood enteroglucagon level and a promoted productivity of
cryptocell, by which the proliferating effect of
enteroglucagon on epithelial cells of the intestinal tract
was supported (Brit. J. Surg., 69, 14-18, 1982). It is
however uncertain whether enteroglucagon as a trophic factor 
brings about proliferation of the small intestinal mucosa or
both the increase in blood level and the mucosal
proliferation are due to other factors. In addition, it was
reported that a crude extract of enteroglucagon stimulated
DNA synthesis in cultured cells of the small intestine (O.
Ottenthal et al., Regul. Pept., 3, 84, 1982). However, it
is
