<ABSTRACT>
An artificial snowseed in the form of granules of a 
super water-absorbing polymer already coated with a fluorine-containing 

material and/or a silicone oil. The granules can 
retain the original spherical form after absorption of water 

without sticking to each other. Further the present 

invention provides a method for making artificial snow 
comprising freezing the above artificial snowseed after 

absorption of water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an artificial
snowseed and to a method for making artificial snow. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an artificial,
spherical, granular snowseed of a super water-absorbing
polymer which retains the original spherical form after
absorption of water without sticking to each other. The
spherical snowseed may be of a dry or a water-swollen form.
The snowseed can be used for making artificial snow having an
appearance of granules or rice-flour cakes by freezing. The
resulting artificial snow exhibits good properties for
gliding on skis over the slope covered with such snow, and
the snow conditions may be properly adjusted to skiing.There have recently been a marked decrease in
snowfall and an accumulation of snow. As a result, the
openings of many ski resorts are often hindered. In
addition, in order to prepare a well-groomed packed ski
slope, the natural snow on ski slopes requires frequent
packing by tracksetter because newly fallen natural snow is 
too soft and not suitable for smooth gliding on skis. On the
other hand, the snow conditions on a tracksetter-groomed
trail is not still suitable for a ski racing event, and the
trail has to be groomed by treading it underfoot, followed by
spraying water on the spread snow.The slopes recreated by such means are very
susceptible to the outside air temperature, and the quality
of the snow varies widely from compact to corn with the
passage of time. This is caused by sublimation and
condensation of water molecules inside the snow layer thereby
causing a change in the structure of snow crystals. It is
not easy for skiers to glide smoothly on skis over slopes
covered with corn snow; thus frequent snow-grooming, e.g.
breaking the frozen crust is indispensable. These attempts
are however still unsuccessful in giving a satisfactory
results.Installation of snow machines has been popular in
many skiing resorts to prolong the overall skiing season.
Snow machines fall into two groups consisting mainly of a
"gun" type and a "fan" type. A method of making artificial
snow by snow machines comprises atomizing compressed water
into a subzero atmosphere to make fine ice particles with the
aid of adiabatic expansion of compressed air or the aid of
cold air. The artificial snow thus produced contains 10% by 
weight or more of water, and has a density of about 0.3 to
about 0.4 g/cm3, and a mechanical strength of less than 1
kg/cm2. The slope covered with such artificial snow is not
suitable for skiing without being packed. Such

<CLAIMS>
An artificial snowseed comprising granules of a super
water-absorbing polymer selected from the group

consisting of acrylates, methacrylates, and copolymers
thereof, the polymer having a deionized water absorbing

capability of 30 to 500 times its own weight, and being
coated with a fluorine containing material and/or a

silicone oil, wherein said granules have an average
diameter of 20 to 500 Âµm, can retain the original

spherical form after absorption of water without sticking
to each other, and wherein in the manufacturing process

of the granules 0,05 to 2 % by weight of at least one
crosslinking agent have been added.
An artificial snowseed according to claim 1, wherein said
fluorine-containing material is the same dispersant as

used in the manufacture of granules of said super water-absorbing
polymer by a reversed-phase suspension

polymerization.
An artificial snowseed according to claim 2 wherein said
fluorine-containing material is an acrylic copolymer

containing 10 to 90 % by weight of an acrylic or
methacrylic ester moiety having three or more of fluorine

atoms.
A method for making artificial snow which comprises the
steps of:


(a) swelling granules of a super water-absorbing polymer
according to any of the claims 1 to 3 in water to

provide spherical water-swollen granules having an
average diameter of 0,05 to 2 mm, 
(b) freezing the water-swollen granules by at least one
means selected from the group consisting of the

steps:

(i) freezing the water-swollen granules on a
refrigerated floor laid with refrigeration pipes,
(ii)freezing the water-swollen granules by blending
them with at least one coolant selected from the

group consisting of dry ice, liquid carbon
dioxide, and liquid nitrogen, and
(iii)freezing the water-swollen granules on a
refrigerated floor laid with refrigeration pipes

after blending them with natural snow, artificial
snow made by means of a snow machine, or icy snow

made by shattering ice blocks, freezing the
water-swollen granules on the refrigerated floor

after blending them with at least one coolant
selected from the group consisting of dry ice,

liquid carbon dioxide, and liquid nitrogen.
