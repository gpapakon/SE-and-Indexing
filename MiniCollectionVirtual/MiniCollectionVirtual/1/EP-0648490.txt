<ABSTRACT>
A septicemia suppressing substitution fluid 
preparation for controlling bacterial translocation of 

intestinal bacteria into blood containing at least one 
compound selected from the group consisting of (R)-3-hydroxybutyric 

acid and salts thereof is provided. In 
conditions of septicemia, bacterial translocation of 

intestinal bacteria into blood is suppressed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a substitution 
fluid preparation for suppressing bacterial translocation 
(hereinafter referred to as BT) of intestinal bacteria into 
blood and, more particularly, to a substitution fluid 
preparation containing (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid and/or its 
salts for suppressing BT in case of BT-induced septicemia 
caused by injury to the intestinal mucosa of a patient. As to applications for 3-hydroxybutyric acid, it 
is described in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 
201746/'83 that a pharmaceutical composition containing (R) 
-3-hydroxybutyric acid, salts derived from this acid or 
salts of amino acids is effective for metabolism of and 
protection of cardiac muscle. It is also described in Japanese Laid-open Patent 
Publication No. 502942/'86 that a dialytic fluid which is 
better than any conventional 
dialytic fluid is obtainable by adding a mixture of (R)3-hydroxybutyric 
acid salts and acetoacetic acid salts as 
ketone bodies to the dialytic fluid instead of sodium 
acetate. It is also known that the ketone bodies ((R)-3-hydroxybutyric 
acid and acetoacetic acid) are an excellent  
 
energy sources for peripheral blood vessel tissue.(R)-3-hydroxybutyric 
acid is known to be an important energy 
source and suppresses protein catabolisms and improves 
metabolic acidosis. Further, as to a substitution fluid preparation 
comprising (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid and its salts, in 
Japanese Laid- open Patent Publication No. 191212/'90 an 
application example of 3-hydroxybutyric acid as a supplementing 
extracellular fluid and a maintaining substitution fluid is 
described and actual examples are disclosed in which these 
were applied to patients in the acute stage. 
Although, while in these examples it is emphasized that it 
is an excellent energy source for patients in acute stage, 
no description is made for other applications. For patients with decreased vitality due to 
grave disorders or diseases, a great problem for life-saving 
is that infection and septicemia are inevitable in the 
course of treatment. With, for example, post-operative 
patients, patients with autoimmun conditions, patients with 
tumors, traumatized patients, burned patients etc, it is 
often the case that the decrease in vitality gives rise to 
septicemia resulting in death. Many researchers have studied 
this problem. For example, Deitch E.A. 
et al. reported cases in which BT resulted through the 
intestinal canal membrane (J. Trauma, 1985 25, 385-392).

<CLAIMS>
Use of at least one compound selected from the 
group consisting essentially of (R)-hydroxybutyric acid, 

(RS)-3-hydroxybutyric acid and pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of a 

septicemia suppressing substitution fluid preparation for 
controlling bacterial translocation of intestinal 

bacteria into blood. 
Use according to claim 1, wherein said 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts are alkali metal salts, 

alkaline earth metal salts or salts of amino acids. 
Use 
according to claim 2, wherein said salts of 

amino acids are (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid with amino acids 
added thereto for adjusting a pH of the substitution fluid 

preparation to 5-8. 
Use 
according to claim 2 or claim 3, wherein said 

amino acids are natural neutral amino acids or basic amino 
acids. 
Use 
according to claim 1, wherein said (R)-3-hydroxybutyric 

acid is contained as a mixture of a (R)-isomer 
and a (S)-isomer. 
Use according to claim 1 wherein the septicemia 
suppressing substitution fluid 

 
further contains at least one component selected from 

the group consisting of sugar and inorganic salts, as well as 
at least one component selected from the group consisting of (R)-3-hydroxybutyric 

acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts 
thereof. 
Use of at least one of (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, 
(RS)-3-hydroxybutyric acid, and a pharmaceutically 

acceptable salt thereof for the production of a 
substitution fluid preparation for suppressing septicemia 

derived from bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal-tract 
to the blood of a patient in a state of energy-deficiency 

in the gastrointestinal-tract. 
The use of claim 7, wherein said pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt is an alkali metal salt, an alkaline earth 

metal salt or a salt of an amino acid. 
The use of claim 8, wherein said salt of an amino 
acid is (R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid with an amino acid added 

thereto for adjusting a pH of the substitution fluid 
preparation to 5-8. 
The use of claim 8 or claim 9, wherein said amino 
acid is a natural neutral amino acid or a basic amino acid. 
The use of claim 1, wherein said (R)-3-hydroxybutyric 
acid as a mixture of the (R)-isomer and the (S)-isomer.
