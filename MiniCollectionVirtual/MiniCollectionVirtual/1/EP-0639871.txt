<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) is provided for 
surface mounting on a printed circuit board and includes a 

dielectric housing (12) having a mating face (14) and a 
surface mounting face (16). The mating face includes a 

mating cavity. The surface mounting face includes a 
terminal-receiving passageway (22) communicating with the 

cavity. A terminal (24) is mounted on the housing, the 
terminal being stamped and formed of sheet metal material 

in a T-shaped configuration defining a trunk portion (26) 
and a cross portion (28). The trunk portion extends 

through the passageway (22) and projects into the mating 
cavity (20) of the housing to provide a male terminal pin 

therein. The cross portion is exposed at the surface 
mounting face (16) of the housing for contacting a circuit 

trace on the printed circuit board.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to surface mount 
connectors having terminals surface connected to a printed 
circuit board, as by soldering. A variety of electrical connectors are designed 
for surface mounting to a printed circuit board by 
soldering lead wire terminals of the connectors to circuit 
traces on the surface of the printed circuit board. 
Conventional soldering methods are not used, but reflow 
soldering methods are used for mounting the terminals to 
the board. As for the connectors themselves, the surface 
mount connectors often are of a receptacle-type, and a 
plug-type connector is mated with the surface mounted 
receptacle connector. The plug connector may be terminated 
to lead wires, or the plug connector also may be surface 
mounted to a second printed circuit board whereby, when the 
plug and receptacle connectors are mated, an electrical 
connection is made between two different circuit boards. 
Of course, other interconnecting systems are contemplated 
by the invention. One of the problems often encountered with 
electrical connectors of the character described above 
concerns the design of the connector terminals. Problems 
continue to arise due to the ever-increasing 
miniaturization of the electronic circuit within which  
 
surface mount connectors most often are used. The 
terminals usually are stamped from sheet metal material and 
formed or bent into a desired configuration. For instance, 
a terminal may be stamped or formed into an L-shaped 
configuration, with one leg of the "L" forming a male 
terminal pin in the connector housing, and the other leg 
forming the surface mount portion of the terminal for 
soldering to a circuit trace on the printed circuit board. 
If a plurality of such terminals are mounted to the 
connector housing in a common orientation, a force imbalance 
is created, particularly in a single terminal row 
connector. Therefore, adjacent terminals are alternatingly 
oriented or are placed on alternate sides of the connector 
to give the connector stability on the printed circuit 
board. These requirements increase the manufacturing and 
assembly costs of the connectors. Other surface mount terminals are assembled to a 
connector housing, and then formed by secondary bending 
operations. Again, these additional fabricating steps 
increase the costs of the connectors. This invention is directed to solving these 
problems by providing an improved surface mount terminal 
stamped and formed from
