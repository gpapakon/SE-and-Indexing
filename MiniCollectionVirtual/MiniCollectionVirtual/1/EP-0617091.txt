<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydroxygallium
phthalocyanine crystal useful as a photoconductive material,
a process for the preparation of such a hydroxygallium
phthalocyanine crystal, and an electrophotographic
photoreceptor comprising such a hydroxygallium phthalocyanine
crystal.A phthalocyanine compound is useful as a coating,
printing ink, catalyst or electronic material. In
particular, the application of such a phthalocyanine compound
to an electrophotographic photoreceptor, an optical recording
material, and a photo-electric converter has been extensively
studied.An electrophotographic photoreceptor has recently
been increasingly demanded for the expansion of the sensitive
wavelength range from the sensitive range of the prior art
organic photoconductive material to the wavelength range of
near infrared semiconductor laser (780 to 830 nm), for the
use as a photoreceptor for digital recording in laser
printer. In this respect, squarium compounds (as disclosed
in JP-A-49-105536 and JP-A-58-21416 (The term "JP-A" as used
herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application")), triphenylamine trisazo compounds (as
disclosed in JP-A-61-151659), phthalocyanine compounds (as
disclosed in JP-A-48-34189 and JP-A-57-148745), etc. have
been proposed as photoconductive materials for semiconductor
laser.Organic photoconductive materials to be used as
photoreceptors for semiconductor laser must be sensitive up
to long wavelength range. The photoreceptors formed by the
organic photoconductive materials must exhibit a high
sensitivity and an excellent durability. The foregoing prior
art organic photoconductive materials cannot sufficiently
meet these requirements.In order to overcome these difficulties, the
relationship between the crystal form and the
electrophotographic properties has been studied on the
organic photoconductive materials. In particular, many
reports have been made on phthalocyanine compounds.In general, phthalocyanine compounds are known to
exhibit various crystal forms depending on preparation method
and processing methods.
GB-A 2 255 980 discloses crystals of hydroxygallium phthalocyanine
having distinct diffraction peaks, inter alia at
7.5°, 9.9°, 12.5°, 16.3°, 18.6°, 25.1° and 28.3° of the Bragg
angle, which are used in electrophotographic photoreceptors. It is also known that the difference
in the crystal form has a great effect on the photoelectric
properties of the phthalocyanine compounds. As the crystal
forms of phthalocyanine compounds such as copper
phthalocyanine,
