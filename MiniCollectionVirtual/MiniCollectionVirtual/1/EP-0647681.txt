Article based on a mixture of polyamide and
polyolefin and including at least one weld line,

characterized in that:

the ratio of the viscosities of the
polyolefin to the polyamide, measured between 240 and

290Â°C and at a shear rate higher than 100 s
-1
, is
greater than 0.70,
the quantity of polyamide is sufficient for
the elongation at break to be greater than 10 % and is

at least 58 % by weight.
Article according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the ratio of the viscosities is between 0.75 and

1.2.
Article according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the polyolefin is polypropylene

homopolymer or copolymer.
Article according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the polyolefin contains at least

one functional group chosen from carboxylic acids,
carboxylic esters, acid anhydrides and epoxy groups.
Article according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the mixture also includes a

compatibilizing agent.
Article according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the mixture includes 60 to 70 parts of polyamide,

20 to 30 parts of polypropylene and 3 to 10 parts of
PA-grafted maleinized polypropylene as compatibilizing

agent. 
Article according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the mixture also includes an

impact improver.
