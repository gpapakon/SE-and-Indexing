<ABSTRACT>
Gelled overbased materials are prepared by mixing an 
overbased composition of a metal salt of an organic acid 

material containing at least 8 carbon atoms, a metal salt 
of an organic acid material containing fewer than 6 carbon 

atoms, and a metal carbonate in an oleophilic medium, with 
an alcohol or an alcohol-water mixture, and heating the 

mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing
gelled overbased materials and to lubricants and other
substances containing such gelled overbased materials.Overbased materials have been long known and are
important lubricating oil additives. These materials are
metal salts of acidic organic compounds. Overbased materials
are single phase, homogeneous, and generally apparently
Newtonian systems characterized by a metal content in
excess of that which would be present according to the
stoichiometry of the metal and the particular acidic
organic compound reacted with the metal. Overbased materials
can be converted from their original Newtonian form to
a gelled form by a variety of treatments, some of which are
set forth in certain of the following documents:U.S. Patent 3,242,079, McMillen, discloses a grease
prepared by mixing mineral oil, a carbonated, basic alkaline
earth metal salt of an acid of at least 12 carbon
atoms, and an active hydrogen compound such as a lower
aliphatic carboxylic acid, water, or water-alcohol mixtures.
Addition of acetic acid and mineral oil to overbased
calcium petroleum sulfonate and heating to 100-150Â°C
for about 9 hours forms a grease. Examples illustrate the
use of alcohol/water to effect the grease formation.U.S. Patent 3,492,231, McMillen, discloses preparation
of a non-Newtonian disperse system. The conversion agents
include lower aliphatic carboxylic acids, water, aliphatic
alcohols, cycloaliphatic alcohols, phenols, ketones,
aldehydes, amines, boron acids, phosphorus acids, and
carbon dioxide. Mixtures of two or more of these conversion
agents are also useful. The use of a mixture of water
and one or more of the alcohols is especially effective.U.S. Patent 3,766,066, McMillen, discloses a process
for preparing solid, metal-containing compositions by
isolating the solid from a gelled overbased material. U.S. Patent 4,597,880, Eliades, discloses a 1-step
process for making overbased calcium sulfonate greases,
comprising introducing into a reactor a solution of a
sulfonic acid having an aliphatic chain of at least 12
carbon atoms; calcium oxide and/or calcium hydroxide; minor
proportions of (a) water-soluble carboxylic acids such as,
for example, acetic acid; (b) aliphatic alcohols or alkoxy-alkanols,
such as methyl alcohol or methyl cellosolve; and
(c) water, prior to carrying out a carbonation step.U.S. Patent 3,730,895, Kjonaas, discloses a calcium
overbased carboxylate. Example 6 shows the preparation of
a concentrate composition using a dispersant

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a gelled overbased material,
comprising the steps of:


(a) preparing a mixture of (i) a fluid carbonated overbased
material in an oleophilic medium, which mixture contains a

metal salt of at least one organic acid material containing
at least 8 carbon atoms and a metal salt of at least one

organic acid material containing fewer than 6 carbon atoms,
and (ii) after preparing the fluid carbonated

overbased material, adding thereto an alcohol or an
alcohol-water mixture; and
(b) heating the mixture of (a), whereby the gelled
composition is formed.
The process of claim 1 wherein the fluid carbonated overbased
material is prepared by reacting a mixture of at least one

organic acid material containing at least 8 carbon atoms or a
reactive equivalent thereof and at least one organic acid

material containing fewer than 6 carbon atoms or a reactive
equivalent thereof with a stoichiometric excess of a metal salt

and carbonating the mixture.
The process of claim 1 wherein the fluid carbonated overbased
material is prepared by reacting at least one organic acid

material containing at least 8 carbon atoms or a reactive
equivalent thereof with a stoichiometric excess of a metal salt,

carbonating the mixture, and adding to the mixture a metal salt
of an organic acid material containing fewer than 6 carbon atoms

or a substance which forms a metal salt of an organic acid
material containing fewer than 6 carbon atoms upon interaction

with a metallic base.
The process of claim 1, 2, or 3 wherein the oleophilic medium
is an oil.
The process of claim 1, 2, or 3 wherein the oleophilic medium
is a volatile organic solvent.
The process of claim 1 wherein the salt of the acid material
of at least 8 carbon atoms is a calcium salt of a saturated

carboxylic acid having 10 to 22 carbon atoms and the salt of the
organic acid material containing fewer than 6 carbon atoms is a

calcium salt of a carboxylic acid having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.
The process of claim 6 wherein the carboxylic acid containing
1 to 4 carbon atoms is acetic acid.
The process of claim 1 wherein the alcohol or alcohol water
mixture is a mixture comprising isopropanol and water. 
The process of claim 1, 2, or 3 further comprising the step
of removing at least a substantial portion of the medium and

isolating a resulting solid.
The process of claim 1, 2, or 3 further comprising the steps
of


(c) admixing the material obtained from step (b) with a
replacement medium; and
(d) removing the oleophilic medium.
The process of claim 9 or 10 further comprising the step of mixing the product
obtained thereby with an oleophilic medium.
