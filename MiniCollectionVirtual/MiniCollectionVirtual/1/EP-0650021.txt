<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for treating flat surfaces which makes it possible to prevent the appearance of condensation water on said surfaces or to eliminate this water if it has already formed, characterised in that it comprises a stage consisting in generating jets of hot air in the region of said surface in an essentially horizontal plane essentially parallel to said surface, said jets of hot air being projected in directions which are brought together so as to produce a co-entrainment of the jets which makes it possible to increase their range. The invention also relates to an installation for implementing such a method comprising at least one insufflation mouth (2) installed in the region of a flat surface (1) to be treated, which makes possible the projection of at least one jet of hot air (3) in the region of said surface (2) in a plane which is essentially horizontal and essentially parallel thereto, at least one high-pressure ventilation apparatus (4) capable of generating the hot air at high pressure, and at least one duct (5) making it possible to channel the air at high pressure generated by said ventilation apparatus(es) (4) to said mouth (1).
