<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition of a water soluble 
pharmacologically active peptide in a matrix of a biodegradable polyester having an 
excellent agent release profile and stability. The invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising as an active agent 
a peptide e.g. a protein in association with embonic acid or ascorbic acid or a salt 
thereof, excluding 
1) ACTH in association with embonic acid or ascorbic acid or a salt thereof and 2) a LHRH active compound in association with ascorbic acid or a salt thereof, in a matrix of a polylactide, having a lactide/glycolide molar ratio of from 100:0 to 
40:60, a Mw of from 10.000 to 200.000 and a polydispersity of from 1.7 to 3.0. The LHRH active compounds comprise LHRH agonists and antagonists and their 
analogues and salts thereof. The peptide may be a protein. Usable peptides are such having a molecular weight of 1 to 300 k Dalton, e.g. 
enzymes and blood factors (Mw 20 - 300 k Da), immunizing antigens and antibodies 
(Mw up to 200 k Da), cytokines (Mw 10 - 30 k Da) and peptides having a molecular 
weight of 1 to 10 k Da. The most usable peptides have a molecular weight range of 
1 more preferably 1.5 to 150 k Da. According to the PCT-patent application WO 93/17668 ACTH controlled release  
 
sytems in polymers are described containing excipients which are polymer 
degradation enhancers, e.g. organic acids like benzoic acid and ascorbic acid (page 
14, lines 4-13). The US-patent 4,675,189 describes e.g. organic acids and their salts, e.g. ascorbic 
acid to be used as polymer hydrolysis modifying agents in LHRH active controlled 
release systems in polymers, e.g. polylactides (Column 11, lines 5-19). It could not be expected, that these type of compounds may improve the stability of 
pharmacologically active peptides and proteins in polymers, especially polylactides. According to the present invention it has been found that embonic acid and ascorbic 
acid behave as stabilisators of peptides, e.g. proteins in polylactides, especially 
those peptides not excluded in the combination as mentioned before. The invention especially provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising such a 
peptide in a matrix of the polylactide mentioned above, the composition showing, 
after manufacture thereof, an increase of at most 0.5% in active agent degradation 
products resulting in a total degradation product content of at most 2.5% and the 
active agent being in association with embonic acid or ascorbic acid or a salt thereof 
and the
