<ABSTRACT>
This consists firstly of cleaning the surface to 
be treated, particularly aluminium profiles and sheets, 

with substances such as trichloroethylene, and then drying 
the item. A layer of acrylic or vinylic primer or wash primer is 

applied and dried. Then solvents are applied to soften the surface 
and a mechanical treatment by brushing, stamping or by 

spraying chemical solvents with pigments is applied. 
Finally the surface is dried and a varnishing treatment is 

applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention consists of a process for 
treatment of all kinds of aluminium profiles and sheets for 
decorating and protecting these, enabling production of 
finishes of said surfaces which resemble other materials, 
such as wood or natural stone. At the present time, there are electrolytic 
anodizing techniques for aluminium with which the uniform 
colouring of the surface treated is obtained. We should 
here point out the existence of patent ES-547677 which 
deals with an electrolytic process for the treatment of 
aluminium surfaces. Patent ES-2004433 refers to a process for double 
anodizing treatment of an aluminium item. The process 
according to this patent consists of a first stage of 
cleaning and polishing the surface, a first electrolytic 
coating, a mechanical phase destroying this first coating, 
and a further treatment which affects only the surface 
destroyed. This process has the disadvantage of involving 
a double anodizing process, and of having to destroy the 
first layer of electrolytic coating with great accuracy, 
and consequent high costs, in order to avoid damaging the 
material, and also that this damage means the second 
coating is unstable, giving unwanted results. Furthermore, 
by means of this process a surface cannot be treated to 
make it resemble wood. ES-2022021 refers to a process and installation 
for continuous varnishing and decoration of metal sheets, 
and to a metal sheet obtained by the aforementioned  
 
process. This process, though not specifically applied to 
aluminium surfaces, consists of the application of 
anticorrosive metal deposits and the application of an 
anticorrosive varnish based on polyester-epoxy resins, and 
the firing and drying of the item. This process is also 
incapable of obtaining a surface looking like wood, for 
example. There are numerous processes for treatment of 
metal surfaces, apart from the aforementioned ones, 
particularly for colouring and decorating these, but the 
imitation of surfaces of items such as wood or natural 
rocks has not been efficiently solved to date. The aim of this invention is to obtain a process 
for treatment of aluminium surfaces so that these can 
reproduce surfaces looking like wood or other finishes. One characteristic of the invention is that the 
treatment can be carried out on properly treated aluminium 
surfaces or on surfaces that have undergone an anodizing 
process. The process referred to herein consists 
substantially of a succession of three stages, in which 
the first of said stages

<CLAIMS>
1.- A process for the treatment of aluminium 
profiles and sheets which enables production of finishes of 

said surfaces likening them to other materials, such as 
wood or natural stone, characterized by consisting of the 

following stages. 
   A first stage consisting of cleaning the surface 

with a degreasing substance, and the application of an 
adherent vinylic or acrylic primer, or what is commercially 

known as wash primer, in combination with a colouring agent 
that withstands the action of ultraviolet rays, and further 

consisting of drying the same, either in ambient conditions 
or by means of the application of draughts, heat or both; 

   a second stage consisting of projecting onto the 
dry surface a layer of solvent combined with ceramic 

pigments and formation of the surface pattern; and 
   a third, for fixing the surface pattern by 

applying a protective varnish. 
2.- A process, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the solvent used for the projection 

onto the surface being treated has a level of greasiness 
which depends on the drying time required for each case. 
3.- A process, according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the solvent used for projection onto 

the surface treated is ethyl acetate. 
4.- A process, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the formation of the surface pattern 

is carried out by the pressure exerted by a brush. 
5.- A process, according to claim 4, 
 

characterized in that the bristles of the brush can be 
moved at will, both statically and dynamically. 
6.- A process, according to claim 1, 
characterized because the formation of the surface pattern 

is carried out by stamping. 
7.- A process, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the formation of the surface pattern 

is carried out by means of applying drops of solvent mixed 
with pigments. 
8.- A process, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fixing of the surface is done by 

means of providing a mixture of acrylic and fluorinated 
polymers, for surfaces which require a high degree of 

resistance. 
9.- A process, according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the fixing of the surface is carried 

out by means of applying an acrylic substance, for surfaces 
that do not require a high degree of resistance.
