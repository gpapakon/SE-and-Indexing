<ABSTRACT>
An electro-optic transducing element used in the field of information communication. This element has a semi-transparent 
reflecting layer (2) on a transparent substrate (1), a transparent conductive layer (3) on the semi-transparent 

reflection layer (2), a 
luminescent layer (5) of an organic thin film on the transparent conductive layer (3), and electrodes (7) formed on the layer (5). 

The semi-transparent reflective layer (2) transmits a part of the light emitted by the luminescent layer (5) toward the transparent 
substrate (1), and reflects a part of the light toward the luminescent layer (5). The semi-transparent 

reflection layer (2) forms resonators 
together with the electrodes (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic light emitting device
suitable for use in display devices, light emitting devices for
communications, information file reading/writing heads, printing
apparatuses, and similar devices and apparatuses, and to a
substrate plate for use in its manufacture.Previously proposed organic light emitting devices include, for
example, an organic electro-luminescent cell disclosed in the
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 57-51781. The cell has
a light emitting body of organic light emitting material and
electrically insulating binder interposed between transparent
substrates having transparent electrodes of indium tin oxide or 
the like. A compound layer of a porphyrin system is formed
between the positive one of the transparent electrodes and the
light emitting body. The organic electro-luminescent cell has a
hole injecting body of the compound of a porphyrin system to inject
holes on the basis of a signal voltage applied between the two
electrodes, to cause light to be emitted.Such light emitting devices having an organic thin film used
therein are advantageous in fabrication at low cost. However,
their use is limited to display panels as their spectral half-widths
are too wide. They are also available only for a single
display color as the specific material can emit only one color
of light.It is an object of the present invention to provide an organic light
emitting device having improved spectra width and light emitting
characteristics.Another object of the present invention is to provide a substrate 
plate for use in manufacture of an organic light emitting
device.In a first aspect, the present invention provides an
organic light-emitting device as set out in claim 1.In a second aspect the invention provides a substrate
plate for use in the manufacture of the organic light
emitting device of the invention, as set out in claim 12.In the organic light emitting device of the invention,
preferably there is a hole-injecting layer between the
transparent conductive layer and the light emitting
layer. Preferably also there is an electron-injecting
layer between the light emitting layer and the second
electrode.Preferably the optical distance L between the semi-transparent
reflective layer and the second electrode on
the light emitting layer is given
0.9 n P < L < 1.1 n P
where n is a positive integer and P is the peak
wavelength of the light emitted by the device. The optical distance L between the semi-transparent
