<ABSTRACT>
In a switch (2) for electrically operated devices, especially domestic appliances, with a rotating switching spindle (4) which transmits the switching movement from a turn-button (6) to a switch contact (15, 16), the switching spindle (4) has a longitudinal drilling (24) in which a switching pin (5) is arranged to be axially movable, one end of which can be pushed further into the switching spindle (4) against a resetting force and converts an axial movement into a radial switching movement of switching cams (23) which act upon the switch contact (15, 16). This provides useful short-term operation in a simple manner.

<CLAIMS>
A switch for electrically powered apparatus, in
particular for domestic appliances, with a rotary actuating

shaft (4) transmitting the switching operation from a
rotary handle (6) to a switch contact (15, 16), said actuating

shaft (4) including a longitudinal bore (24) in
which an actuating rod (5) is axially movably disposed,

an end of said rod being adapted to be urged into the actuating
shaft (4) for a depth of some length in opposition

to a restoring force,
characterized in that
 a transmission
element (23) is provided on the actuating shaft

(4) for converting an axial motion of the actuating rod
(5) into a radial control motion that is transmitted to

the switch contact (15, 16) when the switch (2) is in the
inactivated position.
The switch of claim 1,
characterized in that
 the transmission
element (23) is part of a resilient tongue (26)

disposed on the actuating shaft (4) and comprised of wall
sections separated from the actuating shaft (4) by elongate

slots (49) on its sides, and that the actuating rod
(5) includes a ramp (28) inclined towards its longitudinal

axis, opposite said ramp being a sliding surface (27)
provided on the control cam (23) to act as a further

ramp, so that on an axial displacement of the actuating
rod (5) the control cam (23) is movable radially outwardly

into engagement with the switch contact (15, 16). 
The switch of claim 1,
characterized in that
 the restoring
force is produced by a compression spring (29) seated

between abutment surfaces (31, 32) of the actuating rod
(5) and the actuating shaft (4).
The switch of claim 3,
characterized in that
 the actuating
rod (5) is provided with a longitudinal bore (30)

into which the compression spring (29) extends.
The switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that
 a control
cam (13, 14) is provided on the circumferential surface

of the actuating shaft (4), said cam being movable into
engagement with the switch contact (15, 16, 17) by rotation

of the actuating shaft (4).
The switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that
 the actuating
rod (5) has on its outside detent hooks (33) adapted

for locking engagement with cutouts (35) provided in the
wall of the actuating shaft (4) to thereby retain the actuating

rod (5) in a neutral position in opposition to
the restoring force.
The switch as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
characterized in that
 the actuating
shaft (4) and the actuating rod (5) are lockable by a

latch (36) in a neutral position in which the drive
mechanism of the appliance is turned off, said latch (36)

being movable into an interlock deactivated position only 
by the closing of a safety device (45), in which position

the actuating shaft (4) and the actuating rod (5) are
freely movable for performing switching motions.
The switch of claim 7,
characterized in that
 the latch
(36) locks the safety device (45) against opening in the

interlock deactivated position of the switch (2).
The switch of either claim 7 or claim 8,
characterized in that
 in the interlock
activated position the latch (36) radially engages

relatively aligned openings (46, 47) in the actuating
shaft (4) and in the actuating rod (5), and that in

the interlock deactivated position the openings (46, 47)
are movable out of the range of motion of the latch (36)

by the actuating shaft (4) or the actuating rod (5) executing
a switching operation, the actuating shaft (4) or

the actuating rod (5) thus preventing the latch (36) from
returning to the interlock activated position.
The switch of claims 7 to 9,
characterized in that
 the latch
(36) includes a two-armed rotary lever (37) whose one arm

(42) carries a latch (36) extending tangentially to the
axis of rotation of the lever (37), and whose other arm

(43) carries at its end a bifurcated coupling member (44)
cooperating with a coupling pin (45) of the safety device

and embracing the coupling pin in the interlock deactivated
position. 
The switch as claimed in any one of the preceding

claims,
characterized in that
 the rotary
handle (6) includes a dial (7) having a central opening

from which the end of the actuating rod (5) protrudes,
and that the opening in the dial (7) is closed by an

elastically deformable cap (25) covering the end of the
actuating rod (5).
