<ABSTRACT>
In the method according to the invention, a layer of polyurethane elastomer for obtaining a polyurethane skin (5) is produced, in a first step, against a mould surface (1). In a second step, a reaction mixture for obtaining a polyurethane foam layer (6) is applied against this polyurethane skin (5). In a third step, a suitable polyurethane or polyisocyanurate reaction mixture for obtaining a rigid synthetic carrier (8) is applied against the polyurethane foam layer (6). In this way, a synthetic trim part is obtained which is easier to recycle. This method can moreover also be performed easier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing self-supporting synthetic trim parts, in 
particular car interior parts such as dashboards, 
doorpanels, consoles and glove compartments, having an 
elastomeric polyurethane skin, a rigid synthetic carrier 
and a mainly open-cell polyurethane foam layer there-between. Such a method is for example already 
disclosed in the Belgian patent application No. 08900228 
of the same applicant. In this method, a layer of 
polyurethane elastomer is first sprayed against an inner 
surface of a mould. Then, a previously manufactured 
insert is positioned into this mould and the space 
between the insert and the elastomeric layer is filled 
with a polyurethane foam. A drawback of this known method consists 
in that the insert, or in other words the rigid carrier, 
has to be manufactured in advance in a separate mould. 
This insert must moreover be accurately positioned into 
the second mould in order that the foam layer would have 
everywhere the desired thickness. Especially when this 
foam layer has to be thin, an exact positioning of the 
insert is important since a small variation of the foam 
thickness becomes in this event soon perceptible from 
the outside. In the case of thin foam layers, extending 
over a large surface, it is further difficult in the 
known method to spread the reaction mixture for obtaining 
this foam sufficiently homogeneously over this 
surface.  
 The invention aims now to obviate these 
different drawbacks and this by proposing a new method 
for manufacturing self-supporting synthetic trim parts 
which permits moreover the trim parts to be recycled in 
a simpler way after they have been put out of use. This method is characterized according to 
the invention by the fact that, in a first step, a 
polyurethane skin of a polyurethane elastomer and 
prepared either or not in advance is applied against a 
mould surface ; in a second step, a reaction mixture 
for obtaining said polyurethane foam layer is applied by 
spraying against said polyurethane skin ; and, in a 
third step, a suitable polyurethane or polyisocyanurate 
reaction mixture for obtaining said rigid synthetic 
carrier is applied against the polyurethane foam layer. A similar method for manufacturing a trim 
part having an elastomeric skin, a rigid synthetic 
carrier and a foam layer therebetween is disclosed in 
JP-A-2047022. In this known method a PVC/ABS skin 
having an adjoining polyolefin foam layer is positioned 
into a mould and the rigid carrier, in this case rigid
