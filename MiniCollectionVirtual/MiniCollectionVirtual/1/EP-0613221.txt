<ABSTRACT>
A multistage optical fibre amplifier, in which optical signal components propagate on different paths and are superimposed in the same sense also causes additional noise in the optical receiver as well as the noise caused by the spontaneous emission in the optical fibre amplifier. A two-stage optical fibre amplifier is specified in which a first optical waveguide piece (F1) is pumped counter to or in the propagation direction of the optical signal and a second optical waveguide piece (F2) is pumped in or counter to the propagation direction of the optical signal. A pumping light source (1), the optical waveguide pieces (F1, F2) and couplers (K1, K2, K3) are arranged such that signal components which possibly propagate on different paths are not superimposed in the same sense.

a pump-light source (1), first and second sections of
optical fiber (F1, F2) doped with a rare-earth
