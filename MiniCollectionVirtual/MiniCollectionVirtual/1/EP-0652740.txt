<CLAIMS>
A carboxyl-containing polycondensation product 
comprising 


a) structural units of the formula 

b) radicals derived from tricarboxylic or tetracarboxylic 
acids capable of anhydride formation and 
c) structural units derived from diols, diamines or 
amino alcohols, where 


R
is hydrogen, C₁- to C₈-alkyl or phenyl. 
A polycondensation product as claimed in claim 1, 
containing as component b) pyromellitic acid, the monoanhydride 

or dianhydride thereof or the compounds of the 
formulae 


A polycondensation product as claimed in claim 1, 
which contains
 
from 30 to 87% by weight of a),
 
from 10 to 32% by weight of b) and
 
from 3 to 48% by weight of c). 
A product as claimed in claim 1, containing
 
from 40 to 80% by weight of a),
 
from 16 to 30% by weight of b) and
 
from 4 to 30% by weight of c).  

 
The use of a polycondensation product as claimed 
in any of claims 1 to 4 as a hair treatment composition.
