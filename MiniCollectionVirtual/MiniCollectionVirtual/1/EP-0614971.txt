<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a γ-cyclodextrin 
glucanotransferase having novel properties, to a process for 

the production of the γ-cyclodextrin glucanotransferase which 
comprises culturing a strain belonging to the genus 


Brevibacterium
 capable of producing cyclodextrin 
glucanotransferase, thereby allowing the strain to produce 

the γ-cyclodextrin glucanotransferase in a culture medium, 
and subsequently collecting the enzyme, to a process for the 

production of cyclodextrin which comprises allowing the 
cyclodextrin glucanotransferase to react with substrate 

dissolved in a solution, thereby effecting formation of γ-cyclodextrin 
as a main product, and to a method for 

increasing γ-cyclodextrin yield without accompanying yield 

increase of total cyclodextrin, which comprises adding ethyl 
alcohol to a reaction solution in which γ-cyclodextrin and β-cyclodextrin 

are formed from starch by the action of γ-cyclodextrin 
glucanotransferase, thereby effecting repressed 

formation of β-cyclodextrin and enhanced formation of γ-cyclodextrin. 
Development of the process of this invention 

has rendered possible low cost production of γ-cyclodextrin 
and therefore expands practical use of γ-cyclodextrin to the 

field of food and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a substantially pure novel
cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (EC 2.4.1.19, to be referred
to as "CGTase" hereinafter), a process for the production of
the novel enzyme and a process for the production of
cyclodextrin (to be referred to as "CD" hereinafter) using
the novel enzyme. More particularly, it relates to a process
for the production of the novel CGTase which comprises
culturing a strain belonging to the genus Brevibacterium
capable of producing CGTase, thereby allowing the strain to
produce the novel CGTase in a culture medium, and
subsequently collecting the enzyme, to a process for the
production of CD which comprises allowing the CGTase to react
with a substrate in a solution, thereby effecting formation
of γ-cyclodextrin (to be referred to as "γ-CD" hereinafter)
as the main product, and to a method for increasing γ-CD
yield without accompanying yield increase of total
cyclodextrin (to be referred to as "T-CD" hereinafter) which
comprises adding ethyl alcohol to a reaction solution in
which γ-CD and β-cyclodextrin (to be referred to as "β-CD"
hereinafter) are formed by the action of CGTase, thereby
repressing formation of β-CD and enhancing formation of γ-CD. CD is a non-reducing circular maltooligosaccharide
which is formed from glucose molecules by α-1,4-glucoside
bonding. Since CD can form an inclusion compound by
incorporating various guest molecules into the cavity of the
circle of host molecules and change physical and chemical
properties of the incorporated guest molecules, use of CD
renders possible stabilization of compounds which are
sensitive to oxidation or optical decomposition, fixation of
volatile compounds, solubilization of hardly soluble
compounds and deodorization of odor substances. Because of
such capabilities, CD is used broadly in the field of
pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics, agricultural
chemicals and food.It is well known that typical CD includes α-CD
consisting of 6 glucose molecules, β-CD consisting of 7
glucose molecules and γ-CD consisting of 8 glucose molecules,
of which γ-CD is considered most useful in the field of
pharmaceutical preparations, cosmetics, agricultural
chemicals, food industries and the like due to its high
solubility and excellent capability to form inclusion
compounds.Most of the CGTases known to date are those which
produce α-CD and β-CD, and a CGTase capable of producing only
γ-CD or γ-CD as a main product (γ-cyclodextrin
glucanotransferase; to be referred to as "γ-CGTase" 
hereinafter) is known only in a few
