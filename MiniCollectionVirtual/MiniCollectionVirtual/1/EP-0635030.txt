<ABSTRACT>
Novel immunotoxins and methods of treating neoplastic diseases are provided. More specifically, immunotoxins comprised conjugation of a c-erbB-2 targeting moiety and a cell growth modulator are provided. These immunotoxins specifically and selectively kill tumor cells that over-express the c-erbB-2 protein. The novel immunotoxins would be useful in treating human mammary carcinomas, human ovarian carcinomas, lung carcinomas, gastric tumors, salivary gland adenocarcinomas, and colon adenocarcinomas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
the field of treatment of neoplastic disease. More
specifically, the present invention relates to novel
immunoconjugates and their use in the treatment of
neoplastic disease.Neoplastic disease is one of the leading
causes of mortality and morbidity in the Western World.
Neoplastic conditions, e.g., diseases or "cancers",
share at least one characteristic, i.e., the
involvement of defects in the cellular growth
regulatory process.The process by which normal cells are
transformed into malignant cells has been a subject of
intense study for decades. More recently, study has
focused on the role of oncogenes in the cancer process.
Oncogenes are genes that have the ability to transform
eukaryotic cells so that they grow in a manner
analogous to tumor cells.An oncogene is created when a normal gene or
proto-oncogene is mutated, rearranged, or amplified.
One such oncogene is the c-erbB-2(HER-2/neu) proto-oncogene.
Hereinafter this oncogene will be referred
to as c-erbB-2. This gene encodes a protein similar to
the epidermal growth factor receptor. Amplification of
this proto-oncogene can result in a cascade of cellular
events leading to unregulated cell growth. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system of an animal,
normally in response to foreign antigens or antigenic determinants.
Antibodies bind to the specific antigen to which they are directed. The
development of specific monoclonal antibodies has provided investigators
with a possible means of selectively targeting therapeutic agents to cells
which overexpress defined antigens.Tecce et al (Anti-Cancer Research 1990, Vol. 10(5A) page 1454) have
produced immunotoxins to HER-2 product which employ two monoclonal
antibodies recognizing different epitopes on gp185 that have been conjugated
to the plant toxin saporin. Sivam et al (Cancer Research 47, 3169-3175, 15
June 1987) have covalently linked gelonin to monoclonal antibody 9.2.27,
directed to a human melanoma-associated glycoprotein/proteoglycan.Overexpression of the c-erbB-2 proto-oncogene in neoplastic
transformation has been postulated. Several types of human cancers
including some mammary carcinomas and some ovarian carcinomas have an
amplified c-erbB-2 gene. Moreover, amplification and subsequent
overexpression of the c-erbB-2 gene has been correlated with poor disease
prognosis. Thus, there exists a great need and desire in this art for a method
of selectively targeting a chemotherapeutic agent to a cell which exhibits
overexpression of the
