<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a production method for a fine granulate having a grain size of not greater than 0.2 mm which includes 
a granulation step of spraying a binder or a liquid containing the binder and a surfactant to the surface of a fine powdery 

material having a mean particle size of not greater than 10 µm under stirring, rolling or fluidization, and to the resulting fine 
granulate thus obtained. In the field of medicines, the present invention makes it possible to produce pharmaceuticals which must 

keep high contents of slight soluble and slight absorbable medicine components and a basis. In the field of foodstuffs and fertilizers, 
too, the present invention can provide fine granulate having high usability as powder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
a microgranulated particle. More specifically, it relates
to a method for producing a microgranulated particle, which
can provide a powdery microgranulated particle, which is
suitable for pharmaceutical preparations of poorly soluble
or poorly absorbable drugs and pharmaceutical preparations
for which the content of the active ingredient should be
kept high in the pharmaceutical field; and which is easy-to-handle
also in the fields of food and fertilizers.Before a pharmaceutical product exerts its
pharmacological effects, the active ingredient (drug) in an
oral solid pharmaceutical preparation is released from the
preparation in the digestive tract, dissolved in humoral
fluid and absorbed into circulating blood. Poorly soluble
drugs, however, may fail to satisfactorily exhibit the
pharmacological effects because they, because of low
solubility, are sometimes excreted out of the body before
they are completely dissolved. To date various methods have
been investigated for improving the solubility of poorly
soluble drugs. For example, a poorly soluble drug is
co-milled with a β-1,4-glucan powder (Japanese Patent
Examined Publication No. 53-22138), a poorly soluble drug is 
kneaded with a water-soluble polymeric base material
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 61-63614) and a poorly
soluble drug is adsorbed to and carried by the surface of
processed starch (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 63-101333).Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-129220 discloses a
process for the production of a solid preparation
containing a hardly soluble medicinal component having
rapid action and high bioavailability. The hardly
soluble medicament is compounded with various carriers,
optionally including a surface active agent by dissolving
in an organic solvent and the mixture is granulated using
a fluidised bed granulator.It has long been known that the absorbability of
orally administered poorly soluble drugs, in particular,
depends on particle size. In such oral preparations the
active ingredient is released after disintegration of the
tablet, coating or capsule, and the smaller the particle
of the active ingredient is, the more rapidly the active
ingredient can be dissolved and absorbed in the digestive
tract after administration. Therefore, it is a common
practice to make poorly soluble drugs as fine as possible
by pulverizing, etc. To produce such a finely milled
active ingredient, however, it is necessary to use a
special pulverising device or to dry the active
ingredient
