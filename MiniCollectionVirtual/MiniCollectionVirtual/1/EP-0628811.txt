<ABSTRACT>
A method, based on resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS), for 
determining flaws in objects or measuring 

Poisson's ratio (σ) and shear modulus (µ) is shown and described. 
First, the frequency for expected degenerate responses is 

determined for one or more input frequencies and then splitting of 
degenerate resonant modes are observed to identify the presence of 

flaws in the object. Poisson's ratio and the shear modulus can be 
determined by identification of resonances dependent only on the 

shear modulus, and then using that shear modulus to find Poisson's 
ratio using other modes dependent on both the shear modulus and 

Poisson's ratio. 
In an apparatus for carrying out the method, a signal generator (14) 
excites a transducer (16) for vibrating object (12) over a predetermined 

freq. range eg 4-4000 kHz. The response of object (12) is detected by 
transducer (18) and supplied to output amplifier (22). The outputs from 

amplifier (22) are input to computer (24) for analysis and computation of 
the difference between the resonant vibrational modes of object (12) and 

those of an ideal object.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with government support under Contract 
No. W-7405-ENG-36 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The 
government has certain rights in the invention. This invention relates to nondestructive testing and, more 
particularly, to nondestructive detection of flaws in objects. A 
flaw may be a crack in an object, a void in an object, and/or a 
deviation from dimensional specifications of the object, and any 
other parameter that causes a change in mechanical resonance. Computational procedures have been developed to find the 
mechanical resonances of objects other than a sphere but which also 
have some symmetries. This work is described in "On the modes of 
free vibrations on inhomogeneous and anisotropic elastic objects" 
by Visscher et al., J. Acoust Soc. Am., 90 (4) p. 2154, 1991. 
Examples are, objects, such as a cylinder, rectangular parallel 
piped, cone, ellipsoid, or pyramids with regular polygon bases. This invention relates to a method of determination of flaws 
in an object. The flaws may be in the form of surface or  
 
subsurface cracks, tolerance errors, voids inside of the object or 
any other physical characteristics which would separate otherwise 
degenerate resonant frequencies. In the method of this invention, 
the existence and frequencies of degenerate resonant vibrational 
modes are first calculated or predicted by means of a mathematical 
analysis of the object to be tested. The object is then examined 
by exciting it with a mechanical transducer such that the 
excitation frequency is slowly varied from one predetermined 
frequency to another. From the prediction, modes are identified 
that should be degenerate (i.e. several modes will vibrate at 
precisely the same frequency) in an unflawed object. If flaws 
exist, the degenerate modes are resolved (or split) into two or 
more closely spaced resonances. Objects exhibiting resolved or 
split modes are identified as flawed or defective. In this invention, applicant also provides for measurement of 
the shear modulus (µ) and Poisson's ratio (σ), both of which are 
dependant upon frequencies. Testing of objects by use of sound (including ultrasound) and 
vibrations is well known. The prior art is extensive and 
encompasses many types of non-destructive testing. Resonant sound 
and ultrasound has also been used for testing purposes as described 
in U.S. Patents 5,062,296 and 4,976,148. To achieve the foregoing and other objects, and in accordance 
with the purposes of the present invention, as embodied and
