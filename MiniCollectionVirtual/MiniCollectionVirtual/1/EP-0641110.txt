<ABSTRACT>
A reduced speed equalizer is provided which receives signal samples at a first rate but 
performs the equalizing operation at a second, lower rate which is below the rate at which 

symbols are transmitted across the channel. The equalizer is clocked to receive samples in 
a shift register at the first rate. Samples stored in the shift register are clocked into a set of 

buffers at the second rate. The equalizer coefficients are applied to the samples stored in the 
buffer set to generate a sequence of equalized symbols at the second rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for receiving telecommunications signals and, more
particularly, to an apparatus and method for equalizing received signals.As information service providers offer more services through cable television, the
demand for cable television bandwidth will greatly increase. Similarly, the introduction of
high definition television (HDTV) channels, which require a significantly larger bandwidth
than conventional television channels, will consume a large portion of the available cable
television bandwidth. The number of cable television channels and bandwidth available,
however, are limited.One technique for improving the bandwidth efficiency of a channel is to multiplex
multiple data signals for transmission on a single channel. This technique permits a greater
amount of data to be transmitted over the channel for a given time period, but requires a
receiver apparatus capable of operating at the higher data rate. As the data rate increases, so
does the receiver complexity and cost. Consumer products, such as cable television reception
equipment, however, must be reasonably priced if those products are to be widely successful
in the marketplace. EP-A-0423921 discloses apparatus as set out in the preamble of claim 1,
carrying out, in use, a method as set out in the preamble of claim 7. The apparatus
converts digital video signals between two digital signal formats (D1 and D2) and
carries out a combined band pass filtering, interpolation and matrixing function, while
converting between a 13.5 MHz data rate for the D1 format and a 14.318 MHz data rate
for the D2 format.Apparatus and method according to the invention are set out in the
independent claims. Preferred forms are set out in the dependent claims. An improved equalizer is provided which receives signal samples at a first rate but 
performs the equalizing operation at a second rate which is lower than the signaling rate (i.e.,
the rate at which symbols are transmitted across the channel). The equalizer is clocked to
receive samples in a shift register at the first rate. Selected samples from the shift register are
clocked into a set of buffers at the second rate. The equalizer coefficients are applied to the
samples stored in the buffer set to generate a sequence of equalized symbols. Moreover,
because the equalizer outputs symbols at the lower, second rate, the effect of bursty noise in
the receiver is mitigated.In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the equalizer is an element of a receiver
designed to operate on
