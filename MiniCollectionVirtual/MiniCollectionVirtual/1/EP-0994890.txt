<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain benzimidazole derivatives and their
use in medical therapy particularly for the treatment or prophylaxis of virus
infections such as those caused by herpes viruses. The invention also
relates to the preparation of the benzimidazole derivatives and
pharmaceutical formulations containing them.Of the DNA viruses, those of the herpes group are the source of the most
common viral illnesses in man. The group includes herpes simplex virus
types 1 and 2 (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV),
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6) and human
herpes virus type 7 (HHV-7) and type 8 (HHV-8). HSV-1 and HSV-2 are
some of the most common infectious agents of man. Most of these viruses
are able to persist in the host's neural cells; once infected, individuals are at
risk of recurrent clinical manifestations of infection which can be both
physically and psychologically distressing.HSV infection is often characterized by extensive and debilitating lesions of
the skin, mouth and/or genitals. Primary infections may be subclinical
although tend to be more severe than infections in individuals previously
exposed to the virus. Ocular infection by HSV can lead to keratitis or
cataracts thereby endangering the host's sight. Infection in the new-born, in
immunocompromised patients or penetration of the infection into the central
nervous system can prove fatal. VZV is a herpes virus which causes chickenpox and shingles. Chickenpox is
the primary disease produced in a host without immunity, and in young
children is usually a mild illness characterized by a vesicular rash and fever.
Shingles or zoster is the recurrent form of the disease which occurs in adults
who were previously infected with VZV. The clinical manifestations of
shingles are characterized by neuralgia and a vesicular skin rash that is
unilateral and dermatomal in distribution. Spread of inflammation may lead to
paralysis or convulsions. Coma can occur if the meninges become affected.
VZV is of serious concern in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs for
transplant purposes or for treatment of malignant neoplasia and is a serious
complication of AIDS patients due to their impaired immune system.In common with other herpes viruses, infection with CMV leads to a lifelong
association of virus and host. Congenital HCMV disease is characterized by
jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, petechial rash and multiple organ dysfunction
and is associated with long-term sequelae such as hearing loss
