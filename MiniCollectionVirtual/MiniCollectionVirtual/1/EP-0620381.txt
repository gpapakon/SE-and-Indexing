<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cord tightening device made of 
synthetic resin and used for tightening cords which are fitted 
on anoraks, rucksacks, life jackets, shopping bags, etc. for the 
purpose of tightening them. As a tightening device of this kind, the rope tightening 
device which comprises an angularly columnar hollow body formed 
of a top wall and a bottom wall separated parallelly from each 
other and opposed lateral walls and a movable arm device disposed 
inside the hollow body, the movable arm device being provided 
with four grip parts endowed with springiness and disposed as 
opposed to the lateral walls of the hollow body so as to allow 
insertion therebetween a rope or a cord bent in the shape of a 
loop and press the rope or cord against the lateral walls of the 
body thereby tightening it, and the rope tightening device 
further comprising a built-in release device capable of being 
manually operated to relieve the grip parts of the work of 
exerting pressure on the rope has been known (see Japanese Patent 
Publication No. SHO 57-42,552). As another cord tightening device of the kind under 
discussion, the cord tightening device which comprises a hollow 
body of a generally trapezoidal plan view and a slider, the  
 
hollow body being provided in the opposite end parts thereof with 
a small-width opening and a large-width opening and on a front 
plate thereof with a slide hole, and the slider being provided 
with a tightening part for tightening cord portions by pressing 
them against the lateral plates of the body and an operating part 
integral with the tightening part and protruding from the surface 
of the hollow body through the slide hole bored in the front 
plate is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. HEI 
2-46,731 and the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,034 issued 
Aug. 23, 1988 to Kasai. In this cord tightening device, the 
slider is provided with an aperture larger than the outer 
boundary of the operating part, and the operating part is 
resiliently cantilevered to the tightening part and normally 
overlying the aperture. The front plate is provided on the rear 
surface thereof at the large-width opening side of the body with 
a guide groove for guiding the operating part of the slider in 
the direction of the slide hole of the hollow body. Besides, the loop tie clasp which comprises a hollow body
