<ABSTRACT>
A microprozessor having a register bank architecture has 
n register banks (RF1 to RF4), a memory (606), a bus (208) for 

connecting the register bank and the memory, and a bank controller 
(BCU1) for controlling store/load operations banks and the 

memory. The controller has a current bank pointer indicating 
data region of the register banks and the memory during the data store/load 

operations, and a bank size designation register indicating a bank size to be 
stored/loaded during the store/load operations. When an address of the current 

bank pointer is set in an destination operand in an instruction, the controller 
receives the contents of the current bank pointer and bank size designation 

register. The controller controls the store operation for the n register banks 
based on the current bank pointer and the bank size designation register, and 

changes the content of the current bank pointer with the content of the 
destination operand in the instruction after the completion of the data store 

operation, receives the content of the current bank pointer and the content of 
the bank size designation register, and controls the load operation for the 

memory by the contents of the current bank pointer and bank size designation 
register.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a microprocessor having
a register bank architecture in which a built-in RAM and
general-purpose registers are connected through an
exclusive high-speed bus in order to that the contents
of the general-purpose registers agree with the contents
of the built-in RAM specified by a bank pointer, and, in
particular, to a microprocessor having a register bank
architecture wherein a wait time for execution of a
following instruction caused during the switching
operation of a bank in the register banks can be reduced
according to the preamble of claim 1. From EP-A-0 538 817 a processor is known having register bank means
comprising a plurality of register banks, namely exclusive-purpose registers and
general-purpose registers organized in four groups of four registers, a dedicated
bank memory RAM 2 for storing/loading the contents of one to five of said register
banks over a high-speed 64-bit exclusive-use data bus.
Bank control means for controlling said store/load operations includes a current
bank pointer CBP 4, a bank size field BS 32 included within a register PSW 8, said
BS 32 specifying a size of a bank presently in use, and an instruction CHGBK for
changing the content of CBP when switching task.
There is however no mention in EP-A-0 538 817 of associating flags to the
register banks.Further, IBM TECHNICAL DISCLOSURE BULLETIN. vol. 33, no. 3B, August
1990, NEW YORK, US, pages 472 - 473; "Technique to improve context switching
performance in a CPU" describes to use a reference register to keep track of
which general-purpose registers have been used during program execution, each
bit thereof corresponding to one of said general-purpose registers. Exploiting an
optimized compiler, a single instruction can then be used to save or restore only
the referenced general-purpose registers.
It must be noted, however, that the reference register described in this document
keeps track of which general-purpose registers have been used in the past, and
not of those registers that will be used in an upcoming task.Conventionally, in a conventional microprocessor having
a register bank architecture, a built-in RAM 126 and
general-purpose register group 127 are connected through
a exclusive high-speed bus 128 in order to that the
contents of the general-purpose register group 127 are
agreed with the contents of t he built-in RAM 126. In
the conventional microprocessor, contents of the
general-purpose register group 127 are stored and loaded
to/from the RAM 126 by setting a destination part
