<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inclusion compound or complex of a sodium or potassium salt a diclofenac
and a β-cyclodextrin.Diclofenac, also known as 2-[(2,6-dichlorophenyl)amino]benzeneacetic acid or
([o-2,6-dichloroanilino)phenyl] acetic acid, and its salts are well known antiinflammatory
agents.β-cyclodextrin is a cyclic compound consisting of seven units of α-(1→4)
linked D-gluco-pyranose units, and is used as a complexing agent.The properties of cyclodextrins and numerous inclusion complexes are well
known and have been reviewed in detail [see Szejtli, J. Cyclodextrin 
Technology (1988) Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht]. Briefly,
cyclodextrins are commercially available cyclic oligosaccharides composed of
6, 7 or 8 glucopyranose units (alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrin
respectively) characterized by a cone-like molecular shape. The cavity of the
cone is hydrophobic whilst the exterior is hydrophilic. The hydrophobic nature
of the cavity endows the molecule with the ability to form inclusion complexes
with hydrophobic guest molecules of suitable size to fit into the cavity of the
host. The inclusion complex may be stabilized by a number of forces including
van der Waals attractive forces and hydrogen bonding. Polar (ionized) groups
are less readily included than less-polar (unionized) groups.Cyclodextrin inclusion complexes may be prepared on the basis of liquid state,
solid state or semi-solid state reaction between the components. The former is
accomplished by dissolving the cyclodextrin and guest in a suitable solvent or
mixture of solvents and subsequently isolating the solid state complex by
crystallization, evaporation, spray drying or freeze drying. In the solid state
method, the two components may be screened to uniform particle size and
thoroughly mixed whereafter they are ground in a high energy mill with
optional heating, screened and homogenized. In the semi-solid state, the two
components are kneaded in the presence of small amounts of a suitable solvent,
and the complex so-formed, is oven dried, screened and homogenized. The
liquid state reaction generally provides optimum conditions for completeness of
reaction.Cyclodextrin inclusion complexation of a suitable guest results in a number of
physicochemical changes in the properties of the guest. Firstly, the melting
characteristics of the guest are absent in the cyclodextrin inclusion complex,
which generally begins to decompose without melting between 250 - 300 °C.
Secondly, the infrared spectrum and X-ray powder diffraction
