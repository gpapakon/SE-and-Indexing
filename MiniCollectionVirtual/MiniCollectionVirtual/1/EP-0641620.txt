<ABSTRACT>
A threading tap comprises a cylindrical shaft and a 
threading portion (2). At least the threading portion 

consists of a compound material comprising a core of high 
speed steel or tool steel and a cover of "Coronite" 

(registered trademark), i.e., a hard material with 30 to 
70% by volume of submicronic hard materials in the form of 

carbides, nitrides and/or carbonitrides of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, 
Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo and/or W in a metallic matrix based on Fe, 

Co and/or Ni. The chip surfaces (13) adjacent to the 
cutting edges (12) of the cutting threads (9) have a 

negative rake angle (α). The threading tap has proven to be 
excellent at the threading of titanium-based alloys.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a threading tap
for cutting threads in primarily titanium and titanium-based
metal alloys, comprising an elongate shaft of a
metallic compound material, which within a certain distance
from its one end is provided with two or more lands
preferably extending helically around the central axis of
the tap, which lands on their envelope surfaces are
provided with cutting threads of similar profile and which
are separated by equally helically twisted chip flutes.Threads are produced by chip-cutting or plastic
forming methods. Threading by threading taps belongs to the
chip-cutting methods. One may use either ready taps or
series taps, depending upon the hardness and cutting data
of the workpiece. Using ready taps, the thread is made by
one single tap while using series taps, several taps are
used in sequence for obtaining a ready thread.Threading taps are normally made of high speed
steel. In order to improve their function, these have
sometimes been subjected to some sort of surface treatment.
The most common surface treatments are steam tempering,
nitration and coating with TiN. These treatments contribute
to the counteracting of built-up edges, the increasing of
surface hardness and wear strength and to lowering the
friction. In spite of this, it has often turned out to be
difficult to attain perfectly satisfactory in some
difficult to machine materials. In particular in tough
materials, such as titanium and titanium-based alloys, the
usual threading taps of HSS have demonstrated
insatisfactory tool lives. Also the quality of the thread
has often been inadequate, which in first hand is caused by
portions of the relatively tough material being stuck upon
the threading tap, in particular at low cutting speeds.
Such inconveniences are of course particularly aggravating
in technical fields with so strict safety requirements as
the aircraft industry. The closest prior art document GB-A-2 174 031 discloses a threading
tap according to the preamble of claim 1, which has a negative rake
angle of -5°. However, it does not mention the use of "Coronite" (registered trademark).Thus, a first object of the present invention is 
to provide a threading tap with an increased tool life in
tough materials, such as titanium-based alloys, in
comparison with previous threading taps.A second object of the present invention is to
provide a threading tap which makes possible an efficacious
threading without any material being stuck on the tap also
at low cutting speeds.Another object of the present

<CLAIMS>
A threading tap consisting of an elongate,
substantially cylindrical shaft (1), which within a certain

distance from one of its ends is provided with two or more
lands (8) which are straight or helically twisted around

the central axis (7) of the threading tap, which lands are
provided with cutting threads (9) of substantially equal

profiles on their envelope surfaces and which are separated
by straight or equally twisted chip-conveying flutes (6),

the chip surfaces (13) adjacent to the cutting edges (12)
of the cutting threads (9) having a negative rake angle

(α), 
characterized
 in that at least the
portion of the threading tap being provided with lands (8)

consists of a core of high speed steel or tool steel and a
cover of a hard material with 30 to 70% by volume of

submicronic hard materials in the form of carbides,
nitrides and/or carbonitrides of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr,

Mo and/or W in a metallic matrix based on Fe, Co and/or Ni,
and in that said rake angle (α) is between -6 and -12°.
