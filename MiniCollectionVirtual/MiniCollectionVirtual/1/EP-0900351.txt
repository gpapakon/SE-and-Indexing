<ABSTRACT>
A gas turbine combustion chamber comprises pilot burners (26a) and main burners (26b), the latter being switched off when the fuel supply is interrupted. In particular to prevent problems during the transition from the mode in which the pilot burners are operating alone to the mode in which both the pilot burners and the main burners are operating, the main burners can be operated with pulsed fuel injection. By varying in a specific manner the pulsation frequency and the amount of fuel introduced with each injection pulse, the main burners can each be operated with the most favourable air-fuel ratio over a wide operating range. The invention further concerns a particularly advantageous pulse-metering device for producing this pulsed fuel injection.

<CLAIMS>
Method for fuel injection into a staged gas-turbine combustion chamber
with separate fuel injectors for each stage, where at least one is deactivatable

for certain operating conditions by interruption of the fuel supply,

characterized in that
 at least the deactivatable stage is operable with
pulsed fuel injection.
Method in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pulsation
frequency of the discontinuous fuel injection is variable.
Method in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the fuel
quantity deliverable with each injection pulse is variable. 
Method in accordance with one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 a switch-over can be made from discontinuous, pulsed fuel injection
to continuous fuel injection.
Fuel injection device for implementation of the method in accordance
with one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 an electromagnetically
and/or hydraulically operated fuel injector is used whose

opening time and opening duration can be positively set.
Fuel injection device for implementation of the method in accordance
with one of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a pulsation control
valve and/or a metering valve is arranged upstream of the fuel injector

extending into the combustion chamber.
Fuel injection device in accordance with Claim 6, 
characterized in that

the pulsation control valve and the metering valve are combined into one
unit referred to as pulsing-metering unit.
Fuel injection device in accordance with Claim 7, 
characterized in that

the pulsing-metering unit features a control piston (2) which is rotatable in
a cylinder (1) and which is movable in the direction of the cylinder axis

(3), with the outer wall of the control piston (2) featuring a control slit (7)
connecting to the piston interior (6) and with the piston interior (6) 

connecting to the fuel supply system of the combustion chamber, said
control slit (7) being settable coincidentally with a control window (5) in

the cylinder (1) which also connects to the fuel supply system.
Fuel injection device in accordance with Claim 8 
characterized by
 at least
one of the following features:


the rotation of the control piston (2) is effected by an electric motor or
by the gearbox of the gas turbine,
the control piston (2) is positioned in the direction of the cylinder axis
(3) by hydraulic pressure applied to a least one of its faces (12, 12').
