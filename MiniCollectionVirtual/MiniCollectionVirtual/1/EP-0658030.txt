<ABSTRACT>
A folding type portable radio transceiver having a 
hinge portion comprises radio circuit elements including 

a power amplifier which generates a large amount of heat 
are arranged in a lower casing which does not include a 

receiver. With this construction, uncomfortable feeling 
of a user due to heat transmitted to an ear of the user is 

restricted. Further, a display portion is also included 
in the lower casing and the transmitter in an upper casing 

is electrically connected to a control circuit board in 
the lower casing through a cable. Therefore, weight of 

the transceiver is concentrated to the lower casing and 
a stable holding of the lower casing becomes possible.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable transceiver
and, particularly, to a folding type portable transceiver.Because of the fact that a receiver (speaker) and a
transmitter (microphone) of the portable transceiver must correspond
in position to the ear and mouth of a user, respectively, the size of
the portable transceiver when in use is relatively large.In order to solve this problem, a folding type
portable transceiver has been popularized generally.The portable transceiver of this type is constituted
with an upper casing and a lower casing which are hinged
foldingly.When there is a communication therethrough, the these
casings are opened with respect to each other about the
hinge portion and, when it is not used, they are closed
to improve the portability thereof.A construction of an example of a folding type portable
transceiver of this kind is disclosed in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open Showa 63-129755, publicated on June 2,
1988.The portable transceiver disclosed in the above
article is made foldable by dividing a communication unit 
to two blocks contained in an upper casing and a lower casing,
respectively.Since, in the prior art portable transceiver mentioned
above, however, a radio circuit board on which radio circuit
parts including a power amplifier are mounted and which
generate a large amount of heat is provided in the upper
casing, there is a problem that heat generated thereby is
conducted to the ear of a user through a receiver included in
the upper casing during communication, causing discomfort to
the user.Further, the upper casing includes the radio circuit
board, a display and the receiver, and the lower casing
includes a battery, a key-operating portion, a control circuit
board for controlling the radio circuit board, the display and
the key-operating portion and a transmitter. Weights of the
casings are made balanced such that a user can hold either one
of the casings during communication. It brings about another
problem, i.e., when the user holds the upper casing, he has to
switch the casing to be held from the upper casing to the lower
casing in order to operate keys of the key-operating portion
included in the lower casing.French Patent Application FR-A-2 601 211 of Mecelec SA discloses a
portable telephone having an upper casing hinged to a lower
casing. The upper casing has a battery compartment, while the
lower compartment houses circuitry. Because of the heavy upper
casing, the telephone of this reference may not be stable for
a person operating the keyboard 13
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A folding-type portable transceiver comprising:

an upper casing (1a), including a receiver (2) for
receiving radio signals and also including a display portion;
a lower casing (1b) including a transmitter (4) for
transmitting a radio signal;
a hinge portion (1c) for coupling said upper casing (1a)
and said lower casing (1b) ;
characterised in that
, in said lower casing, are arranged at
least a radio circuit board (5), a control circuit board (10)

for controlling said radio circuit board (5), a battery (8),
and, comprised in radio circuit board (5), a radio circuit

part (6) generating a substantial amount of heat during transmission,
unfolding of the upper casing (1a) and lower casing

(1b) during use of the transceiver preventing the substantial
amount of heat generated by the radio circuit part (6) from

reaching the upper casing (1a), the weight of the lower casing
and its contents being substantially greater than the weight

of the upper casing and its contents.
The folding-type portable transceiver claimed in
claim 1, further 
characterised in that
 said radio circuit part
(6) includes a power amplifier.
The folding-type portable transceiver claimed in
claim 1 or 2, wherein the transceiver is a cellular telephone.
