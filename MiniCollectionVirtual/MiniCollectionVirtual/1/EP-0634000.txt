<ABSTRACT>
A blood sampling device has a tubular body (1, 2) housing a spring loaded (7) lancet (8) whose needle (17) is initially protected by a cap (20) which projects out from the forward end of the body. A rocker-like trigger (9) is formed as part of the moulded body (1, 2) and holds the lancet (8) in a retracted position when the lancet is pushed back by the projecting cap (20). The cap can then be removed by a twist and pull action, breaking it free from the lancet body, which is prevented from rotating. Pressure on the trigger (9) releases the lancet (8), which is shot forward by the spring (7) for momentary projection of the needle tip (19), and then retracts to bring the needle tip within the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blood sampling devices, 
and in particular to a pricker to draw a small drop of blood 
for analysis. Such prickers are widely used by diabetics, 
for example, who need to know their sugar level. However, 
there are many other applications. These days, with AIDS, there is widespread concern 
surrounding the use of needles and their part in transmitting 
disease. Once a needle has been used on an infected 
person, subsequent use or an accidental prick on another 
could be fatal. There is therefore a growing demand for a pricker 
which can be used just once and, having been used, is 
automatically rendered safe for carriage and disposal. Several such prickers have been proposed, for 
example in EP-A-0427406 and EP-A-0433050. These work well, 
and use a lancet which has been in production for many 
years. However, it is important for disposable objects with 
a very transient life to be made as simply and cheaply as 
possible, without compromising on effectiveness. This the 
present invention aims to do. According to the present invention there is 
provided a disposable pricker comprising an elongate body 
with a spring-loaded lancet carried therein, the lancet tip 
normally being within the body, a trigger mechanism to 
retain the lancet in a fully retracted position energising 
the spring means and actuable to release the lancet to cause  
 
the tip to have a momentary position projecting from the 
forward end of the body, and a cap initially encasing the 
lancet tip and having a head external of the body, 
characterised in that the cap is elongate, provides the sole 
means of retracting the lancet, and is breakable free of the 
lancet by twisting when so retracted to leave the tip 
exposed, the lancet having an engagement with the interior 
of the body, preventing it rotating about its longitudinal 
axis at least when the lancet is retracted. Preferably the trigger mechanism is formed 
integrally with the body, which will generally be moulded in 
plastics material with a certain resilience. The trigger 
mechanism conveniently comprises a rocker with an outstanding 
projecting portion for manual operation and an inwardly 
projecting portion for co-operation with the lancet. The 
rocker may be centrally connected to the main part of the 
body by webs which are distortable to allow the rocker 
action. It has been found beneficial for the rocker to 
have further means connecting it to the body to resist 
pivoting below a predetermined actuating force. This 
prevents accidental

<CLAIMS>
A disposable pricker comprising an elongate 
body (1,2) with a spring-loaded lancet (8) carried therein, 

the lancet tip (17) normally being within the body, a 
trigger mechanism (9) to retain the lancet (8) in a fully 

retracted position energizing the spring means (7) and 
actuable to release the lancet (8) to cause the tip (17) to 

have a momentary position projecting from the forward end of 
the body (1,2), and a cap (20) initially encasing the lancet 

tip (17) and having a head (22) external of the body (1,2), 
characterised in that the cap (20) is elongate, provides the 

sole means of retracting the lancet (8), and is breakable 
free of the lancet (8) by twisting when so retracted to 

leave the tip (17) exposed, the lancet (8) having an 
engagement with the interior of the body (1,2) preventing it 

rotating about its longitudinal axis at least when the 
lancet (8) is retracted. 
A disposable pricker as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the trigger mechanism (9) is formed 

integrally with the body (1), which is of moulded plastics 
material, and comprises a rocker with an outstanding 

projecting portion (13) for manual operation and an inwardly 
projecting portion (12) for co-operation with the lancet 

(8). 
A disposable pricker as claimed in Claim 2, 
characterised in that the rocker is centrally connected to 

the main part (1) of the body by webs (11) which are 
distortable to allow the rocker action.  

 
A disposable pricker as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that the rocker (9) has further means (14) 

connecting it to the body to resist pivoting below a 
predetermined actuating force but once that force has been 

exceeded to offer little further resistance. 
A disposable pricker as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the lancet (8) has a detent 

(23) and the trigger (9) has a co-operative lug (12), 
projecting inwardly with respect to the body (1,2), the 

detent (23) being arranged to snap past the lug (12) as the 
lancet (8) is retracted and to hold the lancet in that 

position. 
A disposable pricker as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the body is moulded in two 

parts (1,2) connected by a thin flexible web, presenting the 
body in an opened out condition but closeable together when 

the lancet (8) and spring means (7) are in place. 
A disposable pricker as claimed in any preceding 
claim, characterised in that the fit of the lancet (8) 

within the body (1,2) is such that, once the lancet has been 
fired, it will lie skew to the axis of the body.
