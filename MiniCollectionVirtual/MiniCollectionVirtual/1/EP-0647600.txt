<ABSTRACT>
The high-purity, opaque quartz glass containing 3 x 
10⁶ - 9 x 10⁶ of closed cells having an average size of 20-40 µm 

per 1 cm³, a ratio of closed cells having sizes of 100 µm or more 
to the whole of cells being 1% or less, thereby showing 5% or less 

of linear transmittance for near infrared rays (λ=900 nm) at a 
thickness of 1 mm is produced by compacting amorphous silica 

powder having an average particle size of 0.5-10 µm, in which 
each of impurities selected from Li, Na, K, Fe, Ti and Al is 1 ppm or 

less, if any, and sintering the resultant green body at 1730-1850°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-purity, opaque
quartz glass having an excellent capability of intercepting heat
rays, and a method for producing such a high-purity, opaque
quartz glass. Further, it relates to a flange and a tube made of
such a high-purity, opaque quartz glass, and methods for
producing them.Because of high capability of intercepting heat rays, an
opaque quartz glass has been widely used hitherto for furnace
tubes and flanges for use in the production of semiconductors, etc.
Since heat rays reflect on a surface of each cell contained in the
opaque quartz glass, the dimension of the cell contained in the
opaque quartz glass has a large influence on the capability of
intercepting heat rays.Most opaque quartz glass presently used contains
closed cells having an average size of more than 50 µm in a
proportion of 1 x 106 or less per 1 cm3, more specifically 1 x 104-1
x 105 per 1 cm3, many of the closed cells having sizes of 100 µm
or more. Some opaque quartz glass contains closed cells having an
average size of 50 µm or less, but the number of the closed cells
is 1 x 106 or less per 1 cm3. Therefore, the whole surface area of
the closed cells is inevitably as small as less than 50 cm2 per 1
cm3 in such opaque quartz glass, resulting in a limited capability of
intercepting heat rays. The capability of intercepting heat rays has a close
relation to transmittance of light, particularly for near infrared
rays. Generally, the lower the transmittance for near infrared
rays, the higher the capability of intercepting heat rays. Presently
used opaque quartz glass has 10-50% of transmittance for near
infrared rays (λ=900 nm) at a thickness of 3 mm, and presumably
30-60% at a thickness of 1 mm. These transmittance levels are
too high to sufficiently intercept heat rays.A opaque quartz glass is conventionally produced by
melting natural materials such as silica and quartz in an electric
furnace, or by melting the natural materials together with blowing
agents such as CaCO3. Since the opaque quartz glass thus produced
contains impurities such as alkali substances, it is difficult to use
the resulting glass as materials for parts for use in the production
of semiconductors, etc.Conventional opaque quartz glass produced from
natural materials and blowing agents contains over 1 ppm of
impurities such as Na and Fe. In addition, since a conventional
opaque quartz glass flange, for instance, is produced by forming a
bulk of opaque quartz glass and machining the bulk into a
predetermined shape, large
