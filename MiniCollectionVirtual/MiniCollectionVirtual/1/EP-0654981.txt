<ABSTRACT>
The Anti Bruxism Device is a device that stops or at least diminishes bruxism. Bruxism is a non-physiological parafunction that could damage teeth and molars, and affects the neuro-muscular system in a negative way. It could cause for example headaches, migraine like complaints, etc. To stop bruxism, our device uses a biofeedback system which detects (pathological) bruxism and stops it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a device for preventing bruxism. Bruxism is a 
conscious or subconscious parafunction that takes place during the day and/or at night, 
and consists of a static and/or dynamic contact between the chewinglevels of the 
mandibular and upper jaw. Herewith appears an avowed neuro-muscular activity. These contacts are not physiological. Bruxism, also known as teeth-grinding or teeth-jamming, has two 
consequences concerning ones health. First it damages the teeth and molars, and secondly it influences the 
neuro-muscular system negatively (muscle spasms, arthrosis, etc.) The object is to develop a device that stops bruxism and prevents its 
injurious effects. The device for preventing bruxism of the present invention is set out in 
claim 1, with the features known from US-A-4995404 in the preamble. The device consists of an already used splint (synthetic resin) as carrier 
for a special biofeedback system. A splint is a synthetic resin modelled plate most frequently worn on the 
teeth of the upper jaw. The biofeedback system detects bruxism, transponds a signal which 
diminishes, and finally stops bruxism. This device can also be used for preventive 
means; that is to say with patients grinding their teeth who don't yet suffer the 
consequences. The device features a biofeedback system with at least one 
pressure sensor, connected to a transponding element (e.g. a chip), which is connected 
to a pulse generator. This generator transmits a, preferably, electrical impulse to a conducting 
splint anchor. In this example the splint is worn on the palate of the mouth, in which the 
pressure sensors (in the synthetic resin) are extended over the upper jaw teeth.  
 When bruxism occurs, the pressure sensor measures the pressure force 
between teeth and/or molars signals the transponding unit, in case the pressure force 
reaches a previous adjusted value or time, and another signal is given to the pulse 
generator in a way an (e.g.) electrical impulse irritates the molar region via the anchor. By this, the patient receives a stimulation through which the bruxism stops 
(reflex activity). 
If worn, during the sleep, this sleep may not be interrupted. The diagram shows a simple drawn example of a Anti Bruxism Device.

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for preventing bruxism having a splint (2) containing a 
biofeedback system, the biofeedback system being integrated with at least one pressure 

sensor (5, 5') engaged to a pressure registration element (7) and having a battery 
characterized in that, the splint (2) being provided with splint anchors (3, 3') made from 

orthodontic metal which can conduct electrical pulses and the pressure registration 
element (7) gives a signal to a pulse generator (9) to send pulses to the said splint 

anchors (3, 3') which stops bruxism activity and maintains normal physiology.
