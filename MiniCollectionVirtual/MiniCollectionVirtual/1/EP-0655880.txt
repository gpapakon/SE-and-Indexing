<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a circuit arrangement for operating a low-pressure discharge lamp (L) at a low-voltage source. It operates in accordance with the principle of the single-ended flyback converter and has, in the direction of the lamp (L), two diodes (D1, D2), the diode (D2) serving to preheat the lamp electrode (E2). The diode (D1) is connected between the secondary winding (N2) of the transformer and the lamp electrode (E1), and the other diode (D2) is connected between the primary winding (N1) and the lamp electrode (E2). An additional capacitor (C4) improves the starting of the lamp.
