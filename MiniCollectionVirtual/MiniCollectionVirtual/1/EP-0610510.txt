<ABSTRACT>
A method of radial forging of a blank where the blank (1) is placed in the manipulator head (2), swaged by at least two 
pairs of oppositely mounted pressing block-heads (3, 4 and 5, 6), while applying at the same time the normal swaging force of 

the said pairs of the pressing block-heads and a shearing force T, then is moved along the longitudinal axis 00 or turned about 
the lon
gitudinal axis 00 and is moved along the same longitudinal axis 00, the operation of swaging the blank (1) being 
carried out simultaneously at its two sections A and B situated consecutively along its longitudinal axis 00, the shearing 

force T being applied at these sections in opposite directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the area of mechanical metal-working and deals, in particular,
with the method of manufacturing long forgings from ingots and continuous cast billets. Applying the method of the present invention, a blank is mounted
into a clamping head of at least one manipulator and swaged at
least by two pairs of oppositely arranged faces, there being
applied in the process forces of normal linear reduction which
are created by said pairs of faces, and, at the same time, a
shearing force. Thereafter the blank is displaced along the longitudinal
axis, before the indicated displacement, is rotated
along the longitudinal axis, after which the entire process of
processing the blank is repeated until the given geometrical dimensions
of the forging are obtained. This method can be used in machine building and metallurgy for manufacturing long
products like rods, columns, shafts and so on; manufacturing pre-forged intermediate products
from special, stainless, heat-resistant and hard-wrought alloys to be later worked mechanically
into rods; pre-forging of job workpieces from the above mentioned alloys for subsequent
mechanical dividing into uniform parts and also for forging conventionally cast ingots and
continuous cast billets into deformed ones.There's known a method of radial forging of ingots and continuous cast billets with the help
of radial forging machine (see, for instance, an advertisement leaflet of "SMS" company "Radial
forging machine. Advanced extension and forging technology". P'/327. SMS Hasenklever,
3000/4/90 Sch.). By this method the initial blank is heated first, then it is set up into the chuck
head of manipulator and after that fed into the interspace of the forming tools, being
simultaneously rotated for producing forgings of round cross-sections while without rotation
forgings of square or rectangular cross-sections are obtained. The blank is swayed at the same
part along its length in the working zone, in turn by each pair of forging tools moving radially in
one plane to the blank's axis. During the intervals between swagings, when the forging tools
accomplish their back travel, the blank is moved in the axial direction, when forgings of square
and rectangular cross-sections should be obtained, or the blank is rotated around its longitudinal
axis and moved lengthwise when forgings of round cross-sections should be obtained. The
mentioned above operational cycle is repeated over and over reducing the blank to the required
sizes. The considered forging method makes it

<CLAIMS>
Method for the radial forging of a blank, consisting in
that the blank (1) is mounted in a clamping head (2) of at least

one manipulator and swaged at least by two pairs of oppositely
arranged faces (3, 4), there being applied in the process forces

(P) of normal linear reduction which are created by the said
pairs of faces, and, at the same time, a shearing force (T);

thereafter the blank (1) is displaced along the longitudinal
axis or, before the indicated displacement, is rotated around

the longitudinal axis, after which the entire process of processing
the blank (1) is repeated until the given geometrical dimensions

of the forging are obtained, characterized in that the
shearing forces are created simultaneously at least on two successive

sections (A) and (B) by means of linear reduction of the
blank (1) by two pairs of faces (3, 4; 5, 6) performing displacement

in opposite directions correspondingly over arcs of
circles (C, C') with centres on the longitudinal axis of the

blank (1) and during the performance of the two pairs of faces a
shearing force is additionally created by rotating the blank (1)

around its longitudinal axis by means of the clamping head (2)
at least of one manipulator, the said shearing force being commensurate

with the force (P) of normal linear reduction by the
faces and coinciding with the direction of the shearing force

(T) on the adjacent section.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the linear
reduction of the blank (1) on each section (A, B) is performed

by one of the pairs of faces (3, 4; 5, 6), forces being
applied on opposite directions and the pairs of faces being selected

in an unlike fashion, and then by the other pairs of
faces accompanied by a change in the direction of application of

the forces, there being a simultaneous change in the direction
of rotation of the clamping head (2) of the manipulator.
