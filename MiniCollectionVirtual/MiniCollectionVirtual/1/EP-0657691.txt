<ABSTRACT>
A mixing diffuser element is disclosed which 
comprises a flattened box-type body (11') having an 

apertured edge for the outflow of air/gas 
mixture, and a conduit (10') connected to the body for 

the intake and mixing of air and gas within the 
box-type body. 
To reduce space requirements while ensuring 
excellent uniformity for the outflow of air/gas 

mixture, the box-type body (11') is formed, near its 
apertured edge, with a throat (20) whose breadth 

varies inversely with the local velocity of the air/gas 
mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gas burners 
of the atmospheric type, and in particular, to a mixing 
diffuser element for such a burner. Known is a mixing diffuser element which 
comprises a flattened box-type body having an apertured 
edge, and a venturi conduit which connects to the 
box-type body. An element of this kind is shown in 
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings. A gaseous fuel 
issuing from a respective nozzle, not shown, is drawn 
into the venturi, shown at 10 in the drawing, and 
admixed to air, and the resultant mixture is caused to 
flow, while undergoing expansion, through the box-type 
body, shown at 11, whence it comes out through openings 
12 in a U-shaped section member 13 which defines one 
edge of the box-type body. Once ignited, the mixture 
burns in an array of flames which issue from the 
openings 12. A number of such elements can be mounted 
side-by-side in a respective supporting structure to 
form a burner having a desired thermal rating. A 
typical application of a burner of this kind is in the 
supply of heat to a heat exchanger for small to medium 
size boilers. In order for the combustion to be complete  
 
and the flames of the same height all along the edge of 
the mixing diffuser element, it is necessary that the 
flow rate of the outgoing mixture be substantially the 
same through all of the openings. To achieve this, the 
box-type body should have a height dimension, as 
measured in a perpendicular direction to the edge with 
the mixture outlet openings, which is not below a value 
set by the structural characteristics of the body and 
the venturi, by the size of the openings, the pressure 
of the gas jet, etc.. It is indeed necessary to allow 
the mixture flow, which is being admitted to the 
venturi in a limited area of the body at a given 
pressure and along a given direction, to spread out all 
along the box-type body length and attain a steady 
state, to ultimately leave all the openings at one and 
the same flow rate. In many applications, such as in wall-mounted 
boilers, it is desirable that the burner volume be 
minimized. The object of the present invention is to 
provide a mixing diffuser element for a burner of the 
atmospheric type, which has reduced space requirements, 
while ensuring excellent outflow uniformity for the 
air/gas mixture which issues from its openings. This object is achieved, according to the  
 
invention, by that the box-type body is formed, near 
its apertured edge, with a throat whose breadth varies 
inversely with the local

<CLAIMS>
A mixing diffuser element for a gas burner 
of the atmospheric type, comprising 

   a flattened box-type body (11') having an 
apertured edge (12') for the outflow of air/gas 

mixture, and 
   a conduit (10') for the intake and mixing of 

air and gas within the box-type body, which connects to 
the box-type body, 

characterized in that the box-type body (11') is 
formed, near its apertured (12') edge, with a throat 

(20) whose breadth varies inversely with the local 
velocity of the air/gas mixture. 
An element according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the apertured edge (13') is 

substantially rectilinear, that the conduit (10') 
connects to the box-type body in an opposite area 

thereof from the edge and its axis forms with the edge 
an acute angle whose apex lies close to one end of the 

edge, and that the breadth of the throat (20) varies 
gradually from a minimum at said end to a maximum at 

the opposite end of the edge. 
An element according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the apertured edge (13'') is 

substantially rectilinear and that the conduit (10'') 
 

connects to the box-type body (11'') in an opposite 
area thereof from the central portion of the edge 

(13'') and its axis forms with the edge substantially a 

right angle, and that the breadth of the throat (20') 
varies gradually from a minimum at said central portion 

to a maximum at either ends of the edge (13'). 
An element according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the box-type 

body (11') and the conduit (10') are formed in one 
piece from dimpled sheet metal folded over into two 

juxtaposed half-shells interconnected by said apertured 
(12') edge and joined to each other along part of their 

respective edges (14,15) to leave the conduit (10') 
inlet uncovered. 
An element according to any of Claims 1 to

the conduit are formed essentially by two half-shells 
of dimpled sheet metal which are joined to each other 

along part of their respective edges (14,15) to leave 
one side of the body (11') and the conduit (10') inlet 

uncovered, and that the apertured (12') edge is formed 
by a U-shaped section member (13') joined to the two 

half-shells at the uncovered side of the body. 
An element according to Claims 4 or 5,

half-shells are joined together by clinching. 
An element according to either Claim 4 or
