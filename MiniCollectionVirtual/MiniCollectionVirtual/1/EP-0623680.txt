<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The enzymatic synthesis of peptides takes place advantageously using proteases although the hydrolysis, associated with the formation of the peptide product, of the acyl-enzyme intermediate and further possible proteolytic cleavages represent a problem in many synthetic reactions. The yield of peptide product is limited thereby, and the removal of by-products is impeded. The new biocatalytic peptide preparation is intended to take place with exclusion as far as possible of unwanted proteolytic side reactions. 2.2 The biocatalytic preparation of a peptide takes place advantageously by using a zymogen in place of the protease customarily used. Since zymogens are protease precursors which are still without proteolytic activity, there is substantial suppression of proteolytic side reactions. Amino acid esters or peptide esters and amino acids or peptide fragments with C-terminal derivatisation are preferably coupled together. The reaction can also take place in a frozen aqueous medium. Particularly suitable zymogens are chymotrypsinogen, trypsinogen, pepsinogen, prorennin or procarboxypeptidase. 2.3 Enzymatic or biocatalysed peptide synthesis.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the biocatalytic production of a peptide
from an amino acid ester or a peptide ester and a

C-terminally derivatised amino acid or a peptide
fragment,

characterised in that

a zymogen is used as the biocatalyst.
Process according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the peptide is synthesised from substrates by means of
a zymogen, which is selected such that the rate of

peptide degradation by the enzyme corresponding to the
zymogen is at least one order of magnitude slower than

the rate of linkage of the selected substrates.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

the reaction is performed in an aqueous medium, which
may contain fractions of organic solvent.
Process according to claim 3,

characterised in that

the reaction is performed in a frozen aqueous medium.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

chymotrypsinogen, trypsinogen, pepsinogen, prorennin
or procarboxypeptidase is used as the zymogen.
Use of a zymogen for peptide synthesis.
