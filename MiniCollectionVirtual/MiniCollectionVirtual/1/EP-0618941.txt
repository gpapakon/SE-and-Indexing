<DESCRIPTION>
 FLOOR COVERINGSField of the inventionThis invention relates to vinyl floor coverings with improved anti-slip characteristics, stain resistance and scratch resistance, particularly to such coverings in sheet or tile form and especially to flexible floor coverings and to floor coverings which have a clear wear layer.Background of the inventionVinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings are well- known and have enjoyed considerable commercial success. They are based on homopolymers or copolymers of vinyl chloride, for example vinyl chloride/vinyl acetate copolymers. The homopolymers and the copolymers are both commonly referred to as PVC resins or PVC polymers. Compositions which comprise PVC resin are commonly referred to as PVC compositions or simply as PVC. The amounts of the various components in a PVC composition are commonly expressed either as percentages by weight on the whole composition or as parts per hundred by weight of PVC resin (phr) . PVC compositions which contain little or no plasticiser (for example up to about 2% by weight) are relatively rigid and brittle, and they are commonly referred to as rigid PVC, unplasticised PVC or UPVC. PVC compositions which contain relatively large amounts of plasticiser (for example around 10-40% by weight or 10 to 50 phr) are more flexible and have a lower modulus, and they are commonly referred to as flexible PVC, plasticised PVC or PPVC. The plasticiser mayÂ¬ be a simple ester plasticiser, also known as a monomeric plasticiser. Rigid and flexible PVC have significantly different properties, technology and end-uses. Vinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings are based on flexible PVC.PVC Technology, ed. W.V. Titow, Elsevier Applied Science Publishers, 4th Edition (1984), describes the 

 manufacture, properties and uses of PVC. It uses the same terminology as that defined above. An article entitled "Vinyl Chloride Polymers" in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, iley-Interscience, 3rd Edition, 5 Supplement Volume (1989), pages 822-889, also describes the manufacture, properties and uses of PVC. An article entitled "Flooring Materials" in Encyclopaedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, Wiley-Interscience, 3rd edition, Volume 7 (1987), pages 233-247, describes the manufacture and uses of vinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings. Vinyl sheet and vinyl tile floor coverings are usually composite materials constructed from a number of layers, each layer being specially formulated for a particular duty. The layers are generally films which are
