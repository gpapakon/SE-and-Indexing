<ABSTRACT>
Water soluble polymeric conjugates of camptothecin comprise N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacryloylamide units linked via a spacer of the formula -Gly-(CH2)n-CO-Gly wherein n = 2-8 to the C-20 position of a camptothecin residue. The conjugates possess enhanced antitumor activity and decreased toxicity with respect to the free drug. A process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to polymeric conjugates of 20-O-[glycyl-aminoacyl-glycyl]
camptothecins. Our WO-95/10304 describes and claims conjugates of camptothecins
linked to a polymer through a peptidyl spacer. We have now found that the conjugates in
which the spacer is a glycyl-aminoacyl-glycyl are of exceptional value as antitumor agent
and are endowed with remarkable antitumor activity and reduced toxicity in comparison
with the free drug.Particularly the present invention provides polymeric conjugates of the formula (1)
consisting of:
(i) from 85 to 97 mol % of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacryloylamide units represented
by formula (3)

units represented by formula (4).
