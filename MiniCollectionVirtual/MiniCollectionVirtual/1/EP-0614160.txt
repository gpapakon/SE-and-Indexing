<ABSTRACT>
The operation and control of devices is to be made possible by means of a portable component. Operation and control of devices, especially telephone devices, by means of speech, by means of a portable speech module. Portable speech module on which there are a digital signal processor (DSP), a memory (S), an analog-digital/digital-analog convertor (AD/DA), an analog interface (ANALOG I/O), a computer interface (PORT) and a digital interface (DIGITAL I/O). A telephone device consists of the portable speech module and of a telephone which is composed of its basic components and interfaces.

<CLAIMS>
Telephone installation consisting of

a portable voice module for the voice-controlled operation of the telephone
installation with a digital signal processor (DSP), with an analog-digital/digital-analog

converter (AD/DA), with an analog interface
(ANALOG I/O) for voice input, with a digital interface (DIGITAL I/O) and

with a memory (S) in which software programs of service features and
software programs for voice encoding and voice recognition are stored,

wherein the digital signal processor (DSP) is connected to the memory (S)
as well as to the digital interface (DIGITAL I/O) and, through the analog-digital/digital-analog

converter (AD/DA), to the analog interface (ANALOG
I/O), and
a telephone device with a plug-in interface for the portable voice module
and with a microphone for voice input, wherein analog speech signals are

fed to the analog interface of the voice module when the voice module is
plugged in.
Telephone installation according to claim 1, in which spoken language is
stored in the portable voice module.
Telephone installation according to claim 1 or 2, in which software
programs stored in the voice module's memory are suitable for playing back

speech and/or for performing a hands-free telephone function.
Telephone installation according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which the
software programs stored in the voice module's memory are suitable for encoding

voice for user guidance.
Telephone installation according to one of claims 1 to 4, in which the 
telephone device is a public telephone or a private telephone or a mobile

telephone or a data processing device with telephone operating function.
Plug-in portable voice module for a telephone installation according to
claim 1, with


a digital signal processor (DSP),
an analog-digital/digital-analog converter (AD/DA),
an analog interface (ANALOG I/O) for voice input of analog voice signals
input via a microphone of the telephone device,
a digital interface (DIGITAL I/O) and
a memory (S) in which software programs of service features and software
programs for voice encoding and voice recognition are stored,

wherein the digital signal processor (DSP) is connected to the memory (S) as well
as to the digital interface (DIGITAL I/O) and, through the analog-digital/digital-analog

converter (AD/DA), to the analog interface (ANALOG I/O).
