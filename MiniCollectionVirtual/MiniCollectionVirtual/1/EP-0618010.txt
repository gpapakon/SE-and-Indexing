<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method and installation 
for separating materials. The invention is meant for separating waste materials, 
such as ferrous and nonferrous scrap and the like, for 
example scrap of computers, cars and also smaller waste, 
and for separating light and heavy shredder waste 
resulting from the processing of ferrous and nonferrous 
scrap in what are called shredder installations, also 
called hammer mills. Installations for processing scrap, in particular for 
separating reduced scrap, are already known in various 
forms. A disadvantage of the known embodiments consists 
in that the separation is little refined. Also, the present invention aims a method and 
installation for separating materials which provide a 
solution to the above-mentioned disadvantage. To this end, the invention relates to a method for 
separating materials, especially waste materials, 
characterized in that it subsequently provides for a 
magnetic separation; a separation by means of a sifting 
device; an aerodynamic separation by means of an air 
separator; and a separation by means of a separation 
process which mainly consists in putting the materials 
yet to be separated in a medium, in moving the medium, 
and in separately removing the floating and sinking  
 
components of the remaining material from the medium. This precise sequence of steps, with the intervention of 
other steps or not, allows an optimal separation of scrap 
with a minimal number of machines. As further a moving medium is used, it is possible to 
obtain a very precise separation in a very quick way, and 
a large series of mediums can be used, in particular with 
various densities, as a result of which different 
separation effects can be obtained. According to the invention, use is preferably made for 
the medium of a suspension, in other words a mixture of 
solid and liquid components, preferably sand and/or sandy 
clay in water, ferrosilicon and/or magnetite in water, 
depending on the required density. In order to obtain an optimum separation, it is 
preferred, according to the invention, to put the 
materials together with the medium in a receiver, where 
the materials are separated according to the their 
required density, whereby the movement in the medium is 
obtained by continuously supplying and discharging the 
medium from the receiver, such that there is a permanent 
flow in here, or by moving, for example turning the 
receiver, or better still through a combination of the 
two above-mentioned operations. The
