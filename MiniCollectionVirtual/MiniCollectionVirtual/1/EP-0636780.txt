<ABSTRACT>
A tubular component such as an exhaust shroud is provided for use in a noise 
suppression system for an aircraft jet engine, the tubular component 

providing an outlet passage for jet engine produced exhaust gases having 
turbo-machinery produced sound energy superimposed thereon, the tubular 

component having an outer structural shell (44) with a tubular axis (32) and 
an acoustic liner supported within the structural shell formed of a tubular 

honeycomb metallic core, the honeycomb core being formed of thin metallic 
strips joined into a welded honeycomb arrangement of contiguous hexagonal 

cells (30). Each of the cells (30) has a longitudinal axis extending 
perpendicular to the shell tubular axis, each shell being of depth of at 

least one inch and of a cross-sectional size from wall-to-wall of about 3/8 
to 1/2 inch.

<DESCRIPTION>
This disclosure relates to a tubular component, such as an exhaust shroud, formed 
as a part of a noise suppression system for an aircraft jet engine. The noise produced 
by a jet engine is composed basically of: (a) a broadband energy related to the jet 
exhaust velocity, and (b) a narrowband tone energy produced by the turbo-machinery of 
the jet engine itself. If an exhaust shroud extending aft of the engine can be made to 
absorb and dissipate the low frequency energy produced by the jet engine, then a 
significant portion of the overall noise produced by an aircraft jet engine can be 
eliminated. The use of a sound absorption material within an exhaust shroud is well known, 
as exemplified in the following United States Patents: 4,909,346 and 5,060,471. A typical method of providing sound absorption material is the use of a honeycomb 
panel. Any sound absorption material used in a jet engine noise suppression system 
must be capable of withstanding the high temperatures encountered in the engine 
exhaust and thus must be made of metal, the preferred metal being stainless steel. 
Stainless steel honeycomb panels are typically produced with a honeycomb core with a 
planar material covering one or both sides. When using such planar honeycomb panels 
it is necessary to carve them into arcuate portions to fit inside the usual tubular exhaust  
 
shroud. The problem is that this method produces unequal individual cell sizes and cell 
alignments as measured with reference to the exhaust shroud tubular axis. The use of honeycomb material that has irregular cell heights and cell alignments 
reduces the effectiveness of sound absorption. Absorption of a relatively low frequency 
band is required to effectively dissipate the sound energy tone produced by a jet engine. 
In other words, the sound absorption characteristics of previously used honeycomb 
sound absorption material has not maximized the noise reduction potential of a noise 
reduction system for use with a jet engine. A method of manufacturing honeycomb core material that can be used in provided 
honeycomb sound absorptive material to practice the invention of this disclosure is 
described in United States Patent 5,064,493 issued November 12, 1991. Patent 5,064,493 
is incorporated herein by reference.  This invention pertains to a tubular component, such as an exhaust shroud used 
in a system for noise abatement of a jet aircraft engine. More particularly, the invention 
relies to an exhaust shroud used in a jet engine noise suppression system that
