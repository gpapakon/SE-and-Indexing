<ABSTRACT>
A shielded tip catheter (10, 12) for use with a pulsed energy source (14) for fracturing deposits such as urinary and biliary stones and atherosclerotic plaque in the human body is disclosed. The flexible catheter (10) has a shielded tip structure (12) which is adapted for insertion through a fluid passage in a living body. The tip structure (12) can contain an impact element (30), a scraping implement (52) or a cutting implement (54). An energy source (14) creates repeated rapid vapor expansions adjacent the element (32) causing it (30) to undergo repeated pulse like movements, imparting a series of high-velocity impulses to an adjacent deposit, thereby fracturing or cutting it. The energy source (14) can be a laser with a fiber optic delivery system (24) in the catheter (10) terminating adjacent the impact element (30), or a spark generator (14) with a conductor (24) within the catheter (10) to deliver a fluid vaporizing spark (28) adjacent the element (30).

 SHIELDED TIP CATHETERRelated ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. application Serial No. 07/632,487, filed February 4, 1991, which is a continuation of U.S. Serial No. 07/314,472, filed February 22, 1989, now abandoned, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.Background of the InventionCalciferous and similar deposits occur in body fluid passages of various types, including kidney stones, gall stones, and arterial plaque. Surgery or radiation typically has been used for removing or destroying such deposits. In one form of laser therapy, radiation is directed onto a light-receiving surface of a heat- generating element. The element is then placed in contact with the target deposit, melting it. This approach has several drawbacks which include, for example, thermal damage to surrounding tissue, formation of char and debris from advanced fibrous and calcified plaques, and adhesion of the hot element to the tissue thereby rupturing it when the element is removed. In another approach, known as direct lasertripsy, laser radiation is applied directly to the target deposit to ablate it or produce shock waves that induce fragmentation. Direct lasertripsy also has several disadvantages. For example, laser energy often damages healthy tissue surrounding the target deposit by direct absorption or .by acting as a general heat sink for the 

 high temperature plasma. Some deposits only weakly absorb radiation which requires the use of higher levels of radiation and consequent tissue damage.Impact lithotripsy has been used for treating some hard deposits. For example, Pohlman et al. in U.S. Patent 3,927,675 describe a device for fragmenting hard deposits in the urinary tract using ultrasonic energy. This device has several drawbacks, including the use of a thick spiral metal probe within the catheter, and it requires that ultrasonic energy be transmitted the length of the catheter which causes vibration along the length of the catheter. In U.S. Patent 3,823,717, Pohlman et al. describe another ultrasonic device having an implement with a cutting edge attached to the end of the catheter. This device suffers all the drawbacks of the otherPohlman device with the additional disadvantage that the cutting edge appears to be exposed, which could damage surrounding tissues.Oinuma et al. in U.S. Patent 4,605,003 describe a lithotripter which utilizes a gas-generating explosive to drive an impact element against a stone in a body. This device is capable of
