<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to β-mercapto-propanamide derivatives 
useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and, more particularly, 
it relates to N-heteroaryl substituted β-mercapto-propanamide 
derivatives useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
as inhibitors of the metabolism of vasoactive peptides. The pharmacologic interest towards the study of molecules which 
inhibit the metabolism of vasoactive peptides derives from the role 
that said peptides exert on the cardiocirculatory system. For instance, among the inhibitors of the metabolism of vasoactive 
peptides, the so-called NEP-inhibitors and ECE-inhibitors hold 
particular interest. In particular, NEP-inhibitors are able to inhibit neutral endopeptidase 
enzyme (NEP), also called enkephalinase, which is responsible 
for the inactivation, not only of endogenous enkephaline, but 
also of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), a vasodilator hormone 
secreted by heart. ECE-inhibitors, instead, are able to inhibit endothelin converting 
enzyme (ECE), which is responsible for the transformation of big-endothelin 
into endothelin, a 21 amino acid peptide with vasoconstrictor 
activity. Therefore, both ECE-inhibitors and NEP-inhibitors are useful in 
therapy in the treatment of hypertension, renal failure and congestive 
heart failure. The molecule which is considered the parent of ECE-inhibitors is 
phosphoramidon [N-[N-[[(6-deoxy-α-L-mannopyranosyl)oxy]hydroxyphosphinyl]-L-leucyl]-L-tryptophan], 
first isolated as microbial  
 
metabolite [Umezawa et al., Tetrahedron Letters, No. 1, pages 
97-100, (1972)] and subsequently studied as inhibitor of the 
metabolism of vasoactive peptides [see, for instance, Matsumura et 
al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 185 (1990), 103-106]. The molecule which is considered the parent of NEP-inhibitors is 
thiorphan [DL-(3-mercapto-2-benzylpropanoyl)glycine], first described 
by Roques et al. in Nature, Vol. 288, pages 286-288, (1980). Several molecules with NEP-inhibitory activity, other than thiorphan, 
are described in the literature. Some of them are chemically related to the structure of β-mercapto-propanamides. The International patent application No. WO 93/09101 (Fujisawa 
Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.) describes β-mercapto-propanamides of formula 
 
wherein R1 is hydrogen or a protecting group; R2 is a lower alkyl or 
a phenyl optionally substituted by a lower alkylenedioxy; R3 is 
tetrazolyl, thiazolyl or thiadiazolyl optionally substituted by acyl 
or acyl-lower alkyl groups; A is a lower
