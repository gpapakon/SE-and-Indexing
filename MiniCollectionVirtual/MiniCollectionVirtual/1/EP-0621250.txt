<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a codimerisation process between at least one monoolefinic compound, for example a monoolefinic hydrocarbon such as ethylene, propylene or 1-butene, a halogenated monoolefin such as vinyl chloride, or a functional olefinic compound such as methyl acrylate, acrylonitrile, allyl acetate or vinyl acetate, and at least one polyolefinic compound containing at least two conjugated or non-conjugated ethylenic bonds, for example a diene (dienic) hydrocarbon such as 1,3-butadiene, piperylene or isoprene or a polyolefinic compound containing a carboxyl functional group, such as a fatty acid or a fatty acid ester containing 14 to 24 carbon atoms in the fatty chain deriving, for example, from a natural oil, the reaction being carried out in the presence of a catalytic system of general formula [RhX4]
[YR4] in which X represents a halide ion or a group SO4

 group, at least one X being
a halide, Y represents a nitrogen atom or a phosphorous atom and R represents an alkyl,

cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl, polystyryl, alkylpolystyryl or acyl radical.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that said monoolefin is selected from
monoolefinic hydrocarbons, halogenated monoolefins and monoolefinic compounds

containing carboxylic or nitrile groups.
Process according to claim 2, characterised in that said monoolefinic compound is selected
from ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, vinyl chloride, methyl acrylate, acrylonitrile, allyl acetate

and vinyl acetate.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that said compound
comprising at least two ethylenic bonds is selected from conjugated or conjugatable, aliphatic

or cyclic dienes and dienic, trienic or tetraenic compounds containing carboxylic functions
wherein the ethylenic bonds are conjugated or conjugatable.
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that said compound containing at least two
ethylenic bonds is selected from 1,3-butadiene, piperylene and isoprene.
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that said compound containing at least two
ethylenic bonds is selected from monocarboxylic acids containing 14 to 26 carbon atoms and

their esters formed with mono-, di- or trifunctional aliphatic alcohols containing 1 to 18
carbon atoms.
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that said alcohol is selected from methanol,
ethanol, neopentylglycol, trimethylolpropane and glycerol. 
Process according to claim 6 or claim 7, characterised in that said monocarboxylic acids and
said esters are derived from natural plant or vegetable oils.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the rhodium compound in
the catalytic system comprises a hydrated rhodium chloride and the quaternary salt comprises

a NR
