<ABSTRACT>
A boardlock clip is described, for holding a connector (12, Fig. 3) to a 
circuit board (14) and for electrically grounding them to each other, which is strong 

and which assures a reliable solder connection between the clip and a board 
plating. The clip has a mount (30) for mounting on a connector and a boardlock 

(32) for insertion into a cylindrical circuit board hole (26), the boardlock including 
three downwardly extending beams (41 - 43) with lower portions (52) that engage 

the bottom (56) of the hole walls. Each beam lower portion has a flat middle part 
(62) and has a pair of edge parts (64, 66) that are bent partially radially outwardly 

so the edge parts directly engage the bottom of the hole walls, for increased 
strength and to provide distinct solder locations. The upper portion of each beam 

has edge parts (92, 94) which are bent radially inwardly to avoid contacting the 
hole walls while stiffening the beam upper portion against bending.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is common practice to mount a connector to a circuit board by boardlock clips that
extend into holes drilled into the circuit board. U.S. Patent 4,865,555 shows an example
of such a clip, which has beams with lower portions extending at an outward
incline to press against the lower ends of the board holes, the clips being soldered
into place. U.S. Patent 5,024,607 shows a further example of a clip, which has a flat
L-shape bended body member, for mounting on a connectors top and rear face,
having a pair of locking legs for insertion into a circuit board hole to hold the
connector substanially against the board. The locking legs have hook portions
for locking beneath the bottom of the printed circuit board, and the legs are oppositely
curved in cross-section to present convex surfaces facing each other.A boardlock clip of cylindrical type, wherein the beams were strengthened and rigidized
against bending for higher holding force, and wherein the solder connections
were more predictable, would be of value.In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a boardlock clip is
provided for mounting a connector on a circuit board, wherein the clip has high
strength and provides for predictable soldering to a plated circuit board hole. The clip
may also have one or more beams if desired. The clip has a plurality of downwardly
extending beams that lie in the circuit board hole and which include lower beam
portions that engage the lower ends of the board hole. Each lower beam portion has
a middle part and opposite edge parts, with each edge part being bent radially outwardly
to engage the bottom of the board holes while the middle part is spaced from
the board hole. The bent edge parts lie on a section of the beam lower portion which
is of greatest width, with the beam lower portion being tapered to be narrower both
above and below the section of greatest width. Each upper beam portion has a middle
part and has opposite edge parts that are bent at least partially radially inwardly
from the middle part to strengthen and stiffen the upper beam portion. When the boardlock clip is fully inserted into the connector and circuit board to
hold them together, the clip is usually soldered in place to the plated hole of the
circuit board. The shape of each lower beam portion results in a reliable solder
connection between the bent edge part of each beam lower portion and the plated
hole walls.The novel features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended
claims. The invention will be best

<CLAIMS>
A boardlock clip (16, 18) having a substantially cylindrical mount (30) for
mounting on a connector (12) and having a boardlock (32) for insertion into a

circuit board hole (26) to hold the connector (12) substantially against the
board (14), and wherein the clip (16, 18) has a vertical axis (46) and a plurality

of retention beams (41, 42, 43) extending generally downwardly from the
mount (30), each beam (41, 42, 43) having a upper portion (50) and a lower

beam portion (52) with a radially outwardly-downwardly angled surface (54)

characterized by:
each of said upper portions (50) has a middle part (90) and opposite edge
parts (92, 94), said edge parts being bent radially inwardly, partially towards

said axis (46) and
