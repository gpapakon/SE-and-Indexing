<ABSTRACT>
Reagent grade hydrochloric acid having an iron content of less than 200 p.p.b. is 
made from an industrial organic isocyanate manufacturing process by removing hydrogen 

chloride from organic isocyanates produced in the reaction between phosgene and an 
organic amine, converting the hydrogen chloride to concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid, 

and contacting the acid with a strongly basic anion exchange resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a process for the purification of byproducts produced 
during the manufacture of organic isocyanates, and more particularly, to a process for the 
removal of a hydrochloric acid stream from the manufacture of organic isocyanates and 
passing the hydrochloric acid stream over a bed of a strongly basic anionic exchange resin 
to produce reagent grade hydrochloric acid containing iron impurities in an amount of no 
more than 200 parts per billion. It is well known that organic isocyanates, including the more commonly known 
diisocyanates such as diphenylmethane diisocyanate and toluene diisocyanate, may be 
manufactured by contacting in a reaction chamber an excess of phosgene (COCl2) with an 
organic amine, such as toluenediamine (TDA) or diphenylmethane diamine (MDA), in the 
presence of a solvent. The reaction products between phosgene and an organic amine, more 
specifically an aromatic diamine, are the corresponding organic isocyanate and hydrogen 
chloride according to the following equation: 
 
Most of the hydrogen chloride is a vapor which may be removed from the manufacture of 
the organic isocyanate at the overhead of the reaction chamber for collection, conversion 
to aqueous hydrochloric acid, and eventual sale. Although most of the hydrogen chloride 
evolves as a gas in the reaction between the organic amine and phosgene, some remains  
 
entrained in the isocyanate stream along the bottom of the reaction chamber. The 
entrained hydrogen chloride may be recovered further downstream by way of, for example, 
distillation. The hydrogen chloride vapor collected from all stages in the manufacture of 
organic isocyanates is liquified by contact with water to produce aqueous hydrochloric acid, 
which is then sold as technical grade hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid can only be sold as technical grade or food grade because it 
often contains iron contaminants in amounts greater than 200 parts per billion. Until now, 
it has been impossible to guarantee reagent grade quality hydrochloric acid removed from 
the industrial manufacture of organic isocyanates. The source of iron in the manufacture 
of organic isocyanates is not known for certain; however, it is believed that trace amounts 
of iron may be present in the water used to liquify gaseous hydrogen chloride, or the 
gaseous hydrogen chloride may slightly corrode the inner lining of the reaction chamber, 
pipes, fittings, etc. due to the presence of minor traces of water impurities in the reaction 
chamber.

<CLAIMS>
A method for making aqueous hydrochloric acid having an iron content of less than 
200 p.p.b. from the manufacture of organic isocyanates comprising 


a) reacting an organic amine with phosgene to form hydrogen chloride and an 
organic isocyanate, 
b) removing hydrogen chloride from the organic isocyanate and, if present, 
unreacted organic amine and phosgene, 
c) converting the removed hydrogen chloride to a hydrochloric acid stream, and, 
d) contacting the hydrochloric acid with a strong basic anion exchange resin. 
The process of claim 1, wherein the concentration of hydrochloric acid in the aqueous 

hydrochloric acid stream is from 36 weight percent to 38 weight percent based on the total 
weight of all ingredients in the aqueous hydrochloric acid stream. 
The process of claim 1, wherein gaseous hydrochloric acid is removed from the 
organic diisocyanate, is converted to an aqueous hydrochloric acid stream by contacting with 

water, which aqueous hydrochloric acid stream is contacted with a gel strong basic anionic 
exchange resin to reduce iron impurities contained in the aqueous stream. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the exchange resin is a gel having quaternary 
ammonium groups as active sites. 
The method of claim 4, wherein the quaternary ammonium groups are - 
N(CH

The method of claim 1, wherein liquid hydrogen chloride is removed from the 
organic isocyanate and converted to aqueous hydrochloric acid.  

 
The method of claim 1, wherein the aqueous hydrochloric acid contacts the exchange 
resin for a residence time ranging from 30 seconds to six minutes. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the aqueous hydrochloric acid stream contains 50 
p.p.b. or less of iron after contact with the exchange resin.
