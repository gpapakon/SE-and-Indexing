<ABSTRACT>
A personal dust sampler, (3 cm2), hangs from a ribbon (10) attached to the user's clothing and requires no pump or power source. Dust in the air is captured by a charged PVC sheet (2) exposed at (2a) but framed by a metal foil (25) and surmounted by a metal conductor plate (6) parallel to (2). The plate (6) is supported by conductive gridwork (3) removeably attached via a flange (30) to a metal base (21). The dust captured is determined by weighing or by measuring the charge loss of the PVC sheet (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a passive dust sampler.Dust samplers are known in which the atmosphere containing the
dust to be sampled is pumped through a collector (such as a filter
medium), which traps the dust for subsequent analysis or
measurement. Such a sampler requires a pump, which is bulky, and
the pump in turn requires a power source, which adds to the mass
and bulk. Because these samplers positively transport the dust to
the collector, they may be called active dust samplers.For personal use, it would be desirable to have a passive dust
sampler, i.e. one without a pump or power source, which would
sample dust at a rate proportional to its atmospheric concentration
in the immediate vicinity, biassed (ideally) towards smaller
particles, these generally being more harmful to the human lung.
A personal sampler should also be lightweight.A passive dust sampler must work by moving the sampled
material relative to the dust-laden air. Passive gas samplers make
use of the diffusive motion of molecules to transport them to an
adsorbing surface. Since the masses of all molecules of any
chemical species are virtually identical, the average velocity of
transport can be easily and accurately calculated. Dust particles
also undergo diffusive motion but their average velocity is many
orders of magnitude smaller than that of molecules, and so this is
not an effective transport process. Capture must be brought about
by external forces, and the only forces sufficiently large to be
effective are gravity and electrostatic attraction.J. Pich in Aerosol Science (1966) Ed. C.N. Davies,
Academic Press, London 1966, discloses that a uniformly charged
fibre captures charged particles at a rate dependent on the number
of the charged particles passing per unit volume but independent of
their velocity. In addition, the rate at which the charged body
will collect charged particles of the opposite sign will be
proportional to the electrical mobility of the particles. The
electrical mobility of a particle is the velocity of the particle
caused by an electric field, divided by the field strength. If capture takes place by gravity, the same velocity-independence is observed, but
the capture rate is proportional to the square of the aerodynamic diameter of the particles,
and this would favour the capture of large particles and selectively exclude small ones, the
opposite of what the invention seeks.Vincent etal. in the Institute of Occupational Medicine's Report TM83/15 (1983)
