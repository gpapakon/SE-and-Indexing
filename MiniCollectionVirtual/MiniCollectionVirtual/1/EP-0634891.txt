<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transceiver 
circuit module for use in both transmission and reception 
in a radio communication apparatus. In the United States and Europe, a cordless 
telephone system carries out communication using a high 
frequency of 900 MHz between a host phone set and child 
phone sets (cordless extensions). Also, in Japan, the high 
frequency of 900 MHz is used for portable telephones. A prior art transceiver circuit module used in 
the above-mentioned communication system is comprised of 
a transmitting circuit section and a receiving circuit 
section mounted on a board. In the prior art transceiver 
circuit module, however, the transmitting circuit section 
and the receiving circuit section are not clearly isolated 
from each other. As a result, interference from high 
frequency signals may occur between the transmitting 
circuit section and the receiving circuit section, which 
creates noise therein. Also, circuits in the transmitting 
circuit section and the receiving circuit section are 
located on the board without consideration of a stream of 
signals thereof, so that ground connections connected to 
the circuits may not be short enough, thus destabilizing 
the operation of the circuits at high frequencies.  
 A transceiver circuit according to the preamble of claim 1 
is disclosed in EP-A-0 504 020. US-A-5,107,404 discribes a circuit board assembly for a 
cellular telephone system comprising a housing wherein RF 
interference generating components are shielded. It is an object of the invention to provide a transceiver 
circuit module capable of avoiding interference from high 
frequency signals between circuits. Another object of the invention is to stabilize the operation 
of a transceiver circuit module at high frequency. These objects are achieved by a transceiver circuit module 
as defined in claim 1; the remaining claims are related to 
further developments of the invention.  
 According to the present invention, in a 
transceiver circuit module, a transmitting circuit 
section and a receiving circuit section are located on a 
board, and the transmitting circuit section and the 
receiving circuit section are electromagnetically 
isolated from each other by an electromagnetic shield 
wall. As a result, interference from high frequency 
signals between the transmitting section and the 
receiving section can be avoided. Also, in the present invention, circuits of the 
transmitting circuit section and circuits of the receiving 
circuit section are arranged so that a
