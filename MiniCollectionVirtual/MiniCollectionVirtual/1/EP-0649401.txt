<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of halonitroalkanes, e.g. bromonitromethane, is disclosed in which a nitroalkane is reacted with an alkali metal base or an alkaline earth metal base, and the resulting nitroalkane salt is halogenated to form the halonitroalkane in a reaction mixture. The process is improved by acidifying the reaction mixture, preferably to pH = 0-4, and thereafter recovering the halonitroalkane by azeotropic distillation of the reaction mixture. The acidification step increases the amount of halonitroalkane recovered, as compared to prior art processes in which the reaction mixture is distilled without prior acidification.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to processes for the 
preparation of halonitroalkanes, e.g. bromonitromethane, and 
particularly to an improved method for the recovery of 
halonitroalkanes from a reaction mixture. Processes for the production of halonitroalkanes such as 
bromonitromethane are well known in the art. The 
conventional method for preparing bromonitromethane is 
disclosed in United States Patent No. 2,632,776, issued to 
Slagh on March 24, 1953. This process comprises first 
reacting nitromethane with an alkali metal hydroxide, calcium 
hydroxide or barium hydroxide to yield the nitromethane salt 
in solution. Bromine is then admixed with the salt solution 
and the bromonitromethane readily forms and is recovered by 
steam distillation. This process is reported to be useful in 
preparing bromonitromethane in yields of 70-90% of 
theoretical. Similar processes for the preparation of 
halonitroalkanes are described in United States Patent Nos. 
4,922,030 and 5,043,489, issued to Nocito et al. on May 1, 
1990 and August 27, 1991, respectively. The prior art has recognized the need to control various 
parameters of the basic reaction scheme in order to obtain 
halonitroalkanes in high yield. The Slagh patent recognizes 
the importance of controlling a number of factors, including  
 
the proportions of nitroalkane, alkali, water and bromine 
used; the temperatures at which the salt formation and 
bromination are performed; the time between formation of the 
salt and its subsequent bromination; and the rate of addition 
of bromine. The Nocito et al. patents also emphasize many of 
the foregoing considerations, and also suggest the use after 
the second step of a compound, such as sodium bisulfite, to 
destroy unreacted bromine to avoid over bromination of the 
nitroalkane. One method of recovery of the prepared halonitroalkane is 
by extraction, for example using methylene chloride (MDC). 
The MDC layer is isolated and the MDC is removed under 
reduced pressure at temperatures below about 30°C, and no 
product degradation occurs. However, this introduces a 
solvent into an otherwise organic solvent-free system, and 
adds additional costs to the process. Alternatively, the halonitroalkane may be recovered by 
azeoptropic distillation, e.g. steam distillation. However, 
it has been determined that the recovery of halonitroalkanes 
by steam distillation of the reaction effluent results in 
loss of some of the product, resulting in reduced yield. 
There has therefore remained a need to provide for an
