<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foamed
thermoplastic resin sheet manufacturing device which
performs expansion under a reduced pressure.As a conventional method for producing a foamed
thermoplastic resin sheet (hereinafter sometimes referred
to simply as "sheet"), a manufacturing method wherein a
thermoplastic resin and a foaming agent are melted and
kneaded in an extruder and extruded through a die into
under the atmospheric pressure has been well known. In 
obtaining a highly foamed sheet by this manufacturing
method, however, there are inconveniences that a great
amount of a foaming agent is needed, and that cells
become more coarse as the sheet expands, thereby
deteriorating a strength of the sheet.As a method which has such inconveniences solved, a
method in which the foamy thermoplastic resin material
extruded from an extruder is passed through a vacuum
device so that the foamy thermoplastic resin is further
expanded has been practiced.For example, the Japanese Publication for Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 54215/1990 (Tokukohei 2-54215)
(the Japanese Patent No. 1639854) discloses an
arrangement wherein a roll-like haul-off machine is
installed in a vacuum chamber so that the sheet-like
foamy thermoplastic resin material is extruded through a
die to the vacuum chamber so as to expand and the
material thus foamed is hauled by the haul-off machine.The Japanese Examined Patent Publication 29328/1983
(The Japanese Patent No. 1199174) discloses an
arrangement in which a sealing member for ensuring
reduction of a pressure in a vacuum chamber is provided
at an outlet of the vacuum chamber and a roll-like haul-off
machine is installed behind the vacuum chamber so as
to haul a sheet-like foamy thermoplastic resin material 
which is extruded through a die to the vacuum chamber
thereby expanding.Incidentally, in the present specification, a
thermoplastic resin expanded under a reduced pressure at
a first expansion stage is referred to as "foamy
thermoplastic resin," and the foamed thermoplastic resin
further expanded under the reduced pressure to a
completely expanded state, obtained after or immediately
before curing, is referred to as "foamed thermoplastic
resin." A thermoplastic resin in a state of being
expanded under a reduced pressure is to be classified as
the former "foamy thermoplastic resin."By the conventional arrangements described above,
foamed thermoplastic resin sheets with only one thickness
are produced. Therefore, to produce foamed thermoplastic
resin sheets with various thicknesses, a
