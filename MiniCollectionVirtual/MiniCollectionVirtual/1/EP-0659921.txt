<ABSTRACT>
Chain stitch, the repeated use of which makes it possible to construct a series of identical loops, the foot (150) of the lobe (160, 161, 162) of each of which prevents the unravelling of the preceding loop and of which it is sufficient to pull on the free part (17) of the thread of the last knitted stitch to cause the unravelling of the latter and also gradually of all the other stitches, characterised in that it comprises a second thread (18) arranged according to a scallop, each turn (180, 181, 182) of which grips the foot (150) of each lobe (160, 161, 162) of a corresponding chain loop. The use of the two-thread chain stitch (20) is particularly suitable for the packaging of elongate products (50) arranged parallel to one another, for example hanger hooks, on which are suspended garments thus grouped together in armfuls.

Chain stich, the repeated use of which 
permits the formation of a set of identical loops, 

the foot (150, 151, 152) of the lobe (160, 161, 
162) of each of which prevents the preceding one 

from coming undone, and in the case of which it is 
sufficient to pull on the free part (17) of the 

thread of the last knitted stich to cause this 
latter, and, step by step, all the other stitches, 

to come undone, characterised in that it comprises 
a second thread (18) arranged in a shell 

scalloping stich, each volute (180, 181, 182) of 
which hugs the foot (150, 151, 152) of each lobe 

(160, 161, 162) of the loop of the corresponding 
chain stitch tightly. 
Use of the chain stitch with two threads 
(20) according to Claim 1 for conditioning 

products (50) in a long line arranged parallel to 
one another, characterised in that the chain 

stitch is knitted around the products in the long 
line, these being hugged tightly between two 

points and two successive shell scalloping 
stitches (180, 181, 182).  

 
Application of the use of the chain stitch 
according to Claim 2 to the conditioning of 

products, each of which is suspended on a clothes 
hanger, each clothes hanger being suspended on a 

bar by its hook, these products being conditioned 
in batches in which they are grouped firmly whilst 

being, however, easily detachable, each batch 
being formed by the knitting of the cross stitch 

onto the parallel vertical bases (50) of the hooks 
of each clothes hanger of the batch.
