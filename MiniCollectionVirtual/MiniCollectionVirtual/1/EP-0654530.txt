<DESCRIPTION>
Part of the work performed during development of this invention 
utilized U.S. Government funds. Therefore, the U.S. Government has certain 
rights in this invention. This invention is directed to a novel species of E2 ubiquitin-carrier 
protein of eukaryotes. In particular, this invention is directed to E2-F1, which 
is isolated and purified from rabbit reticulocytes. This invention is further 
directed to the use of purified E2-F1 to produce antibodies, and the use of 
such antibodies to detect the presence of E2-F1 in a biological sample. This 
invention is also directed to the use of E2-F1 antibodies to inhibit protein 
degradation. This invention is further directed to recombinant DNA molecules 
which code for E2-F1, and to recombinant hosts and vectors which contain the 
gene coding for E2-F1. This invention is also directed to the use of such 
recombinant hosts and vectors to produce E2-F1 protein. This invention is 
further directed to the use of purified E2-F1 to identify and isolate E3 enzyme. 
This invention is also directed to methods for screening substances for the 
ability to inhibit E2-F1 enzyme activity.  Intracellular protein degradation plays an important role in the 
regulation of the levels of specific proteins and the elimination of damaged, 
or abnormal proteins (for recent reviews, see Hershko et al., Annu. Rev. 
Biochem. 61:761-807 (1992); Jentsch, Annu. Rev. Genet. 26:179-207 (1992)). 
This process is highly selective in that certain proteins are degraded in 
minutes, while other proteins are practically stable. In general, regulatory 
proteins or enzymes have fast turnover rates, so that their levels can be rapidly 
changed in response to appropriate stimuli. In some cases, the rates of 
degradation of regulatory proteins are controlled with great precision. For 
example, cyclin levels oscillate at certain stages of the cell cycle and thus, 
control cell cycle progression. It is necessary to identify and to characterize enzymatic reactions 
involved in intracellular protein degradation in order to understand 
mechanisms which underlie the selectivity and regulation of intracellular 
protein breakdown. It now appears that the selective degradation of many 
proteins in eukaryotic cells is carried out the ubiquitin-mediated pathway. 
Ubiquitination of proteins has been implicated in a variety of key cellular 
processes such as the regulation of cell cycle and division, removal of 
defective proteins, provision of amino acids under stressed conditions, 
presentation of antigens,
