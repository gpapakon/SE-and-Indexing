<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a scraper device for the return run (strand) of a conveyor belt, which comprises a block of elongate form (14), made from elastic material, bears on a support profile (16), the block of elongate form (14) having a central zone via which it is in contact with the support profile (16) and, on either side of this central zone, a zone in which the block of elongate form (14) is separate from the abovementioned support profile (16).

A scraper device for the return run (1') of a 
conveyor belt, comprising a scraper blade in the form of an 

elongate block (14), of resilient material, against which 
there rests a support profile (16) which exerts pressure in 

the direction of the return run (1'), characterised in that 
the elongate block (14) has a central zone by means of which 

it is in contact with the support profile (16) and, on each 
side of this central zone, a zone in which the edge of the 

elongate block (14) deviates progressively from the support 
profile (16). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the elongate block (14) has one substantially convex side 

which is in contact with the above-mentioned support profile 
(16) in its central zone. 
A device according to either one of claims 1 - 2, 
characterised in that at least one stiffener (20) is embedded 

in the mass constituting the elongate block (14) of resilient 
material. 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the above-mentioned stiffener element (20) consists of steel, 

the steel being resilient. 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the above-mentioned stiffener element (20) consists of glass 

fibres. 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the above-mentioned stiffener element (20) consists of carbon 

fibres. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 - 6, 
characterised in that the above-mentioned support profile 

(16) supports two plates (19) between which the elongate 
block (14) of resilient material may be positioned, the ends  

 
of the above-mentioned support profile (16) being provided 

with journals (22) which are immobilised in jaws (23) 
themselves supported by damping blocks (25). 
A device according to claim 7, characterised in that 
between the two above-mentioned plates (19) there is arranged 

at least one small centring shaft (18) which engages in a 
slot (17) formed in the elongate block (14) of resilient 

material when the latter has been slipped between the two 
above-mentioned plates (19). 
A device according to any one of claims 1 - 8, 
characterised in that scraper inserts (31) are firmly connected 

with the elongate block (14) of resilient material. 
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the above-mentioned scraper inserts (31) are each 

substantially in the form of a trapezium, of which the large 
base constitutes the edge of the scraper blade. 
A device according to claim 9, characterised in that 
the above-mentioned scraper inserts (31) are each in the form 

of a trapezium, extended by rectangles on the side which, 
when viewed in their position of use, is oriented towards the 

return run of the scraper belt. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 - 11, 
characterised in that the above-mentioned support profile 

(16) is supported by its ends in damping blocks. 
A device according to claim 12, characterised in 
that the above-mentioned damping blocks are adjustable in the 

direction in which pressure may be exerted on the above-mentioned 
return run (1'). 
A device according to either one of claims 12 and 
13, characterised in that the above-mentioned damping blocks 

comprise a block of deformable material (25) to which is 
firmly connected at least one plate (24) on which is fixed a 

holding means for the above-mentioned metal support profile.
