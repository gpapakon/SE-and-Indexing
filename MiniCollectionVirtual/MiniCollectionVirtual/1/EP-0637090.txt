<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing an anode
material for a lithium secondary battery employing a non-aqueous
electrolyte and exhibiting superior capacity and
charge-discharge characteristics.Lithium secondary batteries using carbonaceous
materials as anode materials have already been
used to obtain such advantages as high energy
density, lightness and compactness and storability
over long periods.However, in response to the trend toward miniaturization
of electronic devices, it is necessary
to improve the extent to which it is possible to
realize higher capacities.For example, there have been proposals that high capacity be
achieved by adjusting the content of elements other
than carbon present in the material to optimum
levels, Japanese Laid Open Patent Application
Numbers 1991-137010 and 1993-74457 disclose carbonaceous
materials containing the element
phosphorus, and Japanese Laid Open Patent Application
Number 1991-245458 discloses a carbonaceous
material containing boron, European Patent Application
No. EP-A-547794 discloses as an anode
material having a high capacity comprising a carbonaceous
material containing nitrogen made by the
calcination of an organic precursor compound obtained
by reacting a conjugated polycyclic compound
with a nitrocompound or a nitrating agent, and
Japanese Laid Open Patent Application Number 1992-278751
discloses a sulphur containing carbonaceous
anode material. EP-A-498049 discloses the pre-lithanation of anode materials.However, to realize the potential of an anode 
material for high capacity during use in a battery
to the same extent that it has been realized for
these carbonaceous materials when they are used as
simple electrodes, it is necessary to reduce or
eliminate the capacity loss during the initial
charge discharge cycle. In the case where the
cathode is made from a compound in which lithium
can be stored such as, for example, LiCoO2, to make
the anode from carbonaceous materials it is necessary
to charge the battery after assembly and at
this time the capacity loss is considerable and the
amount of usable lithium decreases making it impossible
to achieve a battery having a desirably large
capacity.One solution to the problem of supplying lithium
to cover the loss is to include the amount of
lithium expected to be lost in the carbonaceous
material. For example, before assembling the
battery, it is possible to absorb the lithium into
the carbonaceous material electrochemically, or, to
attach metallic lithium to the carbonaceous material
to
