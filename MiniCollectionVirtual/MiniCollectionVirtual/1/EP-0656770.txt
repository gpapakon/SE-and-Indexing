<ABSTRACT>
Primarily adapted for use in photo-thermal-keratoplasty procedures wherein a human eye is corrected for near-sightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and the like, by shrinking collagen within the cornea through controlled heating with infra-red radiation, an optical system is provided to controllably generate an infra-red radiation pattern. A moveable muti-faceted prism (87) is a primary optical element. Both the infra-red heating radiation and visible aiming radiation are delivered to the prism (87) by a multi-mode optical fiber (25). The optical elements are arranged to provide an attending physician with a clear view through the system of the eye being treated. Adjustment of the infra-red pattern is electrically controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR EXPOSING A HUMAN EYE TO A CONTROLLED PATTERN OF RADIATION SPOTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to various methods of treating a human eye with focused electromagnetic radiation, and, more specifically, to an improved apparatus for controllably focusing one or more spots of electromagnetic radiation on a cornea. Although there are many specific treatment procedures involving the necessity for directing a highly controlled beam of electromagnetic radiation to an eye, keratoplasty procedures are currently receiving a great deal of attention because of their ability to correct an eye for nearsightednesÎµ, farsightedness and/or astigmatism. In one surgical procedure, a radiation beam is used to cut controlled portions of the cornea by ablation of tissue in its path. A specific application of this is in the performance of radial keratotomy procedures without the necessity of using the knife to perform radial cuts in the cornea.An alternative procedure, which avoids cutting the cornea, directs one or more focused beams of electromagnetic radiation within the infrared portion of the spectrum into the eye to thermally shrink collagen tissue within the cornea in order to cause permanent corrective changes in the cornea curvature. This later technique often termed photo-thermal-keratoplasty, is the subject of U.S. Patent No. 4,976,709, issued December 11, 1990 to Dr. Bruce J. Sand. The collagen 

shrinkage technique promises to provide permanent changes to the optical characteristics of the human cornea with a higher degree of safety and patient comfort than is the case with techniques that involve physically cutting and removing portions of the cornea. In order for an ophthalmologist or other attending physician to be able to efficiently perform corrective photo-thermal-keratoplasty procedures on a large number of patients with a high degree of accuracy and effectiveness, it is desired to provide an instrument that accurately directs the correct amount of infrared radiation into the patient's cornea with a pattern that is controllable by the physician with a high degree of accuracy. A basis for such an instrument is described in published European Patent Application No. 402,250, dated December 12, 1990, of Parel et al. The instrument there disclosed provides a controllable arc, circle, radial lines, or array of spots of infrared radiation across the cornea of a patient's eye. The Parel et al. system configuration is described as useful for any of several
