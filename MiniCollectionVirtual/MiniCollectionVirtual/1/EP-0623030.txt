<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bioabsorbable 
polymers, particularly poly(esteramides). Poly(esteramides) are known to be useful 
bioabsorbable polymeric materials derived from reacting 
diamidediols with dicarboxylic acids, derivatives 
thereof or bischloroformates. Such polymers and some of 
their uses are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,343,931; 
4,529,792; 4,534,349; 4,669,474; 4,719,917; 4,883,618; 
and 5,013,315 (all Barrows et al.). An increasing number of surgically implantable 
devices that only function for a relatively short period 
of time in vivo are being designed from synthetic 
polymers that are eliminated from the body by hydrolytic 
degradation and subsequent metabolism after serving 
their intended purpose. The molecular weight of such 
"bioabsorbable" polymers is an important parameter in 
determining whether or not a particular lot of polymer 
will perform properly for an adequate length of time in 
any specific application. Thus, if significant loss of molecular weight 
occurs during processing of the polymer into the device, 
such as by melt extrusion, then the device may fail 
prematurely in vivo as hydrolysis shifts the molecular 
weight distribution below a minimum range required for 
the device to function properly. Loss of molecular 
weight upon extrusion is commonly encountered with 
polyesters even when moisture in the resin has been 
reduced to the lowest possible level. For example, 
poly-L-lactide, a well known bioabsorbable polyester has 
not yet been melt extruded into fiber with molecular  
 
weight much higher than 100,000 since the extrusion 
process degrades higher molecular weight fractions to 
this relatively constant maximum value. Bioabsorbable poly(esteramides) described in 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,343,931 and 4,529,792 offer an 
advantage over poly-L-lactide and related polyesters in 
that a lower molecular weight is adequate to achieve 
comparable fiber strength due to the intermolecular 
hydrogen bonding provided by the amide linkages. Fibers 
made of such polymers exhibit comparable strength to 
those made of poly-L-lactide while providing lower 
modulus (and thus greater flexibility) and greater 
toughness and durability. Compared to poly-L-lactide 
they also are more rapidly bioabsorbed. It has been discovered that a certain class of 
poly(esteramides) provides surprisingly superior results 
in comparison to other poly(esteramides). In 
particular, the poly(esteramides) of the invention 
provide a heretofore unrecognized combination of rapid 
degradation
