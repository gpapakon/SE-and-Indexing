<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catalyst system comprising three catalysts for removing NOx, CO and polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans from exhaust gases from combustion plants, in particular from waste incineration plants. In the direction of flow of the exhaust gas, the catalysts are arranged in a manner such that at a first position a catalyst is situated for the reduction of NOx with NH3, at a second position a catalyst is situated for the oxidation of CO and NH3 with molecular oxygen and at a third position a catalyst is situated for the oxidation of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans with molecular oxygen.
