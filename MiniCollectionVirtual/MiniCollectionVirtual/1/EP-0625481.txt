<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the preparation
of hydrogen and carbon monoxide rich gas. In particular,
the invention relates to a process and reactor for the
preparation of such gas by high temperature catalytic steam
reforming of a hydrocarbon feedstock.Hydrogen and carbon monoxide rich gases are used as
synthesis gas mainly in the production of ammonia and methanol,
furthermore, during steel production and as fuel or
town gas.Industrial preparation methods presently comprise
high temperature steam reforming processes, like autothermal
catalytic reforming or primary and secondary steam
reforming of hydrocarbons.At high temperature steam reforming processes a
hydrocarbon feedstock is combusted together with air,
oxygen, or oxygen enriched air in a burner mounted at the
top of a reaction vessel. Oxygen is, thereby, supplied in
amounts, which are less than the amount required for complete
combustion and hydrogen and carbon monoxide are
produced in an effluent gas mainly by flame reactions:
Cn Hm + n/2 O2 → n CO + m/2 H2 Cn Hm + n O2 → n CO2 + m/2 H2 
which are strongly exothermic for all hydrocarbons. This
process is most usually used in the reforming of lighter
feedstocks ranging from natural gas to naphtha fractions
with a boiling point up to 200°C.During the process only a part of the hydrocarbon
feedstock is oxidized with an oxygen containing atmosphere
by the above flame reactions (1,2). Residual hydrocarbons
in the gas stream from the combustion are then catalytically
steam reformed by the endothermic reaction:
The catalytic steam reforming process is accomplished
at temperatures of about 900-1400°C. Steam is added
to the feed in order to moderate the flame temperature and
increase hydrocarbon conversion in the burner effluent gas.The hydrocarbon feed mixed with steam is burnt with
an oxygen containing atmosphere in the upper portion of a
reactor. Residual hydrocarbons in the combusted gas are
then steam reformed in the presence of a catalyst arranged
as fixed bed in a lower portion of the reactor. Heat for
the endothermic steam reforming reactions is supplied by
the hot effluent gas from the combustion zone in the upper
reactor portion and above the catalyst bed. As the combustion
gas contacts the catalyst, the temperature in the gas
cools to 900-1100°C by the steam reforming reactions in the
catalyst bed.In order to withstand the high temperatures arising
during the exothermic flame reaction (1,2), the reactor
shell is protected by temperature resistant and insulating
refractory lining

<CLAIMS>
A process for the high temperature steam reforming
of hydrocarbons comprising the steps:


i) partially combusting a hydrocarbon feedstock, steam
and an oxygen containing gas stream in

a burner reactor in which the inside wall of the reactor is
lined with an alumina containing insulating refractory

material which forms volatile degradation products during
the partially combustion process;
ii) passing the resulting partially combusted effluent
containing the volatile degradation products to a steam

reforming catalyst for the steam reforming of hydrocarbons
within the partially combusted effluent, characterized by

arranging the steam reforming catalyst into an upper and
lower layer wherein the upper layer has a lower catalytic

activity than the lower layer so as to minimize density of
deposition of the degradation products on the upper layer

of the catalyst bed.
The process of claim 1, characterized in that the
catalytic activity of the steam reforming catalyst in the

upper layer of the catalyst bed is between 1 and 50% of
that of the catalyst in the lower layer.
The process of claim 1, characterized in that the
upper layer of the catalyst bed has a thickness of between

0.30 and 0.60 metres. 
The process of claim 1, characterized in that the
lower layer of the catalyst bed is divided into a number of

sublayers with steam reforming catalyst of increasing steam
reforming activity in relation to the upper layer.
