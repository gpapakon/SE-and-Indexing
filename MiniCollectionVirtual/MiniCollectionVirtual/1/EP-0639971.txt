<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of (-)-2',3'-dideoxythiacytidine or (-)-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine
for the manufacture of a medicament for enhancing or
maintaining the antiviral sensitivity of an HIV population to zidovudine or a
physiologically functional derivative thereof.Zidovudine, which has the chemical name 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, is now well
established as an important and useful chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment or
prophylaxis of HIV-infections including related clinical conditions such as Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), AIDS-related complex (ARC) and also for the
treatment of patients who have an asymptomatic HIV infection or who are HIV
antibody-positive.Following the widespread clinical use of zidovudine in the therapy of such infections
and conditions, it has been observed that in certain instances following prolonged
treatment; the virus may develop a certain level of resistance to zidovudine and
therefore a loss of sensitivity to the drug.Other anti-HIV chemotherapeutic agents have been proposed and investigated.
Among these agents are various classes of non-nucleoside inhibitors of
HIV reverse transcriptase which have been found to have potent anti-HIV activity
invitro. In contrast to nucleoside inhibitors these compounds do not need to be
phosphorylated invivo to exert their inhibitory effect but it has been found that their use
rapidly induces resistance by the virus, i.e. loss of antiviral sensitivity to the compound
by the virus. Other agents include antiviral nucleoside analogues containing an
oxathiolane residue in place of the sugar residue for example nucleosides as described in
European Patent Specification No. 382526 particularly (-)-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine,
otherwise known as 3TC or lamivudine, and PCT Patent Specification No. WO
92/14743 particularly (-)-2'3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine otherwise known as FTC.
These compounds may be prepared as described in the above relevant Patent
Specification.We have now discovered a solution to the problem encountered in anti-HIV therapy of
the development of resistance to zidovudine by the virus. In particular, we have found 
that the development and maintenance of resistance by HIV populations can be reduced
or prevented, i.e. the sensitivity of such populations to zidovudine can be enhanced, by
treating the virus population with an inhibitor of HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT)
which induces a mutation in the RT coding sequence (a) in which the tyrosine residue at
position 181 is
