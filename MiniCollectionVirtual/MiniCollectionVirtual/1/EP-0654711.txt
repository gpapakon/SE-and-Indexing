<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compositions for making structured color images
and applications thereof.As methods for forming polymer pattern or image layers, there are known various
techniques like photolithography, impact printing, such as screen printing, gravure
printing, flexo printing and offset printing, non-impact printing, such as ink-jet printing,
thermal dye diffusion transfer, laser marking, electrodeposition, etc.
In all such imaging and recording methods, the actual coloring material comprises
pigments and dyestuffs combined with appropriate resins, binders, polymers and additives.Such colors are applied, thus, for example, as recording elements of optical memories as
disclosed in JP Kokai 05050757 A, as recording elements of thermal recording memories
as disclosed in EP-A535788, and as coloring materials for color filters of LCDs (liquid
crystal displays) as described in H.Aruga, J.Photopolym.Sci.Technol.,3(1)9-16(1990),
EP-A380223, K.Mizuno et al., Jpn.J.Appl.Phys.,Part 1, 30 3313-17(1991) and
K.Kobayashi, Solid State Technology, 11(1992)15-18. Polymeric pattern layers may be
coloured after crosslinking, for example through thermal dye diffusion transfer with
well-known dyes as mentioned in EP-008828.According to the above literature, pigments and dyestuffs are used in the form of
compositions containing pigments or dyestuffs, polymers or prepolymers and optionally
other additives, which are subject to image formation in order to achieve recording or
form colored patterns. The process usually comprises the polymerization of a prepolymer
or the depolymerization of a structurable polymer by applying heat or electromagnetic
radiation or the combination thereof, and the subsequent development using appropriate
developers; alternatively, pigments or dyestuffs may be applied directly in a selective
pattern, for example through non-impact printing.While dyes in general are deficient in terms of light, heat, solvent and chemical resistance,
pigments in such applications show problems related to dispersion and dispersion stability,
transparency, profile sharpness of absorption or transmission spectra and/or lack of
solubility or diffusibility. Many properties desirable for the dye's or pigment's nice
incorporation into critical systems such as colour LCD's are contradictory with such
required for high quality applications. Unsatisfactory compromises have thus to be 
complied with, like in JP Kokai 60180889 where stability is obtained at the cost of low
optical reflection density and poor
