<ABSTRACT>
A three-fingered golf glove, comprising a middle finger portion, a ring finger portion, 
and a little finger portion, which has the curvatures of the fingers fully gripping a golf club 

handle, leaving the thumb and the index finger uncovered; a plurality of fourchettes (14-17) having 
external edges; each external edge comprising three segments of straight lines connected by two 

small joint curved arcs; a curved end side piece (18) having the shape of the lower side of a hand 
fully gripping a golf club handle; the finger portions, when assembled, having trapezoidal cross-sections; 

a palm tautening strap (45) being fastened to connect the palm side finger portions and the 
rear side finger portions while the hand is in a shape fully gripping a golf club handle, forming 

a loop of tensile force perpendicular to the club axis (50) to completely eliminate bunching and 
wrinkling at the entire palm section of the glove; a thumb strap forming a force line at the palm 

portion in the direction parallel to the club axis; reinforcing threads stitched to the palm portion 
and the palm side and rear side finger portions to strengthen the glove material against being 

stretched permanently when wet; one or a plurality of thin and flexible friction strips sewn to 
the palm portion, the sharp corrugations thereon being parallel to the club axis, to maintain the 

increased anti-twist resistance of the glove, even when the glove is fully wet with rain or 
perspiration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to sport gloves and, more specifically, to golf 
gloves. Generally, the conventional golf gloves have been designed and manufactured in similar 
ways, such that the gloves fit the hand and the fingers stretched straight. These designs have 
originated from the thousand-year-old multi-purpose design, the major function of which was 
to protect the hand from cold or from being injured. The glove was originally used in golf as 
a means of blister protection at the palm-side skin of hand and also to reduce slippage between 
the hand and the golf club handle caused by perspiration. In golf, the primary function of a glove should be to enhance the gripping efficiency of 
the hand. From the mechanics point of view, however, the multi-purpose design has a few 
serious problems which cannot be solved satisfatorily by surface coating techniques or partial 
modifications of the design. When a golf club handle is gripped by a hand wearing such a glove, the palm sides of 
the glove and hand are compression-buckled, bunching and forming wrinkles of various sizes, 
while the rear side of the glove is stretched. Since the bunches and wrinkles, being formed 
generally parallel to the major axis of the gripped golf club handle, are easily shear-deformed, 
the anti-twist resistance of the glove and hand, which is essential to a good golf swing, is 
significantly deteriorated. Also, the rear-side stretching of the glove lowers the gripping 
efficiency, because the tensile force in this stretched side of the glove acts in the opening mode 
for the hand. Another problem with the conventional designs is the slippage between the palm side of  
 
the hand and the palm side inner surface of the glove or between the palm side outer surface of 
the glove and the club handle surface. With highly frictional materials recently developed for 
the club handle and gloves, slippage between the palm side outer surface of a glove and the club 
handle surface has become a minor problem when the contact surfaces are dry. However, when 
the gloves are wet with rain or perspiration, the coefficient of friction of these surfaces is 
lowered significantly, because the water acts like a lubricant between the palm skin of the hand 
and the inner surface of the glove, or between the outer surface of the glove and the golf club 
handle. When the club shaft is subjected to twisting torque during the swing motion or at impact, 
the glove material bunched and wrinkled with the palm skin of the hand is separated

said internal edge sewn to one edge of the corresponding one of said palm side finger portions; 

   an end side piece (18) having an external edge and an internal edge; said external edge sewn 
to the lower edge of rear side little finger portion and rear side hand portion from finger tip to 

wrist edge; said internal edge sewn to lower edge of palm side little finger portion and palm side 
 

hand portion from finger tip to wrist edge;
