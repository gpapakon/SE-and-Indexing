<ABSTRACT>
An electrical installation system which includes miniterminals (2) disposed at predetermined intervals throughout a room, and electrical outlets (S1) which can be moved between respective miniterminals. The miniterminals (2) and the conductors (1) that supply power to the miniterminals are placed behind a protective strip (5). The gap (7) formed between the protective strip (5) and the surface on which the miniterminal (2) is mounted is covered by a covering strip (3) which lies flush with a spring-biassed cover flap (8) which functions to cover the contact entrance to the miniterminal (2) when no electrical outlet (S1) is connected to the terminal. The miniterminal (2) will conveniently include a compartment for accommodating antenna and/or telephone cables. This miniterminal is also conveniently provided with latching means (10) which coact with latching elements (6) on the electrical outlet (S1) when the outlet is connected to the miniterminal (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical installation 
system which includes an optional number of 
electrical outlets disposed within the room or rooms 
in which different electrical apparatus are to be 
connected to the mains network. The electric outlets 
are detachably connectable to one of the miniterminals 
at predetermined intervals along the electrical conductors 
drawn or laid in respective rooms. Each miniterminal 
and associated conductors are protected by a 
strip arrangement. Installations systems of this kind are known from 
US-A 2,647,242, for instance. These known systems 
often include relatively complicated strip arrangements 
and profiled sections, which make assembly and 
installation work and the subsequent fitting of electric 
outlets (sockets) in desired miniterminals difficult 
and laborious. The known installation systems are 
often unattractive from an aesthetic point of view, 
and the miniterminals included in the system often 
lack protective means which function to reset the 
miniterminals automatically to a safe state should an 
outlet or socket not be connected electrically to a 
respective miniterminal. The aforesaid drawbacks associated with known installation 
systems are avoided by means of the present 
invention, which is characterized in that that part of 
a respective miniterminal provided with electrical 
connector means for accommodating an electric outlet  
 
is provided with a cover flap which lies flush with 
the outer surface of the strip when a miniterminal is 
not used. The device will conveniently include a protective 
strip which is secured firmly to the floor, to a wall 
or to the ceiling of a respective room in which the 
system is installed, and also a covering strip which 
extends via and/or between mutually adjacent miniterminals. 
The cover flap of the miniterminal is 
therewith intended to coact with the outer surface of 
the covering strip. The invention also relates to a miniterminal intended 
for use in the aforesaid installation system. In this 
regard, the miniterminal comprises a generally rectangular, 
flat body and a spring-biassed covering flap 
which is mounted in one long side of the body and 
which when inserting an electrical outlet or plug is 
opened against the action of a spring force, so as to 
enable the plug to be inserted freely into corresponding 
electrical contact elements of the miniterminal 
present beneath the cover flap. The present invention also relates to an electrical 
outlet for connection to a miniterminal

<CLAIMS>
An electrical installation system comprising an 
optional number of electrical outlets (S1-S4) disposed 

within the room or rooms in which different electrical 

apparatus shall be connected to the electric mains, 
wherein the electrical outlets (S1-S4) are detachably 

connectable to one of the miniterminals (2) that are 
mounted at predetermined intervals along and connected 

electrically to the electrical conductors (1) drawn in 
said room or rooms, and wherein each miniterminal (2) 

and the conductors (1) are protected by a strip arrangement 
(3, 5), 
characterized
 in that 
that part of a respective miniterminal (2) which is 

provided with connecting means for accommodating an 
electrical outlet (S1-S4) is provided with a cover 

flap (8) which lies flush with the outer surface of 
the strip arrangement (3, 5) when no electric outlet 

(S1-S4) is connected to said miniterminal (2). 
A system according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the strip arrangement (3, 5) 

includes a protective strip (5) which is secured to 
the floor, a wall or the ceiling of said room, and at 

least one covering strip (3) which extends via and/or 
between the mutually adjacent miniterminals (2), the 

respective cover flaps (8) of said miniterminals being 
intended to coact with the outer surface of the covering 

strip (3). 
A system according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the cover flap (8) is 

spring-biassed, wherein the contact pins (19) of an 
electrical outlet (S1-S4) can be inserted into female 

connectors (23) provided in the miniterminal (2) 
against the spring-force of said cover flap (8), said 

spring-force acting to restore the cover flap (8) to 
its closed position as the outlet (S1-S4) is removed 

from the miniterminal.  
 
A system according to any one of the preceding
