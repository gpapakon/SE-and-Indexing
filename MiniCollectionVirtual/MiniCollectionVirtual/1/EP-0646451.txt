<ABSTRACT>
To form a surface of a thermoplastic film with a nonwoven fabric-like 
pattern, a mold (3) is provided with a nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) composed 

of many individual metal fibers intertwined at random and a previously 
heatsoftened thermoplastic film is conformed to a pattern carrying the surface of 

the nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) under a vacuum effect by a vacuum pump or 
a squeezing effect by a squeezing roll.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
forming a surface of a thermoplastic film with a nonwoven
fabric-like pattern defined by individual fibers
intertwined at random.It is well known to press a thermoplastic film,
which has previously been heat-softened, against a mold
carrying thereon a given pattern and thereby to form a
surface of said film with a pattern in conformity to said
given pattern on the mold surface. It is also well known
to place such a film under the effect of vacuum or pressure
so as to be reliably forced as closely as possible against
the mold and thereby to obtain a pattern in faithful
conformity even with fine irregularities present on the
mold surface.In the field of sanitary articles such as
disposable diapers and sanitary napkins, a plastic film
used as an important component of such articles is often
brought in close contact with the user's skin during use of
the articles. To alleviate a sticky feeling of a plastic 
film being closely in contact with the user's skin, the film
surface has sometimes been formed with a woven or nonwoven
fabric-like pattern so that such a pattern may generate on
the film surface appropriate irregulaties serving to reduce
an area of the film surface to be contacted by the user's
skin and correspondingly to alleviate said undesirable
sticky feeling, on one hand, and to alleviate a surface
gloss peculiar to plastic and thereby to improve the
aesthetic appearance of the sanitary articles, on the other
hand.The formation of a woven fabric-like pattern on the
surface of a plastic film can be achieved in a relatively
simplified process, for example, by vacuum molding with use
of a wire gauze as a mold. However, the formation of a
nonwoven fabric-like pattern on the film surface can require
an unacceptable amount of labor and cost to make a mold,
since irregularities corresponding to individual fibers
should be formed on the surface of the metal mold by means
of engraving or etching.WO-A-91/03367 discloses some examples of the formation
of a nonwoven fibrous pattern on a thermoplastic film, in
which the pattern is formed by an engraving roll having a
distribution of elongated fiber depressions and raised fiber
areas simulating nonwoven fibers. A described method
involves the introduction of the thermoplastic film in a
plastic state between the embossing roll and a smooth
resilient roll or rubber roll which form a nip for embossing
film.JP-B-45014198 discloses a method of forming cylindrical
synthetic resin wrappers using an apparatus which comprises

A method of forming a surface of a thermoplastic
film (1) with a nonwoven fabric-like pattern defined by many

individual fibers intertwined at random, said method
comprising the step of applying a heat-softened

thermoplastic film (1) to a patterned molding surface (6) of
a molding assembly (3) so as to form a surface of said film

(1) with a pattern in conformity to said pattern of said
molding surface (6), characterised in that said molding

surface (6) is formed by a nonwoven fabric-like layer (21)
comprising individual metal fibers intertwined at random,

said nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) being air-permeable in
the direction of its thickness and being supported from the

underside thereof by an air-permeable support member (20),
and in that a suction means (10,25) is applied to exert a

vacuum effect on the nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) from
the upper side to the underside thereof, thereby forming the

surface of said film (1) with said pattern in conformity to
the pattern on the upper side of the nonwoven fabric-like

layer (21) under said vacuum effect.
A method of forming a surface of a thermoplastic
film (1) with a nonwoven fabric-like pattern defined by many

individual fibers intertwined at random, said method
comprising the steps of applying a heat-softened

thermoplastic film (1) to a patterned molding surface (6) of
a molding assembly (3) and applying squeezing means (30)

face to face with said molding surface (6) and cooperating
with said molding surface (6) to squeeze said t
hermoplastic
film (1) therebetween so as to form a surface of said film

(1) with a pattern in conformity to said pattern of said
molding surface (6), characterized in that said molding

surface (6) is formed by a nonwoven fabric-like layer (21)
comprising individual metal fibers intertwined at random and

supported by a support member (20) from the underside
thereof, such that the surface of said film (1) is formed 

with said pattern in conformity to the pattern on the upper
side of the nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) under the

squeezing effect.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein
thermoplastic fibers less than 50% by weight are mixed and

welded to the metal fibers of said nonwoven fabric-like
layer (21).
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
metal fibers have an average diameter of 10 to 400Âµm.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
the metal fibers have a length of 15 to 200mm.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) has a weight per unit

area of 80 to 2000g/m
2
.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) has a thickness of 3 to

10mm.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said nonwoven fabric-like layer (21) comprises a card web or

felt made of metal staples or filaments.
