<ABSTRACT>
An electrical power-assisted steering system is disclosed comprising a brushless electric motor (1) which has a plurality of phase windings connected at a star point and in which a switching means (13) such as a relay is provided in at least one phase of the motor, the switching means being movable between a closed position in which current is able to flow in the phase winding and an open position which prevents current flowing in the respective phase in the event of a fault. Also disclosed is a substantially rigid connector assembly (19) onto which is mounted the switching means (13), conductors (20) for connecting the motor phase windings and a motor position sensor (21) to an associated motor control means (6), the connector acting as a support for the motor stator, which simplifies the steps involved in assembly. In another aspect of the invention, the electrical power assisted steering system includes a one-piece casing (3) which acts as a housing for the gearset, torque sensor, control means and at least part of the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRICAL POWER-ASSISTED STEERING SYSTEMSThis invention relates to an electrical power-assisted steering system for a vehicle of the kind comprising an electric motor connected through a gearbox to act on a steering mechanism of the vehicle. For example, the gearbox may provide a connection between the motor and a steering column shaft, or directly onto a portion of a rack and pinion mechanism forming part of the steering mechanism.The electric motor is used to assist a driver in applying torque to the steering mechanism, by applying an assistance torque of the same sense, to make it easier to turn the steering wheel, for example during parking manoeuvres. Thus, operation of the motor may assist in rotating the steering column shaft, or moving a portion of the steering rack mechanism. Of course, the motor may be connected to any part of any typical steering mechanism as long as it can provide an assistance torque to aid the driver in turning the steering wheel.The motor, which may be a multi-phase brushless star-connected permanent magnet motor, is controlled by motor control means comprising control and drive circuits, which is operative to supply a current from a power supply to the motor phase windings. The phase windings of the motor are connected at a star point. Each phase is connected to a positive terminal of the power supply by a top transistor, and to a negative terminal by a bottom transistor, the two transistors defining an arm of a multiple arm bridge. This bridge forms the drive circuits, while the control circuits are provided by a microprocessor or digital signal processor or analogue signal processing or some combination thereof. The microprocessor is operative in response to signals from a torque sensor provided on the steering column to measure 

the torque applied by the driver, from a motor rotor position sensor providing information about motor speed and direction and optionally from signals corresponding to current flowing in the motor bridge or power supply. This information can be used in combination with the torque sensor signal and/or column position sensor signal to determine which phase winding should be energised and when. The microprocessor produces control signals which energise the transistors of the drive circuits to cause current to flow in a desired motor phase.A problem with this electrical power-assisted steering system is that a fault occurring in the motor drive or control circuits can cause an error condition which is unacceptable in a vehicle steering system,
