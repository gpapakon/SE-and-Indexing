<ABSTRACT>
A heating device for a practice target, which is heated in order to produce a thermal image with the aid of a heat source which produces a gaseous heated medium, the heat source being initiated and/or interrupted by means of a control device, at least one pyrotechnic charge which produces hot gas being used as the heat source 2, and it being possible to influence the thermal capacity and/or burning duration of the pyrotechnic charge by means of its size and/or shape.

<CLAIMS>
Process for heating a practice target (1) which serves to generate 
a heat image with the aid of a heat source (2) which generates a 

gaseous heated medium. and the heat source is initiated and/or 
interrupted by means of a control mechanism, 
characterized in 
that
at least one pyrotechnic set which generates a heating gas is 
used as heat source (2); 
the pyrotechnic set can be influenced with respect to heat 
capacity and/or duration of combustion by way of its size and/or 

form; and 
the control mechanism (3) comprises a recharging mechanism 
(7) for a plurality of pyrotechnic propellants (2) which positions 

the individual sets under a respective pitot pipe (5). 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
pyrotechnic propellant is applied in solid, paste or liquid form. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the control 
mechanism (3) is mechanically and/or electrically driven and 

operates remote-controlled and/or with an internal process control. 
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the control of 
the reloading device (7) is carried out sequentially and/or by 

random selection of individual propellants (2).
