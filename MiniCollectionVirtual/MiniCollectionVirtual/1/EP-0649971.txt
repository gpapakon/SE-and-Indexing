<ABSTRACT>
Bevel gear drive, characterised in that it comprises a support (cradle) (1) formed by two parallel sides which are joined together by two curved walls (4, 5), the inner faces (7) of the said sides additionally being provided with recesses (9) allowing the movement of a casing (10) comprising housings (14, 14') through which is positioned a set of gear wheels comprising at each of their ends (21, 22, 24) a meshing zone and a rod (26) which enable a connection to be made between the winch shaft of the roller shutter drum (30) and the operating shaft (29), the said support (1) being secured to the wall face via a base (33) which acts as a support.

Bevel gear drive for roller shutter, characterized in that it 
comprises a cradle (1) formed of two parallel flanks (2, 3) 

connected together by two curved walls (4, 5), the inner faces 
(7, 8) of said flanks being equipped also with recesses (9) 

permitting the movement of a housing (10) comprising seatings 
(14, 14'), by means of which a gear train (20) is positioned, 

the gears comprising, at each of their ends (21, 22, 24, 25), an 
engagement zone (23) and a rod (26) making possible connection 

to the axis of the winch of the drum (30) of the roller shutter 
and to the operating axis (29), said cradle (1) cooperating with 

the wall face by means of a base (33) forming a support. 
Bevel gear drive for roller shutter according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the recesses (9) present, respectively, on 

the lateral faces (7, 8) of the cradle (1) and (11, 12) of the 
housing (10) are of a similar profile, notably plane or 

spherical. 
Bevel gear drive for roller shutter according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it is arranged to 

provide these seatings (14, 14') at an open angle comprised 
between a right angle and the straight angle greater than the 

right angle, such as notably 120Â°. 
Bevel gear drive for roller shutter according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the openings (31, 32) 

present in the curved walls (4, 5) and which make possible the 
passage of the seatings (14, 14') are of a slightly larger 

diameter and may, if necessary, be of oblong shape. 
Bevel gear drive for roller shutter according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the support (33) is 

provided with a plurality of holes (36, 37) for the passage, on  
 

the one hand, of a gear train (20) and, on the other hand, for 
the fixing means such as screws, for the support (33) to the 

wall. 
Bevel gear drive for roller shutter according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that there is interposed, 

between the support (33) and the cradle (1), a slider (41), the 
female part being, if desired, disposed on the flank (35) of the 

support (33) and the male part on one of the outer faces of the 
cradle (1), the slider (41) possessing a plurality of guide 

surfaces, thus limiting the degrees of freedom of the cradle (1) 
on the support (33) to a single direction. 
Bevel gear drive for roller shutter according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it is arranged that one 

of the holes (36, 37) disposed in the base (33) and making 
possible the passage of the gear train (20) is sufficiently 

large, or is made in the form of an oblong opening, to permit 
the angular travel of the cradle (1) on the support (33) between 

a high position and a low position.
