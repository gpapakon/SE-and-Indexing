<ABSTRACT>
A circuit (10) for producing signals representative 
of at least two flame current levels is disclosed herein. 

The circuit (10) includes two electrodes (12, 14) 
locatable in a flame (16), where a voltage potential is 

set up between the electrodes (12, 14), and the current 

flow is measured therebetween (flame current). The 
circuit (10) includes an amplifying portion (24, 42) for 

amplifying the flame current and applying a signal to a 
microprocessor (38). The microprocessor (38) samples the 

signal and outputs a signal representative of the flame 
current level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to devices 
designed to determine whether or not a flame, such as the 
flame of a pilot light, is present in a flame area. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to sensing 
the current conducted through a flame area to determine 
whether or not the current conducted is indicative of the 
presence of a flame. Many appliances, such as furnaces, use pilot lights 
for igniting the main burner of the appliance. For 
example, in a high efficiency furnace, a pilot light or 
igniting flame is ignited by a spark or electrically 
heated ignitor in response to a request for heat signal 
from a thermostat. This igniting flame provides the 
energy to ignite the fuel (e.g., natural gas) and air 
mixture at the combustion chamber of the furnace. 
However, it is important that the igniting flame is 
present before the fuel valve of the furnace is opened to 
provide fuel to the combustion chamber. Thus, the 
control system for the fuel valve must include a system 
for ensuring that an igniting flame is present when 
required to ignite the fuel-air mixture at the combustion 
chamber.  
 One way to sense the presence of a flame is to 
provide a voltage potential between two electrodes (e.g., 
flame hood and electrode near the tip of the flame), both 
located within a flame area (the area occupied by the 
ionized gases of a flame when a flame is present). The 
current flow within the flame area between the electrodes 
is monitored and will exceed a certain threshold when a 
flame is present due to the conductivity of the ionized 
gases in the flame area. By way of example, a typical 
furnace would apply 24 volts to the electrodes and a 
current of 50 or more nanoamps would indicate that a 
flame is present. Electronics for accurately sensing currents in the 
range of 50 nanoamps can be relatively sensitive, since 
noise can substantially influence such sensing. 
Furthermore, circuits for flame current sensing in 
furnaces must be fail-safe for safety reasons. 
Accordingly, to provide reasonably priced fail-safe 
circuits for sensing flame current, circuits have been 
produced which only give a binary signal (flame present) 
based upon the presence or absence of a threshold flame 
current. Flame current sensing circuits which only indicate 
that a flame is present or absent fulfill the primary 
need of flame detection; however, these circuits do not 
provide any information about the value of the flame 
current other than that it is above or below a setpoint. For purposes
