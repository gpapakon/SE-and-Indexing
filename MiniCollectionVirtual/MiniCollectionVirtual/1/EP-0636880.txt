<ABSTRACT>
A sensor 13 is inserted into a connector 14. A 
constant voltage required to obtain a response current is 

applied across the connector 14 by a voltage applying source 
15 at timings required. A response current of the sensor 13 

inserted into the connector 14 is converted into a voltage by 
a current-to-voltage converter 16, and the amount thereof is 

determined by a microcomputer, the analysis results being 
displayed onto a display unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a quantitative
analyzer for measuring such as a glucose level of biological
fluid, particularly body fluid.Various biosensors utilizing a specific catalytic
action possessed by enzymes have recently been developed and
applied, in particular, to clinical field. Development of
biosensors having an ability of providing rapid and yet
precise analytical results has long been desired in view of
increasing number of samples and increasing number of items
to be tested.Diabetes mellitus is a disease from which the
patient can not be completely recovered. However, the patient
can live a normal life by keeping a concentration of glucose
in blood at a normal level. Accordingly, constant retention
of the normal glucose level is essential as a treatment of
diabetes mellitus. The retention of the normal glucose level
may be easily carried out on inpatients under physician's
observation. However, outpatients must conduct self-management
in order to keep their blood glucose at a constant normal
level. Such self-management includes dietary therapy,
ergotherapy, and drug therapy, and the patients usually
conduct the self-management on the above-noted two or more
items under physician's directions. It is reported that when
patients can check by themselves if their blood glucose level
analytical results of glucose level in blood is within normal
range or not, the self-management can be more effective.In the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus (IDDM), normal blood glucose level is maintained
through repeated insulin-injections effected by patients
themselves. However, the blood glucose level varies rapidly
and considerably depending on caloric intake, dietary time,
and injection time, and therefore, it is essential that the
patients conduct the measurement of the glucose level by
themselves.Under such circumstances, various portable measurement
systems have long been commercially available, which
enable diabetes patients to conduct the glucose level
measurement by themselves. Blood glucose level is generally
determined using such a conventional measurement system in the
following manner: whole blood which has been taken from a
fingertip or ear lobe using a needle is contacted a test paper
containing an enzyme specifically reacting with glucose and 
a color-producing reagent which develops color based on
oxidation-reduction reaction; thereby the reagent and blood
glucose react together and produce color, thickness of which
is measured using an exclusive mini-reflectometer
