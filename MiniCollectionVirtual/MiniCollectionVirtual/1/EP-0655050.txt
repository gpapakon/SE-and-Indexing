<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR PURIFICATION OF WATER BY FLOCULATION The present invention generally relates to an apparatus, in the following referred to as floculator, for purification of waste water or any other untreated (raw) water, or emulsions or mixtures of water and oil or oil-like products by a floculation method, and the invention is more particularly concerned with such an apparatus which comprises a container having an inlet for untreated water and an outlet for floculated water, and which has or not has means for stirring of the water during its passage through the floculation container, and which apparatus is simple and effective, has small dimensions, which can be connected to practically any existing purification plant or another equipment, which as a complete can be operated by one single motor and which can be manufactured at low cost.FLOCULATIONUnder favourable electrostatic conditions it is possible, by stirring the water, to make microscopically small particles grow to particle aggregates, generally referred to as floes, of such size that the said aggregates may flotate of sediment. For making the the particle aggregates build up to floes which can be separated it is necessary that the stirring is arranged so that the shearing forces do not become so high that the growing floes break. Normally this has been achieved by directing the masses of water under decreasing stirring speeds through a series of successive floculation chambers, generally 2-4 chambers. Since there are only 2-4 stirring speed levels there will be a coarse control of the floe growth. Irrespective of the size of the particle aggregates said floes are subjected to the same stirring intensity. When a plant is being dimensioned the considerations are based on a balancing between a quick groowth of the floes and the size of the floes. It is posible by a so called tube floculation to provide a quick and very effective floculation. By said method the particle containing water is passed through a tube in a predetermined speed, whereby the floculation follows spontaneously depending on the turbulence which appears in the tube and which is momentarily and uniformly distributed throughout the water mass. The method is disadvantageious in that an optimum floculation follows within a very narrow flow interval.According to the invention there is suggested a floculation apparatus 

comprising a series of concentrically placed floculation chambers which are connected to each other in a special formation, so that the water with the particles

1. Apparatus for purification of waste water and other untreated (raw) water or emulsions or mixtures of water and oil or oil like products by a floculation method, comprising a container (1 ) having an inlet (2) for untreated water and an outlet (3) for floculated water, and in which the floculation container (1 ) contains several concentric intermediate walls (8, 9) therein which define several concentric floculation chambers (10-12) which are substantially closed at the bottom thereof, characterized in that - each intermediate wall (8, 9) and the wall (6) to the outlet (3) is formed with flow openings or slots (13-15) extending along the entire height of the wall or parts thereof,
- and which are arranged so that the flow of water can pass succesively inwards or outwards through the several floculation chambers (10-12) from the inlet (2) to the outlet (3),
- and in that the floculation chambers (10-12) have one or more means (16) for positively directing the flow of water from one floculation chamber (10), through the respective flow opening or slot (13-15) to the succeeding floculation chamber (11) or to the outlet (3) respectively and to positively prevent a flow in a direction which is opposite to the intended flow direction.
2. Apparatus according to claim 1 , characterized in that the means for positively directing the flow of water from one floculation chamber to the succeeding floculation chamber (10-12) is a deflection wall (16) which is arranged substantially transversally of the floculation chamber downstream of and adjacent the flow opening or slot (13-15) of the succeeding floculation chamber, as seen in the flow direction.
3. Apparatus according to claim 2, which is formed with means (4) for stirring the water while the water is passing through the floculation container, and in which the stirring means (4) is driven by a motor (17) for providing an oscillating and/or rotating movement in the respective floculation chamber (10-12), and in which the stirring means comprises one or more stirring rods (19) for each individual floculation chamber (10-12), and in which each stirring rod (19) can be formed with, for instance, one or more paddle blades (20) for incresing the stirring effect and/or with wings (21) mounted along the stirring rods (19) for increasing the turbulence in the flow of water, characterized in that the deflection wall (16) is arranged
