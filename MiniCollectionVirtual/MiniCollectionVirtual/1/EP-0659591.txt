<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for assisting the mounting of a 
tire-wheel assembly (1) onto an axel with high precision 

without eccentrically arranging the assembly from the 
axel, comprises a pair of opposite clasping members 

(11,12) sandwiching the tire-wheel assembly from its 
side surface therebetween, a vibration applying machine 

(14) fixed to one of the clasping members (11), and a 
fastening means (16) for temporarily fastening the 

clasping members at a given position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a 
process for assisting the mounting of a tire-wheel 
assembly onto an axel, and more particularly to an 
apparatus and a process for assisting the mounting of a 
tire-wheel assembly onto an axel which can 
permit the mounting of the tire-wheel assembly onto the 
axel of a vehicle in a short time while precisely 
arranging a center of a rotating axis in the tire-wheel 
assembly with a center of the axel in the vehicle in a 
straight line, and which can contribute to improve 
vibration properties in the running of the vehicle and 
resistance to uneven wear of the 
vehicle tires, and in which it is in particular 
possible to maintain adequately corrected static and dynamic 
unbalancing quantities in the tire-wheel assembly even 
after the assembly is mounted onto the vehicle.  
 US-A-2 792 139 discloses an apparatus according to the preamble 
of claim 1 and a process according to the preamble of claim 8. A known method of mounting a tire-wheel assembly 
onto an axel of a vehicle will be described below 
with reference to Fig. 7 of the accompanying drawings, which comprises 
a one-side section  
 
of a main mounting portion. As shown in Fig. 7, a slight clearance is formed 
in a hub hole (center hole) in a wheel disc portion 3d 
of the tire-wheel assembly (not shown) with respect to a 
cylindrical protrusion 5a in a hub 5 of the axel side, 
so that the tire-wheel assembly is applied onto the hub 
5 by passing plural hub bolts 6 (4-6 bolts in the case of a 
passenger car) equally disposed on the hub 5 at a given 
pitch circle diameter (PCD) through respective bolt 
holes 9 formed in the disc portion 3d at the same PCD. Then, a fastening nut 7 is screwed around each 
of the hub bolts 6 and sufficiently clamped so as to 
fully contact the disc portion 3d to a contacting 
surface 5b of the hub 5 or fully contact a projecting 
portion formed around the bolt hole 9 to the contacting 
surface 5b in the illustrated embodiment, whereby the 
mounting of the tire-wheel assembly onto the axel is 
completed. As shown in Fig. 7, a tip portion of the fastening 
nut 7 mainly used in light vehicles, passenger cars 
and small size trucks has a taper seat 8, while the bolt 
hole 9 of the disc portion 3d has a taper seat having a 
shape corresponding to the shape of the taper seat 8. 
In the clamping of the nut 7, therefore, the taper seat 
of the tip portion of the nut 7 and the taper seat of 
the bolt hole 9 themselves act to exhibit centering  
 
behaviour with respect to each

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10;20) for assisting the mounting of 
a tire-wheel assembly (1) onto an axel, comprising a 

pair of opposite clasping members (11,12;21,22) for 
sandwiching the tire-wheel assembly between its side 

surfaces 
the distance between the clasping members being adjustable, 

characterised by a vibration 
applying machine (14;24) fixed to one of the clasping 

members (11;21), and a fastening means for temporarily 
fastening the clasping members at a position of 

sandwiching the tire-wheel assembly. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that one of the clasping members (11) is provided at 

its end side with a guide hole (13) or a guide groove 
slidably guiding the other clasping member (12) along 

the clasping direction of the tire-wheel assembly. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, characterised 
in that the fastening means is a slide-preventive member 

(16) slidably engaging with an elongate hole (15) formed 
in the clasping member (12) to be guided so as to extend 

in the clasping direction thereof and preventing the 
sliding between mutual clasping members (11,12) at the 

position of sandwiching the tire-wheel assembly. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterised 
in that the slide-preventive member (16) is comprised of 

a sleeve bearing (16-1) provided with a flange contactly  
 

engaging with a peripheral portion of the elongate hole 
(15) and slidably fitting to the elongate hole, a 

cam-shaped member (16-2) provided with a shaft portion 
rotatably supported by the bearing (16-1), a handle 

(16-5) for rotating the cam-shaped member, a nut (16-3) 
fastening the sleeve bearing (16-1) to the clasping 

member (12) and a nut (16-4) fastening the shaft portion 
to the sleeve bearing. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, characterised 
in that the slide-preventive member is comprised of a 

bolt slidably fitting to the elongate hole and a 
nut-shaped member contactly engaging with the peripheral 

portion of the elongate hole. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the pair of the clasping members are a pair of 

arm members (21,22), and one of the arm members (22) is 
fixed to an end portion of a rod member (23) and the 

other arm member (21) is slidably attached to the rod 
member. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, characterised 
in that the fastening means is comprised of a male 

portion (23a) threaded on the rod member (23) and a 
female member (26) engaging with the male portion and 

capable of pushing one of the clasping members at the 
position of sandwiching the tire-wheel assembly. 
A process for assisting the mounting of a 
tire-wheel assembly (1) onto an axel of a vehicle, which 

comprises temporarily and loosely mounting the  
 

tire-wheel assembly onto the axel of the vehicle through 
fastening nuts or wheel bolts, applying a pair of 

opposite clasping members (11,12; 21,22) 
to 

both side surfaces of the tire-wheel assembly, 
the distance between the clasping members being adjustable, 

temporarily fastening the clasping members through a 
fastening means so as to hold an applied state of the 

clasping member to the tire-wheel assembly, characterised in that 
vibration is applied to the clasping members through a vibration 

applying machine (14;24) fixed to one of the clasping 
members (11;21), and successively and completely 

clamping all of the fastening nuts or the wheel bolts 
while vibrating the tire-wheel assembly by the vibration 

applying machine to accurately arrange a center of 
rotating axis of the tire-wheel assembly and a center of 

rotating axis of the vehicle axel in a straight line.
