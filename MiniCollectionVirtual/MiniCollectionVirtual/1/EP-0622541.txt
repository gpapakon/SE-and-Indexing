<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
internal combustion engines and, more particularly, to a 
control circuit for controlling ignition spark in internal 
combustion engines. In a standard ignition control circuit for an 
internal combustion engine, a Darlington transistor is 
typically turned ON which allows current to flow through a 
coil. When a desired current level is reached, the control 
circuit controls current flowing into the base of the 
Darlington transistor to limit the current in the coil. 
Then, at the proper time, the Darlington transistor is 
turned OFF and a flyback voltage appears across the coil, 
which causes a spark to jump across the airgap of a spark 
plug. However, there is a need in the art to provide a 
more efficient control circuit for controlling the ignition 
spark in internal combustion engines. There is also a need 
in the art to provide an ignition control circuit which is 
much simpler than the standard ignition control circuit.  It is, therefore, one object of the present 
invention to provide an ignition control circuit for an 
internal combustion engine. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide an ignition control circuit for controlling the 
ignition spark in an internal combustion engine. It is a further object of the present invention 
to provide a simpler ignition control circuit. To achieve the foregoing objects, the present 
invention is an ignition control circuit for an internal 
combustion engine having at least two spark plugs and two 
coils to provide a spark upon de-energization of the coils. 
The circuit also includes an output circuit connected to 
the coils to regulate current flow to energize the coils 
and a driver circuit connected to the output circuit to 
control the voltage to the output circuit in response to an 
input signal to the driver circuit. One advantage of the present invention is that a 
new and improved ignition control circuit is provided for 
an internal combustion engine. Another advantage of the 
present invention is that an ignition control circuit is 
provided which controls the ignition spark in an internal 
combustion engine. Yet another advantage of the present 
invention is that a much simpler ignition control circuit 
is provided which uses a voltage controlled device rather 
than a current controlled Darlington transistor.  Other objects, features and advantages of the 
present invention will be readily appreciated as the same 
becomes better understood after reading the subsequent 
description
