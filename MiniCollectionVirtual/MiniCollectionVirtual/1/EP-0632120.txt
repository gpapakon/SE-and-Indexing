<ABSTRACT>
The daylight stability, foaming characteristics, colour, engine performance 
test behaviour, oxygenates content, and thermal stability of wax isomerate oils and/or 

hydrocarbon synthesis liquid products are improved by a method comprising 
contacting the aforesaid wax isomerate oil and/or hydrocarbon synthesis liquid 

products with a silica adsorbent, said silica adsorbent being characterized by 
possessing a pore size of at least about 100Å (10 nm), preferably at least about 125Å 

(12.5 nm), most preferably at least about 150Å (15 nm), an alkali/alkaline earth ion 
concentration, excluding sodium, of greater than about 125 ppm, an iron content of 

less than about 40 ppm and a zirconium content of less than about 130 ppm.

<DESCRIPTION>
Wax isomerate oils and/or hydrocarbon synthesis liquid 
products (also known as gas conversion liquid products) which are 
contaminated and thereby have unacceptable thermal stability, oxygenates 
content, color, daylight stability, engine performance test 
results and foaming characteristics can be improved in terms of those 
characteristics by the process involving contacting the oil or liquid 
product with silica which possesses a pore size of at least about 
100Å, an alkali/alkaline earth ion content, excluding sodium, of 
greater than about 125 ppm, an iron content of less than 40 ppm and a 
zirconium content of less than 130 ppm. Lubricating oils produced using wax isomerate oils and/or 
hydrocarbon synthesis liquid products as either the base oil or an 
additive component, must meet strict performance guidelines in terms 
of color, daylight stability, oxygenates content, engine performance 
test results, foaming tendency and thermal stability. The use of wax 
isomerate oils and/or hydrocarbon synthesis liquid products as base 
oils per se or as additive components of formulate lube or specialty 
oils (e.g. transmission fluids, refrigerator oils, electrical oils 
etc.) has associated with such use the necessity of overcoming and/or 
otherwise mitigating or removing certain negative characteristics of 
said oils which hamper or otherwise impede the use of such oils in 
such service. These oils, in the course of manufacture, and/or during 
shipment or storage, pick up significant quantities of oxygenates 
which are detrimental. It has long been known that the presence of oxygenates in oil 
base stocks is to be avoided. The literature describes various 
methods for effecting this desired goal. USP 3,529,944 teaches that a hydrocarbon oil can have its 
oxidation performance improved by the steps of adding an oxidation 
promoter to the oil to produce oxidation products, then filtering the  
 
oil through a solid, particulate, adsorbent media to remove the 
impurities. Suitable adsorbents include in general natural or 
synthetic clays, fuller's earth, attapulgite, silica gel and adsorbent 
catalyst. USP 3,684,684 teaches the production of lube oils stable to 
ultra-violet light and having improved color and viscosity index by 
severe hydrogenation, dewaxing and clay contacting lubricating oil 
fractions. Clay contacting is effected using as the adsorbent agent 
fuller's earth, attapulgite clay, porocel clay, bauxite, silica or 
mixtures thereof. USP 3,671,423 improves the light and air stability of

<CLAIMS>
A method for the production of a lubricating or specialty 
oil resistant to deterioration upon exposure to light, heat and air, 

and which passes engine performance, foaming and color tests, which 
process comprises contacting a hydrocarbon oil selected from wax 

isomerate oil, and hydrocarbon synthesis liquid product and mixtures 
thereof with a silica adsorbent, said silica adsorbent being characterized 

by possessing a pore size of at least 100Å, an alkali/alkaline 
earth ion concentration, excluding sodium, of greater than about 125 

ppm, an iron content of less than about 40 ppm and a zirconium content 
of less than about 130 ppm, said contacting being conducted at a 

silica loading level of greater than about 1 ml/gram, separating the 
oil from the adsorbent and recovering the oil as product for use as 

base oils or additive oils in the production of lube or specialty 
oils. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the silica adsorbent has a 
pore size of at least 125Å, an alkali/alkaline earth ion concentration 

preferably greater than about 150 ppm, an iron content of less than 
about 30 ppm and a zirconium content of less than 115 ppm. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the silica adsorbent has a 
pore size of at least 150Å, an alkali/alkaline earth ion concentration, 

excluding sodium, of greater than about 300 ppm, an iron content 
of less than about 25 ppm and a zirconium content of less than about 

100 ppm. 
The method of claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein the hydrocarbon oil

a simulated moving bed or a magnetically stabilized fluidized bed.
