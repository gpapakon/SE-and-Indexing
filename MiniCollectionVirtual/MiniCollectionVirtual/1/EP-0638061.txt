<DESCRIPTION>
Under normal nutritional and physiological
conditions, fuel requirements of the body are met
primarily by glucose and fatty acid metabolism.
However, during abnormal metabolic stress states
induced by trauma or sepsis, one of the effects is a
decrease of fat and glucose utilization. Under these
conditions, a high rate of bodily protein catabolism
occurs. This metabolic response results in the
acceleration of protein degradation and an elevation
of energy expenditure, or hypercatabolism. Bodily
protein catabolism provides the precursors for
oxidation of branched chain amino acids and the
synthesis and release of alanine for hepatic
metabolism as a gluconeogenic substrate. Urinary
nitrogen excretion is often elevated and the
individual suffers a negative nitrogen balance. If
the stress is persistent, the nitrogen losses will
eventually deplete the individual's protein stores
resulting in a progressive deterioration of lean body
mass and multiple organ failure.Stress of injury in an individual, such as
trauma or sepsis, is often accompanied by total or
partial dysfunction of the gastro-intestinal tract.
These individuals are often hospitalized and must
receive most or all of their daily nutritional
requirements parenterally and/or enterally in order
to sustain protein synthesis and avoid malnutrition.
For example, many patients are administered total 
parenteral nutrition which includes a source of fatty
acids. Standard parenteral nutrition diets have long
chain fatty acid triglyceride (LCT) emulsions,
composed of either soybean or safflower oil, as the
primary lipid source. These oils are high in ω6
fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid.As an alternative or additive fatty acid
source, medium chain triglycerides (MCT) formed from
saturated fatty acids with 6-12 carbon backbones have
been used in various formulations. MCTs are
metabolized more rapidly than long chain
triglycerides in that they enter the body through the
portal rather than lymphatic pathway. Metabolic
products of MCT do not require carnitine to enter
into the mitochondria where they undergo
β-oxidation.One current high protein enteral liquid
nutrition supplement, REPLETE™ (Clintec Nutrition
Company), provides MCTs to minimize diarrhea caused
by fat intolerance. Another formulation for enteral
feedings, IMMUN-AID™ (Kendall McGaw Laboratories,
Inc.), includes both MCTs and canola oil as sources
of fat and is reported to improve immune function in
an immunocompromised, stressed patient. Canola oil
is discussed in the IMMUN-AID™ literature as

<CLAIMS>
Use of an oil for the manufacture of a medicament
for the treatment of catabolic illness and/or infection,

wherein the oil has an ω9 monounsaturated fatty acid as 45-85%
of the total fats in the oil and the monounsaturated

fatty acid provides 10-85% of the total fatty acids in the
medicament.
Use of claim 1, wherein the monounsaturated fatty
acid is an oleic acid.
Use of claim 1, wherein the oil is selected from
the group consisting of olive oil, canola oil, high oleic

acid safflower oil and high oleic acid sunflower oil.
Use of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
the monounsaturated fatty acid is in the form of a

structured lipid containing an ω6-ω12 fatty acid as one of
the residues of the glycerol backbone of the structured

lipid.
Use of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
the medicament is included in a diet where the medicament

provides 5-75% of the total calories in the diet. 
Use according to claim 5, wherein the diet is in
the form of an enteral preparation.
Use according to claim 5, wherein the diet is in
the form of a parenteral preparation containing 1-40% by

weight lipid in water.
Use according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein the medicament is for use in the prophylactic

treatment of catabolic illness and/or infection.
