<ABSTRACT>
A construction (K) for and a method of waterproofing 
a group of wires (3a) of a wiring harness (3) 

inserted through a tubular member (2), the construction (K) 
comprising: a tube (4) which has a closed distal end 

portion (4a) and an open rear end (4b) and is formed, in 
the vicinity of the closed distal end portion (4a), with a 

number of pores; the tube (4) being disposed at a 
substantially central portion of the wires (3a) of the 

wiring harness (3); and pourable sealing compound (7) which 
is injected into the tube (4) from the open rear end (4b) 

and is extruded from the pores (4c) of the closed distal 
end portion (4a) so as to be filled into gaps among the 

wires (3a) of the wiring harness (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction 
for and a method of waterproofing a wiring harness inserted 
through a tubular member such as a grommet. In a motor vehicle, when a wiring harness is 
provided so as to pass through a panel separating an engine 
room and a cabin from each other, a grommet made of rubber 
is fitted into a through-hole formed on the panel and the 
wiring harness is inserted through the grommet such that 
penetration of water into the cabin is prevented. The grommet is of substantially a shape of a 
frustum of cone and has a large diameter portion and a 
tubular portion extending from a reduced diameter end of 
the large diameter portion. Meanwhile, a panel mounting 
portion is provided on an outer peripheral surface of the 
large diameter portion of the grommet so as to be brought 
into engagement with an inner peripheral edge of the 
through-hole of the panel. A gap between the grommet and 
the through-hole of the panel is sealed positively so as to 
be waterproofed. Thus, the wiring harness is inserted from 
the tubular portion into the large diameter portion so as 
to be passed through the grommet. If gaps exist among wires of the wiring harness 
passed through the grommet and between each of the wires 
and the tubular portion of the grommet, water may penetrate  
 
from the engine room into the cabin through these gaps. 
Therefore, these gaps are also required to be sealed. Various waterproof constructions for sealing 
these gaps are known. For example, Japanese Utility Model 
Laid-Open Publication Nos. 1-66713 (1989) and 2-115221 
(1990) disclose an arrangement in which pourable sealing 
compound is filled into the grommet from the large diameter 
portion so as to be penetrated into the gaps. Meanwhile, 
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. 4-23812 
(1992) discloses an arrangement in which by employing an 
elastic cap having a plurality of holes for inserting the 
wires of the wiring harness therethrough, respectively, the 
elastic cap is fitted, in a state where the wires of the 
wiring harness have been, respectively, inserted through 
the holes of the elastic cap, into the tubular portion of 
the grommet and then, pourable sealing compound is filled 
from the large diameter portion up to inside of the elastic 
cap. However, in the former known waterproof construction 
referred to above, unless the pourable sealing compound 
has a low viscosity of, for example, not more than 
100 poise, the pourable sealing compound is less likely to 
penetrate into gaps

A waterproof construction (K) for a group of 
wires (3a) of a wiring harness (3) inserted through a 

tubular member (2), comprising: 

a tube (4) which has a closed distal end portion 
(4a) and an open rear end (4b) and is formed, in the 

vicinity of the closed distal end portion (4a), with a 
number of pores (4c); 
the tube (4) being disposed at a substantially 
central portion of the wires (3a) of the wiring harness 

(3); and 
pourable sealing compound (7) which is injected 
into the tube (4) from the open rear end (4b) and is 

extruded from the pores (4c) of the closed distal end 
portion (4a) so as to be filled into gaps among the wires 

(3a) of the wiring harness (3). 
A waterproof construction (K) as claimed in Claim 
1, wherein the tubular member is a grommet (2) having a 

large diameter portion (2a) mounted on a panel (1) and a 
tubular portion (2c) extending from a reduced diameter end 

(2b) of the large diameter portion (2a) such that the 
pourable sealing compound (7) filled into the gaps among 

the wires (3a) of the wiring harness (3) is disposed in an 
area of the grommet (2) ranging from the tubular portion 

(2c) to the reduced diameter end (2b) of the large diameter 
portion (2a).  

 
A method of waterproofing a group of wires (3a) 
of a wiring harness (3) inserted through a grommet (2) 

having a large diameter portion (2a) mounted on a panel (1) 
and a tubular portion (2c) extending from a reduced diameter 

end (2b) of the large diameter portion (2a), comprising 
the steps of: 


setting at a substantially central portion of the 
wires (3a) of the wiring harness (3) a tube (4) which has 

a closed distal end portion (4a) and an open rear end (4b) 
and is formed, in the vicinity of the closed distal end 

portion (4a), with a number of pores (4c); 
inserting the wiring harness (3) from the large 
diameter portion (2a) of the grommet (2) into the tubular 

portion (2c) through the reduced diameter end (2b) so as to 
dispose the closed distal end portion (4a) of the tube (4) 

at the tubular portion (2c) of the grommet (2); and 
injecting pourable sealing compound (7) into the 
tube (4) from the open rear end (4b) so as to extrude the 

pourable sealing compound from the pores (4c) such that the 
pourable sealing compound (7) is filled into gaps among the 

wires (3a) of the wiring harness (3).
