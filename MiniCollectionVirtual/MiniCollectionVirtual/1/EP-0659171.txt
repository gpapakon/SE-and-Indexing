<ABSTRACT>
A method and a mixture for chemically stabilizing electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) by entrapping the metals inherent in EAFD within a cementitiously hardened product from the mixture. The method includes using the pozzolanic characteristics of EAFD and forming a mixture of EAFD with sufficient water and lime, as necessary, and then allowing the mixture to react to form a cementitiously hardened product. The hardened product has acceptable leachate concentrations, permeability characteristics and unconfined compressive strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method and a 
mixture for stabilizing electric arc furnace dust (EAFD). 
In particular, this invention pertains to entrapping the 
metals inherent in EAFD within a cementitiously hardened 
product from the mixture. The electric arc furnace (EAF) process is a 
common steel making practice in use today. In a typical 
EAF process, solid charge ingredients including raw 
scrap, limestone, burnt lime, iron ore and ferro-alloy 
additives are placed in the top-charge furnace unit. A conventional furnace unit is equipped with 
(1) a roof lift and swing arrangement which permits the 
roof to swing aside when cold scrap is charged into the 
furnace; (2) a rocker and rail tilting type arrangement  
 
which permits the furnace to tilt forward for tapping and 
backward for slagging; (3) a system for additions through 
the furnace roof; and (4) evacuation systems for the 
removal of dust generated during the steel making cycle. Electrodes are supported by electrode arms and 
clamps, and project from overhead down through the 
furnace roof. An electric arc surging between the 
electrodes and through the furnace charge, typically 
comprising largely scrap metal, produces heat which melts 
the charge and refines the steel. The molten steel is 
tapped, typically at about 1650°C (3000°F), into a ladle and cast 
into blooms or poured into ingot molds. In such a process, particulate emissions are 
generated during (1) charging of scrap, (2) tapping of 
furnaces, (3) pneumatic injection of additives, (4) 
oxygen blowing, and (5) meltdown/refining periods. This 
particulate, which is individually and collectively 
referred to as electric arc furnace dust (hereinafter 
EAFD), is typically collected either as a dry waste in 
baghouses, or wet, as sludge. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has 
classified EAFD as EPA Hazardous Waste No. K061 (emission 
control dust/sludge from the primary production of steel 
in electric furnaces). EAFD contains such hazardous 
constituents as lead, cadmium, and chromium. In order to 
remove EAFD from the list of hazardous wastes, it must be 
transformed into a product which does not exceed the 
following leachate concentration limits (based on the 
Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) as 
found in Appendix II of 40 C.F.R. § 261 :
