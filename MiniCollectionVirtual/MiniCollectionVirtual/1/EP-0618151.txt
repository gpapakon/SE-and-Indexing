<ABSTRACT>
2.1. Hinged-lid boxes are a customary form of packaging for cigarettes or similar objects (29). Owing to the cuboid shape of the packaging, the objects adjoin at the top and bottom in each case in one plane, which makes removal of the objects difficult. 2.2. To improve the possibilities of removal, the bottom (14) of the package is designed to be sloping. The cigarettes (29) respectively standing on the bottom are thus offset in height relative to one another.
