<DESCRIPTION>
 DELTA OPIOID RECEPTOR-SELECTIVE BENZYLIDENE-SUBSTITUTED MORPHINANS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL ABUSEBackground of the InventionThis invention was made with the assistance of the Government under a grant from the Public Health Service (Grant No. DA 01533). The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.The use of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitors is one pharmacotherapeutic approach which has been employed for the treatment of alcohol (ethanol) abuse and alcoholism. Examples of these types of compounds presently used clinically are disulfiram (tetraethylthiura disulfide) (Antabuse ) , and carbimide (citrated calcium carbimide, cyanamide (Temposil )) . Disulfiram is used throughout the world, whereas calcium carbimide has not been approved by the FDA for use in the United States.The rationale for the use of ALDH inhibitors such as disulfiram for the treatment of alcoholism is that they block the metabolism of ethanol. Thus, after ethanol ingestion, inhibitors of liver mitochondrial low Km ALDH cause an increase in the formation of acetaldehyde. Clinically, this leads to tachycardia, hypotension, nausea, and other adverse symptoms that are referred to as the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER) . Although disulfiram is widely used in the treatment of alcoholism, its use is not without controversy. A number of reports have questioned disulfiram's toxicity and its ability to produce a DER that is effective to deter ethanol ingestion. Endogenous opioid peptides are involved in the mediation or modulation of a variety of mammalian physiological processes, many of which are mimicked by opiates or other non-endogenous opioid ligands. Some of the effects that have been investigated are analgesia, tolerance and dependence, appetite, renal function, gastrointestinal motility, gastric secretion, learning 

and memory, mental illness, epileptic seizures and other neurological disorders, cardiovascular responses, and respiratory depression.The fact that the effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids are mediated by at least three different types [mu (μ) , delta (δ)Λ kappa (K) ] of opioid receptors raises the possibility that highly selective exogenous opioid agonist or antagonist ligands might have therapeutic applications. See .R. Martin, Pharmacol. Rev., 35, 283 (1983). Thus, if a ligand acts at a single opioid receptor type or subtype, the potential side effects mediated through other opioid receptor types can be minimized or eliminated.The prototypical opioid antagonists, naloxone and naltrexone,
