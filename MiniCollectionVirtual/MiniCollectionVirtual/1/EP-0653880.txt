<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus which converts R, G, B color signals into Y, Cr, Cb 
signals and reconverts them into R, G, B signals, compensates 

converted Y signals in order to confine each component of R, G, B 
color signals to be reconverted in a dynamic range allowable for 

them. 
It is not necessary to provide time consuming processes for 
checking and compensating reconverted R, G, B color signals and total 

time required for reconversion is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for converting and
reconverting color signals between two different color spaces, and
more particularly to an apparatus where reconverted color signals
are confined in their allowed dynamic ranges when, for example,
R, G, B color signals are converted into corresponding Y, Cr, Cb color
signals, subjected to data compression and data decompression, and
reconverted into R, G, B color signals.Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of this invention,
which will be used for describing a prior art.CPU 1 converts color signals according to the program stored
beforehand in control ROM 2 using control RAM 3 as a working memory.
Color signals in R, G, B color space are input and stored temporarily
in control RAM 3 and converted into corresponding signals in
Y, Cr, Cb color space by the conversion program. Converted color
signals are registered in a filing device 4 after compressed by a
picture data compressor 5. Picture data to be displayed on a display
8 are read out from the filing device 4, decompressed by a picture
data decompressor 6 and are reconverted into corresponding color
signals in R, G, B color space by the reconversion program. The
reconverted R, B, G color signals are stored in a frame buffer memory
7 to be displayed on the display 8.Conversion of color signals in R, G, B color space into
corresponding signals in Y, Cr, Cb color space or reconversion vice
versa should be completed in a high speed.As prior arts developed for this purpose, there are Japanese 
patents laid open as preliminary patent publication No. 210771/'84
(hereafter called the first prior art) and No. 288684/' 92 (hereafter
called the second prior art).As for conversion and reconversion of color signals between
R, G, B color space and Y, Cr, Cb color space, following formula (1)
and formula (2) are applied.
It takes, however, a lot of time to convert and reconvert color
signals by calculating these formulas.To eliminate these calculations, conversion tables are used as
shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, 1a, 1b, and 1c are input terminals of R,
G and B signal, 4a, 4b, and 4c are output terminals of Y, Cr, and Cb
signal, and 3a, 3b and 3c are corresponding conversion tables, for
example.Conversion or reconversion tables as shown in Fig. 7, however,
need a lot of memory.When R, G, B, Y, Cr and Cb signals have digital values of 8
bits, for example, table 3a has addresses of 24 bits (224) and data
in each address needs 8 bits and so total amount of memory for table 
3a, 3b and 3c require 402653184
