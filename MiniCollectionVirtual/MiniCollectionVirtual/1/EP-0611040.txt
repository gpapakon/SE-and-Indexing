<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elongate 
electroluminescent light strip and to a continuous 
method of making such a strip. More particularly, but 
not exclusively, the present invention relates to 
elongate electroluminescent light strips useful as 
mouldings for vehicles and as building, pathway and 
other light marking strips and to a continuous method 
of making such strips. Electroluminescent lights have been known for many 
years and have been made by using conventional sheet 
lamination techniques to make a laminate structure of 
layers of a phosphor matrix sandwiched between 
electrically conductive layers. Typically, the 
electrically conductive layers include an aluminum foil 
layer and a conductive transparent sheet such as a 
layer of indium tin oxide. The foil can be insulated 
from the phosphor matrix by a dielectric coating. The 
electroluminescent lighting or lamp is often covered 
with a transparent moisture barrier film such as a 
polychlorotrifluoroethylene film. Recently there has been development of 
electroluminescent technology for backlighting 
instruments and computer screens and for ornaments for 
vehicles. Three recent U.S. patents employing 
electroluminescent lamps in association with vehicles 
are Nos. 4,443,832 for "Self-illuminating Ornament for 
Vehicles"; 4,494,326 for "Electroluminescent Display 
Structure for Motor Vehicle Window" and 4,603,065 for 
"Decorative Part." An elongated electroluminescent 
light strip has also been developed and is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,161,797 for "Electroluminescent 
Device." Conventional electroluminescent light techniques 
have encountered several problems. The phosphor matrix 
is extremely sensitive to moisture and one problem  
 
encountered in electroluminescent lamp construction 
relates to the destructive effect which water vapour 
has on the phosphor layer. In a conventional laminate 
construction, a desiccant layer is sometimes used along 
with protective films having low vapour transmission 
rates to increase the longevity of the life of the 
phosphor matrix. The prevention of moisture 
encroachment into the lamp's interior is of paramount 
importance in electroluminescent light construction. 
This is especially true with the electroluminescent 
lamps sealed in an Aclar envelope, especially as, 
typically, the Aclar electroluminescent lamps have wire 
leads which provide a place for moisture to enter the 
lamp. Conventional lights are generally made of 
relatively thin construction with the protective film 
having edges
