<ABSTRACT>
A 4-amino(alkyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxamide compound represented by general formula (I), an isomer thereof, and a 
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, wherein each symbol is as defined in the specification. These substances 

have a remarkable, highly persistent and lowly toxic activity of increasing blood stream in coronary, cerebral, renal and peripheral 
arteries, and are useful as a potent and persistent hypotensive and a drug for preventing and treating diseases of a cardiovascular 

system such as coronary, cerebral, renal and peripheral arteries. Furthermore, they are useful as an antasthmatic, because they 
have activities of inhibiting experimental guinea pig asthma caused by the inhalation of histamine and inhibiting contraction of a 

specimen of an extirpated guinea pig trachea caused by acetylcholine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutically
useful 4-amino(alkyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxamide compounds,
isomers thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition
salts thereof.It is known that one of the causes of hypertentions and
coronary or cerebral circulatory diseases, which constitute a
major social problem as adult diseases, is the abnormal
contraction of smooth muscles and the contraction of smooth
muscles is caused by rise in intracellular concentrations of
calcium ion. The rise of the intracellular concentrations of
calcium ion is caused, for example, 1) through the membrane
potential-dependent calcium channel, 2) by release of calcium
from the intracellular organella where it is stored and 3)
through the receptor-dependent channel, and therefore its
origin is uneven. Further, it is recognized that the excessive
calcium ions induce twitches of the coronary artery and the
cerebrovascular artery and these vascular twitches constitute
one of the causes of angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and
cerebral infarction.Incidentally, the calcium antagonists have been recently
employed for the treatment of hypertension or coronary, cerebral 
and peripheral circulatory diseases. While the calcium
antagonists show antagonistic activity against the membrane
potential-dependent calcium channel, they scarcely show
antagonistic activities against other influx of calcium ion
into the cell and liberation of calcium ion from the storage
organella.As the compounds having intracellular calcium antagonistic
action as well as inhibitory action against membrane potential-dependent
smooth muscle contraction which conventional calcium
antagonists inhibit, WO 90/05723 discloses that certain trans-4-amino(alkyl)-pyridylcarbamoylcyclohexane
compounds, optical
isomers thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition
salts thereof have long-lasting coronary, cerebral and renal
blood flow-increasing actions and are useful as an
antihypertensive agent and an agent for the prevention and
treatment of coronary, cerebral and renal circulartory
diseases.Further prior art documents are EP-A-0 370 498, Chem. Abs. vol.
116, 1992, 151571b and JP-A-1056661.An object of the present Invention is to provide a compound
having a potent and long-lasting blood flow-increasing action
in the coronary, cerebral, renal and peripheral arteries, which
is less toxic than conventional compounds.Under these circumstances, the present inventors have made
intensive studies and found that the 4-amino(alkyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxamide
