<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for adjusting the gripper opening cam (1) of a chain delivery system of a sheet printing machine, comprising an adjusting shaft (4) mounted in the machine frame, a lever arm (7), which can be pivoted about a transverse axis to the adjusting shaft axis and is connected to the gripper opening cam in an articulated manner, and a coupling mechanism for converting the rotation of the adjusting shaft into a lever pivoting movement. In this arrangement, the coupling mechanism comprises a combination of a left-hand/right-hand thread, in which the adjusting shaft can be screwed by means of a spindle thread (12) into a spindle nut (13) arranged fixedly in the frame, and engages with a spindle thread (14) of opposite pitch into a spindle nut (15) connected to the lever arm.

Adjusting device for a gripper opening cam in a 
chain deliverer for sheet delivery in a sheet-fed printing 

machine, in which the grippers arranged on gripper 
carriages of chains guided in endless circulation run up 

against the gripper opening cam (1) to open the grippers 
with a cam ro
ller, comprising a control shaft (4) mounted 
in the machine frame (5), a lever arm (7) which is 

pivotable about an axis transverse to the axis of the 
control shaft and is connected in an articulated manner 

to the gripper opening curve, and a coupling mechanism 
for converting the rotation of the control shaft into a 

pivoting movement of the lever arm, characterized in that 
the coupling mechanism between the control shaft (4) and 

the lever arm (7) comprises a combination of a left-hand 
and a right-hand thread, in which the control shaft (4) 

can be screwed by means of a spindle thread (12) into a 
spindle nut (13) arranged fixed to the frame and engages 

by means of a spindle thread (14) of opposite pitch in a 
spindle nut (15) connected to the lever arm (7). 
Adjusting device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the spindle nut (15) connected to the lever 

arm (7) is connected so as to be movable relative to the 
arm (7) about an axis parallel to its pivot axis (8). 
Adjusting device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that, with a rotation of the control 

shaft of about 350°, the thread pitch corresponds to the 
adjusting path of the gripper opening cam (1). 
Adjusting device according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that analogue indicating means (19, 20) 

for setting the gripper opening cam (1) are connected to  
 

the control shaft (4). 
Adjusting device according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that stop means (17, 18), which bound 

the angle of rotation of the control shaft to less than 
360°, are provided on the control shaft (4). 
Adjusting device according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the lever arm (7) connected to the 

one spindle nut (15) and a lever arm (9) connected to the 
gripper opening cam (1) form an angle lever and are 

attached to a shaft (8) which is mounted in the machine 
housing (5) with its axis transverse to the conveying 

direction of the sheet.
