<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine
methyl ester (hereinafter referred to as α-APM),
more particularly, to a significantly improved process for producing
α-APM by solid-liquid separation of the aqueous suspension thereof.α-APM obtained according to the present invention is
expected to be widely utilized as a low caloric dietary sweetener
which is about 200 times as sweet as sugar.For industrial production of α-APM, following processes are
known:
(1) a process which comprises coupling N-protected L-aspartic
anhydride with L-phenylalanine methyl ester in an organic solvent,
followed by deprotection (USP No. 3786039),(2) a process wherein α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine is
converted to methyl ester thereof in a mixed solvent consisting of
water, methanol and hydrochloric acid to obtain α-APM
hydrochloride, which is neutralized to obtain α-APM (Japanese
Patent Application Laid-open No. 82752-1978), and(3) a process which comprises condensing N-protected L-aspartic
anhydride with phenylalanine methyl ester in the presence
of an enzyme, followed by deprotection (Japanese Patent Publication
No. 135595-1980).Any of these processes are generally carried out with a
crystallization step for purification. For example, in the chemical
synthesis such as the above process (1), as for means to selectively
remove impurities including β-isomer (β-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine
methyl ester), which is an inevitably obtained by-product, a process 
is known wherein α-APM containing impurities is contacted with
hydrohalogenic acid to crystallize the product as a hydrohalide salt.
Hydrohalide salts of α-APM obtained in the form of wet crystals are
subsequently dissolved or suspended in an aqueous solvent which is
neutralized by adding a base to separate α-APM as wet crystals. For
further purification, the crystals of α-APM obtained may sometimes
be redissolved and recrystallized. These operations may be carried
out by a continuous process or a batch process. An optional
recrystallization step may be carried out. The final product is usually a
dried product. Such dried product is generally obtained by drying the
wet crystals after the last crystallization.The aforementioned various operations for crystallization may
be generally conducted in a crystallization tank accompanied with
forced flow such as stirring or external circulation. When α-APM
is crystallized under forced flow, it is known that solid-liquid
separation and dehydration properties of the resulting
suspension are extremely
