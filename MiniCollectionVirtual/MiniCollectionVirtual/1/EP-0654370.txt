<ABSTRACT>
A system for preventing fogging in air conditioning 
systems is disclosed. The system employs a strategy whereby if 

fogging conditions are present, the temperature of the 
evaporator is stepped downwardly in increments which allow the 

surface of the evaporator to stabilize thereby eliminating 
localized cold spots. 
The method includes determining if the prime mover or engine has 
begun rotating after a period of nonuse and determining if the pump or 

compressor has recently circulated refrigerant through the evaporator. 
In a preferred embodiment, lowering the temperature of the evaporator 
at a controlled rate includes firstly, lowering the temperature of the 

evaporator by a first incremental amount, then secondly, lowering the 
temperature of the evaporator by a second incremental amount wherein the 

first incremental amount is greater than the second incremental amount.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to climate
control systems, and more particularly relates to a
method of controlling fogging in an air conditioning
system and an apparatus for carrying out the method.Air conditioning systems of the type typically
employed in vehicles, utilize a heat exchanger (sometimes
referred to an evaporator) to cool the air within the passenger
compartment of the vehicle. The evaporator includes one or more
internal passages for allowing the flow of refrigeration fluid
therethrough. Air is passed over an outside surface of the
evaporator and the heat from the air is transferred to the
refrigeration fluid as it passes through and evaporates within
the evaporator. The refrigerant is forced through the
evaporator by a refrigerant pump, commonly referred to as a
compressor. The compressor is typically coupled to the engine
by way of a belt drive and an electric clutch. The electric
clutch engages the compressor to the engine when an electric
current is applied to the clutch and disengages the compressor
from the engine when the electric current ceases to flow through
the clutch. Thus, the electric clutch forms a convenient means
of engaging and disengaging the compressor.A temperature sensing device is typically located on
the surface of the evaporator to sense the temperature of the
evaporator. This temperature information is used to control the
compressor clutch so that the temperature of the evaporator can
be controlled.Various control schemes are known for controlling
the temperature of the evaporator. One control scheme for 
controlling the temperature of the evaporator involves cycling the compressor clutch on and
off as the sole means of controlling evaporator temperature. Systems that employ this type
of control scheme have a problem known as fogging. Fogging involves the expelling of
visible water vapor from the ventilation system of the vehicle. Fogging occurs when the dew
point temperature of the air passing through the evaporator is reached. This can occur at
localized portions of the evaporator if these locations are sufficiently cold, or it can occur
if the evaporator, as a whole is too cold.In the case where the localized cold spots are responsible for causing
fogging, this typically occurs when the compressor is first turned on after a relatively long
period of not operating. Under these conditions, refrigerant flows through the evaporator,
rapidly cooling its various surfaces and causing its surfaces to cool at different rates. As has
been already explained,
