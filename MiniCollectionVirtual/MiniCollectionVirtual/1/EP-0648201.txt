<ABSTRACT>
An enantioselective method for the catalytic hydrogenation of the secondary alcohol function ketone C=O bond. The method uses a neutral ruthenium complex as the catalyst and a compound with a C=O functionality as the substrate to be hydrogenated, and is characterized in that it includes the hydrogenation of the substrate of a diallyl compound of (diphosphino)ruthenium of formula (I), wherein al is preferably CH2CH=CH2 or CH2C(CH3)=CH2, Q is a hydrocarbon bridge with at least two catenary carbon atoms and possibly 1-4 catenary heteroatoms selected from O, S, N and Si, and each of R1-R4, which are the same or different, is a C1-18 alkyl, C5-7 cycloalkyl or C6-12 aryl group.
