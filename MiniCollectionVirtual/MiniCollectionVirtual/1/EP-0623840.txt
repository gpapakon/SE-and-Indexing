<ABSTRACT>
The hybrid colour photography printing system utilizes 
a photographic printing machine of the type comprising 

an optical projection system (GO) and an electronic 
reproduction system (GE) installed together in a single 

unit, designed to generate respective images (FO, FE) 
for transfer to a sheet of light-sensitive paper (7); 

following exposure, the light-sensitive paper (7) is 
treated chemically and dried to produce a colour print. 

In the hybrid system, images (FO) of optical origin and 
images (FE) of electronic origin are projected onto a 

single sheet of light-sensitive paper (7), and with a 
simple modification to the operation of the optical 

projection system (GO) consisting in the interposition 
of a mask (81 or 82) with opaque areas (81a, 81b or 

82a, 82b) of given shape and dimensions, placed over 
the film (2) bearing the image (FO) or over the sheet 

of light-sensitive paper (7), it becomes possible to 
leave selected areas (71, 72) of the paper unexposed; 

these same areas will receive corresponding images (FE) 
reproduced with the electronic system (GE), thereby 

completing the composition of the hybrid image that 
appears ultimately in the photograph.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hybrid system for 
the production of photographic colour prints, whereby 
the complete image of a colour photograph is obtained 
as a composite print by projecting images both from 
photographic film and from digitally encoded sources 
onto a discrete strip of light-sensitive paper. The art field of photography embraces the production of 
colour prints by projecting images from photographic 
film onto suitable light-sensitive paper, a process 
carried out automatically by purpose-built photographic 
printing machines of conventional embodiment. The prior art also embraces integrated systems, known 
as "minilabs", composed of a printing unit, a print 
developing unit and in some cases a film developing 
unit, all fully automatic in operation, in which the 
images recorded on photographic film are projected by a 
suitable optical assembly onto corresponding discrete 
lengths of a strip of light-sensitive paper decoiled 
from a roll and positioned on a printing surface. After 
being exposed, the discrete strips of light-sensitive  
 
paper pass through a succession of chemical treatment 
baths in which the latent images are developed, then 
through a drying enclosure, whereupon the finished 
photographs are deposited in a collection chute. Recent years have witnessed the development, alongside 
the conventional optical projection system outlined 
above, of various systems by which images are formed 
electronically; such images are digitally encoded and 
recorded on a suitable storage medium, then, suitably 
processed, will be reassembled and projected likewise 
onto a relative strip of light-sensitive paper by means 
of a system using one of sundry conventional devices, 
typically cathode ray tubes of whatever type, or Laser 
or Led or liquid crystal devices, in such a way as to 
generate corresponding colour prints. It is acknowledged that the reproduction of images by 
optical projection results in a higher definition and 
therefore a superior level of quality than obtainable 
hitherto with electronic reproduction. Machines have appeared latterly which combine both the 
familiar optical projection unit and the electronic 
image generating unit in a single apparatus, the two 
units operating in conjunction with a single unit that 
decoils and cuts the discrete strips of light-sensitive 
paper for the photographs. This combination type of  
 
machine thus permits of processing colour photographs 
in which the images can be produced using both the 
optical system and the

<CLAIMS>
1) A hybrid colour photography printing system, 
essentially utilizing a photographic printing machine 

of the type comprising two image generating systems in 
a single unit, namely a conventional optical system 

(GO) by which an image (FO) recorded on photographic 
film (2) is projected onto a sheet of light-sensitive 

paper (7), and an electronic system (GE) by which 
digitally encoded images (FE) recorded on a suitable 

storage medium are retrieved and projected likewise 
onto a sheet of light-sensitive paper (7), also means 

by which a sheet of light-sensitive paper (7) bearing a 
printed image (FO, FE) generated by the optical and 

electronic systems is advanced to a group of chemical 
treatment baths in which the latent image is developed, 

thence through a drying chamber, and deposited finally 
as a finished photograph in a collection chute, 

characterized 
in that images of exclusively optical origin (FO) and 

of exclusively electronic origin (FE) are projected 
onto a single sheet of light-sensitive paper (7) in 

such a way as to obtain a composite image (FO+FE), 
created either as a simple superimposition of the two 

images (FO, FE), suitable especially when reproducing 
script and graphics generally, or with the aid of an 

 
interposed mask (81, 82) exhibiting one or more opaque 

areas (81a, 81b; 82a, 83b) of predetermined shape and 
dimensions, utilized preferably in conjunction with the 

optical projection system (GO), which is placed over 
the film (2) bearing the image (FO) for reproduction or 

over the impressionable surface of the sheet of light-sensitive 
paper (7) in such a way as to intercept the 

projected beam of light and thereby generate one or 
more corresponding unexposed areas (71, 72) on the 

sheet of light-sensitive paper (7), destined to receive 
one or more corresponding images (FE) reproduced with 

the electronic system, and thus obtain a photograph 
bearing a hybrid image (FO+FE) composed of portions 

generated with the optical reproduction system (GO) and 
portions generated with the electronic reproduction 

system (GE); and, 
in that the optical and the electronic reproduction 

systems are controlled and monitored and coordinated in 
operation by means of dedicated software. 
2) A system as in claim 1, wherein the mask (81 or 
82) consists in a transparent film exhibiting opaque 

areas (81a, 81b; 82a, 83b) produced by conventional 
means and/or systems such as lithography or similar 

processes. 
3) A system as in preceding claims, wherein the mask 
 

(81 or 82) can be interposed manually or using a device 
piloted to position different masks automatically. 
4) A system as in preceding claims, wherein the image 
(FO) for optical reproduction, with respective masked 

areas if any, is viewed by a television camera placed 
strategically in relation to the film and displayed on 

a video monitor together with the image or images (FE) 
retrieved electronically from the digitally encoded 

source in such a way as to verify the positions of the 
different images one relative to another, and wherein 

the mutual positioning of the two types of image (FO 
and FE) thus displayed is processed and controlled by a 

dedicated software program serving also to pilot the 
operation of devices designed to correct any defects or 

lack of precision in such positioning. 
5) A system as in preceding claims, wherein the 
maximum size of hybrid print obtainable is determined 

by the maximum size of image individually obtainable 
either with the optical reproduction system or with the 

electronic reproduction system.
