<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure sensor particularly useful for measuring 

pressure up to approximately 2000 psi has a hexport (12, 112, 
212, 312) formed with a stop surface (26, 326) in a bottom wall 

(18) circumscribing a fluid pressure inlet (16). A pressure 
sensing module (22) is received on the stop surface and a distal 

end (40) of a wall (20, 120, 320) of the hexport is crimped to 
lock the pressure sensing module onto the stop surface with the 

stop surface limiting the amount of compression of an O-ring (30) 
disposed contiguous to and inboard of the stop surface. In one 

embodiment the crimp is placed directly on a metal ring (38) 
attached to a plastic connector (32) which in turn transfers the 

crimping force to the pressure sensing module. In other 
embodiments (Figs. 2, 3) the crimp is placed directly in the 

pressure sensing module to form a subassembly. In one 
embodiment, a separate sleeve (142) member connects the 

subassembly to the plastic connector while in another embodiment 
the connector is provided with an extended skirt which snaps over 

the hexport to connect the connector to the subassembly. In yet 
another embodiment, the plastic connector (332) is formed with a 

strengthening flange (334) received around the pressure sensing 
module and the crimp is formed directly on the plastic connectors 

to reduce contact stresses in the crimp and compensate for crimp 
wall springback.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fluid pressure sensors
and more particularly to a low cost packaging system for fluid
pressure sensors particularly adapted for use with fluid
pressures in the range of 500 psi to 2000 psi (3450 to 13800 KPa)
or higher.Pressure transducers comprising a pressure sensing module
including an electronic circuit having a variable capacitor
responsive to fluid pressures are known. Examples of such prior
art transducers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,716,492;
4,774,626; 4,888,662; 4,875,135; 4,903,164; 4,982,351 and
5,060,108, assigned to assignee of the present invention. The
electronic circuit senses the capacitance of the capacitor and
provides an output through an electrical connector indicative of
the sensed pressure. The transducer elements are arranged so
that a metallic cup shaped housing having a fluid pressure inlet
at one end thereof to receive fluid under pressure to be measured
also includes therein the pressure sensing module. The pressure
sensing module is spaced from the inlet by a compressible gasket
or O-ring with the electronic circuit and connector suitably
attached to the housing. In Patent No. 4,875,135, the connector
is formed of plastic material to which the housing is attached by
crimping an upstanding wall of the housing over a flange portion
formed on a lower distal end portion of the connector. The
connector is adapted to transfer a force from the crimp through
the pressure sensing module onto an O-ring gasket disposed in the
housing around the fluid pressure inlet to compress the gasket an 
amount determined by the crimp formed in the upstanding housing
wall.The above described pressure transducer provides highly
satisfactory results when operated in the low to moderate pressure
ranges of up to approximately 500 psi (3450 KPa). However, when
subjected to higher pressures the transducers tend to fail with
one of the principle failure modes being related to a tendency of
the gasket to extrude between the housing and the pressure
sensing module due to distortion of the housing wall and/or the
crimp resulting in seal failure and leakage. This problem has
been effectively overcome by placing a relatively rigid back-up
ring formed of material such as polytetrafluoroethylene in
contact with the housing and the pressure sensing module around
the less rigid O-ring to prevent it from partially extruding
between the housing and the sensing module. Loading over time is
stabilized by burning in all the elements of the transducer prior
to calibration
