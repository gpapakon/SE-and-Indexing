<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of alumina by the Bayer process includes a precipitation process having an agglomeration stage and a growth stage. In the agglomeration stage, selected process parameters are controlled to limit the bound soda content of the slurry, whilst still maintaining conditions for high yield. In the growth stage, selected process parameters are controlled to controll the soda pick-up during growth so that a continuous decrease of soda content is obtained. Preferably, the growth stage is divided into a number of separate precipitation vessels and the temperature drop from one precipitator to the next is from 1 to 3  DEG C. The temperature of the liquor leaving the final precipitator is preferably about 55  DEG C. The agglomeration stage is preferably operated at 75 - 85  DEG C. Apparatus suitable for use in the method is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in alumina
plants, and particularly plants operating according to
the Bayer process to extract alumina from bauxite.The Bayer process, and numerous improvements and
modifications thereof, is widely used in the processing
of bauxite to produce metal grade alumina. Most alumina
plants producing metal grade alumina currently use a
precipitation process which is a combination of
agglomeration and growth to meet the requirements for
crystal size and morphology. The precipitation process
is normally carried out at the lowest possible
temperature to maximize the process yield.Modern downstream alumina users now require that
the alumina be provided with a low soda content, while
maintaining the desired crystal size and morphology. To
achieve a lower soda content, the precipitator start
temperatures are usually increased, and this results in
considerable loss of yield, and thus plant efficiency.It is the object of the present invention to
provide alumina plant improvements which result in a
high yield of low soda alumina. In the present
specification, the term "low soda" should be understood
to include soda contents of about 0.25 to 0.35 per cent
Na2O. N. Brown, in Proceedings Light Metals, Vol. 119,
February 1990, pages 131 to 139, describes the process for
the precipitation of aluminum trihydroxide in three stages.
The first stage, termed seed deactivation, involves ball
milling about 15% of the product trihydrate stream to
produce seed of a fine dimension (80 to 85% less than 44
µm). The ball milled seed particles are then feed to a
first stage precipitation that has an initial temperature of
62°C and a final temperature of 58°C. The second stage,
termed the agglomeration step, involves agglomeration
precipitation of the fine, deactivated seeds of stage 1 at
a starting temperature of 76°C and an end temperature of
68°C. The agglomerated solids are separated, and the liquor
recovered from this stage is feed back to the seed
deactivation stage. Finally, the third stage is a growth
stage carried out in fresh pregnant liquor. The growth
stage has a starting temperature of 76°C and an outlet
temperature of 56°C. The temperature profile used in the
growth stage involves a step change of 6°C after 8 hours
precipitation. The process is said to result in high liquor
productivity, strengthened particle structure, and low
sodium content in the precipitated particles.AU-B-50249/85 describes a process and apparatus for
precipitation of aluminium trihydroxide for use in the
production
