<ABSTRACT>
A sealed lead acid battery having a thermostat 
or thermal protector as a protector of battery from heat 

is provided, which comprises a battery container comprised 
of cell chambers each containing a cell element. 

A terminal box is provided at the end of the battery 
container. The battery container is provided at the end 

thereof with the terminal box. The thermostat or thermal 
protector is mounted in the terminal box to be highly 

sensitive to heat, thus protecting the lead acid battery 
from heat. In the terminal box are inserted a pair of 

charge and discharge terminals and the thermostat or 
thermal protector, so that safe positioning of the 

thermostat or thermal protector and good heat conduction 
from the cell element to the thermostat or thermal 

protector are secured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lead acid
battery, particularly to a sealed lead acid battery with
an electric circuit having at a part thereof a protector
for protecting the battery from short circuit or unusual
generation of heat, which is generally called a thermal
protector or thermostat, and more particularly to an
improvement of the structure of the protector by which
the protector is mounted onto a terminal box for
containing the protector as specified in the precharacterising
portion of claim 1.In lead acid batteries with a plurality of
cell chambers containing a group of electrode plates or
cell element, the cell chambers are arranged either in
one direction or in a U-shaped manner. However, in many
cases where batteries have an elongated appearance, the
cell chambers are primarily arranged in a row in one
direction and connected in series to each other.Sealed lead acid batteries of a small size
with cell chambers arranged in a row have been
increasingly required to be light and so handy that they
can be mounted in a one touch onto appliance. In 
response to this requirement, a manner is taken in which
a pair of input and output terminals of a battery are
contained in a terminal box provided on one end of an
elongated container of battery.This manner is such that one of the positive
and negative terminals in the terminal box is connected
to one of the positive and negative terminals provided
on the cell element in the cell most distant from the
terminal box, through a lead provided across the opening
of the container. The terminal box has a pair of windows
exposing a pair of charging and discharging terminals. A
pair of input and output terminals are provided on a
frame-shaped electrically insulating terminal holder at
the right and left ends thereof. The terminal holder is
provided at the back side thereof with a recess. A
thermostat as a protector is mounted in the recess. The
thus formed terminal holder is inserted into the
terminal box and the electric connection is made in the
manner as mentioned above, thereby obtaining the
battery. The thermostat is provided with such a structure
that it is brought into contact with a partition
wall separating the cell chamber and the terminal box to
raise the heat sensitivity thereof.Such conventional structure, which is for example described in JP-A-58201269, gives a good
operation in mounting the pair of input and output
terminals and the thermostat onto the terminal holder
and then inserting the holder into the terminal box.
