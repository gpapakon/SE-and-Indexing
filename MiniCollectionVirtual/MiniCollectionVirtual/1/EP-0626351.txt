<ABSTRACT>
In a method for making optical fiber preforms, the time taken for 
sintering and annealing the clad or jacket layer is significantly reduced by only 

partially sintering the jacket soot boule in an atmosphere of helium. For example, 
instead of using one hundred forty-three minutes to sinter completely the soot boule, 

the boule is only partially sintered by heating in a helium atmosphere for fifty-nine 
minutes. At this stage of course, the soot boule is still partially porous and is 

generally opaque. The completion of the sintering and the annealing is then done in 
a single step in an atmosphere of nitrogen. Surprisingly, we have found that this 

process does not entrap nitrogen in the soot jacket layer to any noticeable or harmful 
extent, and the total time for sintering and annealing is significantly reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for making optical fiber and, more
particularly, to methods for sintering and annealing deposited jacket soot on a glass
rod as part of the process for making optical fiber.One of the steps in making glass optical fiber by the vapor axial
deposition (VAD) method is the step of sintering or consolidating glass particles or
"jacket soot" on a glass core rod. The glass jacket soot is deposited on a glass core
rod by flame hydrolysis to form a porous body known as a soot boule. The soot
boule is then sintered typically in an atmosphere of helium to form a solid glass clad
layer over the glass core rod. After sintering, the clad layer typically contains
imperfections due to trapped helium which are removed by annealing the structure in
an inert atmosphere of a gas having a greater molecular weight than helium,
typically nitrogen. As is pointed out, for example, in the patent of Ito et al.,
No. 4,978,378, granted December 18, 1990, annealing in an inert heavier gas is
necessary for driving helium out of the glass clad layer, and nitrogen is the least
expensive inert gas available for that purpose. (In this context, nitrogen is
customarily treated as an inert gas.)In our experience, it takes typically about one hundred forty-three
minutes to sinter completely the glass soot boule in the helium atmosphere.
Complete sintering results in a jacket layer of clear glass that has shrunk in volume
about fifteen to twenty-five percent from the original glass boule volume. Annealing
is then done typically for one hundred twenty minutes in a nitrogen atmosphere at a
temperature that is typically kept below the glass transition temperature, which is
about 1400 degrees Centigrade.Optical fiber is very widely used, and as a consequence significant
efforts have been made to reduce production costs. Any measure that would reduce
significantly the time taken for sintering and annealing would therefore be regarded
as a significant advance in the art. JP-A-59174538 discloses a method of making a glass body by the VAD
process. A base material is pre-sintered in an inert gas at a temperature at which the
base material does not become transparent, and the pre-sintered body is then further
sintered into transparent form.According to the present invention there is provided a method as defined
in claim 1. In a method for making optical fiber preforms as generally described
above, the time taken for sintering and annealing is significantly reduced by only
partially sintering the jacket soot boule in an

<CLAIMS>
A method for making optical fiber comprising the steps of: depositing
jacket soot on a glass rod by the flame hydrolysis method to form a soot boule;

sintering and annealing the jacket soot, thereby to form an optical fiber preform; and
drawing glass optical fiber from the glass preform; characterized by:


partially sintering the jacket soot by heating it in an atmosphere of a first
gas having a relatively low molecular weight, and which is non-reactive with respect

to the heated preform, a significant portion of said jacket soot being unsintered at the
termination of said partial sintering step;
and thereafter completing the sintering of said jacket soot and annealing
the sintered jacket soot by heating the jacket soot in an atmosphere of a second gas

having a higher molecular weight than the first gas and which is non-reactive with
respect to the heated preform.
The method of claim 1 wherein:


the first gas is helium and the second gas is nitrogen.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein:

during the partial sintering step, axially moving the soot boule through a
hot zone having a temperature of 1500-1600 degrees Centigrade;
and during the step of completing the sintering and the annealing step,
axially moving the soot boule through a hot zone having a temperature of 1500-1600

degrees Centigrade.
The method of claim 1, 1 or 3, wherein:

the duration of the partial sintering step is less than half the duration that
would be required for complete sintering under the same conditions, but is sufficient

to substantially prevent entrapment of the second gas in the sintered glass.
The method of claim 4 wherein:

the duration of the partial sintering is approximately 59/143 of the
duration that, under the same conditions, would be required for complete sintering.
The method of claim 1 wherein: 

the first gas and the second gas are both inert gases.
The method of claim 1 wherein:

the first gas and the second gas are both selected from the group
consisting of inert gases and nitrogen and oxygen, and mixtures thereof.
The method of claim 3 wherein:

the hot zone is approximately five hundred to one thousand millimeters
in axial length;
and during the step of axially moving the boule, the boule is rotated
about its longitudinal axis.
