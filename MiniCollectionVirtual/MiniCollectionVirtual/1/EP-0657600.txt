<ABSTRACT>
An ergonomic handrail/bumper has an elongated metal 
retainer (110,210,310,410,510) of substantially uniform 

cross-section along its length that is adapted to be mounted 
on a wall (W) by supports (S). A bumper-retaining portion 

(112,212,312,412,512) of the retainer includes a 
generally vertically oriented web (114,214,314,414,514), 

to which a handgrip-retaining portion (116,216,316,416, 
516) spaced apart above the web is joined by a connecting 

portion (118,218,318,418,518). A bumper member (120, 
220,320,420,520) is mounted on the front of the web of 

the bumper-retaining portion, 
and a handgrip member (122,222,322,422,522) 

is mounted on the handgrip-retaining 
portion of the retainer. The handgrip-retaining 

a base (e.g., 124) joined to the connecting portion, the base 
being inclined upwardly and rearwardly with respect to the 

front part of the bumper-retaining portion, and a pair of 
spaced apart retaining flanges (e.g., 126/128) extending 

generally upwardly from the base and defining a channel 
(e.g., 130).

<DESCRIPTION>
One aspect of providing assistance to frail or
physically handicapped individuals in various institutions,
such as hospitals and nursing homes, is equipping the
corridors and other spaces frequented by those individuals
with handrails. The handrails are often integrated with
bumper rails, inasmuch as the types of spaces in which
handrails are installed commonly have a variety of food
service and equipment carts, wheelchairs, litters and the
like moving about the space. Bumper rails protect the walls
from being marred or damaged due to impacts by moving
equipment.The assignee of the present invention and several
other manufacturers of wall protection products have
recently introduced ergonomic handrail/bumpers that consist
of extruded aluminum retainers and cover members extruded
from impact-resistant polymeric materials, such PVC, that
are mounted on the retainers and provide attractive, durable
surfaces. The handgrip portions are of circular cross-section,
with a diameter of about 3.8 cm (1.5 inch), which has been
generally accepted to be the optimum size for enabling most
frail or disabled people to get a good grip on the rail. 
Various building standards and codes have also established
strength requirements for handrails, which presently
available handrail/bumpers based on metal retainers and PVC-based
covers usually meet. Examples of such
handrail/bumpers are described and shown in U.S. Pat. No.
5,165,643 (Shreiner, Nov. 24, 1992) and U. S. Pat. Appln.
Ser. No. 07/855,905 (Shreiner, March 23, 1992).Wood has long been a favored material for use in
such building products as trim, paneling, railings, and
moldings. Wood has come to represent, perhaps inherently or
perhaps by custom, high quality and richness. Plastics and
metals, on the other hand, with the possible exception of
such costly metals as brass and bronze, are perceived by
some people as being less rich and handsome in appearance
than wood. Even plastics that are given a leatherette or
wood grain appearance simply do not have the richness and
aesthetic appeal of natural wood.In addition to its good appearance, natural wood
has the advantages of being a renewable resource and of
being capable of being disposed of without damage to the
environment. Plastics and metals, on the other hand, are
not renewable resources, are costly to recycle and are not
as readily disposed of as wood is. Wood is relatively easy
to work and is relatively energy-efficient in terms of
bringing it from the forest to the place of use. As a material for wall railings

An ergonomic handrail/bumper includes an elongated
metal retainer of substantially uniform cross-section

along its length and adapted to be mounted on a wall in
spaced-apart relation therefrom on supports and having

in cross-section a bumper-retaining portion that
includes a generally vertically oriented web, a

handgrip-retaining portion spaced apart above the web,
and a connecting portion joining the web to the

handgrip-retaining portion, a bumper member mounted on
a front part of the bumper-retaining portion, and a

handgrip member mounted on the handgrip-retaining
portion, characterized in that the handgrip-retaining

portion has a base joined to the connecting portion,
the base being inclined upwardly and rearwardly with

respect to the front part of the bumper-retaining
portion, and a pair of spaced apart retaining flanges

extending generally upwardly from the base and defining
a channel, and in that the handgrip member is of a

solid material and has surfaces engaging the base of
the handgrip-retaining portion and a pair of grooves

receiving the retaining flanges and defining a rib
portion that is received in the channel of the

handgrip-retaining portion of the retainer. 
A handrail/bumper according to claim 1 and further
characterized in that the rib portion of the handgrip

member is in a close fit with the retaining flanges of
the handgrip-retaining portion of the retainer.
