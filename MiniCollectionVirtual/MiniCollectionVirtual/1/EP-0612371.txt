<ABSTRACT>
In a rotary screw machine a shaft journal (7) of one of the rotors (6) is mounted in main thrust bearings (9, 10) and a balancing thrust bearing (11), the latter being located outermost on the shaft journal (7). The main thrust bearings (9, 10) are clamped towards the low pressure end of the machine. The balancing thrust bearing (11) is affected by a thrust balancing device for counter-acting the gas forces on the rotor (6), thereby reducing the force that has to be transferred by the main thrust bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotary screw machine for a gaseous working medium with 
at least one screw rotor operating in a casing including a low and a high pressure end section, 
which rotor at operation is exposed to axial gas forces in a direction from the high pressure 
end section towards the low pressure end section, defined as the positive axial direction. The 
rotor has at least one shaft journal mounted in bearings in one of said end sections, which 
bearings include thrust bearing means with main thrust bearing means adjacent the rotor and 
balancing thrust bearing means adjacent the outer end of the shaft journal, which thrust 
bearing means are provided with thrust balancing means located axially between the main and 
balancing thrust bearing means and exerting a positively directed axial force on the main 
thrust bearing means and a negatively directed axial force on the balancing thrust bearing 
means. With thrust bearing in this application is meant bearings which transfer at least axial loads, 
i.e. pure axial bearings as well as bearings transferring both axial and radial loads. A rotary screw machine with such a thrust balancing arrangement is disclosed in 
US-A 4,915,514. In that disclosure the general 
advantages gained by a thrust balancing device are discussed as well as the particular 
advantages attained by the above specified kind of thrust balancing, namely longer running 
life for the thrust bearings and a simplified exchange of bearings. In that known device the main thrust bearing means transfer axial forces in the positive direction 
only whereas the balancing thrust bearing means transfer axial forces in both directions. 
A preloading spring acts on the balancing thrust bearing means, securing a proper axial 
localisation of the rotor so that a certain play between the high pressure end of the rotor and 
the adjacent end wall is assured when the machine is at rest or idles. At operation the 
positively directed axial gas forces on the rotor are partly balanced by a piston of the thrust 
balancing means acting on the outer ring of the balancing thrust bearing means in the negative 
axial direction. The balancing force is mainly received in that gas from the high pressure side 
of the machine is conducted to the piston to act thereon. The balancing force will be larger 
than the force from the preloading spring with the effect that the resulting force on the outer  
 
ring of the balancing thrust bearing means is negatively directed, which force is transmitted to 
the
