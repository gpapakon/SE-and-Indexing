<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONLASER PROCESSING APPARATUSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a workpiece laser processing apparatus, e.g. for cutting or welding.BACKGROUND ARTCertain laser applications, such as cutting or welding, require an assist gas for work area subjected to the laser beam. Oxygen is an effective assist gas for cutting applications, while, for welding, any of a number of inert gases, such as helium, argon or even dry nitrogen may be used.On commonly used laser apparatus, the assist gas, which is normally supplied by the focusing nozzle together with the laser beam, is directed freely on to the work area. However, this arrangement involves a number of drawback as described in detail in the following.For example, laser cutting of metal plate is usually performed with the aid of a jet of gas directed onto the cutting "area for flushing out the liquefied material. The type of gas used depends on the workpiece material, and must be so selected as to prevent undesirable chemical reactions affecting the cutting faces. It is particularly important to prevent the formation of products affecting the metallurgical structure of the cutting faces and so resulting in hardness or fragility, which prevents post-process machining or actual use of the part if no further machining is required.Oxygen is excellent for cutting ferrous materials(alloys), due to the exothermic reaction produced at high temperatures (over 720Â°C ). If properly employed, the energy and fluid-thermodynamic effects so produced may result in increased cutting speed for a given power of the laser,SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

improved flush-out of the liquefied material, and a better surface finish of the cutting faces.To understand the chain of events occurring in this process, some knowledge is required of the fluid- thermodynamics of reactive gases, and the complex phenomena produced when such a gas is subjected to intense heat by both the laser beam and the liquefied material, and the mass of the gas stream is increased by the presence of the liquid. The latter results in a gas stream consisting of a mixture of compressible gas and (incompressible) liquid, with all the possibilities this entails. For example, the liquid may be broken down into large or small drops, or even atomized.Depending on the amount of heat, particularly that radiated by the laser beam and high-temperature solid or fluid surfaces, and the combined thermal and fluid-dynamic effects involved, the drops and atomized liquid particles may be converted into steam, which,
