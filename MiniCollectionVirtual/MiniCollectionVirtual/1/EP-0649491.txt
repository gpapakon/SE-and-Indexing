<ABSTRACT>
A child safety gate (1) for blocking a passage (2), particularly for children and pets. The gate can be suspended at one (4) of its side edges and is lockable at its other side edge (5) by means of a child proof locking device. The gate consists, between its side edges, of a roll-type curtain (3), which can be rolled around one of said side edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a child safety gate for
blocking a passage, particularly for children and pets.
Each side of the gate is defined by a vertical side edge,
one of the side edges being connected to one side of the
passage, the other side edge of the gate being, by means of
a child proof locking device, removably mounted and locked
against the other side of the passage, when it is desired
to restrain the passage, and released therefrom when it is
desired to open the passage.Child safety gates of the above kind are commonly known and
used, particularly in households where small children are
present, and where there is a high demand for child safety.
The gate will ensure not only that the children cannot injure
themselves in stairways or in other places where it is
not possible to permanently watch the children, but will
also ensure that the children can be kept away from places
where they may damage fragile goods. This also applies to
leisure sites, camping grounds and the like. The same demands
are often raised also for domestic animals.In some cases there is an important need for temporary restrainments,
for example when moving certain animals.As far as safety gates for children and pets are concerned,
and also where there is a need to close passages for animals,
for example in stables and folds, there are today only
gates in the form of wooden or metal gates having bars.
These are bulky, hard and unwieldy. The gates may cause injury
to children, if they will collide hard aginst the gate.
The gates are also bulky, and cannot be removed out of
the way when not being used, which brings about that they 
will not be used to that extent that would be desirable,
which of course will result in more accidents. Known gates
and other passage restrainments having bars, cables and
the like, do not even function for dog whelps, for instance,
since they can crawl between the cables or bars.Pull-out roller blind-type screen restrainment structures
are known for use as screen doors and window ventilators
and the like, see for instance GB-A-2 188 358 and
US-A-1 958 695. In these known pull-out roller structures,
when the blind is pulled out and arrested in a required
position, there is no mechanism which locks the blind
against further extension. Such structures could not,
therefore, form effective child safety screens or barriers,
since they can extend on impact. For example, should
a child impact with the known screen, the screen will extend
such that the child could crawl under the screen.The object of

<CLAIMS>
Child safety gate (1) for blocking a passage (2), particularly
for children and pets, each side of the gate being

defined by a vertical side edge (4 and 5, respectively),
one (4) of the side edges being connected to one

side (2b) of the passage, the other side edge (5) of the
gate being, by means of a child proof locking device, removably

mounted and locked against the other side (2d) of
the passage, when it is desired to restrain the passage,

and released therefrom when it is desired to open the
passage,
characterized
 in that the gate (1) consists,
between said vertical side edges (4, 5), of a roll-type

screening, for instance a curtain (3), which, in the open
condition of the gate can be uprolled around said one (4)

of the vertical side edges, and which in the closed condition
of the gate can be extended and stretched across

the passage (2), said one (4) of the vertical side edges
consisting of an upright, for instance a so called roll-type

bar, said upright (4) being biassed by a counter-force
means, for instance a spring (17), such that the

curtain (3) can be unrolled against the urging of said
counter-force means, and said upright (4) being provided

with a locking or braking device (8, 10a, 12), such that
the gate can be blocked in a selected, extended position.
A gate according to claim 1, 
characterized

in that the curtain (3) is made of cloth, woven fabric,
plastic, rubber, net or the like of a natural or synthetic

material.
A gate according to any preceding claim, 
characterized

in that the curtain is reinforced be reinforcing
means (35).
A gate according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the curtain (3) consists of a plurality of interconnected,

vertically oriented solid parts, for instance
of lamellas (30).
A gate according to any preceding claim, 
characterized

in that said other side edge (5) consists of
a bar which is loosely or fixed connected to the curtain.
