<ABSTRACT>
A fiber optic connector having improved alignment and manufacturing characteristics over traditional connectors. A fiber optic connector of the present invention has a first connector ferrule and alignment means for aligning the first connector ferrule with a matching second connector ferrule. The fiber optic connector includes a first connector ferrule including a first mating surface. The mating surface defines at least one receiving cavity, and at least one protruding alignment rod is seated in the cavity and extends from the mating surface. The alignment rod has a diameter D1 and protruded from the mating surface a protrusion distance p1, wherein p1 
<
/= 2D1. In an exemplary embodiment the rod has a spherical tip and 0.5D1 
<
/= p1

<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL CONNECTOR USING LARGE DIAMETER ALIGNMENT PINSRELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is a continuation-in-part of United States Application Serial No. 08/953,950, entitled "Alignment Assembly for Multifiber or Single Fiber Optical Cable Connector", which is a continuation of United States Application Serial No. 08/614,412, issued as United States Patent No. 5,778,123. The present application also is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application Serial No. 08/819,247, entitled "Stubless Optoelectronic Device Receptacle", filed September 22, 1998. All of the related applications are commonly assigned to the Assignee of the present invention and the disclosures of the above which are herein incorporated by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to connectors for optical fibers and devices. In particular, the present invention relates to an optical connector including a rounded rod alignment feature.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Optical fibers are increasingly being used for the transmission of optical signals. Optical fibers offer greatly increased transmission capability and transmission characteristics over traditional copper wires.The use of optical fibers, however, does present some difficulties. Optical fibers are, in fact, conductors of light signals. To avoid losing or degrading the light signals being transmitted, there is a need for precise alignment and coupling any time optical fibers are connected to each other or to optical devices. Optic transfer 

efficiency is the term used to measure the ability of a connector to accurately couple the transmitted light signals .Use of optical cables has generally been limited to large scale long haul trunking installations, such as those of the telecommunications industry, where the improved transmission characteristics of the optical fibers justify the greater expense and typical difficulty associated with their manufacturing and installation. Nevertheless, as demands on communication media and data volume continue to increase, the advantages of using optical cable for transmission of signals across shorter distances, or for interconnecting local devices, continues to grow. With this growth has come a need to connect fiber optic cables accurately and economically to each other and to a multiplicity of devices.Of considerable relevance to the problem of developing practical fiber optic connectors is the question of the optic transfer efficiency at the connector. Various factors affect the optic
