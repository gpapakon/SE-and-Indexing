<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a safety hose (1), in particular high-pressure hose, which is enclosed by a flexible protective sheath (4) which is fixed on an abutment by an end-side pulling means (6). The invention proposes that the protective sheath be an elastic, hollow-cylindrical sleeve (4), preferably consisting of rubber or plastic, and be fastened on the hose (1) over its entire surface, and that a cable (5) runs within the sleeve (4), usually between the sleeve (4) and the hose (1), in the axial direction, and be fastened on the end side on the pulling means (6).

Safety hose, especially a high pressure hose, which is surrounded by a 
flexible, hollow cylindrical sleeve, which is affixed to the hose all-over and is 

fixable to a counter support by means of an endwise tension medium, wherein 

said sleeve (4) consists of an elastic material, preferably rubber or plastic, 
a cable (5) extends within said sleeve (4) in an axial direction, 
and said cable (5) is fixable endwise to tension medium (6). 
Safety hose according to claim 1, wherein said cable extends between 
sleeve (4) and hose (1). 
Hose according claim 1 or 2, wherein said sleeve (4) is affixed to hose (1) 
by a vulcanisation or glued joint. 
Hose according to one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the end of cable (5) has the 
form of a loop or an eye. 
Hose according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein said cable (5) is endless.  
 
Hose according to one of claims 1 to 5, wherein said tension medium (6) is 
a steel cable. 
Hose according to one of claims 1 to 6, wherein said tension medium (6) is 
connected to said cable (5) and/or the counter support via spring hooks (8). 
Hose according to one of claims 1 to 7, wherein said cable (5) is made of 
high strength, flexible plastic-textile material, preferably of kevlar-reinforced 

fabric. 
Hose according to one of claims 1 to 8, wherein there are at least two 
cables (5) disposed preferably equidistantly across the circumference of said 

hose (1).
