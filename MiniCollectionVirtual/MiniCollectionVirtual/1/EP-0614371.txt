<DESCRIPTION>
 PASTEURELLA MULTOCIDA TOXOID VACCINESField of the InventionThis invention is generally in the field of veterinary vaccines, vaccine compositions, and methods of producing same. More particularly, this invention relates to vaccine compositions and methods for protecting animals against diseases associated with infection by toxigenic strains of Pasteurella multocida.Background of the InventionPasteurella multocida has been associated with disease in many species of animals, including man, bovine, ovine and porcine animals. It typically affects the nasopharyngeal regions and lungs of infected animals. For example, in a mixed infection with Bordetella bronchiseptica toxigenic strains of P. multocida. capsular type A or D, cause atrophic rhinitis in swine. Atrophic rhinitis (AR) results in atrophy of the nasal turbinates and deformities of the snouts and faces of pigs.The pathogenicity of P. multocida is due in large part to the production of a potent necrotizing toxin, also called dermonecrotizing toxin (DNT) , which will be referred to hereinafter as "the toxin". The toxin has been characterized as a heat-labile protein 

 with a molecular weight of approximately 140,000 to 160,000.P. multocida is distinguishable from other species of pasteurella on the basis of its growth characteristics, as follows: hemolysis: negative (90%) ; growth on MacConkey's agar: negative; indole production: positive; urease production: negative; and mannitol metabolism: positive. See, Zinsser, Microbiology. edit, by Joklik et al. , Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1980, pages 791-793, which is incorporated herein by reference.Currently available vaccines for protecting animals from diseases associated with infection by P___ multocida include inactivated toxigenic P. multocida cells, inactivated preparations of partly purified P. multocida toxin and combinations of P. multocida cell- free preparations with other inactivated P. multocida strains or B. bronchiseptica strains. [See, e.g., M. Kobisch et al, Vet. Record. 124:57-61 (1989); and N. T. Foged et al, Vet. Record. 125:7-11 (1989)]. These vaccine preparations, however, are not fully protective against disease because they fail to elicit effective amounts of the antibody that neutralizes the toxin, known as "antitoxin". There remains a need in the art of veterinary practice for effective vaccines against infection of animals by toxigenic P. multocida. 

 Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides novel vaccine compositions and components which protect animals

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A vaccine composition comprising a Pasteurella multocida, type D, strain 4677, bacterin with a cell-bound toxoid, which upon internal administration to an animal induces neutralizing antibody to the toxin, and a carrier suitable for internal administration.
2. The vaccine composition of claim 1 produced by treating the P. multocida organisms in the exponential phase of growth with formaldehyde for a time sufficient to inactivate the intracellular toxin.
3. The vaccine composition according to claim 3 further comprising an immunogenic amount of one or more additional antigens.
4. The vaccine composition according to claim 3 wherein said additional antigen comprises a Bordetella bronchiseptica bacterin.
5. The vaccine composition according to claim 1 wherein said additional antigen comprises an Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bacterin. 


 6. The vaccine composition according to claim 3 wherein said additional antigen comprises a soluble free-toxoid of Pasteurella multocida.
7. A vaccine dosage unit comprising 0.5 to 3 mL of a sterile suspension of an immunogenic amount of a P. multocida, type D, strain 4677 bacterin with cell- bound toxoid.
8. A Pasteurella multocida, type D, strain 4677, bacterin with a cell-bound toxoid, which upon internal administration to an animal induces the production of neutralizing antitoxin.
9. A method for vaccinating an animal against P. multocida which comprises internally administering to the animal an immunogenic amount of a P. multocida, type D, strain 4677, bacterin with cell-bound toxoid.
10. A method for vaccinating an animal against P. multocida which comprises internally administering to the animal a vaccine composition of claims 1 through 6.
11. A vaccine composition comprising (1) a Pasteurella multocida bacterin with cell-bound toxoid which upon internal administration to an animal induces the production of antitoxin and (2) a P. multocida 


 soluble free toxoid, and a carrier suitable for internal administration.
12. The vaccine composition according to claim 11 which comprises at least 150 relative toxoid units per mL of said free toxoid.
13. The vaccine composition according to claim 11 further comprising an immunogenic amount of one or more additional antigens.
14. The vaccine composition according to claim 13 wherein said additional antigen comprises a Bordetella bronchiseptica bacterin.
15. The vaccine composition according to claim 13 wherein said additional antigen comprises an Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bacterin.
16. A vaccine dosage unit comprising 0.5 to 3 mL of a sterile solution of an immunogenic amount of a P. multocida free toxoid and a P. multocida bacterin with cell-bound toxoid.
