<ABSTRACT>
Systems (21, 501, 801) for abrasive action include machinery for
creating a vacuum and positive pressure to enable flow control while

providing adequate vacuum to both retrieve and capture the spent
abrasive material and the abraded material. A first embodiment (21)

includes a vacuum and boost operation facilitated by the use of a foot
control (51) for high control of abrasion, cleaning and polishing. A

second embodiment (801) is for use with human tissue and includes a
vacuum only system with filtered air. A third embodiment (501) includes

vacuum with automatic boost for skilled medical personnel use and uses
a minimum vacuum level to trigger a pre-set boost operation. The system

utilizes air filtration, ultra violet, heat oven sterilization and secure waste
storage. A manual contact tool (75) is used closely with the area to be

abraded supplanting any other control other than the pressing of the
manual contact tool (75) against the surface to be abraded, to create

sufficient vacuum to trigger boost operation. A hand-held direct particle
beam abrasion manual contact tool (75) having a prophylactic tip which

creates a concentric space within which the kinetics of focussed direct
impact and radial collection of spent abrasive particles and abraded

material is collectably withdrawn. A flow accelerator within an annular
insert of the manual contact tool (75) and prophylactic tip (101) can be

varied to suit many applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of controlled directed abrasion by impact of abrasive particles, and a valve for use in a system for providing advantageous control of the geometry of impact and collection, as well as the process flow conditions, safety and sanitation of the spent abrasive particles and abraded material.The use of particles to abrade contacted surface areas is well known. Particles can moved by kinetic energy to remove material from other surfaces, as by buffing, polishing, tumbling and by directed flow of particles in a carrier media. The best known large scale example of directed flow of particles in a carrier media is sand blasting. Sand blasting is done using industrial scale equipment, consuming bags of generally screened, but non-uniform size particles. A high air pressure is used to spray the sand on the surface to be impacted, thereby causing abrasion of the surface and with higher pressure cause actual cutting of the materialFor smaller sized applications, the sand size is more tightly uniform. For indoor use, and for reasons of cleanliness and sanitation, the collection of spent sand must also be accommodated. In U.S. Patent 5,037,432, a hand held device which facilitates the collection of spent sand is illustrated. In this device it is stated as an essential element, that the flow of sand impinge upon the surface to be abraded at an inclined angle. In fact, the device of this patent is designed primarily toward the circularity of the return path of the spent sand, and provides an opening for abrasion as part of the circular path of travel of the abrading material. Abrasion is caused by having the abrading material pass laterally by the surface of material to be abraded and by a sloughing action removes material. The material is removed in a non-linear fashion with most material removed at the upstream end of exposure of the surface to be abraded in the path of circular flow of the abrading material. The abrasion of the material surface downstream of the initial contact is caused by tumbling of the media and further mixed sloughing. Because of the shallow angle of attack, at least half or more of the kinetic energy in the particles is used to move them along in a tumbling fashion end over end, meaning that less than half of the kinetic energy of the particles can be applied to abrade the target surface. These design characteristics makes the tool inefficient and limits its use for various applications. Further, such inefficient use translates into the wasting use of
