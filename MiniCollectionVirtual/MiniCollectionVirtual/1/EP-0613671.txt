<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides improvements in 
absorbent products, but is particularly useful with urinary 

incontinence pads (100). An embossed pattern (120) on the bottom layer 
(106) of the double layer absorbent core construction improves the 

removal of urine or other fluids from the discharge zone to 
be ready for next void. One or more V-shaped notches (306) cut at 

both ends of the pad provides the ergonomic fit of the pad to 
reduce the inevitable stiffness. The sides are designed as a 

flap which curves during the sealing process and provide 
natural curved flaps which form a soft gasket cushion (103) and 

yields extra leak protection in the crotch area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to articles for 
absorbing body fluids. More particularly the present 
invention relates to pads for absorbing menstrual fluids 
and/or urine. There are numerous shapes, styles and constructions 
of absorbent articles designed to absorb and retain menstrual 
fluid or urine, the latter being used to alleviate urinary 
incontinence. These pads are generally placed against the 
perineal area of a subject and are held in place by the 
crotch portion of an undergarment. However, certain products 
have an integral panty, while others use straps or belts as 
affixing devices. Finally, certain absorbent products cover 
a larger area, e.g., infant and adult incontinent diapers. 
Thus, for purposes of the present invention, terms such as 
absorbent article or pad are meant to encompass all of these 
types of devices. The use of a composite structure comprised of 
cellulosic fibers and superabsorbent powder as an absorbent 
for diapers, catamenial pads, incontinence pads, and other 
absorbent articles is well known. One problem associated 
with the application of this composite is its limited liquid 
transport capacity, caused by the so called "gel block" 
phenomena. When liquid is initially absorbed the 
superabsorbent swells and forms a gel, however, this gel 
inhibits further liquid absorption within the absorbent  
 
structure. This problem is particularly severe after long 
wearing with a thin layer construction that has a very small 
cross section or critical mass for wicking to take place 
after liquid is introduced. Prior attempts have been made to reduce or 
eliminate the gel-block phenomenon, For example, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,798,603 claims an absorbent article with a liquid-permeable 
transport layer placed between the cover and the 
absorbent core. The transport layer is made of a material 
which is less hydrophilic than the absorbent core and which 
has an effective average pore size that is smaller than the 
cover layer pore size. U.S. Patent No. 4,892,532 discloses 
an absorbent article with a thin spun-bonded hydrophobic 
cover and a hydrophobic melt-bonded fabric layer between the 
cover and the absorbent core. The hydrophobic melt-bonded 
layer has a higher basis weight than the cover fabric. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,908,026 discloses an absorbent article with a 
cover that has perforations arranged in the center of the 
product. A "flow zone control" layer is placed between the 
cover and the absorbent core in the area under the cover's 
perforations. U.S. Patent No.

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article comprising an absorbent 
core having a body-facing side and a garment-facing side, the 

absorbent core comprised of: 
   a bottom layer comprising an absorbent 

material embossed to form a pattern of areas of 
differing density; and 

   an upper layer comprised of an absorbent 
material. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein the 
bottom layer further comprises a superabsorbent material. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein the 
absorbent material comprises cellulosic fibers. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein the 
pattern of areas comprises a series of parallel lines of 

alternating densities. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein the 
pattern of areas comprises a series of intersecting lines of 

alternating densities. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein the 
pattern of areas comprises at least two sets of parallel 

lines that intersect to form a grid pattern of alternating 
densities. 
The absorbent article of claim 1 further 
comprising an overwrap disposed on at least the body facing 

and garment facing sides of the absorbent article. 
The absorbent article of claim 7, wherein the 
absorbent core has longitudinal edges and the overwrap covers 

the longitudinal edges. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, further 
comprising a facing disposed across the body facing side. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein the 
facing comprises a non-woven material.
