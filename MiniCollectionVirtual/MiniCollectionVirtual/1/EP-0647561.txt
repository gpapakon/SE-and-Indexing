<ABSTRACT>
It comprises a transfer belt or chain (1) stretched between two drive wheels (11, 12) with vertical axes (shafts) (111, 121) and equipped with uniformly spaced drive means (13) which are each intended for holding (supporting) a carriage (2) including a movable holding and separating means (22) intended to form a group (31) of products (3), one of the strands (10) of the said chain (1) including two uncouplings (14, 15), the first (14) of which, located a short distance after the wheel (12) for supplying the carriages (2), makes it possible to detach them from the chain (1), whilst a roller (242) secured to the said carriage (2) engages in the groove (51) of a variable-pitch screw (5), the axis of which is parallel to the straight line connecting the two points (14, 15) of uncoupling and the length of which is approximately equal to the distance separating the said two points (14, 15) of uncoupling.

Apparatus for the formation, for packaging thereof, of groups 
of products supplied by a conveyor and disposed in contiguous rows, 

characterised in that it comprises a transfer chain or belt (1) tensioned 
between two drive wheels (11, 12) with their axes (111, 121) vertical and 

provided with regularly spaced entrainment means (13) each intended to 
hold a carriage (2) comprising a movable holding and separation means 

(22) intended to form a group (30) of products (3), one of the runs (10) 
of said chain (1) comprising two offset portions (14, 15) of which the 

first (14), disposed at a short distance after the supply wheel (12) for 
the carriages (2), permits them to be disengaged from the chain (1) while 

a roller (242) which is fixed with respect to said carriage (2) engages 
into the groove (51) of a screw (5) which is of a variable pitch and 

whose axis is parallel to the straight line connecting the two offset 
points (14, 15) and the length of which is approximately equal to the 

distance separating said two offset points (14, 15). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the chain 
(1) comprises pairs of lugs (13), into each of which is inserted a 

latching finger (241) fixed to the end of a connecting leg (24) fixed 
with respect to the body (21) of a carriage (2) which is secured in its 

lower part to a movable cap (22). 
Apparatus according to either one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the two offset portions (14, 15) of the chain (1) 

are each created by two wheels (141, 142; 151, 152) disposed in the same 

horizontal plane as the wheels (11) and (12), and that the variable-pitch 
screw (5) is disposed below the end wheels (141, 151) of said offset 

portions (14, 15), in parallel relationship with the plane of said chain, 
its length being approximately equal to the distance separating said end 

wheels (141, 151).  
 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the pitch of the screw (5) first decreases after 

the first offset portion (14) and then increases to the second offset 
portion (15). 
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a second chain (6) which is disposed parallel to 

the chain (1) comprises pairs of dogs (62) which are spaced by the width 
of a group (30) and which come to embrace said groups (30) prior to the 

upward movement of the movable cap (22) of the carriage (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the caps 
(22) comprise gripping means which act upon upward movement thereof and 

which permit a plurality of units of products to be seized. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 or claim 6 characterised in that 
the caps (22) comprise a plurality of compartments (7, 8, 9) of 

parallelepipedic shape which are movable with a translatory movement with 
respect to each other under the effect of a set of rods (100) 

interconnecting the different compartments (7, 8, 9) and itself connected 
to a mechanical device (107, 16, 17) controlling the relative 

displacement of one or more of said compartments with respect to the 
others.
