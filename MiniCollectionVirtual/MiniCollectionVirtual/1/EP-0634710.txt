<ABSTRACT>
A hologram is fabricated by opening a volume 
phase reflection hologram formed in a recording medium (15) 

such as a positive photoresist. The opening occurs by 
forming a second hologram, such as an off-axis hologram, 

in the same recording medium. The opened hologram can 
be replicated in metal and the metal can be used to 

emboss the fringe pattern of the opened hologram into 
plastic. A full range of colors in the visible spectrum 

may be obtained by metallizing the embossed plastic 
structure and then by overcoating it with appropriate 

clear dielectric layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to diffraction
gratings and holograms.A hologram is a recording of an interference
fringe pattern between two beams of light. One of these
beams usually comprises light reflected from a real
object and is called an "object beam," while the other
beam is usually a pure and unmodulated beam and is
called a "reference beam." If the object beam is pure
and unmodulated like the reference beam, then a set of
regular interference fringes is recorded and the
hologram is referred to as a holographic diffraction
grating. when a hologram is illuminated with only the
reference beam, the object beam is exactly reproduced in
phase and amplitude.There are two types of holographic recording
configurations that are in prevalent use today. The
first is called an off-axis, or "Leith-Upatniaks,"
hologram. In forming this type of hologram, the object
beam and the reference beam impinge upon a recording
medium from the same side and from directions which are
separated by a small angle. As shown in FIG. 1, the
planes of the resulting interference fringes, which
planes bisect the angle, are formed substantially
perpendicular to the surface of the recording medium. 
Holographic diffraction gratings and embossed display
holograms in use today are predominantly formed from
this type of hologram.This hologram is considered to be an
improvement over the original hologram invented by
Gabor, before the advent of the laser and its coherent
light made off-axis configuration possible. With the
Gabor, or in-line hologram, the object and reference
beams fall in a line on the same axis. Because of the
considerable difficulties involved in separating these
beams, this hologram never came into wide use. As shall
be seen later, however, one embodiment of the present
invention exploits this configuration to useful
advantage.Embossed display holograms are typically
formed from off-axis holograms in a multi-step process.
The first step usually involves making a primary
off-axis hologram where the real object is positioned
some distance from the surface of the recording medium
and the reference beam is a collimated or parallel beam.
The second step usually involves illuminating the
primary off-axis hologram with a collimated beam of
light to project a real image of the object into space.
A second hologram is then made by positioning a new
recording medium at the position of the projected real
image and by introducing a new reference beam at an
angle. After development, the second hologram can be
viewed under
