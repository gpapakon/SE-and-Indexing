<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic 
composite material which has a high mechanical strength 
and an excellent creep resistance in a wide temperature 
range from room temperature to high temperature and is 
suitable to be used as a structural material at a high 
temperature. SiC or Si3N4 has been investigated to develop 
ceramic materials to be used at high temperatures but is 
not sufficient in high temperature properties. As an 
alternative material thereof, SiC/SiC composite materials 
produced by chemical vapor impregnation, provided by 
Societe Europeene de Propulsion, have attracted 
attention, at the present are considered to be the best 
high temperature structural materials and have been 
investigated and developed. The temperature range at 
which they can be used is reported to be 1400°C or lower. Mr. T. Parthasarathy et al. in Journal of the 
American Ceramics Society Vol. 76, No. 1, pp29 - 32 
(1993) disclosed a composite of alumina and yttrium 
aluminum garnet (sometime hereinafter referred to as 
"YAG") of eutectic Al2O3-Y3Al5O12. Mr. Parthasarathy et 
al. also disclose a method of producing the composite by 
unidirectionally melting and solidifying a mixed powder 
of Al2O3 and Y2O3 in a crucible. It is comprehensible from the description on 
page 29, right column, lines 9 to 10 and Figs. 1 and 2 of 
the literature that the composite is polycrystalline and 
includes grain boundaries. This is clearly supported 
from the description "The failure was usually along the 
colony boundaries with crack running along the Al2O3-YAG 
interface boundaries". These colony boundaries are shown  
 
as portions where the microstructure is larger than in 
the other portions in Fig. 2 of the literature. This composite material has stresses equivalent 
to those of sapphire at 1530°C and 1650°C when the strain 
rate was make constant. Moreover, the present inventors confirmed in 
experiments that the composite disclosed by 
Mr. Parthasarathy et al. includes pores or voids in the 
microstructure and the mechanical strength of the 
composite rapidly lowers at high temperature. Therefore, the object of the present invention 
is to provide a ceramic composite material comprising 
sapphire, single crystalline α-Al2O3, and YAG, which has 
an excellent mechanical strength and creep behavior from 
room temperature to high temperature and significantly 
improved these properties particularly at high 
temperature. The above object is attained in accordance with the 
present invention by providing a composite
