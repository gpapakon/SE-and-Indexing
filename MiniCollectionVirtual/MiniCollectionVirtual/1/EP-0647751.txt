<ABSTRACT>
An airbeam (12) is formed of a bladder (20) covered 
by a sleeve (42) having a 

preselected shape, which may be for example curvilinear. When 
the bladder is inflated it takes the shape of the sleeve to form 

a structural member for a shelter or other temporary structure. 
Preferably the sleeve is a braided fabric. The airbeam is made 

by first forming a solid mandrel of the bladder and then braiding 
the sleeve about the mandrel. The fabric is formed of several 

interlocked layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to beams used in making various 
structures such hangars, temporary shelters and the like, and 
more particularly to air-inflated beams and a method of making 
such airbeams. Sometimes it is necessary to erect relatively temporary 
structures in a short period of time. These structures may be 
necessary for providing shelter to homeless people, military 
personnel, for storing equipment during extreme weather 
conditions, or for storing hazardous waste prior to disposal. 
Such structures may also be used as hangars for aircraft or to 
provide a protective dome for tennis courts or sport stadiums. Typically such temporary structures are supported in three 
different ways. One common method is to provide a substantially 
semi-circular air impermeable membrane which is inflated and 
supported by the internal air-pressure. This method can be 
unsatisfactory because it makes use of noisy air pumps which must 
be operated continuously. Moreover entrance and egress through 
these structures can be effected only through air locks which are 
slow and cumbersome to operate. In addition, economically it is  
 
unfeasible to provide these structures with air locks large 
enough to accommodate large equipment, such as for example a 
truck or a helicopter and thus are unsuitable as hangars. Another method of structural support frequently used consists 
of frame work formed of metal bars, beams or pipes. A membrane 
is then pulled over and secured to the frame. This method is 
also unsatisfactory because it is expensive, time consuming and 
can requires special skill and/or equipment to erect. Moveover 
because of the weight of the frame components, it is difficult 
and expensive to transport from one location to another. A third method for supporting shelters also provides a frame 
work, however its components consist of tubular pressurized 
fabric members bent into curvilinear shapes. A membrane is 
either integrally attached to, or pulled over and secured to the 
pressurized fabric members. As a result these members require 
substantial forces to bend them into curvilinear shapes. Moreover 
if punctured they are prone to explosive depressurization 
accompanied by catastrophic and rapid collapse of the structure. In view of the above mentioned disadvantages of the prior art, 
it is an objective of the present invention to provide an air 
beam which is lightweight so that it is easy to transport form 
location to location yet strong so that it can easily support a 
membrane.  A further
