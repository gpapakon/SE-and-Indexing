<DESCRIPTION>
 N-SUBSTITUTED CYCLOALKYL AND POLYCYCLOALKYLALPHA-SUBSTITUTED Trp-Phe- ANDPHENETHYLAMINE DERIVATIVESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION5 Agents acting at central cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors induce satiety (Schick, Yaksh and Go, Reσulatorv Peptides 14:277-291, 1986). They are also expected to act as analgesics (Hill, Hughes and Pittaway, Neuropharmacoloσγ 26:289-300, 1987), and as anticonvulsants (MacVicar, Kerrin10 and Davison, Brain Research. 406:130-135, 1987).Reduced levels of CCK-peptides have been found in the brains of schizophrenic patients compared with controls (Roberts, Ferrier, Lee, Crow, Johnstone, Owens, Bacarese- Hamilton, McGregor, O'Shaughnessey, Polak and Bloom..c5 Brain Research 288, 199-211, 1983). It has been proposed tha changes in the activity of CCK neurones projecting to the nucleus accu bens may play a role in schizophrenic processes by influencing dopaminergic function (Totterdell and Smith, Neuroscience 19, 181-192, 1986). This is consistent with20 numerous reports that CCK peptides modulate dopaminergic function in the basal ganglia and particularly the nucleus accumbens (Weiss, Tanzer, and Ettenberg, Pharmacology. Biochemistry and Behaviour 30, 309-317, 1988; Schneider, Allpert and Iversen, Peptides 4, 749-753, 1983). It may25 therefore be expected that agents modifying CCK receptor activity may have therapeutic value in conditions associated with disturbed function of central dopaminergic function suc as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.CCK and gastrin peptides share a common carboxy termina30 pentapeptide sequence and CCK peptides can bind to the gastr receptor of the stomach ucosa and elicit acid secretion in many species including human (Konturek, Gastrointestinal Hormones. Ch. 23, pp 529-564, 1980, ed. G. B. J. Glass, Rave Press, NY). Antagonists of the CCK-B receptor would also be35 expected to be antagonists at the stomach gastrin receptor a 

this would also be of value for conditions involving excessive acid secretion.CCK and gastrin peptides have trophic effects on the pancreas and various tissues of the gastrointestinal tract (Johnson, ibid.. pp 507-527) , actions which are associated with increased DNA and RNA synthesis. Moreover, gastrin secreting cells are associated with certain gastrointestinal tumors as in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (Stadil, ibid., pp 279-739) , and some colorectal tumors may also be gastrin/CCK dependent (Singh, Walker, Townsend and Thompson, Cancer Research. 46, 1612 (1986), and Smith, J.P., Gastroenteroloαv. 95 1541 (1988)).
