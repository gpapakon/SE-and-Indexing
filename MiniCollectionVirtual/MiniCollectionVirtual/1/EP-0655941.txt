<ABSTRACT>
A method for separating gas components by adsorption uses a chamber (1) divided into equal, separate, sealed compartments (27) filled with an adsorbant material (7, 8) chosen according to the gas to be treated, each compartment being designed to temporarily let in the gas to be treated and discharge at least one of the chosen components of this gas, the other component(s) of said gas being adsorbed by said material (7, 8). The gas to be treated is let into one of the compartments (27) until a given pression is reached while further gas to be treated is being let into at least one of the following compartments (27), and the selected component is discharged therefrom. The pressure in a following compartiment (27) is allowed to drop so that partial desorption of the unwanted gaz component(s) and a washing fluid is injected into this compartment to ensure complete desorption. A device for implementing the method is disclosed.
