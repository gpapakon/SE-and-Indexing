<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an unsaturated glycol diester 
is disclosed, which process comprises reacting a conjugated 

diene with a carboxylic acid and molecular oxygen in the 
presence of a solid catalyst comprising (1) palladium and (2) 

tellurium as active components supported on a carrier, wherein 
a said carrier is a solid carrier in which a proportion of the 

volume of pores having a pore radius in the range of from 5 to 
50 nm is 80% or more relative to the total volume of pores 

having a pore radius in the range of from 1.8 to 10,000 nm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an 
unsaturated glycol diester which comprises reacting a 
conjugated diene with a carboxylic acid and molecular oxygen in 
the presence of a solid catalyst comprising (1) palladium and 
(2) tellurium supported on a carrier. Unsaturated glycol diesters, for example, 1,4-butenediol 
diesters, are important intermediate compounds for 
1,4-butanediol which is a raw material for engineering 
plastics, and tetrahydrofuran. Tetrahydrofuran per se is a 
solvent having a high performance, and a polymer thereof, i.e., 
polytetramethylene ether glycol is one of the important raw 
materials for elastic fibers. Hitherto, various processes for producing the 
butenediol diester have been proposed, and, of these 
conventional processes, a process comprising reacting butadiene 
with a carboxylic acid and molecular oxygen in the presence of 
a solid catalyst wherein tellurium and palladium are supported 
on active carbon to produce the butenediol diester is well 
known in the art. More specifically, these conventional processes 
include, for example, a process using a solid catalyst 
containing palladium and at least one of tellurium and  
 
selenium, as disclosed in JP-A-48-72090 (the term "JP-A" as 
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application"), a process using a solid catalyst containing 
palladium, at least one of antimony and bismuth, and at least 
one of tellurium and selenium, as disclosed in JP-A-48-96513, 
a process using, as a carrier for the solid catalyst used in 
the above-described processes, an active carbon which has been 
pretreated with nitric acid for the purpose of improving the 
catalytic activity of the solid catalyst, as disclosed in JP-A-49-11812, 
a process using a specific solid catalyst 
prepared by subjecting the solid catalyst used in the above-described 
processes to a reduction treatment, treating the 
resulting catalyst with a gas containing molecular oxygen at a 
temperature of 200°C or more, and further subjecting the 
catalyst to a reduction treatment, as disclosed in JP-B-52-12686 
(the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined 
published Japanese patent application"), and 
a method for producing an unsaturated glycol diester by 
reacting molecular oxygen, a carboxylic acid and conjugated 
diene in the presence of a solid Pd/Te-catalyst comprising 
as a solid carrier active carbon, as disclosed in EP-A-0 289 
725. Moreover, EP-A-0 336 715 refers to a catalyst for 
diacyloxylation of conjugated dienes by
