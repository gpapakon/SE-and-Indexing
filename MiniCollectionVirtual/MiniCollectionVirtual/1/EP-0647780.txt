<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injection nozzle has a valve member (14) engageable with a 
seating to prevent fuel flow through an outlet orifice. The valve member 

is engaged by the narrower end of a stepped piston member (21) the 
surface (21A) of which remote from the valve member is subjected to 

fuel under pressure to bias the valve member into engagement with the 
seating. A tubular valve element (28) the interior of which is connected 

to a drain, is engageable with the surface but can be moved away from 
the surface to lower the pressure applied to the surface. The valve 

member lifts away from the seating when the pressure applied to the 
surface is reduced by fuel pressure acting on a further surface defined on 

the valve member. The valve element (28) is connected to the armature 
(29) of a solenoid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel injection nozzle for supplying fuel to an 
internal combustion engine and comprising a nozzle body in which is 
defined a blind bore, a seating defined adjacent the blind end of the 
bore, valve means movable axially within the bore, the valve means 
being shaped for cooperation with the seating and being movable away 
from the seating to permit fuel to flow past the seating through an outlet 
orifice and the valve means defining a surface against which fuel under 
pressure can act to lift the valve means from the seating. Such nozzles are well known in the art and it is usual for the valve 
means to be biased into engagement with the seating by a strong spring 
and for the surface defined by the valve means to have an area such that 
the force developed on the valve means when fuel under pressure is 
supplied to the nozzle is sufficient to move the valve means against the 
force developed by the spring. The valve means therefore lifts from the 
seating when the fuel pressure attains a predetermined value and 
therefore the timing of fuel delivery to the engine is dependent upon the 
rise in the fuel pressure and the manufacturing tolerances of the nozzle. In order to meet the operating requirements of modern engines it is 
necessary for the timing of fuel delivery to the engine to be carefully 
controlled. This is the case particularly with compression ignition 
engines and the object of the present invention is to provide a fuel 
injection nozzle of the kind specified in which the initiation of fuel 
delivery is determined by a control signal which is supplied to the 
nozzle.  According to the invention in a fuel injection nozzle of the kind 
specified the valve means defines a further surface against which fluid 
under pressure can act to hold the valve means in engagement with the 
seating and there is provided a control element operable by a control 
signal from external of the nozzle, to reduce said fluid pressure when it 
is required to lift the valve means from the seating. According to a further feature of the invention said fluid under pressure 
is fuel which is derived from a fuel inlet of the nozzle. According to a still further feature of the invention the fuel under 
pressure which acts on said further surface of the valve means is supplied 
from said inlet by way of a restrictor. In the accompanying drawings:- 
Figure 1 is a sectional side elevation of one example of a nozzle in 
accordance with the invention, Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 taken
