<ABSTRACT>
An automated chemical analyzer (8) includes an automated conveyor apparatus (10) for receiving a variety of sizes of test tubes, cuvettes, and sample tubes in a standard carrier member (16) receivable into the analyzer. The standard carrier members may be interlocked in ranks and placed side by side in file to replicate the size and handling convenience of conventional test tube racks. However, the conveyor apparatus also provides for receipt of the carriers either as individuals for stat handling (14), or in interlocked ranks, or as rank and file groups for routine handling (20). The interlocked ranks of carriers are automatically unlocked from one another and fed along with the carriers having stat samples therein to a recirculating endless loop conveyor device (34) which conveys the samples to at least one chemical analysis module (40), as well as providing a storage capacity both for samples in testing, and those samples awaiting verification of test results. Carriers with samples on which testing is completed and verified are discharged from the endless loop conveyor device into an off-loading facility (52-58) which again interlocks the carriers and presents them in rank and file groups for subsequent handling like conventional test tube racks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automated chemical 
analyzers, and to conveyor apparatus and methods. 
More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an adaptive, versatile conveyor 
apparatus for feeding individual sample tubes, cells, 
cuvettes, and the like (hereinafter collectively referred 
to as "sample tubes") each held in an individual prismatic 
sample tube carrier, either from associated groups or 
batches which are taken in regular order, or from a stat 
sample area taken with priority; identifying the 
individual sample tubes; conveying and/or temporarily 
storing the individual sample tubes as required; 
transferring the individual sample tubes to and from one 
or more associated analysis modules of the apparatus as 
appropriate; retaining the individual sample tubes in 
temporary storage while test results are obtained, and 
returning the individual sample tubes to associated groups 
in response to an indication that analysis of a particular 
sample is complete and verified as reliable. The present 
invention has particular utility for use in automated 
chemical analyzers and related equipment for analysis and 
testing of blood, physiological fluids, and other 
biological samples.  
 A wide variety of automated chemical analyzers are 
known in the art and are widely used in hospitals, 
clinics, and research laboratories. A particularly 
popular example of such a device is the multi-channel type 
of analyzer in which a series of different tests are 
performed simultaneously and in parallel with one another. 
The typical multi-channel analyzer generally utilizes 
liquid or solid reagents to react with a particular 
constituent present in a sample to result in a change in 
transmissibility, absorption, color, photo-optical 
characteristic or other coligative electrical or physical 
property of the sample. In conjunction with the 
multi-channel analyzer, a photo-optical system and electro 
chemical detector means are employed to determine the 
rate of reaction, or concentration of the constituent in 
the sample, and the like. The usual method employed for performing these 
photometric procedures is to place a portion or aliquot of 
the sample solution in a small cell, tube, or cuvette 
provided with transparent walls, and then to interpose the 
sample solution between a light source and a 
photosensitive detecting element or to flow the sample 
past sensors. In order to perform multiple tests 
simultaneously on each sample most contemporary 
multi-channel analyzers utilize a number of

chute (54), said housing (188) defining also a second 

reference surface (290) as part of said other leg (290) of 
said L-shaped chute (54) and with which an extension of said 

first reference surface (284) would intersect; 
advancer means (300) for moving said off-loading 
individual sample carrier (16) along said first reference 

surface (284) and into engagement with said second reference 
surface (290) to interlink with a preceding off-loading sample 

carrier (16) in an elongate rank; and 
lateral incremental advancer means (310) for moving said 
off-loading sample carrier (16) and any preceding sample 

carriers (16) interlinked therewith an incremental distance 
equal to a prismatic edge dimension of said sample carriers 

(16) along said second reference surface (290); 
whereby said individual off-loading sample carrier (16) 
is aligned with said first reference surface (284) to await 

interlinking with a next-successive off-loading sample carrier 
(16) which is moved along said first reference surface (284) 

laterally of said waiting sample carrier (16) to interlink  
 

therewith and into engagement with said second reference 
surface (290).
