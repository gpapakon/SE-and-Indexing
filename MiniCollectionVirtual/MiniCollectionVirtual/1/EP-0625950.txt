<CLAIMS>
A guarantee closure (1) for closing a container comprising a 
plastics closure cap (2) with a cap end portion (2a) and a cylindrical 

cap wall portion (2b) and a guarantee strip (3) which can be brought 
into positively locking and/or force-locking engagement with the 

container, and at least one desired-tear line (6) for separating the 
guarantee strip (3) from the closure cap (2), characterised in that the 

closure cap (2) and the guarantee strip (3) are parts produced in 
separate successive moulding processes, in particular by injection 

moulding and/or compression moulding, and that the closure cap (2) and 
the guarantee strip (3) are connected with a connecting location (5) 

formed by the second moulding process, the connecting location (5) 
forming the desired-tear line (6). 
A guarantee closure according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the connecting location (5) or the connecting locations (5, 5a, 5b, 5c, 

5d) at which the guarantee strip (3) is moulded on to the closure cap 
(2) is in the form of the desired-tear line (6). 
A guarantee closure according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the guarantee strip (3) is connected to the 

closure cap (2) along a linear connecting location (5). 
A guarantee closure according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the guarantee strip (3) has one or are 

connecting legs (7, 7a, 7b) and that the connecting legs are 
subsequently injection-moulded on the closure cap (2). 
A guarantee closure according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the connecting location or the connecting 

locations (5, 5a, 5b, 5c) between the closure cap (2) and the guarantee 
strip (3) have at least one region with at least one undercut portion 

(8, 14).  
 
A guarantee closure according to claim 4 or claim 5 
characterised in that the connecting location or the connecting 

locations (5a, 5b) between the closure cap (2) and the guarantee strip 
(3) extend inclinedly relative to the cap longitudinal axis and that 

the connecting locations (5a, 5b) are arranged at such an angle to the 
cap longitudinal axis that the force exerted when closing the guarantee 

strip by way of the connecting locations (5a, 5b) is directed 
approximately transversely relative to the connecting location (5a) 

and/or substantially parallel to the connecting location (5b). 
A guarantee closure according to claim 6 characterised in that 
the connecting legs (7a) and/or the connecting locations (5b) extend at 

an angle α of 20° to 45° relative to the cap longitudinal axis. 
A guarantee closure according to claim 7 characterised in that 
the angle α is about 30°. 
A guarantee closure according to one of claims 4 to 8 
characterised in that the connecting legs (7a) are arranged in an 

opening (9) in the cap wall portion (2b). 
A guarantee closure according to one of claims 4 to 9 

characterised in that the connecting locations (5a) extend at an angle 
of about 90° relative to the direction R of the force which is 

transmitted upon closure of the screw cap (2) by the guarantee strip 
(3) by way of the legs (7a). 
A guarantee closure according to one of claims 4 to 10 
characterised in that provided on the screw cap (2) and/or on the 

connecting leg (7a) is at least one support surface (10) for supporting 
the connecting leg to prevent separation and deformation upon being 

fitted on to a container.  
 
A guarantee closure according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that provided on the screw cap (2) and/or on the 

connecting leg (7a) is at least one notch (11, 12) as a prolongation of 
the connecting surface (5a, 5b) to promote the tear-off effect when 

opening the closure cap (2). 
A process for the production of a guarantee closure according 
to one of the preceding claims characterised in that in a second 

moulding operation the guarantee strip (3) is moulded on to the closure 
cap (2) which is prefabricated in a first moulding operation. 
A process according to claim 13 characterised in that the 
guarantee strip (3) is injection moulded in position in an injection 

moulding process. 
A process according to claim 14 characterised in that the 
guarantee strip (3) is moulded in position in a compression moulding 

process.
