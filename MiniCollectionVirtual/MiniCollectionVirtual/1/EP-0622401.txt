<ABSTRACT>
Foamable thermoplastic resin compositions are 
provided having vinyl chloride polymer, a graft 

copolymer having a superstrate grafted to a substrate 
wherein the superstrate has alphamethyl styrene, 

unsaturated nitrile, and unsubstituted styrene 
therein, and the substrate is a butadiene rubber, a 

rubber-free copolymer having alkylmethacrylate, vinyl 
aromatic, and unsaturated nitrile therein, and a 

chemical blowing agent. The foamable thermoplastic 
resin composition may be coextruded with a non-foamed 

thermoplastic resin skin to produce a 
coextruded rigid foamed structure by a process of 

coextruding the skin and foamable thermoplastic 
composition. The composition and process are useful 

for making coextruded rigid foam structures which are 
useful in rigid foam applications such as foamed pipe 

and foamed sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to foamable thermoplastic 
resin compositions, coextruded rigid foam articles, 
and processes for making coextruded rigid foam 
articles, and more particularly relates to foamable 
thermoplastic resin compositions having a vinyl 
chloride polymer, a graft copolymer, a rubber-free 
copolymer, and a chemical blowing agent, coextruded 
rigid foam articles made therefrom, and processes for 
making such coextruded rigid foam articles. Polyvinyl chloride compositions comprising graft 
copolymers having a superstrate of alphamethyl 
styrene-unsaturated nitrile-unsubstituted styrene and 
a substrate of butadiene rubber, are known for making 
non-foam articles. Such compositions have exhibited 
increased heat distortion temperatures due to the 
presence of the graft copolymer, but such 
compositions have typically lacked the melt strength 
required for making foamed articles, and thus have 
not contained blowing agents therein or been made 
into rigid foam articles. Additionally, the addition 
of the heat distortion temperature increasing graft 
copolymer into foamable thermoplastic resin 
compositions would not be obvious to one skilled in 
the art due in part to the lack of a need for 
increased heat distortion temperature in typical uses 
for rigid foam vinyl chloride articles, for example,  
 
foam drain pipe, waste pipe, vent pipe and foam sheet 
for construction. Foamable thermoplastic resin compositions 
comprising vinyl chloride polymer, methyl 
methacrylate-styrene-acrylonitrile terpolymer and a 
blowing agent are known, see French published 
application serial no. 89/05,537, filed April 26, 
1989, by inventors Jacky Patric Dominique Des Champs 
and Marc Loibl, but such compositions have typically 
exhibited higher levels of viscosity than are desired 
for coextrusion processes of non-foamed resin skin 
and the foamable compositions which due to pressure 
build ups and excessive shear in such processes can 
lead to heat build up of the compositions due to the 
working torque resulting from the shear, and leading 
to premature foaming of the materials and possible 
degradation of the vinyl chloride polymer resulting 
from the temperature increase. Foamable thermoplastic compositions comprising 
vinyl chloride polymer, butylacrylate rubber-based 
graft copolymers and polymethyl methacrylate rigid 
polymer have been used in coextrusion processes for 
making rigid foam structures, but such materials 
typically exhibit undesirably low impact strengths, 
and elongated cell structures in
