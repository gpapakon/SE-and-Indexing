<ABSTRACT>
A dual output energy regulator comprises a cam body 
137 having a primary cam surface 136 for controlling the 

supply of energy to a load and a track 155 for receiving 
a collar 154 provided with an auxiliary cam surface 152 

for controlling the opening of auxiliary contacts 142, 
144. 

The collar 154 is rotatable relative to the body 
137 and has detents 162,164 for retaining an auxiliary 

cam follower 150 in one of the positions in which the 
contacts 142,144 are either open or closed. A lost 

motion mechanism allows the cam member 137 to rotate by 
about 300Â° from its original position without turning 

the collar at which point, dog teeth 166,168 on the 
collar 154, and cam member 137 engage to move the collar 

to its other position. Movement of the cam member 137 
in the other direction does not result in movement of 

the collar until the dog teeth 166,168 again engage and 
return the collar 154 to its original position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to energy regulators
for controlling the supply of electrical energy to
electrical loads such as cooker hot plates or grills.Typically, energy regulators comprise a micro-switch
having a set of switch contacts arrangeable in
the electrical supply circuit to the electrical load, a
snap-acting switch contact arm operatively associated
with a bimetallic actuator, and electrically energisable
heating means associated with the bimetallic actuator.
In such constructions, electrical power is initially
supplied to the load and to the heating means which may
be connected either in parallel or in series with the
load. The heating means heats the bimetallic actuator,
causing it to deform to the point where it causes snap-action
of the contact arm to open the switch contacts
and interrupt the power supply to both the load and the
heating means. The bimetallic actuator then cools and
deforms in the opposite direction to the point where the
contact arm undergoes reverse snap-action to close the
contacts once more, whereupon the cycle recommences.
Thus such regulators operate on the principle of
supplying power to the load over a proportion of an
operating cycle, the proportion being settable by
control means coupled in use to a user actuated control
member e.g. a knob or spindle. The control means
normally comprises a rotary control cam member, against
which a cam follower, for example provided on an ambient
compensating bimetal coupled to the bimetallic actuator,
abuts. Such constructions are for convenience
hereinafter referred to as "energy regulators of the
kind described".Frequently it is desired to provide a "full load"
or "part load" facility in an electrical appliance, for
example a "split ring" or "split grill" in a cooker to 
allow a portion of a hot plate to be used for heating a
small saucepan or for using a part only of the grill to
grill a small amount of food. In such a case, a dual
output is provided from the energy regulator. The first
output is connected to a primary load which is intended
to be energised whether the load is on a "full load" or
"part load" setting. The second output, however, is
connected to an auxiliary load which is intended to be
energised in addition to the primary load only in the
"full load" setting through an auxiliary set of switch
contacts. The position of the auxiliary contacts is
controlled by an auxiliary cam surface engaged by an
auxiliary cam follower, and when the auxiliary contacts
are closed, the auxiliary load will also be

An energy regulator for controlling the supply of
electrical energy to a load, comprising microswitch

means (4) arrangeable in the electrical supply circuit
to said load and having a set of primary contacts (16,

18), a bimetallic actuator (1) operatively associated
with said microswitch, electrical heating means (22) for

heating said actuator to the point where it deflects
sufficiently to open said primary contacts, a control

means comprising a rotary cam member (137) for
determining the degree of deflection of said actuator

required to operate said switch, said regulator further
having a first output (114) for connection to a primary

load and a second output (148) for connection to an
auxiliary load, intended to be energised selectively in

addition to said primary load in dependence on the
condition of auxiliary contacts controlled by an

auxiliary cam surface (152), through an auxiliary cam
follower (150), characterised in that the cam member

(137) of the regulator comprises a primary cam surface
(136) for setting the operating point of the regulator

and an auxiliary cam surface (152) movable relative to
said primary cam surface, for controlling the opening

and closing of the auxiliary set of contacts, and a lost
motion mechanism arranged between the control means of

the regulator and the auxiliary cam surface such that
over movement of said control means in one direction

from a first predetermined position to a second
predetermined position said auxiliary cam surface (152)

remains in a first angular position wherein said
auxiliary contacts are in a first state, movement of

said control means in the same direction beyond said
second predetermined position to a third predetermined

position moving said auxiliary cam surface into a second
angular position so as to move said auxiliary contacts

to a second state, whereafter over movement of said 
control member and cam member in the opposite direction

over a predetermined range, said auxiliary cam surface
remains in said second position and said auxiliary

contacts remain in said second state, and in that the
primary cam surface (136) and the auxiliary cam surface
