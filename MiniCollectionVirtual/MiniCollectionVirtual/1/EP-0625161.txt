<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for recovering a highly pure virus-inactivated factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex from cryoprecipitate by means of anion exchanger chromatography.In EP-A-0 238 701 there has been described a process for the production of a high-purity non-infectious antihemophilia factor, wherein fibrinogen, globulins, albumins and other interfering components are removed from the cryoprecipitate by means of an ethanol precipitation. The accumulation from the cryoprecipitate is necessary because the factor VIII is contained in the material only in very low amounts. However, this accumulation step impairs-the AHF content in the final product. The processes hitherto known for the production of factor VIII do only produce very low amounts of active substance. Thus, by the application of the factor VIII produced via the conventional route, the patient will be burdened with large amounts of antigenic substances. This procedure is not without risk. Therefore, there have been plenty of attempts for further accumulating the factor VIII by separation operations. Thus, it has been attempted to obtain products having a higher specific activity by means of affinity chromatography using animal antibodies directed against factor VIII. However, this technique is very expensive and cost-intensive. On the other hand, this technique is also not quite unobjectionable, because also a certain amount of animal protein is always eluted from the column in each chromatographic separation.EP-A-343 275 describes a process for producing a highly pure virus-free antihemophilia factor wherein a cryoprecipitate comprising factor VIII is treated with aluminum hydroxide and with biologically compatible organic solvents/detergents, in a preferred embodiment followed by further gel permeation chromatography using ion exchanger material. EP-A-0 367 840 describes a chromatography material based on copolymers of oligoethyleneglycols, glycidyl methacrylates and pentaerythritol dimethacrylates as being particularly suitable for producing a highly pure virus-free factor VIII.WO 90/14886 describes a medium for separating proteins. The material disclosed therein describes a water-insoluble matrix bearing a plurality of polyamine moieties, said polyamine moieties comprising at least 3 basic nitrogen atoms, and said nitrogen atoms being separated by a chain of at least two carbon atoms positioned therebetween, with at least 5 of such carbon atoms being present in the case that each polyamine group has a total of 3
