<ABSTRACT>
A long wavelength (6 to 20Âµm) phototransistor is 
described which has n-doped silicon as emitter and collector 

regions bracketing a base region having a quantum well 
structure made up of alternating layers of p-doped silicon 

germanium and undoped silicon. The silicon germanium layer 
adjacent to the emitter region is thicker and has a higher 

percentage of germanium in order to provide a quantum well 
that is wider and deeper than the other quantum wells in the 

base region thereby resulting in a larger current and 
optical gain. The silicon barrier layer of the quantum well 

closest to the collector region is p-doped in order to 
reduce the leakage current of the base-collector junction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phototransistors and 
more particularly to phototransistors that are useful in the 
long wavelength infrared region, that is for wavelengths of 
about 6 to 20 micrometers. Heterojunction bipolar phototransistors are well 
known as devices that can be used to produce an output 
electrical current in response to the presence of light. 
See, for example, the article entitled "Gain of a 
Heterojunction Bipolar Phototransistor" by Naresh Chand et 
al. in IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Vol ED-32, No. 
3, March 1985, pages 622-627. In the Chand et al. article, 
a phototransistor is described wherein the incident light 
passes through a transparent emitter and is absorbed in the 
base, the depletion region between the base and the 
collector, and the neutral collector. The electron-hole 
pairs generated in the depletion region and within the 
diffusion lengths of the minority carriers in the base and 
collector are separated and collected by the field of the 
base-collector junction leading to a current flow in an 
external circuit. The holes are swept into the base and are 
accumulated near the emitter-base junction due to a large 
potential barrier in the valence band at the heterointerface 
until they recombine with injected electrons from the 
emitter. To maintain the charge-neutrality condition in the 
base, a large injection of electrons occurs from the emitter 
into the base resulting in a large electron-current flow 
from the emitter to the collector. While phototransistors 
of the type in the Chand et al. article have provided 
greater gain than a simple photodiode, they have not 
provided a light detection that is useful in the infrared  
 
region of about 6 to 20 micrometers wavelength. One form of a detector which is useful in the 
desired range of wavelengths is the quantum well infrared 
detector wherein p-doped Si1-xGex layers are grown between 
undoped Si barrier layers in a quantum well structure in 
order to form multiple quantum wells primarily in the 
valence band. The term quantum well structure in this 
context refers to stacks of ultrathin layers of 
semiconductor material where the dimension of the ultrathin 
layer is sufficiently small such that the electron is 
considered to be essentially confined in that dimension by 
the energy barriers created by the differences in bandgaps. 
A description of this type of a photodetector can be found, 
for example, in the article entitled "Si1-xGex/Si multiple 
quantum well infrared detector", by R. P. G.
