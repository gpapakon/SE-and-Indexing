<ABSTRACT>
Additive (I) comprises residues from TiO2 prodn. and one or more of coal, coal-contg. residues, Fe, Fe2O3, Fe- or Fe2O3-contg. residues. (I) comprises 50-95 wt.% residues from TiO2 prodn. and 5-50 wt.% coal; or 10-80 wt.% residues from TiO2 prodn., 5-70 wt.% coal and 5-40 wt.% Fe- and/or Fe2O3-contg. residues. (I) is in the form of a sintered body.
