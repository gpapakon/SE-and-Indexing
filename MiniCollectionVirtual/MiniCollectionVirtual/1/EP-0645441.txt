<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for changing the solvent composition in a 
solvent recovery system of a dewaxing apparatus, depending on the type of 

stock oil, by introducing a part of dry solvent into a wet solvent tank to thereby 
increase or decrease a concentration of MEK in the wet solvent used as a 

primary solvent for initially mixing with the stock oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for changing 
the composition of a solvent in a solvent recovery system of a dewaxing 
apparatus, and in particular to a method and apparatus applicable to the 
solvent recovery system of an MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) dewaxing apparatus, 
for increasing or decreasing the concentration of MEK in a primary solvent 
which is initially mixed with the stock oil. Heretofore with known MEK dewaxing apparatus, wax and lubricating oil 
is produced by mixing a solvent mixture of MEK and toluene with stock oil, and 
then cooling the mixture and filtering. In such MEK dewaxing apparatus, the different properties of the MEK 
and toluene are used in producing the wax and lubricating oil from the stock oil. More specifically, the properties of MEK and toluene are such that MEK 
does not readily dissolve wax, while toluene readily dissolves both lubricating 
oil and wax. These properties are used in the production of low freezing point 
lubricating oil where the wax is first crystallized out from the stock oil in the 
cooling process and then filtered out with a filter. The constituent proportions of the MEK and toluene are thus extremely 
important factors in the operation of the dewaxing apparatus. If the proportion of MEK in the solvent is larger, the dewaxing 
temperature difference becomes smaller, and the lubricating oil yield is also 
improved. However if the MEK proportion is too great then oil separation can 
occur during filtering.  Normally the wax of low viscosity stock oil is n-paraffin based which is 
easily separated from the oil constituent, and hence the proportion of MEK is 
made large. With high viscosity stock oil however, the wax is mainly i-paraffin 
which is difficult to separate from the oil constituent, and hence the proportion 
of toluene is made large. Since the oil is dissolved in the toluene, the wax must 
then be separated out by precipitation. Therefore under actual operation of the dewaxing apparatus, for 
optimum conditions as shown in FIG. 2 with for example the low viscosity stock 
oil such as S/L (Sumatra light type stock oil) - No. 10, 20 (SAE equivalent), or 
HDC (hydro-cracking type stock oil) No. 70 pale, 10 (SAE equivalent), the 
proportion of MEK is made approximately 65%, while with high viscosity stock 
oil such as HDC - No. 20 (SAE equivalent) and oils in wax de-oiling operations 
etc., the proportion of MEK is made approximately 55%. With an ordinary dewaxing apparatus, since similar kinds of stock oil 
distilled from
