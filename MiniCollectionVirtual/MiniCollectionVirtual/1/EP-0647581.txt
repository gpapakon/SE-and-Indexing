<ABSTRACT>
Screw conveyer (1) for bulk material, the outlet (5) of which is separated from an outlet space (7), in which a higher gas pressure than at the inlet (4) of the screw conveyer (1) prevails, by a non-return flap (8) which is urged into the closing position by a resilient force (14). The operating behaviour of the conveyor is improved, in particular the drive power and wear are reduced, by the provision of a damper (13) for damping the movement of the non-return flap (8), particularly for damping the opening movement.

<CLAIMS>
Worm conveyor for bulk material having an outlet (5) from an outlet area (7) with a
higher gas pressure than at the inlet (4) of the worm conveyor (1), which is separated

by a check flap (8) which is pushed into its closing position via a flexible force (14),
characterized by a damper (13) for damping of the movement of the check flap (8)

which only reacts or which reacts increasingly against the opening movement of the
flap than against the closing movement.
