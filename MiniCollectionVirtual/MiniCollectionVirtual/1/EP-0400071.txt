<DESCRIPTION>
 LAMINAR POLYMERIC SHEETThis invention relates to a laminar polymer sheet and to products made from such a sheet.Published EP-A-0213774 describes methods of making uniaxially electrically conductive articles by making through-holes in a laminar polymer sheet, plating metal in the holes, and removing surface laminae from the sheet to leave the plated metal in each through-hole projecting beyond the main surfaces of the sheet. These conductive articles are com erically valuable as compl iant electrical connection interfaces, for example for connecting microcir- cuit chips to other elements in an electronic device. The through-holes can be made conveniently small (preferably not more than 200 micrometres diameter) and may be close-packed so that random positioning of the article between opposed connection sites produces electrical connection when the sites are brought into contact with the opposite main sur¬ faces of the article. Other forms of such articles are described in copending British Patent Applications 8802567, 8802565, 8802568, 8815447.1, 8819895.7, and 8823053.7, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference .In view of the wide use of polyimide materials in microelectronic devices, it is desirable to use polyimides for the uniaxially conductive articles, but this leads to problems in selecting suitable materials for the removable surface 1 ami nae .The present invention relates to a novel laminar structure which is useful for various purposes, and is espe- 

cially advantageous for making the aforementioned uniaxially conductive articles.The invention accordingly provides a laminar sheet comprising a layer of polyimide material laminated in direct contact with a layer of amorphous, preferably amorphous aro¬ matic, polyamide material.It will be understood that references to sheets include elongate tape-like sheets and other forms of substantially continuous laminar structures, in which indi¬ vidual laminae are preferably homogeneous. For the purpose of making the aforesaid uniaxially electrically conductive sheets, it is preferable to use a sheet with each of the two main surfaces of the layer of polyimide material laminated in direct contact with a layer of aromatic polyamide nrat.erial . It may be convenient in many cases that the polyimide layer is substant ally co-extensive with the polyamide layer(s).References to the respective layers being "laminated" do not imply any particular method of making the laminar structure.
