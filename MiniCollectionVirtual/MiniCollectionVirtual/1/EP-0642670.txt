A device for measuring rotary motions which essentially 
consists of a signal generator ring (9, 31) coupled to the 

part performing the rotary motion, a stationary sensor (10, 
32, 35) generating an electric signal representing the 

rotary motion of the signal ring, and a sensor holder,
characterized
 in that the sensor (10, 32, 35) 
is designed in the form of a plug or plug-like component and 

the sensor holder is designed in the form of a stationary 
sensor-accommodating housing (11, 23, 34) which accommodates 

the sensor, positions the sensor proximate the signal 
generator ring and maintains it in this position. 
A device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the sensor (10, 32, 35) 
is positioned and held in the sensor-accommodating housing 

(11, 23, 34) by a snug fit, press fit, click-in mechanism, 
and a plug connection or the like. 
A device as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2,
characterized
 in that, in the area of the 
signal generator ring (9, 31), the sensor-accommodating 

housing (11, 23, 34) has a recess which establishes or 
improves the operative contact between the signal generator 

ring and the sensor (10, 32, 35). 
A device as claimed in anyone of claims 1 through 3,
characterized
 in that the sensor-accommodating 
housing (11, 34) is fastened to a lateral flange (12, 36) of  

 
steel which is connected with the stationary axle of the 

measuring device. 
A device as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the angular position of 
the sensor-accommodating housing and, thus, of the sensor in 

the plane of rotation is fixed by one or several positioning 
lips or ribs (14, 37) in the lateral flange (12, 36), which 

engage corresponding recesses when the parts are assembled, 
or by similar measures. 
A device as claimed in anyone of claims 1 through 5,
characterized
 in that the device is designed 
as an active or passive wheel bearing sensor, and the signal 

generator ring (9, 31) consists of evenly distributed teeth 
or recesses on a wheel bearing ring, which rotates with the 

wheel, and wherein the sensor holder (11, 23, 34) is mounted 
on respectively the stationary wheel axle (5) or a 

stationary part (1) of the wheel support or wheel bearing. 
A device as claimed in claim 6,
characterized
 in that a stationary protective 
housing (13) is provided which partially or completely 

surrounds the signal generator ring (9, 31) and houses the 
sensor-accommodating housing (11) and which, by way of a 

lateral flange, a ring (12), a disk or the like, is 
connected to the stationary wheel axle (5) and/or the 

stationary part (1) of the wheel bearing. 
A device as claimed in claim 6 or in claim 7,
characterized
 in that the sensor (10, 32, 35)  
 

is designed in the form of an oblong body, such as that of a 
pin with a round, an angular, or a rounded angular 

cross-section, or in the form of a corresponding pin with a 
stepped cross-section. 
A device as claimed in claim 8,
characterized
 in that the sensor (10, 32, 35) 
and the sensor-accommodating housing (11, 23, 34) are 

provided with a latch (19), a stop spring (20) and with 
corresponding recesses for the engagement with the latch or 

stop spring. 
A device as claimed in anyone of claims 1 through 9,
characterized
 in that the sensor (10) is 
positioned by the sensor-accommodating housing (11) in a 

direction parallel to the axis of rotation or the wheel 
bearing axis. 
A device as claimed in anyone of claims 1 through 9,
characterized
 in that the sensor (32, 35) is 
positioned by the sensor-accommodating housing (32, 34) at 

an acute angle with regard to the axis of rotation or the 
wheel bearing axis.
