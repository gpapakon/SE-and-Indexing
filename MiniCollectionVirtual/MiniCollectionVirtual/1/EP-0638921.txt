<ABSTRACT>
In-line beam systems (14) with self-converging deflecting units (deflectors) (15) have the disadvantage that during the deflection of the outer beams (R, B) vertical bars of the colours red are wider in the 3 DEG  DEG  deflection region than vertical bars of this colour in the 9 DEG  DEG deflection region. The conditions, just described, are precisely reversed for the colour blue. In addition, it is found in these systems that, when modifying a grid 3 voltage which has been determined to be optimal, a convergence error occurs which is designated as grid 3 convergence running. According to the invention, a beam-producing system (14) is specified in which the s-distances (spacings) (A1, A3) in grid 1 (18) in grid 2 (19) and in the upper part (20.4) of grid 3 (20) are identical and the s-distance (A2) in the lower part (20.1) of grid 3 (20) is greater than the s-distance (A1) in grid 1 and smaller than the s-distance (A4) in grid 4 (21). In such a system, the vertical bars of the colours blue and red are largely homogenized in the 9 DEG  DEG  or 3 DEG  DEG  deflection region of the monitor (11). In addition, such a system (14) is resistant in terms of grid 3 convergence running when the grid 3 voltage is changed.
