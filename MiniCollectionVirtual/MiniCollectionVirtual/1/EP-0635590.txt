<ABSTRACT>
In a double-apron drawframe for spinning machines with a fibre-bundling zone which follows the pair of withdrawal rollers of the main drawing zone and which is followed by the pair of delivery rollers, during the amalgamation the fibre composite (FB) runs through an essentially plane stage, in which the fibre composite is supported on one side by a transport plane and a suction-air stream acts on the fibre composite (FB) through this transport plane approximately in the width of the desired amalgamation. The drawframe has, between the pair of withdrawal rollers and the pair of delivery rollers, a pneumatic compacting device formed by a perforated apron which is at the same time the transport plane for the fibre composite and which is subjected to suction by a suck-off device.

A process for bundling a fibre composite (FC) which has been finish-drafted in a double apron drafting device and, subsequent, to the drafting process, is gathered together in a fibre bundling zone and twisted together to Form a yarn, wherein the fibre composite (FC) leaving the pair of output rollers (3, 3') of the drafting device is subjected in the fibre bundling zone to a suction air stream directed transversely to the conveying direction,
characterized in that
(b1) the finish-drafted fibre composite (FC), while being gathered together, passes through an essentially planar distance,
(b2) in which the fibre composite (FC) is supported on one side through the planar conveying means (6),
(b3) wherein the suction air stream acts on the fibre composite (FC) alone
(b4) approximately at the desired width of the gathering together
(b5) while being drawn through the conveying means,
(b6) so that the fibres of the fibre composite (FC) which are guided only on one side and exit from the pair of output rollers (3, 3') of the drafting system move freely and are smoothly gathered together by the air stream directed transversely to the conveying direction.

characterized in that
 the circumferential speed ratio between the pair of output rollers (3, 3') and the pair of delivery rollers (5, 5') can be adjusted as a function of crimp of the fibre composite material.

characterized in that
 the speed of the conveying means (6) is dependent upon the speed of the pair of delivery rollers (5, 5').
The process as in one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the gathering together of the fibre composite (FC) is varied by varyinq the intensity of said suction air stream.
The process as in one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 a continuous yarn filament (Y) is introduced directly into the pair of output rollers (3, 3') for the production of a core yarn, said yarn filament passing, along with the fibre composite (FC), through the distance between the pair of output rollers (3, 3') and the pair of delivery rollers (5, 5') and being spun subsequently to form a yarn (YF).
A double apron drafting device for spinning machinery for the implementation of the process as in one or more of claims 1 to 5, having a fibre bundling zone which extends after the pair of output rollers (3, 3') of the main drafting zone and is followed by a pair of delivery rollers (5, 5'), wherein a pneumatic condensation apparatus is arranged between the pair of output rollers (3, 3') and the pair of deliver rollers (5, 5'),
characterized in that
(c1) the pneumatic condensation apparatus includes a perforated belt (6)
(c2) defining the conveying means with an essentially planar conveying surface for the finish-drafted fibre composite (FC) between said pair of output rollers (3, 3') and said pair of delivery rollers (5, 5)
(c3) and supports the finish-drafted fibre composite (FC) on one side,
(c4) wherein the perforated belt is passed around one of the delivery cylinders (5, 5') and extends up to a point close in front of the pair of output rollers (3, 3'),
(c5) and that said condensation apparatus further includes a suction device (62, 67)
(c6) which extends along one side of said perforated belt defining the conveying means opposite said fibre composite (FC) between said pair of output rollers (3, 3') and said pair of delivery rollers (5, 5'),
(c7) and which draws in air through said fibre composite.
