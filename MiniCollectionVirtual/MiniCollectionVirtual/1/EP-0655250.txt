<ABSTRACT>
These compositions find application as an active ingredient in pharmaceutical compositions intended for treating and improving bone disorders such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, functional disturbances associated with calcium movement between the blood and a tissue, postoperative or post-traumatic cicatrisations and calcium leakage due to ageing, as well as for preventing these disorders in healthy subjects. They also find application in food compositions for supplying calcium as nutrient, in compositions intended for improving the calcium binding of nacriferous cells of molluscs, and also in compositions intended for accelerating the process of formation of pearls and arthropods.

<CLAIMS>
Pharmaceutical compositions based on algae and their extracts, intended for the use
as a drug in the treatment or the alleviation or the prevention of the bone diseases such

as osteoporosis, arthrosis, the functional perturbances associated to the movement of
calcium ions between the blood and a tissue, the post-operative or traumatic

cicatrisations as well as the calcic losses due to ageing, 
characterised in that
 they
contain the alga of genus Padina or one of its extracts.
Pharmaceutical compositions according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 the powder of the extract of alga is added to a carrier or a diluent
suitable for the administration through digestive way.
Pharmaceutical compositions according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 the alga of the genus Padina is that called Padina pavonica.
