<ABSTRACT>
A small and inexpensive ultrahigh pressure 
control device wherein first and second 

boosters (1, 2) for pressurizing under an ultrahigh 
pressure the water taken into plunger 

chambers (3a, 3b) by virtue of the reciprocating 
movements of hydraulic cylinders (6a, 6b) 

are connected in parallel to a water discharging 

line (8), wherein first and second three-position 
selector valves (9, 10) are interposed 

between hydraulic pumps (11, 12) in such a 
manner as to reciprocate a hydraulic cylinder 

of each of said boosters, wherein first and second 
forward- and backward-motion sensors (29, 

29', 30, 30') for detecting positions near pressurization 
and intake stroke ends, respectively, 

are provided on said first and second boosters, 
wherein while said first booster (1) is in its pressurization 

stroke, a control section (31) switches 
said second three-position selector valve (10) 

from an intake position to a pre-pressurization 
position in accordance with a signal detected by 

said second backward-motion sensor (30') and 
then switches said first three-position selective 

valve (9) from a pressurization position to an intake 
position and said second three-position selector 

valve (10) from the pre-pressurization position 
to a pressurization position, respectively, 

in accordance with a signal detected by said 
first forward-motion sensor (29), with the same 

switching control being performed while said 
second booster (2) is in its pressurization stroke.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a superhigh 
pressure control system for controlling a booster for 
boosting water sucked into a plunger chamber through a 
reciprocating notion of a hydraulic cylinder to superhigh 
pressure, and water-jet type cutting apparatus 
incorporating the system. Fig. 4 shows a circuit diagram for a conventional 
superhigh pressure control system applicable to water-jet 
type cutting apparatus (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open 
No. 63-39799). The superhigh pressure control system 
comprises a booster 41 including a double acting hydraulic 
cylinder 42 having a piston P and plungers P₁, P₂ arranged 
at opposite sides thereof and fitted respectively in water-pressurizing 
plunger chambers C₃, C₄, and ports at ends of 
the plunger chambers C₃, C₄ which are connected in parallel 
to a water supply line 46 of a water supply pump 45 via 
suction check valves 43, 44, the ports being also connected 
in parallel via discharge check valves 47, 48 to an  
 
superhigh pressure water discharge line 49 equipped 
sequentially with an accumulator 50, a nozzle on-off valve 
51, and a jet nozzle 52. A two-position directional 
control valve 54 for switching the reciprocating motion of 
the piston is provided between the respective ports at 
opposite ends of a cylinder chamber of the hydraulic 
cylinder 42 and a hydraulic pump 53. Air nozzles 57, 58 
are fixed adjacent the jet nozzle 52 and in slightly spaced 
apart relation in the directions of movement (designated by 
arrows X, Y) of a moving carriage 55 on which is carried a 
material to be cut 56, the air nozzles being connected to 
an air pressure source 61 via on-off valves 59, 60. Relief 
valves 65, 66 are respectively disposed between the water 
supply line 46 and a water tank 62 and between a main line 
63 for the hydraulic pump 53 and an oil tank 64. When the hydraulic pump 53 is actuated with the 
two-position directional control valve 54 set to assume a 
symbol position V₁, hydraulic oil is supplied to a cylinder 
chamber C₁ and the hydraulic oil in a cylinder chamber C₂ is 
discharged into the oil tank 64, so that the piston P 
shifts to the right side and the water in the plunger 
chamber C₄ is pressurized by the plunger P₂ to be boosted in 
proportion to the ratio of sectional area of the piston P 
to the plunger P₂. The water which is boosted by the 
booster 41 to superhigh pressure is ejected from the jet  
 
nozzle 52 to the material 56 to be cut after passing 
through the check valve 48, accumulator 50, and the nozzle 
on-o
