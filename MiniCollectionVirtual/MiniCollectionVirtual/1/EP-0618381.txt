<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flexible transmission 
or transport chain, in particular of the enmeshed 

type. It is formed by a series of chain links (1) 
aligned one to another, in which each link (1) is 

connected to contiguous links (1) by a hinge pivot 
(7), and is thus capable of rotating about the 

axes (X-Y) of the pivots (7). Each of the axes. 
(X-Y) is skewed with respect to the two closest 

axes (Y-X) to it. The chain can thus curve in any 
way and is utilizable for example as a tranmission 

organ of motion in mechanical devices having 
coplanar or skewed axes, as well as a transport 

chain associated to motorizations of conveyor 
belts, grid conveyors, roller conveyors, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flexible transmission 
or transport chain. More specifically, the flexible chain can be used 
for transmitting motion among components of 
mechanical devices and, in a simple case, between 
a gearing keyed on a drive shaft to a gearing 
mounted on a driven shaft. In a further guise, the invention can be used as a 
transporting organ in belt-, roller- and grid-type 
conveyors and the like. The prior art teaches enmeshed-drive transmission 
and transport organs (leaving aside friction-drive 
organs, which present considerable functional 
limitations), which comprise traditional chains, 
formed by a series of chain elements reciprocally 
hinged one to another and rotatable about always-parallel 
axes. Prior art transmission and transport chains 
exhibit some drawbacks which are summarized 
hereunder, with a) referring to their use as  
 
transmission organs and b) to their use as 
transport organs: 
a) traditional chains can only work in one plane. 
Thus, if there should be differing motorizations 
having axes which are not perpendicular to the 
work plane of the chain it is necessary to use 
devices enabling such motorizations to be used, 
such as perpendicular return groups, conical 
couplings, secondary shafts for transmitting 
motion to other organs, and so on. Thus the drawback is substantially that these 
known-type chains are not able to reach any organ 
on any plane. If there are several organs on 
different planes, more than one chain is needed: 
one for each plane, in fact, as well as at least 
one shaft, one support and a means for imparting 
motion to the plane containing the chain. b) Transport is possible only with chains having 
increased play among their constituent components 
(internal and external link plates, link bushes, 
enmeshing rollers etc.) such that the chains have 
a curved configuration with respect to their lie 
plane and thus can follow a curved trajectory, a 
consequence being very elevated resulting 
friction, both between the internal and external  
 
plates of the chain and between the chain itself 
and the running guides. Obviously, as in a), the chain motion can only 
take place in one lie plane. An essential aim of the invention is thus to 
obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks evident in 
the prior art, by providing a flexible 
transmission or transport organ formed by a series 
of chain links aligned one to another, and in 
which each link is connected to contiguous 
elements by a hinge, and is thus capable of 
rotating about the axes of

<CLAIMS>
A flexible transmission or transport chain formed 
by a series of aligned chain links (1), in which 

each of said series of aligned links (1) is 
connected to contiguous links (1) by a hinge (2), 

and is thus capable of rotating about axes (X-Y) 
of contiguous hinges (2), in which each axis is 

skewed with respect to the two closest axes to it, 
and in which each of the hinges is equidistanced 

from its two neighboring hinges. 
A chain as in claim 1, characterised in that each 
of the chain lnks (1) is formed by a body 

exhibiting at least a first through hole and at 
least a projecting portion provided with a second 

through hole having a skewed axis with respect to 
the axis of the first hole, the said first and 

second through-holes being aimed at receiving the 
articulation pivots of the chains. 
A chain as in claim 2, characterised in that each 
of the pivots (7) exhibits two equal portions (20) 

projecting from opposite sides of the body (3). 
A chain as in claim 3, characterised in that each 
projecting portion (20) is externally equipped 

with a roller (13) coaxial to and idly rotatable 
about said projecting portion (20). 
A chain as in claim 2, characterised in that means 
for transporting objects are associated to each 

said pivot (7). 
A chain as in claim 5, characterised in that the 
means for transporting objects are conveyor 

rollers (16). 
A chain as in claim 6, characterised in that the 
conveyor rollers (16) are associated to module 

gears (17), said gears being coaxial to the 
conveyor rollers (16). 
A chain as in claim 6, characterised in that the 
conveyor rollers (16) are equipped at an end with 

a support wheel (24). 
A chain as in claim 5, characterised in that the 
means for transporting objects are flat elements

first through hole (4) and the second through hole

can be neared to or distanced from a contiguous 

link (1), each pivot (7) being inserted in the 
slot (22). 
A chain as in claim 10, characterised in that it 
is associated parallel to a like chain such as to 

form a conveyor organ able to move along curved 
trajectories, the slots (22) permitting a take-up 

of shortenings or lengthenings due to different 
degrees of curvature of each chain. 
A chain as in claim 10, comprising a means for 
traction or distancing a link from a neighboring 

link, such that a nearing or distancing of a link 
to a neighboring link is achieved.
