<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is a process for producing textile floor coverings in motor vehicles by (a) spreading a mixture of foam flakes and a self-curing binder (absorption foam) (2) in a shaped floor pan of the motor vehicle (1), in a desired layer thickness pattern, (b) pressing the possibly premoulded textile floor covering (4) fitted with a heavy foil (3) on the mixture of foam flakes and self-curing binder (2), adjusting the desired foam flake density, (c) activating the binder and (d) bonding the mixture of foam flakes and self-curing binder (2) to the heavy foil (3) of the textile floor covering. The invention makes it possible to attain an even distribution over the entire volume of the absorption foam (2) on the back of the floor covering.

A process for the preparation of textile floor coverings in 
motor vehicles by 


(a) knife coating a mixture (2) of foam off-cuts and a 
self-curing binder in a matrix form of the floor panel 

of motor vehicle (1) in a desired layer thickness 
profile; 
(b) applying by pressing the optionally premolded textile 
carpet (4) provided with a heavy layer (3) on said 

mixture (2) while adjusting the desired density of the 
foam off-cuts; 
(c) activating said binder, and 
(d) bonding said mixture (2) to said heavy layer (3) of 
the textile carpet. 
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
mixture (2) of from 70 to 99% by volume of foam off-cuts 

and from 1 to 30% by volume of binder is knife coated. 
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
mixture of from 75 to 90% by volume of foam off-cuts and 

from 10 to 25% by volume of binder is knife coated. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that foam off-cuts having a size of from 

1 to 30 mm are employed. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a phenol resin, a one-component 

polyurethane, or a latex emulsion, optionally filled with  
 

polyolefin fibers, in particular polypropylene fibers, is 
used as said binder. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that said binder is activated by action of 

temperature, water vapor and/or pressure. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that an EPDM heavy sheet filled with up to 

70% by weight of filler contents is used as said heavy 
layer (3). 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that said mixture (2) on one hand and said 

heavy layer (3) on the other hand are bonded together by 
the self-curing of said binder, without an intermediate 

adhesive layer. 
The process according to one or more of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that said mixture (2) is activated prior 

to applying said textile carpet (4) provided with heavy 
layer (3) and the bonding between said mixture (2) and said 

heavy layer (3) is realized by means of an adhesive layer. 
The process according to claim 9, characterized by using a 
hot-melt adhesive, an optionally heat-activatable polyethylene 

adhesive, a polypropylene adhesive and/or a latex 
adhesive as said adhesive layer. 
The process according to one or more of the claims 1 to 10, 
characterized by using a backside coated velours or needled 

felt layer as said textile carpet (4). 
A textile floor covering for motor vehicles, obtainable by 
the process according to one or more of claims 1 to 11, 

comprising the layers, in order: 

(a) foam off-cuts in a self-curing binder;  
 
(b) heavy layer (3); and 
(c) textile carpet (4); 
 
wherein the bonding between said mixture (2) and heavy 

layer (3) and said textile carpet is optionally realized by 
means of an adhesive layer.
