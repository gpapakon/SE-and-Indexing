<ABSTRACT>
A self-service checkout system provides 
communication between a store employee (30) and customers 

(24) at a plurality of self-service checkout counters (11). 
Each checkout counter (12) includes a terminal (17), a bar 

code scanner (18), and a communication device (22). The 
communication device (22) includes a monitor, a speaker 

microphone for enabling a customer (24) to listen and speak 
to the store employee (30), a camera for allowing the store 

employee (30) to watch the customer (24), and a card reader 
for accepting payment. The system also includes a help and 

security desk (14) manned by the store employee (30) which 
includes a terminal (27), a monitor for viewing a customer 

(24), a speaker microphone for enabling the store 
employee (30) to listen and speak to a customer (24), and a 

controller which allows the store employee to select one of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to checkout systems 
and more specifically to a self-service checkout system. Labour is a major cost in most point-of-sale 
environments, such as retail and grocery establishments. In 
fact, labour costs may account for as much as eighty percent 
of the cost of completing a sale. On the other hand, 
equipment costs may reach only about five percent of the 
cost of completing a sale. Traditionally, checkout systems have included 
islands for servicing one lane and one customer per island 
at a time. These systems have been limited to full-service 
operation, which requires that each island be manned by at 
least a point-of-sale operator or checkout clerk. The 
operator scans, weighs, and bags items, and accepts payment. 
Such systems have the disadvantage that they are costly to 
operate. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a self-service checkout system which saves labour 
costs. According to the invention there is provided a checkout 
system characterized by a plurality of self-service checkout 
counters, each including a terminal, scanner means coupled 
to said terminal for scanning merchandise items, and a card 
reader coupled to said terminal for reading customer payment 
cards; a station separate from said self-service checkout 
counters and arranged to be manned by a store employee; and 
a communication system for monitoring self-service customers 
by the store employee and for enabling communication between 
the self-service customers and the store employee. One embodiment of the invention will now be described 
by way of example with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:-  Fig. 1 is a plan view of a checkout system in 
accordance with the present invention; and Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a communication 
system linking each checkout counter to a manned help and 
security desk. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, the system 10 of 
the present invention includes self-service checkout 
counters 12, and a station, separate from the self-checkout 
counters 12, which is arranged to be manned by a store 
employee 30 and which is formed by a help and security desk 
14. The self-checkout counters 12 each include a conveyor 
belt 16, a terminal 17, a bar-code scanner and scale device 
18, a bag area 20, and a communication device 22. The 
scanner and scale devices 18 and the communication devices 
22 are coupled to the terminals 17. The help and security desk 14 includes a terminal 
27 and a communication device 28. The communication device 
28 is
