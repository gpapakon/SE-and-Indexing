<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a novel and improved method and system for communicating a frame of information according to a discontinuous transmit format. In particular, the present invention describes a method of transmitting eighth rate speech or data frames employing transmit gating and energy scaling which simultaneously reduces the battery usage of a variable rate wireless communication device (50), increases the capacity of the reverse link and provides reliable communication of the eighth rate frames. In the present invention, four methods are presented for transmitting an eighth rate data frame in which half of the frame is gated out and the remaining data is transmitted at nominal transmission energy to accomplish the aforementioned goals. In addition, a power control system identifies forward link power control bits that have been gated out by the remote station (50) and inhibits adjustment of the transmission energy in response to that identification.

METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING TRANSMISSION GATEDCOMMUNICATION SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONI. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to communications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel and improved method and apparatus for transmitting variable rate data in a wireless communication system.II. Description of the Related Art The use of code division multiple access (CDMA) modulation techniques is one of several techniques for facilitating communications in which a large number of system users are present. Other multiple access communication system techniques, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA) are known in the art. However, the spread spectrum modulation techniques of CDMA have significant advantages over these modulation techniques for multiple access communication systems. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,901,307, entitled "SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS", assigned to the assignee of the present invention, and incorporated by reference herein. The use of CDMA techniques in a multiple access communication system is further disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,103,459, entitled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR GENERATING SIGNAL WAVEFORMS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM", assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.CDMA by its inherent nature of being a wideband signal offers a form of frequency diversity by spreading the signal energy over a wide bandwidth. Therefore, frequency selective fading affects only a small part of the CDMA signal bandwidth. Space or path diversity is obtained by providing multiple signal paths through simultaneous links from a mobile user through two or more cell-sites. Furthermore, path diversity may be obtained by exploiting 

the multipath environment through spread spectrum processing by allowing a signal arriving with different propagation delays to be received and processed separately. Examples of path diversity are illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 5,101,501 entitled "METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING A SOFT HANDOFF IN COMMUNICATIONS IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM", and U.S. Patent No. 5,109,390 entitled "DIVERSITY RECEIVER IN A CDMA CELLULAR TELEPHONE SYSTEM", both assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated by reference herein.
