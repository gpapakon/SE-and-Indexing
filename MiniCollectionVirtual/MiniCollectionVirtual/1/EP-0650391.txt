<ABSTRACT>
A solid/liquid separation apparatus in which a downwardly-inclined separator screen is supported across the open front face of a liquid collection chamber. The screen and chamber are mounted in an outer frame having spaced side walls. The screen has separate upper and lower sections and is adjustably mounted on at least one of the side walls at a position intermediate the upper and lower ends of the screen so that it can be moved inwardly and outwardly in a direction transverse to the plane of the screen to adjust the relative vertical angles of screen sections. In one version, the upper and lower screen sections are separate screens and are adjustable via separate adjustment mechanisms.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SOLID/LIQUID SEPARATION APPARATUS WITH ADJUSTABLE SCREENCROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a Continuation-In-Part of Application Serial No. 07/706,888 filed May 29, 1991, pending.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to apparatus for separating solids from a solid/liquid mixture, and is particularly concerned with separating apparatus for removing solids from a flowing slurry or sludge. Screen assemblies are commonly used in separating solid/liquid mixtures in sewage plants, the paper-making industry, and other processing industries. In U.S. Patent No. 3,452,876 of Ginaven, for example, de-watering equipment is described in which a downwardly inclined screen is supported in a frame. Slurry is supplied to the top end of the screen, and flows down the screen towards its lower end. As the slurry travels down the screen, liquid falls down through the screen openings into a drain chamber behind the screen. The de-watered slurry slides over the end of the screen into a suitable receptacle or onto a conveyer for further treatment'. In this apparatus, different types of slurries having dif erent water content are accommodated by different length screens, with sections of the screen being made longer for slurries which are harder to drain. Thus, a completely different screen unit is typically needed for each type of material to be separated. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide a new and improved screen assembly for a solid/liquid separation apparatus.According to the present invention, a solid/liquid separation apparatus is provided, which comprises an outer support frame having opposite side walls, a downwardly inclined filter screen supported between the side walls, an inlet for directing a solid/liquid mixture to be separated onto the screen at the upper end of the screen so that the mixture flows along the screen towards its lower end, a support member extending transversely across the screen at an intermediate point in its length to divide the screen into separate upper and lower sections, and an adjustment mechanism for moving the support member and attached region of the screen inwardly and outwardly in a direction transverse to the screen to adjust the relative angles of inclination of the upper and lower sections of the screen. In this way, the screen can be adjusted quickly and easily to accommodate different types of materials. Generally, by moving the support member outwardly, the upper section of the screen is

 CLAIMS
1. A solid/liquid separation apparatus, comprising: an outer support frame having spaced side walls; a downwardly-inclined separator screen supported on said support frame between said side walls; inlet means for directing a solid/liquid mixture to be separated onto the upper end of said separator screen to flow downwardly along the screen towards its lower end; at least one support member extending transversely across the screen at a location intermediate its ends to divide the screen into an upper section and a lower section on opposite sides of said support member; and adjustable mounting means for adjustably mounting said screen for movement in a direction transverse to the plane of the screen to adjust the relative vertical angles of the upper and lower screen sections; the adjustable mounting means comprising at least one adjustment screw mechanism having a first part secured to one of said side walls and a second part secured to said screen at a location intermediate the ends of said screen.
2. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, including locking means for releasably locking the support member in a selected position.
3. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, wherein at least one end of said support member comprises an L-shaped portion extending perpendicular to the remainder of the support member and upwardly over the upper edge of the respective side wall, the adjustment screw mechanism being mounted on the outside of said side wall and being secured to the free end of said L-shaped portion. 


 4. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, including adjustable mounting means at each end of said support member for adjustably mounting said support member on the respective side walls.
5. A solid/liquid separation apparatus, comprising: an outer support frame having spaced side walls; a liquid collection chamber between the side walls having an open front face; a downwardly-inclined separator screen assembly supported over the open front face of the liquid collection chamber, the assembly includes at least two separate upper and lower screen sections; hinge means connecting said screen sections together at their adjacent ends; an inlet passageway at an upper end of said upper screen section for directing a solid/liquid mixture or.to the upper end of the upper screen section; first adjustment means for adjusting the angle of inclination of the upper screen section; and second adjustment means for adjusting the angle of inclination of said lower screen section.
6. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, including pivot means for pivotally mounting the upper end of said upper screen section on said support frame, said first adjustment means comprising means for pivoting said upper screen section about said pivot means.
7. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 6, wherein said first adjustment means comprises adjustable mounting means for adjustably mounting the lower end of said upper screen section on said frame for movement in a direction transverse to the open front face of said liÏƒuid collection chamber. 


 8. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, wherein said second adjustment means comprises adjustable mounting means for adjustably mounting the lower end of said lower screen section on said frame for pivoting said lower screen section about said hinge means.
9. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein each of said adjustment means comprises an adjustable mounting means for adjustably mounting a portion of a respective one of said screen sections relative to said frame to move said portion in a direction towards and away from said collection chamber and adjust the angle of inclination of said respective screen section.
10. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 9, wherein each adjustable mounting mechanism comprises an adjustment shaft linked to said portion of a respective one of said screen sections at one end and projecting transversely from said screen section, and adjustable connecting means for adjustably connecting said shaft to said frame at a selected position along the length of the shaft.
11. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 10, wherein the adjustable connecting means comprises a mounting bracke. projecting inwardly from one of said side walls and having an opening through which said shaft projects, an adjustment nut threadably engaged on the projecting end of said shaft to move said shaft up and down through said opening, and locking means for locking said shaft in a selected position. 


 12. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the screen sections are separated by a gap between their adjacent ends, the screen assembly including a connector plate extending across the gap between the adjacent ends of said screen sections.
13. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein each screen section comprises an open rectangular cradle having spaced upper and lower walls and spaced side walls and an open base, at least two spaced cross braces extending between said side walls across the open base of said cradle, and a filter screen extending over said cross braces between the upper and lower ends of said screen.
14. The apparatus as claimed in Claim 13, wherein said first adjustment means comprises a pair of adjustable mounting mechanisms on opposite sides of said upper screen section adjustably connecting respective opposite portions of said side walls to the respective side walls of said frame, and said second adjustment means comprises a pair of adjustable mounting mechanisms on opposite sides of said lower screen section adjustably connecting respective opposite portions of said lower cradle side walls to the respective adjacent side walls of said frame.
