<ABSTRACT>
To uniformly develop a prestress, an extension device consists of an extension cable, which is fastened to one of the telescopic segments and runs out on a ladder extension winch on which a hydraulic extension motor (6) is arranged, and of a slack cable block (2) arranged upstream of the hydraulic extension motor (6). The winding drum is connected to a hydraulic bearer motor (9, 9') to which a hydraulic resistance (10, 10') is allocated. The hydraulic motors (6, 9, 9') and the hydraulic resistance (10, 10') can be operated separately from one another in a hydraulic system and can be activated separately, the hydraulic bearer motor (9, 9') running idle during operation of the hydraulic extension motor (6), and oil pressure being admitted to the hydraulic bearer motor (9, 9') after the ladder extension function is complete so that the bearer cable is tensioned during the unwinding and in the extended end position.
