<ABSTRACT>
A biodegradable laminated composite material based on hardened starch foam and a process for preparing the same are disclosed. During its preparation, the starch foam is bonded at the same time with a further layer of another material. The advantages of the invention lie in simple and economical production and in the versatility of use of the composite material.
