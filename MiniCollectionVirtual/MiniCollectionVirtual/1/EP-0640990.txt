<ABSTRACT>
A device is proposed for passively inerting the gas mixture generated in the containment of a nuclear power station in the event of an accident situation, which is based on employing chemical substances which, upon a particular reaction temperature being reached, react or decompose, releasing an inerting gas or gas mixture. The device is particularly suitable for use in conjunction with catalytic recombiners to remove hydrogen by oxidation with the oxygen present. The heat produced during this recombination, which proceeds exothermally, can be utilised to heat to the temperature required those chemical substances whose reaction temperature is above the temperature (approximately 100 DEG C) which will arise in the containment in the event of the accident situation.

release of hydrogen with a simultaneous increase in temperature, said device comprising means 
for the liberation of a gas for inerting the atmosphere in the reactor containment, characterized 

in that said means includes at least one inerting element (3; 14, 17) situated in the reactor 
containment and containing at least one chemical substance which delivers an inerting gas or 

gas mixture into the reactor containment through disintegration and/or chemical reaction when 
a certain temperature of reaction is exceeded. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the inerting gas comprises of 
CO₂ and/or steam. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized by at least one catalyst 
arrangement (2; 16) situated in the reactor containment for oxidation of the hydrogen, with at 

least one inerting element (3; 14, 17) disposed in the vicinity of the catalyst arrangement in 
such a manner that it will be heated up through thermal conduction, radiation and/or convection 

heat as caused by the catalyst arrangement's heating up because of catalytic reaction.

substances, the walls of the receptacle being permeable by gas and steam. 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in that the receptacle (4; 15, 18) is 
made from a wire grid made of stainless steel wire. 
Device according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that a filter layer (8) made of a 
HEPA filter material is located on the inside of the receptacle walls. 
Device according to one of the Claims 3 through 7, characterized in that the 
catalyst arrangement comprises a catalyst plate (2), to which one inerting element (3) or several 

inerting elements spaced apart from one another is/are connected so as to conduct heat well. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in that the inerting element or inerting 
elements (3) with the use of spacers (11) is/are attached to the catalyst plate at such a distance 

to the surface of the catalyst plate as to permit the free access of the surrounding atmosphere 
to the surface of the catalyst plate. 
Device according to one of the Claims 8 and 9, characterized in that the inerting 
element contains a plurality of chemical substances having different temperatures of reaction  

 
and arranged in layers, with the substance having the highest temperature of reaction placed 

nearest to the catalyst plate.

inerting material or inerting materials are used the remaining reaction product of which following 

disintegration or the reaction will remove oxygen from the gas mixture of the surrounding 
atmosphere through oxidation. 
Device according to one of the Claims 2 through 13, characterized in that such an 
inerting material or inerting materials are used the proportion of CO₂ and/or water of 

crystallization of which is at least 45 % of its/their molecular weight and preferably more.
