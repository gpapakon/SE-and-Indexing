<ABSTRACT>
A coupling disc (e.g., the armature or rotor) of 
an electromagnetic coupling such as a clutch or brake 

is formed with a plurality of concentric rows of 
specially shaped slots 31 which are filled with high 

magnetic reluctance brazing material 35 in order to 
structurally strengthen the disc and reduce the 

tendency of the disc to deflect and bend under high 
loads. Optionally, an annulus 50 (Fig. 6) of the 

brazing material may interconnect the rings 35b and may 
back and support the non-working face of the disc to 

further strengthen the disc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multiple pole coupling
discs of the type used in an electromagnetic coupling
such as an electromagnetic clutch or brake. The coupling
disc may be part of a rotary or non-rotary field or may
be a rotary or non-rotary armature.A typical electromagnetic coupling is disclosed in
Silvestrini et al United States Patent 4,187,939 and, in
that particular case, the coupling is an electromagnetic
clutch having a rotary armature disc made of material
having low magnetic reluctance such as steel and having a
field with a rotor which also is made of steel. When the
coil of the field is excited, magnetic flux threads a
path between the rotor and the axially opposing armature
and attracts the armature into engagement with the working
face of the rotor to couple the two for rotation in
unison. The working face of the rotor is defined by one
face of a disc which forms part of the rotor.The coupling disc of the present invention is particularly
useful in conjunction with a rotor which is
used, for example, in the clutch of a vehicular air conditioning
compressor. A pulley is attached to an outer
pole ring of the rotor and is driven by an endless belt.
When the clutch is engaged, the rotor is subjected to
relatively heavy belt loads (see for example GB-A-2 017 232).Rotors which are particularly useful with the
clutches of air conditioner compressors are disclosed in
detail in Booth et al United States Patent 4,685,202;
Roll et al United States Patent 4,891,077; Booth et al
United States Patent 4,891,619; Booth et al United States
Patent 4,951,797; Booth et al United States Patent
5,096,036 and Brown et al United States Patent 5,125,255.
The rotors disclosed in those patents have comparative
advantages and disadvantages but, in a general sense,
they share a common disadvantage. That is to say, such
rotors are generally not suitable for use when in the 
form of a relatively small diameter rotor which must be
capable of carrying heavy belt loads without failing
structurally, which must be comparatively light in
weight and which, at the same time, must possess
acceptable magnetic characteristics. For the most
part, the rotors disclosed in the above patents include
coupling discs formed with radially spaced rows of
angularly spaced "banana" slots which are separated by
relatively narrow webs or bridges. If the rotor disc
is of relatively small diameter and is then in an axial
direction, the webs eventually bend under heavy belt
loads and lead to structural failure of the rotor.The general aim of the
