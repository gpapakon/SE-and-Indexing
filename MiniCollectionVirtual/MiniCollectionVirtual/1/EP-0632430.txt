<ABSTRACT>
A DC feed-back circuit (A2) for causing a DC voltage of an 
external transistor (QX) in which an output bias current of a 

record amplifier flows to be equal to a DC voltage of an 
output terminal is provided so as to decrease power 

consumption. Thus, a plurality of record amplifying circuits 
can be incorporated into one IC chip. In particular, in home-use 

Hi-Fi VCRs, a Hi-Fi record amplifying circuit and video 
record amplifying circuits can be incorporated into one chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an amplifying circuit
for a magnetic record and playback apparatus, in particular,
to an amplifying circuit disposed on a rotary cylinder of a
magnetic record and playback apparatus.Fig. 10A and Fig. 10B show an example of an amplifying
circuit for a conventional magnetic recording apparatus. A
record amplifying circuit IC10a has an input terminal INa and
an output terminal OUTa. The output terminal OUTa of the
record amplifying circuit IC10a is connected to a primary
terminal of a rotary transformer RTa. Another primary side-terminal
of the rotary transformer RTa is connected to a power
supply Vcc. Secondary terminals of the rotary transformer RTa
are connected to magnetic head HDa.A record amplifying circuit IC10b has an input terminal
INb and an output terminal OUTb. The output terminal OUTb of
the record amplifying circuit IC10b is connected to a primary
terminal of a rotary transformer RTb. Another primary
terminal is connected to the power supply Vcc. Secondary
terminals of the rotary transformer RTb are connected to a 
magnetic head HDb.Circuits, including the record amplifying circuits IC10a
and IC10b, connected to the primary side of the rotary
transformers RTa and RTb are disposed on a circuit board of a
magnetic recording apparatus. On the other hand, circuits,
including the magnetic heads HDa and HDb, connected to the
secondary side of the rotary transformers RTa and RTb are
disposed on a rotary cylinder (not shown).The record amplifying circuits IC10a and IC10b are
employed for the most of magnetic recording apparatuses.
Although a DC current must not be supplied to the magnetic
heads, the rotary transformers prevent DC components from
being supplied, bias currents of ICs do not flow to the
magnetic heads. Thus, the degree of freedom of ICs becomes
large from a design point of view. In addition, since the
record amplifying circuit IC disposed on the circuit board and
the magnetic heads disposed on the rotary cylinder are
connected electrically, not mechanically, frictional noise due
to rotations of the rotary cylinder does not take place. In
other words, it can be said that this record amplifying
circuit properly operates.Since the description with respect to the record
amplifying circuit IC10a can apply to the record amplifying
circuit IC10b, only the record amplifying circuit IC10a will
be described. Assume that the primary inductance of the
rotary transformer RTa is L1; the secondary inductance of the
rotary transformer is L2; the coupling coefficient of
