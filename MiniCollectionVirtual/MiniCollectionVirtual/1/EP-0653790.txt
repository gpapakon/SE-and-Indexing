<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum-nickel-chromium (Al-Ni-Cr) layer (34) is used 
as an interconnect (31) within a semiconductor device. The Al-Ni-Cr 

layer (34) has about 0.1-0.5 weight percent nickel and about 
0.02-0.1 weight percent chromium. Usually, the nickel or 

chromium concentrations are no greater than 0.5 weight percent. 
The layer (34) is resistant to electromigration and corrosion. The 

low nickel and chromium concentrations allow the layer (34) to 
be deposited and patterned similar to most aluminum-based 

layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor 
devices, and in particular, to conductive layers for semiconductor 
devices. Aluminum is widely used for interconnects in 
semiconductor devices. However, aluminum has been found to be 
susceptible to a number of problems that may lead to device 
failure. Component densities (number of components per 
substrate area within an integrated circuit) typically are 
becoming higher as the size of components within a 
semiconductor device become smaller. The higher component 
density typically causes higher current densities in conductive 
layers when the device is operating. The higher current density 
generally results in an increase of device failure because of 
electromigration, which is a current-induced mass transport that 
is a function of current density and temperature of the device. 
Pure aluminum has problems with electromigration. In addition 
to electromigration, corrosion of the aluminum is a problem and 
is usually caused by chlorine exposure to the aluminum in an 
ambient including water, such as air exposure of an aluminum 
layer immediate following a dry etching step using chlorine-containing 
chemistry. In an attempt to solve the problems discussed above, an 
element, such as silicon (Si), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), or chromium 
(Cr) has been added to aluminum to form alloys. In reality, these 
alloys either do not solve all of the problems previously 
discussed or cause other problems. Electromigration is typically 
measured in terms of median-time-to-fail (MTTF) for a given 
current density and temperature. At a current density of about 
4x10⁶ amperes per square centimeter and a temperature of about 
175 degrees Celsius, the MTTF for Al-Cr is reported to be about  
 
830 hours and that of Al-Ni is reported to be only about 300 
hours. In addition, many aluminum alloys do not etch similar to 
aluminum and require aggressive processing conditions that may 
attack other portions of the semiconductor device, such as silicon 
dioxide. Therefore, new process steps may need to be developed. 
Also, when the concentrations of some of the elements in the 
aluminum alloy become too high, the resistance of the conductive 
layer may be too high.  The present invention includes a semiconductor device 
comprising a semiconductor substrate and a conductive layer 
overlying the substrate, wherein the conductive layer includes 
aluminum, nickel, and chromium. Other features and advantages of the present invention will 
be apparent from the
