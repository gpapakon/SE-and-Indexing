<ABSTRACT>
A method of chronic modification of cell barrier properties by exposing a cell to a modification-effective amount of IGF-I for at least about 7 days wherein the modification effective amount is between about 50  mu g/kg and less than about 500  mu g/kg is disclosed. Further disclosed is a method of chronic amelioration or reversal of insulin resistance as well as a method of diagnosing and screening for rhIGF-I sensitive cell barrier properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD FOR MODIFYING, DIAGNOSING AND SCREENING FOR IGF-ISENSITIVE CELL BARRIER PROPERTIES 
METHOD FOR MODIFYING, DIAGNOSING, AND SCREENING FOR IGF-I SENSITIVE CELL BARRIER PROPERTIESBACKGROUNDMany diseases have a secondary effect on cell barrier properties. For example, Diabetes ellitus can create a condition where a resistance to insulin exists or develops whereby the normal cell barrier mechanisms fail. In many such cases, adeguate amounts of insulin are available but the insulin is not able to perform its usual function. The explanations for this vary widely and, similarly, the therapeutic approaches to treating such conditions also vary widely. In cases of insulin resistance, several approaches are presently known in the art but no single approach has proven universally acceptable. Some approaches include diet and exercise, oral hypoglyce ic agents, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, fenfluramine, fatty acid oxidation inhibitors, atypical selective beta-adrenoceptor agonists, phenytoin sodium, captopril, an oxidized form of the trace element Vanadium (such as Vanadate) or a glucuretic agent (such as Phlorizin) and Insulin-like growth factors I and II. The summarization of the mode of administration and action of these various approaches which follows assists in the understanding of a complex yet not fully understood etiology of these diseases, in particular diseases manifesting insulin resistance, and more particularly, moderate to severe insulin resistance, also iatrogenic insulin resistance.Patients with insulin resistance are frequently afflicted with overt diabetes mellitus but may have normal tolerance to glucose. Indeed, a diverse array of clinical 

phenotypes have insulin resistance as a common element. As yet, there is no consensus molecular mechanism to explain the etiology of insulin resistance in the majority of these individuals. Among these various clinical syndromes, the degree of insulin resistance ranges from mild to severe. Essential hypertension is on the "mild" end of the insulin-resistance spectrum with insulin resistance increasing in severity from polycystic ovarian disease to the Type A syndrome to leprechaunism. The natural history of moderate to severe insulin resistance has not been studied in depth. The indications for treatment of hyperinsulinemia per se remain speculative. Moreover, there is no uniformly effective treatment for severe insulin resistance even in those patients with overt hyperglycemia. Indeed, over the last decade, investigators have learned more about the

3. The method of claim 1 wherein the modification effective amount is less than about 24 μg/kg/hr or less than about 288 μg/kg in a 12 hour period.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein the modification effective amount is about 100 μg/kg body weight twice daily.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein the modification-effective amount is administered to an animal in a mode selected from the group consisting of subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, orally, parenterally, enterally or topically.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein the modification is performed via in vivo treatment of mammals in need of such treatment.
