<ABSTRACT>
A sheet metal wire connecting device has a wire receiving 
slot (42) for receiving a wire (5) and being defined 

by opposed beams (34). The beams (34) have fixed ends (36,38) 
and tapered sections between the fixed ends (36,38) and intermediate 

sections (40) of the beams (34). The tapered 
sections are angularly inclined towards each other, such that 

when a wire (5) is inserted into the slot (42), the intermediates 
sections (40) of the beams (34) are plastically deformed, 

the remainder of the beams (34), remaining generally below the 
elastic limit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sheet metal electrical
connecting device of the type having a wire-receiving slot for
forming an electrical connection with a wire. There is described
and claimed in EP-A-0 404 450 from which the present
application has been divided, a connector assembly including a
stamped and formed sheet metal connecting device for commonly
connecting a plurality of wires, the device being of the type
having wire-receiving slots for the wires, the slots having
opposed edges which contact the wires upon movement of the
wires laterally of their axes and into the slots, the device
comprising two rows of U-shaped members, each U-shaped member
comprising a bight and first and second arms extending from
the bight, the U-shaped members of each row being in spaced-apart
aligned relationship, the first arms in each row being
coplanar and the second arms of each row being coplanar,
adjacent U-shaped members in each row having opposed edges
which define the wire-receiving slots, each row having first
and second connecting sections which extend for the length of
the row, the first and second arms of each U-shaped member
having ends which are integral with the associated first and
second connecting sections respectively, the first arms of
corresponding U-shaped members in the two rows being opposed
and proximate to each other,the second arms being remote from
each other and facing outwardly in opposite directions, the
two rows of U-shaped members being connected to each other by
a web which extends from one of the connecting sections of one
of the rows to the corresponding connecting section of the
other row, and a molded insulating housing body is provided
for covering the connecting device, the insulating housing
body having openings which are in registry with the wire-receiving
slots thereby to permit movement of the wires into
the slots. The present invention is intended to provide a sheet
metal electrical connecting device for forming an electrical
connection with a wire, which device is of relatively small
size but with which an extremely stable electrical connection
can be obtained.The present invention consists in a sheet metal connecting
device as defined in claim 1. Embodiments of the
present invention are defined in the subordinate claims.Embodiments of the present invention will now be
described, by way of example with reference to the accompanying
drawings in which:
Figure 1 is a perspective view, with the parts in
exploded aligned relationship, of an electrical connector
assembly;Figure 2
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A sheet metal connecting device for forming an electrical
connection with a wire (5), the device comprising a

plate-like member having a wire receiving slot (42), the slot
having a wire-receiving end (44), an inner end (46), and a

central portion, the slot being defined by opposed beams (34)
having fixed ends (36,38) proximate the wire-receiving end

(44) and the inner end (46) of the slot, the beams (34) being
configured with tapered sections between the fixed ends

(36,38) and the intermediate sections of the beams adjacent
the central portion of the slot (42), the tapered sections

being angularly inclined towards each other from the fixed
ends (36,38) to the intermediate sections (40), such that upon

insertion of a wire (5) into the slot, the intermediate sections
of the beams adjacent the central portion of the slot

are plastically deformed, with the stresses in the fixed ends
(36,38) of the beams (34) adjacent the wire-receiving end (44)

and the inner end (46) of the slot, and in said tapered sections
remaining generally below the elastic limit.
The sheet metal connecting device of claim 1, characterized
in that the plate-like member has a wire-receiving

end, the wire-receiving slot (42) extending into the wire-receiving
end, the wire-receiving end (44) of the slot (42)

and the inner end (46) being relatively wider than the central
portion.
The sheet metal connecting device of claim 2 characterized
in that the plate-like member has a pair of substantially oval

shaped openings (28) therein, one opening being provided on
each side of the wire-receiving slot (42), each opening having

a major axis which extends parallel to the slot (42) and a
minor axis which extends normally of the slot, portions of the

plate-like member which are between the openings (28) and the
slot (42) comprising the beams (34).
