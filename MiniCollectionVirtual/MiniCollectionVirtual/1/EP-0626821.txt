Intercardiac catheter (9) having the form of a hose (1) with electrodes (2) 
made as sensors, the sensors prestressed towards the outside and a fiber (4) 

running axially in the hose (1), a space (6) left between the hose (1) and the 
fiber (4) for supply of rinsing liquid, characterized by a foil (8) fixed to the 

hose (1) and the sensors (2) such that in the expanded state of the sensors (2) 
they make up a funnel open on top. 
Intercardiac catheter as claimed in 1, characterized by the sensors (2) fixed 
at the distal end of the hose (1). 
Intercardiac catheter as claimed in 1 or 2, characterized by electric leads (3) 
to the sensors (2) routed in the hose (1). 
Intercardiac catheter as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, characterized by a 
hose-shaped gap remaining between the inner wall of the hose (1) and the 

fiber (4). 
Intercardiac catheter as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, characterized by the 
fiber being an optical fiber.
