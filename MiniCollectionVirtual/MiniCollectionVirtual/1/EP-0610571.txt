A traversing device for a machine for simultaneously winding up a plurality of threads 
arriving parallel
 
with the following features: 


a) a plurality of traversing units are arranged in a row; 
b) each traversing unit comprises a first rotor and a second rotor; 
c) each rotor comprises a propeller-like arrangement of vanes and a toothed pulley 
connected thereto in a rotatably fixed manner; 
d) the vanes of the first rotors of all the traversing units are situated jointly in a first 
plane, and the vanes of the second rotors of all the traversing units in a second plane; 
e) the first rotor is coupled to the second rotor by a gear mechanism, so that it is rotatable 
in the opposite direction; 
f) a driving belt, which is toothed on both sides and which meshes with a driving 
pulley, embraces the toothed pulleys of the first rotors of adjacent traversing units in 

an alternate manner; 
characterized by
 further features: 

g) a respective roller (17), which comprises a first toothed rim (19) and a second 
toothed rim (20), is associated with each of the pairs of rotors (2,3) of the individual 

traversing units (
A, B, C, D, E, F
); 
h) the driving belt (25) embraces the toothed pulley (6) of the first rotor (2) and the 
first toothed rim (19) of the associated roller (17) in an alternate manner; 
i) a toothed belt (23) embraces the toothed pulley (16) of the second roller (3) and the 
second toothed rim (20) of the associated roller (17) in the manner of an open belt 

transmission. 
A traversing device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pairs of rotors (2,3) 
and the rollers (17) of the individual traversing units (
A
 .... 
D
) are arranged alternately 
along a straight line (24). 
A traversing device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pairs of rotors (2,3) 
of the individual traversing units (
A
 .... 
D
) are arranged along a straight line (24) and the  
 

associated rollers (17) are arranged alternately with respect to the two sides of the line 
(24). 
A traversing device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pairs of rotors (2, 3) 
of the individual traversing units (
A
 .... 
F
) are arranged along a straight line (24) and the 
associated rollers (17) are arranged along another parallel straight line (33), and the 

driving belt (25) is guided between the toothed rim (19) of one traversing (
A
 .... 
E
) 
and the toothed pulley (6) of the adjacent traversing unit (
B
 .... 
F
) by way of additional 
guiding pulleys (34, 35).
