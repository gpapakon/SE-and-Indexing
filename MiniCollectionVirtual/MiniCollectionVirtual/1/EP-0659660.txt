<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for 
the handling of paper rolls. The paper 

rolls are stored in a horizontal position 
in two tiers in such manner that a 

top-tier roll (3b) lies partly above a 
bottom-tier roll (3a) and the bottom-tier 

roll can be hoisted up from its place 
without moving the rolls in the upper 

tier. The hoisting movement is substantially 
curvilinear. The paper rolls are 

arranged in two tiers in such manner 
that, in the longitudinal direction of a 

row of paper rolls, there are at least 
two storing places for a bottom-tier roll 

(3a) between each two storing places for 
a top-tier roll (3b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a procedure for the handling 
of paper rolls as defined in the preamble of claim 1. Traditionally, paper rolls are stored either in a horizontal 
or a vertical position. Storing the rolls in a vertical 
position allows several rolls to be placed on top of each 
other, but the problem is generally that the bottommost 
rolls cannot be extracted from under the top rolls. If the 
roll needed at a given time happens to be the bottommost 
one, the rolls on top of it have to be removed first. This 
again requires free space and retards the process. In any 
case, paper rolls provided with a spindle cannot be stored 
in a vertical position. In the case of horizontal storage, paper rolls can traditionally 
only be placed in one tier. This requires plenty of 
space and is therefore an expensive storage method. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the 
drawbacks mentioned above and to achieve a reliable, advantageous 
and space-saving procedure for the handling of paper 
rolls during storage and translocation. The procedure of the 
invention is characterized by what is presented in 
claim 1. The invention also relates to 
an apparatus as defined in the preamble of claim 3. The apparatus 
is characterized by what is presented in the characterization 
part of claim 3. Other embodiments of the invention 
are characterized by the features presented in the 
other claims. The solution of the invention provides the advantage of a 
low space requirement and a high storage capacity. The 
capacity is increased by approximately one third as compared 
with previously known technology. A further advantage is 
that all paper rolls can be handled without removing other 
rolls to make way for those to be handled.  
 In the following, the invention is described in detail by 
the aid of an application example by referring to the 
attached drawings, in which 
Fig. 1.presents a crane and a paper roll storage in side 
view, Fig. 2.presents a crane and a paper roll storage in top 
view, and Fig. 3presents a load device and a two-tier row of paper 
rolls as seen from one end of the storage area. The procedure of the invention for the handling of paper 
rolls 3 is based on the relative positions of the storing 
places with respect to each other and on the synchronization 
of the hoisting and traversing movements of the crane 1. The 
paper rolls 3 are stored by placing several rolls in succession 
and side by side in the storage 2. Hereinafter, 'paper 
rolls placed in succession' means rolls

<CLAIMS>
Procedure for the handling of paper rolls, in which 
procedure the stored paper rolls are kept in a horizontal 

position on supports (4,5) in a storage (2), 
characterized
 
in that the paper rolls are stored in two tiers in such manner 

that a top-tier roll (3b) lies partly above a bottom-tier 
roll (3a) and that, when a bottom-tier roll is being 

moved into or out of its place, besides being moved in a 
vertical direction, it is also moved in a horizontal direction 

below the top-tier roll. 
Procedure according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the 
paper rolls are so arranged in the storage that, when a bottom-tier 

roll (3a) is being hoisted, the hoisting movement 
is performed along a substantially curvilinear path in such 

manner that the hoisting movement first occurs in a direction 
mainly straight up, then obliquely sideways and upwards 

and finally directly upwards. 
Apparatus for the handling of paper rolls, which apparatus 
consists of a crane (1) comprising a hoisting machinery 

(7) and a load device (8) provided with hoisting elements 
such as hooks (9) and of a storage space (2) for paper rolls 

(3) stored in a horizontal position, 
characterized
 in that 
the paper rolls are arranged in the storage in two tiers 

such that, except for the extreme ends of the rows, each 
top-tier roll (3b) is preceded and followed in the lengthwise 

direction of the row of rolls by at least one bottom-tier 
roll (3a). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterized
 in that the 
paper rolls are arranged in the storage in two tiers such 

that between each two storing places for a top-tier roll 
(3b) there are at least two storing places for a bottom-tier 

roll (3a).  
 
Apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the 
storing places for bottom-tier rolls (3a) consist of supports 

(4) arranged at equal distances from each other, and 
that the storing places for top-tier ross (3b) consist of 

supports (5) arranged at equal distances from each other, 
this distance being twice as long as the distance between 

the supports (4) for bottom-tier rolls.
