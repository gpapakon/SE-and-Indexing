<ABSTRACT>
Methods for controlling the formation of 
proteinaceous fouling deposits in high temperature 

evaporators and concentrators as employed e.g. in 
processing steepwater in the wet milling of corn. The 

methods comprise adding lecithin, or a long chain 
fatty acid to the steepwater in effective inhibiting 

amounts, e.g. an amount ranging from about 150 parts 
per million to about 500 parts per million steepwater.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to methods for controlling 
organic deposition on heat transfer surfaces. Lecithin and 
long-chained fatty acids are employed to control organic deposition 
in high temperature evaporators which are employed for 
concentrating steepwater in the wet milling of corn. During the wet milling of corn, fouling of the equipment by 
protein-containing fluids can occur. The wet milling processing of 
shelled corn is employed to obtain staple products such as corn 
oil, dextrose, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, dextrins, dry 
starches and feeds. The principle steps in the wet milling of corn 
include steeping, milling, recovering and processing. During the 
steeping process, corn kernels are softened by soaking in a hot, 
dilute solution of sulfurous acid (i.e., water/sulfur dioxide).  
 
The softened kernels are then passed through grinding mills and 
separators where the germ is removed and the starch and gluten are 
separated from the coarser hull and fibers. The starch is then 
separated from the gluten which is added to the fibrous material 
and processed into a high protein animal feed. The starch is 
recovered as dry starch or further processed into dextrose and 
fructose. The sulfurous acid steepwater initially used to soften 
the corn contains solubles which are recovered for use in feeds. 
The steepwater solids are recovered by evaporation and drying. The 
solids recovered from evaporating and drying the steepwater are 
used as additives to livestock feeds to enhance their nutritional 
value. The deposition of organic, proteinaceous materials in the 
steepwater evaporators limits throughput and is a bottle-neck in 
the wet milling corn process. To cope with such organic deposition 
fouling, such evaporators are typically boiled out with an acid 
and/or caustic solution. Such boil-out procedures result in 
undesirable downtime for the equipment. The present invention is 
directed to a process for controlling deposition in such 
evaporators so as to minimize the requirement for such boil-out 
procedures.  The present invention provides for methods for inhibiting 
the deposition of organic matter on heat transfer surfaces. The 
methods provide for employing lecithin or a long chain fatty acid 
to inhibit the deposition of organic, proteinaceous matter on the 
surfaces of evaporators and concentrators. U.S. Patent 3,362,829 discloses a process for coating 
powdered vital wheat gluten with a nonionic hydrophilic lipid 
selected from the class consisting of
