<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary operating device for a circuit breaker. The device includes a rotary handle (15) mounted on a casing (14) containing a mechanism for coupling between a pivoting crankpin of the circuit breaker and the said handle. This handle is integral with a semicircular drive groove (17) which carries an eccentric pin (18) acting on a drive fork (20) which pivots about a fixed shaft (21). This fork is equipped with an opening (22) in order to house the said crankpin and with an indexing plate (31'). A pivoting bar (33) constitutes, with the opening (22) and the indexing plate (31') an indexing system preventing the rotary operating device being put in place when there is inconsistency between the state of the crankpin and that of the handle.

A rotary control device (13, 110) for a circuit breaker (10), notably a three-phase
circuit breaker of the industrial type, which comprises a front closing plate provided

with an opening through which there passes a pivoting crank pin (30) able to occupy
at least two stable extreme positions, said device comprising a housing (14, 113)

mounted on said front plate, a rotary handle (15, 112) securedly united to this
housing, and a mechanism to couple said handle (15, 112) and said crank pin (30),

characterized in that said coupling mechanism comprises error prevention means
arranged to prevent fitting of said rotary control device (13, 110) when its state is in

disagreement with that of the circuit breaker (10).
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that said coupling mechanism
comprises a driving head (17) movable in rotation with said rotary handle (15) and a

driving fork (20) pivoting around a fixed spindle (21) and mechanically coupled to said
driving head by an eccentric pin (18) borne by the latter and engaged in an oblong

housing (19) arranged in said driving fork, and that said error prevention means
comprise an opening (22) arranged in said driving fork in which said crank pin of the

circuit breaker is engaged when the circuit breaker and the rotary control device are
in agreement of state, and a plate securedly affixed to said fork and bordering said

opening at least partially.
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that said driving fork (20)
comprises a first part (20a) and a second part (20b) arranged in parallel and

securedly attached to one another, that said oblong housing (19) is arranged in said
first part (20a) and said opening (22) is arranged in said second part (20b).
The device according to claim 2, characterized in that said error prevention means
comprise in addition a strip (33) pivoting between a spindle (34) and joined by one of

its ends to said driving fork (20).
The device according to claim 4, characterized in that said plate is located on one
side of the opening (22) and that said strip (33), located on the other side of the

opening (22), comprises at one of its ends a pin (35) engaged in an oblong opening
(36) of said second part (20b) of the driving fork (20). 
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises door locking
means associated to said coupling mechanism, said locking means comprising a

pivoting latch (40) biased by a spring (46) and provided with a stop (44) arranged to
cooperate with a hook (45) securedly affixed to an enclosure containing the circuit

breaker and a nose (42) arranged to cooperate with a stop (43) securedly affixed to
the driving head (17).
The device according to claim 6, characterized in that said latch (40) is provided
with at least one first removable screw (47) arranged to cooperate with a first fixed

stop (49) securedly affixed to the housing (14) to prevent cooperation of the nose (42)
and of the stop (43) securedly affixed to the driving head, and with at least one

second removable screw (48) arranged to cooperate with a second fixed stop (50)
securedly affixed to the housing (14) to prevent cooperation of the stop (44) with the

hook (45) securedly affixed to the enclosure containing the circuit breaker.
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a keylock (60,
60') with barrel for locking the driving fork (20).
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises in addition:

an operating spindle (111) fitted between the handle (112) and the case (113),
a flexible device (114) for recentring the operating spindle (111) having a sleeve
(121) performing mechanical coupling between the operating spindle (111) and a

driving head (119) of the case (113), said sleeve (121) comprising a first appreciably
cylindrical section (122), housed with clearance in a frustum-shaped central recess

(120) of the driving head (119),
a first cog-wheel (133) of the first section (122) being arranged to cooperate with a
second conjugate cog-wheel of said driving head.
The control device according to claim 9, characterized in that said sleeve (121)
comprises a second appreciably cylindrical section (123) comprising a recess of

polygonal cross-section, arranged to receive one end of the operating spindle (111),
said sleeve (121) and the driving head (119) being held in their relative axial positions

by a screw (124), that a compression spring (129) is fitted between one edge (130) of 
the sleeve (121) and a bearing ring (131) coaxial to the driving head (119) and

bearing against the latter, and that a protective shell (132) masks said compression
spring (129).
