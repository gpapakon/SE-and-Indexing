<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic 
recording/reproducing apparatus, for instance, video tape 
recorder (VTR) and, more particularly, to a chassis of 
magnetic recording/reproducing apparatus, which is used for 
mounting a cassette loading system, tape loading system, tape 
driving system, for example, and its manufacturing method. In general, in this type of chassis, a pair of 
reel shafts 2a, 2b on which reel hubs of a tape cassette are 
mounted are vertically installed at specific positions on a 
metal plate 1 as illustrated in FIGURE 1. Corresponding to 
these reel shafts 2a, 2b, there are mounted a plurality of 
mounting base members 3 comprising a tape loading system to 
pull out a tape and load it on a rotary cylinder with a 
rotating head mounted, a tape driving system including a tape 
guide mechanism to guide a loaded magnetic tape when 
traveling, and a mode control system. Therefore, in 
such a chassis, accuracies of the tape loading system, the 
tape driving system and the mode control system are 
decided depending upon the installing accuracy of the 
mounting base members 3 and their installing accuracy largely 
affects the manufacturing of magnetic recording/reproducing 
apparatus such as VTRs, and the like. So, such chassis mounting base members 3, e.g., such  
 
parts 3b as a brake member mounting hook of the tape driving 
system, a support of the mode control system, etc. for which 
relatively low strength and accuracy are demanded are molded 
in an outsert manner and installed using thermoplastics, 
e.g., polyoxymethylene (POM), etc., while such parts 3b as a 
cylinder mount for fixing a rotary cylinder, a tape guide 
post for controlling a magnetic tape with high accuracy 
against the rotary cylinder, the reel shafts 2a, 2b, etc. for 
which a high strength and a high accuracy are demanded are 
manufactured by, for instance, machining metallic materials, 
and then mounted on the metal plate 1 using fasteners such as 
screws 4, a caulking operation, and the like. However, this chassis has problems in that the number 
of parts comprising the tape loading system and the tape 
driving system increases greatly; the control of parts is 
extremely troublesome; many processes are required; the 
manufacturing operation including the assembling operation is 
extremely troublesome. Furthermore, as relatively many 
metallic materials are used and fastening operations using 
screws and caulking operations are needed, the weight will 
increase and at the same time, it becomes difficult to 
pr
