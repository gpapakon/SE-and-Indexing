<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns an electrically conducting liquid-crystal polymer, process for its preparation and fibers and films comprised at least to some extent of said polymer. According to the invention, the liquid-crystal polymer comprises a main chain incorporating conjugated double bonds, the monomer units of said main chain being linked to side chains which, together with the main chain, render the polymer liquid-crystal properties at elevated temperatures. The main chain is treated with an electron-donor or corresponding electron-acceptor type of dopant to make it conducting. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the conducting liquid-crystal polymer is prepared by polymerizing 3-dodecylthiophene monomers, after which the polymer obtained in this manner is doped using ferric chloride or iodine. The polymer can be processed into fibers or films using conventional processing methods of plastics such as die extrusion, injection molding, ram molding or film blowing.

<DESCRIPTION>
ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTING LIQUID-CRYSTAL POLYMERS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOFThe present invention relates to polymers possessing both liquid-crystal and conducting properties. The invention also concerns a method for the production of electrically conducting liquid-crystal polymers and fibers and films incorporating these polymers.Electrically conducting polymers are subjected to intensive research around the world. They can be prepared from organic polymers having long conjugated chains of double bonds. The ^-electrons of the double bonds are disturbed by doping the polymer with certain dopants which may be electron acceptors or donators. Then, the doping produces vacancies or alternatively excess electrons in the polymer chain that facilitate current flow along the conjugated chain. The electrical conductivity of the polymer can be controlled by varying the dopant concentration so as to cover nearly the entire spectrum of conductivity from insulators to metals.The above-mentioned polymers are suited to several interesting fields of application. For instance, they can be utilized to replace metallic conductors and semiconductors in multiple applications such as batteries, photo-electric components, printed-circuit boards, antistatic packaging and electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression materials.In comparison with metals, the potential advantages of electrically conducting polymers are their light weight, mechanical properties, stability in corrosive environments and lower costs in synthetic preparation and processing. It must be noted, however, that the processing and stability properties of most intrinsically electrically conducting polymers do not today permit their use in the above-described applications.Polymers that can be modified electrically conducting by doping include poly- acetylene, poly-para-phenylene, polypyrrole, polythiophene and polyaniline. 

Liquid-crystal polymers are also being investigated widely. Their spinning and tenacity characteristics in the liquid-crystal state offer optimal prerequisites for the processing of fibers with high mechanical performance. The orientation of polymer chains in the liquid-crystal state under the influence of an electrical or magnetic field also provides a possibility of using said polymers in the optical systems of display terminals and other applications utilizing optical effects.The actual liquid crystal in liquid-crystal polymers is formed by a rigid structural unit called a mesogen. Mesogens are generally formed by two or more
