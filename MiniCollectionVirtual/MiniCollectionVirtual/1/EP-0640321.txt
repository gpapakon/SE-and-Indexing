<ABSTRACT>
There is presented a dental handpiece which comprises a coupling body (8) in which there is arranged a conduction channel (13) for the supply of a liquid coolant to an outlet nozzle (6) on the top part (3) of the handpiece. The conduction channel (13, 17) comprises a radial recess (14) which penetrates the jacket surface of the coupling body (8) and in which there is a check valve (15). The check valve comprises, on the one hand, a movable section (15a) which acts as a sealing body and blocks the conduction channel (17) or unblocks it as a function of the liquid pressure and, on the other hand, a section (15c) which is immovable relative to the section (15a) and which seals the recess (14) towards the jacket surface of the coupling body (8). The check valve prevents liquid contaminated with microorganisms from flowing back.

Dental handpiece, which comprises a coupling
body (8), in which there is arranged a duct (12, 13)

for the supply of a cooling fluid to an outlet nozzle
(6) on the head portion (3) of the handpiece, with

there being arranged in the duct a non-return valve
(15), which comprises on the one hand a movable section

(15a), which acts as a closing body and closes or
releases the mouth opening (17) of the duct (12) as a

function of the hydrostatic pressure, and comprises on
the other hand a section (15c), which is not movable

with respect thereto and seals the duct with respect to
the outside, and with the non-movable section (15c),

which seals a recess (14) with respect to the lateral

surface of the coupling body (8), the movable section
(15a) and the recess (14) delimiting a chamber (19),

characterised in that the duct (12, 13) comprises a
radial recess (14), which penetrates the lateral

surface of the coupling body (8) and in which the non-return
valve (15) is arranged, and in that the movable

section (15a) of the non-return valve (5 (sic)) is
shaped in such a way, and its elasticity is selected in

such a way, that, immediately after the fluid supply
has been switched off, in the state of a suck-back in

the duct (12), said section rests with a larger sealing
surface against the delimiting surface (18) of the

mouth opening (17) than in the unloaded closed state,
as a result of which an increase in the volume of the

chamber (19) is effected and a small defined suck-back
effect ensues in the duct (13) which leads to the

outlet nozzle.
Dental handpiece according to claim 1, in
which the section (15a) which forms the closing body is

constructed so as to be plate-like and at least this
section consists of an elastic material, with shape and

elasticity being selected in such a way that in the 
unloaded state, only the plate edge of the section

rests against a delimiting surface (18) of the coupling
body (8), which surface (18) delimits the mouth opening

of the supply duct (17), while on the other hand, after
the fluid supply has been switched off, a very much

larger area of the closing body section rests against
the delimiting surface (18).
Dental handpiece according to claim 2, in
which the plate-like section (15a) is connected by a

centre web (15b) to the non-movable section (15c) and
the latter has a sealing element (15d), which is

preferably pre-formed, for sealing the chamber with
respect to the peripheral opening of the recess.
Dental handpiece according to claim 3, in
which the non-return valve consists of a one-piece

moulded part.
Dental handpiece according to one of claims 1
to 4, in which there is provided in the recess (14) an

adjusting element (16) for adjusting the initial
stressing force of the closing body (15a) of the non-return

valve (15).
Dental handpiece according to one of claims
to 5, in which the recess (14) of the coupling body (8)

is peripherally delimited by the outer sleeve (7) of
the handpiece.
