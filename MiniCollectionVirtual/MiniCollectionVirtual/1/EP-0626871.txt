<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a method and apparatus for the controlled non-pyrolytic reduction of organic material comprising subjecting the material to microwave radiation in a reducing atmosphere. An apparatus for carrying out the method comprises a microwave chamber (40) or modules of chambers, at least one microwave generator (32), an antenna (34) connected to each said generator and a reflecting surface (36). Means are provided for feeding (48) the organic material into the chamber (40), removing (18) gaseous products and solid residue (22) from the chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to a method and 
apparatus for the reduction of organic materials using 
microwave radiation. There are numerous instances in diverse areas 
where it is desirable that organic materials be reduced. 
Such a requirement may arise in the processing of raw 
materials, as, for example, in the extraction of oil from 
oil shales, or in the treatment of waste materials. The waste treatment category will arise in an 
endless number of situations. This may be due to the 
useful life of the product having been completed. For 
example, huge quantities of worn out tires are in 
existence. The waste may also arise from normal industrial 
processes. Refinery sludge and pulp mill effluents are 
examples. Municipal sewage and garbage are other sources 
of large quantities of organic waste. Various considerations dependent on the 
particular waste type mandate that the waste be treated. 
In the case of municipal sewage, for example, the waste is 
a health and environmental hazard and its toxicity must be 
neutralized. In the case of tires the emphasis is on 
recycling of the very substantial amounts particularly of 
oil and carbon black which are the major components of 
tires.  
 The treatment of various of these waste types as, 
for example, by burning, may itself lead to environmental 
pollution problems. There is therefore an ongoing need for more 
efficient treatment and recycling methods for organic 
materials. Against this background the present invention is 
directed toward the use of microwave energy in a method and 
apparatus which is applicable in a very general sense to a 
very wide range of organic materials. Applicant is unaware of any prior use of microwave 
energy in the treatment of organic materials for 
non-pyrolytic reduction purposes. WO-A-9103281 discloses 
the use of microwaves in the controlled reduction of 
organic materials. Canadian Patent No. 1,158,432, issued 
December 13, 1983, to Tillitt, suggests the use of microwave 
energy in drying bulk materials such as grains. 
The patent offers no aid to the reduction problem discussed 
above. U.S. Patent 4,123,230, granted October 31, 1978, 
to Kirkbride, suggests the use of multiple wave sources, 
but these are used to provide microwaves of different 
frequencies. There is no suggestion of focusing nor of 
creating a uniform or preferred distribution pattern. U.S. Patent 4,184,614, granted April 10, 1979, 
also to Kirkbride, describes a somewhat different process 
than that set out in the preceding reference but contains 
th

A method for the controlled non-pyrolytic 
reduction of organic material comprising: 


continuously feeding said material into a 
microwave chamber; 
generating microwave energy in said chamber 
by means of an array of microwave generators; 
transmitting microwave energy in a reducing 
atmosphere from said generators by means of antennae 

to corresponding microwave reflectors; 
focusing said microwave energy from each said 
reflector in a predetermined pattern; and arranging said 

reflectors such that said predetermined patterns overlap to 
provide an area of substantially uniform microwave 

application across said chamber;

said material to microwave energy; and 
continuously removing gaseous products and solid 
residue from said chamber.

predetermined pattern is substantially circular. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising feeding 
said material through a series of said chambers 

interconnected in modular configuration. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising 
adjusting said pattern by adjusting the position of

an antenna (34) associated with each said 
generator (16, 32) for transmitting microwaves from said 

generator (16, 32); 
a reflector (36) associated with each said 
antenna (34) for receiving microwaves from said 

antenna (34) and focusing said microwaves in a
