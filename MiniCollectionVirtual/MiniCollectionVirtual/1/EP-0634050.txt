TEMPERATURE OPERATED SWITCH CONSTRUCTION AND METHODOF MAKING THE SAME Technical FieldThis invention relates to a new temperature operated switch construction and to a new method of making such a temperature operated switch construction. Background ArtIt is known to provide a temperature operated switch construction comprising a housing means, a movable switch arm carried in the housing means, temperature actuated means disposed in the housing means and being operatively interconnected to the switch arm to cause movement of the switch arm between operating positions thereof in relation to the temperature being sensed by the temperature actuated means, the housing means comprising a main part and a removable terminal block carried by the main part, the terminal block carrying a switch means that is operatively associated with the switch arm so that the switch means is in a first condition thereof when the switch arm is in a first operating position thereof and the switch means is in a second condition thereof when the switch arm is in a second operating position thereof. For example, see FIGS. 1 and 2 of this application.It is also known to form the switch means of said prior known switch construction as set forth above to comprise a reed switch means, with the switch arm carrying a magnet for operating the reed switch means to the conditions thereof as the switch arm is moved to the positions thereof. For example see the U. S. patent to Thomas M. Buckshaw et al, No. 5,148,142. It is also known to operate a reed switch 

means through the movement of a switch arm that carries a magnet means. For example, see FIGS. 4 and 5 of this application.It is also known to move such switch arm for influencing the operating condition of a reed switch means by temperature actuated means. For example, see the U. S. patent to Teichert et al. No. 4,246,457. Disclosure of the Invention It is a feature of this invention to provide a new temperature operated switch construction wherein a reed switch means is utilized therein in a unique manner.In particular, it has been found according to the teachings of this invention that a certain temperature operated switch construction or thermostat that normally has a switch arm moved by temperature actuated means so as to place contact means of that switch arm into electrical contact with, or out of electrical contact from, contact means carried by a terminal block of the switch construction is subject to the adverse effects of abnormal environments, such as elevated temperatures,

5. A switch construction as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that said switch arm (30A) has a pair of opposed tubular sections (103, 104) extending from opposed sides (105, 106) thereof and respectively receiving first parts (100, 102) of said springs (97, 98) therein so that second parts (99, 101) of said springs respectively extend beyond said tubular sections (103, 104).
6. A switch construction as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that said housing means (21A) has spaced apart stop means (54, 55) that are respectively engaged by said switch arm (30A) and thereby determine said positions thereof.
7. A switch construction as set forth in claim 6, characterized in that said housing means (21A) has a cavity (53) therein that defines said spaced apart stop means (54, 55).
8. A switch construction as set forth in claim 7, characterized in that said switch arm (30A) has an outer end (31A) provided with a projection (56) thereon that extends into said cavity (53) for respectively engaging against said spaced apart stop means (54, 55). 


 9. A switch construction as set forth in claim 8, characterized in that said switch arm (30A) has a longitudinal axis and in that said switch arm (30A) carries said magnet means (65) in an offset relation to said longitudinal axis thereof.
