<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical
composition for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).Ever since AIDS was first reported in the U.S. in
1981, the number of persons afflicted with this disease has
risen rapidly, with recent reports indicating that the number
has grown to 300,000 with an additional 1.2 million carriers
in the U.S. alone. At present, although the virus has been
identified and aggressive efforts are being made to develop
effective methods of treatment and prevention of AIDS
throughout the world, a suitable means of treatment and
prevention has yet to be discovered as of 1993. Moreover,
the spread of this disease is much faster than what was
originally expected, with current estimates indicating that
the number of persons suffering from this disease will reach
more than 40 million on a global scale at the end of this
century. Thus, development of a means of prevention and
discovery of an effective treatment method are being hoped
for as quickly as possible. Although the development of a
vaccine would be the most desirable, there are currently no
vaccines being developed considered to be effective, and the
time schedule for their completion remains undetermined.
Moreover, the number of therapeutic drugs, such as AZT
(amidothymidine) and DDI, are extremely few, the completion
of an effective therapeutic drug appears to be a long way
off, and there are serious adverse side effects, including
bone marrow function disorders and liver function disorders,
that make adequate continuous therapy essentially impossible.
DDI (dideoxyinosine) and DDC (dideoxycytidine) and other
drugs that have recently come into widespread use have
effects similar to those of AZT, and there are have been no 
reports of these drugs resulting in successful treatment
anywhere in the world thus far. Moreover, since patients are
dying within only several years after onset of the disease
and the mortality rate is 100%, AIDS is considered to be one
of the most threatening diseases to face mankind in recorded
history.The disease mechanism of AIDS first begins with
invasion of viruses to CD4 lymphocytes, which serve as the
basis of the immune system, the basic defense mechanism of
the human body. These lymphocytes are successively destroyed
resulting in acquired immunodeficiency. Ultimately, the
disease invariably results in death caused by serious
infection, malignant tumors such as Kaposi's sarcoma, and
direct damage of the nervous system by the virus. The stages
from infection to death can be
