<ABSTRACT>
A double lock device (1) having latching arms (2) and 
through holes (12) located in the vicinity of the ends of 

the latching arms (2) is placed in a connector housing (50). 
In a normal state, the lugs (10) of the latching arms (2) are 

locked in depressions (58) of the housing (50). In order to 
release this locking, the latching arms (2) are bent by a 

tool (80) whose tip (82) becomes engaged with the through hole 
(12). The double lock device (1) is extracted by moving the 

tool (80) in the direction shown by arrow B.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to double-lock connectors,
especially to double-lock connectors having a double-lock
device with a latching arm.Contacts arrayed inside connectors are usually placed
into the contact cavity by means of a housing lance or
some other device. Double lock devices are generally used
in order to increase the retaining force holding these
contacts inside the housing. A number of methods for
latching in double lock devices has been offered ranging
from a simple fitting of a protrusion in a notch to
devices incorporating springy elements, such as,
described in the Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 1992-23440.For example, Fig. 5 of the accompanying drawings represents a cross section of a
conventional connector in which a double lock device with
a latching arm is used. This connector 100 consists of a
housing 102, a double lock 130 and a cover 120. Contacts
and the cavity in which the contacts are retained are not
shown in the drawing. The double lock device 130 is of
approximately rectangular shape and, in the drawing, it is
shown in the state when it is completely locked in the
housing 102. At approximately midpoint of the double lock
device 130, there are two latching arms 132 and 142
extending in opposite directions. In the vicinity of the
free ends of the latching arms 132 and 142, lugs 134 and
144 respectively are provided. The double lock device 130
is inserted in the cavity 106 of the housing 102 from the
side surface 104 of the housing 102. First, the lug 144
becomes engaged with a lug 108 of the housing 102, thus
providing a state of temporary latching of the double lock
device 130. Next, when the double lock device 130 is
inserted even farther in, the lug 134 of the latching arm
132 becomes engaged with a lug 110 of the housing 102,
thus completing the latching. Due to this complete
latching, the contacts are prevented from being pulled out 
in the direction of their axes.Rarely, but in some cases, because of a damaged
contact or improper wiring, it is necessary to remove the
double lock device after it has been inserted. In such
cases, the latching between lugs 124 and 110 is released by
bending the latching arm 132 in the direction shown by the
arrow A by pushing its end by a tip of a screw driver or
some other tool. However, this design has the disadvantage
that the latching condition between the latching arm 132 and
the lug 110 can easily resume, thus making the task of
removal of the double lock device 130 rather difficult.The aim of the present invention is to provide
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A double lock connector having a housing (50) with a
cavity (56) for receiving a double lock device (1) which

serves to lock electrical contacts of the connector in
passageways in t
he housing and which has latching arms
(2,2') for retaining the device (1) in the cavity (56),

characterized in that the double lock device (1) has a tool
receiving area (12,12') proximate the latching arm (2,2')

such that the latching arms (2,2') can be unlatched from the
housing (50) using a tool (80), whereupon the double lock

device (1) is removable from the cavity (56) using the tool
(80) in cooperation with said tool receiving area (12,12')

and while the latching arms (2,2') are held in the unlatched
position by the tool (80).
The connector of claim 1, wherein the double lock
device (1) has openings (4) to allow for insertion of the

electrical contacts.
The connector of claim 1 or 2, wherein the latching
arms (2,2') have lugs (10).
The connector of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the tool
receiving area (12,12') is a through hole.
The connector of claim 4, wherein the through hole
(12,12') has a bottom wall (14') which is approximately at

a middle point of the latching arm (2,2').
The connector of claim 5, wherein the latching arm
(2,2') can be bent inside the through hole (12') and said

tool (80) is engageable with an upper wall (13') of the
through hole (12').
