<ABSTRACT>
A method and system (10) for generating a reconfigurable terrain and culture database of a simulated environment. Terrain and culture data are extracted from at least one of a plurality of digital data sources (14), and the extracted data is transformed into a predetermined central database format (22) from which the extracted data may be edited (24) and formatted (28) for a particular imaging system. The terrain and culture data are not merged until formatting in order to enable rapid reskinning of the terrain or the addition of further culture details.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
training and mission simulation systems, and
particularly to a method and system for generating a
reconfigurable terrain and culture data base of a
simulated environment.Flight simulation has proved to be an effective
method for crew and mission training. An integral
component of flight simulation is the out-of-the-window
visual scene. The creation of such a visual database
typically begins with real-world source data that has
been derived from satellite imagery, U.S. Geological
Survey information or a mapping agency. However, in
order to comply with visual system requirements,
changes to this data is generally made during database
production. In this regard, it should be appreciated
that the training crew needs to be presented with as
many different situations as possible, and these
situations may be introduced through a non-real-world
or customized visual database which is tailor made for
the desired training exercise or through a close
approximate to the real-world. Accordingly, it is
often necessary to add features to the visual database
that do not appear in the real-world area being 
simulated or modify existing features.While a specific simulation system may be very
effective for a particular training application, it
should also be appreciated that there are many diverse
situations where a simulation system would be
desirable. However, if the simulation system has to be
redesigned for each new project or set of training
exercises, then substantial costs will result and
valuable time will be lost. Nevertheless, in order to
maximize the training benefit, an accurate
representation of a particular visual database is
necessary. Accordingly, there is a need for a
technique for producing visual databases that not only
provide an exact depiction of the input data, but a
technique which will also enable the simulation system
to be configured for a variety of training
applications.In WO 90/14627 is described a method for
generating a composite map from a plurality of
databases, wherein any errors in the databases are
corrected. After having inputted the coordinate data
of each database into a computer, a map corresponding
to each database is generated and the generated maps
are compared. Then, any errors in the databases
revealed by the comparison are corrected and a
composite map is generated from a composite database
of all the corrected data.The present invention provides a method and
system for generating a terrain and cultural data base
for a simulated

<CLAIMS>
A method for generating a reconfigurable terrain
and culture database of a simulated environment, comprising

the steps of:

providing a parser for each digital data source to be
read;
extracting (102) terrain and culture data from at
least one of a plurality of digital data sources using the

parser for said data source;
transforming the extracted data into a predetermined
central database format from which the extracted data may

be edited, regardless of the particular digital data source
used to receive terrain and culture data;

   characterized in that said transformation step
includes the steps of:


building (114) cross-reference tables for surface
descriptions, feature descriptions and model footprints

from said extracted data;
converting (116) the geometry of said extracted data
to a standard coordinate system to facilitate data base

editing; and
partitioning (120) a geographic area defined by said
extracted data into area blocks of a predetermined size and

storing all of the data associated with each of said area
blocks into a file associated with said area blocks.
The method according to claim 1, further including
the step of editing said central database, and formatting

said edited central database for one of a plurality of
imaging systems.
The method according to claim 2, wherein terrain
elevation and culture data are not merged unto formatting

to enable a reskinning of the terrain.
