<ABSTRACT>
In a transmitter (2) in a coherence multiplexed transmission system the 
output signal of a laser is directly applied to a channel (4) and indirectly 
via
 a plurality 
of cascaded circuits of delay elements (14, 16, 18) and modulators (20, 22, 24). The 

modulators vary a component of the autocorrelation function of the output signal of the 
transmitter (2) as a function of an associated modulation signal (m₁, m₂, m₃). 
In the receiver (6) the autocorrelation functions values of the channel 
output signal for delays (D₁, D₂, D₃) are determined in the demodulators (30, 32, 34). 

These autocorrelation function values form the modulated signal m₁', m₂', m₃'). 
To reduce the number of periodic components of the autocorrelation 
function of the signal source, and hence enhance the possible transmission capacity, the 

transmitter (2) comprises a decorrelation modulator (10) for modulating the signal 
source (12) with pulses generated by a pulse generator (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a multiplex transmission system comprising a 
transmitter which includes at least a signal source coupled to at least a first and a 
second modulator for modulating a first and a second autocorrelation function value 
respectively, of an output signal on an output of the transmitter in response to a first 
and a second modulation signal respectively, the output of the transmitter being coupled 
via a channel to a input of a receiver, the receiver comprising correlation means for 
determining the modulation in at least an autocorrelation function value. The invention likewise relates to a transmitter to be used in such a 
transmission system. A transmission system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from 
the journal article entitled: "Analysis of Optical Crosstalk in Coherence Multiplexed 
Systems Employing a Short Coherence Laser Diode with Arbitrary Power Spectrum", 
by J.P. Goedgebuer et al. in IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. 26, No. 7, 
July 1990. In multiplex transmission systems it is desired to send more signals over a 
single transmission channel. For this purpose, the transmit signals are to be combined to 
a single signal in one way or another. Various techniques to this end are known, such 
as time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing. In time-division multiplexing, samples of the different transmit signals or 
data symbols of the different transmit signals are alternately applied to the channel. In 
this respect it is then necessary that the rate at which the combined signal is applied to 
the channel be at least equal to the sum of the rates at which the individual signals are 
applied to the transmitter. When a large number of different signals are combined to a single time-division 
multiplex signal, a high processing rate is required from the necessary 
electronic components, which leads to a substantial cost price of the system. When frequency-division multiplex is used, each signal to be transmitted 
individually is modulated on its own carrier. A sum signal obtained by adding together  
 
all the carriers to a combined signal, is then transmitted over the channel. The receiver 
needs to comprise filters to reconstitute the separate modulated carriers from the 
combined signal. When there are a large number of signals, a large number of, often 
complex filters, are necessary. In the transmission system known from said journal article, the 
autocorrelation function of a signal supplied by a signal source is modulated by a
