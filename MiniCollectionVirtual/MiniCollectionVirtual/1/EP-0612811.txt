<ABSTRACT>
A room temperature-curable organopolysiloxane composition 
is disclosed, comprising (A) 100 parts by weight of an 

organopolysiloxane terminated with a silanol group or an alkoxy 
group, (B) from 0.1 to 30 parts by weight of an organosilicon 

compound containing more than 2, in average, of hydrolyzable 
groups bonded to the silicon atom per molecule, (C) from 1 to 

650 parts by weight of an oil-absorbing filler which has been 
prepared by impregnating (a) a porous filler with (b) a 

volatile organic compound which is incompatible or partly 
compatible to component (A) and compatible with an organic oily 

substance in an amount of from 1% by weight based on the weight 
of the porous filler up to a saturation amount and, if desired, 

(D) a requisite amount of a curing catalyst. The composition 
exhibits satisfactory adhesion to a substrate in such adhesion 

operation as an FIPG system without requiring wiping of organic 
oily contaminants on the substrate, such as hydrocarbon oils, 

e.g., a rust preventing oil and an engine oil.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an organopolysiloxane 
composition and more particularly a room temperature-curable 
organopolysiloxane composition containing an oil-absorbing 
filler having been subjected to a specific treatment and 
thereby exhibiting good adhesion to a substrate with its 
surface contaminated with organic oily substances, such as 
hydrocarbon oils including a rust preventing oil and an engine 
oil, and therefore useful particularly as a sealing compound 
for forming a gasket in place. As the demand for heat stability of materials to be 
used in automobile engines increases, gaskets made of silicone 
rubber have been broadly used for sealing of an engine and its 
surroundings. In particular, formed-in-place gaskets 
(hereinafter referred to as "FIPG") made from a room 
temperature-curable liquid silicone rubber have been replacing 
conventional cut-to-size gaskets for ease of inventory control 
of gaskets, ease of process control in production of engines, 
and high reliability of sealing performance. The advantages of 
the FIPG system in workability, heat resistance, and the like 
are now highly estimated. Since the engine parts to be sealed are often 
contaminated with organic oily substances such as hydrocarbon  
 
oils, animal or vegetable oils, and synthetic oils as in the 
case that a rust preventing oil is applied or that the parts 
are dipped in an engine oil for smooth assembly, the oily 
contaminants must be wiped off the surface with a cloth, etc. 
before FIPG sealing. However, since the organic oily 
substances, such as hydrocarbon oils, are not completely 
removed, the parts cannot be sealed completely. For example, 
should an oil pan with its surface contaminated be sealed by an 
FIPG system, cases are sometimes met with in which troubles, 
such as leakage of an engine oil, occurs in use. Further, 
while an FIPG sealing compound is automatically coated by means 
of a robot, the above-described wiping operation with a cloth 
is manually conducted, which has been a bar to automation of a 
series of operations. In order to settle these problems, WO 88/500178 
(unexamined published international patent application) 
discloses an adhesive comprising a room temperature-curable 
organopolysiloxane composition and an 
oxime(alkoxy)silylalkylurea compound as a fixing agent. 
However, use of such a fixing agent still fails to make the 
composition adhesive to an oil-contaminated surface and to 
solve the outstanding problems. One object of the present invention is to provide a 
room
