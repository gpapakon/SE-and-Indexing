<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical preparation containing a complex consisting of type B botulinum neurotoxin and stabilizing proteins, both derived from (C. botulinum), admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The preparation is effective for inducing titratable, local, selective muscle denervation in a patient suffering from a disorder characterized by involuntary muscle spasm or contraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING BOTULINUM B COMPLEXBackground of the InventionThe invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing a neurotoxin derived from C. botulinum and methods of using it for selective, local denervation of muscles to treat disorders characterized by uncontrolled muscle activity.Botulinum neurotoxins are produced by certain strains of the bacterial species Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium baratii and Clostridium butyricum. Hatheway in "Bacterial Sources of Clostridial Neurotoxins", Botulinum Neurotoxin and Tetanus Toxin, Simpson, LL(ed), Academic Press, San Diego (1989) classifies the toxins into seven serotypes, designated A through G. The botulinum neurotoxins comprise a family of pharmacologically similar toxins that block acetylcholine release from peripheral nerves. In sufficient doses, they can cause paralysis and death.Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum) is a species which occurs widely in nature and which is a rare cause of food poisoning (i.e.', botulism) from preserved foods which were not properly sterilized before canning. There are seven main types of C_. botulinum strains characterized by antigenically distinct but pharmacologically similar neurotoxins. These very potent neurotoxins can be neutralized only by the specific antitoxin.Type A botulinum toxin is currently approved by the FDA for clinical treatment of certain hyperactive muscle disorders. When locally injected into a striated muscle, botulinum toxin has a series of pharmacologic effects, including denervating the muscle by blocking the release of acetylcholine, thereby diminishing the contractability of the muscle and inducing muscle atrophy. These effects last about 10 to 15 weeks, after which the muscle regains its 

contractability and atrophy is reversed. These effects, e.g., the temporary denervation and contractability, make botulinum toxin a useful treatment for regional movement disorders which are characterized by uncontrolled muscle spasms. Botulinum A toxin has been used to treat a number of segmental movement disorders, including blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, spasmodic torticollis, spasmodic dysphonia and regional hand dystonias.

CLAIMS
1. A pharmaceutical preparation for use in inducing local, partial, titratable, muscle denervation in a patient, the preparation comprising: a frozen, dried preparation comprising C. botulinum type B neurotoxin associated with botulinum-derived stabilizing proteins to form a complex, the complex having a molecular weight as determined by gel filtration chromatography of at least 300 KD, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient for maintaining the stability of the complex at concentrations of 10
4
 mouse LD units per milliliter or less, which, when reconstituted in aqueous solution, retains at least 75% of its toxic activity.
2. The pharmaceutical preparation of Claim 1 characterized as having a pH between 5.0 and 7.3 when reconstituted.
3. The pharmaceutical preparation of Claim 2 having a pH less than about 7.0.
4. The pharmaceutical preparation of Claim 1 which, when reconstituted, retains at least 90% of its toxic activity.
5. The pharmaceutical preparation of Claim 1 wherein the protein excipient is selected from the group consisting of albumin and gelatin.
6. The pharmaceutical preparation of Claim 1 wherein at least one of said stabilizing proteins comprises a red blood cell agglutinating factor coexpressed with the neurotoxin by C. botulinum. 


7. The pharmaceutical preparation of Claim 1 substantially free of bacterial proteins other than said neurotoxin and stabilizing proteins.
8. Use of the reconstituted preparation of claim 1 for the manufacture of a medicament for selectively, partially, temporarily, chemically denervating a volume of muscle in a mammal, by injecting into a point within said muscle volume a dose of the reconstituted compositionl sufficient to reduce involuntary contraction thereof while permitting continuing voluntary contraction, and permitting said dose to diffuse throughout said muscle volume to induce partial denervation thereof.
9. Use accordng to claim 8 further comprising: injecting individual doses of said composition into sites spaced apart within said predetermined volume of muscle, the spatial relationship of the sites being sufficient to at least partially denervate the entirety of said volume.
10. Use according to claim 8 wherein said volume of muscle comprises a single muscle, the method comprising injecting a unit dose of said pharmaceutical, into an innervating zone of said muscle, and permitting said dose to diffuse through said innervating zone to induce partial denervation of the entirety of said muscle.
11. Use of the reconstituted preparation of claim 1 for the manufacture of a medicament for decreasing spasm and involuntary contraction in a muscle of a patient induced by pathologic neural stimulation, by injecting into at least a portion of the innervation zone of a 


muscle the reconstituted preparation in an amount sufficient to diminish spasm and involuntary contraction while permitting voluntary muscle stimulation.
12. Use of the reconstituted preparaion of claim 1 for the manufacture of a medicament or decreasing tremor, rigidity, or spasticity in the muscle of a patient by injecting into at least a portion of the innervation zone of a muscle the reconstituted preparation in an amount sufficient to diminish tremor, rigidity, or spasticity while permitting voluntary muscle stimulation.
13. A frozen, dried botulinum toxin preparation which, when reconstituted in aqueous media, retains greater than 75% of its activity.
14. The toxin preparation of claim 13 which, when reconstituted in aqueous media, retains greater than 90% of its activity.
15. A method of preparing a storage-stabilized botulinum toxin pharmaceutical preparation comprising the step of: freeze-drying a dialyzed, purified toxin in aqueous solution having a pH between 5.0 and 7.3, and containing a stabilizing protein as an excipient.
16. The method of claim 15 wherein said aqueous solution comprises phosphate buffer.
