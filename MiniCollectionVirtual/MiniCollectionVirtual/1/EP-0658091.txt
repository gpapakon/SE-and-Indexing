<ABSTRACT>
An improved ultrasonic pulse-echo method and apparatus that has particular application in making precision measurements of compressibility in any backscattering material, in particular organic tissue, is disclosed. The method employs a standard transducer or transducer containing device which is translated transaxially, thereby compressing or displacing a proximal region of a target body in small known increments. At each increment, a pulse is emitted and an echo sequence (A-line) is detected from regions within the target along the sonic travel path or beam of the transducer. Resulting time shifts in echo segments corresponding to features in the target, corrected for regions of varying sonic speed along the sonic path, provide relative and quantitative information concerning the strain caused by the compressions. The stress imparted by the transducer and containing device is also determined, corrected for depth along the sonic path. The appropriate values for stress are divided into the respective values for strain along each path to yield an elastogram, or array of compressibility values, of the target.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ELASTOGRAPHICMEASUREMENT AND IMAGINGThis invention relates generally to a method and apparatus for performing elastographic diagnosis of a target body. Elastography is a system for measuring and imaging elastic modulus and compressibility distributions m an elastic tissue. It also has application to strain profiling and improved sonographic measurement and imaging. This system is typically based on external compression of a target body, and utilizes one or more transducers, acting as or with a compressor, to generate pre- and post- compression sonic pulses and receive the resulting echo sequences (A-lines) from within the target body. The pre- and post-compression echo sequence pairs may then be cross- correlated or matched to determine the strain along the path of the sonic pulses, and preferably to yield a strain profile of tne target body. This strain profile may then be converted into a compressibility profile or elastogram by measuring the stress imposed by the compressing device and calculating the elastic moduli oased on the stress and the strain profile.An elastogram may be considered to be a special form of multi-trace sonogram, wherein each trace is a record or display witÏ€ depth within a target body of an elastic modulus function of the body. A preferred elastic modulus function for purposes of display s tne inverse of the bulk modulus, which provides a measure of compressibility. As explained later in this description, tne inverse of the 

Young's moduli may usually be used instead of the bulk moduli. Less preferred but also helpful are the Young's moduli themselves. Methods for making and using elastograms are described at length in co-pending application no. 7/535,312.While the methods described in application no. 7/535,312 produce greatly improved records and understanding of structures of elastic tissues, it has been observed that certain inaccuracies in the resulting elastograms may arise. In particular, inaccuracies have been observed if the transducer and compressor used to compress and insonify a tissue are relatively small in size relative to the depth (or thickness) of the target body, giving rise to decreasing stress in the target body as the distance increases from the compressor. Likewise, inaccuracies have been observed in elastograms and sonograms if the target body is not relatively homogeneous with respect to sonic speed, giving rise to strata through which sonic pulses travel at differing velocities.
