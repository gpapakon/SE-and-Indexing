<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for extrusion of plastic plates with very fine-textured surface by means of an extrusion installation equipped with an extruder and a three-roller smoothing unit including one roller with a structure-imparting surface, the installation being designed for coextrusion and the plastic plates being made via two extruders as coextrudate CX consisting of a highly viscous base moulding material and an extruded-on low-viscosity moulding material NF, and being structured superficially via the three-roller smoothing unit, and also Fresnel lenses produced by means of the process and solar collectors manufactured therefrom.

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing plastic sheets having a very
finely structured surface by means of an extrusion

apparatus equipped with an extruder and a three-roller
finishing machine, containing a roller with a structure-generating

surface, characterised in that the apparatus
is designed for coextrusion and the plastics sheets are

produced, using two extruders, as coextruded material CX
comprising a high-viscosity basic moulding composition

BF and a low-viscosity moulding composition NF extruded
on to it, and the plastics sheets are given a surface

structure by means of the three-roller finishing
machine.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the low-viscosity moulding composition NF also contains

mould release agents TM.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the desired structure is embossed into the low-viscosity

moulding composition NF.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the temperature of the embossing roller is up to 70 Â°C

above the glass transition temperature of the low
viscosity moulding composition NF.
Process according to claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that plastic sheets are produced having the surface

structure of a Fresnel lens.
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that
plastic sheets are produced having the surface structure

of a linear Fresnel lens.
Process according to claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the basic moulding composition BF is an acrylic

resin.
Use of the plastic sheets having the surface
structure of a linear Fresnel lens according to claims 5

to 7 as a light-collecting optical element in solar
collectors.
Solar collectors containing at least one tube (13)
containing a heat-carrying liquid and, as the light-collecting

optical element, a linear Fresnel lens (10),
which are associated with one another so that the light

directed through the light-collecting optical element
strikes the tube (23) containing the heat-carrying

liquid, characterised in that the Fresnel lens (10) is
produced by a process according to claim 6.
