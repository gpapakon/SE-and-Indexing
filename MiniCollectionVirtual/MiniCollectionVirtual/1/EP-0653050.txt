<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for position detection using signal patterns created by use of a fixed disk having three conductive patterns disposed thereon. The first and second patterns are annular conductive paths which are coaxial with respect to one another and the third pattern consists of radially extending conductive portions which are electrically connected to the second pattern. A brush carried by a rotating member whose position is sought to be determined is maintained in contact with the first and third pattern. In this manner an electrical signal variation is encountered as the radially extending conductive portions are encountered by the brush upon rotation thereof. This variation is thus correlated to the pattern defined on the third pattern. A microprocessor is used to add or subtract signals as the brush is rotated from a reference position based upon indicia of motor direction. Sequential radially extending conductive portions of said third pattern are arranged into subgroups which provide a unique signature corresponding to the respective position. A stored positional value is updated as rotation is initiated and after sufficient rotation has occurred to identify a subgroup, a comparison is performed to detect the presence of error. If no error is present the position will continue to be updated; adding and subtracting pulses. If an error is detected, the new subgroup and pulse position therein will be accepted as the correct positional value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to position detecting apparatus and, more 
specifically, to position detecting apparatus using a unique pulse pattern to 
define and continuously verify a respective position detection. In many control applications it is necessary to know the position of a 
movable portion of the system. Several methods have been used to 
accomplish such an objective. A first group of methods provides an 
absolute position of the system at any given point. These sensors typically 
utilize a potentiometer which provides a resistance value corresponding to 
a specific position. The advantage of this type of system is that there is 
no loss of reference such that the system requires calibration. A second 
group of position sensors are relative in nature. These systems have a 
zero or calibration point and generate pulses as the system moves from 
this point of calibration. The system position is determined by adding or 
subtracting the pulses that are encountered or generated as the system 
moves from the zero position. Typically, these pulses are provided by use 
of a Hall effect sensor, an optical sensor or a make/break switch 
configuration. The advantage of such a system is its simplicity over the 
absolute sensors. The disadvantage is that if the pulses are counted in the 
wrong direction, the system will not correctly correspond to the position 
indicated. Another disadvantage is that if a stored position is incorrect, 
the system has no means of self calibration to provide continuous error 
correction. DE-A-40 38 284 shows a motor control for a driven member. A 
sensor detects the angular position of the member by determining 
the number of pulses that are established corresponding 
to each of three groups of elements. EP-A-0 047 463 shows an electronic micrometer. By rotating a 
spindle of the micrometer, a count in a control circuit 
determines the position of a disc substrate by sensing a 
contact pattern. A signal is obtained which corresponds to 
the contact pattern that is in registry with brush contacts 
to obtain a reading that represents the spacing at an anvil. WO-A-89/04566 discloses a position indicator which obtains a 
reading by scanning sectors of signal tracks to obtain a 
reading that corresponds to the angular position of the part 
being scanned. GB-A-2 125 645 discloses a rotary digital switch. A controller 
sequentially detects the difference in the switch 
position relative to a so-called set point stored in a ROM.
