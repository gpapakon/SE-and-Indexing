Arm and hand support for a user of a keyboard, drawing or knitting instrument
or device, of the type containing concave anatomical rests for each arm and hand,

characterized by the fact that each support is set out on a corresponding carriage (2),
mounted and movable by rolling on a horizontal plane (1), (1A) and

maintained parallel to a keyboard for example, by supports, and characterized by
pivoting devices (14)/(14)-(15)/(23) provided between the anatomical rests (3), (4),

(5) and the carriage (2), as well as devices to limit forward and backward and linear
movements of the carriage (2).
Arm and hand support according to claim 1, characterized in that the horizontal
plane (1) limiting forward and backward movement of the carriage (2), is defined by at

least two horizontal linear spans of a rail (1A) on which the carriage (2) can be moved
linearly and characterized in that a support-plate (16) for anatomical rests(3), (4), (5),

is pivot mounted on the said carriage (2) for horizontal movement in a plane parallel to
the carriage and which can be directed and moved forwards and backwards.
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the moveable
supports of the anatomical rests (3), (4), (5), are each constituted of a carriage (2)

slide-mounted on a rail (1A), and each receiving a pivot mounted support which can be
directed around a vertical axis (21) and on which a movable sliding block (16) is

mounted forming a support plate to which are attached the said anatomical bases (3),
(4), (5).
Arm and hand support according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the
support plate (16) for anatomical rests (3), (4), (5) can be directed by means of an

arm or connecting rod (15') pivoting firstly on a vertical axis joint (17) located on the
carriage (2) and secondly on another vertical axis joint (18) integrated to the adjustable

support plate (16).
Device according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that each
anatomical base of the forearm is linked to the corresponding support (16) by a flexible

blade (9) in the vertical direction and in that the said support (16) contains means of
adjusting the position of the said blade (10) enabling the position of the base to be

adapted depending on the morphology of the user.
Arm and hand support according to claim 3, characterized in that the adjustable
support (16) is pivot-mounted on the carriage (2) by means of a turning panel (23)

maintained between two fixed parts integrated into the carriage (2) by two ball
bearings (24), (26).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the sliding block adjustable
support (16) forming the forward 
and backward movement system is roller-mounted
over its length and supported on ball bearing paths (6) in a U-shaped part (15)

integrated into the turning panel (23).
Arm and hand support according to claim 4, characterized in that the joint (17)
between the arm or rod (15') and the carriage (2) is located at one end of the carriage,

at the right side for the right arm support and left side for the left arm support. 
Arm and hand support according to claim 1, and one of the claims 4 or 8,
characterized in that the rail support devices are of such a length in relation to their

instrument attachment part, that the distance between the front of the keyboard and
the axis of the rail (1A) is less than the sum, firstly, of the distance between the wrist

support (4) and the joint (18) of the adjustable support plate, and secondly that
separating both joints (17) and (18) of the arm or rod (15'), in such a way that the

support plate (16), in lateral and forward and backward movements, is maintained
more or less perpendicular to the keyboard and that the pivoting arm (15') moves in an

angle in relation to the rail axis (1A), limited to around 30Â°, even in the extreme
positions of the keyboard.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the carriage (2) is supported
on the plane (1) by at least 3 support points (12) over at least one horizontal side of

the said plane (1) to enable both side and forward and backward movements, and in
that front-back and side stops (11) to limit forward and backward travel of each

carriage (2) are provided on at least one of the elements of the carriage (2)/support
plane (1) assembly.
Arm and hand support according to claims 1 and 10, characterized in that
support points (12) comprise balls (6) supported themselves by a circular ball bearing

(13) in relation to the carriage (2) so as to allow for pivot movements apart from side
and backward and forward movements.
Device according to claims 1, 10 or 11, characterized in that the anatomical
bases (3), (4), (5) are located on either side of the carriage (2) forming a support (16)

in such a way that the centre of gravity of the arm resting on the said anatomical
bases is located within the support polygon defined by the spaced positions of the

bases (12).
Arm and hand support according to claims 10 or 11, characterized in that the
carriage (2) at least partially takes in the horizontal movement plane (1) with two

horizontal superposed and parallel supporting sides, and with linking parts (19) on at
least one side between the upper (2.1) and lower (2.2) spaced branches of the base(s)

(12) opposite a distance corresponding to at least the forward and backward
movement of the carriage (2) on the plane (1).
