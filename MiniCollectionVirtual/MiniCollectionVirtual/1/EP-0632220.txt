<ABSTRACT>
A body for taps destined to sanitary fittings which 
include a valve device for controlling the water to be 

delivered, comprising a metal core (11) accommodating 
the valve device and delimiting water inlet and outlet 

ducts, and a case or shell (12) encasing the core. The 
case comprises two shell-shaped moulded plastic 

elements (19-20) completely coupled to each other, in 
which at least one of the said elements is fixed to the 

tube or head (15) with terminal spout.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns taps for sanitary 
fittings in general accommodating mixing valves or 
interception headworks functioning as regulation 
devices for the water to be delivered. More 
particularly, the invention concerns a tap body for 
wash basins, sinks, bidets and the like, as well as for 
bathtub batteries. As regards taps and bathtub batteries, several 
embodiments are known according to which the tap body 
is in synthetic resin and obtained by injection 
moulding. Such embodiments however suffer from 
restrictions and other various problems with regard to 
forms, shrinkage, deformation and above all strength, 
when a body takes part in tap installation and is 
consequently subject to stress during use.  The aim of the present invention is to improve 
structure and assembly of tap bodies or bathtub 
batteries comprising plastic elements, so as to obviate 
said restrictions and solve the above mentioned 
problems. In fact, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a tap body comprising a metal core and a 
plastic case, the latter of simple structure so as to 
permit easy production by moulding for convenient, 
quick and secure assembly, which is not subject to any 
mechanical stress and functioning merely as a jacket 
and as an outside finishing of the tap, in the desired 
and most various shapes. Another object of the invention is to provide a 
composite body for taps in which the water ducts and 
interception valve device are located exclusively in a 
metal core, so as to relieve the resin case of any 
functions involving canalization and water tightness. A body for taps or bathtub batteries according to 
the present invention is substantially as claimed in 
claim 1. The advantage resides in the fact that the 
outside plastic case comprises two complementary 
components of any shape, which can easily be obtained 
by moulding, whose only function is to cover the metal 
core thus giving the tap its final and global shape,  
 
with no need of any further machining. Furthermore, 
such case may be made in any colour, starting from 
adequately pigmented resin. An example of a practical embodiment of the 
invention is illustrated by way of indicative and 
non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, 
wherein: 
Figure 1 shows a view of the separate elements destined 
to form a tap body; Figure 2 shows an axial cross-sectional view of the 
elements illustrated in Fig. 1, assembled and 
accommodating the components of a complete tap; Figure 3 shows a transverse

<CLAIMS>
A composite body for taps destined to sanitary 
fittings which include valve devices for controlling 

the water to be delivered, comprising a core (11) which 
accommodates the valve device and delimits water inlet 

and outlet ducts, and a case or shell (12) encasing the 
core, said core (11) comprising an element (13) 

provided with at least one water inlet duct, a water 
outlet duct (13a) and a seat (13c) accommodating the 

valve device (14), and a tube or head (15) coupled in a 
watertight manner to said outlet duct and including a 

delivery spout, characterized in that the case (12) 
comprises two moulded plastic shell-shaped elements 

(19,20) complementarily coupled to each other, and in 
that at least one of said elements is fixed to the tube 

or head (15) with terminal spout. 
A composite body as claimed in claim 1, wherein, in 
a tap destined to a wash basin or to a bidet, the 

first element (19) of the two elements composing the 
case is bell-shaped and comprises a shell-shaped side 

extension (19') which is located in the middle of its 
height and delimits a concavity facing downwards and 

extending above a side opening provided in said 
element, and wherein the second element (20) of the 

case is shell-shaped and delimits a concavity open 
upwards, said second element (20) having a hook (20') 

 
which permits connection to the base of the first 

element (19) and connection edges which permit coupling 
to the edges of said side extension (19') of the first 

element, the bell-shaped element (19) being designed to 
encase the part (13) of the core (11) accommodating the 

valve device, whereas said extension (19') and said 
second element (20) accommodate the tube or head (15). 
A composite body as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
tube or head (15) is provided with at least one side 

fin (22) and wherein at least the side extension (19') 
of the first case element (12) is fixed to each fin 

(22) of the tube or head. 
A composite body as claimed in claim 3, wherein said 
extension (19') is fixed to said fins (22) by means 

of screws (24). 
A composite body as claimed in claim 3, wherein said 
extension (19') is fixed to said fins (22) by 

ultrasonic welding (23a). 
A composite body as claimed in claim 3, wherein said 
extension (19') is fixed to said fins (22) by means 

of elastic snap-action connection elements (23',23''), 
and wherein the second shell-shaped element (20) is 

provided with a rod (25, 25') designed to be introduced 
between said elastic elements thus blocking them. 
A composite body as claimed in claim 1, wherein, in 
a bathtub battery, the case (30) comprises two 

complementary shell-shaped elements (31, 32) adequately 
assembled to encase a core with a valve device, two 

opposite channels for hot and cold water and a tube or 
head (15) with a terminal spout, said two elements 

being fixed to each other and at least to said tube or 
head by means of screws, snap-action means or 

ultrasonic welding.
