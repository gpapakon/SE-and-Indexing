<ABSTRACT>
Hybrid maize seeds which yield a starch having an amylose content of 80 % or more are disclosed as are starches having that amylose content. Compositions including these high amylose starches are also disclosed. Fractions of high amylose starches which have been formed on the basis of granule size are shown to have enhanced dietary fibre and/or resistant starch content. Such fractions enable the preparation of food compositions of enhanced dietary fibre and/or resistant starch content.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high amylose content
starch.The invention further relates to fractions of
high amylose starch that are enriched in dietary fibre and
resistant starch content whilst claiming a high amylose
content.Most common starches contain approximately 25%
amylose and 75% amylopectin. Amylose is a linear glucose
polymer fraction, whilst amylopectin is a branched glucose
polymer fraction.In the prior art, it has been recognized that
currently available commercial starch having an elevated
amylose content would impart certain desirable properties
to various compositions including films, foods and
industrial products. Accordingly, attempts have been made
in the prior art to produce high amylose content maize.
This is exemplified in AU-A-45616/89 wherein a maize seed
deposited as ATCC No. 40499 is disclosed as capable of
yielding a starch having an amylose content of up to 72%.Typically, however, a commercial starch having an
amylose content of 55-65% would be regarded in the art as
having a high amylose content.In Cereal Chemistry 52(6) 1975. pp. 753-878, Wolf et al. have disclosed
a maize starch containing 81% amylose.The present inventors whilst recognizing the utility
of the commercially available so-called high amylose
starches, have sought to produce a maize having a still
higher amylose content. In the course of a breeding program, a single cross
F1 hybrid maize seed was produced, which carried the ae
amylose extender gene. This seed was found to be capable
of producing grain, in which the amylose content of the
starch derived therefrom was in excess of 80%.Accordingly, in a first aspect, this invention
consists in a hybrid maize seed capable of producing a
starch having an amylose content of more than 80%.In a second aspect, this invention further consists
in a maize starch having an amylose content of more than 90.1%,
physically or chemically modified derivatives
thereof, and destructurized and non-destructurized forms
thereof.In a third aspect, this invention still further
consists in compositions including a maize starch selected
from the group consisting of maize starch having an
amylose content of more than 90.1%, physically or chemically
modified derivatives thereof and destructurized and
non-destructurized forms thereof.These second and third aspects have been made subject
of the claims.In a fourth aspect, this invention still further
consists in a process for the formation of a composition
comprising including a maize starch selected from the
group consisting of maize starch
