<ABSTRACT>
A paper piece conveying system comprising: a driving pulley (22) and a driven pulley (23), which are provided at positions 
apart from each other; a belt (25) passed around these pulleys; a plurality of conveying rollers (27, 28) disposed along the belt 

(25) between the driving pulley (22) and the driven pulley (23); and a driving device (21) for driving the driving pulley (22). In this 
conveying system, respective portions opposed to each other of the respective conveying rollers (27, 28) and of the belt (25) are 

formed such that one portion has a convex portion and the other has a concave portion complementary to the convex portion. 
With respect to the belt (25), the respective conveying rollers (27, 28) are provided such that the convex portion of one member 

intrudes into the concave portion of the other member, and the both members are disposed in non-contact state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper strip transporting 
apparatus and in particular to a paper strip transporting 
apparatus using a belt. In an apparatus or facility which processes paper strips, in 
particular an apparatus into which bills or bank notes are inserted 
as payment, such as automatic lending machines, it is necessary to 
collect bank notes. For example, a number of game media lending 
machines for lending game media used for playing games are 
installed in game parlors. Collecting of bank notes which have 
been inserted into the game media lending machines is carried 
out. There are problems that collecting of bank notes from 
lending machines is troublesome and accidental loss and/or 
stealing of bank notes is liable to occur. Therefore, a transporting 
apparatus which accepts the inserted bank notes and transports 
them to a destination such as cash box is required for several 
game media lending machines. For example, in game parlors, a plurality of game machines 
and a plurality of game media lending machines are arranged into 
one group. A plurality of the groups are arranged into an island.  
 
For each group, there is provided a transporting apparatus for 
collecting the bank notes inserted into a plurality of game media 
lending machines to one position. Such type of paper strip transporting apparatus including 
drive and driven pulleys and a belt arranged between and around 
the pulleys have been heretofore used. A plurality of transporting 
rollers are disposed along the belt and between the drive and 
driven pulleys. This causes the bank notes to be sandwiched 
between the rollers and the belt and to be transported together 
with the belt by the frictional force thereof. The transporting 
rollers are disposed in pressure contact with the belt for bringing 
the paper strip into pressure contact with the belt. The transporting rollers are constantly in pressure contact 
with the belt in the conventional transporting apparatus. 
Accordingly, the transporting rollers are constantly driven to 
rotate by the belt independently of presence or absence of the 
bank note. Therefore, there is a problem that the belt is liable to 
break due to wear of the portion which is contact with the 
transporting rollers. In other words, there is a problem in that the 
durability of the belt is low. The transporting rollers have a 
similar problem of wear. Noise which is generated due to continuous rotation of all 
transporting rollers is not negligible. It is a first object of the present
