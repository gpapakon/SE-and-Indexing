<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit arrangement for freeing a multiplex signal from ignition interference in a radio receiver, preferably in a car radio, the multiplex signal is passed as a digital signal with a sampling frequency of a multiple of the pilot audio frequency via a high-pass filter and a squaring circuit. The high-pass-filtered and squared multiplex signal and a time average of the high-pass-filtered and squared multiplex signal are compared with one another. In the event of deviations which are larger than a predetermined amount, a control signal of predetermined duration is formed, which controls a correction circuit in such a way that sampled values of the multiplex signal which occur during the control signal are replaced by sampled values which occur during the preceding period of the pilot tone.

Circuit arrangement for eliminating ignition
interference from a multiplex signal in a radio receiver,

preferably in a car radio, characterized

in that the multiplex signal is routed as a digital
signal with a sampling rate of a multiple of the

pilot tone frequency via a high-pass filter (3) and
a squaring circuit (4),
in that the high-pass-filtered and squared multiplex
signal and an average value over time of the high-pass-filtered

and squared multiplex signal are
compared with one another,
in that in the event of deviations which are greater
than a predetermined measure, a control signal of

predetermined duration is formed, and
in that the control signal controls a correction
circuit (10) in such a way that samples of the

multiplex signal which occur during the control
signal are replaced by samples occurring during the

preceding period of the pilot tone.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the squaring circuit comprises a circuit

for absolute-value formation.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the average value

over time is formed with the aid of a low-pass filter
(5), whose cut-off frequency lies in the range between

100 Hz and 1000 Hz.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the correction

circuit (10) is formed by a first delay device (11), 
which effects compensation of the propagation delay in

the high-pass filter (3) and, if appropriate, in the
squaring circuit (4) and of the propagation delay during

the comparison of the output voltage with the average
value over time, a controllable changeover switch (12),

to which the control signal can be fed, and a second
delay device (13) by one period of the pilot tone.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the controllable switch is a changeover

switch (12) to which the multiplex signal which has
passed through the first delay device (11) and the

multiplex signal which has passed through the second
delay device (13) can be fed, and in that an output of

the changeover switch (12) forms the output (14) of the
correction circuit (10) and is connected to an input of

the second delay device (13).
