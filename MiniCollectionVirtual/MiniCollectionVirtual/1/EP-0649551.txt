<ABSTRACT>
An alarm device for an electrical apparatus is provided which provides an alarm signal when the electrical apparatus is moved whilst unplugged from its electrical supply. The alarm device may be supplied with an over-ride means for preventing the initiation or continuation of the alarm signal. The alarm device can be provided inside the protected electrical apparatus, or it can be provided as a separate device which is fixed securely to the protected apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
ALARM CIRCUITThe present invention relates to an alarm device. More particularly the invention relates to an alarm device for electrical equipment which is supplied with electrical power from an external source such as the mains system.There are many small and portable mains-connected apparatus such as hi-fi equipment, computers and televisions. These pieces of equipment tend to be valuable and easily disposable and hence are attractive to thieves. Shops, offices and hotels all encounter problems in preventing the theft of these items since they may easily be removed by unplugging the piece of equipment from the mains and carrying it away. Previously various methods have been tried to prevent such theft occurring. For example many shops chain their valuable hi-fi equipment to the display stands to prevent theft. However this is very cumbersome and prevents easy transfer of equipment when required. In addition security is not assured since by mistake the chains may not be secured. Furthermore a determined thief would be able to cut through most available mechanical locking mechanisms with the correct equipment. This invention thus seeks to provide a reliable automatic alarm device for electrical equipment. According to the present invention there is provided an alarm device for an electrical apparatus supplied with electrical power from an external source, having a detector to detect whether the electrical apparatus is connected to the external source; a sensor to sense movement of the electrical apparatus; and alarm means to provide an alarm signal when the detector detects that the electrical apparatus is not connected to the source and the sensing means detects movement of the electrical apparatus. 

 This alarm device therefore prevents the movement of the electrical apparatus once the external electrical supply has been removed.The alarm device may provide an alarm signal to an external alarm system when the detector detects that the electrical apparatus is not connected to the external source and the sensing means detects movement of the electrical apparatus.This enables different electrical devices to be monitored from a central location.Further the alarm device may provide an alarm signal to the external alarm system and to an internal alarm generating means alternately.The alarm device may further include a timer means which causes the alarm signal to be discontinued when a predetermined time has elapsed since the alarm signal was initiated.This feature minimises the power drain on the alarm

CLAIMS
1. An alarm device for an electrical apparatus supplied with electrical power from an external source, having a detector to detect whether the electrical apparatus is connected to the external source; a sensor to sense movement of the electrical apparatus; and alarm means to provide an alarm signal when the detector detects that the electrical apparatus is not connected to the source and the sensing means detects movement of the electrical apparatus.
2. An alarm device as claimed in claim 1 wherein the alarm device provides the alarm signal to an external alarm system when the detector detects that the electrical apparatus is not connected to the external source and the sensing means detects movement of the electrical apparatus.
3. An alarm device as claimed in claim 2 wherein the alarm device alternately provides the alarm signal to the external alarm system and to an internal alarm generating means.
4. An alarm device as claimed in claim 3 wherein the duration of the alarm signal supplied to the external alarm system and to the internal alarm generating means is selectable by the user. 5. An alarm device as claimed in any preceding claim further including a timer means which causes the alarm signal to be discontinued after a predetermined time.
6. An alarm device as claimed in claim 5 wherein the alarm signal may be re-initiated after the predetermined time if the detector detects that the apparatus is not connected to the source and further movement is detected.
7. An alarm device as claimed in any preceding claim which includes an internal source of power.
8. An alarm device as claimed in claim 7 wherein 


the internal source of electrical power stores energy supplied from the external source for the electrical apparatus.
9. An alarm circuit as claimed in claim 8 wherein the internal source of electrical power is a rechargeable battery.
10. An alarm device as claimed in any preceding claim further comprising an over-ride means for preventing the initiation or continuation of the alarm signal.
11. An alarm device as claimed in claim 10 in which the over-ride means can only be operated while the detector detects that the electrical apparatus is connected to the external power source. 12. An alarm device as claimed in any preceding claim further comprising indicating means for confirming that the alarm device has been activated.
13. An alarm device as claimed in any preceding claim further comprising warning means for indicating that an alarm signal has been initiated.
14. An alarm device as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the detector detects a voltage which is dependent upon the external electrical supply to the electrical apparatus. 15. An alarm device substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings. 16. An alarm circuit for an electrical apparatus supplied with power from an external source, which receives a control signal indicating whether the apparatus is connected to the external source, and also receives an indication signal which indicates that an alarm situation has occurred, which generates an output alarm signal when a control signal indicating disconnection of the apparatus from the external supply and an indication signal are received simultaneously.
