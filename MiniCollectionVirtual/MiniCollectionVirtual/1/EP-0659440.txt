<ABSTRACT>
A calcium-modified oxidized cellulose hemostat provides 
faster hemostasis than does either unmodified or sodium- 

or potassium-modified oxidized cellulose. The percentage 
by weight of calcium in the modified oxidized cellulose 

must be in a range between about 0.5 and about 4, in order 
to enhance hemostasis, while not interfering excessively 

with bioabsorbability. In a second embodiment, an oxidized 
cellulose hemostat is modified with both calcium and 

either sodium or potassium. The second embodiment may be 
used to deliver acid-sensitive materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a
bioresorbable hemostat by treating oxidized cellulose with
calcium or a combination of calcium and sodium or
potassium.Oxidized cellulose fabrics are bioresorbable and absorbent
fabrics that have long been used in medical applications.
Both naturally-occurring and regenerated cellulose can be
oxidized. For convenience and brevity, we refer to both
as "oxidized cellulose." Three examples of such a fabric
are Interceed* (TC7) Absorbable Adhesion Barrier,
Surgicel* Absorbable Hemostat and Surgicel Nu-Knit*
Absorbable Hemostat (all available from Johnson & Johnson
Medical, Inc., Arlington, TX). However, all these
materials are acidic. The pH of the aqueous phase of 1 g
of Interceed Barrier suspended in 100 ml of purified water
is approximately 4.1. The surface pH of a fully water-saturated
piece of fabric is about 1.7. Materials such as
thrombin, tissue plasminogen activator analogue (t-PAA),
and other highly acid-sensitive materials are inactivated
immediately on such matrices, precluding their use for
delivery of these materials to a surgical site.
Alternatively, if such a material is to be delivered on an
oxidized cellulose fabric, the fabric must first be
neutralized. Thus, past efforts to modify oxidized 
cellulose in order to improve its properties have
generally focused on neutralizing the material.Doub et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 2,517,772, describe the
impregnation of neutralized oxidized cellulose products
with thrombin. They disclose a method of neutralizing
oxidized cellulose cloth with an aqueous sodium
bicarbonate solution (Example 2) or an aqueous calcium
acetate solution (Example 1). Example 2 of the Doub et
al. patent discloses neutralizing oxidized cellulose gauze
with an aqueous solution of strongly basic sodium
bicarbonate and then impregnating the neutralized product
with thrombin. The thrombin impregnated gauze is then
frozen and dried from the frozen state to provide a
highly hemostatic surgical dressing. The patent does not
disclose any practical data pertaining to testing in
animals.Dol'berg et al., FarmZh. (Kiev) 1971,26(2),53-56, studied
the hemostatic properties of oxidized cellulose and
combined the material with various pharmaceutical
compounds. They report that the sodium and potassium
salts of oxidized cellulose can be used in medicine and
that the potassium salt has advantages over the acid form,
in that it is neutral and is compatible with many
pharmaceutical substances.Barinka et al., in British Patent Specification
