<ABSTRACT>
A mechanical coupling comprises an input member (12,50), an output 
member (14,52) a chamber (16) associated therewith, within the chamber (16) a 

charge (35,55) of cured silicone composition in crumb form and means 
(28,58) for 

compressing the charge (35,55) to an extent sufficient to permit the 
compressed silicone to convey rotational motion from the input 

member (12,50) to the output member (14,52). A clutch (Fig.1) and a 
variable torque rate torsion bar (Fig.2) are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in or 
relating to mechanical couplings. Mechanical coupling devices generally comprise 
mechanical parts arranged to be moved into and out of 
frictional engagement. Such devices are used in machines 
to transmit or interrupt movement of parts of the machine 
as for example slip clutches or brakes on vehicles. Such 
devices may be actuated by mechanical, pneumatic or 
hydraulic means. Silicone fluids have been proposed for use as 
hydraulic fluids for power brakes. They are known for 
their stability at extreme temperatures and hydrophobicity. 
It has also been proposed to employ silicone fluids in 
torque transmitting devices in which torque is transmitted 
from one set of plates to another in a slip clutch. One 
disadvantage of liquids in mechanical coupling devices is 
that if a leak occurs, it may cause undesirable conditions 
and the clean up may be difficult. On the other hand, the 
use of solid materials as hydraulic medium is limited 
because most solids do not readily move and transfer 
pressure as conveniently as liquids. Nevertheless it has 
been proposed to employ silicone materials in the form of 
cured rubber in crumb form as a "hydraulic" medium. Solid 
materials in the form of crumb rubber are reported for 
example in U.S. patent specifications 4,670,530 and 
3,843,601 which disclose a silicone crumb in a fine 
particulate form that readily flows like a liquid, does not 
agglomerate and can be repeatedly recycled between crumb 
and clear liquid appearing material. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
an improved mechanical coupling device.  The invention provides in one of its aspects a 
mechanical coupling device comprising an input member, an 
output member and a chamber associated therewith, said 
chamber containing a particulate charge and having means 
for compressing or releasing the charge, wherein the charge 
consists of a cured silicone rubber composition in crumb 
form which is free of electromechanical and electro-rheological 
additive wherein the construction and 
arrangement of the compressing means is such that it is 
capable of compressing the silicone rubber charge to a 
condition in which it provides a mechanical coupling 
between the input member and the output member to transmit 
rotational movement from one member to the other. A device according to the invention is intended for 
use in transmitting torque from one driven member to 
another. In a device according to the invention, as long 
as the silicone
