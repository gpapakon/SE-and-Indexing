<ABSTRACT>
A process for separating linear internal olefins from branched internal olefins. There is provided a process for converting a feedstock of linear internal olefins and branched internal olefins to a primarily linear internal olefin composition having a lower concentration of branched internal olefins than present in the feedstock, by: a) contacting the feedstock with a linear polyaromatic, optionally substituted, compound under conditions effective to form a linear polyaromatic compound-linear internal olefin adduct; b) separating the linear polyaromatic compound-linear internal olefin adduct from the reaction mixture; c) dissociating the linear polyaromatic compound-linear internal olefin adduct to form linear polyaromatic compound and a linear internal olefin composition; and optionally d) separating the linear polyaromatic compound formed in step c) from a linear internal olefin composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for separating
linear internal olefins from branched internal olefins.Many industrial processes produce olefins that are
mixtures of linear internal olefins and branched alpha
olefins. Olefins are frequently used in the manufacture
of polymers or as drilling mud additives, or as
intermediates for the production of oil additives and
detergents. Depending upon the particular application, it
would be desirable to manufacture a linear internal
olefin composition having the greatest purity possible.
For example, detergents manufactured from linear internal
olefins are more biodegradable than detergents derived
from many industrially manufactured olefin streams
containing branched internal olefins. While pure
species of linear internal olefins with a narrow carbon
number range can be manufactured or produced in small
quantities at a great cost, we have found that it would
be particularly desirable to economically provide large
quantities of a purified linear internal olefins from raw
feedstocks containing a mixture of linear internal
olefins and branched internal olefins.Separating and isolating linear internal olefins from
branched internal olefins is no easy task, especially
when these species have similar or identical molecular
weights or carbon numbers. Conventional distillation
methods are inadequate to separate species of this type
which have such closely related boiling points. The
separation problem is further aggravated in that the 
linear internal olefin species not only needs to be
separated from branched internal olefins, but also from
everything else present in the feedstock mixture, such as
saturated hydrocarbons. US Patent No. 4,946,560
described a process for the separation of internal
olefins from alpha olefins by contacting a feedstock with
anthracene to form an olefin adduct, separating the
adduct from the feedstock, dissociating the anthracene-linear
alpha olefin adduct through heat to produce
anthracene and an olefin composition enriched in alpha
olefin, and separating out the anthracene from the alpha
olefin. We have found it desirable, however, to produce
an olefin stream which is rich in linear internal
olefins.This invention relates to a process for separating
linear internal olefins from branched internal olefins.
In particular, there is provided a process for converting
a feedstock, comprising linear internal olefins and
branched internal olefins to a linear internal olefin
composition having a lower concentration of branched
internal olefins than
