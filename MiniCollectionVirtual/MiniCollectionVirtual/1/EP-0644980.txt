<ABSTRACT>
The corner area (5) has a cornerpiece (3) inserted between two ends (4) lying at an angle of the sides (2) of a sealing frame and linked thereto. In order to ensure that the cornerpiece (3) remains dimensionally stable when the sealing frame is compressed, the sealing frame is provided with recesses (9). In order to allow the cornerpiece to be produced in the most simple manner by an injection molding process, said recesses (9) lie at an angle with the cavities (8) inside the ends (4), which are also provided for deformation purposes.

Corner region of a sealing frame for a tunnel tubbing, 
which is composed of the ends of two sides (2) of the 

sealing frame (1), which consist of sealing profile 
strips and run at an angle to one another, and of a 

corner piece (3) connecting these ends (4), wherein the 
sealing profile strips are provided with grooves (6) and 

cavities (7, 8) extending continuously in their 
longitudinal direction and into the ends in their cross-section, 

and the corner piece (3) has recesses (9, 9'), 
which run at an angle to the grooves (6) and cavities 

(7, 8) of one as well as the other end (4) and are open 
at least towards the inside of the sealing frame (1), 

characterised in that the recesses (9, 9') in the corner 
piece (3) respectively run at 45° to the cavities (7, 

8); and that there are as many recesses (9, 9') 
respectively located one above the other on both sides 

of a diagonal leading from the outer corner (10) to the 
inner corner (11) of the corner piece (3) as there are 

grooves (6) on each side (2). 
Corner region according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the recesses (9') terminate before the respective 

outside (13) of the corner piece (3) in a plane (12') 
running parallel to this outside (13) in order to attain 

a constant wall thickness (d) of the end piece. 
Corner region according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the recesses (9) terminate before the respective 

outside (13) of the corner piece (3) in a plane (12) 
running at an angle to this outside (13), i.e in such a 

way that the wall thickness (d) of the corner piece (3) 
increases out from its corner (10) towards the ends (4) 

of the frame sides (2).  
 
Corner region according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the wall thickness or the minimum wall thickness 

(d) respectively amounts to at least one third of the 
diameter of a recess (9, 9') or of the smallest diameter 

of a recess which is not circular in cross-section. 
Corner region according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the ends (4) of the frame sides (2) are cut at 45° 

in such a way that their end faces (14) run parallel to 
the longitudinal axes of the recesses (9, 9') of the 

corner piece (3). 
Corner region according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the cavities (7, 8) are sealed at the end faces by 

means of plugs (16). 
Corner region according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that each plug (16) has a minimum length (1) which 

corresponds to the smallest diameter (D) of the cavity 
blocked by it at the respective end.
