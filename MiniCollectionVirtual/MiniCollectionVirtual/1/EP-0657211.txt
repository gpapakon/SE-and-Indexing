<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst system including a hydrogenation catalyst on a support which includes at least one alkali and/or alkaline-earth metal and at least one fluorine compound of aluminium. Process for dehydrochlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons, more particularly of chlorofluorohydrocarbons by means of hydrogen and in the presence of a catalyst system including a hydrogenation catalyst, especially palladium, on such a support.
