<ABSTRACT>
The asymmetric contact comprises a first terminal part for connection to an external conductor and a second terminal part for elastically connecting to another similar contact. It is characterised in that the said second terminal part (4) is axially off-centred with respect to the first terminal part (1, 2, 3) and with respect to the part (8) coupling these parts together and has a width substantially half that of the said first terminal part. Application: terminal strip for computer local networks.

<CLAIMS>
A terminal strip comprising contacts of a first
type and of a second type, the contacts of the first type

being identical with each other, and the contacts of the
second type being identical with each other, said contacts

being disposed in two parallel rows in the terminal strip,
facing each other in each row and defining successive pairs of

contacts in each row, each of said contacts being of flat
elongate shape and having a first planar terminal part for

connecting a conductor accessible on one face of the terminal
strip, a second terminal part opposite the first for

connecting this contact to the facing contact, narrower than
the first terminal part and the projection of which in the

plane of said first terminal part is offset axially relative
thereto, and an intermediate part for coupling said terminal

parts, the second terminal parts of said facing contacts being
arched and elastically connected to the inside of the terminal

strip, 
characterised in that
 the two contacts (10, 10') of
each of said pairs and the adjacent contacts of two

consecutive pairs are disposed symmetrically to each other on
respective opposite sides of a plane between the two contacts

and have between the second terminal parts (4,4') of the
contacts of each pair a distance between centres (d1) which is

small in comparison to the relatively large distance between
centres (d2) of the second terminal parts of adjacent contacts

of two different consecutive pairs.
