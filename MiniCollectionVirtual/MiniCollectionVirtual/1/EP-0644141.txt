<ABSTRACT>
A series of air jets (9,18) which is directed 
towards the lower face of a piece of textile material or fabric (7) 

which is to be uncoiled towards a lay-out table, the air jets (9,18) 
being situated in the interstice defined by the lower face of 

the said textile or fabric material (7) and the slide plates (8) which 
guide the material towards the said lay-out table for uncoiling 

thus ensuring a smooth entry and orderly passage of the material 
to the table. Also provided are outlets for free air (16,23) adjacent 

to the low pressure air jets (9,18) so as to compensate for any 
unbalance caused by the air jets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention patent discloses improvements to 
the machinery used for uncoiling pieces of fabric material 
from a roll or reel. Machinery for this purpose, to which these 
improvements apply are well known in the state of the art 
for the handling of textile materials in roll form in the 
clothing and similar trades. The machines used for laying out material from rolls 
on to a table for operations such as folding ,etc., comprise 
generally a long table with guides for defining the movement 
of a carriage which takes up the full width of the table 
and which supports the roll of textile material so that 
it can be laid out on the table in a controlled manner 
and be submitted to various manipulations. The said carriage 
comprises the means of holding the roll in such a manner 
that it can be unrolled and also the mechanism for unrolling 
and guiding the piece, starting and stopping the movement 
on the table, etc. Frequently the carrying unit incorporates 
a cutting device on its forward end such that apart from 
unrolling the material and laying it out on the table the 
machine has the means for transverse cutting the material 
to a required length, the cutting mechanism having 
transverse guides for its displacement and for other 
ancilliary devices. Relevant to the machines as described for uncoiling 
rolls of fabric materialare the objects of the Spanish 
patents nos. 8900577 and 8902432 of this same applicant.  All currently known machines for laying out fabric 
materials on the work table from rolls have the problems 
associated with the correct issue and alignment of the 
edge of the piece on the inclined guide plane feeding to 
the table. These problems are particularly frequent on 
extracting the initial extremity of the roll through the 
front section of the carriage on commencing the layout 
operation. Currently this initial phase has to be carried 
out manually so as to avoid the creasing or misalignment 
which generally occurs, this manual stage being especially 
onerous. The improvements as disclosed in this patent are 
designed to obviate completely the above mentioned 
difficulties by introducing technical means to the carriage 
carrying the roll or the piece of textile material as well 
asto the cutting device which is associated with 
it. In practical terms the inventors who are applying 
for this patent have found that by means of a combination 
of air jets at low pressure directed within the space 
between the fabric material and the guide plate in the 
form of a multiplicity of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Improvements to machines for uncoiling fabrics 
in roll form characterized by multiple air jets which 

are directed towards the lower side of the piece of fabric 
being unrolled from the machine towards the layout table, 

the said jets being situated within the interstice 
determined by the lower side of the said fabric material 

and the slide plates guiding the said fabric piece on 
to the table where it is to be laid out or unrolled, thus 

ensuring a smooth and regular passage of the material. 
Improvements to machines for uncoiling fabrics 
in roll form as in Claim 1, characterized by the provision 

of entries for free air adjacent to the low pressure air 
jets so as to compensate for the unbalance of any 

localized pressure caused by the air jets. 
Improvements to machines for uncoiling fabrics 
in roll form, as in Claim 1, characterized in that the 

low pressure air outlets are arranged in two groups each 
respectively between the axis of symmetry of the piece 

of fabric and one of its edges such that the air jets 
in each of the two groups are directed at a certain angle 

with respect to the corresponding edge or border of the 
piece of fabric. 
Improvements to machines for uncoiling fabrics 
in roll form, as in Claim 1, characterized in that the 

low pressure air jets take the form of an alignment of 
orifices in a distribution manifold of low pressure air 

situated transversally with respect to the piece of fabric. 
Improvements to machines for uncoiling fabrics 
in roll form as in Claim 4, characterized in that the 

low pressure air tubing is of a small bore so as to ensure 
a high air velocity in the transverse distribution piping. 
Improvements to machines for uncoiling fabrics 
in roll form, as in Claim 5, characterized in that the 

entry of low pressure air is central to the transverse 
distribution manifold. 
Improvements to machine for uncoiling fabrics 
in roll form, as in Claim 1, characterized in that the 

low pressure air jets are orientated at a slight angle 
to the slide plates.
