<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and a device for monitoring
and controlling of a compressor, said compressor comprising a rotor and a
housing, said rotor being rotatably mounted within said housing for rotation
about a rotational axis with variable or constant rotational speed, said
compressor further comprising at least one compressor stage, each of said at
least one stages comprising a row of rotor blades mounted on said rotor and
being arranged one following the other in a circumferential direction with
respect to said rotational axis and of a row of stator blades mounted on said
housing and being arranged one following the other in a circumferential
direction with respect to said rotational axis.The invention provides for an early detection and reporting of changes in
blade-loading for either multi- or single-stage compressors with the possibility
of being able to control the compressor in accordance with the reported changes.
A compressor may be operated as an isolated unit (for example as large pump or
process compressor in the chemical or petroleum industry) or in conjunction
with a power-turbine engine, as would be the case in a power plant operation.
The compressor may further be part of a gas turbine used for driving
aeroplanes, ships or large vehicles. The compressor may be a radial type
compressor or preferably an axial type compressor.Compressors consist of a series of rotating or stationary blade rows in
which the combination of a rotor (circular rotating blade row) and a stator
(circular stationary blade row) forms one stage. Inside the rotor, kinetic energy
is transferred to the gas flow (usually air) by the individual airfoil blades. In
the following stator, this energy is manifested as a pressure rise in the gaseous
air as a consequence of deceleration of the gaseous air flow. This deceleration of
the gaseous air flow is induced as a result of the design of the stator section.
The pressure ratio (exit pressure/inlet pressure) of a single stage is limited
because of intrinsic aerodynamic factors, so several stages are connected
together in many turbo compressors to achieve higher pressure ratios than
could be achieved by a single stage. The maximum achievable pressure ratio of a turbo compressor is
established by the so-called stability limit of the compressor given by the
characteristic of the compressor and the gaseous air flowing through the
compressor at any time. As the pressure in the compressor increases, the
aerodynamic loading on the compressor blades must also
