<ABSTRACT>
The holder has a U-shaped strap (1) attached to the vehicle chassis via its base (3) and supporting an attachment (4) secured to the vehicle headlamp between its opposing arms (2). The attachment has a bore (5), transverse to the optical axis, receiving a rigid spacer sleeve (6), fitted with at least 2 elastic cuffs (7), acting against a stop shoulder (9) within the bore. Pref. the stop shoulder divides the bore into 2 equal halves, each receiving a respective spacer sleeve fitted with an elastic cuff.

<CLAIMS>
Holder for an adjustable fitting for headlamps, in particular 
vehicle headlamps, comprising a U-shaped yoke (1), its web (3) 

which connects both shanks (2) being seated on a vehicle body, 
an extension (4) which is rigidly connected to the headlamp and 

arranged between the shanks (2) of the U-shaped yoke (1) and 
into which is placed a throughbore (5) into which is inserted a 

rigid and sleeveshaped spacer (6), having pushed onto the 
spacer (6) an elastic sleeve (7) which establishes an elastic 

connection between the U-shaped yoke (1) and the extension 
(4) of the headlamp, and with a pivotal axis, which extends 

transversely to the optical axis of the headlamp and which is 
formed by a threaded bolt (8), which is carried by the shanks (2) 

and which passes through the sleeveshaped spacer (6) and by 
means of which the spacer (6) is clamped between the shanks 

(2) of the U-shaped yoke (1), 
characterised in that
 the elastic 
connection between the shanks (2) of the U-shaped yoke (1) 

and the extension (4) which is rigidly connected to the headlamp 
is established by at least two elastic sleeves (7) between which 

is arranged a shoulder (9) which is integrated with the inside of 
the throughbore (5), and with firm abutment of shanks (2) 

against the sleeveshaped spacer (6) between one of the two 
shanks (2) of the U-shaped yoke (1) and the should (9) of the 

extension (4), each elastic sleeve (7) is compressed in the 
direction of the pivotal axis. 
Holder according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the spacer 
(6) passes with play through the section of throughbore (5) 

which includes the shoulder (9). 
Holder according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
elastic sleeves (7) are seated with play onto the spacer (6) and 

are inserted with play into the throughbore (5). 
Holder according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 
the elastic sleeves (7) protrude from the throughbore (5) with  

 
the end section (10) which is facing towards the shanks (2) of 

the U-shaped yoke (1). 
Holder according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 
between the elastic sleeves (7) and adjacent shank (2) of the U-shaped 

yoke (1) is inserted a respective circular disc (11), which 
accommodates the spacer (6) thereinbetween in a clamped 

state and between which the elastic sleeves (7) are compressed 
without directly abutting the extension (4) of the headlamp. 
Holder according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 
the spacer (6) is designed in two parts, and each part of the 

spacer (6) is of equal length and integrated with its adjacent 
circular disc (11) of plastic. 
Holder according to Claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that
 the 
discs (11) radially protrude the elastic sleeves (7) with their 

outer peripheral edge and peripherally have a small gap to the 
extension (4). 
Holder according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 
a non-rotational connection is established between the discs 

(11) and the extension (4) of the headlamp by way of 
interengaging fixing elements (12, 13, 14, 15) between both the 

sleeve (6) and the shoulder (9) of the extension (4) and between 
the sleeve (7) and the disc (11) adjacent sleeve (7). 
Holder according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 
interengaging peaks (11 or 14) or troughs (12 or 13) serve a 

fixing elements. 
Holder according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 
the elastic sleeves (7) which are compressed between the 

shanks (2) of the U-shaped yoke (3) are pretensionally seated 
with the casing surface on the inside of the throughbore (5) of 

the extension (4).
