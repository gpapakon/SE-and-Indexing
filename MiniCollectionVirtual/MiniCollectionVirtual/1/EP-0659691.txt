<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to treating solutes in
liquid solutions for the purpose of making the
solutions more acceptable for discharge into the
environment. More particularly, the invention concerns
oxidizing the solutes by electrolyzing the solutions
with certain types of anodes that provide various
advantages.Many industrial waste streams possess
characteristics which restrict or preclude their
discharge to municipal treatment facilities.
Contaminants in wastewater may be organic or inorganic
in nature and often are found in combination with one
another. Some of the parameters which are regulated
are the solution's chemical oxygen demand (COD), total
organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon
(DOC). There are also many specific compounds and
classes of compounds which are regulated. Examples of
these are toxic ions such as cyanide and classes of
toxic organic materials such as phenols.
Electrochemical oxidation is a convenient technique for
reducing the amount of undesirable organic compounds
and other oxidizable species in a given solution to a
level which is acceptable for discharge to a treatment
facility.Environmental regulations are becoming
stricter around the world. Some effluents which were
once sewerable must now be collected and hauled away
for disposal, putting additional economic stress on
manufacturers. It is therefore desirable to have a
simple and efficient way of treating effluents in a way
which will enable them to be discharged directly to the
sewer.The electrolytic treatment of wastewaters has
been the subject of many patents, journal articles and 
technical presentations over the last few years. See,
for example, US-A-4,014,766; US-A-4,399,020; US-A-4,308,122;
US-A-4,839,007; and US-A-5,160,417 and
Gattrell, M. and Kirk, D. W., "The Electrochemical
Oxidation of Aqueous Phenol at a Glassy Carbon
Electrode" Can. J. of Chem. Eng., vol. 68 (Dec. 1990)
pp. 997-1001. The advantages of electrolytic oxidation
of wastes over chemical or thermal processes are the
ease of operation, simplicity of design and relatively
small equipment space requirements. Electrolysis is
also considered to be relatively safe to operate when
compared to oxidative treatment techniques which
necessitate handling powerful chemical oxidants.However, there are a number of problems and
drawbacks associated with many known methods of
electrolytic oxidation of solutes in wastewaters. Such
problems and drawbacks appear to result in part from
the particular materials which constitute the anodes
employed in such
