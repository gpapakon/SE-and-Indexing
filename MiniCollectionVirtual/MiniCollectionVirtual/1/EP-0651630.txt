<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins, panty liners, and incontinence pads. More particularly, the present invention relates to absorbent articles, such as sanitary napkins, that have longitudinal side edge components (52) that naturally wrap the sides (22) of a wearer's panties which provide an alternative to conventional side flaps. The side edge components are extensible, and may be attached inboard of the longitudinal edges of the main body of the article, or be decoupled from the main body, or comprise part of the impervious backsheet of the main body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as
sanitary napkins, panty liners, and incontinence pads. More
particularly, the present invention relates to sanitary napkins
that have longitudinal side edge components that naturally wrap
the sides of a wearer's panties which provide an alternative to
conventional side flaps.Absorbent articles such as sanitary napkins, pantiliners, and
incontinence pads are devices that are typically worn in the
crotch region of an undergarment. These devices are designed to
absorb and retain liquid and other discharges from the human body
and to prevent body and clothing soiling. Sanitary napkins are a
type of absorbent article worn by women in a pair of panties that
is normally positioned between the wearer's legs, adjacent to the
perineal area of the body. Sanitary napkins both with and without
side flaps (or wings) are disclosed in the literature and are
available in the marketplace. Some particularly preferred
sanitary napkins that do not require flaps are described in U.S. 
Patents 4,950,264 and 5,009,653 issued to Osborn on August 21,
1990 and April 23, 1991, respectively.Generally when sanitary napkins are provided with flaps, the
flaps extend laterally from a central absorbent means and are
intended to be folded around the edges of the wearer's panties in
the crotch region. Thus, the flaps are disposed between the edges
of the wearer's panties in the crotch region and the wearer's
thighs. Commonly, the flaps are provided with an attachment means
for either affixing the naps to the underside of the wearer's
panties or to the opposing flap. The flaps are particularly
effective for preventing exudates from soiling the edges of the
wearer's panties.Sanitary napkins having flaps of various types are disclosed
in U.S. Patent 4,687,478, entitled "Shaped Sanitary Napkin With
Flaps", which issued to Van Tilburg on August 18, 1987; U.S.
Patent 4,608,047, entitled "Sanitary Napkin Attachment Means",
which issued to Mattingly on August 26, 1986; U.S. Patent
4,589,876, entitled "Sanitary Napkin", which issued to Van Tilburg
on May 20, 1986 and its Reexamination Patent No. B1 4,589,876,
Certificate of Reexamination issued April 27, l993; U.S. Patent
4,285,343, entitled "Sanitary Napkin", which issued to McNair on
August 25, 1981; U.S. Patent 3,397,697, entitled "Disposable
Sanitary Shield For Undergarments", which issued to Rickard on
August 20, 1968; and, U.S. Patent 2,787,271, entitled "Sanitary
Napkin", which issued to Clark on April 2, 1957.While sanitary

An absorbent article (20) having a longitudinal dimension

extending in a longitudinal direction and a transverse dimension
extending in a transverse direction a longitudinal centerline (L), and

a transverse centerline (T), said absorbent article (20) comprising a
main body portion (21 ) comprising an absorbent core (42), said main

body portion (21) having a body-facing side (20A), a garment-facing
side (20B), and a pair of longitudinal side edges (22), an

undergarment covering component (100),

comprising a pair of side Wrapping elements (52) that extend
laterally outward beyond the longitudinal side edges (22) of said

main body portion (21) and at least a portion of said undergarment
covering component ( 100) is extensible generally in the longitudinal

direction,
said absorbent article (20) characterized in that,
said undergarment covering component (100) being joined to the
garment-facing side (20B) of said main body portion (21) inboard of

the longitudinal side edges (22) of said main body portion (21) at
affixation points and being otherwise unattached to said main body

portion laterally outboard of at leapt some of said affixation points,
said side wrapping elements (52) extend laterally outward beyond
the longitudinal side edge (22) a distance of less than one-half the

width of said main body portion (21) to distal edges (53), and
said undergarment covering component (100) is preferably also
extensible generally in the transverse direction between said

affixation points and said distal edges (53) of said side wrapping
elements (52).
The absorbent article (20) of Claim 1 wherein said extensible
portion of said undergarment covering component (100) is extensible

greater than or equal to 5 % and less than 50 %, and more preferably
between 10 % and 40 %, under forces of between 50 grams and 1,500

grams.
The absorbent article (20) of Claims 1 or 2 wherein said
undergarment covering component (100) has at least one additional

characteristic selected from the group consisting of:

(a) at least one extensible portion with a return force of less
than or equal to 100 grams, more preferably less than or equal 

to 50 grams, and most preferably less than or equal to 25
grams;
(b) at least one extensible portion having a set point at greater
than or equal to 10 % strain; more preferably greater than or

equal to 20 % strain;
(c) side wrapping elements (52) each having a distal edge (53)
and a resistance to edge compression of greater than or equal

to 5 grams more preferably greater than or equal to 10 grams;
(d) side wrapping elements (52) having a fold retention of less
than or equal to 90°; mole preferably less than or equal to 20°;
(e) side wrapping elements (52) comprise a material having
