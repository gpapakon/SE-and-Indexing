<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions useful
for regulating biochemical and cellular damage resulting from
free radical reactions in living persons.This invention further relates to topical compositions
useful for protecting the skin from the harmful effects of
ultraviolet irradiation, such as sunburn and sun-induced
premature aging of the skin.The damaging effects of sunlight on skin are well documented.
Much damage is due to routine day-to-day activities in
the sunlight.The major short term hazard of prolonged exposure to
sunlight is erythema (i.e., sunburn). The 290 to 320 nanometer
wavelength ultraviolet radiation range, designated as the "UVB"
wavelength range, tends to be the primary cause of erythema. The
320 to 400 nanometer wavelength ultraviolet radiation range,
designated as the "UVA" wavelength range, also produces erythema.In addition to the short term hazard of erythema, there are
also long term hazards associated with UV radiation exposure.
One of these long term hazards is malignant changes in the skin
surface. Numerous epidemiologic studies demonstrate a strong
relationship between sunlight exposure and human skin cancer.
Another long term hazard of ultraviolet radiation is premature
aging of the skin. This condition is characterized by wrinkling
and yellowing of the skin, along with other physical changes such
as cracking, telangiectasis (spider vessels), solar keratoses
(growths), ecchymoses (subcutaneous hemorrhagic lesions), and
loss of elasticity (sagging). The adverse effects associated
with exposure to UVA and UVB wavelength radiation are more fully
discussed in DeSimone, "Sunscreen and Suntan Products", Handbook
of Nonprescription Drugs, 7th Ed, Chapter 26, pp. 499-511 
(American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, D.C.; 1982);
Grove and Forbes, "A Method for Evaluating the Photoprotection
Action of Sunscreen Agents Against UV-A Radiation", International
Journal of Cosmetic Science, 4, pp. 15-24 (1982); and U.S. Patent
4,387,089, DePolo, issued June 7, 1983. Hence, although the
immediate effects of ultraviolet radiation may be cosmetically
and socially gratifying, the long-term hazards are cumulative and
potentially serious.Sunblock agents are commercially available to protect the
skin from UV radiation. These agents scatter or reflect
ultraviolet radiation. Examples include titanium dioxide and
zinc oxide. However, these agents are very susceptible to
rub-off or wear-off resulting in little or no protection.The most common agents for sun protection are
