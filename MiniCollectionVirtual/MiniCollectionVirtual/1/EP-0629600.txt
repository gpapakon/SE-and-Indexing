<ABSTRACT>
A first alkanol having 1 to 3 C atoms can be separated off by membrane permeation from other organic compounds having a higher number of carbon atoms selected from the group comprising other alcohols, polyalcohols, ethers, oxo compounds, esters of carboxylic acids and of carbonic acid, aliphatic halides, amines, amides, hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids and nitriles which always have at least 1 C atom more than the first alkanol, in the case of aliphatic halides, halogen substituents being counted as further C atoms, if a water content of 1 to 30% by weight, preferably 5 to 15% by weight, based on the amount of mixture and water, is maintained.
