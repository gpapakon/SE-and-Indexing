<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (20) for delivering a newly formed floating glass sheet from a molten metal bath container (22) includes a topside support device (45) located adjacent the delivery end of the bath container and having a downwardly facing surface (80) with a first set of openings (82) through which a vacuum is drawn and a second set of openings (84) through which pressurized gas is supplied to support the glass sheet strip upon delivery from the molten metal bath (24). The bath container (22) with which the apparatus is disclosed as being used has a linear induction motor (24) that permits horizontal delivery without bath overflowing. The apparatus (20) also includes a gas support (34) and a drive roll (42) that cooperate with each other. The gas support (34) supports the horizontally delivered glass sheet strip by upwardly directed pressurized gas delivered between lateral edge portions (38) of the strip at a location immediately adjacent the bath container (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for
delivering a newly formed floating glass sheet strip
from a molten metal bath within a bath container to an
annealing lehr where the strip is annealed.Glass sheet strip forming has previously been
done by both vertical and horizontal processing. In the
vertical method such as disclosed by United States
Patents 1,828,832 Drake and 3,137,556 Badger et al, a
molten glass strip is pulled upwardly and then turned
approximately 90° over a horizontally extending roll so
as to be delivered horizontally. In the horizontal
method, a glass sheet strip is floated on a molten metal
bath, normally tin, prior to movement upwardly out of
the bath for delivery therefrom on rolls in a horizontal
direction as disclosed by United States Patent 3,885,943
Chui and 3,930,825 Chui. With both the vertical and
horizontal glass sheet strip forming processes, it is
thus necessary for the glass sheet strip to pass over a
roll in its hot condition just after forming which is a
disadvantage because the roll thus engages the hot glass
when it is relatively soft and thereby reduces its
optical quality and mechanical strength. More
specifically, the vertical process requires the glass to
pass over a roll in order to turn 90° for horizontal
delivery as mentioned above, and the horizontal process
requires the glass sheet to be bent upwardly by a roll
so as to be delivered above an adjacent wall of the
molten metal bath which is necessary in order to prevent 
the molten metal bath from spilling out adjacent the
edge of the bath where the hot glass sheet strip is
delivered. In order to provide better quality glass,
the horizontally float glass processing as disclosed by
United States Patents 4,081,260 Glikman et al and
4,548,636 Nomaki et al have utilized linear induction
motors that exert an electromagnetic induction to the
molten metal of the bath adjacent the edge thereof so
that the glass sheet strip can remain horizontal
adjacent the extremity of the bath without the molten
metal spilling out of the bath container. In the
4,081,260 Glikman et al patent, the hot glass sheet
strip is bent slightly upwardly adjacent the extremity
of the bath container where inductors are located and is
then supported by a device having nozzles for forming a
gas cushion that delivers the hot glass sheet strip to
an annealing kiln or lehr. In the 4,548,636 Nomaki et
al patent, the side walls of the bath container are
disclosed as being made of an electrically conductive
material so as to maintain a uniform

A glass sheet forming system (10)
including a bath container (22) for containing a molten

metal bath (24) on which a newly formed glass sheet
strip (G) is floated, and apparatus (20) for delivering

the newly formed glass sheet strip (G) from the bath
container (24),

   characterized in that the apparatus (20) comprises

   a topside support device (45) located above
the molten metal bath (24) and having a downwardly

facing surface (80) including a first set of openings
(82) through which a vacuum is drawn to support the

glass sheet strip (G), and the downwardly facing surface
(80) of the topside support device (45) having a second

set of openings (84) through which pressurized gas is
supplied to space the glass sheet strip (G) from the

downwardly facing surface (80) such that the vacuum
drawn and pressurized gas cooperatively support the

glass sheet strip (G) without direct contact therewith
for delivery from the molten metal bath (24).
A system (10) as in claim 1 wherein the
bath container (22) includes a linear induction motor

(26) that permits the glass sheet strip (G) to move
horizontally from the molten metal bath (24) without the

bath overflowing the bath container (22).
A system (10) as in claim 1 further
including a gas support (34) for supporting the

horizontally delivered glass sheet strip (G) by upwardly
directed pressurized gas delivered between lateral edge

portions (38) of the strip (G) at a location immediately
adjacent the bath container (22). 
A system (10) as in claim 3 wherein the
bath container (22) includes an upper housing (32) that

encloses the molten metal bath (24) which is tin, the
gas support (34) including a first manifold (46) having

an inert gas supply (48) for supplying an upwardly
directed inert gas that supports the glass sheet strip

(G) adjacent the bath container (24) while supplying
inert gas to the upper housing (32) of the bath

container (22) in order to prevent forming of tin
