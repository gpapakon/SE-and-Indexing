<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display assembly (10, 18, 22) for use 
with a reflective type overhead projector (28) includes a 

liquid crystal display (10). The liquid crystal display 
includes a Fresnel reflector with 

variable width grooves (24) which reduce double 
imaging which usually occurs with reflective type overhead 

projectors (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to overhead 
projectors, particularly those of the reflective type. Recently several types of liquid crystal 
displays (LCD) for use on transmissive stage overhead 
projectors have become commercially available, and have 
become quite useful for the projection of computer 
generated text and graphic information. These transmissive 
displays are preferably of the high contrast supertwist 
type, multiplex addressed, with a typical 640 pixel 
horizontal by 200 pixel vertical resolution. The display 
area is usually rectangular, and is usually used in the 
horizontal or landscape mode. These displays are not 
directly usable with the more portable type of overhead 
projectors, the reflective stage type such as that 
described in U.S. patent no. 3,293,982 issued to 
Appeldorn. Although the LCD panel could be set directly on 
the reflective stage and an image produced, the large 
vertical separation between the LCD panel and the 
reflective stage of the overhead projector results in 
severe double imaging in the projected image. Several 
attempts have been made to reduce the separation of the 
LCD panel and the reflector for use on a reflective 
overhead projector. For example, as described in W.C. 
Connolly, "Projected Liquid Crystal Computer Displays", 
The Physics Teacher, Sept. 1985, pp. 382-3, a liquid 
crystal computer display is used in reflective overhead  
 
projection by the addition of a second-surface Fresnel 
reflector underneath the display. The use of a second-surface 
Fresnel reflector produces a double imaging effect 
of the projected LCD image plane. U.S. Patent No. 4,652,101 and U.K. Patent 
Application No. 2,196,165 describe an LCD panel for use in 
reflective overhead projection, the image being produced by 
placing a second-surface Fresnel reflector directly beneath 
the LCD panel. In these documents, the LCD image plane-to-Fresnel 
reflector distance is decreased by incorporating 
the Fresnel lens as a permanent component of the LCD panel. 
Thus, custom-built LCD panels are required and less 
expensive, commercially available standard LCD panel 
displays cannot be used. Another prior art document DE-U-8,705,103 discloses an 
overhead projector comprising a base supporting a Fresnel 
reflector, a light source suspended above the Fresnel 
reflector for directing light to the reflector, a 
projection lens suspended above the reflector and arranged 
to receive light reflected from the reflector and to direct 
the light to an image plane. The projector further

A liquid crystal display assembly (10, 18, 22) for use 
with a reflective type overhead projector (28) comprising: 

   a liquid crystal display (10) including two 
transparent glass plates (14, 16) between which is disposed 

a liquid crystal material (12); characterised by 
   a variable groove width Fresnel reflector (22) 

disposed adjacent one of said liquid crystal glass plates 
(14, 16) wherein the widths of the grooves (24) of the 

reflective surface of said Fresnel reflector (22) 
progressively decrease outwardly from the centre (26) of 

said Fresnel reflector (22) to minimise the distance 
between said liquid crystal imaging material (12) and said 

reflective surface to reduce double imaging of an image 
projected by said overhead projector (28). 
A liquid crystal display assembly (10, 18, 22) 
according to claim 1 wherein the widths of said groove (24) 

of said Fresnel reflector (22) decrease linearly from the 
centre (26) of said Fresnel reflector (22). 
An overhead projector (28) comprising: 
   a base supporting a reflective stage (32); 

   a light source (34) suspended above said stage (32) 
for directing light to said stage (32); 

   a projection lens (30) suspended above said stage (32) 
for receiving light reflected from said stage (32) and 

directing said light to an image plane; 
   a liquid crystal display (10) disposed on said stage 

(32) and including two transparent glass plates (14, 16) 
between which is disposed a liquid crystal imaging material 

(12); and 
   a variable groove width Fresnel reflector (22) 

disposed between said stage (32) and said liquid crystal 
display (10) adjacent one of said liquid crystal glass 

plates (14, 16) wherein the widths of the grooves (24) of 
the reflective surface of said Fresnel reflector (22) 

 
progressively decrease outwardly from the center (26) of 

said Fresnel reflector (22) to minimize the distance 
between said liquid crystal imaging material (12) and said 

reflective surface (32) to reduce double imaging of an 
image projected by said overhead projector (28). 
An overhead projector (28) according to claim 3 
wherein said grooves (24) of said Fresnel reflector (22) 

decrease linearly from the center (26) of said Fresnel 
reflector (22).
