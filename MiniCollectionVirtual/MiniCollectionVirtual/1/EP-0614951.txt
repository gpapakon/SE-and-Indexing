<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the production of aqueous coating compositions having a matchable colour and a low solvent content. The coating compositions are particularly suitable for the finishing of motor vehicles and the coating of automotive components. The process comprises preparing and, if desired, storing, separately from one another, in each case one reservoir of     - at least one stable colour module A) containing one or more colour pigments and/or fillers, one or more anionically stabilised water-thinnable paste resins based on polyurethane, at least 20% by weight of water, and - optionally - one or more water-thinnable anionically and/or nonanionically stabilised binders, one or more organic solvents and/or additives which are conventional in coatings, and   - at least one stable binder module B) containing one or more water-thinnable anionically and/or nonanionically stabilised binders, water, if desired one or more solvents, and if desired one or more crosslinking agents and/or one or more additives which are conventional in coatings, and further comprises mixing together, on demand, the quantities of the prepared modules A) and B) which are required in each case to obtain a desired colour.
