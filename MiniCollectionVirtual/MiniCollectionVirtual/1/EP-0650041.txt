<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of Hall 
effect device position sensing, and specifically to 
precision sensing by a Hall effect sensor of pressure 
differentials in hostile environments such as may be found 
in industrial or combustion processes. Pressure transducers may be designed to sense the pressure 
of a single medium against a standard, such as atmospheric 
pressure or vacuum, or may alternatively be designed to 
measure the differential pressure between two fluids. 
Force sensing devices may also commonly be adapted to 
measure a single pressure, typically through a pressure-to-force 
translational member. Pressure measurement is typically achieved by the use of a 
planar and yet flexible plate or membrane, i.e. a diaphragm, 
which is caused to flex in proportion to the amount of 
force per unit area of the diaphragm, or a pressure 
differential from one surface of the diaphragm to the 
opposite surface. Common materials for the diaphragm 
include alumina or other ceramics, polyimides, polytetrafluoroethylenes 
or other polymers, micromachined silicon, 
and metal sheet or foil. Deflection of the diaphragm may 
be measured with strain sensitive resistors, piezoelectric 
devices, force sensitive resistors, or by capacitive gap 
measurements, or other various known position detecting 
means. When these sensors are to be subjected to hostile 
environments such as may be found in industrial processes  
 
or in effluent from hydrocarbon combustion processes, the 
choice of materials from which to form a suitable sensor 
becomes very restricted. Silicon and most metallic 
sensors are sensitive to corrosive combustion products. 
Polymer materials are temperature sensitive and therefore 
restricted to processes which closely follow typical room 
temperatures. Selectively plating or coating easily corroded materials 
has been considered, though not deemed suitable for 
applications of wide temperature extremes and strongly 
corrosive chemical exposure. This is due to the 
probability of microdefects which are commonly present 
after typical coating operations and after thermal cycling. 
These defects act as a starting point for corrosion which 
very quickly destroys the protective coatings. The need for long term precision and reliability may 
further dictate the choice of materials. Polymer 
materials are not well suited to maintaining a precise 
dimension when exposed to long term forces. This effect 
is commonly referred to as material creep or cold flow, 
and occurs in all known
