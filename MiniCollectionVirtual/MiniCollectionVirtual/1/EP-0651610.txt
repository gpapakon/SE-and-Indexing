<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the use, in the production of process cheese and cheese preparations, of stabilized milk protein, or casein, in the form of a dry powder containing 0.5 to 20 % of phosphate and/or citrate and with a protein content of over 30 % relative to the dry product. The invention also concerns methods of manufacturing such process cheese and cheese preparations.

<CLAIMS>
Use of whey protein for the production of processed 
cheese, characterised in that one uses stabilised whey 

protein powders which are obtained in that one mixes 
protein-enriched whey concentrate with 0.5 - 20% of 

phosphate and/or citrate referred to the amount of 
protein, heats to a temperature of 35 - 150°C, 

preferably of 50 - 100 ° C, and subsequently dries, 
whereby the amount of protein is to amount to over 30% 

of the dry substance and the whey protein powder is 
added to the cheese mass in amounts of up to 20, 

preferably 5 - 10 wt.%. 
Use of a whey protein powder according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it contains 1 to 5% of phosphate 

or citrate. 
Use of a whey protein powder according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that it has an amount of protein 

of 50 to 96%. 
Use of a whey protein powder according to claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that there are contained 

0 - 60% lactose and 0 to 10% of inorganic and organic 
salts from the whey. 
Use of a whey protein powder according to claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the powder still contains 

2 to 7% of water. 
Use of a whey protein powder according to claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that sweet or acidic whey is 

adjusted by ultrafiltration, with partial removal of 
water, lactose and dissolved salts, to protein contents 

of 3 to 30% in the solution and protein contents in the 
dry mass of 30 to 96% before the phosphate or citrate 

is added. 
Process for the production of processed cheese 
with use of whey protein powder according to claims  

 
1 to 6, wherein one mixes cheese, fat, processing salts, 

water and other usual components with up to 20, preferably 
5 - 10 wt.% of the whey protein powder, melts the 

mixture, forms the melt mass and cools.
