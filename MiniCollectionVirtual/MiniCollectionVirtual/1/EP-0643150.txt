<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing a surface for the application 
of a non-stick coating comprises thermally spraying a 

stainless steel alloy which contains at most 6.0% 
aluminium, and which is substantially nickel free. 

Preferably the chromium content of the alloy is at most 
23.5%. This method is particularly useful for cooking 

utensils.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field 
of arc spraying or flame spraying, typically both referred 
to as thermal spraying and specifically to thermal spraying 
an intermediate layer of material on stainless steel or 
aluminium cooking vessels in order to prepare the cooking 
surface of the cooking vessel for receiving a non-stick 
coating layer. Application of non-stick coatings to cooking vessels 
is well known. Adhesion of the non-stick coating (e.g. 
non-stick coatings such as the TEFLON (trade mark) non-stick 
coating) layer applied to a substrate metal is 
improved by first flame spraying metal droplets onto the 
substrate layer to give a rough surface for the non-stick 
coating to adhere to. However, this coating can break 
down typically due to corrosion between the substrate metal 
of the cooking vessel and the thermal sprayed intermediate 
layer (galvanic corrosion) or as the result of cooking high 
acid content food (e.g. stewed tomatoes) at relatively high 
cooking temperatures, i.e. electrolytic corrosion. Accordingly, metals that are subject to corrosion in 
combination with a thermally sprayed intermediate layer, 
like a stainless steel alloy of a specific composition, 
are considered not suitable intermediate layers for this 
technique because of the risk of corrosion, e.g. with 
aluminium pans there is the potential for white rust 
corrosion, i.e. the formation of aluminium oxides within 
the coating layers. Corrosion causes blistering of the 
non-stick surface and causes the non-stick surface to pull 
away from the cooking vessel or utensil. According to this invention, a method of preparing a 
surface for application of a non-stick coating comprises 
thermally spraying the surface with a substantially nickel 
free stainless steel alloy containing at most 6% aluminium.  Preferably, the stainless steel alloy further 
contains at most 23.5% chromium. Thus the present invention is a method involving the 
application of a material to substrates, such as aluminium 
and stainless steel for cooking vessels, that material 
having previously been thought to be unacceptable for use 
in such a thermal spraying technique. The present invention provides a unique and simple 
method for application of a thermally sprayed layer to a 
substrate of a cooking vessel for formation of an 
intermediate layer to improve adhesion of a non-stick 
coating to the cooking utensil without creating galvanic or 
electrolytic corrosion. No prior art either teaches or discloses this 
invention. For
