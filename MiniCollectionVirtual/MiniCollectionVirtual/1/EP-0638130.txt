<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for mixing a particulate substance, which may be in chopped or short fibre form, with a matrix metal comprises a container (11) for molten metal (10) having an aperture (12) through which a stream of the metal can fall, a feed motor (20) for feeding the particulate substance into the metal stream, and one or more downwardly inclined nozzles (23) through which jets of atomizing gas are directed on to the combined flow of metal and particulate substance. The feed motor comprising a horizontal ring (20a) which extends about and is coaxial with the molten metal stream, and which has a radial vibration imparted to it so as to form a node on the axis of the ring. The upper surface of the ring may be horizontal or may be inclined downwardly towards the axis and may have annular grooves of ratchet tooth section with the steeper part of the section facing towards the axis. The particulate substance is placed on the upper surface of the ring (20) and is caused to move into engagement with the molten metal stream by the radial vibration of the ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to motors the motor effect of 
which can be employed in two different ways giving it an 
important but by no means exclusive application in apparatus for 
manufacturing metal matrix composite materials, i.e. metals 
incorporating particulate substances. The term "particulate 
substances" is used herein to include substances in chopped or 
short fibre form in addition to powdered and granular substances. Very fine powders are difficult to make flow in a 
controlled manner and one means of producing a flow is to cause 
the material to vibrate. US-A-3941284 discloses apparatus for 
discharging particulate material from a hopper which includes a 
conical material support member having a discharge opening, the 
support member being vibrated flexurally at a resonant frequency 
to pass particulate material under gravity through the discharge 
opening. The present invention is based on the discovery that 
if a ring disposed substantially horizontally is caused to 
vibrate radially, preferably at its natural frequency, a flowable 
substance deposited on the upper surface of the ring moves to the 
central aperture of the ring and further, that material tends 
during its fall through the ring to move then towards the axis 
of the ring under the radial compressing force of gas present in 
the hole and vibrating at the same frequency as the ring. According to this invention there is provided a motor 
comprising a ring arranged with its axis in an up and down 
direction, and having its upper surface either disposed 
substantially horizontally or with a downward inclination towards 
the axis of the ring, and means for imparting radial vibration 
to the ring so to form a node on the axis of the ring. Where the motor is used as a feed motor for a 
particulate substance, means is provided for directing the 
substance on to the upper surface of the ring. A hopper for the material may conveniently have its 
lower end secured to the ring in a manner to vibrate with the 
ring.  
 The upper surface of the ring may 
advantageously be inclined towards the axis of the ring 
and may be smooth or formed with concentric grooves or 
a spiral groove of saw-tooth section. In one 
construction the groove or grooves are of ratchet-tooth 
section with the steeper face of the section facing 
towards the axis of the ring. A useful way of producing metal matrix 
composites is to atomize the molten matrix metal by gas 
or other means and introduce into the atomized spray 
the second phase which can be in the form of

A feed motor for a particulate substance, comprising a ring 
arranged with its axis in an up and down direction, means 

for imparting radial vibration to the ring so to form a 
node on the axis of the ring, the ring having an upper 

surface which is disposed substantially horizontally or 
with a downward inclination towards the axis of the ring, 

and means for directing the substance on to the upper 
surface of the ring. 
A motor as claimed in claim 1, wherein the ring and the 
means for imparting radial vibration to the ring are 

adapted so that the ring is vibrated at its natural or 
resonant frequency. 
A motor as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the ring is 
made from stainless steel. 
A motor as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the 
upper surface of the ring is inclined downward towards the 

axis of the ring and is formed with a series of coaxial 
grooves or a spiral groove and/or wherein the groove or 

grooves are of saw-tooth section and/or wherein the groove 
or grooves are of ratchet-tooth section with the steeper 

face of the section facing towards the axis of the ring. 
A motor as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the 
means for directing the substance on to the upper surface 

of the ring comprises a hopper having its lower end secured 
to the ring (such as the outer edge of the ring) in a 

manner to partake of the vibration of the ring. 
A motor as claimed in claim 5, wherein a valve is provided 
for controlling the flow of material from the hopper on to 

the upper surface of the ring.  
 
Apparatus for mixing a particulate substance with a matrix 
metal, said apparatus comprising, for the addition of the 

particulate substance a motor as claimed in any one of 
claims 1 to 6, means for directing a stream of the metal in 

molten form axially downward through the ring, and means 
for directing one or more downwardly inclined jets of 

atomizing gas on to the combined flow of molten metal and 
particulate material. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, wherein the ring 
incorporates a ring of nozzles for directing said jets of 

atomizing gas (said nozzles being typically in 
communication with annular plenum chamber to which 

atomizing gas under pressure is supplied); and/or wherein 
an annular member disposed closely below and coaxially with 

the ring is provided with a ring of nozzles for directing 
said jets of atomizing gas. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 or 8, wherein the ring
