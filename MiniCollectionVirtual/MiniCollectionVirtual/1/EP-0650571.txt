<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tangential firing systems for use with
pulverized solid fuel-fired furnaces, and more specifically, to an integrated low
NOx tangential firing system, which is applicable to a wide range of solid fuels
and which when employed with a pulverized solid fuel-fired furnace is
capable of limiting NOx emissions therefrom to levels consistent with alternate
solid fuel-based power generation technologies.Pulverized solid fuel has been successfully burned in suspension
in furnaces by tangential firing methods for a long time. The tangential firing
technique involves introducing the pulverized solid fuel and air into a furnace
from the four corners thereof so that the pulverized solid fuel and air are
directed tangent to an imaginary circle in the center of the furnace. This type
of firing has many advantages, among them being good mixing of the
pulverized solid fuel and the air, stable flame conditions, and long residence
time of the combustion gases in the furnaces.Recently though, more and more emphasis has been placed on
the minimization as much as possible of air pollution. In this connection, with
reference in particular to the matter of NOx control it is known that oxides of
nitrogen are created during fossil fuel combustion primarily by two separate
mechanisms which have been identified to be thermal NOx and fuel NOx.
Thermal NOx results from the thermal fixation of molecular nitrogen and
oxygen in the combustion air. The rate of formation of thermal NOx is 
extremely sensitive to local flame temperature and somewhat less so to local
concentration of oxygen. Virtually all thermal NOx is formed at the region of
the flame which is at the highest temperature. The thermal NOx concentration
is subsequently "frozen" at the level prevailing in the high temperature region
by the thermal quenching of the combustion gases. The flue gas thermal NOx
concentrations are, therefore, between the equilibrium level characteristic of
the peak flame temperature and the equilibrium level at the flue gas
temperature.On the other hand, fuel NOx derives from the oxidation of
organically bound nitrogen in certain fossil fuels such as coal and heavy oil.
The formation rate of fuel NOx is strongly affected by the rate of mixing of the
fossil fuel and air stream in general, and by the local oxygen concentration in
particular. However, the flue gas NOx concentration due to fuel nitrogen is
typically only a fraction, e.g., 20 to 60 percent, of the level which would result
from complete oxidation of all

a. providing (62) a supply of pulverized solid fuel of a

furnace (10) such that the stoichiometry is between 0.7 and 0.9 in
a second combustion zone of the burner region (14) of the
