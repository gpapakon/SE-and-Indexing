<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses dyeing agents which 
are excellent in visual recognition of discernible or 

tangible components in a sample and cause no coagulation 
of proteins, sugars 
or glycoproteins dissolved in the 
sample, and an apparatus for image analysis of flow type 

stain particles in which by using such dyeing agents, 
particles of discernible components suspended in a flowing 

sample can be detected so that images of the particles 
can be efficiently photographed and the discernible 

components can thus be analyzed by image processing of 
the thus obtained image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dyeing agents
for biological stain of red blood cells, white blood
cells, epithelial cells or the like. In particular, the
present invention relates to dyeing agents for bio
samples like urine, containing extracellular tangible
components such as crystals or casts; these components
are difficultly discernible from dye precipitates,
urinary components deposited or coagulated, impurities
such as dusts, etc. which may be contained in a same
biological sample, in addition to the aforesaid cellular
components. The present invention also relates to a
method for preparing such dyeing agents and to use
thereof.The description hereinafter further describes an
apparatus for particle image analysis in which images of
particles suspended in flowing fluids are photographed
and images of the particles are analyzed, and in
particular, to an apparatus for analysis of particle
images which is suitable to know the kind of cells or
particles in blood or urine, or culture cells, etc. and
the life or death of these cells. For classification and analysis of cells in
blood or cells and particles in urine which have been
employed in the prior art, a specimen is put on a slide
glass and observed microscopically. In the case of
urine having a low density of particles therein, a
urinary sample is previously centrifuged with a
centrifuging machine and the thus concentrated sample is
microscopically observed. These operations for
observation and inspection have been automated using an
apparatus through the steps of applying a sample such as
blood onto a slide glass, setting the slide glass in a
microscope, automatically scanning a stage of the
microscope to stop it at the position where particles
are present, taking a picture of still images of the
particles, and classifying the particles in the sample
using characteristic extraction and pattern recognition
techniques by image processing. However, such a process
encounters problems that it takes time for preparing a
sample and furthermore, additional operations are
necessary for locating particles while mechanically
moving the microscope stage and transferring the
particles to an appropriate zone for image input. Thus,
a time period for analysis is prolonged and a mechanism
of apparatus becomes complicated.Flow cytometry for optically analyzing an
analyte suspended in a fluid sample while flowing the
sample in a flow cell is known. In flow cytometry, it 
is unnecessary to prepare any smear and instead, a
fluorescent or scattering intensity of each

<CLAIMS>
A dyeing agent for staining a biological
sample, which comprises at least two dyes for staining

cell and tissue and, a pH buffer, said dye(s) being
nonpolar molecular dye(s) which, upon blending, cause no

agglutination or sedimentation and which do not precipitate
or agglutinate sugars, proteins or glycoproteins

dissolved in said biological sample, and which
stain at least two objects for staining, to different

degrees in color hue or in dyeing strength depending on
the respective objects, and which stain, in the case of

the same object for staining, the respective components
constituting the object to different degrees in color

hue or in dyeing strength,
wherein

said dye(s) are an azo dye and a xanthene dye used for
supravital staining,

wherein
said azo dye is

Evans Blue, and
said xanthene dye is selected from the group consisting

of Erythrosine, Phloxine and Eosin, or wherein said azo dye is Trypan
Blue and said xanthene dye is Erythrosine.
A dyeing agent according to claim 1, wherein
said pH buffer is selected from the group consisting of 

a phosphate buffer, a succinate buffer and a tris-acid
buffer.
A dyeing agent according to claim 2, which
further contains an antibacterial agent

being selected from the group
consisting of sodium azide, para-hydroxyphenylacetic

acid, dehydroacetic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid.
A dyeing agent obtained by mixing 1 volume of
about 0.2 to 10.0 x 10-2 mol/l of Evans Blue or Trypan

Blue with about 0.5 to 2.0 volumes of about 0.2 to 10.0
x 10-2 mol/l of Erythrosine; optionally mixing wi
th the
mixture one member selected from the group consisting of

sodium azide, para-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, dehydroacetic
acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in a

concentration of 0.01 to 1.0%; and adjusting a pH of the
system to 5.7 to 7.9 using 1/30 to 1/5 mols/l of a

solvent selected from the group consisting of a
phosphate buffer, a succinate buffer and a tris-acid

buffer. 
A method for staining discernible urinary
sediments in urine which comprises using a dyeing agent

according to claim 3.
