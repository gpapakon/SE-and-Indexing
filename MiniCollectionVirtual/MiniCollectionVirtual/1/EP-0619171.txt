<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for decorating plastic 
elements for apparatuses of any kind, comprising the steps of: 


realizing a plurality of decorations on a transparent film 
support using a ink able to withstand to the temperatures that are reached 

in the successive steps, and with any molding technology; 
cutting said support bearing the decorations in single units; 
introducing said single unit within the mold with the 
decorated face toward the injection zone of the molding material; and 
injecting the molding plastic material in order to obtain the 
decorated element; 
   the decoration being comprised between the transparent film 
support and the solidified injected material. 
The products obtained by the above described process are 
also within the scope of the present invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for decorating 
plastic elements for apparatuses of any kind and decorated elements thus 
obtained. More particularly, the invention relates to a process that allows 
to realize decorated elements by very simple operations and with very low 
costs, although a plurality of colours is used for the decoration. As it is well known, the plastic surfaces can be decorated using 
different technologies, among which the spray painting or other kind of 
painting, by which a layer of paint is laid down on the surface of the 
element to be decorated. Another technique used is the silk-screen process, consisting 
in selectively lay down the colour(s) by a suitably pre-drilled frame. In the tampon off-set printing technique, the ink is transferred 
on the surface to be decorated by an inked silicone rubber pad. It allows 
to reach also zones that cannot be reached by the silk-screen process. Another known technique is the hot-stamping, wherein the 
images are previously realized on a plastic film, the support, and are 
made adhesive, so that by a roll or a hammer operated by a press, and 
with the heat interaction, they are attacked to the surface to be decorated 
and separated by the support. Also in the so called in-mold technique a sheet similar to the 
one used for the hot-stamping is employed. The sheet is introduced within 
the mold and the plastic is injected adhering the images to the injected 
material and separating them from the support. Each of the above mentioned techniques provides that the 
image is laid down on the surface of the plastic element, so that the 
decoration is exposed to the outer environment, with the consequent 
drawbacks. In fact, in this way the decoration is subject to scratches, dirt, 
wear, can be contacted by corrosive substances or solvents, and 
consequently its useful life is remarkably reduced with respect to the 
necessities. Another problem that is particularly important in this specific 
field concerns the fact that the realization of decorations comprising many  
 
colours is expensive, and the costs increase with any addition of a new 
colour. It can be said that each passage of a colour, using the known 
technologies, has a cost comparable to the cost of the plastic element in 
case the decoration occupies the whole surface. The hot-stamping and in-mold technologies, by which a 
decoration with more than one colour could be obtained, however present 
difficulties to realize this since they do not confere to the product strength
