<ABSTRACT>
A pearlescent pigment comprising micaceous 
particles having an adherent layer of rutile titanium 

dioxide thereon is prepared by effecting the deposition 
of hydrous titanium dioxide on the micaceous particles in 

the presence of iron and calcium, magnesium and/or zinc 
ions without the use of tin.

<DESCRIPTION>
Nacreous or pearlescent pigments which are titanium
dioxide coatings on mica substrates are well known.Such pearlescent pigments are for example described
in the EP-0 211 351 A2, EP-0 075 755 A2 or EP-0 082 986 A1.These pigments exhibit pearl-like and/or iridescent
effects from their reflection and transmission of light. The
titanium dioxide coating is actually transparent to light. However,
because the coatings are extremely smooth and have a high
index of refraction, they follow the laws of thin films. Part
of the light which strikes each platelet is reflected and part
transmitted to lower platelets where multiple reflections can
occur. These multiple reflections from lower layers give a
sense of depth or sheen which simulates the real pearl. Also,
if the thickness of the titanium dioxide layer is controlled,
interference of light occurs and the platelets act as optical
filters separating light into two components. A color is seen
by reflection and a complementary color by transmission.Pearlescent pigments are used extensively in a
variety of applications including plastic incorporation, automotive
coatings and in cosmetics. The pearlescent pigments
which are titanium dioxide coated on a mica substrate have a
high index of refraction. The pigments are normally dispersed
in mediums such as paint films, or nail enemal films,
which, when fully cured, have an index of refraction of about
1.5. The index of refraction of the pearlescent pigment must
therefore be considerably 
higher than 1.5 if reflectivity of light is to occur.
This high index of refraction is provided by the titanium
dioxide layer whose index can vary between 2.3 and 2.5.
The mica substrate on which the titanium dioxide is
coated has an index about 1.5 and therefore, does not
take part in any reflectivity when incorporated in a
film. The rutile form of titanium dioxide has a higher
index than the anatase form and as a result, the rutile
modification will have greater reflectivity than the
anatase form. Therefore, the rutile modification of
titanium dioxide in a pearlescent pigment is more
desirable than the anatase modification.There are many other reasons for preferring the
rutile modification. The rutile modification is more
stable in outdoor weathering than is the anatase
modification. The rutile modification of a titanium
dioxide coated mica results in a product which has better
luster and reflectivity, better color and color
homogeneity and also contains fewer small particles. In
the processing stage during the formation of the
