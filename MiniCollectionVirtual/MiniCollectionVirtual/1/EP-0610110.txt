<ABSTRACT>
A mouth-to-mouth resuscitator for use by a rescuer in order to 
force air into a victim while avoiding direct mouth-to-mouth contact 

between the rescuer and the victim is provided. The device comprises a 
vertically extending hollow body (10) having a first, top (12) and a second, 

bottom (14) portions, a first portion (12) has a mouth piece at its upper end 
and has a substantially cross-sectional shape, and the second portion (14) 

has an air outlet at its lower end and is adapted for insertion into the victim's 
mouth. The hollow body (10) has a one-way valve assembly (16) between 

the first (12) and the second (14) portions which permits air passage only 
from the direction of the first portion (12) into the second portion (14). The 

above assembly (16) has a rigid valve seat (24) which has a central portion 
which allows air passage and a flexible valve member (26) below the valve 

seat (24) which is upwardly biased against the valve seat (24). The device 
further comprises a pliable sheet (18) which extends laterally from around 

the hollow body (10), at about the zone thereof which is between the first 
(12) and second (14) portions of the hollow body (10) of the sheet (18), 

separated between the mouth area of the victim and the mouth of the 
rescuer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a mouth to mouth resuscitator for use 
by a rescuer in order to force air into a victim while avoiding direct mouth-to-mouth 
contact between the rescuer and the victim. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is one of the most important 
methods in reviving non-breathing victims, particularly by untrained people 
outside the hospital. It is thus, common practice for first aid personnel, 
policemen, firemen and the like, to carry with them a mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitator. In recent years, with the spread of some very severe infectious 
diseases, such as AIDS (acquired immuno deficiency syndrome) or Hepatitis 
B, performance of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in general even by the 
use of mouth-to-mouth resuscitators became problematic in view of the 
possibility that the victim may be a carrier of such an infectious disease and  
 
thus the rescuer may face the risk of becoming infected. The presence of 
infectious particles in exhaled air or in orally emitted body fluids such as in 
exhaled saliva or vomit, is known for some infectious diseases and is 
believed to be present in others. As a result people are now very reluctant 
to even come into contact with exhaled air or body fluids of unfamiliar 
individuals, a fortiori to inhale such exhaled air or orally emitted fluids. 
Consequently, there have been numerous reports of cases in which non-breathing 
victims were left untreated until the arrival of medical personnel 
equipped with resuscitation instruments, this critical delay in resuscitation 
resulting in the victim's death. U.S. Patent 4,819,628, discloses a resuscitator intended to solve 
the above-noted problems associated with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
The resuscitator in accordance with this patent comprises a rigid tube fixed 
with a one-way valve and extending from the tube is a flexible sheet 
intended to physically shield the rescuer from the victim. The one-way 
valve consists of a flexible sleeve opened at the upper end and having a 
bottom end which is normally closed by the biasing force of a strip spring 
made of rigid and flexible material secured to the bottom end of the sleeve. Another mouth-to-mouth resuscitator meant to solve some of 
the above-noted problems has been disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,697,587. The 
resuscitator of this patent includes a hollow body fitted at its upper end with 
a mask intended to cover the victim's mouth during resuscitation and has a 
flapper type valve inside the hollow body. This flapper type valve closes 
when the victim exhales,

<CLAIMS>
A mouth-to-mouth resuscitator device for use by a rescuer in 
order to force air into a victim while avoiding direct mouth-to-mouth 

contact between the rescuer and the victim, said device comprising: 
   a vertically extending hollow open-ended body (10) adapted to 

transmit air exhaled from the rescuer to the victim and having a first, top 
(12) and a second, bottom (14) portions, the first portion (12) has an 

essentially circular mouth piece at its upper end, and the second portion (14) 
is adapted to be inserted into the victim's mouth; 

   a one-way valve assembly (16) contained in said hollow body (10) and 
dividing it into said first (12) and second (14) portions and permitting air 

passage only from the first portion (12) into the second portion (14), the 
valve assembly (16) comprising a rigid valve seat (24) and a flexible valve 

member (26) below the valve seat (24), the valve seat (24) having a central 
portion (44) allowing free air passage, and the valve member (26) being 

essentially disk-shaped and being upwardly biased against the valve seat 
(24) so that peripheral portions of the valve member (26) presses against 

peripheral portions of the valve seat to form an air-tight contact; and 
   a pliable sheet (18) extending laterally from around said hollow body 

(10) from about the zone thereof being between said first (12) and said 
second (14) portions of said sheet (18), separating between the mouth area 

of the victim and the mouth of the rescuer. 
A resuscitator according to Claim 1, wherein the second portion 
(14) is sufficiently long to serve as a buffer zone preventing solid 

microparticles or aerosol particles coming from the victim to reach the valve 
assembly. 
A resuscitator according to Claim 1, wherein: 
   the central portion (44) of the valve seat (24) comprises spokes (49) 

radially extending from a centrally bored, hub-like member (46) in the 
 

middle of said central portion and comprising an annular ridge (50) 
protruding downwardly from a bottom face of the valve seat (24) at the 

periphery thereof; 
   the valve member (26) is made of an elastic material and has a 

diameter somewhat larger than that of the annular ridge (50), the valve 
member (26) having a central anchoring leg (34) adapted to be inserted in 

the bore (48) in said hub-like member (46) and brought into a locking 
position in which the valve member (26) is anchored in said valve assembly 

(16); and 
   in said locking position a peripheral portion (30) of the valve member 

(26) is biased against the peripheral annular ridge (50) of the valve seat (24) 
forming with said annular ridge (50) an airtight seal.
