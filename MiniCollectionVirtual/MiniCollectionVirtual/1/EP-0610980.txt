and check-valve disks (20) therefore having 

annularly-spaced passages including holes (46). A 
preferred embodiment for EMD diesel and dual-fuel 

engines is a unit injector (10) with a flat circular

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to check-valves for use in high-pressure fuel
injectors.It is known in the art relating to unit fuel
injectors for diesel engines to provide a positive
displacement plunger pump with a controlled output to
pump fuel at high-pressure through a spray tip
directly into an associated combustion chamber for
combustion therein. A well-known feature of such
injectors is the provision of a flat check-valve to
prevent the back-flow of fuel or combustion gases from
the combustion chamber and spray tip into the plunger
pump location. A known type of flat check-valve is in
the form of a small disk having the outer edges
scalloped to provide flow passages for fuel when the
valve is open and seated upon an annular seat open
internally to a flow chamber. Such check-valves have
been used for many years in some of the unit fuel
injectors made by General Motors Corporation and
subsequently by Diesel Technology Corporation,
including those supplied for use in the well-known
Electro-Motive Division (EMD) diesel and dual-fuel
engines manufactured for railroad locomotives and
other applications. US-A-4550875 discloses a check
valve in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.A check valve in accordance with the present
invention is characterised over US-A-4550875 by the
features specified in the characterising portion of
claim 1.The present invention provides improved
embodiments and concepts for a disk check-valve for
use in and in combination with high-pressure fuel 
injectors of the type described and equivalent
applications. In a preferred embodiment, the injector
is a unit type diesel fuel injector, particularly one
for use in EMD diesel engines and the check-valve
comprises a circular disk having flow passages 
comprising a plurality of holes equally spaced on a
circle between the edge and the centre of the disk.
At present, seven holes are preferred. Such an
arrangement has been shown to apparently provide more
stable action of the check-valve along with reduced
pumping force required for injection at the higher
fuel rates needed for recent engine applications.
Improved combustion and operational efficiency have
been obtained as a result.Numerous variations of the concept are
contemplated as potentially providing similar
advantages.These and other features and advantages of
the invention will be more fully understood from the
following description of certain specific embodiments
of the invention taken together with the accompanying
drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A check-valve for use in a high-pressure
unit fuel injector (10) having a member (22) with a

central fuel delivery opening (40) to be
intermittently supplied with high-pressure fuel and a

flat valve seat (39) surrounding the opening (40), a
valve cage (19) seated against the member (22) and

including a recess (32) adjacent the valve seat (39),
the recess (32) including an annular ledge (34) facing

the valve seat (39), the ledge (34) being centred on
and having an inner periphery (35) substantially

larger than the delivery opening (40), an
inwardly-facing annular rim (36) surrounding the ledge

(34), and a delivery chamber (33) inward of the ledge
(34) for receiving fuel delivered from the delivery

opening (40), wherein said check-valve
comprises a disk (20;54;56;59) receivable in the

recess (32) and having opposite first and second flat
faces (43) alternately seatable against the valve seat

(39) and the ledge (34) respectively, an outer edge
(44) receivable in opposed relation to the rim (36)

and having limited radial clearance therefrom when
centred in the recess (32), characterised by a plurality of holes

(46;55;58;60) extending through the disk (20) between
the flat faces (43), the holes (46;55;58;60) being

located wholly outwardly of a circle of diameter equal
to the sum of the diameter of the delivery opening

(40) at the valve seat (39) and the radial clearance
of the centred disk (20), said holes (46;55;58;60)
