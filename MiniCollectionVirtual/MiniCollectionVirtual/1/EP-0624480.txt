<ABSTRACT>
A first sensor 102 has a characteristic in that light generated from an 
associated light-emitting unit penetrates yellow, magenta and clear patches 

810, 820, 801-3, 701-3 but does not penetrate cyan and black patches 830, 
700a-700c, 600 of an ink ribbon 600, 700, 800. A second sensor 202 

installed on a straight line with the first sensor 102 widthwise of the ink 
ribbon has a characteristic in that light generated from an associated light-emitting 

unit penetrates the yellow and clear patches of the ink ribbon but 
does not penetrate magenta, cyan and black patches. A third sensor 204 

installed on an opposite side of the first and second sensors 102, 202 
widthwise of the ink ribbon, but not on a straight line with the first and 

second sensors 102, 202, has a characteristic in that light generated from an 
associated light-emitting unit penetrates the yellow and clear patches but does 

not penetrate the magenta, cyan and black patches. First and a second 
reflecting panels 302, 304 reflect the light generated by the light emitting unit 

of the first, second and third sensors to respective light-receiving units 
thereof. The apparatus can be
 used in a method to distinguish between a 
colour ribbon 800, a black ribbon 700 with clear patches and a black ribbon 

600 without clear patches in a sublimating type colour printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printer ribbon colour detection.Figure 1 of the accompanying diagrammatic drawings is a drawing of
a conventional colour printer for illustrating how to distinguish a colour ink
ribbon 100 having a yellow patch 100a, magenta patch 100b and cyan patch
100c continuously coated with three colours (yellow, magenta and cyan) of
sublimating type ink.There are formed transparent and colourless clear patches 30, 31 and
32 between the yellow patch 100a, magenta patch 100b and cyan patch 100c.Black markings (30a) (31a) (32a, 32b) are formed on each clear patch
30, 31 and 32 in order to distinguish the yellow patch 100a, magenta patch
100b and cyan patch 100c of the colour ink ribbon 100.A known apparatus for distinguishing the aforesaid colour ink ribbon
100 comprises: first and a second sensors 10 and 20 each having a light-emitting
element and a light-receiving element, and first and second reflecting
panels 10a and 20a for reflecting to the light-receiving elements the light
generated from the first and second light-emitting elements of the sensors 10
and 20.Accordingly, in Figure 1, if the colour ink ribbon 100 is moved
thereby to locate the clear patch 30 between the first and second sensors 10
and 20 and the first and second reflecting panels 10a and 20a, the light
generated by the light-emitting element of the first sensor 10 passes through 
the colour ink ribbon 100 thereby to be reflected at the first reflecting panel
10a.However, the light generated by the light-emitting element of the
second sensor 20 cannot penetrate the black marking 30a, so that the same
cannot be incident upon the light-receiving element.Accordingly, a signal of high level is output from the first sensor 10
and a signal of low level is output from the second sensor 20.As mentioned in the aforesaid, if the signals of high level and low level
are respectively output from the first and second sensors 10 and 20, a
microcomputer (not shown) recognizes the yellow patch 100a.Likewise, if the colour ink ribbon 100 is moved thereby to locate the
clear patch 31 between the first and second sensors 10 and 20 and the first
and second reflecting panels 10a and 20a, the first sensor 10 outputs a signal
of low level by way of the black marking 31a, and the second sensor 20
outputs a signal of high level.As seen from the foregoing, if the low level and high level of signals
are respectively output from the first and second sensors, the microcomputer
recognizes the magenta patch 100b.Furthermore, if the colour ink

A method of detecting colour in a printer ink ribbon, characterised by:

a first step of arranging first, second and third sensors (102, 202, 204)
to detect light transmitted through the ink ribbon;
a second step of transferring the ink ribbon in a forward direction for
a predetermined period of time thereby to recognize the same as a black and

white ribbon (600) with no clear patches if there is no change in an output of
the second sensor (202);
a third step of recognising the ink ribbon as a black and white ink
ribbon (700) having clear patches (701-703) if the third sensor (204) is an ink

ribbon impenetrable state, when there is a change in the output of the second
sensor (202) and the first sensor (102) changes from an ink ribbon

impenetrable state to an ink ribbon penetrable state; and
a fourth step of recognizing the ink ribbon as a colour ink ribbon (800)
if, at the third step, the third sensor (204) is in an ink ribbon penetrable state.
A method as defined in claim 1, comprising:

a step of discriminating a yellow patch (810) in the ink ribbon (800)
thereby to print yellow if the ribbon is recognized as the colour ink ribbon

thereby to print magenta if light generated in association with the second

sensor (202) is not detected thereby as penetrating the ink ribbon (800) after
