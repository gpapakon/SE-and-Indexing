<ABSTRACT>
The explosion valve consists of a wedge-type charge (6) with an igniter (11), and a cover (4) closing the opening and which shears off when the wedge-type charge is ignited. The cover is a thin-walled disc. The wedge-type charge has a second ignition. The igniter and wedge-type charge are positioned in a mounting ring (5) resting on the disc to be sheared off. The side of the disc facing away from the mounting ring has a support ring (7) defining the cutting point and surrounding the disc. An adaptor (8) is fitted on the side of the mounting ring facing away from the disc.
