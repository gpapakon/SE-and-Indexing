<ABSTRACT>
Motor vehicle central locking and immobilizer systems, require contactless actuation of safety/security devices with easy and convenient actuation via a control device and a radio key-code, with a device for making available a change of the carrier frequency of the coded electromagnetic signal, and during signal communication this frequency is changed in a manner known only by the control device and the radio key-code.

<CLAIMS>
Facility for activating a security facility, to protect a motor vehicle against unauthorised use, with

- a control device having means to transmit a first coded electromagnetic signal as a challenge signal (1),
- a portable radio key having means to receive the challenge signal (1) and to transmit a second coded signal as an enable signal,
- the control device being connected to the security facility and activating it when it receives and identifies the enable signal,
- both the control device and the radio key having means to change the carrier frequency of the coded electromagnetic signals and
- the control device and the radio key changing this frequency in a manner known only to the control device and the radio key during signal transmission,
characterised in that
- the manner, in which the carrier frequency is to be changed, is contained in the challenge signal (1) as coded information for transmission to the radio key and
- the receiver and transmitter side carrier frequency selection is determined by means of a cryptographic method independently in the radio key and the control device using the coded information of the challenge signal.
Facility according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the radio key has a narrow-band transmitter, the transmit frequency of which can be controlled, and the radio key changes its transmit frequency at time intervals when transmitting signals.
Facility according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the control device has a tuneable narrow-band receiver with the same frequency range as the radio key transmitter.
Facility according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the challenge signal (1) contains a random number and the carrier frequencies are determined by applying a crypto-algorithm (3) to said challenge signal (1) and thereby in particular to the random number contained in the challenge signal (1).
Facility according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that
 the signal is transmitted by way of a spectrum of different carrier frequencies and the enable signal contains coded information for modulating said spectrum.
