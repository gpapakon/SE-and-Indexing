<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process and an apparatus for desorption, e.g. desorbing a solvent, from a bedding (4) of adsorbent material (14), e.g. activated carbon, by means of a hot gas flow, e.g. air, so that a wave of concentration induces, which goes through the bedding by means of the hot gas flow. The invention is characterized in that the concentration wave is controlled to reach the gas flow outlet of the bedding surface successively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for desorption, e.g.
desorbing a solvent, from a bedding of adsorbent material, e.g.
activated carbon, by means of a hot gas flow, e.g. air, so that a wave
of concentration induces, which goes through the bedding by means of
the hot gas flow. The invention also relates to an apparatus, in which
the process will be carried out.Desorption apparatuses are known e.g. from WO-A-89/10 189 and DE-C-3 141 484.Cleaning out solvent from contaminated air by means of adsorption and
subsequent desorption of matter(s) is a well known engineering
practice. As adsorbent material, activated carbon is often used. To
regenerate the activated carbon, the temperature is raised and
volatile solvents evaporate. For heating purpose a direct inlet of a
hot gas stream which can be condensable, e.g. steam, or non-condensable,
e.g. nitrogen, can be used. Heating can also be caused
indirectly via heating surfaces, at which the means of heating will be
kept separate from the adsorbent material.Adsorption beddings can be solid, which is the most common construction.
During continuous operation, the air must change over to a new
bedding when the adsorption capacity of the working bedding is
exceeded. The adsorption bedding can also be rotating and segmented,
thus air to be purified passes through one segment while strip gas
passes through another segment. In this manner, a simultaneous
purification of contaminated air and a regeneration of the adsorbent
is taking place. A drawback with this construction is that it is
expensive and bulky.At desorption in a solid bedding with a hot, non-condensable strip gas
a heat front with steep temperature gradient will slide through the
bedding. If the gas flow is uniform the heat front will be parallel to
the frontal surface of the bedding, that is, the surface through which
the strip gas penetrates into the bedding. In the flow direction, in 
the front of the heat front, an area will form in which the solvent
concentration in the activated carbon increases due to readsorption of
desorbate, which has desorbed behind the heat front. Thus, in front of
the heat front a concentration wave will form, that is, an area with
increased solvent concentration. When this concentration wave reaches
the outer surface of the bedding, the concentration in the strip gas
leaving the bedding will rise to a level that can be many times higher
than the average concentration in the outgoing strip gas during the
phase of desorption.The varying concentration of solvent in the

Apparatus for carrying out a process for desorbing a solvent from a bedding of adsorbent
material, the apparatus comprising:


a bedding (4) of adsorbent material (14) having a bedding surface (3f) for gas inlet
and a bedding surface (3e) for gas outlet;
means for causing a hot gas flow to pass through the bedding from the bedding surface
(3f) for gas inlet in direction to the bedding surface (3e) for gas outlet to induce

a wave of concentration of solvent that is forced through the bedding by means of the
hot gas flow;

wherein said bedding surfaces (3f, 3e) are so arranged that the bedding provides different
path lengths for different fractions of the gas flow, so that the wave of concentration

induced by the gas flow in the bedding reaches the outlet bedding surface (3e)
successively.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said bedding surface (3f) for gas inlet and
said bedding surface (3e) for gas outlet are non-parallel.
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said bedding surface (31) for gas inlet and
said bedding surface (3e) for gas outlet are flat.
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the bedding surfaces with one another form
an angle so that the relation between the longest gas flow path, going from the bedding

surface (3f) for gas inlet in direction to the bedding surface (3e) for gas outlet,
and the corresponding shortest path is at least equal to 1.3 and at the most equal to

3.
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the relation is between 1.6 and 2.0.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the bedding contains at least two bedding
elements (3a, 3b) which are connected in series during the phase of adsorption, while

the bedding elements during the phase of desorption are connected in parallel, and
wherein the path length will differ between different strip gas fractions going through

the bedding elements.
