<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system and method of creating a 
solid model from a plurality of incomplete drawings. Line segments or 

curves on each view are calculated from two-dimensional data of a three-view 
drawing. A wireframe model is created on the basis of the 

calculated line segments or curves. The wireframe model is corrected by 
comparing edges of the created wireframe model and the line segments or 

curves. The corrected wireframe model is converted into a cell-decomposition 
model. Conditions for at least one of the three-view 

drawing to be correct are set by Boolean expressions. A solid model is 
synthesized on the basis of combinations of cells which are solutions of 

the expressions. If no solution exists even if the expressions are 
solved, candidate models are synthesized on the basis of any combination 

of cells. The synthesized candidate models are displayed in the 
descending order of the degree of similarity. Alternatively, if a 

plurality of combinations of cells which are the solutions do exist, a 
candidate model selected by the operator is determined to be the solid 

model. A three-view drawing for the obtained solid model is newly 
prepared, and the original three-view drawing is made complete on the 

basis of the newly prepared three-view drawings.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid model synthesizer and a 
synthesizing method. More particularly, it relates to a solid model 
synthesizer and a method for synthesizing a solid model or a three-dimensional 
model from a plurality of incomplete drawings. The manufacturing industry has carried out design by preparing 
drawings, and has stored design information in the form of drawings. 
However, as, in recent years, simulation techniques or numerical control 
(NC) techniques have advanced, the evaluation of the function of an 
object to be designed on a computer, or the production of an actual 
prototype by transferring data to machine tools have come into practice. 
In such case, two-dimensional drawings are insufficient, and a three-dimensional 
solid model becomes necessary. Therefore, it has recently 
come to be used more and more to store data on solids, planes, edges, and 
vertex in tabular form, and to use three-dimensional models with various 
functions such as a wireframe presentation function and a surface 
presentation function. Much of conventional design information is stored in the form of 
two-dimensional three-view drawings of front view, side view, and top 
view. Therefore, it is necessary to produce a solid model from the 
three-view drawing holding the design information. However, production 
of the solid model calls for tremendous time and labor. Therefore, 
various studies have been previously conducted on methods for producing 
the solid model from the tri-angular drawings, and various solid model 
production devices have been developed. That is, a three-view drawing input apparatus for preparing a 
three-dimensional configuration drawing by inputting the coordinate data 
of three two-dimensional drawings consisting of a front view, a plan 
view, and a side view has been provided which comprises a cell control 
means dividing a drawing preparation area into square cells of a 
predetermined size depending on the two-dimensional density to be input, 
and a radiated point displaying means for displaying projected points of 
characteristic points, which consist of intersections, break points, and 
junctions on the three two-dimensional drawings, parallel to axes of 
coordinates shared when inputting one of the three two-dimensional 
drawings (PUPA No. 60-201473). In addition, as technique in a system  
 
such as that for CAD or CG for displaying a three-dimensional image in 
two forms of a wireframe model and surface model, an apparatus has been 
provided which simultaneously generates
