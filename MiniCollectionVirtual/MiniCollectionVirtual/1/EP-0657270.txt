<ABSTRACT>
Valve gated injection molding apparatus with a 
spring (120) mounted on a central pin (124) adjacent the 

head (86) of a 
valve member (80) in a spring chamber (104) in each of 

the pistons (90). 
The spring (120) is compressed between the base (126) 

of the pin (124) and 
the cap (114) of the piston (90) to preload it. When the 

valve member (80) 
and piston (90) are driven forwardly to the closed position, the 

head (86) of the valve member (80) retracts somewhat into the spring 
chamber (104) against the force applied forwardly against the 

head (86) of the valve member (80) by the spring (120). 
This cushions the 

impact of the front end (84) of the valve member (80) 
in the gate (16) and 

provides for tight seating of the front end (84) of the valve 
member (80) in the gate (16) without requiring all of the components 

to be made to precise tolerances with exact allowance for 
thermal expansion. The spring (120) is a number of selected disc 

springs stacked in sets facing in opposite directions, from 
which the force applied to the head (86) of the valve member (80) is 

predetermined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to injection
molding and more particularly to valve gated apparatus
wherein the valve member pistons have a spring in a spring
chamber.Valve gated injection molding systems or
apparatus with pneumatic or hydraulic actuated pistons to
reciprocate the valve member are well known. An example
wherein the cap of the piston is retained in place by a
resilient retaining ring is shown in U.S. Patent Number
4,698,013 to Butcher which issued October 6, 1987.
However, the prior apparatus has the disadvantage that the
components must be made to very precise tolerances with
exact allowance for thermal expansion in order to have the
front end of the valve member seated exactly in the gate in 
the forward closed position. If the front end of the valve
member does not extend far enough forwardly to seat tightly
in the gate in the closed position, an undesirable poor
gate vestage will result. On the other hand, if the front
end of the valve member extends too far forwardly, the
repeated impact in the gate on closing will cause undue
wearing of the front end of the valve member and the gate
and can result in a fracture of the mold around the gate in
some instances.Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to at least partially overcome the disadvantages
of the prior art by providing valve gated apparatus wherein
the engagement of the valve member by the piston is spring
loaded whereby the front end of the valve member seats in
the gate in the closed position without necessitating that
the components be made to such precise tolerances.To this end, in one of its aspects, the invention
provides valve gated injection molding apparatus having a
melt passage extending to a gate leading to a cavity, a
valve member with an elongated shaft, a front end, and a
rear end extending through the melt passage in alignment
with the gate, the valve member having an enlarged head at
the rear end, the enlarged head of the valve member being 
engaged by a piston having a cap removably attached to a
main body with a bore through which the elongated shaft of
the valve member extends forwardly, the piston being driven
in a cylinder to reciprocate the valve member between a
retracted open position and a forward closed position in
which the front end of the valve member is seated in the
gate, having the improvement wherein the main body of the
piston has a spring chamber extending in alignment with the
valve member, the spring chamber having a rear end which is
closed by the removable cap and a front

<CLAIMS>
A valve gated injection molding apparatus having
a melt passage (10) extending to a gate (16) leading to a cavity (18), a

valve member (80) with an elongated shaft (82), a front end (84), and a
rear end (88) extending through the melt passage in alignment

with the gate, the valve member having an enlarged head (86) at
the rear end, the enlarged head of the valve member being

engaged by a piston (90) having a cap (114) removably attached to a
main body (102) with a bore (118) through which the elongated shaft of

the valve member extends forwardly, the piston being driven
in a cylinder (92) to reciprocate the valve member between a

retracted open position and a forward closed position in
which the front end of the valve member is seated in the

gate, characterized in that;

the main body of the piston has a spring chamber (104)

extending in alignment with the valve member (80), the spring
chamber having a rear end (112) which is closed by the removable

cap (114) and a front end (116) from which the valve member bore
(118) extends, the head (86) of the valve member being received in the

spring chamber with the elongated shaft of the valve member
extending forwardly therefrom through the valve member

bore, the head of the valve member being larger than the
valve member bore whereby a stop is provided by the front 

end of the spring chamber, and compressible spring means (120-124)
mounted in the spring chamber rearwardly adjacent the head

of the valve member, whereby in the closed position the
head of the valve member retracts somewhat into the spring

chamber against a predetermined force applied forwardly
against the head of the valve member by the spring means.
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
1, characterized in that the spring means includes a plurality of disc

springs (120) mounted in a stack (122) on a central pin (124) in the spring
chamber.
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
2, characterized in that the central pin has an enlarged base (126) which abuts

against the head (86) of the valve member in the closed
position, the stack of disc springs being preloaded by

being compressed between the enlarged base of the pin and
the cap (114) of the piston, whereby the predetermined force is

applied through the base of the pin to the head of the
valve member.
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
3, characterized in that the spring chamber extends centrally in the main

body of the piston and is generally cylindrical with a
circular shoulder (134) against which the base of the central pin 

is in bearing contact in the open position, the circular
shoulder being positioned longitudinally in the spring

chamber to ensure that in the open position the head of the
valve member has clearance to move laterally in the spring

chamber due to thermal expansion of the manifold.
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
4, characterized in that each of the disc springs (120) is slightly conical in

shape.
Injection molding apparatus as claimed in claim
5, characterized in that the disc springs are mounted in a plurality of

sets, with the disc springs in alternate sets facing in
opposite directions.
