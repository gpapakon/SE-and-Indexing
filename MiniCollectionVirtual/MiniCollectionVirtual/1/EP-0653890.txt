<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal display projection system for providing improved 
brightness. A light beam is split by a polarizing beam splitter (20) into two 

polarized beams having substantially orthogonal polarizations. Each beam is 
reflected by a mirror (40, 42) toward an opposite side of a liquid crystal display 

(30), so that the two beams pass through the display in opposite directions. The 
two beams are then reflected by the mirrors back toward the polarizing beam 

splitter, where they are recombined into a single beam for projection onto a 
screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to projection systems, and more 
particularly to projection systems employing liquid crystal displays. Liquid crystal display (LCD) projection systems offer the advantages of 
large image areas, compactness, ease of setup, light weight, and low cost 
compared with competing technologies. An LCD is comprised of thousands of 
small picture elements, or "pixels", which are either "on", "off', or "partially on". 
An image is displayed by the LCD by the appropriate manipulation, usually by 
applying an electric field, of the individual pixels. In the case of a twisted nematic 
(TN) LCD, if a particular pixel is "on", then the phase, and thus the polarization, 
of a linearly polarized light ray will remain unchanged as it passes through the 
pixel. However, if the pixel is "off', then the light ray will be rotated, i.e., its 
phase will be modulated so that its polarization angle is changed by 90 degrees. 
If the pixel is "partially on", then the light ray will be rotated by less than 90 
degrees. An "on" pixel can be designated to represent either black or white. If 
the "on" pixel is designated as black, then the "off" pixel is designated as white, 
and vice versa. A "partially on" pixel represents a shade of gray. Polarizers are 
then provided on the LCD so that the polarization state of the light passing through 
the pixel is converted into the appropriate amount of transmission (black, white, 
or gray). In the case of a super twisted nematic (STN) LCD, the optical effect arises 
from birefringence effects so that "on", "off', and "partially on" pixels each have 
a characteristic birefringence color. If the "blue mode" is used, the "off' pixel 
will have a blue color while the "on" pixel will be cream colored. If the "yellow 
mode" is used, the "off" pixel will be yellow and the "on" pixel will be blue-gray.  
 
A film may be added between the STN LCD and one of its polarizers to neutralize 
the color of the display, i.e., to convert the color display to a black and white 
display. Presently, LCD projection systems suffer from low brightness compared 
to directly viewed cathode ray tube devices; e.g., televisions. It would be 
desirable to have an LCD projection system having improved brightness. Accordingly, the present invention includes a method of projecting an 
image formed on a polarization-modulating display, such as an LCD. The method 
includes the steps of directing a light beam toward a beam splitting means, such 
as a polarizing beam splitter, which
