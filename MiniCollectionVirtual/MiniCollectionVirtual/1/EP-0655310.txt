<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a wood-like product and the wood-like product which is 
similar to wood in touch and presents a grain similar to that of natural wood depending upon a molding condition. 

More specifically, a crushed powder (102) obtained by crushing a cellulose material as a raw material is ground into 
powder (111, 121) having an increased bulk density. Fixed to the outher peripheral surface of the powder (111, 121) 

are surface grains (112, 122) each having a smaller diameter and a greater hardness than those of the powder (111, 
121) to provide fixing grains (110, 120) which in turn are mixed with resin and pigment to be melted. Thereafter or 

concurrently with the melting, the grains (110, 120) are formed into a desired shape by extrusion molding or injection 
molding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relate to a wooden-like product
manufacturing method and a wooden-like product, and more
particularly to a method of manufacturing a product having a
wood-like feeling, in particular, a wooden-like product
close to one made of natural wood including an outer appearance,
by using as raw materials pulverized dust of a cellulose
material, and to such a wooden-like product.Recently, it has been attempted to finish the surfaces
of various furnitures or commodities with a feeling of
natural wood by imparting, to synthetic resin moldings,
surface characteristics and color tones close to those of
natural wood.Such a wooden-like resin product close to one made of
natural wood has been manufactured as follows. For coloring
the product in a color tone similar to that of natural wood
to present aspects of that wood, a predetermined amount of
wood dust and a pigment corresponding to the desired color
tone have been added to a molding resin material when a 
synthetic resin molding is molded, so that the resin molding
has a color tone and a look close to those of the natural
wood of interest.Alternatively, for giving only the surface of a product
aspects like natural wood, a predetermined amount of wood
dust has been added to a paint when a surface coating or
film is formed, for example, so that the surface of a resin
molding has a color tone and a look close to those of the
natural wood of interest.Wood dust added to a molding resin material is often
improved so as not to generate wood vinegar gas in a molding
machine during the resin molding for the purpose of increasing
dispersity of wood dust in a mixture with resin. Known
typical wood dust is surface ground dust of particle boards
whose surfaces are hardened by a treatment using phenol or
urea resin.Main features of surface ground dust of particle boards
are that the dust is fine, has less cilia on the surface,
and has a granular shape providing a high smoothness. Thus,
because of being fine and having a high smoothness, surface
ground dust is regarded as wood dust which is satisfactorily
dispersed and mixed in powdery resin materials.On the other hand, wood dust obtained by directly
pulverizing wood into fine dust has had a disadvantage that
the pulverizing efficiency is low regardless of whether the 
wood dust is pulverized by a dry or wet pulverizer, and a
great amount of large-sized wood dust remain in the pulverized
dust even after the pulverizing process for a long
time. Also, this type of wood dust is not granular in
shape, and most
