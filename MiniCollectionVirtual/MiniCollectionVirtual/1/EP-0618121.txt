<ABSTRACT>
A device for the automatic remote operating of the pedals of a 
motor vehicle includes a frame (11, 12, 13, 14, 15) which houses and 

guides a pair of slides (20, 21) axially sliding under the action of a power 
unit (25) mounted on said frame, a fork-like member (60) suitable to hook 

to a pedal of a motor vehicle being mounted on one of said slides (20), 
and a member (36) suitable to abut against the driver's seat being 

mounted on the other slide (21), said power unit (25) including a unit for 
the remote control thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns devices for analysing and tuning 
motor vehicles, and in particular a remotely controlled device for pushing 
and releasing the pedals of a motor vehicle. It is known that said pedals are provided with an automatic 
mechanism to go back to the rest position for obvious safety reasons. 
However, this feature is a drawback during repairings or adjustments of 
the members controlled by the pedals. In this case, in fact, it is necessary 
to repeatedly push and release the pedals. Presently, the operator carrying out the adjustment requires the help 
of an assistant which performs this pushing and releasing operation on 
the pedals according to the instructions of the operator, which can even 
be under the vehicle. The serious drawback implicit in this method is apparent, since it is 
necessary to employ double labour, with all the cost problems related 
thereto. Moreover, problems may arise concerning the synchronization 
between the operator's actions and his assistant's ones. The object of the present invention is to provide a remotely controlled 
device suitable to replace the operator's assistant, so that the operator 
himself performs the required actions on the pedals with no need to move 
from his working position. This object is achieved by means of a device having the 
characteristics cited in claim 1. Therefore, the device according to the present invention permits the 
advantageous replacement of the extra labour required in conventional 
adjustment operations, thus allowing a single operator to carry out the 
operation with a considerable saving of time. This and other advantages and characteristics of the device 
according to the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the 
art from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment 
thereof referring to the annexed drawings wherein:  Fig.1 is a schematic side view of a device according to the invention 
applied to a car; Fig.2 is a schematic side view of the device in an almost completely 
closed position; Fig.3 is a schematic plan view of the device in an almost completely 
closed position; Fig.4 is a cross-sectional view along line A-A of fig.3; Fig.5 is an enlarged longitudinal sectional view along line B-B of 
fig.3; and Fig.6 is a simplified plan view of the device in an extended position. Referring to figs.2, 3 and 4, there is seen that a device according to 
the present invention, globally indicated by 10, includes a frame formed 
by a central structure 11 connected through a pair
