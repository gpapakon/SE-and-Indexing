<DESCRIPTION>
 A control circuit system for control of parameters in logic circuits or similar.Technical areaThe present invention relates to a control circuit system for controlling one or more parameters in a circuit with at least one operational stage, particularly a differential stage, in the form of delay stage or a logic stage, said operational stage including at least one operational circuit, at least one operatio¬ nal current source for supplying a first drive current to said operational stage, and at least one operational load. The conception control includes here optimization and the conception parameter includes power and/or bandwidth and/or delay.The state of the art Power optimization and/or bandwidth optimization of logic circuits up to now has been obtained by designing different logic parts with different bandwidth, to enable optimization of bandwidth and by this reduction of power consumption.As regards delay stages the state of the art includes different possibilities.The most usual way is to adjust a threshold level or a decision point along a flank and thereby shift a switch-over of a following stage forwards or backwards in time.Another method is to add or subtract a capacitive load in a circuit stage for coarse adjustment and change the current for fine adjustment.A third method is to use diodes as collector loads. By varying the current through the diodes the resistances of these will vary, which in turn changes the time constants of 

the circuit.Description of the inventionThe object of the invention is to provide a control circuit system, which enables control of the bandwidth of various delay and logic circuits in a controlled way.This object is achieved by a control circuit system of the kind defined by way of introduction comprising a number of first controllable current source and load components of said operational current source and said opera¬ tional load for admitting control of the magnitude of said first drive current and of said operational load, respectively, at least one reference stage comprising essentially an image circuit of said operational stage with a reference current source for supplying a second drive current for said reference stage, and a reference load, said reference current source and said reference load comprising a number of second controllable current source and load components for admitting control of the magnitude of said second drive current and of said reference load, respectively, and being essentially identical to said first current source and load
