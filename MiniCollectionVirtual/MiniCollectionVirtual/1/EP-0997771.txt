<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus
for processing an elongate photographic photosensitive
film by cutting the elongate photographic photosensitive
film to films of various preset lengths, and winding
ends of the cut films on spools.For producing and packaging a photographic photosensitive
film, it has been customary to perform various steps
including the steps of producing a film of given length,
winding the film, placing the wound film into a film cartridge,
and inserting the film cartridge into a case.These various steps are carried out by a facility comprising
a film supply unit for unwinding a film roll of
elongate photographic photosensitive film and cutting (trimming)
the unwound elongate photographic photosensitive film
to a sized film of given length, a film coiling unit for
coiling the sized film of given length on a spool thereby to
produce a film coil, a cartridge producing unit for staking
a cap on an end of a tubular cartridge blank sheet thereby
to produce a cartridge with one open end, an assembling unit
for inserting the film coil into the cartridge and staking
another cap on the open end of the cartridge thereby to produce
an assembled cartridge, and an encasing unit for placing 
the assembled cartridge into a case and attaching a case
cap on an open end of the case thereby to produce a packaged
product.For coiling the sized film of given length on the
spool, the elongate photographic photosensitive film is delivered
through a cutting mechanism by a feeding mechanism,
e.g., a sprocket, which is disposed upstream of the cutting
mechanism. Then, after an end of the photographic photosensitive
film is inserted into a groove in the spool that is
placed in an inserting position in a film inserting unit,
the photographic photosensitive film is fed a preset length
between the inserting position and a cutting position. When
the photographic photosensitive film is cut by the cutting
mechanism, a sized film of given length is produced with its
end inserted in the spool.Packaged products contain differently dimensioned films
having various numbers of frames. For example, commercially
available films with 12, 24, 36 frames are widely used in
the market, and those sized films of given length can automatically
be wound on spools according to the above process.It has been desired to manufacture packaged products
containing sized films of given length having 10 frames or
less, e.g., 5 through 10 frames, which will be presented as
gifts to consumers. Since, however, sized

A method of processing a film by cutting an elongate photographic
photosensitive film (F) to various different preset lengths and inserting an end of

said photographic photosensitive film (F) into a spool (20), comprising the steps of:

if a preset length is greater than a distance from a cutting position for cutting
the photographic photosensitive film (F) to an inserting position for inserting the

photographic photosensitive film (F) into the spool (20), actuating a cutting
mechanism (92) with first cam means (120) to insert an end of the photographic

photosensitive film (F) into the spool (20), and thereafter cutting the photographic
photosensitive film (F) to said preset length;
if said preset length is smaller than said distance, actuating said cutting
mechanism (92) with second cam means (122) to feed the photographic

photosensitive film (F) by said preset length and cutting the photographic
photosensitive film (F), and thereafter inserting an end of the cut photographic

photosensitive film (F) into the spool (20); and
inspecting whether the spool (20) is positioned or not before the spool (20) is
fed to an inserting station for inserting the photographic photosensitive film (F) into

the spool (20).
A method according to claim 1, further comprising the step of:
if the spool (20) is determined to be defective, feeding said spool (20) to said

inserting station and thereafter discharging the spool (20) only without inserting the
photographic photosensitive film (F) into the spool (20).
A method according to claim 1 or 2, further comprising the steps of:
if the photographic photosensitive film (F) is determined to be defective,

feeding a defective portion of the photographic photosensitive film (F), cutting off
the defective portion of the photographic photosensitive film (F), and automatically

discharging the defective portion which has been cut off.
