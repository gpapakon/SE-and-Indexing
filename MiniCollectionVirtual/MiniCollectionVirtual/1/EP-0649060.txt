<ABSTRACT>
A processor (10) including means for processing a photosensitive 
material (12) to render latent images of photographed 

subjects on the photosensitive material visible, 
means (28) for automatically reading a visible test indicia 

on the photosensitive material (12) to determine predetermined 
characteristics of the test indicia and means (22) for 

determining whether or not the characteristics of the 
visible test indicia are within a predetermined range. Also 

included are means (24) for automatically creating a latent 
image of the test indicia on the photosensitive materi

(12). The processing means (26) are adapted to process the 

photosensitive material to render the latent image of the 
test indicia visible. Further included are means (32) for 

adjusting the processing means, if the characteristics of 
the visible test indicia are not within the predetermined 

range, to control one or more processing parameters of the 
processing means (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field 
of photography, and, more particularly, to the 
processing of photosensitive material such as silver-halide 
based film and paper. In the photographic art, processors are used 
to render latent images on photosensitive material 
visible and nonphotosensitive. Typical processors 
include a series of liquid baths which develop, bleach, 
fix and rinse (wash) the photosensitive material. Processor control monitoring is desired for 
daily start-up and intermittent monitoring of the 
processor or for image quality problem diagnostic 
information. Processor control in a typical system, 
such as the Noritsu QSS 1201, is maintained by the use 
of control strips. These control strips are specially 
exposed photosensitive materials usually made by the 
material manufacturer and provided at a cost to the 
photofinisher. In a photographic printer, the control 
strips are used to monitor the processor section 
isolated from the imaging operation. In use, the refrigerated control strip is 
warmed up to ambient temperature, taken to a darkroom, 
removed from its light-tight package, placed in a dark 
bag or paper magazine and taken to the processor. A 
leader card is then attached to the leading edge of the 
control strip. All processing of photosensitive 
material is halted. The leader card is inserted into a 
special light tight slot in the processor where it tows 
the process control strip through the processor. The processed control strip is removed from 
the leader card and brought to a densitometer, such as 
the X-Rite Model 810, which takes readings of the 
control strip. The readings from the densitometer are 
compared to process limits and/or plotted on a hand or  
 
off-line computer chart. The processor is considered 
(1) in control if the densitometer readings fall within 
acceptable control limits or (2) out of control when 
the readings fall outside of the control limits. If 
the processor is out of control, appropriate quality 
corrective action is initiated. After the corrective 
action is complete, the above procedure is repeated to 
determine if the processor is within the control 
limits. U.S. Patent No. 5,083,152 (the '152 
reference) discloses a photographic processing device 
including an exposing section for printing an image on 
a light-sensitive material in accordance with exposure 
conditions. A processor section performs developing, 
fixing, washing and drying operations with respect to 
the printed light sensitive material. A density

a photosensitive material (12; 46) to render latent 

images of photographed subjects on the photosensitive 
material visible, means (28) for automatically reading 

one or more visible test indicia (48) on the photo-sensitve 
material (12; 46) to determine predetermined 

characteristics of the test indicia (48), and means (22) 
for determining whether or not the characteristics of 

the visible test indicia are within a predetermined 
range, the improvement comprising:
