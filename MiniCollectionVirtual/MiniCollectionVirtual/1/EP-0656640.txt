<ABSTRACT>
A pressing operation while an operation lever is 
tilted is inhibited by causing an enlarged portion of the 

operation lever to butt against a stopper. A tilting 
operation while an operation lever is pressed is inhibited 

by causing the enlarged portion to butt against the 
stopper. Therefore, the two operations can not be 

concurrently performed so that a set switch and a select 
switch are inhibited from being simultaneously turned on. 

Furthermore, the operation lever is supported in a 
tiltable manner by forming support shafts and rotation 

shafts whose axes perpendicularly intersect each other. 
Even when foreign substances are trapped in rotation 

portions of the support shafts and the rotation shafts, 
therefore, there is little fear that the foreign 

substances will remain trapped between the mating or 
contacting portions, thereby ensuring that the operation 

lever can be tilted smoothly and returned to the neutral 
position. In addition, a switch matrix ensures that 

signals from adjacent switches are accurately processed. 
A switch element also ensures simultaneous activation of 

circuits to avoid transient signaling errors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lever switch device in
which a switch can be activated by pressing an operation
lever in the longitudinal direction, or tilting the operation
lever, and particularly to a multi-direction switch
device that may be utilized as a so-called joystick or the
like having a lever tiltable in multiple directions. The
invention also relates to methods for activating and connecting
switches.A lever switch device is disclosed in Japanese Utility
Model Publication (Kokai) No. SHO-61-201244. As shown in
Fig. 1, the lever switch device comprises an operation
lever 72. The operation lever 72 includes a substantially
hemispherical rotor 73 that slidingly contacts a hemispherical
guide face 71 of an upper hollow portion of a
housing 70 so as to be rotatably guided. The rotor 73 also
includes a sliding rod 74 that is slidably fitted into the
rotor 73 so as to pass through the center of the rotor 73.When a knob 75 at the upper end of the sliding rod 74
is pressed under the neutral state of the operation lever
72, an operation pin 76 is pressed down by the lower end of
the sliding rod 74, whereby a switch 77 disposed under the
operation pin 76 is activated. When the knob 75 is released,
the operation lever 72 returns to the original
state by a return spring 80.When the operation lever 72 is tilted from the neutral
state, the sliding rod 74 and the rotor 73 are rotated as
an integral unit so that an operation pin 78 is pressed
down by the outer edge of the lower face of the rotor 73,
whereby a switch 79 disposed under the operation pin 78 is
activated. When the operation lever 72 is released, the operation
lever 72 is returned to the original state by a return
spring 81. In the structure of the prior art lever switch device,
the sliding rod 74 and the rotor 73 can be rotated under
the state where the knob 75 is pressed down by a pressing
operation of the operation lever 72, and the knob 75 can be
pressed down under the state where the sliding rod 74 and
the rotor 73 are rotated integrally by a tilting operation
of the operation lever 72. In other words, this conventional
structure is not provided with means for preventing
the operation lever 72 from being concurrently subjected to
both the pressing and tilting operations.Consequently, there may arise a case where the switch
77, which can be activated by a pressing operation, and the
switch 79, which can be activated by a tilting operation,
are simultaneously activated. As a result, circuits that
operate in accordance with the activation state of
