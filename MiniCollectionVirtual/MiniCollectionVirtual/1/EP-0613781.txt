<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printing head (40) for effecting 
printing by ejection of ink includes a first 

electrothermal transducer (16,17) having a heat generating 
resistor (16) with a first area and wiring (17) electrically 

connected with the heat generating resistor; a second 
electrothermal transducer (12,13;14,15) having a second heat 

generating resistor (12;14) with an area which is different 
from the area of the first heat generating resistor (16)
; 
wherein bubbles are produced in ink materials upon 

application of electric signals to the electrothermal 
transducers, by which different volumes of ink 

materials are ejected; wherein the first and second 
electrothermal transducers have substantially the same 

bubble production threshold voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet printing head for 
effecting recording by ejecting liquid droplets, more 
particularly to an ink jet printing head, an ink jet head 
cartridge and an ink jet printing apparatus using 
electrothermal transducer elements as ejection energy 
generating elements. US-5 121 143 describes an ink jet printing head comprising a 
thermal head member having at least one thermal element 
consisting of a plurality of thermal dot elements, a guide 
member having ink supplied grooves contacting the thermal 
elements and being moved reciprocatingly and a plurality of 
electrodes of different widths connected to each thermal 
element, wherein different sized heated portions of the 
thermal element are obtainable and it is possible to vary the 
amount of ink jetted in one dot.  
 The ink jet recording technique is 
advantageous in that the noise is low, that the 
recording speed is high, that the recording is 
possible so-called plain paper not a heat sensitive 
paper, that a color recording is possible by ejecting 
different color inks. However, in order to provide a 
sharp and clear color recording particularly on plain 
paper, the following problems remain. It is difficult to suppress color mixture 
(so-called bleeding) at a boundary between different 
colors with sufficient recording density maintained, 
on the plain paper. In order for the character or 
line to be sharply and clearly formed on the plain 
paper, the ink comprising approx. 20 % by weight of 
diethylene glycol, approx. 3 % by weight of ethanol, 
approx. 3 % by weight of dye, and the remaining part 
of the water. If such an ink is used, the dots formed  
 
on the plain paper by the ejected liquid droplets are 
sharp at the edges and are of high density, if there 
are no color boundaries between adjacent different 
color portions. However, such an ink normally exhibits low 
penetrating speed into the recording material and slow 
drying after deposition on the recording material, and 
therefore, if different color dots are formed adjacent 
to each other, the above-described bleeding occurs 
with the result of remarkably unclear recording The 
tendency increases with increase of color printing 
speed. And therefore, it is highly desired that the 
problems solved particularly in the case of high speed 
color recording. The inventors have carried out repeated tests 
using yellow, magenta, cyan and black (Y, M, C, Bk) 
and plain paper, under the condition of 360 dpi (dots 
per inch). It has been found that the
