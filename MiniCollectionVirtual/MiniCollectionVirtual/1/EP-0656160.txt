<ABSTRACT>
A cryogenically cooled circuit (10), operating at temperatures at which inductor windings of the circuit (10) exhibit superconducting characteristics, provides unique advantages in high performance, preferably high power circuits. The entire circuit (10) is cryogenically cooled in a compartment (16) in a refrigeration device (12). The cryogenically cooling of all the components of the circuit (10) such as diodes and gating elements (MOSFET's) yields a circuit which enables the operation of a power switching supply at a lower frequency using large inductor values. The refrigeration penalty is overcome with power outputs on the order of 50 kilowatts while, and equally importantly, size, component count and stability benefits are attained by cryogenically cooling the entire circuit configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CRYOGENIC ELECTRONICS POWER SUPPLY AND POWER SINKThe invention relates generally to large capacity power supply amplifier and motor controller methods and apparatus and in particular to large capacity, reduced size supply methods and apparatus employing cryogenic cooling.Background of the InventionBoth before and since the advent of high temperature superconductors, many investigators have analyzed and experimented to determine the operating characteristics of circuit components at low temperatures. In particular, the operation of MOSFET's, superconducting inductors, and cryocooled capacitors have been examined and thermal models have been developed for these components. For example, power MOSFET's have been operated at temperatures of 77 K, and, significant advantages have been noted, such as a reduction of the on-resistance of the MOSFET's by as much as a factor of 30, at 77 K. Nevertheless, researchers have not considered the advantages of cryogenically cooled components operating together in a circuit configuration, for example, because of the refrigeration cost associated with cryogenically cooled electronics. Cryocooled electronics have been considered for enhanced noise performance of amplifiers, and to speed up computer circuitry.As will be described in more detail below, one particularly advantageous use of cryogenically cooled electronics is in high power switching power supplies. To understand those advantages in more detail, however, a brief discussion of the limitations of such power supplies operating at room temperature needs to be considered. Switch mode amplifiers, often called class D amplifiers, regulated power supplies, and frequency converters became a reality with the introduction of high speed power silicon devices. The main advantages of these switch mode applications is that, at least for ideal devices, the only 

losses involved are the saturation losses of the power devices in the forward direction. These losses are very low compared to the losses sustained in linear regulation or amplification devices; and these low losses have allowed the physical size of regulated power supplies to be reduced considerably.For example, a linearly-regulated, three voltage, 200 watt power supply was typically over a cubic foot in volume, contained a heavy and expensive power transformer with its associated filtering components, and required approximately 200 watts of dissipation capacity in the active devices. In the newer switch mode versions of these 200 watt power supplies, which appear in
