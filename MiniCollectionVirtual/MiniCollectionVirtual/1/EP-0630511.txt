<ABSTRACT>
A musical percussion instrument consists of more than three integrally formed, substantially linear, elongate sections. The sections are not colinear, but are substantially coplanar. The sections form a shape, and are made from a material (typically metal or a ceramic material) which has vibrational properties such that, when one section is struck with a mallet, the instrument emits a musically concordant sound. The mathematical analysis leading to alternative designs for such an instrument having five sections (termed a ''pentangle''), made by bending mild steel rod, is presented. The sound produced by the instrument may be acoustically or electronically amplified. An array of ''pentangles'' (60), each tuned to different pitch, may be assembled to provide the equivalent of a keyboard instrument.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE: "A MUSICAL PERCUSSION INSTRUMENT"Technical FieldThis invention relates to percussion instruments. More particularly, it concerns a musical percussion instrument containing a series of elongate, non-colinear, integrally formed sections which, when one section is struck with a mallet or beater, emits a musically pleasant sound. The quality of the emitted sound varies according to the nature of the mallet (soft or hard) and the way in which the instrument is struck. When struck with a hard beater or mallet, the instrument emits a bell-like sound containing partial tones in nearly harmonic relationship.Background ArtThe closest prior art to the present invention is the musical instrument commonly known as the "orchestral triangle" or the "percussion triangle". The traditional orchestral triangle produces a characteristic "triangle" sound of indefinite pitch. The triangle is not tuned to provide an harmonious sound. Although the relation between the mode frequencies of a percussion triangle could be varied to some extent by changing the base angles and corner curvatures of the triangle, the extent of such tuning is quite limited. It is possible to design a triangle having a nominal pitch fixed by its overall size, so as to bring two other mode frequencies into harmonic relation with this nominal pitch. However, the remaining inharmonic partials in such a "tuned" triangle are significantly prominent, and this is regarded by musicians as a limitation to the usefulness of the triangle. 

Disclosure of the InventionIt is an object of the present invention to provide a musical percussion instrument having a series of elongate, non-colinear, integrally formed sections that is tuned to provide a musically pleasant sound when a section is struck by a mallet or beater.This objective is achieved by providing a musical percussion instrument comprising a length or piece of metal or other suitable material (for example, a ceramic material) which is formed into a shape of more than three sections which, when one section is struck, will emit a sound having a frequency spectrum which is musically concordant. The sections of metal or other material are formed into a shape that is substantially planar, and preferably the frequency spectrum of the emitted sound is such that at least the first five in-plane modes are substantially harmonically related.Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a percussion instrument comprising a plurality of more than three integrally formed elongate sections, said

CLAIMS
1. A percussion instrument comprising a plurality of more than three elongate sections, said sections being substantially co-planar, non-colinear, and formed integrally from a material which, at room temperature, is rigid and has vibrational properties such that, when one of the sections is struck with a mallet, the instrument emits a musically concordant sound.
2. A percussion instrument as defined in claim 1, having five sections.
3. A percussion instrument as defined in claim 1 or claim 2, in which the lengths of the sections and the angles included by adjacent sections are such that,
β
 when one of the sections is struck by a striker to excite vibrational modes lying in the plane of the sections of the instrument, the sound that is emitted by the instrument has a series of harmonically related frequencies.
4. A percussion instrument as defined in any preceding claim, in which each section is of substantially uniform cross-section, and the sections of the instrument have essentially the same cross-sectional shape and dimensions.
5. A percussion instrument as defined in claim 4, in which said sections are sections of a metal or metal alloy 


 rod or bar, and the instrument is formed by bending the metal or metal-alloy rod or bar.
6. A percussion instrument as defined in claim 5, in which the metal is mild steel.
7. A percussion instrument as defined in claim 1, claim 2, claim 3 or claim 4, in which said sections are formed by casting a molten metal.
