<ABSTRACT>
A continuously flowing glass stream (32) is conditioned and homogenised in a treatment section which extends from an inlet side (26) of a working tank or of a distributor channel to at least one removal point and in which at least one cooling zone (K) is situated, which is followed by at least one homogenising zone for the glass temperature. In the working tank or the distributor channel, the temperature is lowered from an inlet temperature T1 to an outlet temperature T2. In order to guarantee the conditioning and homogenising effect even at high flow rates, a flow cross-section of the glass mass with a depth/width ratio D/W of a maximum of 0.6 or 0.5 or 0.4 or 0.3 or 0.2 is set in the at least one cooling zone (K) of the working tank or of the distributor channel by means of at least one sill-shaped raised part (23a) rising from the floor (23), the maximum depth Tmax being 300 or 250 or 200mm, and, in the glass stream (32), in the total of all cooling zones, at least 50 or 60 or 70% of the temperature difference between T1 and T2 is removed.

Process for conditioning and homogenising a 
continuously flowing glass flow (32) in a treatment 

section (9, 10, 16), which extends from the entry side 
(26) of a refiner or a distribution channel (5) as far 

as at least one removal point (E) and in which at 
least one cooling zone (K; 6, 7, 8; 17, 18, 19) is 

located, to which at least one homogenisation zone 
(11, 12; 20, 21, 22) for the glass temperature is 

connected, wherein in the refiner or distribution 
channel (5), the temperature is reduced from an inlet
