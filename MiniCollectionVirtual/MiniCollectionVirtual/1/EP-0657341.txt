<ABSTRACT>
A rear frame for centre-pivot-steered construction machines is formed from planar elements (18,19) which extend in the longitudinal direction of the frame, form load-bearing components and are connected to one another by means of further planar elements (20,21,22,23,24) which run transversely to them. When assembled this results in a basic structure in the form of a closed box, or box which can be closed by means of assemblies, such as engine bonnet or driver's cab.
