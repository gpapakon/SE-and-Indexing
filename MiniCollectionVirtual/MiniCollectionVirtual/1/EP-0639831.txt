<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus of the present invention includes a main chassis to which a rotary head cylinder is fitted, and 
a sub-chassis which is connected to the main chassis in such a manner as to relatively approach and depart from 

the rotary head, has a pair of hub driving shafts, and is equipped with a plurality of guide rollers movable in a 
predetermined direction. A tape stored in a tape cassette loaded to the sub-chassis is pulled out from the tape cassette 

when the guide rollers are moved due to the relative sliding motion between the main chassis and the sub-chassis, and 
is wound on the rotary head cylinder. In this way, loading and unloading of the tape can be manually made.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording, reproducing, and
recording/reproducing apparatus suitable for use in recording, reproducing, and
recording/reproducing information on and from a tape-like recording medium housed
in a tape cassette.Heretofore, tape players for use as recording, reproducing, and
recording/reproducing apparatus with a plurality of guide rollers which can be moved
in certain directions to effect a tape loading operation, by pulling a predetermined
length of tape from a tape cassette and winding the tape around a rotary head
cylinder, and a tape unloading operation, by rewinding and storing the drawn tape
into the tape cassette, have been characterised by the fact that the guide rollers are
moved by drive forces produced by a motor. Rotation of hub drive shafts for
rewinding the tape in the tape unloading operation is also caused by drive forces of
the motor. EP-A-0,356,985, discloses such an apparatus, in particular, a recording-reproduction
system wherein a reel chassis provided with a pair of reel supports is
slidably mounted on a main chassis having a head cylinder.DE-A-3,701,159 is used for the delimitation of claim 1 and discloses a tape player in which tape guides are mounted on
a slider, which is manually activated by moving the cassette holder to the play
position. However the disclosed device only has two guides which have to carry out
all the functions normally provided by a series of specialised guides.EP-A-0,463,544 discloses a tape player in which means for moving a tape lid
are linked to the cassette holder.Since the tape loading and unloading operations of the conventional tape
players are carried out by the drive forces of the motor, the tape players have a large
number of constituent parts, are complex in structure, and difficult to be reduced in
size, highly costly, and have a high power requirement.It is therefore an aim of the present invention to provide a tape player which
can manually be actuated easily in tape loading and unloading operation without the
need for the drive forces of a motor, has a smaller number of constituent parts, is
simpler in structure, and may be reduced in size and cost.According to the present invention, there is provided:
a recording, reproducing, or recording and reproducing apparatus for a tape-like
recording medium housed in a tape cassette, comprising a main chassis with a 
rotary head cylinder mounted thereon, and a subchassis coupled to said main chassis
for sliding movement relative to the main chassis in directions toward
