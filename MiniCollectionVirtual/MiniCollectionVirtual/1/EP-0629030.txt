<ABSTRACT>
An electrical safety barrier which is adapted 
to pass a current returning from a hazardous area to a 

safe area but which will transmit negligible energy 
from the safe area to the hazardous area under fault 

conditions has in its return channel a fuse (F2), shunt 
diodes (22) and additional diodes (D3). These 

additional diodes (D3) are Schottky diodes positioned 
at the hazardous-area end of the return channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical safety 
barriers and particularly to shunt-diode safety 
barriers as used for example for protecting electrical 
circuits and apparatus located in hazardous areas. The present invention is particularly 
concerned with the diode return type safety barrier. 
This may be used, in conjunction with another safety 
barrier or power supply, where a switch in a hazardous 
area is required to control the operation of a load, 
such as a relay or other device, in a safe area. This application has been divided out of our 
application EP-A-0310281 which also describes 
electrical safety barriers. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved safety barrier which will pass a 
current returning from a hazardous area but which will 
transmit negligible energy in the other direction under 
fault conditions. This can be achieved by 
incorporating diode means within the return barrier. 
The return barrier can be used readily in combination 
with other barriers, and in practice often forms part 
of a 2-channel unit. Prior art diode-return safety 
barriers are known in which series diodes are provided 
at the hazardous-area end of the safety barrier. 
However, the disadvantage of having the diodes at the 
hazardous-area end of the safety barrier is that high 
power Zener diodes have been required. It is an object of the invention to overcome 
this disadvantage. In accordance with the present invention 
there is provided an electrical safety barrier adapted 
to pass a current returning from a hazardous area to a 
safe area but which will transmit negligible energy  
 
from the safe area to the hazardous area under fault 
conditions, characterised in that the barrier comprises 
a return channel from the hazardous area including 
shunt-diode means, fuse means and one or more Schottky 
diodes or diodes having a low forward voltage drop 
positioned at the hazardous-area end of the return 
channel. The use of Schottky diodes or other diodes 
having a low forward voltage drop is that the barrier 
drops less voltage in the loop. However, because 
Schottky diodes have a relatively low reverse voltage 
breakdown they must be positioned at the hazardous-area 
end of the barrier. In order better to illustrate the present 
invention reference is now made to the accompanying 
drawing, which is a schematic circuit diagram of an 
embodiment of safety barrier using Schottky diodes in 
accordance with the invention. In the embodiment shown in the drawing a 
switch 10 is located within a
