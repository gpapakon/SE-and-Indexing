<ABSTRACT>
A chopper-stabilized switched-capacitor filter (bk5) has a discrete-time 
sequence (bk16); and a discrete-time multiplier (bk6) connected to the 

dicrete-time sequence. The discrete-time multiplier receives an input signal 
(X), and multiplies it by the discrete-time sequence to produce a chopped 

input signal. A discrete-time filter (bk7) is connected to the discrete-time 
multiplier to receive and filter the chopped input signal, and produces a 

filtered output signal. The discrete-time filter may be a discrete-time 
high-pass or low-pass filter depending upon the desired function, e.g. 

low-pass or bandpass filtering function, of the chopper-stabilized 
switched-capacitor filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a switched-capacitor 
filter, and more particularly to a chopper-stabilized 
switched-capacitor filter. Switched-capacitor filters are very suitable to be 
implemented by IC (Integrated Circuits) technology, and thus 
have been widely used in VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) 
application products, especially for telecommunications. For 
example, they are applied to ISDN (Integrated Service Digital 
Network) U-Interfaces, 9600 MODEMs (Modem V.32, 9600 bps), 
mobile telephones, etc. Conventional switched-capacitor filters 
however exist several drawbacks. For example, when the switched-capacitor filters are used in 
low-pass filtering applications, the low-frequency noises, such as 
the l/f noise, the offset voltage of operation amplifier, the charge 
injection noise, etc., seriously contaminate the output signal. 
Thus, these low-frequency noises will limit the dynamic range of a 
switched-capacitor filter and its more advanced applications. To 
decrease low-frequency noises in a switched-capacitor low-pass 
filter circuit, two kinds of solutions have been proposed. One 
solution substitutes chopper-stabilized operation amplifiers for 
traditional operational amplifiers in the filters. Such a technique 
is described in the article of K. Hsieh et al., "A Low-Noise 
Chopper-Stabilized Differential Switched-Capacitor Filtering 
Technique", IEEE J. Solid-State Circuits, vol. SC-16, no. 6,  
 
pp.708-715, Dec. 1981. Another solution utilizes the known 
"correlated double sampling technique". Since these two 
techniques approach the problem from a circuit perspective, they 
only reduce parts of the low-frequency noises. In the other hand, when the switched-capacitor filters are 
used in bandpass filtering applications, they suffer from a high 
capacitor ratio problem, i.e. the capacitor ratio needed is very 
large. Further, since the bandpass center frequency is determined 
by the capacitor ratio and the gain of operational amplifier, the 
frequency response of the filter will be very sensitive to circuit 
components, so that the bandpass function of filters is easily 
affected by IC process variations. At present, there are two 
approaches to solve this problem. One approach proposes a very 
difficult filter design and a very special circuit method to lower 
its sensitivity to circuit components. Such a technique is 
described in the article of T. C. Choi et al., "High-Frequency COs 
Switched-Capacitor Filters for Communications Application" 
published in IEEE J.
