<ABSTRACT>
A stepper motor having an internally toothed ring 
gear (12) acting as a stator which is contacted by one or 

more pinion gears (18) supported by a carrier (20). The 
ring gear stator (12) is made up of several sets of 

teeth (14) which are separately magnetically polarized to 
move the pinion gears (18) about the ring gear (12). Three 

toroidal coils (28,30,32) are preferably provided to charge 
three different sets of teeth which are arranged in a 

repeating series of three about the ring gear (12). 
Alternatively, a linear actuator can be provided to provide 

a linear output. The teeth (14) may also include an 
individual coil wherein sets of teeth can be 

electromagnetically biased into a north or south polarity or 
remain neutral.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stepper motors and 
more particularly to orbiting gear stepper motors. Stepper motors, or rotary transducers, are used in a 
wide variety of products where it is important to control 
the rate of rotation and rotational position of a shaft or 
other device. An example of a prior art stepper motor or selectively 
positionable rotary transducer is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
4,358,694 to Grundland. The stepper motor disclosed in 
Grundland discloses a ring gear including at least one 
permanent magnet and a rotor which is rotationally moveable 
relative to the ring. An odd number of poles are provided 
on the rotor for selectively providing magnetic force to 
cause relative rotation therebetween. The magnet has a 
precisely machined inner wear surface which is rotated 
against the outer surface of the fixed stator. Teflon or 
oil may be used to reduce friction between the magnet and 
the stator but are not intended to interfere with the 
existence of an air gap between the stator and the rotor. Other approaches to manufacturing stepper motors 
include the use of permanent magnets or rare earth 
materials. Such materials add cost to stepper motor 
construction. Prior art stepper motors tend to be fairly large in 
size and limited in power output. Any air gap between the opposite poles in the magnetic 
circuit results in a reduction of holding torque of the 
motor. The attractive forces between opposing poles is 
significantly reduced as a result of the existence of an air 
gap in the magnetic circuit. According to the invention there is provided A stepper 
motor comprising: 
a stator gear having a plurality of low-reluctance, 
ferromagnetic, non-permanent magnetic teeth forming sets of 
pole pieces arrayed in an alternating pattern; means for inducing magnetic flux independently in each  
 
of said sets of pole pieces;  means for minimizing flux leakage between adjacent 
teeth;  a rotor including at least one pinion gear having gear 
teeth which engage the teeth of the stator gear such that no air gap is present between pole pieces of said stator gear and adjacent teeth of said rotor pinion gear in engagement therewith ; and  means for controlling opposed electromagnetic charges 
supplied to said sets of pole pieces forming teeth of the 
stator gear, said control means sequentially alternating the 
polarity of the electromagnetic charge supplied to said sets 
of pole pieces in a desired direction to cause the rotor to 
move in said direction and holding the rotor in place by
