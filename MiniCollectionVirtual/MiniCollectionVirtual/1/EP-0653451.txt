<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester.
More specifically, it relates to a copolyester which
contains a copolymer unit derived from 9,9-bis[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-fluorenes
and which is excellent
in transparency and heat resistance, has small optical
anistropy, is excellent in moldability and is suitable
as a material not only for engineering plastics but
also for optical equipments in particular.In recent years, a variety of components have
been copolymerized, or polymers have been produced as
wholly aromatic polymers such as polyarylate, for
improving heat resistance of polyesters. A polyester
from 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene has been also
proposed, while no proposal has been made for a
copolyester from 9,9-bis[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-phenyl]fluorene.That is, U. S. Patent 3,546,165 discloses
that a polymer from 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene,
terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid is obtained by
an acid chloride method thereof. For improving this
polymer in moldability, Japanese Patent Publication No.
22,931/1992 discloses a heat-resistant polyester from a
mixture prepared by mixing 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene
with terephthalic acid,
isophthalic acid and a fatty acid in a specific mixing
ratio. Further, Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication
No. 152,622/1988 discloses a process for producing a
soluble, heat-resistant polyarylate, and Japanese
Laid-open Patent Publications Nos. 192432/1982 and
292830/1987 disclose raw materials having a specific
viscosity for copolymers from mixtures of 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene 
with terephthalic acid and
isophthalic acid in specific mixing ratios. Further, a
polyester from a mixture of this 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene
with terephthalic acid,
isophthalic acid and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid is
also disclosed.However, for all the above polymers, 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene
is used as one of raw
materials, and the polymerization method therefor
requires special polymerisation conditions. That is,
differing from an aliphatic alcohol, 9,9-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene
is difficult to react due to a
phenolic hydroxyl group on each terminal thereof.
Hence, in the melt polymerisation method, reaction
conditions at higher temperatures are required, and a
polymer formed is likely to undergo thermal
decomposition to cause coloring and degradation in
quality. Further, it is generally said that, in a
polymerization method in which a dicarboxylic acid is
converted to an acid chloride and then hydrochloric
acid is removed in a solvent, it is
