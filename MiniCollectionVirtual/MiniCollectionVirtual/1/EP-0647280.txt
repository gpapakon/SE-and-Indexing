<ABSTRACT>
A method of synthesis of new and useful single-stranded DNAs which have a stem-loop configuration (ss-slDNA). The method is an  DOLLAR i (in vivo) or an in vitro synthesis. Replicating vehicles which produce these ss-slDNAs. The ss-slDNAs are described. Uses for these slDNAs are disclosed. They can be used for introducing random mutations, they lend themselves for replication by a variant of the PCR method. They can also be used for regulating gene function. Other uses are disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of pending application Serial No. 08/024,676
filed March 1, 1993, Ohshima etal., entitled "Method for Synthesizing Single-Stranded
Stem-Loop DNAs, the Products and Uses Therefor" which in turn is a continuation-in-part
of pending application Serial No. 07/753,111, entitled "Method for Synthesizing
Single-Stranded Stem-Loop DNAs, the Products and Uses Therefor". Both of these
patent applications (parent applications) are explicitly incorporated herein word for word
as if each had been fully reproduced hereinafter.The invention concerns the field of recombinant DNA. More particularly,
the invention relates to a method of synthesis of new and useful single-stranded DNA
which have a stem-loop configuration (ss-slDNA). The invention relates to an invitro
and invivo method of synthesis. Further, the invention relates to the replicating vehicle
which produce these ss-slDNAs. Moreover, the invention relates these novel structures
and discloses uses for these structures. There is described a method for amplifying ss-slDNAs
with or without genes encoding a target protein. Moreover, the invention
discloses a method for regulating gene function by the use of ss-slDNA. Duplication of part of the genome is known to occur via an RNA
intermediate which is reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse
transcriptase. For a review, see Weiner etal., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 55, 631 (1986). The
consequential reverse flow of genetic information is considered to have played a major
role in the evolutionary diversification of eukaryotic genomes. A similar mechanism may
very well have been responsible for genomic evolution in procaryotes in the light of the
recent discoveries of bacterial transcriptases. See Inouye and Inouye, TIBS, 16, 18
(1991a) and Inouye and Inouye, Ann. Rev. Microbiol., 45, 163 (1991b). Gene duplication
through cDNA synthesis by reverse transcriptase is believed to have played an important
role in diversification of genomes during evolution.The invention arose in connection with basic research related to genome
evolution. The synthesis of a unique ss-slDNA during plasmid DNA replication was
demonstrated. It may be speculated that slDNA production may be widely prevalent
during both procaryotic as well as eucaryotic chromosomal DNA replication. The
chromosomal genetic elements followed by IR structures may always be subject to
duplication into slDNA at a frequency depending on the stability of the IR structure and
the property of the polymerase(s).It has been shown
