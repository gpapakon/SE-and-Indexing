<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle front structure.   The front structure of the invention includes a main pair of members consisting of two main longerons (12) which are symmetric with respect to the mid-plane of the vehicle (1) and which are joined together by a main crossmember (15), the vehicle including a transmission (6) and a front suspension consisting especially of a suspension arm (8), characterised in that the main longerons are straight, pass beneath the cabin (16) of the vehicle and their front ends (12a) support lateral mounts (22) for the engine (motor) (5) as well as the inboard articulations (8b) for each arm. The invention is especially applicable to motor vehicles with an electric motor.

Front structure of an automotive vehicle in particular 
with an electric motor, comprising a main beam made fast 

to the passenger compartment of the vehicle and 
consisting of two main longitudinal members (12) 

symmetrical with respect to the middle plane of the 
vehicle (1) and connected by a main cross-member (15), 

the vehicle comprising a transmission (6) and a front 
suspension consisting in particular of a suspension arm 

(8), characterized in that the said main longitudinal 
members (12) are straight, extend underneath the 

passenger compartment (16) of the vehicle (1) and support 
at their forward end (12a) side attachments (22) of the 

motor (5) as well as internal pivotal connections (8b) of 
each suspension arm (8). 
Front structure according to claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises an upper beam (18, 19) made fast to the 

main beam (12, 15) and consisting of two upper 
longitudinal members (18) the forward ends of which are 

connected by a front cross-member (19) which only 
supports the radiator, the headlights (20) and/or the 

bumper (3) of the vehicle (1). 
Front structure according to claim 2, characterized in 
that each upper longitudinal member (18) is fastened with 

its rear end to the main cross-member (15) and in that a 
vertical bracket (13) connects the forward end (12a) of 

each main longitudinal member (12) to the corresponding 
upper longitudinal member (18). 
Front structure according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the suspension arms (8) are pivotally connected with 

their internal front end (8b) onto the vertical brackets 
(13).  

 
Front structure according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the suspension arms (8) are 

pivotally connected with their internal rear end (8c) 
onto a right-angle bracket (14) fastened onto each main 

longitudinal member (12). 
Front structure according to claim 5, characterized in 
that the main cross-member (15) is curved at its side 

ends (15b) and exhibits a concavity facing the rear of 
the vehicle (1), the said side ends (15b) being connected 

to the door feet (17) of the vehicle and the central 
portion of the said main cross member (15) being fastened 

preferably through welding to the main longitudinal 
members (12) at the level of the right-angle brackets 

(14). 
Front structure according to any one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the spacing of two main 

longitudinal members (12) is substantially equal to the 
spacing of the attachments (22) of the motor (5) so that 

the latter are fastened to the front end (12e) of the 
main longitudinal members (12) which has a U-shaped 

profile. 
Front structure according to any one of the foregoing 
claims, characterized in that the main longitudinal 

members (12) are bevelled at their upper front end (12a) 

to allow the passage of the transmission (6) in 
particular in the case of a frontal impact. 
Front structure according to any one of claims 2 to 8, 
characterized in that the upper longitudinal members (18) 

are connected to shock damping means (9) through the 
medium of supporting gantries (16a).  

 
Front structure according to any one of claims 2 to 
9, characterized in that the spacing of the main 

longitudinal members (12) is lower than that of the upper 
longitudinal members (18). 
Front structure according to any one of claims 2 to 
10, characterized in that the upper beam (18, 19) 

constitutes a shock absorbing structure formed for 
example of folds, of elastic means and/or made from a 

deformable light material. 
Automotive vehicle fitted with a front structure 
according to any one of the foregoing claims.
