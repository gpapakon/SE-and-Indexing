<ABSTRACT>
A digital signal phase adjustment circuit adjusts the phase of a data signal in relation to a first local clock signal having a frequency of f. Also provided is a second local clock signal with a frequency of Nf, where N is a positive integer greater than 1. An N-bit shift register (120), clocked by the second local clock signal, generates N phase signals that are enabled in rotating sequential order during non-overlapping time intervals. One of the N phase signals is selected by a multiplexer (130) and used as the enable control signal for a data sampling circuit that is clocked by the second local clock signal. The data sampling circuit samples and outputs the data signal only when the selected phase signal is enabled, thereby outputting the data signal with a selected phase relative to the first clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DATA TRANSMISSION DELAYING CIRCUIT USING TIME-MULTIPLEXED LATCH ENABLE SIGNALSThe present invention relates generally to digital phase delay circuits and particularly to methods and apparatus for adjusting the phase of a stream of data signals arriving at a destination circuit so as to synchronize the data stream with a local clock and/or to compensate for phase shifts caused by transmission of the data between circuits or systems.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn many cases, streams of data are transmitted from a source to a destination over a path in which the delays to which the bit streams are subjected cannot be accurately controlled. Variable delays are introduced not only by differing lengths of the signal paths, but also by variations in the signal drivers and in the impedance of the signal paths. In order for the receiver at the destination to accurately recover the data, the individual data bits must be sampled by a clock at the receiver. This clock can have the same frequency as the transmitter, but the transmitter and receiver will not necessarily have the same phase, further exacerbating the problem of correctly receiving the data.Some prior art phase adjustment circuits, such as the one shown in U.S. Patent 4,700,347, multiplex several delayed versions of the input data signal. The object of the present invention is to provide a phase shift or delay circuit with as few components as possible and which has high accuracy in terms of the amount by which an incoming data signal is phase shifted. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn summary, the present invention is a phase adjustment circuit that adjusts the phase of a data signal in relation to a first local clock signal having a frequency of f . Also provided is a second local clock signal having a frequency of Nf , where N is a positive integer greater than 1. An N-bit shift register, clocked by the second local clock signal, generates N phase signals that are enabled in rotating sequential order during non-overlapping time intervals. One of the N phase signals is selected by a multiplexer and used as the enable control signal for a data sampling circuit that is clocked by the second local clock signal. The data sampling circuit samples and outputs the data signal only when the selected phase signal is enabled, thereby outputting the data signal with a selected phase relative to the first clock signal.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSAdditional objects and features of the invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description
