<ABSTRACT>
A vibration testing apparatus which is minimized in size and 
capable of being assembled with ease includes a vibrating section (11), 

a vibration generator (10), and a transmitting section (21) for 
transmitting vibrations from the vibration generator (10) to the 

vibrating section. The transmitting section (21) is formed with a pair of 
opposed parallel pressure-receiving plates (23, 24) that are orthogonal 

to the direction of vibrations, with the vibrating section (11) interposed 
between the pressure-receiving plates. The vibrating section (11) is 

formed with pressure-bearing surfaces (14) in opposed parallel relation 
to the pair of pressure-receiving plates (23, 24). High pressure fluid is 

fed into clearances (16), defined between the pressure-receiving plates 
(23, 24) and the pressure-bearing surfaces (14), to form a static 

pressure bearing. The pressure-receiving plates (23, 24) are clamped by 
a connecting member (25) under a load whose value enables the static 

pressure bearing to function as a spring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vibration testing apparatus.A conventional vibration testing apparatus is described, for
example, in Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No. 152,580/1987 (JP-A-62-152 580, US-A-4 748 851).
In this apparatus, X-direction and Y-direction connection elements in a
hollow portion of a vibration section each have a multi-sided cross
section. Each connection element has a pressure-receiving surface
parallel and opposite an inner surface of the hollow portion. A pair of
pressure-receiving plates, parallel and opposite to a pair of pressure-receiving
surfaces, cooperate to define a space, which may be used as a
static pressure bearing. A plurality of connecting members interconnect
the pressure-receiving plates. A vibration generator is connected to the
pressure-receiving plates by a stiff transmission member that extends
through the vibration section. Oil is pumped into the space under
pressure, creating a firm but somewhat resilient connection between the
pressure-receiving plates and the transmission member. Thus the static
pressure bearings transmit vibration from the vibration generator to the
vibration section.In this prior-art vibration testing apparatus, the connecting
members must have sufficient strength to support all the forces that act
in the directions of vibrations. Therefore the connecting members must
necessarily be very large. Further, since the connecting members in X-and
Y-directions must vibrate independently of each other while
maintaining the same strength, their arrangement is complicated. A 
plurality of alternating connecting members must be employed, making
assembly of the apparatus difficult.Another drawback of the prior-art apparatus is that, since it has
no means to correct the gap in the static pressure bearing when it
changes due to changes in temperature, the static pressure bearing has
to be assembled with a large gap distance. Though the large gap
distance allows for such changes, it makes increasing the rigidity of the
bearing difficult.A vibration testing apparatus which is similar to the above and has the
same drawbacks, and which exhibits the features included in the first part of
claim 1 is known from JP-A-3-231134.It is an object of the present invention to provide a vibration testing
apparatus with increased rigidity to static pressure and thus improved vibration
characteristics.This object is met by the vibration testing apparatus defined in claim 1. The above, and other objects, features, and advantages of the
present invention will
