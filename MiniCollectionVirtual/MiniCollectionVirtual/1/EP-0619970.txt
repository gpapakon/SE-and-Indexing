<ABSTRACT>
A molded curtain attachment connector (4) for connecting 
a curtain hanger member (3) and the top edge of a 

curtain (1) includes a fastener member (42) having a fastener 
surface (43) releasably engageable with the fastener surface 

of a surface-type separable fastener member (11) attached to 
the curtain (1) along a top edge thereof, a hook member (41) 

integrally formed with the fastener member (42) and adapted 
to be attached to, and detached from, the curtain hanger member 

(3), and a blocking means (44) disposed at the opening (41a) 
of the hook member (41) for preventing another article from 

entering the hook member (41) through the opening (41a), the 
blocking means (44) being deformable toward the inside of the 

hook member (41) when subjected to an external force of a 
predetermined intensity. The molded curtain attachment connector 

thus constructed can be manufactured with high production 
efficiency, facilitates the curtain attaching/detaching operation, 

ensures smooth opening and closing operation of the curtain, 
and can be colored in various manners.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curtain attachment 
connector used for connecting a curtain hanger member, such 
as a curtain runner, and a curtain and the like. Most curtains used in hospitals or hotels are held on 
a lease and they are replaced and laundered periodically. To 
accomplish a curtain replacement work with high efficiencly, 
measures should be taken to facilitate the curtain attachment 
and detachment processes. Taking it into account, various 
attempts, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 40-27706 
and Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication Nos. 57-142986 
and 2-107387, have heretofore been made to facilitate 
attachment and detachment of a curtain relative to curtain 
runners mounted on a curtain guide member, such as a curtain 
rail or a guide bar. For example, a curtain attachment connector disclosed 
in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication No. 2-107387 
includes a curtain attachment portion formed integrally with 
a curtain runner, and one of two companion male and female 
fastener members of a surface-type separable fastener bonded  
 
to one side of the curtain attachment portion. The fastener 
member is forced into and out of engagement with the other or 
mating fastener member which is attached to the top edge of a 
curtain. With the curtain attachment connector, the curtain 
can be easily attached to, and detached from, the curtain runner. However, since the surface-type fastener member is 
formed by weaving or knitting, the disclosed curtain attachment 
connector can only be produced with limited efficiency and is 
unable to retain a desired degree of engagement force or strength. 
Those curtain attachment connectors disclosed in other Japanese 
publications also have a woven or knitted surface-type fastener 
member and, hence, they have the same difficulties as described 
above. With the foregoing difficulties in view, the present 
inventor has previously proposed an improved curtain attachment 
connector such as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open 
Publication No. 4-104909. The improved curtain attachment connector 
includes a plate-like fastener member molded of synthetic 
resin and having on its one surface a number of hooks arranged 
in rows and tiers, and an attachment portion composed of two 
metal wires detachably engaged at their front ends to hook the 
attachment portion on a curtain runner, the fastener member and 
the attachment portion being integrally molded by injection 
molding. The curtain attachment connector disclosed in
