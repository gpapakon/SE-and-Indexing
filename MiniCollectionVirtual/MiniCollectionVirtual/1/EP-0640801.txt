<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an atmospheric gas boiler, comprising a casing (1) which includes water-conducting flow and return connections (V, R) and has a combustion chamber (3) which forms the lower region of an outlet shaft (2) and in which an atmospheric gas burner (4) is arranged. The casing (1) is formed from two cast-iron side wall members (5) and at least one cast-iron intermediate member (6) comprising a shaft part (7) and a hollow extension (8') forming the rear wall (8) of the combustion chamber (3). The water-conducting extension (8') is at the lower end and the cast-iron side wall members (5) are equipped, in alignment therewith, with return-conduit pieces (14), and the water-conducting shaft part (7) is at the upper end diagonal to the lower return-conduit piece (14) and the cast-iron side wall members (5) are likewise equipped, in alignment therewith, with flow-conduit pieces (15). The conduit pieces (14, 15) are biased fluid-tightly against one another and respectively form the flow connection (V) and the return connection (R) of the water-conducting casing (1). The combustion chamber (3), which is bounded at the bottom by a floor (11) which does not conduct water, is equipped in the upper region, on the burner insertion side, with a detachable, heat-insulated combustion chamber closure plate (12), below which the connection plate of the gas burner is arranged.
