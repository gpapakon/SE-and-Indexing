<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package made of 
cardboard material and having an openable and closable 
spout, as well as a blank for making such a package. It is well-known to provide packages with a separately-made 
spout of metal material, in which case the spout 
is mostly covered by a glued covering paper in the unopened 
package. This prior-art construction suffers from several 
drawbacks, inter alia that the covering paper has to 
be removed or cut up before the package is opened for the 
first time. Also, recycling the package for environmental 
reasons is no easy procedure, since the metal part first 
has to be separated from the paper part. In addition, the 
making of the package is complicated by the necessity of 
supplementing the blank with the spout during the manufacture 
of the package. However, the prior art also encompasses packages in 
which the spout is formed from the cardboard material 
itself. Such packages and blanks are disclosed e.g. in 
US-A-2,634,897, US-A-3,184,137, US-A-3,204,250, US-A-4,111,351 
and US-A-4,194,677. Also these prior-art packages 
and blanks are impaired by several drawbacks. Thus, 
some of the packages are not especially well suited for 
holding free-flowing pulverulent or granular materials, 
such as salt, sugar, flour and fine washing powder, in 
which case the unopened package has to have an especially 
high tightness. Some of these prior-art packages further 
require that spout components be so punched in the blank 
that the latter is weakened or that it becomes very difficult 
to erect the finished package while maintaining a 
precise fit between the various spout components. US-A-2,634,897 thus discloses a package and a blank. 
In one embodiment, punching is performed in three different 
panels, which are then glued in overlapping relationship 
when the package is erected. In another embodiment, 
punching is performed in two end-wall panels glued in  
 
overlapping relationship. In both cases, the spout is so 
designed that the contents of the package may escape 
between the punched-out parts of the inner spout component 
and the punched-out side edges of the outer spout 
component. Another drawback of this prior-art construction 
resides in the large width of the spout components. As a 
result, the spout must, when formed in but two end-wall 
panels glued in overlapping relationship, be so oriented 
that the package has to be held in a laid-down position 
when the packaged goods is poured out. The need of orienting 
the package in this way
