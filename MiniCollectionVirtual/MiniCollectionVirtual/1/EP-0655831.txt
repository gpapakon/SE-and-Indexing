<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transconductance
amplifiers and in particular a differential
transconductance amplifier monolithically integrable with
CMOS technology.By using CMOS processes at present it is possible to
provided in a single integrated circuit complex systems
comprising both analog and digital parts.For the analog parts provision of valid operational
transconductance amplifiers (OTA) is essential.Indeed, these amplifiers are the basis for the provision of
many complex circuits such as filters or other circuits
with switched, coding, decoding, etc. condensers as
disclosed in the article of Senderowick et al. "PCM
Telephony: Reduced Architecture for a D/C Converter ad
Filter Combination" - IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuit -
August 1990, regarding to a more robust and cost-efficient
PCM telephone system. These amplifiers fall in the broader
class of operational amplifiers but are characterised by
rather high output impedance even with closed loop. For
this reason these amplifiers are particularly well suited
in structures with feedback and capacitive load such as for
example the above mentioned switched condenser circuits.
But for resistive feedback, because of the high output
impedance even higher feedback resistors should be used and
hence their use is not always possible.For some time there has been a considerable ongoing effort
to improve the performance of these amplifiers. On one
hand it is sought to improve their gain-band product,
output dynamics, supply disturbance rejection, noise and
output piloting. On the other hand it is sought to reduce 
supply voltage to make them equivalent to those of digital
circuits which, ever more often, operate typically at 3.3V
with minima of even 2.7V for battery supply.The first solutions used by those skilled in the art were
rather simple structures but did not offer high
performance, especially in terms of stability.To obviate possible shortcomings the structure represented
in FIG. 1 ("Design techniques for cascode CMOS op amp with
improved PSRR and common mode input range", Ribner -
Copeland JSSC 12/84). This OTA consists of a first
cascoded stage and a second gain stage. A compensation
capacitance, instead of being connected as in older
solutions between the OTA output and the first stage
output, is connected to the source terminal of an M5
transistor with grounded gate terminal acting as the
cascode. This simple variation considerably improved the
circuit. In this manner a zero to the right resulting from
the frequency analysis is taken to
