<ABSTRACT>
Device for protecting an opening such as a roller shutter (1) comprising a drum (4) driven in rotation by a motor unit (5) around which a shutter (6) or curtain is wound between at least two positions, and means (15) for controlling the position of the said shutter (6) which are fixed to the position of the drum (4). According to the invention, it comprises, mechanically coupled to the drum (4), at least one element (16) enabling the voltage and/or current to be varied at its terminals as a function of the position of the shutter, and means (17) which compare the signal delivered with at least two predetermined thresholds.

<CLAIMS>
Protecting device for an opening, such as a roller blind (1) comprising a 
drum (4) driven in rotation by a drive organ (5) about which rolls up, between 

at least two positions, a curtain (6) or an apron, and means for controlling (15) 
the position od said curtain (6) subjected to the position of the drum (4), characterized 

in that it includes, mechanically associated with the drum (4), at 
least an element (16) allowing to to cause to vary, at its terminals, the value of 

the voltage and/or the intensity according to the position of the curtain, and 
means (17) for comparing the signal supplied to at least two predetermined 

thresholds. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the element (16) is 
formed by a potentiometer (22). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the potentiometer 
(22) is a mult-turn potentiometer. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a set of 
gearings coupled to the axis (23) of the potentiometer (22). 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that it comprises means 
for putting out of gear the mechanical coupling line between the set of gears 

and the axis (23) of the potentiometer (22). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that it includes at least 
two comparators (30 and 31) respectively connected to a relay associated with 

control and supply means. 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the comparators (30 
and 31) are formed by operational amplifiers. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the means (15) for 
controlling the position of the curtain subjected to the position of the drum 

(4) are placed inside said drum (4). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the control means 
(29) are placed in an independent casing.
