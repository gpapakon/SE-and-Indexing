<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds that 
inhibit farnesyl-protein transferase and Ras 
protein farnesylation, thereby making them useful 
as anti-cancer agents. The compounds are also 
useful in the treatment of diseases, other than 
cancer, associated with signal transduction 
pathways operating through Ras and those associated 
with CAAX-containing proteins other than Ras that 
are also post-translationally modified by the 
enzyme farnesyl protein transferase. The compounds 
may also act as inhibitors of other prenyl 
transferases, and thus be effective in the 
treatment of diseases associated with other prenyl 
modifications of proteins. The mammalian ras gene family comprises three 
genes, H-ras, K-ras and N-ras. The Ras proteins 
are a family of GTP-binding and hydrolyzing  
 
proteins that regulate cell growth and 
differentiation. Overproduction of normal Ras 
proteins or mutations that inhibit their GTPase 
activity can lead to uncontrolled cell division. The transforming activity of ras is dependent 
on localization of the protein to plasma membranes. 
This membrane binding occurs via a series of post-translational 
modifications of the cytosolic Ras 
proteins. The first and mandatory step in this 
sequence of events is the farnesylation of these 
proteins. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme 
farnesyl protein transferase (FPT), and farnesyl 
pyrophosphate (FPP) serves as the farnesyl group 
donor in this reaction. The Ras C-terminus 
contains a sequence motif termed a "Cys-Aaa₁-Aaa₂-Xaa" 
box (CAAX box), wherein Cys is cysteine, Aaa 
is an aliphatic amino acid, and Xaa is a serine or 
methionine. Farnesylation occurs on the cysteinyl 
residue of the CAAX box (Cys-186), thereby 
attaching the prenyl group on the protein via a 
thio-ether linkage. In accordance with the present invention, a 
compound of the formula 
its enantiomers and diastereomers, and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and 
solvates thereof inhibit S-farnesyl protein 
transferase, which is an enzyme involved in ras 
oncogene function. In formula I and throughout 
this specification, unless otherwise specified, the 
above symbols are defined as follows:
 
   A₁ and A₂ are each independently H, alkyl, 
substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted 
cycloalkyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl;

G₂ is H, -C(O)OH, -C(O)NH₂, 5-tetrazolyl,
