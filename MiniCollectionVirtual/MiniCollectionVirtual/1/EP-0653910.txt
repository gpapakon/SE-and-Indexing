<ABSTRACT>
A method is described to utilize used open-cast lignite mines by installing greenhouses with technological products attaining water economy of 7-8 times, unlimited nutritional capacity by enclosing pesticides and nutrients in a system of resins so as to release elements gradually, and with addition of calcium carbonate so as to limit the creation of sulfiric acid by the action of ground bacteria without pollution of the soil and therefore of need to move the greenhouses. This constitutes an original solution of agricultural utilization of these toxic and infertile soils.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention describes a method of treating
lignite and coal fields resulting from the
technique of uncovering in order to make it suitable for
greenhouse cultivation. This method specifically
describes an original approach of introducing
technological products in those fields, which promote
water economy, water availability and nutritional
efficiency in the soils of lignite and coal fields after
extraction of the carbonaceous matter and of introducing
agricultural utilisation with massive operation of
greenhouses.Lignite and coal fields which result from the uncovering,
after the extraction of richer deposits and with rejected
earth stacked in heaps, form surfaces containing
carboneous matter which in general are not equilibrated
soils and do not show fertility. These soil surfaces from
uncovering and from rejected aggregates in heaps, contain
sulphur, usually in high amounts 0,5-3%. Sulphur
contained in such soil is converted very rapidly to
sulphuric acid through the oxidative action of
thiooxidative bacteria which oxidise sulphur.The soils of lignite and coal fields which are formed
with the technique of uncovering are considered
problematic and toxic and are treated internationally
with two technical solutions:
a. The solution of covering the fields with fertile
top-soil in a depth of 0.8 to 1.20 m which is a very
expensive and laborious approach, which,
in spite of these difficulties, is the technical solution
in application today.b. The solution of removing the top-soil before the
uncovering technique of the carbonaceous deposit. Top-soil
is collected in rolls and is kept in covered
shelters until the field deposits are exhausted; then it
is placed on the surface of the resulting field. This
solution is technically and ecologically correct;
however, it is not followed in practice because it is a
solution of high sensitivity and of high cost.Thus, the restoration of the soils resulting after mining
carbon, lignite or peat deposits is difficult. To improve
restoration of fertile soils is a problem in need of a
solution since those fields do not improve naturally.
These coal or lignite fields, apart from the above, face
problems because of soil instability and of inability to
retain water. They are also charged continuously by urban
acid precipitates. In case of lengthy operation of
thermoelectrical plants, that charge may result to
neutralising all the alkalinity of the soil to form
acidic paths or areas.DE-A-4 105 595 discloses a method whereby mined soil is mixed with
pulverized calcium

<CLAIMS>
Method of treating a field from which coal or lignit has been mined in order to
make it suitable for greenhouse cultivation comprising the step of treating the mined soil by

mixing the soil with

a) a polymer which in soil retains water in high amounts, the water being
molecularly enclosed in that polymer, and the polymer advancing feeding by ion

exchange and absorption-desorption,
b) a composition comprising a fertilizer coated by a non water-soluble coating
and which is biodegradable in soil, and
c) pulverized calcium carbonate.
Method according to claim 1 characterized in that the pulverized calcium carbonate
is introduced into the soil in

quantity and depth so as to create safety in operations without risk for destroying the
plant production by acidic contaminates.
Method according to claim 2 in which 1 to 2 weight % of pulverized calcium
carbonate is introduced into the soil.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in that the polymer is
derived from recycled polymers and retains water up to 250 times its weight.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterized in that the fertilizer
comprises a coating composition which provides a biologically controlled release of

the coated content to the ambient environment comprising 60 to 97 weight % of one or
more waxy components and from 40 to 3 weight percent of a rosin mixture comprising

from 100 to 60 weight % of rosin having conjuguated double bond resinic acids in an
amount of at least 70 weight % and dimerized rosin.
Method of cultivation of a field from which coal or lignit has been mined comprising
the steps of treating the soil as defined in anyone of claims 1 to 5 and then cultivating

said field.
Method according to claim 6 characterized in that the cultivation is carried out in
green houses. 
Method according to claim 6 characterized in tat the green houses have heat
supplied by thermoelectrical plants in form of the cooling warm water of the plants.
