<ABSTRACT>
A sheet of the type which comprises a release base sheet and a thermal 
transfer image-receiving layer formed on the release base sheet and which is 

capable of releasing the thermal transfer image-receiving layer from the base 
sheet is described. The receiving layer is made of a dispersion, in a resin 

binder, of a layer compound capable of fixing cationic dyes through ion 
exchange reaction therewith. The receiving layer can be readily formed on a 

desired type of substrate by superposing the receiving layer on the substrate, 
after which the release base sheet is peeled off from the receiving layer. A 

thermal transfer image can be formed on the receiving layer by superposition 
with an ink ribbon containing a cationic dye and application of image 

information to the ink ribbon or by re-transfer of a cationic dye image from a 
printing paper. The thermal transfer image may be formed prior to the 

transfer of the receiving layer on the substrate. Owing to the fixing of the 
cationic dye through ion exchange reaction, the fixing properties of the dye in 

the receiving layer can be significantly improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for forming a thermal
transfer image on a substrate, the method comprising the
step of providing a printing sheet comprising an image-receiving
layer on which a thermal transfer image made of a
cationic dye has been formed.Sublimation transfer recording techniques have wide utility
in the fields where video image information is fixed, as a
thermal transfer image, on an image-receiving layer of a
material to be transferred. The material to be transferred
which is ordinarily employed is a printing sheet including a
substrate and an image-receiving layer capable of receiving
dye images thereon. Using this type of printing sheet, the
thermal transfer image is formed by procedures wherein the
ink layer of an ink ribbon having thermally diffusable dyes
such as disperse dyes therein is superposed on the image-receiving 
layer of the material to be transferred and heated by heating means,
such as a thermal head, in accordance with image information, thereby
causing the dye in the ink layer to be transferred to the image-receiving
layer.Recently, the images thermally transferred by the sublimation thermal
transfer techniques have been formed on various types of materials or
substrates. For instance, typical of such a material is a polyvinyl chloride card
(hereinafter referred to simply as PVC card) which has an image-receiving
layer consisting of polyvinyl chloride. The thermal transfer image is formed
directly on the image-receiving layer of the PVC card.Further, attempts have been made wherein a thermal transfer image has
been once formed on an ordinary printing sheet which has , on a substrate, an
image-receiving layer made of thermoplastic resins and the thus formed image
is re-transferred on a plain cloth such as of cotton. In the case, an adhesive
sheet made of a thermoplastic resin is sandwiched between the cloth and the
image-receiving layer of the printing sheet, followed by hot pressing by use of a
warm iron and peeling off the substrate of the printing sheet to re-transfer
the
image-receiving layer on the cloth. Alternatively, the dye image alone on the
image-receiving layer may be re-transferred to an adhesive sheet sandwiched
between the cloth and the printing sheet, followed by peeling off the printing
sheet to permit the thermal transfer image to be re-transferred on the cloth.However, when the image-receiving layer on the PVC card on which the
thermal transfer image has been formed is brought into contact with materials
having large amounts of plasticizers
