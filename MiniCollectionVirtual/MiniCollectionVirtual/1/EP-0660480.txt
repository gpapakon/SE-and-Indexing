<ABSTRACT>
The supporting insulator (6) has an insulator body (8) (to which a pressure medium can be applied and which consists of cured casting resin) and at least one cast-in fitting (11) to which high voltage (high stress) is applied and which passes through the insulator body (8). The metallic supporting body (12) has an outer surface (15). It is intended to create a supporting insulator which is of simple construction and is designed for comparatively high mechanical stresses. This is achieved in that the outer surface (15) of the supporting body (12) is provided with an adhesive layer (13) which adheres to the outer surface (15) better than the cured casting resin. The cured casting resin is crosslinked (wetted) with the adhesive layer (13).

Post insulator (6) having an insulator body (8), 
of cured cast resin, which can be subjected to a pressure 

medium, and having at least one potted fitting (11), 
penetrating the insulator body (8) and subjected to high 

voltage, which has a metallic support body (12) having a 
lateral surface (14, 15)
 
wherein 


the lateral surface (14, 15) of the support 
body (12) is provided with a bonding layer (13) 

which adheres better to the lateral surface 
(14, 15) than the cured cast resin,
 
and 
in that the cured cast resin is cross-linked 
with the bonding layer (13). 
Post insulator as claimed in Claim 1,
 
wherein 


an epoxy resin is used as the cured cast 
resin, 
 
and 


in that for the bonding layer (13), an 
adhesive based on epoxy resin is applied to the 

lateral surface (14, 15). 
Post insulator as claimed in Claim 2,
 
wherein 


a single-component adhesive is used as the 
adhesive. 
Post insulator as claimed in Claim 3,
 
wherein 


the epoxy resin single-component adhesive is 
cured after application to the lateral surface 

(14, 15) and before potting the potted fitting 
(11). 
Post insulator as claimed in Claim 1,
 
wherein 


the lateral surface (14, 15) is sandblasted 
and cleaned with a grease solvent before application 

of the bonding layer (13) 
Post insulator as claimed in Claim 1,
  
 

wherein 

the lateral surface (14, 15) is treated with 
chromo/sulphuric acid before application of the 

bonding layer (13). 
Post insulator as claimed in Claim 2,
 
wherein 


the adhesive based on epoxy resin is doped 
with a conducting or semiconducting powder. 
Post insulator as claimed in Claim 1,
 
wherein 


the bonding layer (13) has a thickness of 
from 0.05mm to 0.1 mm.
