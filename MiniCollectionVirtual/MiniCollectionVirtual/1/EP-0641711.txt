<ABSTRACT>
A display apparatus for a bicycle having a speed changer includes a display 
(10) switchable between a running mode for displaying running information 

such as time, running speed or running distance, and a shifting mode for displaying 
shifting information such as a speed stage of the speed changer; a switch and 

sensors (7a, 7b, 17) for generating a command to switch the display from the 
running mode to the shifting mode; and an automatic mode change device (12a, 

12f) for automatically switching the display from the shifting mode to the 
running mode. The automatic mode change device includes a control unit (12a) 

and a timer (12f). The control unit transmits the shifting information in place of 
the running information to the display device in response to a signal from the 

sensor or switch. The timer starts measuring time in response to the signal from 
the sensor or switch. Upon lapse of a predetermined time (t), the control unit 

transmits the running information in place of the shifting information to the 
display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display apparatus
for a bicycle having a speed changer. Specifically, the
display apparatus has a display device switchable
between a running mode for displaying running information
such as time, running speed or running distance,
and a shifting mode for displaying shifting information
such as a speed stage of the speed changer. The display
apparatus also has a switch for generating a command
to switch the display device from the running
mode to the shifting made.A conventional display apparatus for a bicycle as
noted above is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication
Kokai No. 57-198185,
being equivalent to US-A-4,490,127, for example.This apparatus
has a numeric display device, and a plurality of key
switches for switching information shown on the display
device. When a selected one of the key switches is
depressed, the display device is switched to a running
mode to provide a digital display of running information
such as running speed or running time, or to a shifting
mode to display shifting information such as a speed
stage. From the shifting information given on the display
device the cyclist can ascertain a current shift position
of the speed changer to effect a shifting operation correctly.
The running information displayed allows the
cyclist constantly to check a current running speed, or a
running distance or running time from a starting point.
Thus, the cyclist may pedal the bicycle while constantly
adjusting the running speed or running distance, or an
expected time of arrival at the destination, or a difference
between these specifics and a schedule or target.With the conventional apparatus, it is necessary,
after a shifting operation is effected with the display
device switched to the shifting mode to provide shifting
information, to switch the display device from the shifting
mode to the running mode to display running information
in place of the shifting information. That is, each
time a shifting operation is completed, the cyclist must
take the trouble of effecting a switching operation to
reinstate the display device in the running mode.In US 48 59 984 a display apparatus for a bicycle is
disclosed having a display panel provided on a handlebar.
The display apparatus is connected with the shift
levers via a plurality of wires which are capable to determine
the selected gear. The disclosed shifting apparatus
cannot be switched to different display modes in
order to show the cyclist different information.The Japanese publication Kokai no. 4-116417
