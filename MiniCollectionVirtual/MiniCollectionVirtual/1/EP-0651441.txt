<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device with a semiconductor body (3) comprising a 
surface region (5) of a first conductivity type which adjoins a surface (4) and in which a 

field effect transistor (1) with insulated gate (6) is provided. The field effect transistor 
(1) comprises source and drain regions (7, 8, respectively) of the second, opposed 

conductivity type situated in the surface region (5), and a channel region (9) of the first 
conductivity type situated between the source and drain regions. A metal gate electrode 

(6) separated from the channel region (9) by an insulating layer (10) is provided over 
the channel region (9) and is provided with a protection device (2) against excessive 

voltages applied to the gate electrode (6).
 

According to the invention, the surface (4) of the semiconductor body (3) is provided 
with a locally recessed field oxide (15), and the protection device (2) comprises a lateral 

bipolar transistor with collector and emitter regions (16, 17, respectively) of the second 
conductivity type which are more strongly doped than the surface region (5) and which 

adjoin the surface (4) and the field oxide (15), and with a base region (18) of the first 
conductivity type which is more strongly doped than the surface region (5) and which 

lies below the field oxide (15), the collector region (16) being electrically connected to 
the gate electrode (6) and the emitter region (17) being electrically connected to the 

source region (7).
 

It is achieved thereby that the field effect transistor (1) can switch high frequencies 

much more quickly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device with a semiconductor 
body comprising a surface region of a first conductivity type which adjoins a surface 
and in which a field effect transistor with insulated gate is provided, with a source and a 
drain region of the second, opposed conductivity type in the surface region and a 
channel region of the first conductivity type situated between the source region and 
drain region, while a metal gate electrode situated above the channel region is separated 
from the channel region by an insulating layer and is provided with a protection device 
against excessive voltages provided with two pn junctions. In such a semiconductor device, the gate electrode together with the 
channel region forms an input capacitance with the insulating layer as a dielectric. This 
input capacitance is charged or discharged during switching of the device. Owing to the 
use of a metal gate electrode with a low electrical resistance (R), charging or 
discharging of this capacitance (C) can take place very quickly. The device has a low 
so-called RC constant. Such a device, accordingly, is highly suitable for use at high 
frequencies above approximately 500 MHz. The protection device makes sure that high 
interference voltages applied to the gate electrode, which are practically unavoidable in 
practice, do not lead to a breakdown of the insulating layer. US Patent no. 3,648,129 (Figs. 5, 6 and 7) discloses a device of the kind 
mentioned in the opening paragraph in which the pn junctions in the protection device 
form a double diode connected back-to-back. The double diode comprises a first diode 
zone (7) of the second conductivity type adjoining the surface (11) and laterally 
surrounded by a second diode zone (6) of the first conductivity type, which also adjoins 
the surface. Adjoining the surface and fully surrounded by the first diode zone (7), there 
is a third diode zone (22) of the first conductivity type. For reference numerals, see 
Fig. 6 in US 3,648,129. The double diode is formed by pn junctions between the first 
diode zone (7) on the one hand and the second and third diode zones (6, 22) on the 
other hand. The third diode zone (22) is connected to the gate electrode and the second  
 
diode zone (6) to the source electrode of the field effect transistor. A back-to-back 
double diode is thus formed which is situated between the gate electrode and the source 
of the field effect transistor. The double diode breaks down both at positive and at 
negative interference
