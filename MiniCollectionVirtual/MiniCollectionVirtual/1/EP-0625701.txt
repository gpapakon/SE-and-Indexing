<ABSTRACT>
A force detector is comprised of resistance elements 
having a piezo resistance effect such that electric 

resistance varies due to mechanical deformation, and 
formed on a single crystal substrate (10), and a strain 

generative body (20) having a supporting portion (21) and 
a working portion (23), thus allowing the resistance 

elements to produce a mechanical deformation on the basis 
of a displacement with respect to the supporting portion 

of the working portion. This force detector can detect a 
force applied to the working portion as changes in 

resistance values of the resistance elements. The plane 
on which resistance elements are to be formed on the 

single crystal substrate is selected so that piezo 
resistance coefficients in two directions perpendicular 

to each other exhibit peak.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a force detector using a 
resistance element, and an acceleration detector and a 
magnetism detector to which the force detector is 
applied, and more particularly to a detector capable of 
detecting force, acceleration and magnetism respectively 
applied in independent directions in the three-dimensional 
coordinate system. In the case of detecting a force applied in a three-dimensional 
space, there occurs a need to independently 
detect respective axial components of the applied force 
in the three-dimensional coordinate system expressed by 
three axes of X, Y and Z. Conventional force detectors 
generally used convert a stress-strain resulting from an 
applied force to a quantity of electricity using a strain 
gauge, etc. to thereby conduct a detection. Ordinarily, 
there are many instances where a strain gauge is stuck on 
a strain generative body processed in three dimensions to 
detect stress-strain in respective directions of X, Y and 
Z axes of the strain generative body to thereby make a 
detection of force. In various industrial equipments with motion 
including robot, detection of acceleration in the three-dimensional 
coordinate system is required. Namely, there 
occurs a need to independently detect respective axial 
direction components of acceleration in the three 
dimensional coordinate system represented with three axes  
 
of X, Y and Z. Conventional acceleration detectors 
generally used convert a stress-strain resulting from an 
acceleration to a quantity of electricity using a strain 
gauge to thereby conduct a detection. Ordinarily, there 
are many instances where a strain gauge is stuck on a 
structure of a cantilever to make a detection of 
acceleration in a specified direction by a strain due to 
stress of the cantilever in the same manner as in the 
above-described force detector. However, the above-described conventional force 
detector and acceleration detector have the problem that 
the structure is complicated and is therefore not 
suitable for mass production. For example, three sets of 
cantilevers must be combined in three dimensions in order 
to detect three axial direction components in an 
apparatus using a structure of cantilever. Accordingly, 
there occurs the problem that such an apparatus is not 
suitable for mass production and becomes costly. 
Further, because a sensor such as a strain gauge is used 
in prior art apparatus, there is the problem that 
measurement accuracy is low. On one hand, Hall element and magneto-resistance 
effect
