<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the transmission of data signals between a fixed device (3) and a vehicle device (4), in which the data signals are transmitted in amplitude-modulated form, signal interruptions are prevented through multipath propagation by transmitting the data signals (ASK) with circular polarised waves, by using receiving devices for different received wave polarisations in the vehicle device (4) and by separately demodulating and subsequently adding together the signals of the receiving devices.

<CLAIMS>
Method for transmitting data signals between a
fixed device (3) and a vehicle device (4), in which the

data signals are transmitted in amplitude-modulated
form, 
characterized in that
 the data signals are
transmitted with circular-polarized waves, 
in that

receivers for different polarizations of the received
waves are used in the vehicle device (4), and 
in that

the signals of the receivers are demodulated separately
and subsequently added.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized by

the use of receiving systems (5 to 8) for circular
polarization both for copolarized and for cross-polarized

waves.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
by
 the use of receiving systems (17 to 19) for linearly
polarized waves which are orthogonal to one another.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the differently polarized waves
are received with a single antenna element (5, 5', 17,

17').
Vehicle device for receiving circular-polarized
waves which are transmitted by a fixed device (3) and

amplitude-modulated with data, 
characterized by
 a
receiver (5 to 8; 17 to 19) for different polarizations

of the received waves, by demodulators (11, 12),
connected to the receivers, for the different

polarizations, and by a summing stage (15) which is
connected to the outputs of the demodulators (11, 12). 
Vehicle device according to Claim 5,

characterized in that
 the receiver (5 to 8; 17 to 19)
has a strip-conductor antenna element (5, 5', 17, 17')

for receiving waves with different polarizations, from
which strip-conductor antenna element (5, 5', 17, 17')

the differently polarized received signals can be
tapped in a spatially separated fashion.
Vehicle device according to Claim 6,

characterized in that
 a 90Â° hybrid (8) is connected to
the strip-conductor antenna element (5, 5', 17, 17').
