signals comprising: 


a comparator (12) connected between the converter (2) and 
the output stage (20); 
a control and monitoring circuit means (15) linked 
operatively to the comparator (12) output; and 
plural switch means (9,18,19,23,24) associated with the 
input side of the converter (2), as well as with the 

current sensor (30) and the output stage (20), being linked 
operatively to respective outputs of the circuit means (15) 

to reverse polarity of the line (3) supply upon a 
predetermined threshold value for the comparator (12) being 

exceeded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an interface integrated circuit 
for driving telephone subscriber lines, being of a type 
which comprises a line current sensor and a phase 
converter, both associated with an output stage connected 
to the telephone line. The invention is related in particular to the field of 
telephone circuitry which interface the lines connected to 
telephone subscriber apparatuses with a central station. There exists a demand in this specific field to improve the 
quality of the communications over the telephone lines and, 
at the same time, to expand the range of services offered 
to the users. In this respect, it can be mentioned that token-operated 
apparatuses installed in public telephone boxes produce 
noise (spurious signal) in the audio band each time that a 
token is accepted, this is due to a reversal of the 
polarity brought about at the line ends. Furthermore, in recent years, complex telephone services, 
such as "videotel", are gaining widespread acceptance which 
involve transmission of trains of digital information over 
the telephone lines. To fill such increasingly more sophisticated demands, a 
constant effort to improve the quality of transmission over 
telephone lines has become mandatory. This effort 
concentrates, on the one side, on improving the structural 
quality of each line or of the telephone network as a 
whole. In fact, many national telephone companies are known 
to be involved in restoring their telephone networks  
 
through the use of fiber optics. On the other side, the improvement effort is directed 
toward the suppression of any noise in the audio band as 
well as the interferences with the band employed for 
transmitting digital information. To that aim, the attention has been focused on the circuit 
devices which operate to interface the telephone subscriber 
lines. For example, it is a well-recognized fact that a controlled 
or "soft" reversal in the supply polarity to the telephone 
subscriber line could ensure suppression of the aforesaid 
noise. "Polarity reversal" or "battery reversal" means here to 
exchange the polarities of the TIP and RING wires in a two-wire 
telephone line. In other words, to reverse polarity is 
to cause the TIP wire to take the voltage of the RING wire, 
and vice versa. It would indeed be appreciated if the 
interfacing telephone circuit connected to the line could 
perform a soft reversal of the supply polarity to the line. However, interface telephone circuits have been implemented 
heretofore by integrated circuits
