<ABSTRACT>
A prosthetic element (1; 2) for small joints, especially metacarpo-phalangeal or interphalangeal joints, comprises three separate parts: a head (4;6) with convex or concave sliding-articulation surface, an intradiaphyseal tail (3; 8) and a stem (5; 7) rigidly joining the head and the tail internally to them. Two such elements, having heads with complementary convex (41) and concave (61) spherical surfaces constitute one prosthesis. With a small number of each of the six separate parts (3 to 8), the surgeon selects them and constructs the desired prosthesis as a function of the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the patient, from among a very high number of possible prostheses.

Prosthesis component (1;2) for small joints 
comprising a head (4;6), an intramedullary stem (3;8) 

which are two separate parts and a stabilizing means 
(36, 42 ; 86, 62) for rotationally stabilizing the 

head (4;6) relative to the intramedullary stem (3;8) 
to which it is connected, characterized in that it 

comprises
 
   a substantially cylindrical connecting rod (5;7) 

extending wholly within the head and the 
intramedullary stem and having ends (53, 52 ; 73, 72) 

which are removably and rigidly connected to the head 
and the stem in holes (44, 37 ; 64, 87) provided in 

the head and the intramedullary stem. 
Prosthesis component according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the head (4;6) has a 

substantially spherical exterior surface (41;61) 
convex or concave which is offset relative to a 

longitudinal axis (I-I, II-II) of the intramedullary 
stem (3;8). 
Prosthesis component according to claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the stabilizing means 

comprises a complementary tenon (36;86) and groove 
(42;62) assembly. 
Prosthesis component according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 

intramedullary stem (3;8) has an oval transverse 
cross-section. 
Prosthesis component according to any one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the  

 
intramedullary stem (3;8) is made of plastic 

material. 
Prosthesis component according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the connecting 

rod (5;7) is made of metal. 
Prosthesis component according to any one of 
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the head (6) has 

a substantially hemispherical concave joint surface 
(61) delimited by a dorsal abutment (612) and two 

lateral abutments (611). 
Prosthesis for small joint comprising a first 
prosthesis component (1) according to any one of 

claims 1 to 6 and a second prosthesis component (2) 
according to any one of claims 1 to 7, the head (4) 

of the first component having a convex surface (41), 
a part of which is complementary from a concave 

surface (61) of the head (6) of the second component. 
Prosthesis according to claim 8, in which one 
of the heads (4,6) is made of metal and the other 

head is made of plastic material. 
Prosthesis according to claim 8 or 9, in 
which the connecting rods (5;7) of the first and 

second components (1;2) are identical.
