<ABSTRACT>
By means of a sealing system (1) for components, such as casings, containers and especially cable sleeves, which are to be sealed with regard to each other, and as protection of the internal space of the component against environmental influences, a solution is to be created with which, avoiding the disadvantages of known solutions, a sealing system is brought about which is simple to use and can tolerate alternating loadings without problems. This is achieved in that the seal (1) is formed of a first element (2) with an adhesive external surface (2a) and springy and/or elastic second element (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
Seal made of a cross-linked elastomerThe invention relates to a sealing system of the type set out in the principal section of claim 1.Providing casings, containers etc., more particularly cable sleeves, the internal space of which must be protected as durably as possible against environmental influences, especially dampness, with seals is familiar, at least where casing closing elements, such as doors and lids are present or where elements enter the casings, such as incoming and outgoing cables in the case of cable sleeves. In the older solutions it was known to apply an insulating mass in excessive quantities to the cable input area, which generally as a result of two separate casing halves was designed separately, in order to ensure that during pressing together of the sleeve halves the insulating mass surrounds the incoming cable and completely seals it. One problem of such compressing agents, for example those based on butyl rubber, is often that such components are subjected to strong temperature change loadings, whereby as a result of different thermal expansion coefficients and different heat transfer values between the sealing surfaces and the sealing mass during such temperature change loadings, leakages occur. In order to avoid such problems, so-called shrink-on sleeves were developed, whose cable input connections shrink when heat is applied and adhere tightly to the incoming cable casing, whereby hot-melt adhesive coatings ensure the necessary adhesion. Although this technology has considerable advantages, one of its disadvantages is that a flame always has to be used for shrinking, which often leads to local problems on site.The aim of the invention is to create a solution, which avoiding the disadvantages of the known solutions produces a sealing system which is simple to use and can take up the alternating loadings without problem.With a sealing system of the type described above, this task is 

solved by the invention in that the seal is formed of a first element having an adhesive external surface and a springy or elastic second element. By way of the sealing element which has an elastic or springy effect, it is possible to intercept or byÂ¬ pass various expansion paths in temperature variations, while through the other, adhesive, element adhesion to the component surface is ensured which is allocated to the seal or the corresponding seal surface. The elasticity on the one hand and adhesiveness on the other also result in the seal being pressed into uneven areas, thus increasing the
