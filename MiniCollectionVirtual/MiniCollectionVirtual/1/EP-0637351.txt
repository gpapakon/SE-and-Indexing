<ABSTRACT>
A wood-free white paper product has a pulp component which comprises 10 to 100 %, by weight, of bleached cellulosic fibers consisting essentially of recycled fibers of old corrugated containers; typically the bleached fibers have a viscosity of at least 10 cps, a brightness of 80 to 89 ISO and a tensile breaking strength of about 5 to 7 km; it was completely surprising that a pulp of recycled old corrugated containers would have characteristics and quality such that it might be employed as the sole pulp in the manufacture of wood-free white paper products; the white paper products include fine papers used for printing and writing, tissue papers and white paper layers employed as liners in food grade board in packaging for foods.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a 
cellulose fiber pulp produced 
by recycling waste corrugated 
paperboard; the invention also relates to wood-free 
white paper containing fibers of recycled old corrugated 
containers and a process for producing the 
wood-free white paper and the wood-free pulp. Paperboard, including corrugated paperboard, 
is widely used in packaging; millions of tons 
of used paperboard are discarded annually, and more 
than 70% of such discarded waste in Canada goes to 
landfill sites. Processes have been proposed to recycle at 
least a portion of such waste paperboard primarily 
for use with virgin pulp. Prior processes involve 
cleaning to remove non-wood contaminants and repulping 
to form a brownstock which is then mixed with 
virgin pulp for making linerboard or corrugating 
medium for use in corrugated paperboard. The quality of the re-pulped fibers is 
lower than that of comparable virgin pulp fibers and 
thus it is usual to use the re-pulped fibers only in 
admixture with higher quality virgin fibers, or to 
employ chemical additives such as resin or starch to 
compensate for the inferior quality of the re-pulped 
fibers. The inferior quality of re-pulped fibers as 
compared with comparable virgin pulp fibers arises  
 
from the processing to which the fibers were subjected 
during the original paperboard manufacture, and 
also to aging in the paper product. In US-A-4,737,238 recycling of 
waste paper containing aluminum is described in which 
an aqueous pulp suspension of the waste paper is 
screened and then dewatered to produce a white water 
stream containing most of the aluminum, whereafter 
the pulp is subjected to oxygen delignification. In 
CA-A-1,110,411 waste paperboard which 
contains wax and resin is re-pulped by immersing it 
in a weak sulphate black liquor at a temperature of 
65.5 to 93.3°C (150 to 200°F). to produce defiberization of the waste 
and separation of wax and resins from the fibers. Paperboard is itself typically produced 
from virgin pulp. The production of virgin pulp 
involves reacting or cooking wood chips with an 
alkaline cooking liquor at an elevated temperature. 
The cooking liquor may be a kraft, soda, alkali, 
sulfite or polysulfide cooking liquor, or a modification 
thereof, for example an anthraquinone modified 
cooking liquor. The pulp yield depends on the 
pulping conditions including reaction time, temperature, 
liquor type and chemical dosage, and can be as 
low as 50% to as high as 85%. Lignin is a component of the woodchips 
which is
