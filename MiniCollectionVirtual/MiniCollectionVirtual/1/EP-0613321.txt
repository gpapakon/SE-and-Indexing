<ABSTRACT>
A loudspeaker diaphragm is obtained with a 
fibrous material containing at least a kenaf fiber as a 

substitute for wooden fiber, the material being subjected 
to paper-making steps. The loudspeaker diaphragm thus 

manufactured with such non-wooden fiber can be made to 
closely resemble the one manufactured with the wooden 

fiber, to be light in weight, high in the rigidity and 
internal loss and still low in manufacturing costs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in a
paper-made loudspeaker diaphragm for use in
electroacoustic transducers.For the loudspeaker diaphragm, in general, it is
demanded to have such excellent solid state properties
that the density is small to be high in the elasticity, a
proper internal loss is provided, no mechanical fatigue is
provided while excellent in the weathering properties. While various ideas have been suggested
to use to satisfy the foregoing solid state
properties, a variety of high polymer materials, metallic
materials, ceramic materials they are all
troublesome in respect of the control of the foregoing
solid state properties and manufacturing complexity, and
are high in the manufacturing costs.On the other hand, the paper-made loudspeaker
diaphragm has been frequently utilized because of an
easiness of the control of the foregoing solid state
properties and of the manufacture. Dynamical properties
of this paper-made loudspeaker diaphragm are determined by
the solid state properties of single fiber employed, or by
coupling strength and coupling area between fibers.While wooden pulp has been generally employed as
the material for the currently employed paper-made
loudspeaker diaphragm from the viewpoint of costs, on the
other hand, the reckless deforestation is mentioned in
recent years as a problem in respect to the terrestrial
environmental destruction. Since in this case global
warming and desertizing phenomena can be prevented by
means of conservation of forest, it has become an
important theme to reconsider non-wooden paper resources.
For the purpose of the conservation of forestal resources,
therefore, it has been demanded to provide a substitute
material for wood so as to reduce the amount of wood used.In contemplating a remakable reduction in the 
amount of wood used for the purpose of the conservation of
the forestal resources taking into account the restriction
of the terrestrial environmental destruction, it may be
first mentioned to utilize reclaimed paper. However, used
paper is generally stocked outdoor so as to be
deteriorated due to such various factors as rainwater,
sunshine, decomposing fungi and so on, and the employment
of the used paper placed under such conditions involves a
problem particularly in respect of the obtainment of the high
rigidity when such paper is used for making the diaphragm,
and it is difficult to obtain a loudspeaker diaphragm
having uniform solid state properties.It is possible on the other hand to employ such
tubular fibrous bundle fiber as
