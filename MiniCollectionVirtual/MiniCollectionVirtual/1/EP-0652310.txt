<ABSTRACT>
An electronically controlled sample warper capable 
of warping yarns on a warper drum (A), with windings of the 

yarns neatly layered one above another in regular order, 
thus enabling the yarns to be readily rewound on beams on a 

weaving machine even when the warping length, i.e., the 
number of multi-windings is relatively large such as four or 

more windings. The sample warper includes a guide (G) 
operable to ensure that yarn for the "n"th winding is wound 

on the warper drum such that at the beginning of the "n"th 
winding, the yarn is placed ahead of an end of a winding of 

yarn formed on the warper drum by the "n-1"th winding.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronically controlled 
sample warper capable of warping yarns in orderly 
layered condition without regard to the warping length, 
thereby enabling warping of long samples or products manufactured 
in small lots. Conventional electronically controlled sample 
warpers are exemplified by Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication 
No. 62-62942, which generally comprises: driving and 
driven shafts 2, 3 projecting centrally from opposite ends 
of a hollow shaft 1 cantilevered at the driving-shaft side; 
a first small gear 5 loosely mounted on the driving shaft 2 
and fixed to a pulley 4; a second small gear 7 loosely 
mounted on the driven shaft 3 and fixed to a yarn introduction 
lever 6; third and fourth small gears 9, 10 mounted on 
opposite ends of an auxiliary shaft 8 extending through the 
hollow shaft 1 and meshing the first and second small gears 
5, 7, respectively, to cooperate with each other; drum 
frames 13, 14 mounted on the driven-shaft side of the hollow 
shaft 1 and each having an outer periphery having alternately 
an arcuate portion 11 and a straight portion 12; a pair 
of rollers 15 disposed one on the arcuate portion 11 of each 
of the drum frames 13, 14; and a warper drum A loosely 
mounted on the hollow shaft 1 and having horizontal drum 
spokes 16 carrying the rollers 15 around which conveyor  
 
belts 17 are wound. The conveyor belts 17 are simultaneously 
driven to a common amount of fine movement by a drive 
member 21 threadedly engaged with interior screw shafts 20 
of planetary gears 19 meshing with a sun gear 18 suitably 
driven from the exterior; as the sun gear rotates, the 
planetary gears 19 rotate concurrently. The distal end of 
the yarn introduction lever 6 is bent inwardly to provide a 
yarn introducing part 6' disposed adjacent to the front end 
of the outer periphery of the warper drum A. The warper 
also includes: a shedding means for forming a shed and a cut 
shed by selecting warp yarns (to be wound on the warper 
drum) over and under shedding bars and cut shedding bars; a 
total yarns counter count means for rendering an up signal, 
of a total counter for counting the total number of the warp 
yarns, to be on or off; a total yarns completion termination 
means for terminating the operation of the warper when the 
total number of the warp yarns reaches a predetermined 
value; a conveyor belt leftward moving means for moving the 
conveyor belt leftwardly; and conveyor belt rightward moving 
means for moving the conveyor belt rightwardly;
