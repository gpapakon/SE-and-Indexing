<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus includes an image member (2) 
supplied to the apparatus in an image member cartridge
 (3) and a 
transfer member (10) which engages the image member through an 

access opening in the cartridge. The transfer member (10) is driven by 
a motor (40; 212), which may be inside the transfer drum, in the image 

forming apparatus and in turn drives the image member (2) in the 
cartridge, eliminating the need for a separate driving connection 

between the image forming apparatus and the image member cartridge. 
The cartridge is mounted in the image forming apparatus by a pair of 

control surfaces (115) which are fixed with respect to the shaft (111) of 
the transfer drum along with extensions of the shaft (105) of the image 

member are urged by a spring (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming apparatus which 
uses a cartridge containing an image member on which transferable 
toner images are formed. U.S. Patent 4,876,577, Ogura et al, issued October 24, 1989, 
shows an electrophotographic apparatus which receives a cartridge 
containing a photoconductive drum. The cartridge includes both a 
charging mechanism for charging the drum and a cleaning mechanism for 
cleaning it. An access opening is provided for imagewise exposure of a 
charged surface of the drum to create an electrostatic image on the 
drum. The electrostatic image is toned through another access opening 
in the cartridge by one of two toning stations which are rotatable into 
position opposite the access opening to create a toner image. The toner 
image is transferred to a receiving sheet fed through a receiving sheet 
opening into contact with the drum. The receiving sheet is separated 
from the drum by a special mechanism which is part of the cartridge 
and fed outside of the cartridge to a fusing device. U.S. Patent 4,591,258, to Nishino et al, issued May 27, 1986, 
shows a cartridge containing a rotatable photoconductive drum with 
charging, cleaning and development stations also within the cartridge. 
An access opening to the drum permits transfer of toner images to a 
receiving sheet fed into engagement with the drum. Rotation of the 
drum is accomplished by a driving connection at the end of the 
cartridge which must mate with a drive member in the receiving 
apparatus. Projections are provided on the cartridge to prevent damage 
to the cartridge driving connection member from careless handling. Many other references show such image member cartridges, and 
they are used commercially in personal copiers and laser printers. In 
general, the photoconductive drum is driven by an end connection to 
the drum through an end of the cartridge. Mounting of the cartridge in  
 
the image forming apparatus requires assuring that the drive 
connection is effectively made. U.S. Patent 4,712,906, to Bothner et al, issued December 15, 
1987, shows a transfer drum for a color printer. In one embodiment, a 
series of different color toner images are transferred to a receiving 
sheet carried by the drum which rotates to repeatably present the 
receiving sheet to an image member. In another embodiment, the 
different color toner images are transferred directly to the outside 
surface of a transfer drum to create a multicolor image on the transfer 
drum which is subsequently transferred in a single

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus comprising: 

a replaceable cartridge (3) having a housing and a drum-shaped 
image member (2), a shaft (57; 105) supporting said image member 

for rotation about an axis of rotation (56), said shaft (57;105) 
having opposite ends which extend beyond opposite ends of said 

image member (2) and are accessible from outside of said cartridge 
housing, said image member (2) having an image surface upon which 

toner images are formable, 
a transfer drum (10) having an axis of rotation (53) and a cylindrical 
outer transfer surface for receiving toner images from said image 

surface, and 
means (52; 115) fixed with respect to the axis of rotation (53) of 
said transfer drum (10) for controlling the position of the shaft (57; 

105) supporting the image member to maintain the axis of rotation 
(56) of said image member parallel to the axis of rotation (53) of 

said transfer drum (10). 
An image forming apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said shaft 
(57; 105) is fixed with respect to said cartridge (3) and said image 

member (2) is mounted for rotation with respect to said shaft (57; 
105) and said shaft (57; 105) has opposite ends which extend outside 

of said cartridge (3) for engagement by said controlling means 
(52; 115). 
An image forming apparatus according to claim 1 or 2 and further 
including means (65, 67;120) for urging said cartridge toward said 

transfer drum (10) to urge said image surface into engagement with 
said transfer surface.  

 
An image forming apparatus according to claim 3 wherein said controlling 
means (52; 115) includes at least a pair of control surfaces 

(115), one control surface engaging each opposite end of said shaft 
(57; 105), said control surfaces (55; 115) running from positions of 

engagement of said control surfaces with the ends of said shaft (57; 
105) toward said transfer drum (10), and said urging means (65, 

67; 120) including means for urging said cartridge in a direction 
maintaining contact between the ends of the shaft and said control 

surfaces while also urging said image surface into engagement with 
said transfer surface. 
An image forming apparatus according to claim 1 to 4 wherein said 
transfer drum (10) is supported by a shaft (51; 111) having opposite 

ends, which ends are fixed with respect to said controlling 
means (52;115).
