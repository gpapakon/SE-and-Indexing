<ABSTRACT>
The alarm system has a number of outer stations communicating with a central unit by transmitting radio signals in a given frequency spectrum and contg. data telegrams representing detected conditions, evaluated by the central unit to activate the alarm. The transmission frequency of the outer stations is altered for each new information block, each of which is repeated a number of times, the central unit scanning the transmission spectrum and checking that all stations have responded within a given time frame and that a threshold transmission error rate is not exceeded.

Method of operating a radio alarm system, having a
radio link between the external stations and the central

unit of an alarm system, the external stations transmitting
in a specified transmission spectrum on a plurality of

frequencies and the radio signals containing data telegrams
that each represent an event and the central unit being

tuned to the radio signals of the external stations
belonging to the alarm system, characterized in that


the transmission frequencies of the external stations
are each altered after the transmission of one or more

information blocks, each information block being
transmitted repeatedly,
the centre scans the available transmission spectrum
and evaluates whether all the signalled sensors have

transmitted a signal within a specified time interval,
the centre continuously checks whether the error rate
in signals emitted does not exceed a specified value.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that,
within the available bandwidth, a specified number of

carrier frequencies is determined on which the information
blocks are transmitted and the time duration within which

transmission takes place on a carrier frequency corresponds
to the transmission duration of an information block or of

a multiple thereof.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the individual information blocks each contain a

synchronization block, a useful information block and an
error correction block.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that all the possible channels are

monitored consecutively in the centre.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that a plurality of or all the 

transmission channels are monitored in parallel in the
centre.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the change in the transmission

frequencies in the external stations and the sequence of
the monitoring operation are determined on the basis of the

random principle.
Radio alarm signal comprising external stations and at
least one central unit for performing the method according

to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized by means for
altering the transmission frequency of the external

stations after each transmission of one or more information
blocks, each information block being transmitted

repeatedly.
