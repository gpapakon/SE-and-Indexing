In a method for the definition of a call forward operation, within a
telecommunications system, for forwarding calls from an originator identifier

towards a destination identifier, a user (16, 17, 18), from a user terminal (141,

the system proposes a first default value of said originator identifier; the user
makes a first choice between validating said default first value of said originator

identifier and determining and then validating a first other value of said originator
identifier; the system proposes a second default value of said destination

identifier; the user makes a second choice between validating said second default

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is that of telecommunications systems.The invention can be applied especially to private automatic branch
exchange (PABX) and/or public automatic exchanges in telecommunications
systems.More specifically, the invention relates to a method for the definition of a
call forward operation within a telecommunications system.In general, a private automatic branch exchange (PABX) manages a
plurality of telephone sets distributed geographically within the premises of an
undertaking, where each user makes use of one of these telephone sets. It is
useful to be able to forward a call from one telephone set (known as the forwarded
set) to another (known as the destination set) so that the calls intended for the
forwarded set finally reach the destination set.Conventionally, two types of call forward function are available to a
telephone set user : a local call forward function and a remote call forward
function.In the first case (definition of a local forward function), the user, by means
of his telephone keypad, keys in a code associated with the local call forward
function, and then the number of the destination telephone set to which the call
must be forwarded. Thus, the telephone set on which the local call forward
operation has been programmed is the forwarded telephone set by default.
Following the above two operations, a call reaching the forwarded telephone set is
« rerouted » to the destination telephone set.In the second case (definition of a remote call forward operation), the user,
by means of his telephone keypad, keys in a code associated with the remote call
forward function and then the number of the originator telephone set from which
the call forward operation must take place (the forwarded telephone set).
Consequently, following this programming operation, a call reaching the
forwarded telephone set is rerouted to the telephone set on which the user has
programmed the call forward operation. In other words, for a remote call forward
operation. the destination telephone set is the telephone set on which the remote
call forward programming has been done.It appears that this solution presents several drawbacks. First of all, each (local or remote) call forward function requires the user to
have knowledge of a distinct code. Thus, to be able to perform both types of call
forwarding operation, two different codes are necessary.Then, it is not possible to program a call forward operation from a
telephone set that is not involved in this forward operation (namely a set that
