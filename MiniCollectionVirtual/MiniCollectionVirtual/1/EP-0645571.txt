<ABSTRACT>
Extruded pipe end made from polyethylene, which has a moulded-on socket. The extruded pipe end has a wall thickness of over 5 mm. The moulded-on socket has at least the same wall thickness. The wall has in cross-section a highly crystalline inner region (4) and a weakly crystalline outer region (5). The highly crystalline inner region (4) forms a peripheral crystalline supporting shroud. This is designed for the virtually deformation-free supporting of the weakly crystalline outer region when shrinkage stresses occur. A method for producing such a pipe end is also specified.

A pipeline end (1) produced from synthetic polyethylene material by extrusion, which 
comprises an integrally formed insertion socket (3), with the features 


a) the pipeline end (1) formed by extrusion has a wall thickness greater than 5 
mm, 
b) the integrally formed insertion socket (3) has at least the same wall thickness, 
 
and with the proviso that the wall (2) of the insertion socket (3), in cross-section, has a highly 

crystalline inner region (4) and a slightly crystalline outer region (5), and with the further 
proviso that the highly crystalline inner region (4) forms an encircling crystalline supporting 

arch and the latter is designed for supporting the slightly crystalline outer region (5) 
practically free from deformation when shrinkage stresses occur. 
A pipeline end according to claim 1, with the further proviso that the wall (2) of the 
insertion socket (3) has an upset texture. 
A pipeline end according to either one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the wall (2) has a 
wall thickness greater than 6 mm. 
A pipeline end according to either one of claims 1 or 2, wherein the wall (2) has a 
wall thickness greater than 10 mm. 
A pipeline end according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the insertion socket (3) 
comprises at least one region having an integrally formed seating groove (6) for an inserted 

sealing ring (7) and having a sealing chamber (8), and this region is also designed as a 
supporting arch.  

 
A process for producing a pipeline end comprising an integrally formed insertion 
socket according to any one of claims 1 to 5, with the process steps: 


a) the pipeline end is heated to within its softening range at the end at which the 
insertion socket is to be integrally formed, 
b) the end of the pipeline end which is heated to within its softening range is 
introduced into a pipe socket mould which comprises a heated mandrel and 

is unheated or cooled on the outside, 
c) simultaneously or thereafter, the heated introduced end is pneumatically, 
hydraulically and/or mechanically pressed so as to expand towards the inner 

wall of the mould cavity of the pipe socket mould, wherein a reduction in the 
wall thickness of the pipeline end is accepted in the region of the insertion 

socket, 
d) the end of the pipeline end which has expanded to the width of the socket is 
upset from the socket mouth, with an increase in the wall thickness which was 

reduced according to process step c), to produce the socket geometry which 
is predetermined by the pipe socket mould, and is thereby, and at the same 

time, pressed against the unheated or cooled inner wall of the mould cavity 
of the pipe socket mould, 
e) the temperature of the heated mandrel is selected, taking into consideration 
the outside temperature of the pipe socket mould, so that a temperature of 

the end of the pipeline end which is within the melting range is reached in an 
inner cross-sectional region of the insertion socket wall, which temperature 

drops to a temperature of the end of the pipeline end which is within the 
softening range at the outer wall of the pipe socket mould, 
  
 

wherein the holding time in the pipe socket mould of the insertion socket which is integrally 
formed in this manner, as well as the cooling rate of the integrally formed insertion socket 

inside or outside the pipe socket mould, are selected so that a highly crystalline inner cross-sectional 
region and a slightly crystalline outer cross-sectional region are formed and the 

inner cross-sectional region forms an encircling supporting arch which is designed for 
supporting the slightly crystalline outer region practically free from deformation when 

mechanical shrinkage stresses occur. 
A process according to claim 6, wherein a pipeline end, which is cooled after 
extrusion and sizing, is heated to within its softening range at the end at which the insertion 

socket is to be integrally formed. 
A process according to claim 6, wherein an end of the pipeline, which still contains 

residual heat from extrusion after extrusion and sizing, is introduced into the pipe socket 
mould, optionally after intermediate heating. 
A process according to any one of claims 6 to 8, wherein a temperature higher than 
125°C is maintained on the inside ofthe socket and a temperature appreciably below 125°C 

is maintained on the outside of the socket, due to the temperature of the heated mandrel. 
A process according to any one of claims 6 to 9, wherein the holding time in minutes 
ofthe moulded insertion socket in the pipe socket mould approximately corresponds to half 

the wall thickness of the integrally formed insertion socket in millimetres.
