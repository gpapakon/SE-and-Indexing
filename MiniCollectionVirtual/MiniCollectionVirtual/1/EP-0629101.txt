<ABSTRACT>
The hearing aid according to the invention consists of a skeleton which consists of an outer support element (3), an inner support element (4) and a connecting element (5) on which at least some of the electronic components (41, 42) of the hearing aid are arranged. The two support elements essentially form the end faces (IS, AS) of an irregular truncated cone. On the support elements, a diaphragm (2) is mounted in such a manner that it essentially forms the outer surface of the truncated cone. The diaphragm (2) and the skeleton (3/4/5) together form an essentially tubular moulding space in which a moulded body (1) matched to the individual auditory canal is cast in the ear of the user by means of a hardening casting compound. Before the casting process, the skeleton can be roughly matched to the individual auditory canal by appropriate deformation of the connecting element (5). The diaphragm (2) is permeable to gas but impermeable to liquid not only perpendicularly to its main surface but also parallel thereto, and it repels water and oil.

Hearing aid to be worn in the ear which hearing aid essentially corresponds to
an irregular frustum with an outer end face (AS), an inner end face (IS) and a

circumferential surface (M), which hearing aid comprises a skeleton with an
outer support element (3) and a connecting element (5), the outer support

element (3) forming the outer end face (AS) and having a pouring opening (34)
and the connecting element (5) connecting the outer end face (AS) with the

inner end face (IS), which hearing aid comprises electronic components at least
partly carried by the skeleton and which hearing aid is adaptable or adapted to

an individual auditory canal by means of moulding of a shaped member,

characterized in that
 the skeleton additionally comprises an inner support
element (4) forming the inner end face (IS) and that a microporous diaphragm

(2) is fixed to the support elements (3, 4) in such a manner that it forms the
circumferential surface (M) of the frustum and, for the adaptable hearing aid,

limits together with the skeleton (3, 4, 5) a moulding chamber and, for the
adapted hearing aid limits the shaped member (1) moulded in the moulding

chamber, wherein the microporous diaphragm (2) is permeable for gases in
directions perpendicular and parallel to its surface and impermeable for liquids

and wherein the microporous diaphragm (2) is oil and water-repellent for
maintaining the wearing comfort achieved by its porosity.
Hearing aid according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the diaphragm (2) is a
foamed and stretched PTFE material.
Hearing aid according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the microporous
diaphragm (2) is woven or knitted from plastic fibers and is coated with a water 

or oil-repellent layer at least on the side facing the auditory canal.
Hearing aid according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
microporous diaphragm (2) carries an intermediate layer on its side facing the

skeleton (3, 4, 5).
Hearing aid according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the intermediate layer
comprises an open-pore foam or a gauze.
Hearing aid according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
, in the case
of the adapted hearing aid comprising a shaped member, said shaped member

(1) consists at least partly of polysiloxane.
Hearing aid according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
, in the case
of the adapted hearing aid comprising a shaped member, said shaped member

(1) comprises additives for improving its absorbing characteristics.
Hearing aid according to claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the additives are foam
pieces or hollow glass balls.
Hearing aid according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the inner
end face (IS) is wholly or partly covered and/or the outer end face (AS) is

partly covered by the microporous diaphragm (2).
Hearing aid according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 at least
one of the support elements (3, 4) is designed as a capsule (3.1, 4.1) with a 

closing element (3.2, 4.2).
Hearing aid according to one of the claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that
 the
microporous diaphragm (2) is fixed to the support elements (3, 4) by welding,

by gluing or by a diaphragm fixing means.
Hearing aid according to one of the claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that
 the
connecting element (5) is plastically deformable.
Hearing aid according to one of the claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that
 the
connecting element (5) is hollow and that the support elements (3, 4) comprise

openings (35, 45) which, together with the cavity of the connecting element,
form a pressure compensating channel.
Method for individualizing a hearing aid according to one of claims 1 to 13,
wherein a hearing aid not yet comprising a shaped member (1) is positioned in

an individual auditory canal of a wearer and a hardening moulding material is
poured through the pouring opening (34) around the skeleton (3, 4, 5) of the

hearing aid positioned in the auditory canal, which moulding material hardens
in the auditory canal, 
characterized in that
 when filling the substantially
tubular moulding chamber limited by the skeleton (3, 4, 5) and the microporous

diaphragm (2), the diaphragm (2) is positioned against the wall of the auditory
canal, wherein air displaced by the moulding process from the moulding

chamber and from the auditory canal is at least partly removed through the
microporous diaphragm (2) being permeable for gases perpendicular and

parallel to its surface. 
Method according to claim 14, 
characterized in that
 prior to the moulding
process the hearing aid is roughly adapted to the individual auditory canal by

means of plastic deformation of the connecting element (5) of the skeleton (3,
4, 5).
