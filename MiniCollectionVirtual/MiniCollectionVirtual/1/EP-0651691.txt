<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for 
vibrating concrete, comprising an internal vibrator and 
a method for vibrating concrete using an internal 
vibrator (see e.g. CH-A-328693). In order to obtain homogeneous and non-porous concrete, 
concrete which has been poured into a mould is often 
subjected to vibration using an internal vibrator. An 
internal vibrator consists of a vibrating tube, the 
high frequency vibrations of which are often achieved 
by means of an internal rotating eccentric within the 
tube. When the vibrating tube is lowered into concrete, 
the concrete is subjected to very rapid vibration. In 
this manner, the internal friction of the concrete is 
to all intents and purposes eliminated, which implies 
that the concrete becomes less viscous, settles and 
compacts. The majority of the air which is trapped 
within the concrete and which for normal concrete 
consistencies can make up some 5-20 % of the total 
volume, is forced out of the concrete and thus a non-porous 
and homogeneous concrete is obtained. The low 
viscosity consistency of the concrete which is imparted 
by the vibrations further implies that the concrete 
will flow into any parts of the mould which are 
relatively inaccessible and surround any reinforcement 
which may be present. Since each percent of remaining air-filled cavities 
which occur due to insufficient settling of the 
concrete reduces the strength of the structure by 
approximately 5 %, it is immediately apparent that good  
 
vibration of the concrete is of utmost importance in 
order to ensure high quality of the concrete casting. Presently, vibration work is carried out using an 
internal vibrator which is manually inserted into the 
concrete in the mould to a certain depth following a 
predetermined pattern. Thereafter, the internal 
vibrator is very slowly pulled out of the concrete so 
that air-pockets will not be formed during the removal. 
Such work is clearly very time consuming and places 
high demands on accuracy and precision during its 
performance. In addition, the work is very heavy. 
Furthermore, once the work has been carried out, it is 
virtually impossible to check, and the consequences of 
insufficient vibration will not be apparent until the 
casting mould is removed or perhaps not before the cast 
concrete construction is loaded. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an arrangement and a method for vibrating 
concrete using an internal vibrator which overcome the 
disadvantages of manual methods
