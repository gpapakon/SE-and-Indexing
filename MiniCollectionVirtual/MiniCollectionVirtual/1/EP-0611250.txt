<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the extrusion of polymer compositions on the basis
of polyvinylchloride (PVC).The high resistance of PVC against combustion as well as its low price and
favourable processing properties are among the main reasons why this
polymer is still one of the most widely used plastics where an optimum
balance of price, processing ease, high strength and resistance to microbial
degradation is required, such as in weather-exposed construction
elements including tubings, panels and the like products.According to the state of the art PVC must be compounded with stabilizers
before it can be used for the manufacture of finished or semifinished
articles, such as by moulding methods that involve extrusion. As used
herein, the term "compounding" refers to a separate processing step in
which molten or thermally plasticized PVC (i.e. in a heated state) is
mixed with at least one constituent containing a stabilizing additive so
as to form an essentially uniform material which is solidified to form a
product that can be sold to the processing industry, e.g. in the form of
pellets or granules.Obviously, compounding of PVC involves a considerable energy consumption
and is a significant cost factor. However, previous attempts to avoid
compounding have failed and it has been generally assumed that compounding
is a sine-qua-non requirement of PVC production because otherwise the PVC
constituent would undergo substantial decomposition upon extrusion.Accordingly, it is a main object of the present invention to provide for a
method of extruding PVC-based compositions to form typical semi-finished
products, such as panels, that avoids the requirement of using a compounded
PVC as the starting material. Another object of the invention is a
method for continuous production of PVC panels (generally considered a
semi-finished material) that does not require use of a compounded PVC
starting material. A further object is a plant for extrusion of PVC-based
composition that will operate satisfactorily and yield high-quality PVC-based
products even though a substantially pure - i.e. uncompounded PVC is
used as the starting material. Applicant's EP-A-0 426 619 discloses a method of producing
remoldable panels from a high-melting (>150Â°C) polymer and
a thermosensitive filler by direct extrusion, i.e. without
first preparing a mixture of the constituents in a separate
step by using a co-rotating double-screw. The use of low
melting polymers is not mentioned in, and would be contrary
to, the aims of EP-A-0 426 619, and it is
