<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionANHYDROUS FORMULATIONS FOR ADMINISTERING LIPOPHILIC AGENTSTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to anhydrous formulations useful for administering lipophilic, pharmaceutically active agents to hosts in need of treatment, processes for preparing these formulations, pharmaceutical compositions based upon these formulations, and the use of these formulations to administer lipophilic, pharmaceutically active agents to a host. The lipophilic agent to be administered is solubilized in a hydrophilic vehicle which makes up at least part of the anhydrous formulation. Preferably, the lipophilic agent is present in the hydrophilic vehicle in a supersaturated or near saturated amount. Preferred pharmaceutical compositions based upon the formulations according to the present invention are useful in treating skin dermatoses such as psoriasis.Various methods are known for administering pharmaceutically active agents to a host in need of treatment. For example, such agents are often administered topically, parenterally, orally, ocularly, or nasally, depending upon the nature of the illness being treated.The therapeutic activity of a pharmaceutical agent administered in one of these manners is often influenced both by passive availability, namely the ability of the pharmaceutically active agent to be released from the carrier composition used to administer the agent, and by biological availability, namely the agent's ability to pass through a membrane. The lesser of these typically determines the speed of absorption of a pharmaceutically active agent by an organism. 

 In the case of topical applications, for example, the pharmaceutically active agent must be released from the carrier composition and partition into and penetrate the epidermis of the skin before it can be absorbed and transferred to elicit its pharmacological effects. Generally, passage through the epidermis is the slowest and consequently the rate-determining step. Enhanced passage through the epidermis is often attempted by selecting carrier compositions tailored to the particular pharmaceutically active agent being administered.Various methods are known for improving the absorbability of poorly absorbable pharmaceutically active agents. For example, absorbability in some cases is improved through a technological treatment of the pharmaceutically active agent, e.g. by means of micronization or complex- formation, or through the addition of solubility improving additives.These techniques, however, exhibit many disadvantages.
