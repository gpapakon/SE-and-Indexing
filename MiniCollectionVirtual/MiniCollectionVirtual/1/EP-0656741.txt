<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor package comprises a package body (101), 
a semiconductor chip disposed on the surface of the package 

body, a plurality of external lead terminals (5) disposed on 
opposite two side surfaces of the package body, a lid (4) 

hermetically sealing and shielding the semiconductor chip in 
the package body, a package substrate (1) having a 

metallized region (2) on which the package body is mounted, 
and a metal layer (110) disposed on the rear surface of the 

package body and connected to the metallized region of the 
package substrate (1) with solder (6). The metal layer 

(110) comprises a material having a good adhesion with the 
solder and has a pattern in which stripe-shaped metal 

portions (110a) abut on opposite two side surfaces of the 
package body where the external lead terminals are absent, 

and stripe-shaped openings (110b) of the metal layer abut on 
the respective metal portions (110a). Therefore, when the 

package body (101) is soldered to the package substrate (1), 
unwanted flow of the melted solder toward the center of the 

package body is stopped at the openings (110b) of the metal 
layer (110). Therefore, solder fillets (9) are produced on 

the side surfaces of the package body with high reliability, 
whereby the connecting condition can be inspected with eyes 

using the solder fillets (9).
