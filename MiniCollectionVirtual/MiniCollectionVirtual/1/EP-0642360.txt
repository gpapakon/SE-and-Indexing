<DESCRIPTION>
 Catalytic Reduction of Volatile Organic Contaminants in Indoor Air Technical Field This invention relates to the field of air purification, and particularly to a simplified device for catalytically removing volatile organic compounds from an ambient air space.Background Art Air pollution is an issue that has been discussed for many years. Pollutants in the air have been proved to affect human comfort and health. Originally, most air pollution concern was focussed on such factors as automobile and factory stack emissions. Relatively recently, it has been found that the quality of the air inside a home or business is frequently worse than the quality of the air outside that very same home or business. The problem has been termed the Sick Building syndrome, and it has been proved that many of the symptoms of this syndrome are caused by volatile organic compounds (hereafter VOC) in the ambient air within the building.This concern with indoor air pollution has passed from the realm of scholarly study into the area of publications intended for the general public. The Environmental Protection Agency published "The Inside Story: A Guide to Indoor Air Quality*'*' in 1988. This booklet discusses, among other things, the health effects caused by indoor air pollutants. The pollutants discussed include various VOCs, especially formaldehyde, as well as particulates. Any recognized problem breeds potential solutions, and many devices for reduction of air pollution have been developed. The simplest such devices draw the air through some sort of filtration device. Air purification devices to remove particulate materials such as dust and smoke particles from the ambient air particles are well known. Examples are the various versions of small units intended to remove cigarette smoke from the air. Electrostatic precipitation devices produce basically the same results without the need 

 for filter replacement. However, such devices can do little to remove VOCs from the air.The next step in sophistication are devices that, often in conjunction with a filtration or electrostatic precipitation system, incorporate an adsorptive material such as activated charcoal. The adsorptive material aids in the removal of volatile organic compounds from the air.One rather multifunctional and complex device includes many air purification approaches: filtering systems including an electrostatic one, adsorbent materials, washing systems, germicidal and heating elements, as well as fans to move air through the device.
