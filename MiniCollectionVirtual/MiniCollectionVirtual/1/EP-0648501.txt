<ABSTRACT>
Compositions and methods for treating or 
preventing infections in canin
e or feline animals 
which comprises administering an effective amount of 

granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), are 
disclosed. The G-CSF may be naturally derived, or 

alternatively, the G-CSF and genetically engineered 
variants of G-CSF may be the expression products of 

genetically engineered prokaryotic or eukaryotic 
host cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the use 
of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to 
treat or prevent infections in canine and feline 
animals. More specifically, the invention is directed 
to the use of G-CSF having the amino acid sequence of 
human G-CSF or having the amino acid sequence of canine 
G-CSF, in treating or preventing infections in canine or 
feline animals. The source of the G-CSF may be 
naturally derived or may be derived from genetically 
engineered prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells 
containing recombinant plasmid or viral DNA vectors 
carrying the human or canine G-CSF gene, or genetically 
engineered variants of canine G-CSF genes, or synthetic 
human or canine G-CSF genes. The present invention is 
also directed to DNA gene segments, biologically 
functional recombinant plasmids and viral DNA vectors, 
and prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells containing 
such recombinant plasmids and vectors, all of which 
contain a canine G-CSF gene or a genetically engineered 
variant of a canine G-CSF gene. Although antibiotic therapy is now used for 
animal infections with some success, huge losses 
persist. The early hopes that antibiotics would allow 
complete control of the disease have not been 
realized. None of the antibiotics utilized thus far has 
been entirely satisfactory. Additionally, it has been 
found to be very desirable to replace antibiotic 
treatment with treatment by non-antibiotic chemo-therapeutic 
drug compounds, for the following reasons:  (1) Antibiotics effective in human medicine 
should not be utilized in veterinary medicine, in order 
not to build up strain resistance of bacteria appearing 
in human diseases; and (2) Antibiotics should be reserved for such 
diseases for which no chemo-therapeutic drug compound 
would be available, as it has been proved that bacterial 
strains build up resistance to an antibiotic after 
extended use of such antibiotic. Despite these several published methods, it 
remains very important to find cost-effective methods 
utilizing non-antibiotic compounds which would 
substantially overcome the drawbacks of antibiotics used 
thus far and yet would be effective in treating and 
preventing infections in canine and feline animals. Canine parvo virus still infects over one-half 
million young dogs. Hospitalization and intensive care 
are required. Mortality occurs in 15-20% of the 
cases. Severe neutropenia occurs and death is thought 
to frequently result from secondary infections and 
sepsis. Feline Immunedeficiency Virus
