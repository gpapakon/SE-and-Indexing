<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for forming an image in a recording 
material and transferring said image from said recording 

material to an image receiving material in order to produce a 
transferred image in said image receiving material, comprising 

the steps of:
 

   exposing said recording material,
 

wherein said recording material comprises a support, a 
colorant layer containing a colorant, and a colorant barrier 

layer containing a light-absorbable substance in this order, 
said exposing causes to produce an ablated hole in said 

colorant barrier layer to form said image and said exposing is 
held with controlling means for exposing said recording 

material based on an image signal so that a size of said 
ablated hole in said colorant barrier layer is subject to 

change based on said image signal, said exposing means 
producing a light which is absorbed by said light-absorbable 

substance; and
 

   transferring said colorant from said colorant layer to 
said image receiving material through said ablated hole to 

produce said transferred image in said image receiving 
material in accordance with said image in said recording 

material by contacting said colorant barrier layer with an 
image receiving layer of said image receiving material in the 

presence of heat or pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a method for forming an image using
an image-transfer type image-recording
material capable of providing an image having a high
density and a high-gradation.Conventional transfer-image recording processes
include a process in which a thermal-transfer image-recording
material comprising a base member having provided thereon
a thermally fusible colorant layer or a colorant layer
containing a thermally sublimable dye and an image-receiving
material
is brought into
pressure contact from the ink-sheet side (that is the side of the
image-recording material) with 
a heat source,
that is controlled by an electric signal such as that sent
from a thermal head or an electrified head, 
and an image can be
transferred and then recorded.Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection
(hereinafter referred to JP OPI Publication) Nos. 63-35383/1988
and 63-35387/1988 each describe a technique,
wherein a support is provided with a sublimable ink
layer and a protective layer containing a thermoplastic resin
as the principal component; the protective layer is ablated by
irradiating with a laser beam so that the
ablated protective layer is fused; the protective
layer and an image-receiving paper sheet are brought into
close contact with each other and heat is applied thereto by a
laser or thermal head from the side of the support having the
sublimable ink layer; and image information
is thereby thermally transferred to the image-receiving layer.
JP OPI Publication
No. 4-201486/1990 discloses a technique in which a vacuum
evaporated metal layer is applied to a dye-barrier layer (that
is equivalent to the aforementioned protective layer).U.S. Patent
Nos. 5,156,938 and 5,171,650 describe a technique in which an
extremely high power-density laser beam is used to irradiate an
ink layer or a layer interposed between a support and an
ink layer so that the ink layer explodes; and by the
explosive power, the ink layer together with a binder are 
blown on to an image-receiving member so that an image on
the ink layer is transferred to the image-receiving member.EP-A-0618081, which falls within the terms of Article
54(3) EPC, relates to a thermal transfer image recording
method, wherein the size of an ablated hole corresponding
to the image is controlled by varying the incident light
energy.EP-A-0489972 refers to a heat-sensitive recording
material including a metal layer ablatable by high
intensity laser beam light. No means for controlling the
size of the ablated hole is provided. In the medical and

A method for recording an image which method
comprises:


(a) providing a recording material comprising a
support having thereon a colourant layer comprising a

colourant and a colourant barrier layer comprising a light-absorbing
substance in this order,
(b) exposing the recording material to a beam of
light so as to produce an ablated hole in the colourant

barrier layer, wherein the exposing includes controlling a
size of the ablated hole corresponding to the image by

changing a pulse duration or pulse number of the light, and
(c) transferring an amount of the colourant from
the colourant layer to an image receiving material through

the ablated hole by contacting the colourant barrier layer
with the image receiving material by applying heat or

pressure.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the
exposing means is a laser.
A method according to any preceding claim,
wherein the exposing is controlled so that a pixel of the

transferred image comprises a plurality of dots.
A method according to any preceding claim,
wherein the recording material further comprises a layer

for controlling an amount of the colourant to be
transferred between the colourant layer and the colourant

barrier layer. 
A method according to claim 4, wherein the
layer for controlling an amount of the colourant to be

transferred comprises a porous substance.
