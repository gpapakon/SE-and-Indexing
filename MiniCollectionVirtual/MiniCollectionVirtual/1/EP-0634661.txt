<ABSTRACT>
A method for calibrating an impact sensor enables 
calibration to take place after sensor manufacture is 

completed. During calibration, the sensor undergoes an 
acceleration while vehicle specific calibration values are 

programmed into sensor memory for different incremental 
rates of acceleration. Calibration verification checks to 

verify that the relationship between acceleration and sensor 
output is linear. The calibration also includes a 

hysteresis test by comparing output values when 
incrementally increasing the acceleration to corresponding 

acceleration values while incrementally decreasing 
acceleration. The calibration method may also include 

calculating a response time for a self-test circuit that can 
be stored in memory and later used during self-tests of the 

sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method for
calibrating impact sensors in a vehicle passenger restraint
mechanism and, more particularly, to a method for
calibrating impact sensors having accelerometers which
detect the occurrence of a high vehicle impact condition.Passive restraint systems such as air bags or
automatic seat belt tensioners have experienced increased
usage in vehicles to protect passengers during frontal
collisions. These types of occupant protection and safety
devices require no extra action by the passenger to achieve
protection. Rather, the passive restraint automatically
activates in the event of an activation worthy impact event.
To determine if a given event is activation worthy, an
impact sensing system in the vehicle detects impacts and
discriminates between activation worthy and non-activation
worthy impacts.One type of impact sensing system uses a plurality
of threshold switches in the front region of the vehicle.
These switches send a signal for inflating an air bag if a
high impact event is severe enough to close the switches.
Mechanical sensor-based systems of this type usually rely on
sensor redundancy to minimise the negative effects of any
sensor malfunction which may occur. This requires a large
number of switches within the vehicle, each of which must be
calibrated separately, increasing the overall complexity of
the impact sensing system and its calibration process. To
ensure proper functioning, the threshold switches must be
located in strategic places in the vehicle where they have
the best opportunity to detect and discriminate between
various types of impacts. Determining these locations
during calibration of the impact sensing system requires
extensive impact testing and studying of impact effects on 
the vehicle to determine the best placement for the
threshold switches.Another type of impact sensing system uses a single
point impact sensor instead of multiple switches. This type
of sensing system has an accelerometer located in the
passenger compartment of the vehicle that constantly
monitors the vehicle's acceleration and senses any sudden
deceleration. The output of the accelerometer is
continuously analysed to determine if and when deceleration
occurs and if the deceleration is caused by an impact that
is severe enough to require activation of the air bag or
other passenger restraint. This type of impact sensing
system is easier to calibrate because the sensor does not
involve a large number of parts that need to be calibrated
individually. Only the

A method for calibrating an impact sensor that
controls the activation of a passenger restraint mechanism

in a vehicle, the method comprising the steps of:

providing, within the sensor, a sense element that is
responsive to acceleration, means adapted to output

countable pulses for generating an electrical signal having
a value that is a function of the sense element response,

and an activation decision circuit having a counter means
for determining if the electrical signal is indicative of a

passenger restraint activation worthy event;
applying an acceleration to the sense element between a
rate of zero acceleration and a full scale acceleration;
incrementally adjusting the acceleration applied to the
sense element;
programming the generating means to adjust the value of
the electrical signal within a predetermined range for each

incremental acceleration value;
verifying the calibration of the impact sensor; and

   further comprising the steps of:

providing a self-test circuit;
simulating acceleration of the sense element at a first
time;
determining a second time at which the electrical
signal is indicative of a passenger restraint activation

worthy event;
calculating the difference between the first time and
second time; and
programming the self-test circuit with the difference.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
verifying step comprises the steps of:


measuring the electrical signal value at zero
acceleration; 
measuring the electrical signal value at full scale
acceleration;
measuring the electrical signal value for at least one
acceleration that is between zero acceleration and full

scale acceleration; and
verifying that the relationship between the electrical
signal value and acceleration is substantially linear.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
verifying step comprises the steps of:


measuring the electrical signal value at zero

incrementally increasing the acceleration;
measuring the value of the electrical signal at each
increment;
establishing a bias point based upon the electrical
signal value at zero acceleration;
computing a least squares line based upon the measured
values and having its intercept through the bias point; and
computing a difference between each measured value and
the least squares line wherein the impact sensor is out of

tolerance if the difference exceeds a predetermined value,
thereby indicating a non-linear relationship between the

electrical signal value and the acceleration sensed by the
sense element.

the step of programming the activation decision circuit to

indicate a passenger restraint activation worthy event when
the value of the electrical signal reaches a predetermined

A method as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
programming step comprises loading a second value into the

activation decision circuit that is equal to the total size
of the counter means minus the desired value of the 

electrical signal, to thereby indicate a passenger restraint

tampering.

A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims further comprising the steps of:


incrementally increasing the acceleration applied to
the sense element up to a predetermined maximum value;
noting the pulse density of said electrical signal at
each increment;
incrementally decreasing the acceleration applied to
the sense element;
comparing the pulse density at each increment while
decreasing acceleration to the pulse density at

corresponding increments noted during increasing
acceleration and noting a difference in pulse density

wherein the impact sensor is out of tolerance if the
difference in pulse densities exceeds a predetermined value.
