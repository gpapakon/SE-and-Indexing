A water-dilutable (water-thinnable), glazing or covering coating composition is proposed which comprises 0.05 - 2 % by weight of alkalis, 1.2 to 20 % by weight of natural hard and/or natural hardened resins, 1.56 - 50 % by weight of natural oils, their hydrolysis products and/or concentration (boil-down) products, 0.05 - 10 % by weight of auxiliaries, up to 10 % by weight of natural waxes, up to 30 % by weight of pigments and/or dyes, and up to 30 % by weight of fillers, with water as the remainder. The weight ratio of oils, their hydrolysis products and/or concentration products to the resins is in the range from 1.3:1 to 2.5:1.
