<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a building of the kind comprising a primary chassis incorporating main roof beams (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31) supported on columns (12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22) and a main horizontal roof structure comprising said main roof beams and secondary roof elements (32), the method comprising the steps of: preselecting a standard design of secondary roof element having pre-selected standard horizontal dimensions such that a main roof structure of main beams and standard elements can be built with horizontal dimensions representing integral multiples of the standard horizontal dimensions; selecting main roof structure dimensions as a multiple of the standard element dimensions to fit within the required building periphery with a gap between at least part of the main roof structure and said periphery; erecting columns of a primary chassis to support a main roof structure at positions around the periphery of the required building; constructing the main roof structure from main beams and standard elements with main beams around the periphery of the main roof structure and with outward extensions from the main beams across the gap to the columns whereby the main roof structure is supported on the columns. The invention also extends to a building suitable for production by this method.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A BUILDING AND METHOD OF PRODUCING A BUILDINGThe invention relates to buildings and methods of producing buildings.In the establishment of commercial and industrial buildings, speed of construction has significant economic advantages. A building project has to take place in several stages, starting with planning and site preparation and ending with fitting out. Many of these stages have to be carried out consecutively rather than concurrently. Any changes in procedure enabling normally consecutive operations to be carried out concurrently can lead to substantial savings of time.Time savings of this kind are particularly beneficial with large retail stores because opening a store early reduces the period of investment without return in the site and building works.One way of saving time in the design of a building is to standardise a particular form of structure which can be designed in advance of requirements for a particular building and which can be adapted simply to the requirements of a particular building when known. It is also advantageous to provide a basic building structure to a standardised design which can accommodate a wide 

range of variations in detail without requiring any variation in the basic structure. With such an arrangement, it is even possible to start building the main structure before all detailed requirements for the building have been specified or agreed, with confidence that the main structure can accommodate any reasonable design details established at a later date.The invention is concerned with a building and a method of producing a building which contribute towards achieving the above mentioned objectives.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a building having a roof and exterior walls, a primary chassis of the building incorporating main roof beams supported on columns, a main roof structure extending over most but not all of the building as defined by its exterior walls and comprising main beams extending along the outer periphery of the main roof structure and secondary roof elements supported by the main beams, the columns being positioned at the exterior walls of the building, extensions of main beams beyond the periphery of the main roof structure connecting the main beams to the columns whereby the columns support the main roof structure, outer parts of the roof beyond the main roof structure being supported on main beams and on upright supports located along the line of the exterior 

walls of the building.By employing a primary chassis of

CLAIMS
1. A building having a roof and exterior walls, a primary chassis of the building incorporating main roof beams supported on columns, a main roof structure extending over most but not all of the building as defined by its exterior walls and comprising main beams extending along the outer periphery of the main roof structure and secondary roof elements supported by the main beams, the columns being positioned at the exterior walls of the building, extensions of main beams beyond the periphery of the main roof structure connecting the main beams to the columns whereby the columns support the main roof structure, outer parts of the roof beyond the main roof structure being supported on main beams and on upright supports located along the line of the exterior walls of the building.
2. A building as claimed in Claim 1 also incorporating at least one internal main beam extending across the building within the main roof structure and at least one internal column supporting an internal main beam within the main roof structure.
3. A building as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein at least one column is constructed to resist lateral loads in one direction and at least one other column is 


constructed to resist lateral loads in another direction.
4. A building as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein each main roof beam comprises upper and lower members and braces between them.
5. A building as claimed in any one of the preceding claims incorporating triangulated members forming an outer part of the roof beyond the main roof structure.
6. A method of producing a building of the kind comprising a primary chassis incorporating main roof beams supported on columns and a main horizontal roof structure comprising said main roof beams and secondary roof elements, the method comprising the steps of:
a pre-selecting a standard design of secondary roof element having pre-selected standard horizontal dimensions such that a main roof structure of main beams and standard elements can be built with horizontal dimensions representing integral multiples of the standard horizontal dimensions, b selecting main roof structure dimensions as a multiple of the standard element dimensions to fit within the required building periphery with a gap between at least part of the main roof 


 structure and said periphery, c erecting columns of a primary chassis to support a main roof structure at positions around the periphery of the required building, and d constructing the main roof structure from main beams and standard elements with main beams around the periphery of the main roof structure and with outward extensions from the main beams across the gap to the columns whereby the main roof structure is supported on the columns.
