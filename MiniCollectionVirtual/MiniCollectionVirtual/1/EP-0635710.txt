<ABSTRACT>
It is known in clinical analyzers to 
dispense patient sample on to a test element using 

metering pipettes. Dispensing using such pipettes may 
introduce problems, such as, flow irregularities in 

the test element, which influence the reliability of 
the test results obtained. Described herein is 

apparatus and method for uniformly transferring a 
liquid material to a test element in which a transfer 

element (10) having a body portion (2) and a liquid-impermeable 
supporting surface (6, 7, 8) which has an 

area approximately equal to the surface area subtended 
by the test volume of the test element, is brought 

into direct contact with the test surface of the test 
element so that the liquid is transferred 

instantaneously over the entirety of the surface area 
of the test element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method 
and apparatus for surface area liquid transfer, for 
use in clinical analyzers for testing of liquid 
analytes, and is particularly concerned with a method 
and apparatus for transferring patient sample to a 
test element in such analyzers. In the field of clinical analyzers for the 
testing of liquid analytes, a patient sample is 
introduced and caused to interact with a reaction 
chemistry to produce a signal involving the analyte of 
choice, for detection by a sensing apparatus. A 
preferred technique used by analyzers involves the so-called 
dried assay technology so that patient sample 
is applied to dried test slide elements, each having a 
dried reactant layer. Analyzers and test elements 
using this technology include those manufactured by 
Eastman Kodak Company, both under the trademark 
"EKTACHEM™". In a conventional operation, a patient 
sample is conveyed to a processing station within an 
analyzer where it is dispensed on to a test element. 
The sample is dispensed by means of a point source, 
usually a disposable pipette tip, which is positioned 
a short distance above the test element surface and 
has a tip orifice from where the sample is expelled 
(or metered) on to the test element. A metering tip 
method of dispensing patient liquid is described in 
US-A-5 143 849. However, there are a number of problems 
relating to a metering technique such as those 
typically described. First, it is important to understand that 
sample delivered from a point source has to spread 
horizontally, as well as vertically, through the  
 
predetermined test volume of the test element. The 
need for both directions of spreading introduces the 
possibility of flow irregularities. Second, the reliability of test results is 
impacted by the sensitivity occurring due to 
differences in the makeup of samples between patients. 
For example, a patient may have a serum, plasma or 
whole blood sample which may contain a high fat 
content, (that is, containing a higher percentage of 
lipids and lipo-proteins than a "normal" patient). 
These sorts of differences are not, however, limited 
to non-average patients; differences in samples 
between patients in the so-called "normal" range may 
also impact the accuracy of test results. In some cases, the presence of varying 
amounts of biological components and salts in the 
patient sample can produce a variation in the sample's 
viscosity, surface tension and contact angle, 
impacting its ability to outwardly spread in a uniform

A method of dispensing a liquid sample 
on to a test element (50, 52, 54, 60, 61) having a 

test volume (V) subtending a surface area (S) for that 
volume for receiving the liquid sample, the method 

comprising the steps of:- 

a) applying on to a transfer element (10) 
having a liquid-supporting surface (7) for supporting 

a liquid, a quantity of liquid sample over 
substantially all of the liquid-supporting surface 

(7); and 
b) placing the liquid-supporting surface 
(7) of the transfer element (10) in contact with all 

of the surface area (S) of a test element (50, 52, 54, 
60, 61) at once, thereby transferring the liquid 

sample as a surface-dispersed quantity to the test 
element (50, 52, 54, 60, 61) without the need for 

extensive horizontal flow over the surface area (S) of 
the test element (50, 52, 54, 60, 61). 
A method according to claim 1, further 
comprising the step of removing excess liquid material 

from the liquid-supporting surface (7) of the transfer 
element (10) prior to step b). 
A liquid dispensing device for 
dispensing a liquid sample on to a test element (50, 

52, 54, 60, 61) having a test surface (S), the device 
comprising:- 

   a main body portion (2); 
   a transfer portion (6, 7, 8) supported by 

the main body portion (2) for engagement with a test 
element (50, 52, 54
, 60, 61), the transfer portion (6,
