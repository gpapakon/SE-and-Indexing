 TITLEVitronectin Receptor AntagonistsFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to pharmaceutically active compounds which inhibit the vitronectin receptor and are useful for the treatment of inflammation, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, and diseases wherein bone resorption is a factor, such as osteoporosis.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIntegrins are a superfamily of cell adhesion receptors, which are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed on a variety of cells. These cell surface adhesion receptors include gpllb /Ilia, the fibrinogen receptor, and y^ the vitronectin receptor. The fibrinogen receptor gpllb /Ilia is expressed on the platelet surface and it mediates platelet aggregation and the formation of a hemostatic clot at the site of a bleeding wound. Philips, et al, Blood., 1988, 77, 831. The vitronectin receptor αvβ3 is expressed on a number of cells, including endothelial, smooth muscle, osteoclast, and tumor cells, and, thus, it has a variety of functions. The αv63 receptor expressed on the membrane of osteoclast cells mediates the bone resportion process and contributes to the development of osteoporosis. Ross, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1987, 262, 7703. The αvβ3 receptor expressed on human aortic smooth muscle cells stimulates their migration into neointima, which leads to the formation of atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. Brown, et al., Cardiovascular Res., 1994, 28, 1815. Additionally, a recent study has shown that a αvβ3 antagonist is able to promote tumor regression by inducing apoptosis of angiogenic blood vessels. Brooks, et al., Cell, 1994, 79, 1157. Thus, agents that would block the vitronectin receptor would be useful in treating diseases mediated by this receptor, such as osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, restenosis and cancer.The vitronectin receptor is known to bind to bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin, bone sialoprotein and thrombospondin, which contain the tri-peptide Arg-Gly-Asp (or RGD) motif. Thus, Horton, et al., Exp. Cell Res. 1991, 195, 368, disclose that RGD-containing peptides and an anti-vitronectin receptor antibody (23C6) inhibit dentine resorption and cell spreading by osteoclasts. In addition, Sato, et al, J. Cell Biol. 1990, 111, 1713 disclose that echistatin, a snake venom peptide which contains the RGD sequence, is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption in tissue culture, and inhibits attachment of osteoclasts to bone. Fisher, et al, Endocrinology 1993, 132, 1411, has further shown that echistatin
