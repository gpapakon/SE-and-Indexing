<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of an azomethine
compound as a UV light absorber.
More particularly, as a UV light absorber which
absorbs long-wavelength UV light (UV-A) having a wavelength
of 320 to 400 nm.UV light from the sun has a wavelength within a range
of 240 to 400 nm. UV light is classified into three zones
by the wavelength range. That is, they are UV light (UV-A)
having a long wavelength of 320 to 400 nm which is referred
to as a suntan wavelength, UV light (UV-B) having a
wavelength of 280 to 320 nm which is referred to as a
sunburn wavelength and UV light (UV-C) having a low
wavelength of 240 to 280 nm which is absorbed in the ozone
layer over the earth and scarcely reach the surface of the
earth. Since a lot of organic compounds exposed to these
radiations are decomposed or rendered unstable, UV light has
hitherto been the factor which deteriorates the value of
various commercial products.UV light absorbers have been added to polymeric
materials (e.g. plastic, rubber), heat-sensitive
recording sheets and inks for heat transfer or liquid
crystal display materials in order to provide light-resistant
(weather-resistant) materials which have 
resistance to fading due to sunlight. Further, they have
been used for cosmetics, paints, lens, filters, films,
in order to prevent inflammation of the human body as well
as deterioration of products due to UV light.As the UV light absorbers, for example, there have
hitherto been known compounds such as salicylate,
benzophenone, benzotriazole, cyanoacrylate, hydantoin
derivative and hindered amine (photostabilizer).Since most of them absorb UV light having a wavelength
of 290 to 380 nm, they are transparent and have no
substantial influence on transparency of plastics or colored
products. However, they have an insufficient absorptivity
to UV light having a wavelength within a range of 360 to 400
nm.Thus, the main object of the present invention is to provide
a UV light absorber which exhibits absorption with a large
molecular absorption coefficient ε to UV-A, particularly UV
light having a wavelength within a range of 360 to 400 nm,
and a process for producing a UV filter comprising the same. This object has been achieved by a UV light absorber
comprising an azomethine compound represented by the
formula:

[wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom, or a straight- or branched-chain
alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms (e.g. a methyl,
ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl and sec-butyl group); and
R2 and R3 independently represent a hydrogen atom, a
carboxyl
