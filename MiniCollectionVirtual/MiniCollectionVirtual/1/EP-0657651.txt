<ABSTRACT>
A pump is provided which comprises a first centrifugal pump (4) 
arranged to act as an inlet stage, a second centrifugal pump (14) and a 

hybrid pump (28). A flow controller is arranged to select between the 
second centrifugal pump (14) and the hybrid pump (28) as an output 

stage. The second centrifugal pump (14) is used as an output stage 
during normal operation, whereas the hybrid pump is used as an output 

stage during start-up, priming and low speed running.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump. Such a pump is suitable for 
supplying fuel to a gas turbine engine. According to the present invention, there is provided a pump comprising 
a first centrifugal pump arranged to act as an inlet stage, a second 
centrifugal pump, a hybrid pump, and flow control means for selecting 
between the second centrifugal pump and the hybrid pump as an output 
stage. It is thus possible to provide the total engine fuel pumping function in a 
centrifugal pump-based system while maintaining good start, dry lift, and 
reprime performance and minimising heat rejection. The second 
centrifugal pump functions as the main output stage, i.e. it is used as the 
output stage during normal operating conditions, but the hybrid pump is 
used as the output stage during a starting and/or priming phase. The 
hybrid pump may also provide servo actuation pressure for engine 
actuators at sub-idle engine speeds. Preferably the first centrifugal pump has an axial impeller. Preferably the second centrifugal pump has a radial impeller. Preferably 
the impeller is dished to reduce the overhang moment. Preferably the hybrid pump is a side channel pump. The side channel pump may be in series or in parallel with the second 
certrifugal pump.  Preferably a first valve is provided for controlling liquid flow from an 
outlet of the inlet stage to an inlet of the side channel pump. Preferably a second valve is provided for controlling liquid flow from an 
outlet of the side channel pump. Advantageously the second valve, 
when at a closed position such that the second centrifugal pump is 
selected as the output stage, connects the side channel pump to a drain. Preferably a pressure relief valve is provided to relieve excess pressure at 
the outlet of the side channel pump. Thus the pressure rise provided by 
the side channel pump is limited. This minimises waste input power 
when the side channel pump capability is excessive. Preferably a non-return valve is provided at the outlet of the second 
centrifugal pump. Advantageously the non-return valve opens when the 
pressure at the output of the second centrifugal pump exceeds the 
pressure at the output of the side channel pump. Advantageously 
opening of the non-return valve supplies servo pressure to the first and 
second valves so as to close the first and second valves. Preferably a reservoir is provided downstream of a side channel pump 
outlet valve. The first centrifugal pump and the second centrifugal pump may be 
cantilever mounted at opposing
