<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic electrolytic
solution cell which has good shelf stability.Organic electrolytic solution cells, a typical example of
which is a manganese dioxide-lithium cell, are increasingly used,
since they generate a high voltage and have a high energy density.A perchlorate base electrolyte such as LiClO4 is generally
used as an electrolyte to be contained in an electrolytic solution
used in such organic electrolytic solution cell. Recently, in view of
safety of the cells, it is undesirable to use dangerous materials such
LiClO4 in the cells.Apart from LiClO4, boron lithium salts such as LiBF4 or
LiB(C6H5)4 are used as the lithium salt electrolytes.However, when such boron lithium salt is used as the
electrolyte, the electrolytic solution tends to be discolored or polymerizes
some kinds of media of the electrolytic solution during
storage. When such electrolytic solution is used in the cell, a shelf
stability of the cell is shortened. EP 0 122 381 relates to a secondary battery containing organoborate electrolyte,
in particular with conjugated polymer anodes, such as polyacetylene, contain an
electrolyte including a salt of the formula MBR4-w-y-zR'wR"yX2 wherein M is an alkali
metal, B is boron, R is alkyl, R' is aryl or alkyl-substituted aryl, R" is heterocycle,
X is F, Cl, Br, I, CN, OCN, SCN, fluoroaryl or perfluoroalky-substituted aryl, w and
y is integers of 0 to 4, and z is an integer of 0 to 4, provided that when X is
solely F, Cl, I, Br, CN, OCN, SCN or perfluoroalkyl, Z is not 4; with the sum x+y-z
being equal to or less than 4. Exemplary salts are LiBMe4, LibMe2Ph2, LiBMe2PhPy,
LibMe2Py2 and KBPh3SCN (where M = methyl, Ph = phenyl and Py = pyrrolyl).
Cathodes such as conjugated backbone polymers (e.g. polyacetylene) and transition-metal
chalcogenides (e.g. polyacetylene) and transition-metal chalcogenides
(e.g. TiS2) are disclosed. The battery can be charged to a state wherein
the anode is in a reduced state of 0.1 V - 0.5 V (relative to M/M+) where a voltage
plateau exists in some instances.US 3,403,305 A relates to an electrolytic capacitor having an electrolyte containing
borate coordination compound.GB 2 143 228 A relates to a non-aqueous electrolyte for use in electrolytic devices
comprises an organo-boron complex, consisting of a condensation product
of boric acid and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, particularly oxalic acid, or an Î³-hydroxy
carboxylic acid, in a non-aqueous solvent.One object of the present invention is to provide an
organic electrolytic
