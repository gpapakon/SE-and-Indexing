<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sample dispenser device for applying liquid samples on a sample receiving area, comprising a body having a sample receiving surface (5) on the front face thereof, said surface being defined by a peripheral edge (6). The sample receiving surface (5) is provided with a recess (7) in such a way that a droplet of a liquid sample having a predetermined size adheres to the sample receiving surface (5) when said sample receiving surface (5) is dipped in a sample reservoir and is fully transferred when the sample receiving surface (5) is placed on the sample receiving area. The recess (7) is embodied in the form of a flat recess (7), that is, the depth thereof is smaller that its width. The inventive sample dispenser has a simple embodiment and the flat recess thereof makes it possible to determine the desired amount of sample to be transferred, which can be very precisely reproduced.
