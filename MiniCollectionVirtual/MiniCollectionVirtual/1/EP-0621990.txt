Method for charging an accumulator (3), a logic 
circuit (19) detecting the temperature of the accumulator 

(3) as an input quantity (T) for controlling the charging 
current, and turning off the charging process when a 

predetermined accumulator voltage is reached, characterized 
in that 


the logic circuit (19) first detects the type of 
accumulator (3) connected, 
the voltage (U) and the time variations of temperature 
and voltage (dT/dt, dU/dt) are determined as 

further input quantities, 
a plurality of classes (small, normal, large, neg., 
pos., large pos.) that overlap in the boundary 

region are formed for each of the determined input 
quantities (T, U, dT/dt, dU/dt), 
all classes (small, normal, large, neg., pos., large 
pos.) into which the measured values of the input 

quantities fall, are linked in fuzzy-logic fashion 
to form membership functions, 
a predetermined current value, corresponding to the 
membership function, is formed in order to set the 

charging current (I). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 

that the classes "high voltage", "low voltage", "increasing 
voltage" or "decreasing voltage" are discriminated 

and the charging process is controlled accordingly. 
Method according to either of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the classes "high accumulator 

temperature", "low accumulator temperature", "increasing 
accumulator temperature" and "decreasing accumulator  

 
temperature" are discriminated. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the instantaneous voltage or the temperature 

of the accumulator are detected over a plurality of 
measurements and preferably averaged. 
Charger for accumulators (3), for carrying out 
the method according to one of the preceding claims, 

having means for determining the instantaneous voltage 
(U), the temperature (T) of the accumulators and the time 

variations of the temperature and of the voltage (dT/dt, 
dU/dt), and having a control device (1) which influences 

the charging process, characterized in that 

the control device (1) contains means for detecting 
the type of accumulator (3) connected, 
the control device (1) has a fuzzy processor (19, 
21), and 
the fuzzy processor (19, 21) is designed in such a 
way as to form a control signal for the charging 

current (I) from the classes (small, normal, large, 
neg., pos., large pos.) into which the determined 

input quantities (T, dT, U, dU/dt) fall. 
Charger according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the signals assigned to the voltage (U) and to the 

temperature (T) as well as to the time derivatives 
thereof are linked to each other in the control device 

(I). 
Charger according to Claim 5 or 6, characterized 
in that voltage (U) and temperature (T) can be detected 

in a plurality of sequential measurements and can preferably 
be averaged. 
Use of a charger according to one of the preceding 
claims, for the charging of NiCad and/or NiH accumulators.
