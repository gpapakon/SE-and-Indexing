<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to anti-friction 
bearings, and more particularly to bearings for rotating or 
oscillating shafts. Self-aligning angular contact roller bearings are shown 
in U.S. Patent No. 2,387,962 issued October 30, 1945 and U.S. 
Patent No. 2,767,037 issued October 16, 1956. In each of those 
patents the illustrated roller bearing includes an inner race 
member that provides a substantially spherical inner race 
surface, a pair of outer race surfaces having convex curvatures, 
and a pair of oppositely inclined rows of hourglass-shaped 
rollers. Those bearings also include bearing cages or retainers 
to provide proper guidance and separation of the rollers in each 
row. An example of the above-described bearing unit is produced 
by Rexnord Bearing Division of Downers Grove, Illinois and has a 
Model No. DP138H. The load exerted on a bearing unit such as is described 
above is typically carried by the rollers in only one part of the 
unit at a time, that part being referred to as the "load zone". 
Especially where bearings are used in oscillatory applications, 
such as an aircraft structure support applications, it is desired 
that the rollers precess or index so that they are cycled through 
the load zone. Cycling the rollers redistributes lubrication,  
 
provides for uniform wear of the rollers, and decrease fretting 
in the rollers and the race surfaces resulting from metal to 
metal contact between the rollers and the race surfaces. To 
cause such processing or indexing of the rollers, it is known to 
use a retainer including a central ring having axially projecting 
fingers that separate adjacent rollers in each row. A known 
retainer has fingers inclined at about four degrees to provide a 
desired amount of skew to the rollers, the skew of the rollers 
providing processing or indexing of the rollers during 
oscillation of the bearing. A disadvantage associated with the foregoing roller 
bearing units is the inclusion of a retainer, guide ring or the 
like. Such components are costly to produce and assemble as part 
of the bearing unit, and a retainer occupies space within the 
bearing unit that could otherwise be used for additional rollers 
or additional lubricant. The invention provides an improved anti-friction roller 
bearing apparatus suitable for slow rotation or oscillatory 
service. The bearing apparatus does away with the roller 
retainer or guide ring present in prior art arrangements without 
significantly adversely affecting the indexing or processing 
characteristic
