<ABSTRACT>
Clamping collar consisting of a strip of metal wound on itself including, close to its ends, on the one hand a lug formed of two bends of the strip pushed together back to back and projecting radially relative to the outer periphery of the collar, and on the other hand a hook capable of being clipped behind the lug during the clamping of the collar. The strip includes two portions (1, 2) of which one, termed the inner one, extends at least over a complete circumference, with partial overlap of its inner strand 1a and of its outer strand (1b), whereas the other portion, termed the outer one, extends only over part of a circumference, the outer portion (2) being fixed, at one of its ends, by any appropriate means, onto the outer face of the inner portion (1) and being suitably formed at its other end to constitute the hook (2a), the lug (1c) itself being located at the end of the outer length (1b) of the inner portion (1).
