Control device for influencing speed for use in vehicles 
with a retarder and a driving engine with associated output 

regulating member 

1.1 a control device (1) is provided; 
1.2 a regulating device (4) is provided; 
1.3 a switching device (7) is provided with at least one first 
switching position (SI) and one second switching position 

(SII); 
1.4 in the first switching position (SI) the regulating device 
(4) is connected to the retarder (2); 
1.5 in the second switching position (SII) the regulating 
device (4) is connected to the output regulating member (5) 

of the driving engine (3); 
1.6 the control device (1) comprises at least one first input 
for a speed signal; 
1.7 the first input is connected to a measuring device, which 
measures the actual speed of the vehicle or the rotational 

speed of the wheels; 
1.8 the control device (1) gives rise to the current actual 
speed being compared with an admissible maximum speed which 

can be preset; 
1.9 the control device (1) comprises at least one first and one 
second output; 
 
characterised by the following features: 


1.10 the control device (1) comprises at least one further 
second input for a signal from a retarder switch (9); 
1.10 the first output is connected to the regulating device (4); 
1.11 the second output is connected to the switching device (7); 
1.12 the control device (1) gives rise to the fact that upon a 
comparison of the current actual speed with an admissible 

maximum speed which can be preset 

when the maximum speed is exceeded and the retarder switch 
is in the zero position, the regulating device (4) is 

connected to the driving engine (3); 
when the maximum speed is exceeded and there is a signal  
 

from the retarder switch (9), the regulating device (4) is 
connected to the retarder (2). 
Control device according to Claim 1, characterised by the 
following features: 


2.1 the regulating device (4) is constructed as a pneumatic 
proportional valve; 
2.2 a pneumatic regulating cylinder (6) is associated with the 
output regulating member (5) of the driving engine. 
Control device according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the switching device (7) is a multi-way 

valve. 
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that when the maximum speed is not reached and 

there is a signal from the retarder switch (9) and simultaneous 
activation of a second control device, which is active at the 

output regulating member (5), the switching device (7) adopts the 
first switching position (SI). 
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised by the following features: 


5.1 as a signal from the retarder switch (9), a desired 
adjustable speed value (constant speed function) is adhered 

to; 
5.2 the control device (1) brings about a continuous comparison 
between the current actual speed and the desired constant 

speed and in the case of a deviation, an adjustment of the 
desired speed value by controlling the retarder (2). 
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that the control device (1) comprises integrated 
switching logic. 
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the control device (1) is constructed as  

 
a microprocessor, in which preprogrammable routines are worked 

out. 
Control device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that upon the presence of the signal from the 

retarder switch "constant speed" (V
const
) the output regulating 
member of the driving engine is brought first of all into the 

idling position.
