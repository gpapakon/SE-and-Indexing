<ABSTRACT>
The tailboard (20) of a loading truck is to be capable of being opened and closed hydraulically at a low outlay in terms of construction and, moreover, is to be locked mechanically in the closed state by means of operationally reliable components. This is achieved in that the pocket (9) and tongue (22) forming a catch are formed by components which belong directly to the vehicle frame (2) and to the tailboard (20) respectively. Locking takes place in that the tailboard (20) is lifted off into the closing position by means of a control rod (13) and lifting cylinder (12).

A loading wagon with a rear wall (20) which is connected to 
the side walls (5) of the loading wagon by means of swing arms (18) 

and which can be opened and closed by hydraulic stroke cylinders (12) 
and which is additionally mechanically locked in the closed position, 

characterised in that the tongue (22) of the lock member (9, 22) is 
formed by a fixed part of the rear wall (20) and that the pocket (9) 

of the lock member (9, 22) is formed by a fixed part (8) of the 
vehicle frame (2) or vice-versa and that said tongue (22) is held in 

the locking position by the action of one or more stroke cylinders 

(12). 
A loading wagon with a rear wall (20) according to claim 1 
characterised in that the stroke cylinders (12) on the one hand are 

pivotably movably connected to a side wall (5) of the loading wagon 
while on the other hand they are pivotably movably connected to 

control bars (13) which in turn are mounted at the upper end by means 
of a slot guide (14) longitudinally movably and pivotably to the side 

wall (5) of the loading wagon and at their lower end (23) are 
rotatably connected to the rear wall (20). 
A loading wagon according to claim 2 characterised in that 
in the closed position (Figure 1) of the rear wall (20) the control 

bars (13) are held by the stroke cylinders (12) in the highest 
possible position governed by the slot guide (14) and that thereby 

the tongues (22) of the lock members (9, 22) are held fast in the 
pockets (9). 
A loading wagon according to claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that surfaces (21) in the lower region of the rear wall (20) co-operate 

with surfaces (10) on the vehicle frame (2) in such a way 
that they limit the closing movement of the rear wall (20).  

 
A loading wagon according to claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the pockets (9) are so wide that in the closed position (Figure 

1) they permit a limited transverse mobility of the tongues (22) of 
the lock members (9, 22). 
A loading wagon according to claims 1 to 5 characterised in 
that to open the rear wall (20) (Figure 3) the piston rods (16) of 

the stroke cylinders (12) are extended so far that the control bars 
(13) move into the lowermost position which is defined by the slot 

guide (14) whereby the mechanical locking action is released and upon 
continued movement of the piston rod (16) the rear wall (20) together 

with its associated swing arms (18) is lifted out. 
A loading wagon according to claims 5 and 6 characterised in 
that in the closed position the rear wall (20) can move under the 

action of an increased pressure produced by the wagon load within the 
limited mobility in the mechanical locking means (9, 22) in 

opposition to the action of the stroke cylinders (12) so that the 
surfaces (21) on the rear wall (20) and the surfaces (10) on the 

machine frame (2) lift away from each other. 
A loading wagon according to claim 7 characterised in that 
the movement of the rear wall (20) which causes the surfaces (10, 21) 

to lift off each other triggers a control pulse which stops the 
advance movement of a roller floor (7) provided in the loading wagon. 
A loading wagon according to claims 4 to 8 characterised in 
that when the surfaces (10, 21) on the rear wall (20) and on the 

machine frame (2) meet or shortly previously a control pulse is 
triggered which either directly or by a signal to the driver causes 

retraction of the stroke cylinders (12) into their inner limit 
position.
