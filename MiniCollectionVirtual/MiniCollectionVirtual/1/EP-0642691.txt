<ABSTRACT>
An optical recording structure comprises a thermally stable substrate and a polymeric layer deposited on the substrate comprised of a poly(ester-amide). Laser beams are directed at the deposited polymeric layer to record or erase information. The recording structure has an excellent dimensional and mechanical stability on storage, readily and easily records information, and has an ability to be easily and completely erased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention generally relates to optical recording
mediums and techniques for recording of information
thereon. More particularly, the present invention relates
to an information recording medium, preferably in the form
of a disk, or in tape format, suitable for use with an
optical recording and playback apparatus.Optical recording methods have been proposed in which
light from a laser is focused upon the surface of a
recording medium with sufficient intensity to cause a
detectable change in the physical characteristics of the
surface material. Among these methods is the establishment
of an information pattern of pits in the surface an
optical medium. In such methods, the information
representative pattern of pits can be formed in the
surface of the recording medium by suitably controlling
the intensity of the focused light in accordance with the
information to be recorded while relative motion is
established between the recording medium and the focused
light spot.Recently, there have been efforts to develop an
information recording method in which information is
written in a thin film of metal or the like formed on a
substrate by using a laser ray or beam. According to such
a method, information recording has been accomplished by
forming holes or recesses in metallic thin films under the
action of a thermal energy beam such as a laser ray. This
method is suggested in, for instance, U.S. Patent No.
4,238,803.Dyes and pigments have also been employed in
information layers of recording media, often to enhance
the sensitivity of the recording layers at the particular
wavelength of the laser being used. Their use can provide 
a much sharper recording and playback of the information.For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,097,895 describes a
recording medium which includes a light reflecting
material, such as aluminum or gold, coated with a dye-containing
light absorbing layer, such as a fluorescein
layer which is operative with an argon laser light source.
The thickness of the light absorbing layer is chosen so
that the structure has a minimum reflectivity. An incident
light beam then ablates, vaporizes or melts the dye-containing
light absorbing layer, leaving a hole and
exposing the light reflecting layer. After recording at
the wavelength of the recording light, maximum contrast
between the minimum reflectance of the light absorbing
layer and the reflectance of the light reflecting layer
exists.Techniques for erasing the deformation pattern have
involved reheating the thermoplastic film above its
melting point
