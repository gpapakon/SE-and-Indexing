<ABSTRACT>
A golf shoe stud comprises a moulded plastics body (11) enabling the stud to be mounted in the underside of the shoe, a steel stem (22) which extends through the body and forms a frusto-conical stump (24) projecting below the body, a thin steel lamina (30) which overlies the underside and edges of the plastics body (11), and a nose (20) of tungsten carbide which is mounted on the stump (24). The nose is bonded to the stump by brazing, and an upper end portion (23) of the steel stem is out-turned for securement of the body (11) and the lamina (30) between the out-turned portion (23) and the nose (20). The stud may be of a replaceable kind in which the plastics body (11) forms a threaded spigot (16) and a sole-engaging flange (18), or it may be of a permanent kind in which the moulded body (11') is arranged to be incorporated in manufacture into a moulded shoe sole.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stud for an article of
footwear comprising stud-mounting means for enabling
the stud to be secured in the underside of the article
and from which a ground-engaging nose projects, the
stud-mounting means comprising a moulded plastics body.The provision of studs in the undersides of shoes,
boots and other articles of footwear for use in games,
sports and other athletic activities, to reduce or
eliminate slipping on the ground, is commonplace.One well known example of such a stud is described
in GB-A-2 028 102. The stud there described comprises
a hardened steel pin secured within a moulded plastics
body for securement in a shoe sole (or heel). The pin
comprises an enlarged head forming a ground-engaging
nose of the stud which projects from a broad
sole-engaging flange of the body. The head abuts the
flange and a stem of the pin extends from the head
upwardly through a bore in the body, the tail end of
the stem being upset to secure the assembly by clamping
the body against the head of the pin. The body is
formed externally with a screw thread which enables the
stud to be secured in a complementary threaded socket
provided in a shoe sole. By unscrewing the stud it can
be replaced should it become damaged or unduly worn.That stud construction has been very successful in
particular for golf shoes, but increasingly there is a
demand for such studs to be more resistant to wear.To militate against wear of the nose of a stud, it
is known to introduce a hard insert into the nose. For
example, as described in GB-A-1 277 694, US-A-3 766 670 
and WO 92/02156 a ball of a hard wear-resistant
material such as tungsten carbide may be secured at the
tip of the stud nose, it being the tip that in practice
usually suffers the greatest wear. An alternative
method of achieving a similar result is described in
US-A-3 600 831 and US-A-3 552 043, a cylindrical stump
of hard material there being housed within a tubular
end portion of a steel pin which otherwise forms the
stud nose.Both of these methods of increasing the
wear-resistance of the stud nose can be partially
satisfactory but undue wearing of the remainder of the
nose may still occur and ultimately the hard tip insert
can come loose and be lost.Addressing both of these problems, proposals have
been made for the entire nose (by which is meant at
least all of the visible part of the nose, presenting
the ground-engaging surfaces) to be of wear-resistant
material. As described in GB-A-2 248 762, a
non-replaceable stud (nose and body) may be
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A stud for an article of footwear comprising
stud-mounting means (10, 12) for enabling the stud to

be secured in the underside of the article and from
which a ground-engaging nose (20) projects, the

stud-mounting means comprising a moulded plastics
body (11), characterised in that undersurfaces of the

body are shielded from engagement with the ground by a
wear-resistant lamina (30) secured to overlie those

surfaces.
A stud according to claim 1 in which portions of
the wear-resistant lamina (30) are interposed between

the nose (20) and the body (11).
A stud according to claim 2 in which the
lamina (30) is an otherwise loose element which is held

secured against the body (11) by the nose (20).
A stud according to any one of claims 1 to 3 in
which the lamina (30) is of metal.
A stud according to any one of claims 1 to 4 in
which the stud-mounting body (11) comprises an

externally threaded spigot (16) and a broad flange (18)
which is arranged to engage undersurfaces of the

article when the spigot is secured in a socket in the
article, the lamina (30) overlying undersurfaces of the

moulded flange (18).
A stud according to claim 5 in which the
lamina (30) is interlocked with the flange (18) to

enable torque to be transmitted from the lamina to the
body (11) in inserting or removing the stud into or

from the socket. 
A stud according to claim 6 in which the
lamina (30) interacts with the moulded flange (18) at

keying formations (36, 40) which enable a suitable
torque-transmitting tool to be applied.
