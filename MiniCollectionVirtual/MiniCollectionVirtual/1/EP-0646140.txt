<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for polymerizing olefins at high pressures in a polymerization medium at high temperature utilizing an ionic olefin polymerization catalyst derived from the reaction of a cyclopentadienyl-containing transition metal compound having a hydrolyzable alkyl or hydride ligand with an ion exchange activator. The ionic catalyst system has been found to be highly active at temperatures of 160  DEG C or greater, to provide a process capable of producing polymer products of desired chemical and physical properties at high production rates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved
polymerization process. Particularly, this
invention provides a high temperature process for
polymerizing ethylenically unsaturated olefin(s) or
unsaturated monomer(s), including cyclic monomers,
either alone or in combination with other monomers,
in a polymerization medium at elevated pressures.
More specifically, this invention relates to a
process for polymerizing olefins at high pressures
in a polymerization medium at high temperature
utilizing an ionic olefin polymerization catalyst
derived from the reaction of a cyclopentadienyl-containing
transition metal compound having a
hydrolyzable alkyl or hydride ligand with an ion
exchange activator composition as described in EPA
277003 and EPA 277004. The ionic catalyst system
has been found to be highly active at temperatures
of 160°C or greater, and provides a process capable
of producing polymer products of desired chemical
and physical properties at a greater production rate
than possible with alumoxane activated catalyst
systems heretofore used under similar temperature
and pressure conditions. In the process of the
invention separation of polymer product from the
polymerization medium with recycle of the medium for 
reuse in polymer production is economically
simplified.Polyolefins, particularly polyethylene,
polypropylene and α-olefin copolymers of ethylene
and propylene, have heretofore been produced by a
variety of processes ranging from solvent, slurry
and gas phase polymerization processes which are
carried out over wide ranges of temperature and
pressure. The polymerization reaction of such
processes have been conducted with a wide range of
catalyst compositions ranging from conventional
Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems to alumoxane
activated metallocene catalyst systems as described
in European Patent No. 0,129,368 to the more
recently disclosed ionic catalyst systems as
described in European Patent Applications 0 277 004
and 0 277 003.In solvent processes, polymerization of
monomers occurs in the medium of a solvent,
typically an inert hydrocarbon such as hexane,
heptane or toluene, which carries the
catalyst into contact with monomer dissolved therein
and typically the medium is one in which the product
polymer is soluble. The solvent medium absorbs the
heat generated by the polymerization reaction and
control of the solvent medium temperature controls
the temperature of reaction whereby optimum
productivity or polymer properties may be achieved
according to the characteristic of the catalyst
used.
