<ABSTRACT>
A disk recording and reproducing apparatus which realizes a simultaneous 
monitoring function with a recording function with a simple pickup system is disclosed. 

The apparatus comprises a recording and reproducing head (230,310), a first memory 
(202) for receiving and storing input signals at a first rate and supplying the stored 

signals at a second rate higher than the first rate so as to be recorded onto the disk 
medium (300) at the second rate by means of the recording and reproducing head 

(230,310), a second memory (213) for receiving and storing signals reproduced at the 
second rate by means of the recording and reproducing head (230,310) and outputting 

the stored signals at a rate lower than the second rate, and a controller (500) for 
controlling the recording and reproducing head (230,310) to relatively scan a same 

portion of the disk medium (300) twice for a predetermined period of time so that 
recording and reproduction occur alternately and successively at the portion of the disk 

medium (300) for each predetermined number of blocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disk recording and
reproducing apparatus in which recording monitoring
(simultaneous recording and monitoring) can be performed
with a single pickup system, and more particularly to a
disk recording and reproducing apparatus suitably
applied to a master recording apparatus for producing a
cutting master disk which is an original disk to be used
to manufacture a large number of compact disks (CDs) or
mini disks (MDs) in a musical disk manufacturing
factory.When it is tried to manufacture a large number
of compact disks or mini disks in a musical disk
manufacturing factory, a recording medium for a cutting
master which is an original for such compact disks or
mini disks must be prepared. Normally, a magnetic tape
is used as the recording medium. FIG. 36 shows an
outline of a conventional master recording apparatus
which is used to produce an original. Referring to FIG. 36, the master recording
apparatus 10 includes a multi-channel tape recorder 11
by which original musical signals are recorded.
Normally, a digital video tape recorder (U-matic video
tape recorder) is used as the multi-channel tape
recorder 11, and an original sound tape on which musical
signals are recorded is produced. Musical signals are
recorded in a plurality of, for example, 24, channels on
the original sound tape, and the musical signals from
the original sound tape are converted into 2-channel
signals and recorded onto a master tape by means of a
master recorder 12.The master tape is supplied to an editing
apparatus 13, on which editing processing necessary for
conversion of data into data of a format conforming to a
type of a disk to be cut or some other factor is
performed to produce a master tape for final cutting.
Using the master tape for cutting, corresponding disks
such as compact disks or cassette tapes are manufactured
in a disk manufacturing factory.By the way, as popularization of musical disks
proceeds in recent years, a demand for an original for
disks as a recording medium is increasing. When a disk
is used as an original, original signals can be recorded 
linearly without compressing the same and can be edited
with a single original without destroying the same.Also when a disk is used as an original in place
of a tape, it is convenient if a simultaneous monitoring
function is provided when it is tried to record musical
signals onto the disk.In order to allow edition of a disk, preferably
the disk is a writable or re-writable disk. In order to
realize simultaneous monitoring (referring

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for recording and reproducing signals in data blocks onto and from a
disk medium, comprising:


a recording and reproducing head (230, 310)
first memory means (202) for receiving and storing input signals at a first rate
and supplying the stored signals at a second rate higher than the first rate so as to be

recorded onto the disk medium (300) at the second rate by means of said recording and
reproducing head (230, 310);
second memory means (213) for receiving and storing signals reproduced at the
second rate by means of said recording and reproducing head and outputting the stored

signals at a rate lower than the second rate; characterized by
recording monitoring control means (500) for controlling said recording and
reproducing head (230, 310) to respectively scan a same portion of the disk medium twice

for a predetermined period of time so that recording and reproduction occur
successively in this order at each portion of the disk medium (300) wherein signal portions of a

predetermined number of blocks are alternately recorded and reproduced, and wherein the
second rate is set equal to or higher than 2.5 times the first rate.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the rate at which said second memory
means (213) outputs the stored signals is equal to the first rate.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the second rate is controlled in
accordance with a speed of rotation of the disk medium (300).
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein each of said first (202) and second (213)
memory means includes a buffer memory of the first-in first-out type.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said recording and reproducing head
(230, 310) includes an optical pickup and a magnetic head positioned with the disk

medium (300) interposed therebetween. 
A method of recording and reproducing signals onto and from a disk medium (300),
the signals being supplied to and stored into a first memory (202) at a first rate before it

is recorded onto the disk medium (300), comprising the steps of:

outputting a predetermined number of blocks of the stored signals from said first
memory (202) at a second rate higher than the first rate;
recording the output signal blocks from said first memory (202) onto the disk
medium (300) by means of a recording and reproducing head;
moving said recording and reproducing head (230,310) to a starting position of the
disk medium (300) from which the predetermined number of blocks have been recorded;
reproducing the predetermined number of recorded blocks by means of said
recording and reproducing head (230,310);
storing the reproduced predetermined number of blocks into a second memory (213)
at the second rate;
repeating all of the steps above until the predetermined number of blocks are stored
into the second memory (213) by a plurality of sets; and
outputting each of the plurality of sets of the predetermined number of blocks from
said second memory (213) at a rate lower than the second rate substantially

simultaneously with recording of a following predetermined number of blocks onto the
disk medium (300), wherein the second rate is set equal to or higher than 2.5 times the first rate.
A method according to claim 6, wherein the rate at which said second memory
(213) means outputs the stored signals is equal to the first rate.
A method according to claim 6, wherein the second rate is controlled in accordance
with a speed of rotation of the disk medium (300).
A method according to claim 6 , wherein each of said first (202) and second (213)
memory means includes a buffer memory of the first-in first-out type.
