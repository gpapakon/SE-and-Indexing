<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for measuring the condition of a receiving antenna of a base station in a TDMA radio system, in which TDMA channel structures according to ETSI/GSM recommendation 05.02 are used, by means of test measurements performed in predetermined TDMA time slots. According to the invention, the test measurements are performed, without disturbing the normal operation of the base station and without allocating a traffic channel, during time slots of an IDLE frame of a channel structure TCH/F+SACCH/TF and/or during time slots of an IDLE frame of a channel structure SDCCH/8 according to the ETSI/GSM recommendation 05.02.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and arrangements
for measuring the condition of a base station in
a TDMA radio system, in which are used TDMA channel
structures according to ETSI/GSM recommendation 05.02
(published February 1992), by means of test measurements
performed in predetermined TDMA time slots.One of the most critical factors in radio systems,
for instance in cellular radio telephone systems,
is the quality of a radio link between a base station
and a mobile radio station. The quality of this radio
link is essentially affected by the condition of radio
sections of the base station, i.e. antennas and transceivers.
Therefore, it is important to be able to monitor
the condition of the radio sections of the base
station by various measurements and tests.The condition of the transmitting and receiving
antennas of a base station is typically monitored by
measuring the standing wave ratio thereof, i.e. electrical
matching of the antennas to the remaining part of
the receiver and transmitter system. This has normally
been performed by means of an equipment positioned at
the base station, supplying RF power through an antenna
line to the antenna and measuring the power reflected
from the antenna. The condition of the antenna has been
concluded from the level of the signal reflected from
the antenna. The measurements are usually carried out
at a specific test frequency outside the normal operating
frequency band of the base station, in order to
avoid disturbance to the normal operation of the base
station. Some equipments applying this principle are
described in the Finnish Patent Application 904085 as
well as in the European Patent Application 0 261 828. The condition of transceivers as well as base-band
signal processing units of a base station have been
tested by an equipment looping an RF test signal sent
by a transmitter to a receiver. If the sent test signal
is received error free, the devices to be tested are
assumed to be in a proper condition. In digital radio
systems, it is possible to calculate on the basis of a
comparison between transmitted and received data a Bit
Error Rate (BER), which is below a predetermined limit
value at a base station in a proper condition. The radio
test equipment is typically connected between transmitting
antenna line and receiving antenna line and it has
to convert the test signal from transmission frequency
to reception frequency. Some equipments of this type are
described in the Finnish Patent Application 902624 and
in the PCT Application WO90/06635.New
