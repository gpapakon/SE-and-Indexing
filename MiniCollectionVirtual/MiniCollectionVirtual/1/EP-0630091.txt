<ABSTRACT>
In order to create a distribution box for telecommunications cables, consisting of a base plate and a covering cap, it being possible to provide the base plate with installation aids such as cable wire guides, earthing terminals, cable grip means, cable inlets and the like, which distribution box is constructed in an extremely functional manner with a simple construction and reducing the number of individual parts required, and is simple to handle, it is proposed that the base plate (1) be constructed with a U-shaped cross-section, and comprise a base (3) with an upper and lower end wall (4, 5) in the installed position, that the covering cap (2) likewise be constructed with a U-shaped cross-section and surround the box end wall (6) as well as the two box side walls (7), and in that the covering cap (2) can be connected to the base plate (1) by means of plug and slide fastening means, it being possible to feed the covering cap (2) and the base plate (1) onto one another with their U-shapes crossing over one another and with the mouths of the U-shapes pointing towards one another, and it being possible to lock the covering cap (2) to the base plate (1) by longitudinal displacement of said covering cap (2) parallel to the longitudinal centre axis of its U-shape.

facing one another, can be guided towards one another to 

achieve the correct assembly position, characterised in that 
the cap (2) is connectable with the baseplate (1) by means of 

socket-slide fastening means, whereby the locking together of 
the parts is effected by the longitudinal movement of the cap 

(2) parallel to the longitudinal central axis of its U section 
relative to the baseplate (1). 
Distributor housing according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that, at the free edges of the wall sections of the cap (2) 

forming the side walls (7) of the housing, parallel L-shaped 
recesses (8) are formed, of which one side (9) opens out into 

an opening in the edge and runs parallel to the profiled side 
of the cap (2) which forms the side wall (7), and that at the 

end-wall-free edges or near the end-wall-free edges of the 
base (3) of the baseplate (1), bolt bars (10) or similar  

 
bolting means are formed, onto which the side wall sections of 

the cap (2) with their L-shaped recesses (9) can be fitted and 
locked together with one another by parallel movement of the 

parts. 
Distributor housing according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that at the longitudinal end-wall-free edges 

of the base (3) of the baseplate (1), slots for the free edges 
of the side walls (7) of the cap (2) are formed by wall 

sections (11, 12) running parallel to one another from the 
base (3) up to the cap (2), which have connecting bars (10) 

between the wall sections (11, 12), which serve as bolting 
elements and which cooperate as locking means with the L-shaped 

recesses (8) of the side walls (7) of the cap (2). 
Distributor housing according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the end walls (4, 5) of the baseplate 

(1) form supporting surface areas (14) at their free ends for 
the edges of the housing end-wall section of the cap (2), 

whose surface extension in the direction in which the cap (2) 
slides is slightly larger than the path along which the cap 

(2) moves. 
Distributor houbing according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the first surface areas (14) are delimited by projecting 

second surface areas (15), of which the height of projection 
over the first surface areas (14) is equal to the thickness of 

the end wall (6) of the cap (2). 
Distributor housing according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a locking means (16) is mounted on the
