<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses a method for applying an 
isocyanate material substantially uniformly onto the surface of a cured 

elastomeric material to improve the bond strength of bonds created on 
that surface. The method comprises of exposing the elastomeric 

surface to a vapor of isocyanate material causing the isocyanate to 
deposit onto the elastomeric surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field to which this invention pertains is bonding 
elastomeric materials. The following processes are typical of the manufacture of a 
solid propellant rocket motor: (1) fabrication of the motor case, (2) 
insulation of the interior of the case, (3) application of a "liner" to the 
surface of the insulation to ensure bonding to the propellant grain, (4) 
casting of the uncured propellant into the motor and against the liner, 
and (5) curing the propellant grain. The motor case, which serves as a pressure vessel, is 
constructed of lightweight material (metal or fiber composite) that 
provides adequate strength only at relatively low temperature. The 
function of the insulation is to protect the case from being weakened 
by exposure to the hot gases formed during combustion of the solid 
propellant. Generally the insulation is applied to the interior of the 
motor case in the form of an uncured elastomeric material such as 
ethylene-propylene (EPDM) or nitrile rubber containing particulate, 
solid, refractory filler. The insulation is then cured, generally under 
pressure by application of moderate heat. The composition of the liner and techniques for its application 
depend in part on the nature of the insulation but mainly on the 
composition of the propellant that will be cast against it. These 
matters are discussed in greater detail below. The uncured propellant typically consists of a viscous 
suspension of particulate solids (e.g., ammonium perchlorate oxidizer, 
nitramines, powdered aluminum fuel, and minor amounts of 
combustion modifiers) in a curable elastomeric binder (e.g., hydroxy 
terminated polybutadiene). After casting, the propellant is cured, 
usually for about one week at temperatures below about 70°C. During  
 
cure the propellant becomes a strong, elastic solid that adheres tightly 
to the liner-coated insulation. The rate at which combustion gases are formed during burning 
of the propellant grain is proportional to the area of the grain that is 
exposed. In turn, the chamber pressure depends on the balance of 
volume of gases generated and gases discharged through the rocket 
nozzle. Thus, to achieve the designed pressure/thrust history, and 
particularly to avoid catastrophic overpressure, it is essential that 
during combustion the propellant grain remain securely bonded to the 
insulator wherever they are in contact. The bond must be strong in 
tension and resistant to peeling. Such bonding is achieved by application of an adhesive liner to 
the surface of the
