<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMUNOASSAYS FOR ANTI-HCN ANTIBODIESTechnical FieldThe present invention pertains generally to viral diagnostics. In particular, the invention relates to immunoassays using multiple HCV antigens, for accurately diagnosing hepatitis C virus infection.Background Of The InventionHepatitis C Virus (HCV) is the principal cause of parenteral non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) which is transmitted largely through body blood transfusion and body fluid exchange. The virus is present in 0.4 to 2.0% ofthe general population in the United States. Chronic hepatitis develops in about 50% of infections and of these, approximately 20% of infected individuals develop liver cirrhosis which sometimes leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Accordingly, the study and control ofthe disease is of medical importance.HCV was first identified and characterized as a cause of NANBH by Houghten et al. The viral genomic sequence of HCV is known, as are methods for obtaining the sequence. See, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 89/04669; WO 90/11089; and WO 90/14436. HCV has a 9.5 kb positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and is a member ofthe Flaviridae family of viruses. At least six distinct, but related genotypes of HCV, based on phylogenetic analyses, have been identified (Simmonds et al., J. Gen. Virol. (1993) 74:2391-2399). The virus encodes a single polyprotein having more than 3000 amino acid residues (Choo et al., Science (1989) 244:359-362; Choo et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991) 88:2451-2455; Han et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1991) 

 88:1711-1715). The polyprotein is processed co- and post-translationally into both structural and non-structural (NS) proteins.In particular, as shown in Figure 1, several proteins are encoded by the HCV genome. The order and nomenclature ofthe cleavage products ofthe HCV polyprotein is as follows: NH2-C-El-E2-P7-NS2-NS3-NS4a-NS4b-NS5a-NS5b-COOH. Initial cleavage ofthe polyprotein is catalyzed by host proteases which liberate three structural proteins, the N-terminal nucleocapsid protein (termed "core") and two envelope glycoproteins, "El" (also known as E) and "E2" (also known as E2/NS1), as well as nonstructural (NS) proteins that contain the viral enzymes. The NS regions are termed ' NS2, NS3, NS4, NS4a, NS4b, NS5a and NS5b. NS2 is an integral membrane protein with proteolytic activity. NS2, either alone or in combination with NS3, cleaves the NS2- NS3 sissle bond which in turn generates the NS3 N-terminus and releases a large polyprotein that includes both serine protease
