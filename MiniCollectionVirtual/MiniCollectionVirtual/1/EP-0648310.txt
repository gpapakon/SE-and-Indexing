<ABSTRACT>
A composite section consists of a metal section (A) for primarily static purposes, a facing timber component (C, C1) and a plastic component (B) in which the last-mentioned lies between the first two to anchor them and provides facilities for the subsequent dismantling (5c) of the metal section (A) and limited transverse movement (X) between them. A covering flange (7) in one piece with the plastic component (B) makes it possible to fit a seal extruded thereon and protect the timber component in this region. The hanging flanges (5) which at least partly cover the metal section (A) are constructed in such a way that they mate with the plastic or plastic-coated channel (9) for the installation of the fittings in order completely to cover the metal sections (A) in the space (I) formed by the door frame and the wing frame when closed in the region between the seals (7a-8).

Composite profile for the manufacturing of window 
and door frames consisting of a metal profile (A), a 

plastic profile (B) and a wooden profile (C) 
envisaging an anchor mechanism between metal profile 

(A) and plastic profile (B) which, in the case of an 
excess load between these two parts caused for 

instance by differing thermal expansion, will allow 
for transversal as well as longitudinal gliding 

movement in the direction of the profile, and which is 
characterized by the fact that the hook-in flanges (5) 

projecting from the plastic profile (B) inclusive of 
their terminal regions (5d) partially cover the metal 

profile (A) and are accessible from the outside for 
the purpose of subsequent detachment (5c); further 

characterized in that between these two hook-in 
elements said plastic profile (B) is equipped with two 

opposing return flanges (4, 4b, 4a) which allow for 
the composite profile parts (A, B) to be restored 

subsequent to a transversal shift (X) and which during 
the assembling stage are deformed so as to be pressed 

(4c) against a level or angled surface (1c) of the 
metal profile (A) and precisely in the direction 

opposite to that of assembly; further characterized in 
that from this contact surface (1c) of the metal 

profile one flange (1) or two flanges (2) project 
towards the plastic profile (B), these flanges being 

provided with a curved or angled surface (2b, 1b) 
corresponding to the resilient terminal regions (4a) 

of the return flanges and possibly with a limit stop 
(2a, 1a); further characterized by the fact that the 

known, standard installation groove for conventional 
mountings is lined by or consisting of a plastic 

profile (9). 
Composite profile according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the known, standard installation 

groove for conventional mountings is at least 
internally covered by a U-shaped plastic profile (9) 

or at least partially consisting of said profile, the 
inside of the groove being executed according to 

standard whereas the outside and the edge regions of 
the sides of the U-shaped profile (9) are utilized for 

the anchoring or fixing onto the metal profile (A). 
Composite profile according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the free terminal region (5d) of  

 
the hook-in flange (5) abuts on the edge region of one 

side of the U-shaped plastic profile (9) which forms 
or covers the known, standard installation groove, 

whereas the known external weather stripping (8) abuts 
on the edge region of the second side of this U-shaped 

plastic profile (9). 
Composite profile according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the plastic profile (B), in the 

area facing the wooden part (C, C1) of the composite 
profile, is equipped with a covering flange (7) 

covering the wooden area facing the stretch (I) 
between the wing profile and the frame profile or the 

wall (M) into which the window or door is set, and 
further characterized in that this covering flange (7) 

may be provided with an extruded packing strip (7a) or 
envisage a sealing groove. 
Composite profile according to Claim 1,
 
characterized by the fact that a snap-in flange (6) 

projects from the plastic profile (B) toward the 
wooden part (C, C1) in the direction opposite to that 

of the corresponding hook-in flanges (5) connecting 
the metal part (A) with the plastic part (B), for the 

purpose of mounting glass strips (D), joint masking 
strips (E) or compensating strips and/or protection 

strips (C2). 
Composite profile according to Claim 5,
 
characterized in that the glass strips (D) and the 

joint masking strips (E) may be made of wood and 
provided with a hook-in element (10) with snap-in 

device to accommodate the corresponding snap-in flange 
(6) protruding from the plastic profile (B), the 

direction of assembly (10b) being perpendicular to the 
glass sheet's surface (F) or parallel to the strip (D, 

E) supporting surface (11) on the wooden part (C, C1) 
of the composite profile.
