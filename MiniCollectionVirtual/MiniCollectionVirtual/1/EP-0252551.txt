<ABSTRACT>
Detergent and shampoo compositions are disclosed, 
containing a complex of an aryl amine with a fatty acid or 

a phosphate ester. Softening agents consisting of these 

complexes are also disclosed. The softening agents herein 
give excellent through-the-wash softness, without 

impairing the overall cleaning performance on greasy 
stains.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to means of treating 
fibers and fabrics, wherein a complex of aryl amines and 
fatty acids or phosphate esters is used to provide 
softness and anti-static benefits, and wherein the 
softening agent does not impair the overall cleaning 
performance on oily or greasy soils. Detergent 
compositions containing said softening agents are 
disclosed. The compositions herein can be used to clean 
and soften fabrics, and to "condition" fibers, especially 
hair. The use of cationic materials to treat hair in a 
post-shampoo rinse is a well-known cosmetic practice. 
Likewise, the use of softeners to treat fabrics after a 
washing operation is a well-known laundering practice. 
Fabric softeners are, in the main, water-insoluble 
cationic materials that are incompatible with anionic 
detersive surfactants used in most fabric washing 
compositions. For that reason, the softening operation is 
generally carried out in the laundry rinse bath after the  
 
surfactant has been removed from the washing machine. 
This entails additional work for the user. Formulators of fabric laundering compositions have 
long sought means whereby fabric washing and softening 
could be done concurrently. The same is true for shampoo 
formulators, since the problems are rather similar. 
Laundering methods employing clay softeners, mixtures of 
clays and various amine materials and the like, are 
described in the following patents: German 29/64114.3, 
28/57163.3, 24/39541.3, 23/34899.4 and EPO 80200570.2, 
80200877.1 and 80201015.7. The use of mixtures of amines 
and soaps (salt of fatty acids) as through-the-wash 
softeners is disclosed in U.K. Patent 1.514.276. Co-pending EPO Applications 0 133 804 and 0 168 889 
relate to complexes of fatty acids and phosphate esters 
with various fatty amines as fabric softeners and hair 
conditioners. The art also describes the use of various cationic 
materials in sheet form. See U.S. Patent 4.220.562. The art also teaches the softener used of alkyl 
phosphonate and quaternary ammonium compounds. See 
copending EPO Application 0 006 268, filed June 11, 1979. The art also teaches various mixtures of phosphate 
esters in detergents with fabric softening action - See BE 
802,679. The present invention employs novel amine complexes, 
wherein the amine contains an aryl substituent, in laundry 
or shampoo compositions to provide cleaning and softening 
concurrently. The softening agents herein provide 
softening and anti-static benefits, especially when used  
 
with clay
