<ABSTRACT>
Two glutathione thiol derivatives, namely the monomethyl ester and the monoethyl ester of reduced glutathione, are proposed for use as medicaments for a wide range of different indications, also in combination with vitamins, an amino acid or a substance which contains a semiconductor element in inorganically or organically bound form. The proposal is based on the knowledge that many disorders of cell metabolism can be rectified by glutathione therapy and therefore many disorders which are accompanied or caused by the loss of the reductive potential can be cured.
