<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a two-part roller shutter for cabinet-type pieces of furniture. The two roller-shutter elements are constructed of pivotably interconnected profiles and are interconnected by connecting elements. Via said connecting elements, the movement of one roller-shutter element can be transmitted synchronously to the other roller-shutter element in the form of a counter-movement. In the opening region (11) of the piece of furniture (1), guide profiles (2) are arranged on the opposite side walls (12), in the border region. Said guide profiles (2) have two longitudinal grooves (21, 22) which are provided for receiving toothed components (3, 4) and are located one behind the other. Said longitudinal grooves (21, 22) of the guide profiles (2) have slit openings (23, 24) directed parallel to the interior (13) of the piece of furniture (1). The toothed components (3, 4), which are arranged in the longitudinal grooves (21, 22) such that they can be displaced with respect to one another, can be connected via connecting means (5, 6) to in each case one of the roller-shutter elements (7, 8). The spacing between the longitudinal grooves (21, 22) arranged one behind the other is formed by a hollow region (25) in the guide profile (2). Said hollow region (25) is spanned by at least one rotatable gear wheel (9), arranged in a stationary manner on a pin (91), such that the teeth (92) of the gear wheel (9) mesh with the teeth (31, 41) of the toothed components (3, 4).

A two-section tambour door for cabinet-style items of furniture, in which the two
tambour door sections (7, 8) consist of flexibly connected profiles, and in which

the two tambour door sections are joined to each other by means of connecting
elements which enable the motion of one tambour door section to be transferred

synchronously to the other tambour door section so as to produce a counter-motion,
characterised in that it is possible to arrange track profiles (2) on the

opposing side walls (12) around the edges of the open part (11) of the item of
furniture (1), the said track profiles (2) having two serially arranged longitudinal

chambers (21, 22) designed to receive toothed components (3, 4); in that the
longitudinal chambers (21, 22) in the track profiles (2) have slot-type openings

(23, 24) running parallel to the interior (13) of the item of furniture (1); in that
each of the counter-directionally sliding toothed components (3, 4) in the

longitudinal chambers (21, 22) can be connected to one of the tambour door
sections (7, 8) by means of connecting pieces (5, 6); and in that the gap between

the serially arranged longitudinal chambers (21, 22) is formed by a hollow part
(25) ofthe track profile (2), which hollow part is bridged by at least one rotatable

sprocket (9) on a permanently mounted axis (91), the bridging arrangement being
such that the teeth (92) of the sprocket (9) mesh with the teeth (31, 41) on the

toothed components (3, 4).
Tambour doors according to Claim 1, characterised in that the track profile (2)
has a U-shaped, outward-facing moulded rebate (26) in which the free ends of the

tambour door sections (7, 8) are engaged.
Tambour doors according to Claim 2, characterised in that there is a guide web
(27) which projects into the U-shaped rebate (26) and engages in a recess (72, 82)

in the free end ofthe end slat (71, 81) on the tambour door section (7, 8) to act as
a guide. 
Tambour doors according to Claim 1, characterised in that the connecting pieces
(5, 6) are angled brackets, each with one arm mechanically joined to the end slat

(71, 81) of the respective tambour door section (7, 8) and the other arm
mechanically joined to the respective toothed component (3, 4) in the track profile

(2).
Tambour doors according to Claim 1, characterised in that there is at least one

guide lug (27, 28) which projects into the hollow interior of the longitudinal
chamber (21, 22) in the track profile (2) and engages in a longitudinal guide

groove (32, 42) in the respective toothed component (3, 4).
Tambour doors according to one or more of the above Claims, characterised in
that the toothed components (3, 4) are made of metal or plastic.
Tambour doors according to Claim 5, characterised in that the teeth (31, 41) of the
toothed components (3, 4) are punched, sawn or injection moulded.
