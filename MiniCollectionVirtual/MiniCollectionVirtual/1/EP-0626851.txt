<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of 3,5-diamino-6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazine
and its
pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable acid addition
salts in preparation of a medicament for the prevention and treatment of oedema and of specific classes of pain.EP-A-0021121 describes a group of triazines,
including 3,5-diamino-6-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazine,
which are active in the treatment of disorders of
the central nervous system, for example psychiatric and
neurological disorders, and which are particularly useful
as anticonvulsants, for instance in the treatment of
epilepsy. These triazines are non-depressant and are
therefore advantageous compared with depressant antiepileptics
such as phenobarbitone. EP-A-0247892 describes
the salt of these triazines with isethionic acid, a
particularly preferred salt owing to its good solubility.
EP-A-0 459 829 describes structurally related triazines
as inhibitors of glutamate release.One of the commonest symptoms causing a patient to
consult a medical practitioner is pain. Considerable time
and effort have therefore been devoted to investigating the
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of pain and
researching new types of pain management. However, there
is still no single form of satisfactory relief for all
types of pain. There is accordingly a continuing demand
for new and effective analgesics.Relieving pain is not straightforward since the whole
notion of pain embraces phenomena having different 
underlying causative mechanisms and different
manifestations. Pain can arise in different ways, for
example following certain alterations of neurological
structure and function. Metabolic changes associated with
diabetes or mercury poisoning, for instance, may produce a
painful peripheral neuropathy. Viral damage, such as in
Herpes Zoster, late poliomyelitis or Guillian-Barre's
disease, may also produce painful states. Trauma to
peripheral nerves can lead to neuropathic pain from
neuromas, causalgia (a form of neuralgia in which there is
a sensation of localised burning pain) or phantom pain.Current pain management includes treatment with
carbamazepine, and with opioid analgesics such as morphine
and morphine-like drugs, these are typically used to treat
moderate to severe pain. However, one major problem
associated with their use is that tolerance and dependence
can develop in some patients, particularly during chronic
administration.Oedema is the pathological accumulation of fluid in
tissue spaces. It can occur associated with various
clinica
