<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for executing a 
command in a number of electrical metering devices of a 

power distribution system provides each metering device 
with a command having a predetermined execution time 

and subsequently executes the command in each of the 
metering devices once the present time value equals or 

exceeds the predetermined execution time. Each 
electrical metering device includes a clock for 

providing the present time value as well as a memory 
device for receiving and storing the command. Each 

electrical metering device also includes at least one 
controller or microprocessor for monitoring or 

comparing the present time value with the predetermined 
execution time of the stored command and for executing 

the stored command once the present time value is at 
least as large as the predetermined execution time. A 

command may thus be provided to each electrical 
metering device of a power distribution system at 

various prior arbitrary times. The command may 
subsequentially be executed simultaneously in each of 

the electrical metering devices at the predetermined 
execution time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for programming an electrical metering device
and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for
programming a plurality of electrical metering devices.Modern electrical power distribution systems
supply power to a large number of electrical loads,
such as residences, factories or businesses. The power
consumed by each electrical load is separately measured
by an electrical metering device, such as an induction
or electronic type watthour meter. Many electrical
power distribution systems include tens of thousands or
even hundreds of thousands of metering devices.Induction type watthour meters have
historically been utilized to measure electrical energy
consumption. Induction type watthour meters include an
aluminum disk driven as a rotor of a small induction
motor by an electric field at a speed which is
proportional to the electric power consumed by the
load. Geared dials, or cyclometer disks, integrate the
disk's motion to indicate the total energy consumed,
conventionally measured in kilowatt hours.Recently, an increasing number of electronic
type watthour meters have been employed to measure
electrical energy consumption since they are capable of
measuring several quantities in addition to tabulating
the kilowatt hours of power consumed by the
corresponding load. For example, electronic type
watthour meters can measure the power factor, kilovolt 
amperes ("KVA"), and reactive volt amperes of the power
consumed. The increased metering flexibility and
capacity provided by electronic type watthour meters is
due, at least in part, to the electronic acquisition,
integration and processing of the measured electrical
consumption of the load by, for example, an electronic
processor or controller.The total electrical power demand upon most
power distribution systems is cyclical throughout each
day with one or more peaks in the demand for electrical
energy. The cyclical electrical energy demand is
relatively consistent such that the peaks in electrical
energy demand occur at substantially the same time each
day. Likewise, the off-peak time periods also occur at
relatively the same times of each day. Thus, many
suppliers of electrical power charge more for
electrical energy consumption during the peak periods
of time during a day than during the off-peak periods
to reflect the increased cost of supplying the power
during the peak periods.Due to their electronic processing
capabilities, electronic type watthour meters readily
provide time of use
