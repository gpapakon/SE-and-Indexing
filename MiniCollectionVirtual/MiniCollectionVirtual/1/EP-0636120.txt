<ABSTRACT>
A process for transforming a carbonyl compound into its corresponding epoxide, which comprises contacting the carbonyl compound with either trimethylsulphonium hydrogen sulphate and/or bis(trimethylsulphonium) sulphate or trimethylsulphoxonium hydrogen sulphate and/or bis(trimethylsulphoxonium) sulphate, in the presence of a base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of trimethylsulphonium hydrogen sulphate
and its use to make epoxides from carbonyl compounds. The invention further relates to
processes for preparation of sulphonium ylide, (CH3)2S+--CH2 and the use of this intermediate
and a process for the preparation of fungicides and insecticides using this intermediate.It is well known to prepare epoxides from carbonyl compounds using sulphonium or
sulphoxonium salts. In particular, it is known to react dimethyl sulphide with dimethyl
sulphate in an organic solvent, and then to contact the trimethylsulphonium methylsulphate so
formed with a carbonyl compound in the presence of a strong base to form an epoxide. This
epoxidation reaction is believed to proceed via the intermediate generation of the sulphonium
ylide, (CH3)2S+--CH2 or sulphoxonium ylide, (CH3)2S+(O)--CH2. A disadvantage of the
known process is that organic material, in the form of an alkali metal methylsulphate, is
present in the effluent. As well as being environmentally undesirable, methylating agent is lost
and this is chemically inefficient. A further disadvantage is that dimethyl sulphate is a
carcinogen.The reaction of organic sulphides with organic sulphates to form sulphonium
compounds is disclosed in Journal of Organic Chemistry (1943) 8 391-6.The present invention provides a process for preparing trimethylsulphonium
hydrogen sulphate:
a) in which dimethyl sulphide, methanol and sulphuric acid are reacted at a
temperature of from -20°C to +100°C (in a sealed system) or from -20°C to
+40°C (at atmospheric pressure); orb) which comprises reacting a trimethylsulphonium halide, sulphuric acid and
hydrogen peroxide at a temperature of from 0°C to 100°C.
Trimethylsulphonium hydrogen sulphate has the formula (CH3)3S+.HSO4-.The compound trimethylsulphonium hydrogen sulphate is mentioned by name in
Czechoslovakian Patent No 254,032 but no method or reference is given in that document for
its preparation.In step (a) suitably, from 1 to 10 moles of dimethylsulphide, normally about 2 moles,
and from 1 to 10 moles of sulphuric acid, normally from 1 to 2 moles, are used for each mole
of methanol. The dimethyl sulphide, before it is consumed in the reaction, and any excess 
used will act as a solvent. Excess sulphuric acid will require to be neutralised at the
epoxidation stage by the addition of extra base.In a typical preparation, the methanol is added slowly, for example dropwise, to a
molar excess of dimethyl sulphide, for instance, 2 moles of dimethyl sulphide
