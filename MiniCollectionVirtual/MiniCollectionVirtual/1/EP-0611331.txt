<ABSTRACT>
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process and apparatus for the growth of diamond films using vapor mixtures of selected compounds having precursors that provide carbon and etchant species that removes graphite are disclosed. The selected compounds are reacted in a CVD apparatus in a plasma created by a confined rf discharge to produce diamond films on a substrate on susceptor (8). The plasma is confined in a reaction tube (9) between an inductive rf coil (2) via matching network (6). A gaseous mixture including at least 20 % water, providing an etchant species, is reacted with an alcohol, providing the carbon, at low temperature (300-650  DEG C) and low pressure (0.1 to 10 Torr), preferably in the presence of an organic acid (acetic acid) which contributes etchant species. In the preferred embodiment the volumetric mixtures have typically been 40-80 % water and 60-20 % alcohol. The gaseous mixture of H2O and alcohol is disassociated to produce H, OH, and carbon radicals. Both OH and atomic H are capable of etching graphite from the depositing carbon layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for chemical vapor 
deposition of diamond films. Deposition of diamond films using CVD techniques has been 
well established. Numerous workers have used a plethora of 
techniques and source gases for diamond growth [see T.R. 
Anthony in Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 162, 61 (1990) or see 
also P.K. Bachmann et al. in Diamond and Related Materials 1, 
1 (1991)). The techniques have included microwave-plasma 
assisted, hot filament assisted, dc plasma assisted, arc-jet 
discharges, rf plasma assisted, and oxy-acetylene-torch CVD 
techniques. The vast majority of the work depends on 
molecular hydrogen dissociation/activation in high-temperature 
plasma regions or in equivalent high temperature regions such 
as a hot filament or an oxy-acetylene torch. As a consequence 
of the sample temperature being much lower than the source 
temperature, there exists a super-equilibrium of atomic 
hydrogen at the diamond growth surface. Thus, diamond growth 
proceeds once a sufficient amount of atomic hydrogen is 
produced. One role of the atomic hydrogen is to dissolve any 
graphite from the depositing diamond layer. Some of the 
earliest and simplest theories of diamond growth hypothesized  
 
that diamond CVD growth was a codeposition process involving 
the deposition of both graphite and diamond but in which the 
graphite was dissolved preferentially, resulting in 
stabilization of the diamond phase. Thus, providing an 
effective graphite etchant to dissolve graphite from a 
depositing diamond layer is critical in any diamond CVD 
process. Another role of the atomic hydrogen is to promote 
diamond formation through stabilization of the surface of 
diamond. Additional insight into the thermodynamics of 
diamond deposition has been provided by W.A. Yarbrough whose 
quasi-equilibrium calculations have shown that, at high 
fractions of atomic hydrogen (greater than 0.1%), diamond 
condensation is preferred over graphite (see W.A. Yarbrough in 
Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 192, 75 (1990) ]. Hence, diamond 
deposition techniques need to generate a high fraction of 
atomic hydrogen to insure diamond promotion over graphite. In 
addition, with the deposition process involving carbon atom 
addition per unit time, the deposition process must also 
provide a critical absolute atomic hydrogen flux per unit time 
in order to stabilize the instantaneous growth surface. It is 
clear that, in practice, the high-temperature extremes of 
these physical and chemical sources are necessary in order to 
pro
