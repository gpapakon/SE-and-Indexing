<ABSTRACT>
In a spreading vehicle for distributing spreadable material, the hydraulic motor (3) which drives the ejecting element (4) is driven by a hydraulic pump (5) dependent upon the travelling speed. In order to reduce the reduction of the spreading range on stopping and starting the vehicle, where the hydraulic pump (5) does not attain the normal delivery value, provision is made in the hydraulic line for a pressure accumulator which is able to compensate for the loss of pump capacity over a short time.
