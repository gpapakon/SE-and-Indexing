<ABSTRACT>
Instead of the conventional round powder-compression electrodes with nickel wire-mesh sheathing, a button cell (12) contains (in a flat cylindrical housing) box-shaped or hexagonal electrodes (13, 13') which, without any significant material wastage, can be cut out of a continuously produced rolled strip with a metal mesh covering. The mesh coverings (20) face the housing bowl (16) or the cover (17) when the electrodes are fitted. The free space which remains between the electrode edges and the round cell inner boundary is available as a collection space for electrolyte and is favourable for gas dissipation.

<CLAIMS>
Button cell which contains arranged one above the other 
in a gas-tight housing of truncated cylindrical shape at least 

one positive and one negative electrode having an interposed 
separator and an electrolyte, with the anode being cut or 

punched in polygonal form from a strip material, characterised 
in that the anode and the cathode are manufactured from strip 

material which is formed by rolling together a rolled strip 
of active mass powders compressed in a roller mill and a strip 

of woven or expanded metal, with the anode and the cathode 
being of square or hexagonal form. 
Button cell according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the expanded metal comprises nickel or nickel-plated steel. 
Button cell according to Claim(s) 1 and/or 2, 
characterised in that it contains a positive nickel hydroxide 

electrode, a negative cadmium or hydrogen storage electrode 
and an alkaline electrolyte. 
Button cell according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the layer of woven or expanded metal of 

each electrode faces the cover or base of the housing. 
Button cell according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the strip of woven or expanded metal is 

additionally coated with a mixture of activated carbon, 
conductive carbon black and a hydrophobic binder. 
Button cell according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that there is provided on the housing thereof 

a predetermined break point in the form of a groove-shaped 
weakness in the wall of the housing.
