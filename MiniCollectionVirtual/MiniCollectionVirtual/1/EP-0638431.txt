<ABSTRACT>
The object of the current invention is to print characters, for example, on a 
substantially full area of a recording medium (30) extended up to the leading (32) or 

trailing (34) edge of the recording medium. A carriage (10) is moved so that a print 
hole (15) of a ribbon mask (14) is positioned at a medium center as viewed in the 

direction of feeding of a recording medium. The recording medium is fed to a position 
so that the print hole is at a print start position. A print operation is carried out toward a 

first side edge of the recording medium. The recording medium is then fed in the 
reverse direction to a position where the print hole is away from the recording medium 

as viewed in the character pitch direction. The carriage is then moved so that the print 
hole is positioned at a medium center as viewed in the direction of feeding of a recording 

medium. Thereafter, the medium is fed to a position so that the print hole is at a print 
start position. A print operation is then carried out toward a second side of the recording 

medium. A similar operation may be carried out to print on the trailing edge of a 
recording medium. Thus, characters may be printed on the leading or trailing edge of 

the recording medium without catching any of the corners of the recording medium on 
the print hole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method
of controlling a carriage and a paper feed in a printer.
More particularly, the invention relates to a method of
controlling a carriage and a paper feed in a printer, which
enables characters to be printed on a substantially full area
of a recording medium including the leading or trailing edge
thereof without the print head catching on the leading or
trailing edge or corners of the recording medium.A printer generally includes a carriage, a print head
mounted on the carriage, a ribbon mask mounted on the
carriage, and an ink ribbon which is fed between a recording
medium and a print hole formed in the ribbon mask on the
front of the print head. Objects, or characters, are printed
on the recording medium through the print hole. This type of
printer, called a dot matrix printer, is well known in the
prior art.FIGS. 7(a) and 7(b) show a portion of a prior art dot
matrix printer and the relationship of a print hole 1 of a
ribbon mask and a recording medium 2 in a dot matrix printer.
Reference numeral 3 designates wires driven forward out of
the head.In the prior art printer, when the carriage and a
paper feed are controlled so that the printing operation 
starts from the leading end 2b of recording medium 2, a
corner part 2a of recording medium 2 may catch in print hole
1 as it advances in the direction of Arrow A. As a result,
the recording medium may be broken or the printer may work
improperly.Also in the printer of the type not having the ink
ribbon and the ribbon mask, such as an ink jet printer, if
corner part 2a of recording medium 2 is curled, the printing
operation will progress so that the print head pushes up the
curled corner 2a of recording medium 2, and the print head
lies under curled corner 2a of recording medium 2.To prevent print hole 1 from catching corner part 2a
of recording medium 2, the conventional art controls the
carriage and the paper feed so that the printing operation
starts from a position where print hole 1 is located below
leading edge 2c of recording medium 2, as shown in FIG. 8.
As a result, the following problems are encountered.As shown in FIG. 8, the upper end of print hole 1 and
wire 3a located at the highest position are spaced a distance
L from leading edge 2c of recording medium 2. As a result,
it is impossible to print characters on the area of recording
medium 2 within this distance L of leading edge 2c of
recording medium 2. If it is attempted to print a character
in this area within the distance L of the

A method of controlling a print head (12) and a recording medium feed in a
printer, the recording medium (30) having a leading edge (32) between two corners (31)

and two side edges (33) comprising the steps of:

moving the print head and the recording medium relatively so that the front end
of the print head is positioned at a print start position located between and away from

said corners of the recording medium;
carrying out a print operation from the print start position on or adjacent the
leading edge of the recording medium toward a first side edge of the recording medium;
moving the print head and the recording medium relatively so that the front end
of the print head bypasses a corner of the recording medium, and is returned to the

print start position on or adjacent the leading edge of the recording medium; and
carrying out a print operation from the print start position on the leading edge of
the recording medium toward a second side edge of the recording medium,

whereby objects to be printed are printed on or adjacent the leading edge of the
recording medium.
A method of controlling a print head (12) and a recording medium feed in a
printer, the recording medium (30) having a trailing edge (34) between two corners (31)

and two side edges (33), comprising the steps of:

moving a print head and a recording medium relatively so that the front end of
the print head is positioned at a print start position on a trailing edge of the recording

medium, the print start position being located away from said comers of the recording
medium;
carrying out a print operation from the print start position on the trailing edge of
the recording medium toward a first side edge of the recording medium; 
moving a print head and the recording medium relatively so that the front end of
the print head bypasses a corner of the recording medium, and is returned to the print

start position on the trailing edge of the recording medium; and
