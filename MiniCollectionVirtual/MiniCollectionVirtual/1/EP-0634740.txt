<ABSTRACT>
An MR transducer (70) is disclosed having passive 
end regions (71) separated by a central active 

region (77) in which an MR layer (81) is 
formed over substantially only the central active region and in which a 

magnetic bias layer (75,79) is formed in each passive end region. In one 
embodiment, each of the magnetic bias layers includes a layer of 

ferromagnetic material (79) and a layer of 
antiferromagnetic material (75) 

overlaying and in contact with the ferromagnetic layer to provide an 
exchange-coupled magnetic bias field. Alternatively a hard magnetic 

material is used to form the biasing layer. Each of the magnetic bias 
layers form an abutting junction (87) having magnetic and electrical 

continuity with the MR layer to produce a stable longitudinal magnetic 
bias field in the transducer, even when the length of the active region 

is small to accommodate small track widths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to thin film magnetic
transducers and, more particularly, to magnetic transducers having a
magnetoresistive read transducer arranged such that a longitudinal bias
field is produced in end regions of the transducer.The use of magnetoresistive (MR) sensors to sense magnetically
recorded data is well-known in the art. It is also well-known that both
longitudinal and transverse bias fields must be provided in the MR
sensing element to eliminate Barkhausen noise and to maintain the sensor
in its most linear operating range. Commonly assigned U.S. Patents Nos.
4,024,489; 3,840,898 and 4,103,415 discuss and disclose MR sensors in
which various biasing schemes utilizing both hard or soft magnetic
materials and/or exchange coupling provide the transverse and
longitudinal magnetic bias fields required in the MR element.It has become increasingly difficult to fabricate MR read
transducers in the small physical size required to read data recorded on
ever decreasing track widths at ever increasing linear recording density.
One solution proposed to meet these requirements is described in commonly
assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,663,685 in which a transverse bias field is
produced in only a central active region of the MR sensor element and a
longitudinal bias field is produced in the inactive end regions by means
of exchange coupling between the portions of the ferromagnetic MR element
which extends into the end regions and layers of antiferromagnetic
material which extend only over the end regions of the MR element. U.S.
Patent No. 4,639,806 discloses an MR sensor which provides a longitudinal
bias field produced by ferromagnetic exchange coupling between the MR
layer and hard magnetic layers in the sensor end regions only. Commonly
assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,079,035 discloses an MR sensor in which the
ferromagnetic MR element extends over only the central active region of
the sensor. A layer of hard magnetic material is provided in each of the
sensor end regions which form an abutting junction with the ends of the
HR element to provide a longitudinal magnetic bias field in the sensor.
The central active region includes the MR element, a non-magnetic spacer
layer and an adjacent soft magnetic layer which provides a transverse
magnetic bias field for the sensor. The MR sensor design described in patent no. 5,079,035 has been
shown to meet present requirements and provides numerous advantages,
including data track definition by a single photolithography process
step, controllable and
