<ABSTRACT>
Hooking and restraining structure for anchoring seal 
and back stop gaskets between sections and accessories 

for door- and window frames and the like made from 
extruded sections from aluminium and its alloys, constituted 

by a continuous channel-shaped seat, having a 
substantially U-shaped through-section, obtained on the 

sides and the flanges of an unusual section for door-and 
window frames and the like, and provided with a 

shaped flange running along the longitudinal edge of at 
least one of the flanges of said seat, the channel-shaped 

cavity of said seat being suitable to pressure-housing 
the peduncle or stem of a continuous gasket 

having the part outside the seat variously shaped, so 
as to provide a set of seal and back stop gaskets, said 

flanges protruding outwards of said seat constituting, 
on the contrary, as many means for the stable hooking 

of sections with other sections and/or accessories of 
door- and window frames and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
Object of this invention is to provide a pressure-hooking
structure for seal and back stop gaskets and
for the connection of accessory to various sections,
particularly suited for extruded metal sections, such
as hollow sections from aluminium and its alloys,
utilized for door- and window frames and the like.As is known, metal doors and windows with openable
shutters, French windows sliding on rails and the like
need for the sealing between the frame and the glass
pane-holding casing and between the frame and the glass
full-height gaskets to allow an efficacious seal
against weathering and to ensure the necessary thermal
and acoustic insulation; other types of gaskets are
also required as back stop elements for the shutters
and for locking and sealing glass pans through various
types of glass stops.According to the known techniques, the full-height
seats for the stable housing of a gasket are obtained
during the extrusion of the section in various positions,
i. e. either on the walls of the quadrangular
hollow body of the section or on the usual flange
normally protruding coplanary from the opposing walls.
shorter than the through-section of the section.Generally, said seats are constituted by grooves or
throats having a substantially constant C-shaped
through-section, which protrudes from the wall or 
flanges of the section and which develops for the whole
height of the section. Therefore, the various continuous
gaskets are fitted in the "C"-shaped seats,
starting from an end of the section, and the restraint
is ensured by the part enclosed in the seat, while the
part which protrudes outside it is the real gasket
which may have different shapes and sizes according to
the function required.These types of axial-plug-in gaskets have in practice
the drawback that one cannot remove and replace them,
when they have deteriorated, without disassembling the
section from the other sections which compose the frame
of the glass pane-holding casing, i.e. without separating
the section which holds the gasket to allow to
take it out from an end of same.On the other hand, the "plug-in" gaskets for frames are
at present nonconform with the regulations, and the
plug-in hooking system must be replaced by systems that
do not require the disassembly of the frame or the
shutter.CH-A-406592 (KUENTZ) discloses a gasket made of elastic
material having a peduncle provided with lateral
longitudinal protrusions fitted in a channel-shaped
seat, said channel seat having a rectangular or a
dovetail or similar shaped

<CLAIMS>
A door-and window frame composed by extruded hollow
sections from alluminium and its alloys comprising a

hooking and gasket restraining as well
as connecting metal sections (2, 3) and/or accessories structure constituted by a continuous channel-shaped

seat (1) having a constant substantially "U"-shaped
through-section

and comprising also a set of continuous gaskets, characterized
in that said channel- "U"-shaped seat (1)

positioned on the sides and on the flanges of said
sections (2, 3) is provided with a flange (1a, 1b)

shaped at right angle in respect of the wings of said
seat (1) protruding externally towards the outside of

the seat (1) and running longitudinally along the edge
of at least one of said wings, the channel-shaped

cavity of said seat (1) being suitable to pressure-house
the peduncle or stem (4) of said continuous

gaskets whose part outside the seat is variously shaped
so as to provide a set of seal and back stop gaskets,

said protruding flange (la, 1b) constituting means for
the stable hooking of the sections with other sections

and/or accessories of door-and window frames.
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that
said gaskets are provided all with the relevant peduncles

or stems (4), pressure-insertable into said "U"-shaped
seat (1), provided peripherally with transversal 

protrusions (5) having a substantially rounded shape.
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that
some of these gaskets have the part that protrudes from

the relevant stem shaped as a yielding arch (6b, 7d,
10b, 12c) or have a tubular shape (11b), so as to

constitute a back stop or seal element against other
sections or accessories of a structure composed of

hollow sections.
A frame according to claim 2, characterized in that
said gaskets are made from plastic material chosed

among polyvinylchloride, polyetylene, polypropylene,
ABS, fluorinated rubbers or combinations of the same.
A frame according to claim 1, characterized in that
at least one of said gaskets is constituted by a peduncle

from plastic material coextruded with a flexible
rubber as concerns the external bent part of said

gasket.
