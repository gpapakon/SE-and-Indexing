adapted to be interfaced with a synchronous DRAM (22) which 

can be accessed in synchronism with a clock signal (CLK), a 
plurality of data processing modules (12, 13) coupled to said 

bus control circuit (14) for producing data and addresses for

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data processing
system particularly for image processing in the field
of an information terminal such as a personal computer
or a workstation for processing the image data allocated
on a memory and, more particularly, to a technique
which is effective when applied to a high-speed
image processing system for accessing a memory at a
high speed in synchronism with a clock.In an image processing system, a drawing display
processor executes a drawing processing upon a frame
buffer in accordance with drawing commands or parameters
transferred from a CPU. This drawing display
processor may execute the drawing processing in accordance
with the drawing commands or parameters which
are arranged in advance in the frame buffer or a special
purpose local memory. Moreover, the drawing display
processor reads out the necessary display data 
from the frame buffer in accordance with the horizontal
and vertical synchronizing timings and the dot
rate of the monitor and displays them on the monitor
through a dot shifter. The clock generator produces a
fundamental clock and a dot clock on the basis of the
reference frequency of a quartz oscillator and feeds
them to the drawing display processor and the dot
shifter. As the frame buffer of such image processing
system, there can be adopted a DRAM (i.e., Dynamic
Random Access Memory) or a multi-port DRAM which is
given such a large storage capacity as is required for
the bit map arrangement of the display data.In the image processing system used in a facsimile,
a printer or a graphic device of the prior
art, on the other hand, there are used a high-speed
SRAM (i.e., Static Random Access Memory) as a local
processing referring to peripheral pixels, as disclosed
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 261969/1986,
and a DRAM as a large-capacity memory for storing code
data and font data.In the trends of the field of the information
terminal device of recent years such as a personal
computer or workstation for business uses, the high 
quality, operation speed and capacity are advanced to
increase the data bus width in case the frame buffer
is constructed of a standard DRAM. In another constructed
adopted, the drawing processing efficiency is
improved by constructing the frame buffer of the multi
-port DRAM. In accordance with this, there arises a
problem that the cost for the system rises.On the other hand, the synchronous DRAM has been
noted as a large-capacity memory. This synchronous
DRAM can input/output data, addresses and control signals
in
