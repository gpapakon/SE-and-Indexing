<ABSTRACT>
The mould, to form the tread of a pneumatic tyre, has a number of standard and intermediate moulding components round the circumference. An alignment system acts on the intermediate components to set their orientation on the radial direction. The mould is opened up through the gaps between the components.

<CLAIMS>
A mould for a tyre tread, comprising a laminated peripheral
crown for moulding the outside of the tread, said laminated peripheral crown

consisting of a stack in the circumferential direction of a number of adjacent
elements (1) of low thickness mounted on a support, said elements being

oriented substantially radially and arranged in such a way that there is elastic
repulsion between elements (1), said elastic repulsion being contained by a

hoop, the axial movement of which controls the radial movement of said
elements, said tread being moulded by the radially inside edge face of said

elements, said radially inside edge face having the desired profile,

characterised in that
 said elements comprise standard elements and
intermediate elements which follow on from one another circumferentially, and


in that
 the mould comprises alignment means interacting with said
intermediate elements in order to impose the orientation of said intermediate

elements with respect to the radial direction.
A mould according to Claim 1, wherein said alignment means
comprise slots formed in said support and into which said intermediate

elements (1I) are inserted.
A mould according to Claim 2, wherein the slots are on a ring
mounted on said hoop, between projections (71) arranged on the radially

inside part of said ring, the radially outside part of said intermediate elements
(1l) being inserted into these said slots.
A mould according to Claim 1, wherein said guide means are
grooves made in said support and into which said intermediate elements are

inserted. 
A mould according to Claim 4, wherein each of the elements has
a lateral extension arranged radially toward the inside of the elements, said

mould comprising a member for guiding the elements, said grooves being cut
in said guide member to accommodate said lateral extension of the

intermediate elements (11).
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein a number of
groups of one or more adjacent intermediate elements split said crown into

substantially uniform sectors, the standard elements being arranged between
said groups of intermediate elements.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that

the crown is split into two parts (G and D), 
in that
 the crown comprises,
transversely, two separate and adjacent elements (1D and 1G) each

belonging to one of the parts, each having an edge (18) intended to come into
contact on the other part with the corresponding edge (18) of the adjacent

element belonging to said other part.
A mould according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that

each element (1) has a thickness of between 0.1 mm and 5 mm, and 
in that

the end (10) on the moulding edge-face side of said elements (1) has a
thickness that decreases gradually as it progresses radially toward the axis of

the mould.
A method of manufacturing a tyre, 
characterised in that
 use is
made of a mould according to one of Claims 1 to 8, in which the mould is

vented by means of the spaces between elements.
