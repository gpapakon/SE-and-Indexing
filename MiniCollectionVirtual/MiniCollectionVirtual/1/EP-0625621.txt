<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for laying concrete slabs by applying free-flowing or moist concrete onto a backing layer, for example a sand or gravel layer. The method is characterised in that the temperature of the heating concrete is kept at approximately the same level as the temperature of the backing layer by increasing the heat dissipation in the direction of the backing layer by raising the thermal conductivity and/or the temperature of the backing-layer flow-off surface (A) which is available for the heat dissipation (Q) is kept at approximately the same level as the temperature of the backing layer.

Method for laying concrete slabs by applying 
flowable or moist concrete to a supporting layer 

consisting of a sand and/or gravel layer, characterised 
in that the temperature of the concrete which is 

warmed up on the placing of the concrete slab on 
the supporting layer is thereby maintained at the 

same level as the temperature of the supporting 
layer, that the heat flow from the concrete in the 

direction of the supporting layer is increased by 
increasing the thermal conductivity of the supporting 

layer, in that the supporting layer can be saturated 
with a fluid, in particular water, and its thermal 

conductivity is increased by saturating with water 
at a temperature of approx. 12°C to 15°C. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the quantity of water necessary for saturating 

the supporting layer is approx. 20 1 to 30 1 per 
square metre of the surface. 
Process according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the diffusion surface (A) 

of the supporting surface available for the heat 
flow (Q) is increased, in that the grain size of 

the supporting layer is reduced in comparison with 
the particle size distribution curve of normal gravel.
