<ABSTRACT>
A mixing device for oil or gas burner with a mixing pipe (1) with an end-side passage opening (3), an annular baffle plate (10), arranged upstream in the direction of flow in front of the passage opening (3), with radial slots (12), and a cylindrical casing (11) facing towards the passage opening (3) of the mixing pipe (1). Furthermore, a nozzle (4) and at least one ignition electrode (29) are provided. The cylindrical casing (11) is provided with a cone on the outside at the passage opening (3), the end edge (18) of which has a smaller diameter and lies at least approximately in the plane of the passage opening (3) of the mixing pipe (1).

Mixing device for an oil or gas burner with a mixing tube (1) with a
transmission aperture (3) on its end face, an annular baffle plate (10)

arranged upstream in the direction of flow in front of the transmission
aperture and having a cylindrical casing (11) facing towards the

transmission aperture of the mixing tube, and at least one jet (4) and at
least one starting electrod
e (29), wherein the cylindrical casing near to
the transmission aperture is provided externally with a taper, the terminal

edge of which, having the smaller diameter, is at least approximately,
preferably exactly, in the plane of the transmission aperture of the

mixing tube, characterised in that the cylindrical casing (11) projects out
of the mixing tube (1) wherein the terminal edge (18) of the taper or

inner tube (7) lies upstream in the direction of flow in front of the
terminal edge (32) of the cylindrical casing (11), and that the annular

baffle plate (10) is provided with radial slits (12).
Mixing device according to claim 1, characterised in that the cylindrical
casing (11) is provided with preferably slit-shaped openings (33).
Mixing device according to claim 2, characterised in that the slit-shaped
openings (33) run along generatrices of the cylindrical casing (11).
Mixing device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that an
outer recirculation tube (2) and an inner flame tube (17) are arranged in

the flame area in front of the mixing tube (1), wherein the flame tube
(17) is formed by a perforated sheet.
Mixing device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
mixing tube (1) is provided with a sealing flange (16) which has radial

slits (27) open on one side. 
Mixing device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
several gas jets (25, 26) are provided, at least one of which extends, in

the direction of flow, to the flame side of the baffle plate (10).
