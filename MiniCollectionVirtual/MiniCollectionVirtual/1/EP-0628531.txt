<ABSTRACT>
Process for the selective etherification of any, optionally polyoxygenated, primary or secondary mono- or polyalcohol by the use of a Williamson-type reaction by which, in a first stage, the alcohol ROH is converted, in the presence of a strong base, to the alkoxide RO
<
-
>
 and, in a second stage, the alkoxide RO
<
-
>
 is converted to an ether ROR' by nucleophilic substitution on a halogenated derivative R'X, which process is characterised in that the strong base in the solid, preferably finely divided, form, the alcohol to be etherified and the halide are reacted in a single stage at atmospheric pressure and with stirring in a slightly hydrated solvent-free medium and in the presence of a small amount of a polyether which acts as catalyst and then the ether formed is isolated in a way known per se.

Process for the selective etherification of any 
primary or secondary mono- or polyalcohol, polyoxygenated 

or not, by the implementation of a Williamson type reaction 
by which, in a first phase, the ROH alcohol is transformed 

in the presence of a strong base into an RO- alcoholate 
and, in a second phase, the RO-alcoholate is transformed 

into a ROR' ether by nucleophilic substitution on an R'X 
halogen derivative,
 
characterized in that
 
in a single step, at atmospheric pressure and while 

agitating, the strong base in solid form, preferably finely 
divided, the alcohol to be etherified and the halide are 

reacted in a slightly hydrated medium devoid of solvent and 
in the presence of a small quantity of a polyether acting 

as a catalyst, then, the ether formed is isolated in a 
manner which is known 
per
se
, it being understood that 
neither the starting ROH alcohol nor the desired ether is 

the polyether acting as a catalyst. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the polyether used as a catalyst has at least 5 consecutive 

ethoxy groups and therefore at least 6 oxygen atoms per 
molecule. 
Process according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the polyether acting as a catalyst is preferably added in 

an amount greater than or equal to 5% in relation to the 
mass of the alcohol to be etherified.  

 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterized in that
 
if the alcohol to be etherified is a hydroxylated polyether, 

it acts itself as a catalyst. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that the hydroxylated polyether to be 

etherified is a polyoxyalkylene, branched or not. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
 
characterized in that the strong base is an alkaline or 

alkaline-earth hydroxide. 
Process according to Claim 6,
 
characterized in that
 
the strong base is potassium, the latter being introduced 

in an amount approximately twice the stoichiometric amount 
when etherifying a primary alcohol, and approximately 3 

times the stoichiometric amount when etherifying a 
secondary alcohol. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
 
characterized in that
 
the halogenated derivative is a brominated derivative. 
Process according to Claim 8,
 
characterized in that
 
the etherification reaction is carried out at ambient 

temperature. 
Process according to any one of Claims 6 to 9,
 
characterized in that
 
the hydration rate of the reaction medium is selected such 

that the ratio of the number of mols of water to the number 
of mols of alkaline hydroxide is between 0.1 and 5.
