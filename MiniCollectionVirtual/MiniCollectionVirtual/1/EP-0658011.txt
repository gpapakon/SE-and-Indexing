<ABSTRACT>
An electronic equipment, such as a car audio equipment, includes a console unit 
(3) attached to an equipment body (2) and having a plurality of operation buttons 

disposed on its front surface and an attaching mechanism (14) for attaching the console 
unit (3) to the equipment body (2). The attaching mechanism (14) includes an arm (17), 

a holder (27) and first and second springs (22,34). The arm (17) is attached so as to be 
rotated in the direction corresponding to the direction in which the console unit (3) is 

attached to and detached from the equipment body (2). The arm (17) has a release 
operation member (19) provided at a part thereof. The holder (27) is rotatably attached 

to a tip end portion of the arm (17) in an opposing relation to the arm (17). The holder 
(27) includes a first engagement portion (31) which is engaged with an engagement 

portion (30) of the console unit (3) to thereby hold the console unit (3) and a second 
engagement portion (33) which is engaged with an engagement portion (32) of the 

equipment body (2). The first spring (22) applies to the console unit (3) a biasing force 
in the direction in which the console unit (3) is pushed forward. The second spring (34) 

is weaker in spring force than the first spring (22) and applies to the holder (27) a biasing 
force in the direction in which the console unit (3) is pushed forward. The attaching 

mechanism (14) is arranged such that since the first and second springs (22,34) are 
different in spring force from each other, the second engagement portion (33) of the 

holder (27) is engaged with the engagement portion (32) of the equipment body (2) to 
hold the console unit (3) in place under the condition that the console unit (3) is attached 

to the equipment body (2) and that, when the release operation member (19) of the arm 
(17) is pushed, the second engagement portion (33) of the holder (27) is disengaged from 

the engagement portion (32) of the equipment body (2) to thereby detach the console 
unit (3) from the equipment body (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic equipment and more
particularly to an electronic equipment whose console unit can be detached from
its equipment body.Recently, car audio equipment designed to be mounted on automobiles,
such as cassette players, CD (compact disc) players and tuners, are commercially
available on the market.The recent problem that such car audio equipment encounters is that the
car audio equipment is stolen while the driver is away from the automobile.To solve the above-mentioned problem, the car audio equipment is
composed of an equipment body and a console unit (operation unit) such that the
console unit, having a plurality of operation buttons for operating the electronic
equipment, can be detachably attached to the equipment body.When the driver leaves the car, the driver detaches the operation unit and
carries the same. Thus, the equipment body cannot work without the console unit.
Therefore, it is possible to prevent the equipment body from being stolen.Such car audio equipment having the detachable console unit includes an
apparatus for attaching and detaching the console unit to and from the equipment
body, such as an apparatus proposed by the present applicant (see Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No.5-149309 (JP-A-05 149309)).However, in the attaching and detaching apparatus of the car audio
equipment disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.5-149309, a
release mechanism portion for detaching the console unit from the equipment
body and a pop-up mechanism portion for projecting the console unit when the
console unit is detached are constructed separately. As a result, since the release
mechanism portion and the pop-up mechanism portion are independently
arranged, the attaching and detaching apparatus becomes complicated in 
arrangement and increased in number of assembly parts, which makes the
apparatus expensive. As the number of assembly parts is increased, the apparatus
becomes large in size on the whole. There is then the problem that the apparatus
cannot be miniaturized.An example of such an apparatus is disclosed in the European patent
application EP 0 507 990. This European patent application shows a car stereo
having a grille detachably mounted on a stereo body. Engaging recesses are
formed at the four corners of the grille. Flexible latch members are provided on
the stereo body, each of which is adapted to engage with the corresponding
engaging recess of the grille when the grille is attached to the body. A release
mechanism is provided
