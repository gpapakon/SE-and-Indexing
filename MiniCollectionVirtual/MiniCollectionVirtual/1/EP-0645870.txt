A method of transmitting information obtained from sensors of physical
parameters by:


transmitting information on a single electrically conductive transmission wire
(2),
using an electrical signal (10) to convey the information,
using an electrical or electronic circuit (1) to generate a converted electrical
signal conveying the information, and
using means for receiving and analyzing the information transmitted,
characterized in that
 the method consists of, starting from physical
parameters measured by sensors responsive to the state of operation or use

of an electrical appliance, temporally truncating, by means of the electrical or
electronic circuit (1), the electrical signal for a given time corresponding to the

turn-off time of limiter means having a turn-off threshold voltage for marking
said electrical signal with information from a sensor.
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 it consists of using a
sinusoidal alternating current signal from the mains supply to convey the

information automatically and the truncation can be applied to the positive
half-wave or the negative half-wave of said signal.
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 it consists of
distinguishing each kind of information transmitted by the time for which the

half-wave is turned off.
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 it consists of using the
positive half-wave (11) of the sinusoidal alternating current signal from the

mains supply to convey the information.
An electronic or electrical transmission circuit (1) adapted to be connected
to a single electrically conductive information transmission wire (2), an

electrical power supply (4) supplying an electrical signal (10) that can be
converted by the electronic or electrical circuit (1) to convey information from

sensors of physical parameters, and means for receiving and analyzing
information transmitted by the transmission wire (2), 
characterized in that
 the
electronic circuit (1) includes means for temporally truncating the electrical

signal for a given time corresponding to the turn-off time of limiter means 
having a turn-off threshold voltage, to mark said electrical signal with

information from a sensor responsive to the operation or use of an electrical
appliance.
A circuit according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 each kind of information
transmitted by a sensor corresponds to turning off the electrical signal for a

particular time period.
A circuit according to claim 5 or claim 6, 
characterized in that
 it is supplied
with power by the electrical power supply (4) from the mains supply.
A circuit according to any of claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that
 it includes a
switch (S1, S2) controlled by a binary sensor of physical parameters

associated with a Zener diode (D1, D2) shunting said switch (S1, S2) to
truncate the electrical signal (10) temporally with the opening of said switch

(S1, S2).
A system including a circuit according to any of claims 5 to 8, 
characterized
in that
 it is electrically connected by a transmission wire (2) to means for
receiving and analyzing transmitted information so as to optimize the

operation of the electrical appliance, said receiver and analyzer means
consisting of a voltage divider (3) to which is transmitted the electrical signal

marked by information from the sensors.
A circuit according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 it includes means for
temporally truncating the electrical signal having a cut-off voltage that varies

linearly as a function of variation of physical parameters read by a sensor.
A domestic electrical appliance including an electronic or electrical circuit
(1) according to any of claims 5 to 10.
A domestic electrical appliance according to claim 11, 
characterized in
that
 it is a clothes iron.
A domestic electrical appliance according to claim 11, 
characterized in
that
 it is a steam generator connected to a clothes iron by an information
transmission wire (2).
