<ABSTRACT>
A steel containing predetermined components is 
rolled in a recrystallization temperature region or a 

non-recrystallization temperature region of an austenite 
and is subsequently subjected to repeated hot bending. 

Alternatively, a surface layer portion is cooled during 
rolling of the steel described above to an α single phase 

or a γ/α dual phase temperature region, rolling is then 
effected and is finished at the point of time when the 

surface temperature of the plate rises above an Ac
3
 point 
due to recuperative heat, and repeated bending is carried 

out. Still alternatively, the steel described above is 
rolled to a cumulative reduction ratio of at least 20% in 

the non-recrystallization temperature region and is then 
subjected to repeated bending. Further alternatively, 

the surface layer portion is cooled during hot rolling of 
the steel described above to an α single or 

γ/α dual phase temperature region, rolling is then 
continued at a cumulative reduction ratio of at least 20% 

and is finished at the point when the surface temperature 
of the steel plate rises less than (Ac
3
 point - 200°C) 
due to recuperative heat, and subsequently, repeated 

bending is carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention provides a thick steel 
plate having excellent strength and toughness and 
furthermore a thick steel plate devoid of material 
anisotropy and having excellent brittle crack propagation 
stop characteristics. Properties of a thick steel plate used as 
structural members or for other purposes are determined 
by its chemical components and heat treatment. Recently, 
production of a thick steel plate having excellent 
strength and toughness has become possible by a 
controlled rolling method predominantly comprising 
rolling at a low temperature and by an accelerated 
cooling method which conducts cooling in succession to 
rolling. Such production techniques are described in 
Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku) 
Nos. 49-7291, 57-21007, and 59-14535. In controlled rolling in general, austenite 
grains are made fine in a high temperature region by 
recrystallization and further drawn sufficiently under 
the non-crystallized state in a low temperature region to 
obtain fine ferrite by transformation in a subsequent 
accelerated cooling process. However, when such rolling in the 
recrystallization temperature region and rolling in the 
non-recrystallization temperature region are combined, 
the problem remains that a long waiting period is 
necessary for the drop of the rolling temperature and 
thus the productivity is remarkably impeded. Another 
problem resides in that the effect of rolling is lost 
during the period from the end of rolling in the non-recrystallization 
temperature region to the start of  
 
accelerated cooling (mainly because of the decrease of 
the dislocation density introduced by rolling), and the 
effect of rolling in the non-recrystallization 
temperature region cannot be exploited fully. Still another problem resides in that when 
rolling is finished in the non-recrystallization 
temperature region, the rolled aggregate texture is 
transferred as such to the texture after rolling and 
material anisotropy increases. When rolling is carried 
out in the recrystallization temperature region in order 
to prevent this material anisotropy, there occurs the 
problem that since the rolling temperature is high, the 
grain growth after recrystallization is so fast that the 
crystal grains become coarse. When rolling is finished 
in a temperature region as low as possible within the 
range in which recrystallization can take place, however, 
partial recrystallization is likely to occur and duplex 
grains develop and cause deterioration of the material. 
Accordingly,
