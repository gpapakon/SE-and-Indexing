<ABSTRACT>
A ballast device for a compact fluorescent lamp, 
comprises a ballast case including upper case 10-1, a lower 

case, and PCBs. The upper case has a incandescent lamp base 19 
and the lower case has a socket substrate 11 having a compact 

fluorescent lamp socket. A bottom portion of the upper case 
is assembled with said lower case having a socket substrate 11. 

The PCBs includes a first PCB 15 where electronic circuit 
components 15-2 are mounted on, having a first receiving 

portion for allowing for the fluorescent lamp socket to be 
inserted in, and a second PCB 16 where a electronic circuit 

components 16-2 are mounted, and the mounted components 16-2 
having long height are located in center area of the second 

PCB 16 to be located inside the bulb base 19.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a compact fluorescent lamp 
apparatus having a ballast, a socket for the compact 
fluorescent lamp, and an incandescent lamp base fitting to 
a conventional incandescent lamp socket. A florescent lamp (FL) has a high efficiency in emitting 
light. Thus, in order to use the FL lamp in stead of a 
incandescent lamp, a size of the FL lamp is made to be small. 
Trying to insert a small fluorescent lamp or the like into a 
bulb socket of the incandescent lamp results in further 
reduction of the lamp apparatus size including an electronic 
ballast. Fig. 1 shows a conventional compact fluorescent lamp 
apparatus having a ballast case 22 without a compact 
fluorescent lamp socket, a small fluorescent lamp 23 and 
a bulb base 21, which are integrated in one unit. Although the lamp apparatus provides a convenience for its 
use, both of the socket and ballast are to be replaced with a 
new one when a life of a fluorescent lamp is ended. Therefore 
it causes to waste material sources. A compact fluorescent lamp shown in Fig. 2 has been 
commercially available. The compact fluorescent lamp has a plug 
28 that can be fitted to a socket in a socket-type ballast, and  
 
four pins 29 for electric connection. In order to use such compact fluorescent lamp, many types 
of ballast are produced. There are a type of electronic ballast 
that has a socket for accommodation of the compact fluorescent 
lamp plug, and has an incandescent bulb base for fitting to 
incandescent bulb socked. However, it is continuous need to reduce a size of the 
conventional electronic ballast having a compact fluorescent 
lamp socket and a bulb base. It is an object of the invention to provide a ballast 
device for a compact fluorescent lamp which is able to 
maintain the compatibility with the conventional products 
with respect to the socket size for both of the bulb base and 
compact fluorescent lamp plug, and particularly to reduce the 
size of the ballast case. The ballast device of the present invention includes a 
ballast case including upper case, a lower case, and a first 
and second printed circuit board(PCB). The upper case has a conventional incandescent lamp base 
(bulb base) at its top portion, the lower case has a compact 
fluorescent lamp socket substrate. A bottom portion of the 
upper case is adapted to be assembled with the lower case. The first PCB has electronic ballast circuit components 
mounted thereon, and has a first receiving portion for a 
fluorescent lamp socket formed in the lower case to be
