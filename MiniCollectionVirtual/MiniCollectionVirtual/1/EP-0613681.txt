<ABSTRACT>
A nail lacquer containing a film forming resin, a 
plasticizer and a solvent, characterized in that the film 

forming resin is a blend of: (i) a graft copolymer having a 
main backbone chain of acrylic ester units and methacrylic 

ester units, with the main backbone chain having grafted 
thereto pendant trialkoxysilyl groups and pendant ethylene 

glycol dimethacrylate groups; and (ii) a silsesquioxane resin 
containing RSiO
3/2
 units and ≡SiOH units in which R is an 
alkyl group or an aryl group. In another embodiment, the 

film forming resin is not a blend, but is a graft copolymer 
containing, in addition to pendant trialkoxysilyl groups, 

pendant vinylbenzyl chloride groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a primary film forming 
resin for nail lacquers and nail enamel formulations wherein 
a grafted polymeric film forming resin is used as a 
replacement for nitrocellulose. Nail lacquers and enamels typically contain 
several ingredients among which are a primary film former, 
secondary film formers, plasticizers, solvents, colorants 
and fillers. In the past, nitrocellulose has been the 
primary film former employed in the majority of nail polish 
formulations but it suffers from the disadvantages that it 
is explosive; it tends to discolor as a function of time 
rendering it aesthetically displeasing; and it is prone to 
undergo sharp changes in viscosity which make application 
difficult. Thus a need exists in the nail lacquer arts for 
an improved primary film forming material. Unlike copolymers having a linear arrangement of 
sequences such as -AAABBB- and -ABABAB-, graft copolymers 
are polymers in which the molecules are characterized by a 
main backbone chain to which side chains containing 
different atomic constituents are attached at various points 
along the main chain. For example, a graft copolymer can be 
represented by the structure 
 
The monomer units 
A and B are referred to as the main chain or backbone, the 
sequence of C units is the side chain or graft and X is the 
unit in the backbone to which the graft is attached.  
 Nail lacquers containing graft copolymers are not 
new. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,153,268 describes a 
nail lacquer formulation containing as the film forming 
resin a graft copolymer having a main backbone chain of 
acrylic ester monomer units and methacrylic ester monomer 
units. Grafted to the main backbone chain are side chain 
units of carboxyl groups and side chain units of 
trialkoxysilyl groups. In the present invention, ethylene glycol 
dimethacrylate side chain units are grafted to the main 
backbone chain instead of carboxyl groups and the resulting 
graft copolymer is cold blended with a silsesquioxane resin. 
The blended material is useful as a film forming resin in 
nail lacquer applications. It possesses good chip 
resistance, wearability, hardness and gloss. The graft 
copolymer provides improved adhesion and the silsesquioxane 
resin provides improved hardness for the nail lacquer 
system. The invention provides a graft copolymer which has 
a main backbone chain of acrylic ester monomer units and 
methacrylic ester monomer units. The main backbone chain 
has grafted thereto side chain units of ethylene glycol 
dimethacr
