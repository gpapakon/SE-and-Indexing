<ABSTRACT>
According to the prior art, for reasons of adjustability the central beam gun in in-line electron-beam-producing systems produces the electron beam for the colour green. For the vertical deflection of the electron beams, this has the effect that the horizontal bars of the three primary colours on the monitor (screen) have a different strip width (stripe width) in the y direction. For homogenizing the strip width in the y direction, according to the invention it is specified that the central beam gun (26) is that electron beam gun which, in comparison with all electron beam guns of the in-line beam-producing system (14), emits the highest beam power.
