<ABSTRACT>
The acceleration applied to a selected device such as a magnetic 
disc drive system can be detected by the use of an acceleration detector 

having at least one piezoelectric acceleration sensor unit. The sensor 
unit includes a piezoelectric element, a supporting member for the 

piezoelectric element and two electrical leads. The piezoelectric element 
is formed with a pair of elongate sheets made of a piezoelectric ceramic 

and an intermediate insulation layer interposed between the elongate 
sheets to generate a voltage difference instantaneously therebetween in 

response to the acceleration of the acceleration detector. The support 
member is made of an electrically insulating resin, and has a concave 

which is formed with side and bottom walls and a top opening. The side 
wall is provided with a slit in which the piezoelectric element is tightly 

caught in such a manner as to divide the concave into two open-chambers 
and be supported by the support member in a cantilever 

fashion. The electrical leads extend into the concave to make electrical 
connections between the elongate sheets and the electrical leads. In the 

present invention, since the piezoelectric element can be attached 
accurately at a predetermined direction to the supporting member by 

forcing it into the slit, it is possible to stably supply the acceleration 
detector having excellent sensitivity to the acceleration without causing 

variations in detecting direction of the acceleration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an acceleration detector using a
piezoelectric element, which is adapted to be mounted to a selected
device and capable of generating an electrical output signal when it is
subjected to vibrations or shock.Magnetic disc drive systems have been widely used as an external
memory device of a computer. When a magnetic disc drive system is
subjected to vibrations or shock, it is necessary to detect the acceleration
of the disc drive system and to protect the magnetic disc rotated at high
speed by stopping the operations of read/write heads in response to the
detected acceleration. U.S. Pat. No. 5,235,472 proposes a shock sensor
1K mounted on a computer disc drive. As shown in FIG. 17, the shock
sensor 1K is provided with a subassembly 10K comprised of piezoelectric
polymer film 11K disposed between top metallized layers 12K and lower
metallized layer 13K, and an electrically shielded case 40K for
incorporating the subassembly 10K therein. The shielded case 40K is
formed with a base 41K having a supporting member 20K for supporting
the subassembly 10K and receiving first and second electrical leads 30K
and 31K, a rectangular-shaped frame 42K providing structural integrity
of the shock sensor 1K, and a metallic cover 43K providing side and top
electrical shielding. The subassembly 10K is mounted to the supporting
member 20K such that the top metallized layers 12K are connected to
the first electrical leads 30K, and the lower metallized layer is connected 
to the second electrical lead 31K. The top and lower metallized layers
(12K and 13K) are connected to amplification and comparator circuitry
(not shown) through the first and second electrical leads (30K and 31K).
The amplification and comparator circuitry issues a write fault signal
upon detection of external force in excess of a predetermined threshold.
This prior art also describes that the shock sensor 1K may be mounted
on the computer disk drive in such a manner as to be a 45 degree(s)
angle to each of the x, y and z axes of an orthogonal coordinate system so
that linear and torsional forces imposed thereto may be monitored.For operating the shock sensor 1K stably for an extended time, it
is necessary to securely attach the subassembly 10K to the supporting
member 20K of the base 41K. However, since the shock sensor 1K of
this prior art uses the piezoelectric polymer film 11K with relatively low
thermal resistance, there is a problem of causing a breakage of the
polymer film 11K when fixing the subassembly 10K to the
