<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pump system and 
a method for operation thereof and, more particularly, to 
a pump system which is installed, for example, in a flow 
control tank of small-sized combined septic tank equipment. Standardization of small-sized combined septic 
tanks has heretofore been promoted for the purpose of 
preventing water pollution of rivers, lakes and marshes. 
Fig. 8 schematically shows small-sized combined septic 
tank equipment in which a conventional pump is installed. 
As illustrated in the figure, sewage flowing into a flow 
control tank 2 from a raw sewage tank 1 is supplied to an 
anaerobic tank 4 by a pump 3, and the sewage is purified in 
the anaerobic tank 4 and an aerobic contact aeration tank 5 
and is then discharged. As the pump 3 employed for the above-described 
purpose, a rubber vane submersible pump or a small-output, 
general-purpose submersible sanitary sewage pump or non-clogging 
sewage pump has heretofore been used. The above-described rubber vane submersible pump is 
a positive-displacement pump, which rotates at relatively 
low speed. Therefore, it has the advantageous feature that 
a low flow rate can readily be obtained and an approximately 
constant pump discharge can be obtained independently of 
the pump head. Accordingly, it is possible to construct 
small-sized combined septic tank equipment without providing 
a flow control device 6 for controlling the flow rate of 
sewage supplied from the flow control tank 2 to the 
anaerobic tank 4 by the pump 3. However, in order to reduce the wear of the rubber 
vane of the rubber vane submersible pump and to thereby 
ensure a predetermined lifetime, it is necessary to use 
a special motor having a multipolar structure, such as  
 
a 12-pole motor. Thus, the conventional system suffers 
from the problem that the product cost of the pump is 
disadvantageously high. In addition, it is impossible 
to avoid an increase in power consumption due to friction 
occurring in the rubber vane part, and it is also difficult 
to overcome internal friction. Accordingly, the conventional 
system including a rubber vane submersible pump gives 
rise to the problem that electric power consumption is high 
and a long operation lifetime cannot be expected. Further, 
since this type of pump generates a high-pitched noise, the 
small-sized combined septic tank equipment, which is likely 
to be installed near a residential area, may cause a noise 
problem. On the other hand, when a submersible sanitary 
sewage pump is used, the
