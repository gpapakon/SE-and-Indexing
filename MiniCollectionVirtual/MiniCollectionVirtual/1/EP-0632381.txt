<ABSTRACT>
A computer system comprises a number of replicated units. At 
least two of the units include monitoring components for 

monitoring the status of the system. The monitoring 
components communicate with each other to exchange status 

information, so as to enable both of the monitoring 
components to form a combined view of the status of the 

system, based on information gathered by both of the 
monitoring components. This enables each monitoring 

component to locate faults more precisely, and thus enables 
more appropriate recovery action to be taken.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fault-tolerant computer systems.It is well known that fault tolerance can be achieved in a
computer system by replicating components of the system. For
example, two processing units may be provided, one of which acts
as the active unit and the other of which acts as a stand-by.
When a fault is detected in the active unit, from which it
cannot recover, the stand-by is switched in as the active unit,
allowing system operation to continue.FR-A-2 561 410 describes a such a system, comprising two
processing units. Each processing unit includes an image
memory, which stores the values of the inputs and outputs of
that unit during each program cycle. The two units exchange
these values, by way of a serial connection, and each compares
the values stored locally with those obtained from the other
processing unit. If there is a mismatch, a fault procedure is
activated, which attempts to determine the nature of the fault.A problem which arises in such a system is how to locate faults
precisely, to enable an appropriate recovery action to be taken.
In particular, in the above-referenced French patent, the fact
that a mismatch is detected merely indicates that a fault is
present somewhere in the system; it does not indicate where that
fault is located.The present invention provides a computer system as claimed in
Claim 1 below.It can be seen that in the present invention, rather than merely
exchanging input and output values, the two processing units
exchange status reports relating to the various system units. For example, a status report might indicate that a data storage
unit has disappeared as viewed by one monitoring means, or else
might indicate that the data storage unit is operating normally.
From these status reports, it is possible for each processor to
deduce a combined view of the status of each system unit, from
which it is possible to locate faults more precisely than would
be possible merely on the basis of comparing input and output
values.Figure 1 is an overall block diagram of a fault-tolerant
computer system embodying the invention.Figure 2 is a block diagram of a high availability manager (HAM)
component of the system.Figure 3 is a flow chart showing the operarion of the HAM.One computer system in accordance with the invention will now be
described by way of example with reference to the accompanying
drawings.Referring to Figure 1, the system comprises two processing units
10 and 11. Each of these processing units may comprise, for
example, an ICL DRS 6000 processor,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A computer system comprising:

(a) first and second processing units (10, 11); and
(b) a plurality of further system units (12, 13), connected to
both said first and second processing units;
(c) each of the processing units (10,11) including a monitoring
means (20);
(d) the processing units (10, 11) being inter-connected by way
of a data connection (14);
characterised in that
:
(e) each of the monitoring means (20) performs checks on its
local processing unit (10 or 11) and on the further system units

(12, 13) connected to that unit, and generates status reports
indicating the status of those units as viewed by that

monitoring means;
(f) the monitoring means (20) exchange their status reports, by
way of said connection (14); and
(g) each of the monitoring means (20) deduces from the status
reports generated locally, and from those received from the

other monitoring means, a combined view of the status of the
units.
A system according to Claim 1 wherein each of said
monitoring means (20) includes a status table (24) for holding a

plurality of status reports, including both the locally
generated status reports and those received from the other

monitoring means (20).
A system according to Claim 2 wherein each of said
monitoring means (20) includes means for searching its status

table (24) for a predetermined combination of status reports,
and for initiating a predetermined action upon detection of that

combination. 
A system according to Claim 3 wherein said predetermined
action is initiated only if the status reports in said

predetermined combination have been valid for at least a
predetermined period of time.
