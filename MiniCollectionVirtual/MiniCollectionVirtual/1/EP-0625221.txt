<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an elastic 
nonwoven fabric comprised of a web of bonded 
thermoplastic spunbonded filaments of a thermoplastic 
elastomer and to absorbent products, such as disposable 
diapers, adult incontinence pads and sanitary napkins, 
and to a coverstock for absorbent personal care 
products. The manufacture of nonwoven webs has become a 
substantial part of the textile industry. There are a 
wide variety of uses for nonwoven webs, including the 
manufacture of surgical drapes, wiping cloths, carpets 
and components of disposable products such as diapers 
and sanitary napkins. It is often desirable to incorporate an 
elastomeric web into a nonwoven fabric, particularly 
for nonwoven fabrics used in disposable garment and 
personal care products. Stretchable fabrics are 
desirable for use as components in these products 
because of their ability to conform to irregular shapes  
 
and to allow more freedom of body movements than do 
fabrics with limited extensibility. There are a wide variety of techniques for 
producing nonwoven webs. Elastic nonwoven webs have 
been produced, for example, by meltblowing techniques. 
In meltblowing, thermoplastic resin is fed into an 
extruder where it is melted and heated to the 
appropriate temperature required for fiber formation. 
The extruder feeds the molten resin to a special melt-blowing 
die. The die arrangement is generally a 
plurality of linearally arranged small diameter 
capillaries. The resin emerges from the die orifices 
as molten threads into a high velocity stream of gas, 
usually air. The air attenuates the polymer into a 
blast of fine fibers which are collected on a moving 
screen placed in front of the blast. As the fibers 
land on the screen, they entangle to form a cohesive 
web. Meltblowing forms very small diameter fibers, 
typically about two micrometers in diameter and several 
inches in length, which entangle in the web 
sufficiently so that it is generally impossible to 
remove one complete fiber from the mass of fibers or to 
trace one fiber from beginning to end. Elastic meltblown webs exhibit a number of 
desirable properties. For example, the webs have good 
integrity due primarily to the fiber entanglement and 
surface attraction between the very small fibers. 
There are, in addition, advantages inherent in the 
meltblowing process itself. For example, the fibers 
are collected at a relatively short distance from the 
die, usually ranging from 30 cm (12 inches) to 15 cm (6 
inches), giving a positive control of
