<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a current transformer designed for installation in a metal enclosure (1) at earth potential surrounding a high-tension conductor (2). The transformer includes at least one annular core (5), a secondary winding wound on the core (5) and at least one earthed protective winding (6). To provide protection against overvoltages, the outside surface (5a) of the core (5) is surrounded by a hollow, cylindrical, electrically conducting screen (8) which forms a reference earth for the substantially radial earth connection (7) for the protective winding (6).

Current transformer for installation in a metal 
enclosure (1) at earth potential surrounding a high-voltage 

conductor (2), having at least one annular 
core (5), a secondary winding applied to the annular 

core (5) and at least one earthed protective winding (6), 
characterized in that the annular core (5) is surrounded 

coaxially on the outside (5a) by a hollow cylindrical, 
electrically conducting screen (8), which is arranged 

inside the metal enclosure (1) and forms a reference 
earth for the essentially radial earth connection (7) of 

the protective winding (6). 
Current transformer according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the protective winding (6) has a plurality 

of radial earth connections (7) which are arranged 
uniformly distributed over the outer periphery of the 

annular core (5) and which are each contacted individually 
by the scree
n (8). 
Current transformer according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the screen (8) is formed by a 

cylindrically shaped sheet-metal or film element. 
Current transformer according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the screen (8) is formed by a 

cage (18a) having rods (18) extending parallel to surface 
lines. 
Current transformer according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the screen (8) is formed from 

cylinder segments (17) which are arranged with 
interspaces parallel to surface lines distributed uniformly 

over the periphery around the annular core (5).  
 
Current transformer according to one of Claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the screen (8) is electrically 

conductively connected to the enclosure (1) at the 
ends of the cylinder on both sides (10).
