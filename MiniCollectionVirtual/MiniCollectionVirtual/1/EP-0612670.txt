<ABSTRACT>
A product sleeve for holding (typically) four products, 
such as bottles, has a protuberance between pairs of products to 

assist in holding the products in position within the sleeve. 
The protuberances are formed by tabs (77a,b) hinged to one end panel 

(68) of 
the product sleeve blank. These tabs (77a,b) have a notch (78a,b) and 

at least 
one further hinge line (76a,b). These tabs (77a,b) may be pushed through 

openings (84a,b) in the other end panel (60) of the blank so that they 
fold 

about their hinge lines (74a,b,76a,b) to form the noted protuberances 
and the 

notch (78a,b) in the tabs (77a,b) lock to a portion of the other end 
panel (60).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a paperboard product sleeve 
blank and a product sleeve. A common form of packaging for pudding cups, yoghurt 
cups, bottles, and the like is a sleeve for holding a number of 
the products. Typically such a sleeve holds four products. 
Because the sleeves are open at either end a problem in the field 
has been that of products falling out of the sleeves. This invention seeks to provide a product sleeve which 
more securely holds products within the sleeve. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a pagerboard product sleeve blank having opposite sides and a 
first and second end and comprising: a plurality of panels joined 
end-to-end at transverse hinge lines, a tab joined at a hinge 
line to the panel of said plurality of panels which is at said 
first end, said first end panel tab having at least one further 
hinge line making an angle with said hinge line such that said 
first end panel tab may be folded about said hinge line and said 
at least one further hinge line into a protuberance, said first  
 
end panel tab also having a notch, and an opening through the 
panel of said plurality of panels at said second end sized to 
receive said first end panel tab when said first end panel tab 
is folded into said protuberance, said notch of said first end 
panel tab for engaging with a portion of said second end panel 
in order to lock said first end panel tab within said opening and 
to lock said first end panel tab in its folded state as said 
protuberance, whereby said first end panel tab, when locked 
within said opening in a folded state as a protuberance, holds 
said plurality of panels in a sleeve configuration and is for 
abutting the base of products within the sleeve to assist in 
maintaining the products in position. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, 
there is provided a paperboard product sleeve comprising: a 
plurality of panels joined end-to-end at transverse hinge lines 
terminating at a first and second bottom panel, an opening 
through said second bottom panel, a tab folded at a hinge line 
joining said tab to said first bottom panel and folded at at 
least one further hinge line which makes an angle with said hinge 
line into a protuberance, said folded tab protuberance having a 
notch, said folded tab protuberance received through said opening 
with said notch engaging with a portion of said second bottom 
panel to lock said folded tab protuberance within said opening 
in its folded state, whereby said folded tab protuberance

A paperboard product sleeve blank having opposite sides and 
a first and second end and comprising: 


a plurality of panels joined end-to-end at transverse hinge 
lines, 
a tab joined at a hinge line to the panel of said plurality of 
panels which is at said first end, said first end panel tab 

having at least one further hinge line making an angle with said 
hinge line such that said first end panel tab may be folded about 

said hinge line and said at least one further hinge line into a 
protuberance, said first end panel tab also having a notch, and 
an opening through the panel of said plurality of panels at 
said second end sized to receive said first end panel tab when 

said first end panel tab is folded into said protuberance, 
said notch of said first end panel tab for engaging with a 
portion of said second end panel in order to lock said first end 

panel tab within said opening and to lock said first end panel 
tab in its folded state as said protuberance, 
 
whereby said first end panel tab, when locked within said opening 

in a folded state a protuberance, holds said plurality of 
panels in a sleeve configuration and is for abutting the base of 

products within the sleeve to assist in maintaining the products 
in position. 
The product sleeve blank of claim 1 wherein said portion of 
said second end panel comprises a tab within said opening of said 

second end panel joined to said second end panel at a hinge line, 
 

said second end panel tab having a notch positioned so that when 
said first end panel tab is folded into said protuberance and 

received within said opening said second end panel tab may be 
hinged so that said notch of said second end panel tab engages 

with said notch of said first end panel tab. 
The product sleeve blank of claim 2 wherein said first end 
panel tab, when folded into said protuberance, has a generally 

V-shaped profile. 
The product sleeve blank of claim 3 wherein said hinge line 
and said further hinge line of said first end panel tab are 

positioned so that when said first end panel tab is folded into 
said protuberance, said generally V-shaped profile is directed 

toward a side of said plurality of panels and wherein said hinge 
line joining said second end panel tab to said second end panel 

is directed generally longitudinally of said plurality of panels. 
The product sleeve blank of claim 4 wherein said first end 
panel tab comprises a first triangular portion between said hinge 

line and said further hinge and a second triangular portion 
extending from said further hinge line. 
The product sleeve blank of claim 2 wherein said first end 
panel has tongue and said second end panel has a ledge 

positioned so that when said tongue is overlapped with said 
ledge, said first end panel tab is registered with said opening. 
The product sleeve blank of claim 1 wherein said opening has 
an edge, said edge 
comprising said portion of said second end 
panel and said first end panel tab has a further notch, said 

notch and said further notch for engaging with said edge of said 
opening. 
The product sleeve blank of claim 7 wherein said first end 
panel tab has a triangular base portion bounded by said hinge 

line, said further hinge line and a still further hinge line, a 
first wing extending from said further hinge line and having said 

notch, a second wing extending from said still further hinge line 
and having said further notch. 
A paperboard product sleeve comprising: 

a plurality of panels joined end-to-end at transverse hinge 
lines terminating at a first and second bottom panel, 
an opening through said second bottom panel, 
a tab folded at a hinge line joining said tab to said first 
bottom panel and folded at at least one further hinge line which 

makes an angle with said hinge line into a protuberance, said 
folded tab protuberance having a notch, said folded tab 

protuberance received through said opening with said notch 
engaging with a portion of said second bottom panel to lock said 

folded tab protuberance within said opening in its folded state, 
whereby said folded tab protuberance holds said plurality of 

panels in a sleeve configuration and abuts the base of products 
within the sleeve to assist in maintaining the products in 

position.
