<ABSTRACT>
Light from a light source (12) is incident to a 
transmission type liquid crystal display panel 11 and the 

light transmitted therethrough is incident to two 
reflecting surfaces (14a and 14b) of a polygon mirror (14). 

A shield plate (16) is interposed between a line dividing 
the display surface of the liquid crystal display panel 

(11) into equal right and left surfaces areas and the 
marginal edge of the polygon mirror (14) along which its 

reflecting surfaces (14a and 14b) adjoin. Light 
transmitted through the right-hand surface area of the 

liquid crystal display panel and light transmitted 
through its left-hand surface area are reflected by the 

reflecting surfaces (14a and 14b), respectively, and are 
further reflected forward by reflecting mirrors (21a and 

21b) for projection onto screens (17a and 17b) by projection 
lenses (22a and 22b).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display device 
for use with video games, for instance, and, more 
particularly, to a display device with which it is 
possible to provide different or identical and changeable 
displays at a plurality of places on one panel. In some type of video game, display units are 
provided at a plurality of places on the game panel to 
display figures, symbols, letters and the like and the 
provision is made for changing the displays on some or 
all of the display units as the game proceeds. A conventional display device of this kind 
usually has liquid crystal or CRT display units provided 
on the game panel at places where it is desired to 
provide displays, and hence the display device is 
relatively expensive; in particular, the use of color 
liquid crystal display units with relatively large 
display screens appreciably raises the cost of the 
display device. There has also been proposed a 
projection liquid crystal display device of the type that 
provides a large display by projecting a display image of 
a small color liquid crystal display unit onto a 
projection screen as a magnified image. This projection 
liquid crystal display device is relatively low-cost, but 
the provision of such projection liquid crystal display 
devices at a plurality of places as in the case of the 
video game will incur great expense and consume much 
space as well. It is therefore an object of the present 
invention to provide a projection liquid crystal display 
device which is capable of providing displays at a  
 
plurality of places but is low-cost and relatively small 
in a size. In the distributed projection type liquid crystal 
display device according to the present invention, a 
transmission type liquid crystal display panel for 
displaying an image is irradiated with light from a light 
source, the light having passed through the liquid 
crystal display panel is incident on a polygon mirror and 
is reflected by its respective reflecting surfaces in 
different directions and the reflected rays of light are 
projected by projection lens means onto individual 
screens provided at different places. According to one aspect of the present invention, 
the optical paths or spaces between the respective 
reflecting surfaces of the polygon mirror and respective 
surface areas of the liquid crystal display panel are 
optically isolated by a shield plate and a projection 
lens is disposed as projection lens means at a stage 
subsequent to the polygon mirror for each projection 
screen. With

<CLAIMS>
A distributed projection type liquid crystal 
display device comprising: 

   a transmission type liquid crystal display panel 
for displaying an image; 

   a light source which irradiates said transmission 
type liquid crystal display panel with light; 

   a polygon mirror whereby light transmitted 
through said transmission type liquid crystal display 

panel and incident thereto is reflected to different 
directions; and 

   projection lens means whereby rays of light 
reflected by said polygon mirror to said different 

directions are each provided onto a screen provided at a 
different place. 
The device of claim 1, which further 
comprises a shield plate interposed between said liquid 

crystal display panel and said polygon mirror to 
optically isolate optical paths or spaces between 

respective reflecting surfaces of said polygon mirror and 
respective display areas of said liquid crystal display 

panel corresponding to said reflecting surfaces and in 
which a projection lens is disposed as said projection 

lens means at a stage subsequent to said polygon mirror 
for each screen. 
The device of claim 2, wherein optically 
isolating means, each composed of another shield plate 

and another polygon mirror for optically isolating 
optical paths or spaces and for emitting light to 

different directions, are provided in cascade in the 
optical paths of rays of light reflected by said polygon mirror. 
The device of claim 1, wherein the optical 
path lengths from the respective reflecting surfaces of 

said polygon mirror to said screens corresponding thereto 
are equal and said projection lens means is a projection 

lens provided at a stage preceding said polygon mirror. 
The device of claim 4, wherein another 
polygon mirror is provided in the optical path of each of 

rays of light reflected by said polygon mirror to reflect 
said each rays of light by respective reflecting surfaces 

of said another polygon mirror to different directions. 
The device of claim 1, wherein a shield plate 
is interposed between said liquid crystal display panel 

and said polygon mirror to optically isolate the optical 
path therebetween for each reflecting surface of said 

polygon mirror, projection lenses are each disposed as 
said projection lens means in the path of one of rays of 

light reflected by said polygon mirror and other polygon 
mirrors are each disposed at the stage subsequent to one 

of said projection lens, whereby said rays of light 
reflected by said polygon mirror are reflected by said 

other polygon mirrors to different directions for 
projection onto said individual screens. 
The device of claim 1, wherein a shield plate 
is interposed between said liquid crystal display panel
