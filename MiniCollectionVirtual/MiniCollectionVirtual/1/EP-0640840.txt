<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic field sensing
method and apparatus, and in particular, relates to a magnetic
field sensing method and apparatus for sensing an external
magnetic field which is employed in a magnetic recording
apparatus, a magnescale and encoder, and the like.Magnetic sensors which sense external magnetic fields are
employed, for example, in magnetic recording apparatuses as
magnetic heads which record and reproduce a signal in accordance
with data in a magnetic recording medium, are employed in
magnescales as displacement sensors which sense the displacement
of an object to be sensed, and are employed in encoders as
angular sensors for sensing the turning angle of motors or the
like. In this specification, sensors which sense an external
magnetic field are termed "magnetic sensors", and in addition,
devices which possess the function of recording a signal in
accordance with data on a magnetic recording medium are also
termed "magnetic sensors".One type of conventional magnetic sensor is an inductive-type
magnetic head, in which a coil is wound around a magnetic
core. Fig. 24A is a front view of a conventional ring-type
inductive magnetic head which is produced using thin films, and
Fig. 24B is a cross sectional view taken along the line A-A' in
Fig. 24A (see Masaaki Nishikawa, Magnetic Recording Theory, 
published by Asakura Shoten, 1985). In Figs. 24A and 24B, the
ring-type inductive magnetic head comprises a coil 1, magnetic
cores 2a and 2b, a magnetic core coupler 2c, a non-magnetic
insulator 3, and electrodes 4a and 4b. A gap 5 is formed
between magnetic cores 2a and 2b.By means of recording processes and reproducing processes
which will be described hereinbelow, this ring-type inductive
magnetic head records and reproduces a signal on magnetic
recording medium 6 in accordance with data. First, in the
recording process, a current corresponding to the data which are
to be recorded is caused to flow in coil 1, and magnetic cores
2a and 2b are magnetized, and thereby, magnetic recording medium
6 is magnetized as a result of the leakage magnetic field from
gap 5, and a signal is recorded. In the reproducing process, as
a result of the medium magnetic field generated by magnetic
recording medium 6, magnetic cores 2a and 2b are magnetized, and
thereby, the signal is reproduced as a result of an induced
electromotive force induced in coil 1.Recently, in the research field of magnetic recording, in
concert with demands for the miniaturization and increase in
capacity of magnetic
