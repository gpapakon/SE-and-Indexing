<ABSTRACT>
A polymer scale deposition preventive agent for use in 
polymerization of a monomer having an ethylenically 

unsaturated double bond, comprising an alkaline solution 
containing a condensation product of (A) a diphenyl 

compound having at least two amino groups and (B) a 
quinone compound. When the aforementioned monomer is 

polymerized in a polymerization vessel having a coating 
formed by applying the aforementioned preventive agent to 

inner wall surfaces followed by drying, polymer scale can 
be effectively prevented from being deposited not only on 

the areas located in the liquid-phase region but also on 
the areas around the interface between the gas and liquid 

phases in the polymerization vessel. When an obtained 
polymer is formed into a sheet or the like, it is possible 

to obtain a formed product having few fish eyes and good 
initial coloration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer scale 
deposition preventive agent for use in polymerization of a 
monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond, 
and a process for producing a polymer using the same. Heretofore, as methods for polymerization of a 
monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond 
have been known suspension, emulsion, solution, gas phase 
and bulk polymerization processes and the like. In any of 
these polymerization processes, polymer scale is liable to 
be deposited on the areas with which the monomer comes 
into contact, such as inner walls, stirring equipment and 
so on of a polymerization vessel. The deposition of the polymer scale results in 
disadvantages that the yield of the polymer, cooling 
capacity of the polymerization vessel and so on are 
lowered, and that the polymer scale may peel off and mix 
into a polymeric product, thereby consequently impairing 
the quality of products obtained by forming such a 
polymeric product. In addition, removal of deposited 
polymer scale is necessarily very laborious and time-consuming. 
Further, the polymer scale contains unreacted 
monomers, so that there is a risk of physical disorders in 
the human body due to monomers, as having been a very 
serious problem in recent years.  
 In the prior art, for preventing such polymer scale 
deposition on the polymerization vessel inner wall and so 
forth, for example, as locally practiced in suspension 
polymerization of vinyl chloride, there have been known a 
method in which a polymer scale deposition preventive 
agent comprising a polar organic compound such as amine 
compounds, quinone compounds, aldehyde compounds and so on 
is applied to the polymerization vessel inner wall to form 
a coating, and a method in which such compounds are added 
to an aqueous medium for performing suspension 
polymerization (Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No. 
45-30343). However, these methods have the disadvantage that, 
although the polymer scale deposition preventive effect is 
exhibited while polymerization is repeated for up to about 
5 or 6 batches, the preventive effect diminishes if the 
number of repeated batches of polymerization exceeds the 
above (that is, the durability is poor). This point 
exerts emphasized influence especially when a water-soluble 
catalyst is used for polymerization, resulting in 
unsatisfaction from an industrial viewpoint. For overcoming the above disadvantage, for example,
