the same where the image display apparatus includes a rear 

electrode for controlling a first quantity of electrons in 
an electron beam. Also included is an electron beam 

generating source for generating the electrons which travel 
in parallel with each other and an extraction electrode for 

extracting the electron beams from the generated electrons. 
A control electrode is also
 included for selectively 
controlling a second quantity of electrons in the electron 

beams which have passed through the extraction electrode 
and a horizontal deflection electrode for electrostatically 

deflecting the electron beams. A vertical deflection 
electrode is provided for deflecting the electron beams 

which have passed through the horizontal deflection 
electrode. The vertical deflection electrode has a first 

comb-shaped conductive sheet having first parallel members 
and a second comb-shaped conductive sheet having second 

parallel members. The first members and the second members 
are alternatively formed adjacent to each in the horizontal 

direction. Furthermore, the first comb-shaped conductive 
sheet and the second comb-shaped conductive sheet have 

notches formed at regular intervals. The horizontal

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image display 
apparatus to be employed in a television set or a computer 
peripheral display and method of making the same. Cathode ray tubes have been mainly used as the 
image display apparatus for color television sets. Since 
cathode ray tubes have a large depth as compared to the size 
of the screen, it has been difficult to make a flat type 
television set. EL (electro-luminescent) devices, a-plasma displays 
and liquid crystal display devices have been used for flat 
type image display devices. However, these devices have not 
provided satisfactory performance for luminance, contrast, 
and color reproducibility. A conventional flat type screen device is shown in 
Fig. 7. The conventional device includes an image which 
is to be projected onto a fluorescent screen and which is first divided 
into vertical sections vertically having a number of lines. Each image is also divided into horizontal 
subsections. The horizontal and vertical subsections are 
arranged in a matrix so that when the image is displayed 
there is not a gap between subsections. Electron beams are deflected and scanned on the 
screen within each subsection. The electron beams cause red 
fluorescent material, green fluorescent material, and blue 
fluorescent material on the screen to emit colored light. A color image signal controls the amount of 
electrons with the electron beam to produce the image. The 
emitted color light from each subsection forms the entire 
image on the fluorescent screen. The construction of the 
conventional image display apparatus is explained below.  
 Fig. 7 is an internal perspective view of a 
conventional image display apparatus. The image display 
apparatus includes a rear electrode 101, a linear cathode 
102a, 102b, and 102c which are used to generate electrons, 
extraction electrode 103, focusing electrode 105, 
horizontal deflection electrode 106, and vertical deflection 
electrodes 107a and 107b. These components are disposed in a front container 
108 and rear container 109 which hold the components in a 
vacuum. Rear electrode 101 is flat conductive sheet 
disposed in parallel with the linear cathodes 102a, 102b, 
and 102c. Linear cathodes 102a, 102b, and 102c are parallel 
to each other and formed in the vertical direction from top 
to bottom. Each linear cathode 102a, 102b, and 102c extends 
along the horizontal (Y axis) direction to produce an 
electron flow having a nearly uniform current-density-distribution 
in the horizontal (X axis) direction
