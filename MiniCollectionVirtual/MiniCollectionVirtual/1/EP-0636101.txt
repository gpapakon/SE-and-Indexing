<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for stacking a plurality of flat articles on edge, comprising a discharge magazine (16), the discharge magazine including moveable discharge support belts (68a, 68b) and a moveable compression plate (70). A stacker section adjacent the discharge magazine transport articles sequentially into the stack, the stacker section comprising stacker belts (26a, 26b) extending around a plurality of rollers (28a, 28b, 30a, 32a, 32b). The last of the articles in the stack abuts against the stacker belts adjacent one of the rollers (32) to apply a compressive force developed by the stack of flat articles and the compression plate to the one roller. The one roller is movably mounted to the apparatus for movement responsive to increases and decreases in the compressive force. A deflection plate (150) is positioned proximate the one moveable roller to deflect leaning sides of the articles. An actuator element (20) is operatively connected to the one roller and connected to the drive element for activating the drive belts and the discharge support belts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
apparatus and method for stacking sheet-like articles, and 
more particularly to a device for controlling the pressure 
in a stack when stacking sheet-like articles such as 
envelopes that are continuously being fed into the stack. Envelope processing systems, such as mail piece 
processing, sorting and bar code application systems, 
typically include an envelope stacking apparatus at the end 
of the system to secure the sorted mail pieces in a stacked 
position to facilitate orderly removal of the processed 
mail pieces from the system. The stacked mail pieces are 
manually or automatically removed from the stack and/or 
bound by an operator.  
 US-A-4,518,160 reflects the most relevant prior art and 
discloses a stacker in which documents are driven into a 
stacking area by a belt. As items accumulate in the stacking 
area, they apply pressure against a movable roller assembly. 
When a certain degree of pressure has built up, an arm causes a 
contact swith to be thrown, thus actuating a drive motor which 
moves a stacker plate out a notch; when the pressure has again 
built up to a certain degree, the plate is again actuated, and 
so on.  
 In view of the foregoing 
object of the present invention is to 
provide an adjustable deflection element for a stacker 
apparatus of the type described above, which deflection 
plate maintains larger sheet-like articles in a 
substantially upright manner as they enter the stacker, and 
prevents these larger articles from leaning into or against 
the moveable roller, which would result in a false 
detection of pressure against the moveable roller.  
 The above objects and advantages are provided by the 
apparatus defined in claim 1.

stacking apparatus,

envelope conveying belt system and onto an auger element; Fig. 4 is a moveable

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for stacking a plurality of flat articles on 
edge, said apparatus being of the type which includes: 


a discharge magazine (16) for sequentially receiving 
and stacking said flat articles in a stack; 
said discharge magazine (16) including moveable 
discharge support means (68a, 68b) adapted to support said 

stack of articles on edge and moveable compression plate 
means (70) to maintain said articles on edge; 
drive means (69) for controllably moving said 
discharge support means(68a, 68b); 
a stacker section (18) adjacent said discharge 
magazine (16) for transporting articles sequentially into 

said stack, said stacker section (18) comprising a stacker 
support assembly (40,42) and stacker belt means (26a, 26b) 

extending around a plurality of roller means (28, 30, 32) 
supported by the support assembly; 
the last of said articles in said stack abutting 
against said stacker belt means (26) adjacent one of said 

roller means (32) to apply a compressive force developed by 
said stack of flat articles and said compression plate (70) 

to sail one roller means (32); 
said one roller means (32) movably mounted to said 
stacker support assembly (40,42) for movement responsive to 

increases and decreases in said compressive force; and, 
actuator means (62) operatively connected to and 
responsive to movement of said one roller means (32) and 

connected to said drive means for activating said drive 
means (69) and said discharge support means (68a, 68b) to 

transport said stack of flat articles away from said 
stacker section when said compressive force reaches a 

predetermined maximum value; wherein the improvement 
comprises: 


the stacker section (18) comprising deflection means 
(150, 160) proximate the stack of articles for preventing a 

leaning surface of a stacked article from applying said  
 

predetermined maximum value to said roller means (32), 
said deflection means (150, 160) comprising a member with an 

outer deflection surface (154, 162), said deflection surface 
(154, 162) facing outwardly toward said stack of articles and 

extending outwardly to a distance substantially coincident 
with an abutment surface of said stacker belt means (26) 

when said compressive force reaches said predetermined 
maximum value, said deflection means (150) further being 

moveable to vary the distance over which said deflection 
surface may extend. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said member is 
a plate (150, 160) having at least a portion located in a plane 

substantially parallel with a portion of a base plate (40) 
in the stacker support assembly (40, 42). 
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein said plate (150, 160) is 
vertically adjustable about a support member (38) which 

extends perpendicular to said plate. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the position of 
the deflection means is adjustable.
