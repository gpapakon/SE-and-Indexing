<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arc ion
plating device (hereinafter referred to as an AIP
device), a coating device utilizing a vacuum arc
discharge, and an arc ion plating system provided with
the AIP device.An arc ion plating method is a method in which
a vacuum arc discharge is generated between an anode and
a cathode, a target, which are disposed in a vacuum
chamber, and the cathode material is evaporated from the
arc spots generated on the surface of the cathode, a
solid body, and the vapor is accumulated on the surfaces
of works disposed in the vacuum chamber to form a film
on the works. AIP devices which realize an arc ion
plating method are disclosed in Examined Japanese Patent
Publication Nos. SHO 58-3033 and SHO 52-14690 by a
snaper or suplef, and after that various kinds of
improvements are done.With the increasing demand for the application
of the arc ion plating method as a technique of coating
component parts for mass produced products with a hard 
film (for example, piston rings), it is considered to be
an important subject to perform the coating of component
parts with a hard film with high productivity.As a conventional AIP device for realizing
high productivity, for example, an AIP device in which a
work to be coated with a film is placed on a work table
which can be freely taken into or taken out from a
vacuum chamber is known to the public.The basic constitution of such an AIP device
as described in the above will be explained referring to
Fig. 22. Fig. 22(a) is a plan view and Fig. 22(b) is a
longitudinal cross sectional view. There are an anode 2
and a flat-shaped evaporation source (a cathode) 3 which
are fixedly provided and further works 5 which is placed
on a work table 4 in a vacuum chamber 1. An arc power
source 3a is connected to the anode 2 and the
evaporation source 3, and when an arc discharge is
generated between the anode 2 and the evaporation source
3 in a vacuum, a target material on the surface of the
evaporation source 3 is instantaneously evaporated and
spring out into a vacuum as metallic ions 6. The
metallic ions 6 are accelerated by applying a bias
voltage 7 to the works 5 and the metallic ions 6 are
stuck to the surfaces of the works together with the
reaction gas particles 8, and a fine hard film (TiN, 
TiC, TiCN, ZrN, Cr-N, etc.) is generated. The work
table 4 has a built-in gear device which is to be in
gear with a driving gear 9 for making the work 5 rotate
in a direction "a" and at the same time the work table
is also rotated to make the work 5
