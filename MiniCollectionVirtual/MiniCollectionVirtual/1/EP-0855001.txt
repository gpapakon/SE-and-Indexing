<ABSTRACT>
A self-drying insulation system for a pipe or a container (1) having a temperature which periodically is lower than the dew point temperature of the ambient air, comprising an inner capillary-active slot between the surface of the pipe or the container (1) and a surrounding heat insulating layer (3) in which one or more capillary-active openings (5) are provided, which openings connect the inner side of the insulating layer (3) with its outer side, and where the outer side of the insulating layer (3) is surrounded by a water-repellent membrane (6) so as to form an outer slot (7) between the outer side of the insulating layer (3) and the membrane (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulation system for
a pipe or a container having a surface temperature which
for shorter or longer periods is lower than the dew point
temperature of the ambient air, and comprising an inner
capillary-active slot between the surface of the pipe or
the container and a surrounding heat insulating layer in
which one or more capillary-active openings are provided
which connect the inner side of the insulating layer with
its outer side, so that condensed water can be transported
by capillary action from the surface of the pipe
or the container to the outer side of the insulating
layer, from where it can evaporate into the ambient air.EP patent No. 0 528 936 discloses an insulation system of
the above kind, in which a water absorbing material is
disposed within the inner capillary-active slot, which
material extends out through a slot-shaped opening in the
heat insulating layer onto the outer side df the
insulating layer, and wholly or partly around it. The
known insulation system is especially suited for
insulating pipes for transport of cold media, such as
cooling liquid. When condensation of water vapour takes
place on the surface of such pipes, the condensed water
will be absorbed in the inner water absorbing layer, and
from there it will move out by capillary action into the
outer water absorbing layer, from which it evaporates
into the ambient air, the insulation system hereby
becoming self-drying.It has hitherto been presumed that the prerequisite of
the known insulation system being capable of functioning
is that at least a portion of the outer side of the outer 
water absorbing layer is in direct contact with the
ambient air, so that free evaporation of condensed water
can take place from this portion.In cases in which it has been desired to cover the outer
water absorbing layer with a protective layer, e.g. a
plastic or metal sheath, the sheath material has
consequently been provided with holes or slits.For cooling installations e.g. for use in the food
industry, it is required that the installations and
associated cooling tubes and containers can be cleaned
effectively, i.a. by pressure flushing. As a result, e.g.
the food industry has been reluctant to use insulation
systems of the above kind which are provided with an
outer protective sheath with holes or slits.According to the present invention an insulation system
of the kind stated in the preamble is provided, which is
characterized in that the outer side of the insulating
layer is surrounded by a
