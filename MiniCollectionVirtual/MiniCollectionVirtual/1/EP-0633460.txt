<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for the long-term leak monitoring of double-walled container systems, in particular double-walled tank bottoms, which permits, at low cost, the monitoring of, if appropriate, a multiplicity of double-walled tank bottoms cyclically or simultaneously with respect to the occurrence of leaks. By means of the device it can be established whether a leak has occurred in the outer bottom or in the intermediate bottom, the size of the leak and the location of the leak being able to be determined. According to the invention, an intermediate layer is applied to the inside of an outer bottom, the said intermediate layer serving to support the inner bottom. A sensor cable having a variable dielectric constant is laid in the intermediate layer, protected to a large extent. By means of the special intermediate layer, it is firstly possible to dissipate the forces acting on the tank bottoms and, besides, to lay the sensor cable at defined locations which are known in detail. In order to make possible a prescribed propagation of liquid, the intermediate layers have special recesses or are laid in such a manner that the liquid flow is not impeded.

Device for the long-term leakage monitoring in double-walled
container systems, particularly in double-walled

tank bottoms comprising a monitoring space between an
outer base (2) and an inner base (5), the inner base (5)

being supported by an intermediate layer (3), which is
connected to the outer base (2), and also comprising a

liquid-specific sensor cable (6), which is arranged at
least in free sections of the intermediate layer (3), the

sensor cable (6) changing its relative permittivity
locally in accordance with the type and amount of liquid

infiltrating into the monitoring space and the kind as
well as the position of the liquid infiltration being

determined by means of impacting the sensor cable with
pulse echoes,

characterised in that

at least parts of a metallic intermediate layer (3), which
is connected to the outer base (2), are arranged

essentially perpendicular to a downward direction (G) of
the outer base (2) and that the metallic intermediate

layer (3) has recesses (15,16), so that a fluid
infiltrating into the monitoring space (50) can diffuse

substantially along the downwards direction (G) towards
the sensor cable (6), so that the diffusion speed and the

size of a leakage can be determined.
Device according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 
the intermediate layer (3), which is welded to the inner

side of the base, consists of symmetrical angle steel, and
that the recesses (15,16) in the members (4) of the angle

steel are designed crescent-shaped and/or square-shaped
and/or triangular respectively and lying offset and

opposite one another.
Device according to Claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that

the intermediate layer (3) is arranged such that the
sensor cable (6) can be laid in a meandering manner at

least partly within the intermediate layer.
Device according to Claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that

the sensor cable (6) is laid in a spiralling configuration
on the inner side of the outer base (2).
Device according to Claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that,

the sensor cable (6) is laid in concentric circles on the
inner side of the outer base (2) with varying radii, a

plurality of sensor cable inlets and outlets (17,18) being
provided for attaching and connecting the sensor cable (6)

to an evaluation device outwith the tank.
Device according to one of the Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 
the sensor cable (6) is a coaxial cable with a dielectric

which can be reversed by means of liquid or the effect of
moisture, a high frequency pulse echo image of the sensor

cable (6) in its normal state being determined once or
several times for calibration purposes.
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that,

the container system is a substantially cylindrical tank
with a flat bottom, there being a sealed sensor cable

inlet and outlet in the form of a wall connection with
connection pipe(7) above the monitoring space (50),

the sensor cable(6) being led to the intermediate layer
(3) through the interior of the connection pipe (7), by

means of which, by means of the sensor cable inlet or
outlet and the connection pipe (7), the monitoring space

(50) can be tested under pressure if the double-walled
tank bottom is subsequently added.
