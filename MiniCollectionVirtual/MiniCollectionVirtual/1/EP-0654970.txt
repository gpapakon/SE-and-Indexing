<ABSTRACT>
Several solutions are disclosed to the problem of image rectification, i.e. to the realistic orientation of the image when an intraoral camera is used. Means allow the image to be reproduced upright with the right lateral orientation on a monitor independently of the viewing angle of the camera.

Video camera constructed as a handpiece for
observing objects in the mouth of a patient, where the

objective and the image transducer are together
rotatably arranged, or the objective is rotatably

arranged on a non-rotatable part of the handpiece which
contains the image transducer (for example CCD) of the

camera, whereby for this purpose means are present to
acquire the rotational position of the objective, and

where a device is present which reproduces the image on
a monitor, independently of the viewing direction of

the camera, so that it is erect and non-reversed,
whereby either an additional device is built into the

camera in order to acquire the viewing direction of the
camera or another device is present with which the

viewing direction of the camera can be entered
manually, and in that a device is provided with which

the image can be rotated or mirrored on the monitor.
Video camera according to claim 1,
characterized in that electronic devices are provided.
Video camera according to claim 1,
characterized in that an opto-mechanical device, for

example hinged reversing prisms or mirrors, is provided
in the beam path of the camera.
Video camera according to claim 1,
characterized in that the setting and acquisition takes

place in four fundamental directions of downward,
upward, left or right.
Video camera according to claim 1,
characterized in that the rotational position in four

locked positions is acquired with an electronic device,
for example a microswitch or a light barrier.
Video camera according to claim 1,
characterized in that the rotational position is

acquired continuously with an angle transmitter
(potentiometer, digital sensor). 
Video camera according to claim 1,
characterized in that the angle of the objective is

measured by an angle transmitter which acquires the
angle to the perpendicular in each case.
Video camera according to claim 7,
characterized in that the angle transmitter comprises a

weight which is eccentrically secured to the axis of a
potentiometer or digital angle transmitter.
