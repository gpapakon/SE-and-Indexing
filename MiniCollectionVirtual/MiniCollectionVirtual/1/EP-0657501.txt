<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a vulcanized rubber useful for heat resistant 
vibration-isolator which can be obtained by vulcanizing a composition 

comprising: 

(A) 110-175 parts by weight of an oil-extended copolymer comprising 
100 parts by weight of an ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated diene 

copolymer rubber with an intrinsic viscosity [η] of 3 dl/g or more and 

10-75 parts by weight of an extender oil; 
(B) 5-20 parts by weight of a liquid diene polymer with melt viscosity 
of 100-3000 poises at 25 °C, per 100 parts by weight of an ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated 

diene copolymer rubber; and 
(C) 10-80 parts by weight of a reinforcing filler, per 100 parts by 
weight of an ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated diene copolymer rubber; 

with an organic peroxide. 
The vulcanized rubbers of the present invention have an excellent 
thermal stability and durability, a low dynamic spring constant, and 

an excellent processability; they are useful for heat resistant 
vibration-isolator rubber, and are most suitable for, for example, uses 

of vibration-isolator for automobiles for engine mount, strato mount, 
suspension bush, exhaust mount and the like, and uses of vibration-isolator 

for vehicles for railway, vehicles for construction, 
industrial instruments, and instruments for office-automation and the 

like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vulcanized rubber useful for a heat 
resistant vibration-isolator which has an excellent durability and 
processability, and a low dynamic spring constant. Superior characteristics in durability, thermal stability and dynamic 
spring constant are required for a vibration-isolator 
rubber to be widely used in the automobile field. The 
dynamic spring constant is the extent of the change of elastic modulus 
(dynamic shear modulus of elasticity) at a high-frequency vibration 
and is represented by the ratio of dynamic shear modulus of 
elasticity and static shear modulus of elasticity. A dynamic spring 
constant is usually larger than 1, the lower the dynamic spring 
constant is, the superior the vibration-isolator property has. Hitherto, it has been well known that ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated 
diene copolymer rubber is used as rubber material for the 
vibration-isolator rubbers, but that this copolymer is inferior in 
durability although it is superior in thermal stability. On the other hand, the vulcanized rubber with a high molecular weight 
polymer ( its intrinsic viscosity [η] measured at 70°C in xylene is 
usually 2.5 dl/g or more) shows an improved durability, but it is not 
satisfactory from a point of a dynamic spring constant, but, it still 
has a problem that in the processing before vulcanization, there is apt 
to be generated the so-called bagging wherein a rubber composition 
rises to the surface of a roller at roll processing.  
 When a softener or carbon black is added in large amounts to the high 
molecular weight polymer in order to improve the processability, the 
dynamic spring constant of the resulting rubber increases and hence 
its vibration-isolator property becomes inferior. The vulcanized rubber obtained from a rubber composition which 
comprises ethylene-α-olefin-non-conjugated diene copolymer rubber 
and hydrogenated liquid diene polymer (JP-B-3-73584 (1991)) 
is excellent in processability, but suffers from a poor 
dynamic spring constant. With a view to improve both the processability and vibration-isolator 
property of a vulcanized rubber, there has been proposed in 
JP-A-53-22551 (1978) that a low 
molecular weight EPDM is blended with a high molecular weight EPDM. 
But, in this method, the dynamic spring constant of the resulting 
rubber is not satisfactory though the processability and durability 
can surely be improved. In this method, vulcanized rubbers with an 
excellent durability and processability, and a low dynamic spring 
cons
