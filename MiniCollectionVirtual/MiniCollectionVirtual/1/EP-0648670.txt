<ABSTRACT>
Propulsion system, particularly for high-speed boats (5), 
consisting of a propeller (3) having a propeller hood (4') 

positioned downstream relative to the propeller blades, 
and a rudder (7'), and where the propeller hood (4') 

extends entirely or partially along the lower edge of the 
rudder (7'), and where the rudder has approximately the 

same cross section as an airfoil or aircraft wing. The 
propeller hood is preferally designed as a cone or as a 

rotating body the generatrix of which forms a curve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a propulsion system,
particularly for high-speed boats, consisting of a propeller
having a propeller hood positioned downstream relative to the
propeller blades, and a rudder.The present invention is particularly suitable for use in
connection with a propulsion system wherein an inclined
propeller shaft is employed. This should not, however, be
seen as a limitation to the application of the invention.In a conventional propulsion system as shown, for example, on
the attached Figures 1, 2 and 3, particularly for high-speed
boats having an inclined propeller shaft 1, the propeller
shaft is suspended in a bracket 2, and the propeller itself 3
terminates in a propeller hood 4. Propeller shaft l is
angled relative to the boat hull 5 at an angle of Î± relative
to the structural water line 6 of the boat.The boat rudder 7, as shown on Figure l, is positioned
downstream in relation to both the propeller blades 3 and
the actual propeller hood 4. Rudder 7 has a streamlined
configuration, i.e., having an outwardly curved surface on
each side thereof.At high speeds suction will be generated at the after edge of
propeller hood 4. Such suction will substantially reduce the
effect of propeller 3. The propeller will also establish
rotation in the slip stream behind the propeller. This, too,
represents a significant power loss. Such rotational loss
may be partially recovered in the rudder.The present invention therefore aims to reduce or eliminate
the suction behind the propeller hood, at the same time as it
seeks to improve the rudder effect with respect to recovery
of rotational loss behind the propeller. According to the invention, therefore, the propulsion system
mentioned in the introduction above is characterized in that
the propeller hood extends entirely or partially along the
lower edge of the rudder, and that the rudder has approximately
the same cross section as an airfoil or aircraft
wing.According to an embodiment form of the propulsion system, the
propeller hood is shaped like a cone. Alternatively, the
propeller hood may be designed as a rotating body the
generatrix of which forms a curve.The invention will now be described in more detail with
reference to the appended drawings.Figure 1 is a view of a propulsion system according to the
prior art.Figure 2 is a view of section II-II in Figure 1.Figure 3 is an elevational end view of section III in
Figure 1.Figure 4 is a side view of the propulsion system in accordance
with the present invention.Figure 5 is a view of section V-V
