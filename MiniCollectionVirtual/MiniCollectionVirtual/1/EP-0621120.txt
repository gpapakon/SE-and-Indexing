<ABSTRACT>
A machine for making plastic tubing including a plurality of separate 
carriages (50) for carrying mold blocks (30) about the continuous 

path. First (120,122) and second (64) 
wheel pairs on opposite sides of each carriage (50) ride on first (126) 

and second (66) tracks respectively 
through a molding section of the path. An offset wheel is disposed between 

the wheels of each pair and rides on guide tracks associated with and facing 
oppositely 

to the first (126) and second (66) tracks respectively through the 
molding section. Each mold 

block (30) is a plurality of sub-blocks secured end to end, with each 
sub-block having an 

arcuate face and corrugated with not more than one complete wavelength. 
Vacuum 

channels (238) about sub-block end surfaces connect the block face to a 
vacuum port (240/316). 

Cooling water channels (250) about sub-block end surfaces connect 
to water inlet (296) and 

discharge ports (320) for selectively circulating cooling water 
through the blocks (30). The 

mold block ports (280) communicate with respective vacuum, water supply, 
and water 

discharge channels in a longitudinal supply tray along which the mold 
blocks travel 

through the molding section. A mold train drive (70) engages a 
selected number of 

carriages (50) at the beginning of the mold tunnel (34) to continuously 
drive the carriages (50) 

along the mold tunnel (34). A shuttle drive (70) follows the continuous 
path (32) through a shuttle 

area and spaced from the path along a substantial portion of the mold 
tunnel (34), and 

includes first and second carriage engaging sections at substantially 
opposite points 

along the drive so that a carriage (50) at the end of the mold tunnel 

(34) becomes engaged by 
one shuttle drive (72) engaging section while the other shuttle drive 

(72) engaging section 
engages a carriage (50) at the beginning of the mold tunnel (34). The 

shuttle drive (72) accelerates 
when one of the carriage (50) engaging sections enters the shuttle 

drive (72) portion spaced 
from the continuous track path to disengage a carriage (50) at the 

beginning of the mold 
tunnel (34), and decelerates to the speed of the mold train drive (70) 

as an engaged carriage reaches the beginning of the mold tunnel (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward corrugators, and more particularly
toward corrugators for making corrugated plastic tubing.A well known method for manufacturing corrugated pipes is to extrude a
tube of thermoplastic from a head and then conform that tube to the interior of a
corrugated mold tunnel formed by mold blocks. The mold blocks typically come in
pairs and mate together to form a portion of the mold tunnel, and the thermoplastic
is either blown into its shape (by pressure created within the mold tunnel) or by
vacuum (where vacuum draws the air from around the mold tunnel).Structures which have been used in the vacuum method of manufacture
are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,318,872, 4,439,130, and 4,718,844. These
patents all address the problem of drawing a uniform, strong vacuum around the
entirety of the mold blocks which are continually moving during the molding process.
As can be seen from these structures, it is difficult to inexpensively form any
such mold block.Certain problems naturally occurring in all such machines are exaggerated
in machines which are used to make larger diameter tubes (for example, up to
four feet in diameter and more).Conforming the thermoplastic to the larger diameter mold blocks with
a uniformity of wall thickness can be difficult.Cooling of the larger mold blocks is also difficult. Of course, if the
machine is used continuously over a long period of time, inadequate cooling of the 
mold blocks can result in improperly elevated temperatures through the molding
process and degradation of the quality of the molded tubes.Moving and properly aligning multiple mold blocks is also naturally
more difficult with larger diameter mold blocks due to the mere size and weight of
the parts involved and their interaction with other components. In clamshell type
machines, for example (with the mold blocks supported on a carriage on one side),
any forces incurred on the other side of the mold blocks naturally involves a larger
moment arm about the carriages, with the result being that such structures can be
more susceptible to "sawtooth" type arrangements through the mold tunnel, with
successive mold blocks being tilted slightly rather than perfectly aligned with the axis
of the mold tunnel.Further, cost effectiveness of the machines making larger diameter
tubes is a significant factor, since the size and cost of each mold block is significantly
higher than the cost of mold blocks used to make small tubes. Since numerous
such mold blocks are required to operate any
