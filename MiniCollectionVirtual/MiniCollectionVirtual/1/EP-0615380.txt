<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for correcting for changes in the charge transfer efficiency of a 
charge coupled device (12) includes a light source (38) for providing synthetic reference 

images to a preselected portion (26) of the image array (16) of the charge coupled device 
(12). The initial synthetic reference image is compared with subsequent synthetic 

references images to determine the changes in the charge transfer efficiency of the charge 
coupled device (12). The changes are used to correct images form the image array (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a charge coupled device apparatus and, 
in particular, relates to one such apparatus having means for correcting for changes in the 
charge transfer efficiency of the charge coupled device (CCD). Charge coupled devices are well known in the art and are widely used in the field 
of image processing. These devices are frequently used to provide electronic signal 
representations of incident electromagnetic radiation intensities of a particular spectral 
band. The most common spectral band used for CCD image processing is the visible 
band. In general, the more conventional CCD's are fabricated from silicon in order to 
take advantage of the inherent characteristics of the silicon crystal lattice. Each atom of 
crystalline silicon is covalently bonded to its neighboring silicon atom resulting in an 
energy band gap of about 1.12 eV. To break one of the covalent bonds, and thereby 
create an electron-hole pair, an energy greater than the band gap energy is required. 
Electromagnetic radiation in the form of photons, having wavelengths in the visible 
spectrum possess such energy. Hence, light in the visible spectrum results in the creation 
of electron-hole pairs in the silicon lattice in relation to the intensity. i. e., the number of 
photons per unit of area, of the incident radiation. In order to measure the electronic charge produced by the incident photons in such 
a CCD a means for collecting the charge is provided. Typically, this collecting means is 
provided in the form of a conductive gate structure formed in an array of rows and 
columns. This array of rows and columns defines an array of image elements generally 
referred to as pixels. Thus, it becomes possible, by applying the appropriate electrical 
potential to the various gate elements, to cause the free electrons created by incident 
photons to migrate along a row, or column. In this fashion an electronic signal 
representative of the intensity of the light radiation impinging upon the pixels can be  
 
provided as an output of the array, It is important to recognize that the electronic charges 
from the pixels furthest away from the output of the array undergo thousands of transfers 
depending on the size of the array. Hence, it will be recognized that the charge transfer efficiency, i.e., the efficiency 
with which an electronic charge is moved from one pixel to an adjacent pixel is a critical 
parameter of a CCD. The charge transfer efficiency of a CCD becomes of particular 
importance when
