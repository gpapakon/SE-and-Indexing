<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides crosslinking fluoropolymer 
compositions suitable for making coatings such as protective 
coatings, release coatings, optical coatings; for use as an 
adjuvant for other polymeric compositions; and for 
encapsulating applications. Fluoropolymers have found widespread use in demanding 
applications where their non-stick properties, good thermal 
and chemical resistance, toughness and abrasion resistance 
are being used to advantage, such as in coatings. The present invention provides two-component (or multi-component) 
compositions of fluorinated polymers, which 
components each carry different active groups which are 
capable of forming crosslinks without use of crosslinking 
agents. The individual components can be made under 
free-radical polymerization conditions. These components are 
mixed in desired proportions to obtain crosslinkable 
compositions, which can be cured, as by application of heat. 
The cross-linked compositions are amorphous and optically 
clear, and have low refractive indexes. Coatings of these 
cross-linked compositions are strongly adherent to 
substrates, including glass, polymer films and crystal 
substrates. They also have good flexibility, toughness, and 
abrasion resistance. In accordance with the present invention, there are 
provided novel crosslinkable fluoropolymer composition 
comprising a first polymeric component A, and a second 
polymeric component B, each having the general formula  
 
 
wherein 
(1) r and s are independently 0 or 1; (2) t and v each ranges from 0 to about 0.5; (3) (t + v) ranges from 0 to about 0.5; (4) Y is a -(CH2)q-RF group, wherein 
(a) -(CH2)q- may be straight chain or 
branched, and q is an integer of from 1 
to about 18; (b) -RF is a fluoroalkyl group, straight 
chain or branched, having from 1 to 
about 40 carbon atoms, and having at 
least one terminal -CF2X group wherein X 
is H or F; (5) Z is a crosslinking group selected 
from the group consisting of H, 
-(CH2CH2-O)m-CH2-FM and -(CH2)m-FM, wherein m is 
an integer of from 1 to about 18; and H and FM 
each are terminal functional moieties, 
wherein FM is -NH2, 
 
or -CR2-OH; (6) R1 and R2 are independently selected from the 
group consisting of 
(a) H; (b) -CH3; (c) -COOY; (d) -COOZ; (e) -COOR3, or mixtures thereof,  
wherein Y and Z each have the afore-stated  
 
meaning, and R3 is alkyl, straight chain or 
branched, having from 1 to about 18 carbon 
atoms;  
with the provisos that: 
(1) (t + v) and r may not both be 0 together; (2) when (t + v) is 0, R1 must
