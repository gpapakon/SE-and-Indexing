<ABSTRACT>
2.1. Known relevant measurement methods and measurement arrangements have the disadvantage that their measuring resolution falls far short of the resolution which can be achieved using other methods, and that these methods are unsuitable for measuring sections which vary within an extreme range. 2.2. This disadvantage is overcome in the case of the measurement method according to the invention by using two measuring interferometers with respective measuring sections to which the beam of the same laser is applied. In this process, the reference section formed from the arithmetic sum or difference of the two measuring sections is kept constant. In this case, two interfering component beams are used to generate in each case at least one interference signal which is measured by means of photodetectors. In the actual measurement method, the air wavelength of the laser beam is continuously tuned between two wavelength values within a wavelength region free from modal discontinuities, and the integral phase changes in the respective interference signals is detected during the wavelength modulation. The measured distance can be determined from these phase changes and the length of the reference section. 2.3. The measurement method and the laser interferometer arrangement are especially suitable for absolute distance measurements.
