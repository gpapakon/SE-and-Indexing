<ABSTRACT>
A ski is implemented by a lower assembly (11) with a 
running surface (11d) and an upper assembly (12) integral 

with the lower assembly, and the upper assembly is a 
lamination of a thermosetting resin-impregnated non-woven 

fabric member (12a )and an outer cover film (12b) of 
thermoplastic resin covering the lower assembly; the 

thermosetting resin-impregnated non-woven fabric member 
allows a forming die (13) to transfer a decorative pattern 

(13c/13d) on the outer cover film without change of a 
designed flexibility of the lower assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pair of skis for sliding 
on snow and, more particularly, to a structure of the ski 
and a process of fabricating the ski. A pair of skis is used for sliding on snow, and a 
typical example of the prior art ski is illustrated in 
0figure 1 of the drawings. The prior art ski is imaginary 
split into a lower assembly 1 and an upper assembly 2. The lower assembly 1 comprises a core member 1a made 
from an aluminum honeycomb, a wood plate or a foam plastic 
plate, upper and lower reinforcing plates 1b and 1c of 
fiber-reinforced plastic or high strength aluminum alloy 
bonded to the upper surface and the lower surface of the 
core member 1a, a sole plate 1d of ultra high molecular 
polyethylene and edges 1e and 1f of carbon steel or 
stainless steel attached to both sides of the lower 
reinforcing plate 1c and the sole plate 1d. On the other hand, the upper assembly 2 comprises a 
curved outer cover film 2a of nylon a filler 2b of 
urethane foam attached at both side edges thereof to the 
edges 1e and 1f and a filler 2b of urethane foam filling a  
 
hollow space between the curved outer cover film 2a and the 
lower assembly 1. In order to fabricate the prior art ski, the 
manufacturer prepares the lower assembly 1, and the upper 
assembly 2 is formed by using a forming die 3 as shown in 
figure 2A. Namely, the curved outer cover film 2a is 
placed on the inner surface of the lower block 3a of the 
forming die 3, and the upper block 3b is coupled to the 
lower block 3a. A cavity is formed between the inner 
surface of the lower block 3a and the inner surface of the 
upper block 3b, and foamable urethane resin 2c is 
introduced into the cavity. The urethane resin 2c is 
foamed, and the upper assembly 2 is shaped in the cavity. The upper assembly 2 is taken out from the die 3, and 
is assembled with the lower assembly 1 as shown in figure 
2B. The lower assembly 1 is bonded or welded to the upper 
assembly 2. Decorative marks, letters and/or logograms are 
embossed on the inner surface of the lower block 3a, and 
the decorative marks, the letters and/or the logograms are 
transferred to the outer surface of the curved outer cover 
layer 2a during the shaping work in the die 3. Thus, while the lower assembly 1 and the upper  
 
assembly 2 are produced independently, the letters and the 
logograms are transferred to the curved outer cover film 2a 
in the die 3, and the transfer work does not have a bad 
influence on the strength of the lower assembly 1 and, 
accordingly, the prior

A ski for sliding on snow, comprises: 

a) a lower assembly (11) providing a mechanical strength 
to said ski, and having a running surface (11d) for sliding 

on said snow and edges (11e; 11f) provided on both sides of 
said running surface; and 
b) an upper assembly (12) integral with said lower 
assembly and having a relief (12c/12d; 22b; 32b) on an 

outer surface thereof, 
characterized in that 
   said upper assembly comprises 

   a resin-impregnated non-woven fabric member (12a) 
covering said lower assembly except for said running 

surface and said edges, and having a resiliency after a 
thermal s
etting, and 
   an outer cover layer (12b; 22; 32) of a synthetic 

resin covering said resin- impregnated non-woven fabric 
member and having an upper surface with said relief. 
The ski as set forth in claim 1, in which said resin-impregnated 
non-woven fabric member contains fibers with 

low-resiliency. 
The ski as set forth in claim 2, in which said fibers 
are selected from the group consisting of polyester fibers, 

rayon fibers and nylon fibers. 
The ski as set forth in claim 2, in which a 
thermosetting resin selected from the group consisting of 

epoxy and unsaturated polyester is impregnated into said 
fibers. 
The ski as set forth in claim 4, in which said 
thermosetting resin ranges from 500 weight parts to 1200 

weight parts for each 100 weight parts of said fibers. 
The ski as set forth in claim 1, in which said 
synthetic resin is a thermoplastic resin selected from the 

group consisting of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and 
nylon elastomer. 
A process of fabricating a ski for sliding on snow, 
comprising the steps of: 


a) preparing a die unit (13) having a first block (13b) 
and a second block (13a) with a pattern (13c/13d) for 

producing a relief (12c/ 12d; 22; 32) and a lower assembly 
(11) providing a mechanical strength to said ski and having 

a running surface (11d) for sliding on said snow and edges 
(11e/11f) provided on both sides of said running surface; 
b) covering said lower assembly (11) with a lamination 
of a resin-impregnated non-woven fabric sheet (14) and a 

thermoplastic resin film (15) except for said running 
surface and said edges, the resin impregnated in the non-woven 

 
fabric being a thermosetting resin; and 
c) pressing said lower assembly (11) covered with said 
resin-impregnated non-woven fabric sheet (14) and said 

thermoplastic resin film (15) between said first block 
(13b) and said second block (13a) under application of heat 

for shaping said ski with the relief (12c/12d) transferred 
from said pattern (13c/13d) in said second block. 
The process as set forth in 7, in which components 
(11a/11b/11c/11d/11e/11f) of said lower assembly (11) are 

integrated before said step a).

integrated in step c) together with said resin-impregnated 
non-woven fabric sheet (14) and said thermoplastic resin 

film (15). 
The process as set forth in claim 7, in which hollow 
micro particles are dispersed in a non-woven fabric sheet 

before impregnating a thermosetting resin into said non-woven 
fabric sheet, thereby preparing said resin-impregnated
