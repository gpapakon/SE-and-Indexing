<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aluminoxy products. The term 
organo-aluminoxy as used herein refers to organic compounds having a 
plurality of aluminum atoms each bound to at least two oxygen atoms. In 
another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of modifying 
organic aluminoxanes to make them suitable for use in particle form 
polymerization. In still another aspect, the present invention relates to 
a metallocene catalyst comprising a modified organic aluminoxane. In still 
another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for polymerizing 
olefins using the modified organic aluminoxane. Organic aluminoxanes are one form of aluminoxy compound. Organic 
aluminoxanes can be produced by the partial hydrolysis of hydrocarbyl 
aluminum compounds. Such aluminoxanes have been found useful in a variety 
of chemical reactions, including utility as catalyst components for 
polymerization catalysts, especially in high activity metallocene catalyst 
systems. The combination of such aluminoxanes with metallocenes has been 
shown to be useful for certain types of olefin polymerization. One of the 
earliest patents containing such a disclosure is U.S. 3,242,099, the  
 
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such metallocene 
catalysts have been used in homogeneous solution polymerization. Since 
such homogeneous catalyst systems are soluble in the polymerization medium 
it is generally observed that the resulting polymer has low bulk density. Further, attempts to use metallocene/aluminoxane catalysts in a 
slurry or particle form type polymerization have not heretofore been found 
to be commercially feasible. In slurry or particle form polymerization, 
the polymerization conditions are selected such that the polymer forms as 
discrete particles which are insoluble in the polymerization reaction 
medium during the polymerization. It has been observed that when such 
particle form polymerizations are carried out in the presence of a 
metallocene/aluminoxane catalyst system, large amounts of polymeric 
material are formed on the surfaces of the polymerization vessel. This 
fouling is particularly detrimental in a particle form process since it 
produces an adverse effect on the heat transfer and also results in the 
need for periodic if not continuous cleaning of the reactor. In order to 
have a metallocene/aluminoxane catalyst useful in a commercial continuous 
particle form process such as those using a loop reactor, it is necessary 
to have a catalyst system which will
