<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLEREFRIGERANT COMPOSITIONS INCLUDINGPENTAFLUORODIMETHYL ETHERFIELP QF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to refrigerant compositions that include pentafluorodimethyl ether as a component. This invention also relates to binary azeotropic or azeotrope-like compositions that include pentafluorodimethyl ether, said compositions being useful as cleaning agents, expansion agents for polyolefins and polyurethanes, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, heat transfer media, gaseous dielectrics, fire extinguishing agents, power cycle working fluids, polymerization media, paniculate removal fluids, carrier fluids, buffing abrasive agents, and displacement drying agents.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFluorinated hydrocarbons have many uses, one of which is as a refrigerant. Such refrigerants include dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) and chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22).In recent years it has been pointed out that certain kinds of fluorinated hydrocarbon refrigerants released into the atmosphere may adversely affect the stratospheric ozone layer. Although this proposition has not yet been completely established, there is a movement toward the control of the use and the production of certain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) under an international agreement. Accordingly, there is a demand for the development of refrigerants that have a lower ozone depletion potential than existing refrigerants while still achieving an acceptable performance in refrigeration applications. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have been suggested as replacements for CFCs and HCFCs since HFCs have no chlorine and therefore have zero ozone depletion potential.In refrigeration applications, a refrigerant is often lost during operation through leaks in shaft seals, hose connections, soldered joints and broken lines. In addition, the refrigerant may be released to the atmosphere during maintenance procedures on refrigeration equipment. If the refrigerant is not a pure component or an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition, the refrigerant 

composition may change when leaked or discharged to the atmosphere from the refrigeration equipment, which cause the refrigerant to become flammable or to have poor refrigeration performance.Accordingly, it is desirable to use as a refrigerant a single fluorinated hydrocarbon or an azeotropic or azeotrope-like composition that includes one or more fluorinated hydrocarbons.Fluorinated hydrocarbons may also be used a cleaning agent or solvent to clean, for example, electronic circuit
