<ABSTRACT>
A catheter (10) with several independent lumens (36, 40, 44, 48) for accepting probes (82) and for introducing fluid into a body cavity is disclosed. The first lumen (36) is circular in cross-section, and has a cross-sectional dimension of approximately half the maximum outer dimension of the catheter body (12). The second lumen (40) is crescent-shaped in cross-section and occupies at least a quarter of an arc around the cross-section of the catheter body (12). The large cross-section of the second lumen (40) allows for a high fluid flow rate through the lumen (40). The third lumen (44) allows for inflation of an inflation balloon (when present), and the fourth lumen (48) allows for the passing of a portion of an instrument along the length of the lumen. A probe (82) is also disclosed. The probe transducer portion (92) is constructed of a crystal hollow cylinder (94) with an inside lead (96) attached to the inner surface (106) of the crystal cylinder (94). One end (116) of the outside lead (98) is positioned close to the outer surface (108), in a plane (120) tangential to the outer surface (108), an is coupled to the outer surface (108) of the crystal cylinder (94) by a thin sputtered layer (104) of conductive material. The probe transducer (92) also includes a layer (100) of acoustically absorbing material on the proximal end (124) of the crystal (94), and layer (102) of acoustically coupling material on the distal end (126) of the crystal cylinder (94). The transducer element simultaneously generates an axially oriented signal beam (144) at one frequency and a radially oriented signal beam (146) at a different frequency. The signal beams (144, 146) are analyzed to calculate the blood flow area (A) and the blood flow velocity (V), the product of which is the blood flow rate (Q).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved
intravascular catheter in combination with at least two probes,
more particularly,
to a catheter
which accepts various
probes for sensing biological conditions and parameters and
which allows high fluid flow rate for introducing fluids
irrespective of the presence of sensing instruments in the
catheter, thereby reducing the risk of patient
complications.Numerous catheters exist for sensing, diagnosing and
treating various biologic conditions. For example, there
are cardiac catheters used for angioplasty, for measuring
cardiac output, such as thermodilution catheters, pulmonary
artery wedge pressure monitors, blood flow monitors and
temperature monitors. In use, a transport catheter is
initially introduced into an appropriate vessel or body
cavity. In the case of a thermodilution catheter, for
example, the transport catheter may be introduced into an
appropriate vein. Thereafter, the thermodilution catheter
is inserted and passed through the right atrium and
ventricle and out to the pulmonary artery. After the
catheter is properly positioned and the balloon inflated, 
various readings can be taken of left heart pressure, for
example, and pulmonary artery temperature. The same
measurements may be taken a number of times while the
catheter is in place. However, if the patient's condition
changes and requires other measurements or diagnosis, or
additional information is desired, such as may be required
in view of the results obtained by the thermodilution
measurements, the thermodilution catheter must be removed
and substituted with a different catheter for such
measurements. The subsequent catheter exchange increases
the possibility of infection through the introduction of a
second catheter and increases the probability of other
problems such as venous puncture.Another problem with frequent catheter exchange is that
only physicians are authorized to remove and replace
catheters and probes in the patient's body. However, after
a physician has inserted and positioned the catheter in the
patient's body, a trained nurse is permitted to insert,
position, and replace probes within the catheter, since the
probe does exit the catheter. Therefore, it is desirable
to use a transport catheter in connection with a probe,
such that the probe can be used within the transport
catheter without the removal and replacement of the
transport catheter.Thermodilution catheters, such as the well known
Swan-Ganz catheters, generally provide for introducing
fluids into the patient
