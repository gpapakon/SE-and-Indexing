<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure sensor for controlling air
conditioning systems and the like.Various types of pressure measurement devices used for system
control, for example of motor vehicle air conditioning systems,
have been known for some time. Such devices are proportional
pressure sensors, which can be of mechanical or electronic type.Classical proportional pressure sensors operate by converting the
deformation of a suitable elastic diaphragm into a corresponding
movement of a slider contact along a suitable calibrated resistor,
hence adjusting the energization current of the relative indicator
instrument.Sensors of this type suffer from the well known problems deriving
from the rubbing of the slider contact along the surface of the
calibrated resistor, with consequent deterioration of both.A further drawback is the difficulty of converting small
mechanical deformations of the elastic diaphragm into appreciable
movements of the slider. For this reason such sensors suffer from
poor linearity, stability and precision, and are therefore of poor
reliability. In contrast, proportional sensors of electronic type are extremely
linear, stable and precise, their operation being based on the
deformation of an elastic diaphragm, as in the case of mechanical
sensors.For this reason the main object of the present invention is to
provide a pressure sensor for controlling air conditioning systems
and the like which combines the structural characteristics of
mechanical devices with those of electronic devices, to hence
achieve a greater overall reliability.A further object is to provide a proportional pressure sensor
which has a high degree of protection, is of small overall size
and is simple to apply.A further object of the present invention is to provide a pressure
sensor which is extremely precise and stable both with time and
with varying temperature.A further object, related to the aforesaid objects, is to reduce
if not obviate the aforesaid drawbacks of known sensors.These objects are attained by a pressure sensor as defined by the subject-matter of claim 1 and the other appended claims.The functional and structural characteristics and the advantages
of a device according to the present invention will be more 
apparent from the detailed description given by way of non-limiting
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
which:
