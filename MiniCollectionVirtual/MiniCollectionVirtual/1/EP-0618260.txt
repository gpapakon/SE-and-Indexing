<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermoplastic 
elastomer composition having improved compression set, 
low temperature properties, blocking resistance and 
moldability. With respect to elastomer materials, there has been 
an increasing demand for improvement of their properties 
year by year. Particularly, in the field of automobiles, 
excellent compression set is demanded for materials of 
e.g. glass runs, weather strips and flush-mount-moles. Heretofore, soft vinyl chloride resins have been 
widely used as such materials, since they have flexible 
rubber-like texture and they are superior to vulcanized 
rubber in the moldability, weather resistance and tinting 
properties, and they have an advantage also from the 
viewpoint of costs. However, they are inferior to 
vulcanized rubber in the compression set, and their 
softening point is low, whereby their application for 
high temperatures has been limited. An attempt has been  
 
made for improvement by modifying the vinyl chloride 
resins to have high degrees of polymerization, but no 
satisfactory results have been obtained. Various proposals have also been made with an aim to 
improve the compression set of the vinyl chloride resins 
wherein nitrile rubbers having crosslinked structures are 
kneaded with vinyl chloride resins. However, such 
compositions are inferior in the processability, and have 
drawbacks in the productivity. Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 
309546/1988 discloses a process for producing an 
elastomer composition which comprises, as resin 
components, a chlorinated polyethylene, a vinyl chloride 
resin and a partially crosslinked acrylonitrile-butadiene 
copolymer. However, in this process, it is essential to 
use a vinyl chloride resin and to first prepare a 
precursor composition having the vinyl chloride resin, 
the partially crosslinked acrylonitrile-butadiene 
copolymer and a plasticizer uniformly dispersed and 
kneaded, and then add the chlorinated polyethylene and a 
crosslinking agent thereto, followed by blending and 
kneading. This process has a feature that the elastomer 
composition itself has a crosslinked structure. This 
publication discloses the effects of the composition such 
as oil resistance, weather resistance, ozone resistance 
and heat resistance, but does not teach a technical 
concept that good high-temperature creep characteristics 
are obtainable without crosslinking the composition, as 
in the present invention.
