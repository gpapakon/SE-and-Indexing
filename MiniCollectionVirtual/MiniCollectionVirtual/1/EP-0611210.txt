<ABSTRACT>
This method for managing a computer resource with any management system (MAN) allows the handling of any application (APP) whose symbol table (ST) is contained in the executable. To do this, an agent (AGE) is created in conformity with the standard management protocol (SNMP), this agent being parametrisable by means of the configuration file (CF) which it contains. Once created, the agent (AGE), via on the one hand the symbol table (ST) giving the correspondence between the name of a variable and its layout in memory and on the other hand a call to a system function (SC) of the analysis procedure type, directly accesses the memory area whose layout is given by the symbol table (ST) so as to allow appropriate processing depending on the enquiries of the management system (MAN).

Method for administering an application by an objects 
administration system within a network according to an 

administrative protocol, the executable of the 
application containing the table of symbols of the 

application, characterised in that, in the first place, 
an information processing device known as an agent is 

created in accordance with the administrative protocol, 
it being possible to assign parameters to this agent by 

means of a configuration file contained within the 
agent and, via on the one hand the table of symbols of 

the application giving the correspondence between the 
name of a variable and its memory location, and on the 

other hand a calling up of a system function used in 
the analysis processes making it possible to plot the 

execution and monitor the processing of the 
application, said agent, once created, directly 

accesses the memory zone, the location of which is 
given by the table of symbols, thus making it possible 

to effect appropriate processing in relation to the 
application, as a function of the requests from the 

administration system. 
Method for administering an application by an 
administration system according to Claim 1, 

characterised in that, in order to create the agent in 
accordance with the administrative protocol, in a first 

stage the application is modelled in the form of a set 
of administrative objects, in a second stage the coding 

of said agent is effected according to an interface 
authorising the dialogue concerning the administrative 

objects between the administration system and the 
application concerned whereas in a third stage the 

description of the administrative objects is presented 
to the administration system by means of the 

configuration file contained in the agent.  
 
Method for administering an application by an 
administration system according to Claim 1 or 2, 

characterised in that the configuration file contained 
in the agent created contains the list of variables, 

the list of objects and the correspondence between 
variables and objects. 
Use of the method according to one of the preceding 
claims, the application running on a UNIX system, the 

agent, once created, controlling the launching of the 
application to be administered, the agent then 

corresponding to a "father" process while the 
application itself corresponds to a "son" process 

launched by the "father" process, then via the table of 
symbols and a system call of the UNIX PTRACE type, the 

agent performing the desired processing on the 
application.
