<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a lead frame (12) with enhanced adhesion to a polymer resin (28). The lead frame (12) is coated with a thin layer (20) containing chromium, zinc or a mixture of chromium and zinc. A mixture of chromium and zinc with the zinc-to-chromium ratio in excess of about 4:1 is most preferred. The coated lead frames (12) exhibit improved adhesion to a polymeric resin (28).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to lead frames
for electronic packages. More particularly, the
invention relates to enhancing the bond between a lead
frame and polymer adhesive by depositing a coating layer
containing chromium and zinc.One type of package used to house microelectronic
devices, such as silicon based integrated circuits, is a
molded plastic package. The package is low cost, easy
to assemble and provides adequate protection of the
device from water vapor and other contaminants. During
assembly, a device is mounted on a die attach paddle and
electrically interconnected to the lead frame. The die
attach paddle, electronic device and inner portion of
the lead frame are then encapsulated in a molding resin
such as by transfer molding. The resin forms a hard,
relatively moisture impervious shell to protect both the
device and electrical connections.After encapsulation, the outer leads of the lead
frame may be soldered to a printed circuit board or
other external device. The temperature of the package
during soldering may rise to around 260Â°C. Any water
vapor trapped within the package will convert to steam
and expand. One site for the accumulation of water is
under the die attach paddle. When the accumulated water
expands, the base of the molded plastic package deforms,
leading to what is known as the "pop corn effect".Moisture also penetrates the plastic package
along the interface between the leads and molding 
resin. The adhesion between the resin and leads is
primarily mechanical in nature and a gap may exist
between the leads and encapsulation. Moisture travels
through the gap, accumulating at the die attach paddle.Various mechanisms to improve the bond between
the lead frame and molding resin have been proposed.
For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,862,246 to Masuda et al
discloses forming a series of hemispherical depressions
in the die attach paddle to increase the adhesion of the
paddle to the molding resin.A layer of dull nickel applied to a lead frame
has been found to enhance the epoxy bond as disclosed in
U.S. Patent No. 4,888,449 to Crane et al. The Crane et
al patent also discloses coating metallic package
components with a metal or metal alloy selected from the
group consisting of nickel, tin, cobalt, chromium,
molybdenum, tungsten, titanium, zirconium, hafnium,
niobium, tantalum, germanium, aluminum and alloys of the
foregoing metals.Another patent which discloses a metallic coating
to improve the adhesion between a metallic lead frame
and a polymer resin is U.S. Patent No.
