<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a plastic cap for dispensing liquids to be connected to the neck of a deformable container and includes a main body (2) having a first outer wall (3) that can be assembled to the neck (5) of the container and is coaxial with respect to a second wall (6) that can be introduced inside the neck of the container, said main body having a generally cylindrical part (12) that is hollow and provided with fins (14) for fastening a suction pipe (15) for drawing the liquid out of the container, and with a non-axial outlet (13) for the liquid, said body being provided in its front part with a hook (9) placed near the perimetrical edge of said body, suitable for cooperating with a corresponding projection of the cover, and with a cover (20) connected with said main body (2) by means of a hinge (11), said cover having a hollow cylindrical element (21) in the middle and being provided, in correspondence with its inner edge, with a hook-shaped projection (10) cooperating with the corresponding hook (9) of the main body; said cap being characterized in that in said main body (2), on the base surface where the hook (9) is fixed and under said hook (9), there is a hole (8) through which the male of the mould passes during the moulding of the cap with thermoplastic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is a plastic cap particularly suitable
for dispensing liquids, which can be connected to the
neck of a deformable container. We are referring in particular
to plastic caps in which an outflow duct is connected
with a pipe for drawing the liquid from the bottom
of the container.The known types of plastic caps for dispensing liquids
substantially have a body connected with the neck
of the container, said body being provided with a central
part that projects outwards and is connected to a pipe
drawing out the liquid. These caps are also provided
with a cover connected with the central body of the cap
by means of a hook and they can be separated from
said central body by deforming the container with the
pressure of the fingers.According to the known technique, this sort of caps
is carried out by means of a complex mould, in order to
obtain the tooth that belongs to the body of the cap and
sticks out of the base of said body upwards, in such a
way as to cooperate with a corresponding hook situated
on the cover. Both the patents DE-C-3632057 and the
patent FR-A-2 591 571 concern a plastic cap for dispensing
liquids in which the cover closes against that
part of the cap that is fixed to the bottle by means of a
hook belonging to said part.The drawing regarding the practical application of
the patent clearly shows that the hook is obtained by
means of a mould with at least a carriage moving transversally
with respect to the opening and closing direction
of the mould.A purpose of the invention is to obtain a cap structured
so that it can be carried out by means of a very
simple mould without transversal carriages.Another purpose to be reached is that the cap of
the invention has a sealing capacity at least equivalent
to that of the caps of the same kind known up to now.All the purposes mentioned above and others that
will be better highlighted below, have been achieved by
a plastic cap for dispensing liquids to be connected to
the neck of a deformable container, which is designed
according to the first claim.Advantageously, according to the invention, due to
the presence of a hole in the cap there is the possibility
of moulding the cap by means of a substantially very
simple mould without carriages, since, as it will be
observed later on, the moulding takes place by direct
clamping with a single movement of the mould along its
only clamping axis.Even with a hole at the end of the edge of the cap
the outflow of the liquid is prevented since the cap seal
with respect to the neck of the container is

<CLAIMS>
A moulded plastic cap for dispensing liquids to be
connected to the neck of a deformable container

and comprising :

a main body (2) having a first substantially
cylindrical outer wall (3) to be connected to the

neck (5) of the container and coaxial with
respect to a second cylindrical wall (5) to be

introduced inside the neck of the container,
said main body being provided in the middle

with a generally hollow cylindrical part (12),
projecting upwards the walls (3,6) thereof

being provided with fins (14) for fastening a
suction pipe (15) far drawing the liquid out of

the container, and having a non-axial outlet
(13) for the liquid, said main body being provided

in the front part of the cap with a hook (9)
placed approximately near the perimetrical

edge of said body and projecting from the base
surface of said main body, suitable for cooperating

with a corresponding projection of a
cover;
a cover (20) connected with said main body (2)
by means of an elastic hinge (11), said cover

having a hollow cylindrical element (21) housing
the cylindrical part (12) of said main body,

when said cover is closed, and having, in its
inside edge, a hook-shaped projection (10)

cooperating with the corresponding hook (9) of
the main body,
characterized in that
 said main body (2) presents
a hole (8) in the base surface in correspondence

with where the hook (9) is fixed and under said
hook, through which hole (8) a part of the mould

male moving in the direction of the axis of said main
body can pass during the moulding of the cap with

thermoplastic material, and
that
 the main body has a ring-projection (7)
between the first outer wall (3) and the second

cylindrical wall (6), said projection (7) matching the
upper surface (51) of the edge of the container and radially inside of said hole (8) in

order to seal the cap against the edge of the container.
Cap according to claim 1), 
characterized in that

the main body (2) and the cover (20) are carried out
in a single piece by means of moulding of thermoplastic

material.
Cap according to each one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the upper surface (22) of the
cover (20) proximate to the hinge is concave and its

concave part faces outwards, said surface being
part of a cylindrical surface of a cylinder, the main

axis of which is perpendicular to the cap axis.
