<ABSTRACT>
A cell(15) storing a sample prepared by adsorbing an 
immunocomplex which is formed by antigen-antibody 

reaction on a surface of a noble metal colloid such as a 
gold colloid as an immunity test material is irradiated 

with excitation light from a light source(1) by an 
optical system(10). Raman scattering light generated 

from the sample is guided to and detected by a spectral 
detector(30) through an optical system(20). A signal 

processing arithmetic unit(50) corrects the Raman 
scattering light which is detected by the spectral 

detector(30) with an output of the detector(26) 
indicating intensity of the light source for obtaining a 

Raman spectrum, thereby identifying or determining a 
measuring object material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for immunologically analyzing a measuring
object in the field of clinical testing, biochemical
sample measurement, drug quality control or the like.Immunological analysis methods employing antigenantibody
reaction include fluorescent immunoassay and
luminescent immunoassay. These methods are adapted to
competitively react an antigen, which is labeled with a
fluorescent material or a chemiluminescent material, with
a measuring object antigen with respect to an antibody
for measuring fluorescence or luminescence from the label
of an antigen-antibody reacted immunocomplex, thereby
quantitatively analyzing the measuring object material.A method of adding an antigen or an antibody of a
measuring object material to an antibody or an antigen
and measuring light absorption or scattering by an 
immunocomplex which is formed by antigen-antibody
reaction thereby making quantitative analysis is known as
an optical measuring method utilizing neither
fluorescence nor luminescence. Quantitative analysis
methods employing light scattering include turbidimetry
and nephelometry, which are adapted to measure
transmitted light attenuated by absorption and scattering
and to measure intensity of scattered light respectively.The method employing light scattering measures
Rayleigh or Mie scattering, in response to sizes of
particles as measured. No wavelength shifting is caused
in Rayleigh or Mie scattering, and scattering intensity
at an excitation light wavelength is measured.On the other hand, surface-sensitized Raman
spectrometry is employed as a method of measuring
vibration spectra of molecules. This method utilizes
such a phenomenon that strong Raman scattering is caused
when a material is adsorbed on the surface of a noble
metal electrode or colloid of gold or silver (refer to
"Bunseki", 1993, pp. 577 - 585, for example). Protein,
bilirubin and the like are studied through such surface-sensitized
Raman spectrometry. It is known that
vibration spectra are enhanced to 107 to 108 times upon
occurrence of surface-sensitized Raman scattering, to
allow measurement of high sensitivity. However, fluorescent or luminescent immunoassay
requires complicated chemical treatment for labelling an
antigen or an antibody with a fluorescent or
chemiluminescent material. In general, further, such
immunoassay is a heterogeneous immunoassay, which requires
a B-F separating operation for separating an antigen-antibody
reacted immunocomplex (B) from a nonreacted
antigen (F) and a
