<ABSTRACT>
Device for the washing and dewatering a fibrous
suspension, which device incorporates two hollow, circular

cylindrical filter drums (1), which filter drums
incorporate evacuation chambers inside the filter drums for

evacuation of fluid. The filter drums rotate in opposite
directions to create a pinch (2) where at least one of the

said filter drums (1) is installed in a trough (7,8) which
partly encloses the outer surface (3) of the filter drum

and which, in the direction of rotation of the filter drum,
converges towards the outer surface of the filter drum. At

least one pulp inflow chamber (4) is installed at the
highest point (1) of one or both of the filter drums each

equipped with a trough for the introduction of pulp between
the outer surfaces (3) of the filter drum and its trough

(7,8) for the formation of a fibrous web. The trough (7,8)
is designed to enclose the outer surface (3) of the filter

drum, from the inflow chamber (4) and further round at
least 230° of the circumference of the outer surface, so

that the said fibrous web during operation is constrained
to run between the filter drum's outer surface (3) and the

trough (7,8) round at least 230° of the circumference of
the outer surface before the fibrous web reaches the pinch

(2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device according to the
preamble to Claim 1.In the production of pulp from cellulose containing
fibrous materials there are one or several points in the
process where there is a need to wash and de-water the
pulp.A known and habitually used device for the washing
and dewatering of pulp is disclosed in SE-C-380 300 (= US-A-3980518). A similar wash press is shown in US-A-3772144. The
device shown therein utilizes two cylindrical, rotatable
filter drums arranged in an essentially converging trough,
which however is partly diverging at the inlet for the wash
fluid. Characteristic of this existing type of device, as
shown in SE-C-380 300, is that the trough normally extends
round only about 180° of the filter drum's circumference,
even if Figure 1 in the description shows a gap for the
pulp between the filter drum and the trough (not shown),
which seem to extend somewhat further over the filter
drum's circumference. This implies that effective
dewatering of the pulp can only be achieved under a
relatively limited sector of the filter drum's
circumference, since effective dewatering only takes place
where the pulp is pressed by the trough walls against the
filter drum.SE-C-501 710 seems to disclose a further
development of the device in SE-C-380 300, and deals
principally with the sealing aspect. The same applicant
also has US 5,488,900 and SE-C-504 011, in which the US
patent discloses a device with pulp inflow arranged at the
bottom, whereas the Swedish patent discloses a simplified
arrangement, which is not designed to wash the pulp and
which gives a relatively low dryness of the out flowing
pulp, where it is also is said that a certain re-wetting of
the dewatered pulp flow is inevitable. Other examples of known devices are disclosed in US
4,543,161 and US 5,667,642 in which the latter shows a
device where the drum rotates in the opposite direction to
that conventionally used, i.e. seen from the end face the
right drum rotates anticlockwise and the left clockwise.For wash presses with only one filter drum it is
known to arrange a trough which extends round a larger
sector of the filter drum's circumference and which thereby
provides a longer effective dewatering zone. See for
example US 4,986,881 where however cleaning means to flush
away remaining fibre residues on the filter drum is
missing. US 4,085,003 and US 5,046,338 also show
embodiments with only one filter drum.In SE-C-318 182 (CA,A,862450) a wash press is shown
with one hollow filter drum (Figures 1 and 2) and

Device for the washing and dewatering of a fibrous
suspension, which device incorporates two circular

cylindrical filter drums (1) arranged to rotate in opposite
directions to create a pinch (2) and installed with their

axes of rotation in essentially one and the same horizontal
plane, in which both of the said filter drums are hollow and

are equipped with evacuation chambers (22) and allow
evacuation of fluid radially inwards into the filter drum,

in which at least one of the hollow filter drums (1) is installed
