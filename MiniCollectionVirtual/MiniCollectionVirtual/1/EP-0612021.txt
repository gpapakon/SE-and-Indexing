A method for the assignment of levels to nodes in a net diagram by 
detecting loops in the diagram, determining disconnection portions of 

each loop by determining the maximum overlap of the loops and 
sequentially determining the levels to be assigned.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
automatically drawing net diagrams including a logic
diagram, a process diagram, a relational tree diagram, a
layout of a printed circuit board, and in particular, to a
schematic generating method of automatically generating
net diagram or logic circuit diagram and a schematic
generator or system using the method suitable for
generating a logic diagram, a functional diagram, or a
circuit diagram in which signal flows are easily traceable
based on circuit parts such as circuit elements and
constituent circuits and connective information about
connections therebetween.For the conventional schematic generator,
various proposals have been presented. For example,
articles of such proposals have been described in the
JP-A-61-204775, "A Method of Generating a Logic Diagram"
in the Technical Report CAS84-134 published in 1984 from
the Institute or Electronics and Communication Engineers
of Japan, "A visibility-oriented Construction System for Logic Diagrams", Systems
and Computers in Japan, Vol 17, No 7, published in 1986, ad JP-A-60-205672,
and the JP-A-60-176177.In an ordinary schematic generator, a entire logic circuit is subdivided
through a logic division such that for each subdivided portion, arrangement of
diagram drawing symbols of respective circuit parts and the like are determined in
the subdivided constituent circuit 
through an automatic placement or placement. Routings
between the circuit parts are determined through an
automatic routing. In another ordinary schematic
generator, the circuit parts are arranged so as to be
thereafter divided, thereby generating a logic circuit
diagram. These methods produces a clear diagram primarily
by subdividing a logic circuit diagram in an effective
fashion, by employing a hierarchic representation of the
logic circuit diagram, or by using properties of
particular circuit parts other than the connective
relationships between the circuit parts.Moreover, conventionally, according to a method
of arranging circuit parts of a logical circuit diagram in
the schematic generating method, locations in which
drawing symbols are allocatable are limited to positions
defined by assuming a checkerboard or grid on the
objective diagram. The placements are then sequentially
determined beginning from an end of the diagram in a fixed
direction (for example, from an output side to an input
side or in a reverse direction thereto) according to the
connective relationships between the drawings symbols
(namely, between the circuit parts).

<CLAIMS>
A method of automatically assigning levels to nodes in a directed graph
based diagram representing a technical system, the diagram having nodes and

arcs, said method comprising:

a first step (62, 63) of detecting loops in said diagram and producing
loop information, each loop being a closed path and having sequentially

connected nodes and arcs, the start node and end node of said closed path
being the same node,
a second step (67 to 69) of processing to assign levels to nodes in loops
based on said loop information, and
a third step (64, 65, 70, 71, 72) of sequentially determining levels for
the nodes of said diagram;
said method being characterized in that said second step includes
detecting (67), by using said loop information an arc or arcs belonging
to the maximum numbers of loops, and
determining (68) a feedback arc from among said arcs and removing
said feedback arc from all said loops.
A method according to Claim 1, wherein said second step further
includes detecting (67) a plurality of arcs belonging to the maximum number of

loops by using said loop information, and determining (68) a feedback arc from
among said plurality of arcs by any one or any combination of a plurality of

selection rules.
A method according to Claim 2, wherein the determining step comprises
determining (68) a feedback arc from among said plurality of arcs by any one

or any combination of the following first to third selection rules,

a first selection rule of preferentially selecting one of said plurality of
arcs that is associated with the smallest number of non-levelled nodes

positioned at start points of arcs having end points in common with said
selected one arc, a non levelled node being a node not assigned with its level,
a second selection rule of preferentially selecting one of said plurality of
arcs that is associated with the greatest number of levelled nodes positioned at

start points of arcs having end points in common with said selected one arc,
each levelled node being a node already assigned with its level,
a third selection rule of preferentially selecting one of said plurality of
arcs that is associated with the smallest value of maximum levels of levelled

nodes positioned at start points of arcs having end points in common with said 
selected one arc.
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein said first step
(62, 63) includes extracting (63) loops each including only two nodes, and

processing to set said two nodes to the same level.
