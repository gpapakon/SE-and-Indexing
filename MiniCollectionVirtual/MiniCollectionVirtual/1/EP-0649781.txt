<ABSTRACT>
An electronic brake control system which is free of 
any change in the brake operation feelings during 

electronic control or even if the electronic control 
function should break down and which can assure braking 

forces even if the electronic control function should be 
lost. Wheel brakes (8) for the front vehicle wheels are 

connected to static pressure brake lines (A1,A2) leading to a 
tandem master cylinder (1). Wheel brakes (9) for the rear wheels 

are connected to dynamic pressure brake lines (B1,B2). To the 
dynamic pressure lines (B1,B2) is supplied a fluid pressure 

generated in a high fluid pressure generator (5) after adjusted 
by an electronically controlled pressure control valve (6). An 

electronic control unit (7) receives the signals from a brake 
operation detector (3) and a vehicle deceleration sensor (4) and 

outputs driving signals to the pressure control valve (6) to 
control braking forces so that a predetermined relation is 

maintained between the output of the detector (3) and that of 
the sensor (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a brake system for a 
vehicle which operates safely even if its electronic 
control system should fail and which eliminates any 
significant change in the brake pedal feeling while the 
braking force is being electronically controlled. ABS and TCS are known as typical electronic control 
systems in which the brake fluid pressure is controlled 
electronically. In some of such conventional brake 
systems, the stroke of the brake pedal is detected and the 
brake fluid from a dynamic pressure source is, after its 
pressure has been adjusted by means of an electronically 
controlled pressure control valve, introduced into a static 
pressure line which utilizes the master cylinder as its 
pressure source, to produce a brake fluid pressure 
corresponding to the stroke of the brake pedal (one of such 
systems is disclosed in Unexamined Japanese Patent 
Publication 59-220441 filed by the present applicant). Many of such conventional electronic brake systems 
have a problem in that the brake pedal feeling changes 
during electronic control or if the system should fail. 
For example, the brake pedal can vibrate, be pushed back or 
get locked at a given point, or the driver may feel 
fluctuations in the force that counteracts the force  
 
applied to the pedal by the driver. There is also known a brake system of the type in 
which, instead of controlling the static pressure 
generating means such as a master cylinder directly by 
means of the brake pedal, the control of the brake fluid 
pressure is carried out solely by electronically 
controlling the pressure from the dynamic pressure source 
according to the detected brake pedal stroke. This system 
is known by the name of "brake-by-wire". This system is 
free of changing pedal feelings. But instead, it has a 
problem in that the braking function is totally lost, 
should the electronic control function fail. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a brake system which is free of any change in the 
brake pedal feeling during electronically controlled 
braking and which ensures a high level of safety even if 
the electronic control function should fail. In order to achieve this object, according to the 
present invention, there is provided a brake system for a 
vehicle comprising: wheel brakes each mounted on vehicle 
wheels; at least two mutually independent static pressure 
brake lines; a master cylinder for supplying fluid 
pressures to the at least two mutually independent static 
pressure brake lines; braking
