A process for producing chloroprene by means of 
the dehydrochlorination of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene is 

disclosed, which is characterized in that the 
dehydrochlorination is carried out in the presence of 

lime and a primary amine having the general formula R-NH₂, 
in which R is a monofunctional C₁-C₁₅ hydrocarbyl 

radical selected from linear or branched alkyl, 
alkylaryl, cyclohexyl, alkylcyclohexyl, cyclopentyl,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparing chloroprene by dehydrochlorinating 3,4-dichloro-1-butene. It is well known that the main process for 
preparing chloroprene, i.e., 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene, 
consists in dehydrochlorinating 3,4-dichloro-1-butene 
(DCB) by means of sodium hydroxide. Sodium hydroxide 
is consumed in stoichiometric amounts and, 
consequently, its cost largely contributes to increase 
the process costs. Therefore, the prior art tried to find out 
solutions which would be less burdensome than sodium 
hydroxide use. In particular, investigations are in 
course into the possibility of replacing sodium 
hydroxide with lime, which is cheaper. The problem 
which arises in this case is the low reactivity of 
lime. Some DCB dehydrochlorination processes which use 
lime as the basic material, are disclosed in patent 
literature. So, e.g., JP-51/43705 discloses a system which is 
constituted by sodium, calcium hydroxide and sulfate. 
Said process is schematically represented by the 
equation: 
2CH2=CH-CHCl-CH2Cl + Ca(OH)2 + Na2SO4 → 
2CH2=CH-C(Cl)=CH2 + CaSO4 + 2NaCl + 2H2OThe main drawback displayed by this process 
consists in the production of two byproducts, and  
 
namely, calcium sulfate and sodium chloride. In particular, CaSO4, which is insoluble in water, 
must be separated from the aqueous, sodium chloride 
containing solution. This operation implies self-explanatory 
increases in overall process costs. 
Furthermore, the process disclosed in that patent does 
not make it possible a quantitative conversion to be 
reached. Other processes for DCB dehydrochlorination in 
the presence of ammonia or amines are reported in the 
literature.  
 GB-A-1,173,359 discloses a process for preparing an unsaturated aliphatic 
compound, comprising dehydrohalogenating a halogenated aliphatic 
compound containing at least two carbon atoms with an inorganic alkaline 
material in an aqueous medium in the presence of a quaternary ammonium 
compound, while EP-A-0010676 discloses the use of a mixture of lime and a 
primary amine as dehydrochlorination agent.  
 FR-A-2,266,681 discloses a process of 
dehydrochlorination in the presence of ammonia. The 
selectivity to CP is high, but the conversion rate is 
rather poor. The process requires the presence of such 
a polar solvent as N,N-dimethylformamide and, 
furthermore, a recycle of ammonia is not provided for. JP-A-51/54504 discloses a process which makes it 
possible satisfactory selectivity values to be 
reached, but which requires that
