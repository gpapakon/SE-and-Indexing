<ABSTRACT>
In ATM communications, a plurality of communications are normally transmitted through common link sections. Optionally, new incoming communications are allowed on the basis of decisions made by acceptance algorithms. However, only yes/no decisions are made. It is nevertheless desirable that the reserved band width at a given moment be known. This problem is solved by the invention whereby the band width is evaluated by steps while communications are being set up/switched out.
