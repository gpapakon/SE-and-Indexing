<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing apparatus, and more particularly to the
encryption of image data.Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a configuration
of a prior art image encoding apparatus having an
encryption function.Fig. 2 shows a block diagram of an image
decoding apparatus for decoding the image data encoded
by the apparatus of Fig. 1.In the encoding apparatus shown in Fig. 1,
numeral 110 denotes a high resolution analog video
signal (hereinafter referred to as an HD signal), which,
in the present example, has the number of scan lines of
1,050 and a frame frequency of 30 Hz. Relative to the
HD signal, a video signal of an ordinary resolution
having the number of scan lines of 525, a frame
frequency of 30 Hz and the number of pixels of 858 is
referred to as an SD signal.An HD A/D conversion circuit 112 samples the
video signal 110 at a sampling frequency of 54.054 MHz
to convert it to a digital signal. By virtue of the
sampling frequency, the number of pixels per line of 
the digital HD signal is 1,716. A high resolution
(HD)/ordinary resolution (SD) conversion circuit 114
reduces the number of pixels to one half in both
vertical direction and horizontal direction to output
a video signal of the ordinary resolution having the
number of scan lines of 525, the frame frequency of 30
Hz and the number of pixels per line of 858.An encoding circuit 116 efficiently encodes the
digital SD signal outputted from the conversion circuit
114 by an encoding scheme which is a combination of
motion compensated adaptive prediction and DCT. A
decoding circuit 118 decodes the encoded signal
outputted from the decoded circuit 116 to reproduce an
SD signal. An SD/HD conversion signal 120 interpolates
pixels to the output video data from the decoding
circuit 118 by a factor of two in both vertical
direction and horizontal direction to convert it to an
HD signal. Namely, the SD/HD conversion circuit 120
outputs a signal corresponding to the high resolution
video signal having the number of scan lines of 1,050,
the number of pixels per line of 1,716 and the frame
frequency of 30 Hz.A subtractor 122 subtracts the output of the
SD/HD conversion circuit 120 from the output of the
A/D conversion circuit 112 for each pixel. The output
of the subtractor 122 is referred to as an auxiliary
video signal. An encoding circuit 124 encodes the 
output of the subtractor 122 in the same encoding
scheme as that for the encoding circuit 116.A multiplexing circuit 126 multiplexes the
encoded data (the encoded SD signal)
