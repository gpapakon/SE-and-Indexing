<ABSTRACT>
An outboard motor body case is supported on a swivel 
shaft through a connecting member. The swivel shaft 

vertically swingable about a tilting shaft. An engine is 
mounted at an upper portion of the outboard motor body 

case, with a crankshaft thereof being directed vertically, 
and a flywheel is mounted at a lower end of the 

crankshaft and disposed between an engine block and the 
connecting member. A dynamo is mounted within the 

flywheel, and a starter motor is engaged with a ring gear 
which is formed around an outer periphery of the flywheel. 

Thus, since the flywheel having a large weight is mounted 
at the lower end of the crankshaft, the position of the 

gravity center of the outboard motor is lowered. 
Therefore, it is possible to easily perform a tilting-up 

about the tilting shaft with a small force. Moreover, 
since the flywheel is mounted on a power taking-off side 

of the crankshaft, the torsional vibration of the 
crankshaft can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an outboard motor with the features
according to the preamble part of claim 1.Such outboard motors are detachably mounted at the stern for
use to propel a boat or ship.Such outboard motor is known from US-A-2,357,942 comprising an
3-cylinder engine with star configuration. JP-A-62 267 561
shows an multiple cylinder V-type engine of such outboard
motor.In a common type of the prior art outboard motor, an
engine (a vertical engine) having a flywheel provided at
an upper end of a vertically directed crankshaft
protruding from an engine block is mounted in an outboard
motor body case which is mounted to boat body through an
antivibration mount. Such types of the outboard motors
are disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open Nos.191610/87, 192917/88 and
192918/88.In these outboard motors, a ring gear is mounted
around an outer periphery of the flywheel, and a starter
motor is mounted above a side of the engine and meshed
with the ring gear. A driving pulley of a valve-operating
wrapping type transmission is provided
at an end of the crankshaft adjacent and below the flywheel.In usual, an igniting power source coil and a 
charging power source coil are accommodated in the
flywheel to constitute a dynamo and hence, the flywheel
is of a downwardly-turned bowl-like shape.In such prior art outboard motor, the heavy flywheel
having a large inertial moment, which largely influences
the determination of the gravity center position of the
engine, is farther spaced upwardly from the antivibration
mount. And the crankshaft end opposite from the flywheel
is coupled to a driving shaft for transmitting a driving
force to a propeller. Therefore, factors of a torsional
vibration are increased to exert not a little influence
to the selection of the antivibration mount and hence,
the selection of the antivibration mount must be taken
into special consideration.In addition, not only the flywheel but also a
starter must be mounted above the engine. Therefore, the
gravity center position of the engine becomes high, which
increases the moment required during tilting-up of the
outboard motor, and also limits the freedom of the
disposition of other auxiliaries, especially, the
disposition of an electric equipment box for
accommodating a CDI unit and a plurality of coils, other
auxiliaries such as intake system auxiliaries or the
like, in the case of a multi-cylinder (3 or more) engine.Further, in a 4-cycle engine used in the outboard motor,
the driving pulley of the wrapping type
