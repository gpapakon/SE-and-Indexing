<ABSTRACT>
In order to develop a method for controlling the temperature and the humidity of air in rooms by means of an air conditioning installation to the effect that universal optimisation is possible given various stipulated target functions, the process characteristic (process cycle) is determined such that   a) a selected target function is fulfilled, it being optionally possible to fix the scale of evaluation differently for each individual unit, b) boundary conditions, which limit the states of the air upon exit from the individual units with respect to relevant quantities, and which restrict the use of units with respect to characteristic quantities, are prescribed, c) the technically physically realisable changes in state in the individual units are determined, d) the overall process characteristic is realised by juxtaposing the changes in state in the individual units, and after the target function has been reached the control results are fixed, by giving the parameters of state of the air relative to the respective unit, in such a way that e) thereafter the operation of each unit can be controlled or regulated individually or in a fashion combined into groups, in which latter case the optimised air exit parameters can be used as desired values.

Process for the regulation of temperature and humidity 
of air in rooms with the aid of a ventilation and air conditioning 

system which is comprised of a plurality of 
individual units for effecting air condition changes 

and which uses outside air and outgoing air as entry 
flows, in which case the control of the individual air 

conditioning units and the conduction of the process 
are effected in such a way that the supply air brings 

about a predetermined room air condition, whereby an 
objective function is fulfilled, viz. that the target 

condition is reached with a minimum of energy expenditure 
and in which marginal conditions with regard to 

the the air conditions adjustable by means of individual 
units are preset and the realizable condition 

changes are determined,
 
characterized in that
 
the process conduction is determined in such a way 


a) that at certain selectable time intervals, the respective 
operating parameters of the system meeting 

the objective function are determined by computation, 
in that the condition field of the air passed 

through the individual units is discretisized by 
the division into temperature and humidity sections 

(delta t and delta x) so that, setting out from the 
condition of the outside air, a finite number of 

(while taking the marginal conditions into account) 
theoretically possible ways up to the room air or 

supply air condition results and each of these ways 
is pursued in a stepwise fashion, in which case, 

for each way, the evaluations of the air treatment 
by the individual units are added up with regard 

to the objective function and, finally, the parameters 
of that way are selected for the operation 

of the individual units, whose summed overall evaluation 
fulfills the objective function
;  
 
b) in that, as objective function, the "minimization 
of the exergonic, environment-relevant, calorific 

or cost-wise assessed energy expenditures" or the 
"minimization of directly employed nature resources" 

is predetermined, while the evaluation standard for 
each individual unit can also be assessed variably; 
c) in that, as marginal conditions, the air conditions 
at the outlets of the individual units with regard 

to the temperature, the absolute humidity, the specific 
enthalpy and the dew point temperature - 

specifically related to a constant air pressure, 
which may be different for each individual unit - 

or of values derived therefrom, are used as well as 
limitations of the unit employment with regard to 

the air throughput, of the flow parameters on the 
part of the heating or cooling media, the output, 

the condition values of the air to be processed 
or of unit-specific characteristica, are predetermined; 
d) in that the technically-physically realizable condition 
changes in the individual units - while setting 

out from the occurring supply air conditions discretisized 
according to temperature and humidity - 

are examined in parameter steps characteristic of 
the unit (temperature increases, increases in humidity, 

lowering of cooling water entry temperatures, 
etc.), in which case, for non-regulated units, 

the examination comprises solely a single step, 
with the first result of the air exit condition 

which, after the use of a rounding algorithm - is 
available once more in a discretisized form and the 

second result of a summand for the overall evaluation 
in line with the objective function, in which  

 
case,in the event that several parameter steps produce 

the same discretisized air exit condition, the 
step which, in line with the target function, reaches 

the most favourable (smallest or largest) summand, 
enters into the evaluations, and 
e) in that, accordingly, the operation of every unit, 
individually or combined into groups, can be controlled 

or regulated, while in the latter case the 
optimized air exit parameters can be employed as 

nominal values. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
in lieu of the predetermined room air condition, an 

air condition defined by the parameters of the entry 
air flowsor, with regard to temperature and humidity, 

a defined room air condition range, whose limitations, 
both in dependence of the internal heat and humidity 

burdens - detectable from the air conditions measured 
during the operation of the system for the outgoing 

air and the supply air (delta h/delta x, room), the 
number of persons in the room and/or of the electrical 

devices being operated in the room - as well as the 
external meteorological conditions and also the utilization 

time, are predeterminable, in which case the 
discretisized temperature and humidity sections (delta 

t and delta x), whose area centers are located within 
the defined range, are equivalent amongst themselves. 
Process according to either Claim 1 or Claim 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the optimal process conduction also includeas an optimization 

of the air throughput, in which case higienically, 
air conduction-technically and/or constructionally-physically 

caused limitations are predeterminable.  
 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
 
wherein the room air conditioning system comprises a 

plurality of individual units, viz. at least one heating 
unit (EH), one cooling unit (KU) and one humidification 

unit (WA) and possesses the sensor which supplies 
the relevant air conditions (pressure (p), temperature 

(t), humidity (x) and/or also other air condition 
values) of the outside air, the outgoing air and 

the supply air, in which case, on the strength of optimization 
results detected on the lines of the objective 

function while taking into consideration the room 
air-technical and unit-specific marginal conditions, 

all units or part combinations are operated by units, 
with the aid of which the room target condition range 

(t TARGET min...t TARGET max, x TARGET min ... x TARGET 
max, phi TARGET min ... phi TARGET max, tau TARGET min 

... tau TARGET max) is attainable,
 
characterized in that 


a) while taking into account the predetermined, stored 
marginal conditions all temperature changes and/or 

changes in humidity possible with the individual 
units in i temperature sections delta t ≤ 1 K and 

in j humidity sections delta x ≤ 1g/kg are viewed 
and the object function sum K is determined, in 

which case, as point of departure, the outside air 
condition (tAU, xAU) with K = 0 is valid; 
b) in that all technically possible air conditions 
after each unit in a t, x stage field e are characterized 

by the minimum expenditure (e,i,j) necessary 
up to this condition point in line with the objective 

function;  
 
c) in that only the K min (e,i,j) ≥ 0 can be point of 
departure for the condition change in the next unit; 
d) in that the condition change in the room, preferably 
divided into the residence area and an upper area, 

is regarded technically-physically as the condition 
change in a unit, but that no additive is added to 

the object function sum; 
e) in that the condition points t (e,i), x (e,j) occupied 
by K min (e,i,j) ≥, which are located within 

the room target range, while taking into consideration 
all marginal conditions, constitute the technically 

possible room air conditions which are achievable 
in the air conditioning process; 
f) in that the optimal ventilation process along the 
lines of the objective function within the room 

residence area leads through the condition point 
possessing the lowest occupied K min (e,i,j) value; 
g) in that the optimization of the ventilation process 
is repeated at regular intervals, while this takes 

place at predetermined time intervals or in dependence 
of the measured, by preference time-related 

changes in the air condition of the entry values 
(outside air, outgoing air and/or supply air). 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 4,
 
characterized in that
 
the unit-specific marginal conditions and technically 

feasible condition changes, while setting out from 
the predetermination values while using the actually 

mwasured air condition change, are automatically changed 
and stored after a predetermined approximation operation.
