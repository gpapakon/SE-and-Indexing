<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment of effluents produced during the incineration of industrial and/or domestic waste, and the product originating from this process. According to the process the acidic gases present in the fumes (6) produced by the incineration of the waste are neutralised in a reactor (7) with an unsaturated basic solution, the gaseous heavy metals present in the fumes are condensed and adsorbed on solid particles entrained by the gaseous flow of the said fumes, and then these particles are filtered off and separated from the gaseous phase in a dust precipitator (9). These solid particles, consisting of the products of the neutralisation reactions of the acidic gases, of the excess reactant and of the fly ash, are then conveyed to a washing (10) or vitrification (13) plant. This process applies to the treatment of industrial and/or domestic waste and makes it possible to obtain a solid residue free from soluble pollutants and presenting no danger to the natural environment.

Process for treating effluents from house and/or industrial waste
incinerating installations, of the type consisting in :


neutralizing the acid gases, contained in the hot fumes produced by
incinerating said waste, by contacting, in a reactor, the fumes with an

alkaline metal carbonate,
condensing and absorbing the heavy metals, contained in said hot fumes,
on the particles driven in the gaseous stream of these fumes,
then separating by filtration said solid particles from the gaseous phase,
said solid particles being formed by products of the neutralization reactions

of the acid gases, the excess reagent, and the flying ashes,
characterized in that :
said acid gases contained in said hot fumes are neutralized by an unsaturated
basic solution of said alkaline metal carbonate sprayed and

injected at the same time as said hot fumes in the reactor (7), whereby the
water of said un-saturated basic solution of an alkaline metal carbonate is

rapidly evaporated, and the alkaline metal carbonate is cristallized into very
small particles, of a size of about one micrometre,

and in that :
the mixture (M) of the products of the neutralization reactions of the
acid gases, excess reagent and flying ashes is either washed, for

obtaining a solid that is free from polluting soluble salts, or melted, then
cooled for obtaining a vitrified solid in which the polluting substances

are trapped.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the un-saturated
basic solution is a solution of sodium carbonate.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the sodium
carbonate solution is at a concentration in sodium carbonate which is

comprised between about 20 g/l and about 200 g/l.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the sodium
carbonate solution is at a concentration in sodium carbonate which is

comprised between about 50 g/l and about 150 g/l.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the sodium
carbonate solution is at a concentration in sodium carbonate of about

100 g/l.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that, for neutralizing the acid gases, there is used a small excess of sodium

carbonate with respect to the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction of
the acid gases.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that, in case the mixture
(M) is washed, water from the washing of the mixture (M) is evaporated for

obtaining cristallization of the salts previously dissolved in this water.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that, in case the mixture (M) is washed, water from the washing of the

mixture (M) is partially recycled for preparing the sodium carbonate
solution which is used for neutralizing the acid gases.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that, in case the mixture (M) is melted, melting is made without addition of

low melting point fluxing agent. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that, in case the mixture (M) is melted, the melting temperature is lower

than about 1,100Â°C.
Washed or vitrified product obtained by the process according to one
of the preceding claims.
