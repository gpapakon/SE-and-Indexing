An anthracene derivative having at least two 
groups of the formula: 


wherein R¹ and R² are independently hydrogen, alkyl, 
alkoxy, etc., is particular effective for forming an

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an anthracene 
derivative usable as a material for semiconductors, an 
intermediate for medicines, an intermediate for dyes 
and a functional material for optical recording 
materials, etc., and particularly useful as a material 
for producing an antireflection coating in the field of 
semiconductors. Chemically amplified resist materials are now 
studied for applying to fine pattern formation using 
deep ultraviolet light (300 nm or less), such as KrF 
excimer laser beams (248.4 nm). But when these resist 
materials are used for highly reflective substrates 
such as aluminum wired substrates, there arise strong 
influences by in-layer multiple reflection caused by 
reflection of exposing light from semiconductor 
substrates due to high transmittivity of the resist 
materials for deep ultraviolet light, etc. When film 
thickness of resists is changed remarkably by level 
difference, etc. caused by the influences of in-layer 
multiple reflection, resist pattern dimension changes 
greatly, resulting in causing a problem of disconnection, 
and the like. In order to prevent the in-layer 
multiple reflection, the formation of an antireflection 
coating on a semiconductor substrate is now studying.  
 
But no suitable materials usable as antireflection 
coating for deep ultraviolet light such as KrF excimer 
laser beams are found yet. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an anthracene derivative usable as an intermediate 
for medicines, dyes, etc., a material for 
optical recording materials and semiconductors, 
particularly as a material for forming an antireflection 
coating on a surface of a semiconductor substrate 
in order to prevent influences of the in-layer multiple 
reflection at the time of resist pattern formation by 
lithograph using deep ultraviolet light such as KrF 
excimer laser beams and to satisfy the recent demand. The present invention provides an anthracene 
derivative of the formula: 
 
wherein R1 and R2 are independently a hydrogen atom, an 
alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a halogen atom or a 
hydroxyl group; R3, R4, R5 and R6 are independently a 
hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an alkoxy group, a 
halogen atom, or a group of the formula:  
 
 
wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, provided that at 
least one of R3 through R6 is the group of the formula 
[II], and the group of the formula [II] in number of 3 
cannot be positioned at the 1, 8 and 9 positions of the 
anthracene ring at the same time. Fig. 1 shows a ultraviolet spectroscopic 
curve
