<ABSTRACT>
A composite material has an open cellular core, whose cells are closed with foam. The faces of the core are covered with a barrier fabric and fibres impregnated in a polymerized resin that adheres to the core. An Independent claim is included for manufacturing a composite material as above includes assembling in a mould a cellular core covered in turn with a fireproof film, a dry barrier fabric, dry fibres. The mould is closed. Heat and pressure is applied to the assembly so the film polymerizes and expands to close off the cells without impregnating the barrier fabric. Resin is injected into the mould under vacuum to impregnate the barrier fabric and dry fibres. The resin is polymerized and the mould opened.

Method of manufacturing a sandwich panel made of composite material,

characterized in that
 it comprises the following steps:

placing, in a mould, an assembly comprising an open cell core (10), a film
(12) of intumescent material covering each of the faces of the core, a dry

barrier fabric (14) covering each of the films and an overlay (16) of dry
fibres covering each of the barrier fabrics, said barrier fabrics being

sealed against a foam (12a) capable of being provided during the
polymerization of said films (12) and which can be wetted by a resin capable

of being injected into the mould;
closing the mould;
pressurizing and heating the mould according to a cycle for the expansion
and polymerization of the intumescent material (12), in a way that forms said

foam (12), closing off the cells of the core (10) on each of its faces,
without impregnating the dry barrier fabrics (14);
evacuating the mould and injecting said resin into it in a manner that
impregnates the overlays (16) of dry fibres and the dry barrier fabrics (14);
carrying out a cycle for polymerization of the resin;
stripping the panel obtained from the mould.
Method according to claim 1, in which films (12) are used of a thickness
such that after polymerization, said foam (12a) only fills the parts of the

cells of the core (10) which are close to the faces of the core.
Method according to claim 2, in which films (12) are used which have a
thickness of about 2.5 mm.
Method according to any one of the preceding claims, in which barrier
fabrics (14) made of calendered polyamide are used.
Sandwich panel made of a composite material comprising an open cell core
(10) sealed by a foam (10a) and skins covering both faces of the core, said

skins being formed of fibres and resin, and comprising a polymerized resin-impregnated
fibre overlay (16a), the cells of the core (10) being sealed by a

foam (12a) on each of its faces, 
characterized in that
 each of the skins
comprises, between the core of the panel and the fibre overlay (16a), a

barrier fabric (14a) tight to said foam (12a) and wettable by the resin, the
fibre overlay (16a) and the barrier fabric (14a) both being impregnated with

one and the same resin polymerized and stuck onto the core of the panel.
Panel according to claim 5, in which said foam (12a) only fills the parts
of the cells of the core (10) which are close to the faces of the core. 
Panel according to either of the claims 5 and 6, in which the barrier
fabrics are produced in calendered polyamide.
