<ABSTRACT>
Blends of vinylidene fluoride copolymer having a melting 
temperature below about 

160°C with at least one compatible resin and up to 35 parts pigment(s) 
per 100 parts by weight of the resin components are used to prepare 

high-gloss pigmented powder coating products. Also mentioned is the 
use of polyvinylidene fluoride copolymers having a melting point below 

about 160°C as a gloss enhancing film former in pigmented powder 
coatings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pigmented powder coating products,
based on vinylidene fluoride copolymers (hereinafter referred to as VdFC),
for preparing high-gloss fluorinated coatings and to a process for coating
a substrate with a high-gloss pigmented VdFC powder coating. In
particular, the present invention relates to the use of vinylidene fluoride
copolymers in pigmented powder coating products, for obtaining high-gloss
VdFC-based protective coatings.Coatings based on vinylidene fluoride homopolymers (hereinafter PVdF)
are known to be very useful as protective coatings for a variety of
substrates due to the good chemical and weathering resistance and to the
thermal stability of PVdF. The general known technique used for preparing
them is to prepare a dispersion of PVdF in a suitable solvent for
application by known means onto the required substrate which is thereafter
subjected to a heat treatment.The solvent used is generally known in the prior art as "latent
solvent", and it is described therein as an organic solvent which has no
significant action on PVdF at room temperature but which at an elevated
temperature exerts a sufficient solvent action.However, although the known systems may give good results,
environmental protection laws throughout the world, but mainly in Europe
and in the U.S.A., are making it increasingly difficult to handle
solvent-based systems. Further, the recovery of the solvent is a costly
procedure. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for solventless
PVdF-based coatings. GB-2194539-A to Labofina discloses pigmented
PVdF-based powder coating products essentially consisting of vinylidene
fluoride homopolymer (or copolymer with at most 10 wt% of comonomer units),
one or more compatible thermoplastic resin and one or more pigments. It
also discloses a process for preparing the products. However, the initial
gloss obtained is not very high.EP-456018-A to Elf Atochem North America discloses pigmented powder
coatings of vinylidene fluoride/hexafluoropropylene copolymers, the resin
component comprising 50-90 wt% of said copolymers having a melt viscosity
of 1-4 kPoise [100-400 Pa.s] at 100 s-1 and 232°C, said copolymers being 
characterised by a melting point in the range of about 160°C to about 170°C
(which closely approaches the melting point of PVdF), and 50-10 wt% of
thermoplastic acrylic resin. The resulting coatings are said to be
characterised by improved flexibility, crack resistance and surface
smoothness (as opposed to surface roughness or "orange peel" associated
