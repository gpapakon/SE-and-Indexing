<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bottle of synthetic resin which mounts thereto a handle for facilitating handling 
of the bottle. The handle (11) is formed integrally with a pair of mount beam pieces (13) which have engagement 

projections (15) at inner sides thereof. The bottle of synthetic resin is subjected to biaxial stretching blow molding 
while using the mount beam pieces (13) as insert members, so that it is possible to positively mount the handle (11) 

to the bottle. In addition, there can be provided auxiliary fitting portions such as fitting projections (25) in order to 

prevent falling-off of the handle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synthetic resin
bottle with a handle comprising a handle and a bottle body
which are separately molded and securely joined together,
wherein the bottle body is formed by biaxial oriented blow
molding, and its production method.Japanese Published Unexamined Utility Model Laid Open
No. 1988 (S63)-147429 disclosed a typical large-sized
synthetic resin bottle with a handle in which a handle and a
bottle body are separately molded and joined together.The conventional bottle comprises as follows. The
bottle body is formed by biaxial oriented blow molding.
During the blow molding, a recessed portion is vertically
formed in an arc-like configuration at a rear portion of the
bottle body, an engaging convexity extending in a vertical
direction is formed in an arc-like configuration at the
center of the recessed portion, grooves of which both ends
are closed are vertically formed in an arc like configuration
on the both side surfaces of the engaging convexity.The handle comprises a pair of front frames formed in an 
arc-like configuration and a grip portion connecting the
upper ends and the lower ends of the front frames and is
formed by injection molding. During the injection molding,
engaging projections are formed at the both sides of the
front frames.By strongly pushing the handle from the rear side to the
recessed portion of the bottle body, the engaging projections
of the handle are constrained to pass over engaging portions
disposed on the tip of the engaging convexity so that the
handle is joined to the bottle body not to be detachable.The conventional technique as mentioned above has
problems as follows.Since the joint of the handle to the bottle body
requires strong putting force, an equipment used for joining
the handle to the bottle body is required, thereby increasing
the production cost.The thickness of the bottle body is thin because the
bottle body is formed by biaxial oriented blow molding.
Therefore, when the strong putting force is applied to the
body to join the handle thereto, there is a possibility of
irregular deformation such as buckling deformation of the
bottle body by this force, thereby sometime producing a
rejected article when joining the handle.Since the thickness of the bottle body is thin because
the bottle body is formed by biaxial oriented blow molding,
it is easy to produce an elastic deflection by the load on
the portion engaged with the handle. The joining force
between the bottle body and a handle becomes weak due to the 
elastic deflection
