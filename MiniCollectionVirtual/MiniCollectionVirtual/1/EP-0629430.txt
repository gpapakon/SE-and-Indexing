<ABSTRACT>
In a method and apparatus for desulfurizing exhaust 
gas, wherein combustion furnace desulfurization and flue 

desulfurization by means of limestone are effected, a 
desulfurization rate is enhanced, a dust precipitator is 

operated stably, and generation of harmful substance (CaSO₃) 
is suppressed. 
The present invention proposed a 
method for desulfurizing exhaust gas, wherein 

desulfurizing operations within a combustion furnace and 
within an exhaust gas flue by means of limestone are combined. 

The method is characterized in that after fly ash produced after 
desulfurization within the exhaust gas flue serving as a 

desulfurizing flue was collected, a part or whole of the fly 
ash is again charged into a high-temperature section within 

the combustion furnace , collection of the fly ash is 
carried out at the outlet of the combustion furnace and at 

the upper stream of the desulfurizing flue, an effective 
component part of said collected fly ash is used as a 

desulfurizing agent within the desulfurizing flue , and 
the remainder publicly harmless component part is abandoned 

to the outside of the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a desulfurizing 
method for exhaust gas of 
boilers for use in electric power generation plant or in 
industry plant. A desulfurizing method and a desulfurizing 
apparatus for combustion exhaust gas of a combustion furnace 
in a boiler or the like in the prior art, is shown in Fig. 
3. In this figure, pulverized coal 11 and pulverized 
limestone (CaCO3) 12 are fed to a combustion furnace 10, and 
desulfurization within furnace is carried out. SOx component 
in the combustion gas exhausted from the combustion furnace 
10 is further desulfurized in a desulfurizing flue 20 in 
which slurry 21 is sprayed. This slurry 21 is produced by 
mixing a part 31 of fly ash collected from the combustion gas 
exhausted from the desulfurizing flue 20 by means of an 
electrostatic precipitator (hereinafter called EP) 30 with 
water 32 in a mixing machine 40. In the slurry 21 produced by mixing the fly ash 
collected by means of the EP 30 with water is contained  
 
Ca(OH)2 produced from the limestone fed into the combustion 
furnace 10, and through the following reaction, desulfurization 
of combustion gas in the desulfurizing flue 20 is 
effected by the slurry 21: 
Ca(OH)2 + SO2 + 1/2 O2 → CaSO4 + H2OIn these desulfurizing method and desulfurizing 
apparatus in the prior art, in order to operate EP 30 stably, 
gas temperatures at an inlet and an outlet of the 
desulfurizing flue 20 are set at temperatures sufficiently 
higher than a saturation temperature. The remainder 33 of the fly ash collected in the EP 
30 is subjected to predetermined treatment as EP ash. Also, 
the gas having dust such as the fly ash and the like removed 
in the EP 30 is released to the atmosphere through a stack 
50. The furnace desulfurization by means of limestone 
12 in the above-described combustion furnace 10 is carried 
out as represented by the following formulae: 
CaCO3 → CaO + CO2CaO + SO2 + 1/2 O2 → CaSO4In addition, the desulfurization by means of slurry 
in the above-mentioned desulfurizing flue 20 is carried out 
as represented by the following formulae: 
CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2Ca(OH)2 + SO2 + 1/2 O2 → CaSO4 + H2OHowever, in the above-described desulfurizing 
method and apparatus in the prior art, a desulfurization rate 
in the desulfurizing flue 20 is poor. Desulfurization here 
is the more effective, the lower a gas temperature is as 
shown in Fig. 1. It is to be noted that in Fig. 1, curve (Ca/S)1 
shows the case where unreacted CaO is present in a large 
amount as compared to the case represented by

A method for desulfurizing exhaust gas, wherein 
desulfurization within a combustion furnace (10) by means of added 

limestone is followed by desulfurization of the exhaust gases 
within an exhaust gas flue serving as a desulfurizing flue, 

the fly ash produced after desulfurization within the exhaust 
gas flue is collected, characterized in that a part or whole of said collected fly 

ash is again charged into a high-temperature section within 
the combustion furnace (10), further collection of the fly 

ash is carried out at the outlet of the combustion furnace and at 
the upper stream of the desulfurizing flue, an effective 

component part, containing CaO, of said further collected fly 
ash is used after being mixed with water as a desulfurizing agent 

within the desulfurizing flue (20), and the remainder publicly 
harmless component part comprising CaSO
