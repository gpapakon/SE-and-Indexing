<ABSTRACT>
A thermally activated pressure relief valve (10) includes a valve housing (12) with an opening (28) communicating with an interior of a pressure vessel, and a passage (78) from the opening (28), through a cavity (20) of the housing (12), to an outlet (26). A seal plug (14) within the cavity (20) creates a seal (116) of the passage (78). A thermal trigger (18) engages the seal plug (14) to maintain the seal (116) when a temperature adjacent to the housing (12) is below a predetermined value. When the temperature reaches the predetermined value, the thermal trigger (18) releases the seal plug (14), thereby breaking the seal (116) and exposing a flow path between the opening (28) and outlet (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
 PRESSURERELIEFVALVEWITHTHERMALTRIGGERANDMOVABLE SEALPLUGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a relief valve. More particularly, the present invention relates to a thermally activated relief valve for use with a compressed gas storage cylinder (or pressure vessel) .In high pressure compressed natural gas systems, it is a requirement to provide a means by which the pressure vessel can be relieved of its gas charge in the event of an excessively high external temperature(e.g., a fire near the vessel). The standard approach has been to incorporate a fusible plug into the design of the system (pressure vessel, valve) that is continuously exposed to the direct pressure of the gas charge. " A fusible plug is a fitting that contains a slug of eutectic material that blocks and seals an outlet passage while the external temperature is below a predetermined yield point. When the temperature of the fusible plug reaches the yield temperature, the fusible material melts to provide a pathway for the pressurized gas to escape.In principle, this approach to temperature relief is acceptable. A problem arises, however, when the fusible plug is exposed to the continuous high pressures of the gas charge at temperatures approaching the yield point of the eutectic material. In such condition, extrusion of the fusible slug may occur, thus producing a potential leak path. A number of varying strategies can be applied to correct this problem through modification of the fusible plug (e.g. , reducing bore diameter, increasing the yield temperature of the eutectic material) . None of the strategies mentioned have thus far completely 

 eli inated the problem.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a thermally activated pressure relief valve which includes a valve housing with an inlet for communicating with an interior of a pressure vessel, and a passage from the inlet, through the valve housing, to an outlet for communicating with the exterior of the valve housing. A generally cylindrical-shaped seal plug is disposed within a cavity of the housing and across the passage between the inlet and the outlet, with a flat surface at a first end of the seal plug for sealing the passage. A radial shoulder frames the passage to provide a sealing surface against which the flat surface of the seal plug contacts to create a seal. A beveled annular exterior surface at a second end of the seal plug contacts a thermal trigger.The thermal trigger incorporates a trigger ball into a channel at a first end of the

The valve of claim 1 wherein the seal plug comprises: a cylindrical-shaped member having a hollow cavity opposite the first side and generally longitudinally aligned with the passage, the cavity open to a first end of the passage; and an exhaust port between the first side and the cavity and communicating with the cavity, the exhaust port further communicating with a second end of the passage. 


4. The valve of claim 3 wherein the shoulder is at the second end of the passage and includes an o-ring between the shoulder and the first side for enhancing the fluid-tight seal. 5. The valve of claim 4 wherein the communication passage is configured such that movement of the first side of the seal plug away from the shoulder exposes the interior of the receptacle to the second end of the passage, allowing gas pressure to escape through the exhaust port and the cavity, and out the first end of the passage.
