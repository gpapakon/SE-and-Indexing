<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for processing photographic material in a 
liquid filled process bath (12, 13), the bath (12, 13) in use being 

filled from a collapsible storage container (15) by a delivery pump 
(19) . A sensor (23) determines when the liquid has reached a 

predetermined level in the bath to control the delivery pump . The 
bath (12, 13) is further provided with a volumetric exit pump (25) 

for removal of predetermined volumes of liquid from the bath causing 
the delivery pump to deliver liquid from the container (15) to 

maintain said level and regenerate the process liquid in the bath.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for the processing of
exposed photographic material, and in particular for apparatus for
developing colour proofs, and a method of regeneration of the
process liquid used in such apparatus.In the development of proofs particularly colour proofs the
photographic plate will pass through a development process in which
the plate passes through in turn a developing section, a fixing
section, a wash section and a drying section. In the developing and
fixing sections a plate typically passes through a bath of process
liquid. The process liquid in the respective bath will degenerate
due to chemical reaction with the photographic material, and
oxidation due to contact with the air. The process liquid in the
bath will drop in level due to carry-over on the photographic
materials and due to evaporation. It is therefore necessary to add
fresh liquid to the bath. This addition thus depends on the amount
of processed material but it will be time-dependent as well.It is known to add fresh liquid to the bath by means of so-called
chicken-feed bottles that supply liquid as the liquid level
in the bath lowers due to carry-over, but also due to intentional
removal of used liquid in order to cause spontaneous replacement by
fresh liquid for reasons of oxidation compensation. Such removal
occurs by opening a discharge valve in a bottom conduit of the tank,
and the used liquid flows in a waste collection vessel. A
disadvantage of this system is premature oxidation of procesing
liquid in the bottle.It is further known to carry out bath control by means of so-called
cubitainers, i.e. a collapsable plastic bag in a rectangular
cardboard box, which is in connection with a supply conduit through
which liquid is withdrawn and pumped in the processing station under
the control of a level sensor in the station, and a return conduit
via which liquid can return to the cubitainer. The return conduit
is normally closed by a discharge valve. This valve is opened for 
certain periods to withdraw an amount of liquid from the bath and
automatically produce thereby its replacement by fresh liquid, in
order to compensate for oxidation of the bath. It has been shown
that time-controlled operation of this discharge valve, unlike the
valve in a chicken-feed system comprising a waste collection vessel,
does not produce true time-dependent discharge rates because the air
pressure in the cubitainer fluctuates as a consequence of the airtight
connection of the supply and return conduits to the cubitainer
and of

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for processing photographic material and which
includes at least one process bath (12 or 13), the or each bath (12

or 13) in use being filled with processing liquid held in a sealed
collapsible container (15), a delivery pump (19) for removing liquid

from said container (15) and delivering it to said respective bath,
a respective sensor (23) for determining when the liquid has reached

a predetermined level in said bath to control the delivery pump, and
discharge means (25) for removing predetermined volumes of liquid

from the bath and returning them to said container, characterised in
that said discharge means is formed by a volumetric pump in an exit

of the bath.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that it further
includes a timer control (27) which causes the discharge means (25)

to operate for a determined period of time at regular time
intervals.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, which includes a second
sensor means (31) for monitoring the quantity of photographic

material processed in the bath and/or processor, said sensor means
(31) also controlling the discharge means (25).
Apparatus according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
apparatus includes a second process bath (13).
A method of regenerating a process liquid in a photographic
development process in which photographic material passes through a

bath (12 or 13) of said liquid, the liquid being fed to the bath (13
or 13) to maintain the liquid level therein at a predetermined

level, and predetermined volumes of used liquid being discharged from the bath causing the
new liquid to be fed to the bath to maintain said level, the process

liquid fed to the bath being provided in an enclosed collapsible
container (15), and discharged process liquid being received in said

same collapsible container, characterised in that the discharge of
said liquid occurs by means of a volumetric pump.
A method according to claim 5, characterised in that the ratio 
of the volume of the bath to the container is in the ratio of 1:6 to

10 and about 2% of the bath content is returned to the container per
minute.
A method as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterised in that
liquid is also removed from the bath after a predetermined quantity

of photographic material has passed through the bath.
