<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for interlacing a sequence of data elements The invention relates to a method of interlacing a source sequence comprising N data elements, delivering an interlaced sequence corresponding to the said source sequence. According to the invention, the said method comprises at least one interlacing step associating the data element of index j of the said interlaced sequence with the data element of index i of the said source sequence, the value j being determined from the value i in the following way:  j = (a.i + b) [modulo N] + 1  where:     1
<
/=i
<
/=N and 1
<
/=j
<
/=N;   a is a first predetermined whole number, with N, such that   2 
<
/= a 
<
/= N-1; and   b is a predetermined whole number such that: 0 
<
/= b 
<
/= N-1.

Method of interleaving a source sequence comprising N data elements delivering
an interleaved sequence corresponding to said source sequence, comprising at

least one interleaving stage associating the data element of index j of said
interleaved sequence to the data element of index i of said source sequence, the

value j being determined from the value i as follows:

j = (a.i + b)[modulo N] + 1

where:

1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ N;
a is a predetermined integer relatively prime with N and such that:

2 ≤ a ≤ N-1, and
b is a predetermined integer such that:

0 ≤ b ≤ N-1,

characterized in that the number a is chosen to maximize the smaller of the two
values a and E(N/a), the function E() being the function associating with a real

number its integer part.
Method according to claim 1 characterized in that it is applied to interleaving
digital signals organized into blocks of data elements each comprising N data

elements.
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterized in that said data elements
are bits.
Method according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in that it is used in a
digital mobile radio system.
Device (6) for interleaving a source sequence comprising N data elements
delivering an interleaved sequence corresponding to said source sequence,

comprising means for effecting at least one interleaving stage associating the
data element of index j of said interleaved sequence to the data element of index

i of said source sequence, the value j being determined from the value i as
follows:


j = (a.i + b)[modulo N] + 1

where:

1 ≤ i ≤ N and 1 ≤ j ≤ N;
a is a predetermined integer relatively prime with N and such that:

2 ≤ a ≤ N-1, and
b is a predetermined integer such that:

0 ≤ b ≤ N-1,

characterized in that the number a is chosen to maximize the smaller of the two
values a and E(N/a), the function E() being the function associating with a real

number its integer part.
