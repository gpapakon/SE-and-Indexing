portion (30) connected to the torsion beam (10). A control link (32) is 
pivotally connected at one end portion (34) thereof to the 

lateral link (26) and at the other end portion (36) thereof to the 
torsion beam (10). Centers (G,H) of the respective pivotal 

connections of the lateral link (26) to the vehicle body (22) and

United State Patent Application Serial No. 
07/858.714 filed by Takaaki UNO et al. on March 27, 1992 
which has been commonly assigned and now formally allowed 
on November 24, 1993: United State Patent Application Serial No. 
08/103,537 filed by Kazuki SHIDA et al. on August 9, 1993 
which has been commonly assigned and now pending: The present invention relates to a torsion beam 
type suspension for automotive vehicles. United States Patent No. 4,765,650 discloses a 
torsion beam type suspension including a lateral link 
connected to a vehicle body through a bushing assembly. Japanese Patent Application First Publication 
No. 2-254006 discloses a torsion beam type suspension 
including two links associated with a lateral link for 
controlling a lateral displacement of pivotal connection 
of the lateral link to a torsion beam. DE-A-42 10 132 according to the precharacterizing part of claim 
1 discloses a vehicle suspension comprising a torsion beam 
supporting left and right axes and a lateral link extending in 
a transverse direction of the vehicle body and pivotally 
connected at one end portion to said vehicle body and at the 
other end portion to the torsion beam. In order to prevent a 
lateral displacement of the vehicle body, relative to the 
torsion beam, a control link is provided pivotally connected to 
said lateral link and said torsion beam.  
 An object of the present invention is to 
provide a suspension which can reduce a bending moment or 
stress applied to a lateral link. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a suspension in which the lateral link has an 
enhanced rigidity. These objects have been solved by the features of claim 1. Further embodiments have been claimed in the sub-claims.

of a rear suspension of a vehicle, according to 
the present invention; Fig. 2 is a top plane view of the rear 
suspension of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is an enlarged view of an essential part

connected at one end portion (28) thereof to said 
vehicle body (22) about a first axis (A) and at 

the other end portion (30) thereof to said torsion 
beam (10) about a second axis (B) parallel to said 

first axis (A); and 
a control link (32) pivotally connected at one end 
portion (34) thereof to said lateral link (26) 

about a third axis (C) and at the other end 
portion (36) thereof to said torsion beam (10) 

about a fourth axis (D) parallel to said third 
axis (C);
characterized in that
said lateral link (26) comprises first and second 
plates (38,40) each of the plates (38,40) being  

 
provided with a bent portion (42,44) cooperating 

to form a space (48) between said plates (38,40) 
in which said control link (32) is disposed, the 

bent portion (42) of at least one (38) of said plates 
(38,40) being provided with an opening (82), 

whereby the centres (G,H) of the respective 
pivotal connections of the lateral link (26) to
