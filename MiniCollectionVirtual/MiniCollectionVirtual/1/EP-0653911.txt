<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions are described for treating contaminants in material intended for (in vivo) use, and in particular blood and blood products for human use such as platelets. Contaminants in blood cell preparations are inactivated using 8-methoxypsoralen prior to long term storage and transfusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application
relates to an improvement over the disclosure in WO-A-93/17553.The invention generally relates to the inactivation
of contaminants in material intended for in vivo use, and
in particular the inactivation of microorganisms in blood
preparations.Whole blood collected from volunteer donors for
transfusion recipients is typically separated into its
components: red blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Each
of these fractions are individually stored and used to
treat a multiplicity of specific conditions and disease
states. For example, the red blood cell component is
used to treat anemia; the concentrated platelet component
is used to control bleeding; and the plasma component is
used frequently as a source of Clotting Factor VIII for
the treatment of hemophilia.Ideally, all blood cell preparations should be from
freshly drawn blood and then immediately transfused to
the recipient. However, the logistics of operating a
blood donor center preclude this possibility in the vast
majority of cases. Transfusions are needed day and night
and it is difficult, if not impossible, to arrange for
donor recruiting at unusual hours. Consequently, modern
blood donor centers must use stored blood products.In the United States, blood storage procedures are
subject to regulation by the government. The maximum
storage periods for the blood components collected in
these systems are specifically prescribed. For example,
whole blood components collected in an "open" (i.e. non-sterile)
system must, under governmental rules, be
transfused within twenty-four hours and in most cases 
within six to eight hours. By contrast, when whole blood
components are collected in a "closed" (i.e. sterile)
system the red blood cells can be stored up to forty-two
days (depending upon the type of anticoagulant and
storage medium used) and plasma may be frozen and stored
for even longer periods.Murphy and Gardner, New Eng.J.Med. 280:1094 (1969),
demonstrated that platelets stored as platelet-rich
plasma (PRP) at 22°C possessed a better invivo half-life
than those stored at 4°C. Thus, more acceptable platelet
concentrates could be transfused after storage at room
temperature. Until recently, the rules allowed for
platelet concentrate storage at room temperature for up
to seven days (depending upon the type of storage
container). However, it was recognized that the
incidence of bacterial growth and subsequent transfusion
reactions in the recipient increased to unacceptable
levels with a seven day old platelet concentrate.
