<ABSTRACT>
In an aircraft, a pressure swing adsorption system (23) is 
used both for removing carbon dioxide and water vapour 

from recycled cabin air and for producing in an emergency 
oxygen from pressurized engine bleed air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the alteration of the composition 
of gas supplied to an enclosed space and is particularly 
applicable to aircraft. An example of an enclosed space which requires gases of 
differing compositions is the space formed by the 
passenger and crew carrying zones of an aircraft. In 
commercial aircraft, air for passengers in the cabin and 
for the crew in the flight deck is derived from a source 
external to the cabin and flight deck. In order to reduce 
the requirement for air from such an external air supply, 
an air re-circulation system is commonly provided in which 
air from the flight deck and cabin is taken, filtered and 
cooled and then returned to the cabin and the flight deck, 
often with the addition of a small proportion of fresh 
air. The air from the cabin and flight deck contains 
significant quantities of carbon dioxide and water 
vapour. In order to reduce the volume of carbon dioxide 
and water vapour in the recycled air, a proportion of the 
recycled air is passed through a pressure swing adsorption 
system which removes carbon dioxide and water vapour and 
returns the carbon dioxide and water vapour depleted air 
to the remainder of the recycled air, which is then 
returned to the cabin and flight deck.  
 Suitable pressure swing adsorption systems are well known 
and are described, for example, in EP-A-0332390. There is also a requirement in aircraft for a supply of 
oxygen in emergency in the event of cabin and/or flight 
deck depressurization. This is achieved by the use of a 
separate system including masks for the passengers and the 
flight deck crew supplied from a separate source of 
oxygen. For example, there are available candles which on 
combustion release oxygen. An alternative is disclosed in US-A-4428372 where a 
pressure swing adsorption system takes engine bleed air, 
increases the oxygen content of the air by the adsorption 
of nitrogen and then supplies the oxygen-rich air to an 
emergency oxygen supply system. Some oxygen-rich air from 
the pressure swing adsorption system is supplied to a 
storage tank and is drawn from the tank in the event that 
there is an interruption in the supply of oxygen-enriched 
air from the pressure swing adsorption system. According to a first aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a method of changing the composition of a gas in 
an enclosed space comprising supplying a first gas having 
a first composition from said enclosed space to a pressure 
swing adsorption system, modifying the composition of said
