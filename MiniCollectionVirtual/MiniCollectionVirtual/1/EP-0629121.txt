<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning machine operating with granules having a pump for ejecting liquid optionally with or without granules which are heavier than the liquid, through nozzles against the goods to be cleaned in a treatment space (10) connected to the suction side of the pump via a bottom outlet (11). A granule valve having a socket (38) open at each end thereof is associated with the bottom outlet, said socket being guided for vertical displacement between the upper position with an opening at the lower end of the socket for drawing liquid with granules entrained therein by the pump from the treatment space at a lower level, and a lower position with the opening at the lower end of the socket closed for drawing liquid only by the pump from a higher level at the upper end of the socket. A projecting circumferential flange (49) is provided on the socket (38) below the upper end thereof said flange forming together with a cap (44) provided over the socket, a labyrinth seal for preventing granules from being withdrawn together with the liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cleaning machine 
operating with granules including a pump for ejecting 
liquid optionally with or without granules heavier than 
the liquid, through nozzles against goods to be cleaned 
in a treatment space which is connected to the suction 
side of the pump via a bottom outlet having a granule 
valve associated therewith, said valve comprising a 
socket open at both ends, which is guided for vertical 
displacement between a position in which the lower end of 
the socket is raised from the bottom of the treatment 
space and the upper end of the socket is engaged with a 
stationary cap provided above the socket, to allow the 
pump to draw liquid with granules entrained therein from 
the treatment space at a lower level at the lower end of 
the socket, and a lower position wherein the lower end of 
the socket engages the bottom of the treatment space to 
allow the pump to draw liquid only from an upper level at 
the upper end of the socket, the granules being collected 
on the bottom of the treatment space. The principle of allowing the pump to draw liquid 
from a lower level in the treatment space when the liquid 
shall contain granules, and from an upper level when 
liquid only shall be circulated through the treatment 
space, is disclosed in EP-B1-0 169 847 which discloses 
also an embodiment of the granule valve which is of the 
kind referred to above. It has been found that in a 
cleaning machine operating with granules, which has a 
granule valve of said embodiment, an unsatisfactory separation 
of the granules from the liquid may occur when 
liquid only is to be circulated through the treatment 
space due to the fact that heavy splashing is imparted 
to the liquid contained in the lower part of the  
 
treatment space, functioning as a liquid tank, when 
liquid under heavy pressure and in large quantity is 
ejected against the goods to be cleaned in the treatment 
space. By the movement of the liquid in the tank movement 
is imparted also to the granules resting on the bottom 
and then the granules can be withdrawn by the liquid 
drawn by the pump at the upper end of the socket, i.e. at 
the upper level. EP-B1-0 195 959 describes a cleaning machine 
operating with granules having a granule valve which is 
also of the kind referred to above but wherein the risk 
of granules being withdrawn by the liquid to the pump 
when drawing from the upper level being eliminated by 
providing between the upper edge of the socket and the 
periphery of the cap a strainer, e.g. a filter

<CLAIMS>
A cleaning machine operating with granules 
including a pump for ejecting liquid optionally with or 

without granules heavier than the liquid, through nozzles 
against goods to be cleaned in a treatment space (10) 

which is connected to the suction side of the pump via a 
bottom outlet (11) having a granule valve associated 

therewith, said valve comprising a socket (38) open at 
both ends, which is guided for vertical displacement 

between a position in which the lower end of the socket 
is raised from the bottom (12) of the treatment space 

(10) and the upper end of the socket is engaged with a 
stationary cap (44) provided above the socket, to allow 

the pump to draw liquid with granules entrained therein 
from the treatment space at a lower level at the lower 

end of the socket (38), and a lower position wherein the 
lower end of the socket engages the bottom (12) of the 

treatment space to allow the pump to draw liquid only 
from an upper level at the upper end of the socket, the 

granules being collected on the bottom of the treatment 
space, 
characterized
 in that a projecting 
circumferential flange (49) is provided on the socket 

(38) below the upper end thereof, said flange forms 
together with the cap (44) a labyrinth seal for 

preventing granules from being withdrawn together with 
the liquid at the upper end of the socket when the socket 

is in the lower position. 
A cleaning machine as in claim 1 or 2 wherein 
the cap (44) is conical the apex thereof being directed 

upwards. 
A cleaning machine as in claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the circumferential flange (49) on the socket (38) projects 

radially from the socket.  
 
A cleaning machine as in any of claims 1 to 3 
wherein the flange extends beyond the circumference of 

the cap (44). 
A cleaning machine in any of claims 1 to 4 
wherein the flange (49) has an edge portion angled upwards 

so that the flange forms a shallow bowl with flat 
bottom. 
A cleaning machine as in any of claims 1 to 5 
wherein the lower end of the socket (38) is provided with 

an elastic sealing ring (41) to be engaged with the 
bottom. 
A cleaning machine as in claim 6 wherein the 
elastic sealing ring extends under the end surface of the 

socket (38) covering said surface. 
A cleaning machine as in any of claims 1 to 7 
wherein the socket (38) forms strainer apertures (39, 40) 

over a portion adjacent the lower end of the socket to 
allow passage of liquid while granules being separated 

therefrom. 
A cleaning machine as in any of claims 1 to 8 
wherein a splash attenuating grid (50) having square 

openings defined by vertical plates (51, 52) is provided 
over the bottom (12) below the flange (49) on the socket 

(38).
