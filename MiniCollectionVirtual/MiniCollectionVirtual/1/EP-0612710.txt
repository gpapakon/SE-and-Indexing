A method for controlling the rate of spent 
catalyst which is recycled into a hydrogenation means, 

wherein fatty acids and/or fatty acid derivatives, 
hydrogen, fresh catalyst and a dispersion containing 

spent catalyst are supplied to the hydrogenation means 
and at temperatures in the range of 100 to 400Â°C and 

pressures in the range of 20 to 400 bar a product 
stream is produced which contains fatty alcohols and 

spent catalyst, characterised in that the product 
stream is partly circulated (12), a first partial 

stream (15) is withdrawn from the circuit at a 
controllable rate and is passed through a separation 

means (18), product (19) rich in fatty alcohols and, 
separately therefrom, a dispersion (20) containing 

spent catalyst are withdrawn from the separation means, 
and the dispersion is recycled into the hydrogenation 

means, that a second partial stream (30) is removed 
from the circuit at a controllable rate, the spent 

catalyst is separated off and removed from the process 
(34) and that in order to increase the rate of spent 

catalyst supplied to the hydrogenation means the rate 
of the second partial stream is decreased and that in 

order to decrease the rate of spent catalyst supplied 
to the hydrogenation means the rate of the second 

partial stream is increased. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that fresh catalyst (26) is admixed to the dispersion 

containing spent catalyst. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the spent catalyst is separated from the second 

partial stream by centrifuging or decanting.  
 
A method according to Claim 1 or 3, characterized 
in that when separating off the spent catalyst from the 

second partial stream a liquid stream (35) containing 
fatty alcohol is obtained, which is admixed to the 

product stream.
