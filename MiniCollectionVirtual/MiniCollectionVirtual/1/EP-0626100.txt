Method of producing a semiconductor structure with several vertical (13) and at
least one lateral semiconductor element (14), which are integrated in a slice-like

semiconductor body (1) with a first surface (2) and a second surface (3) disposed opposite
thereto, wherein at least one lateral semiconductor element (13) is arranged below the first

surface and the vertical semiconductor elements (14) extend between the first and the
second surface, comprising the following method steps:


a) forming at least one partial structure (7) with at least one lateral semiconductor
element (13) in the semiconductor body (1) at the first surface (2);
b) forming several doped regions (4) and partial regions (5) embedded therein outside
the at least one partial structure (7);
c) surrounding the at least one partial structure (7) by at least one vertical, electrically
insulating wall (6), which extends to a specific depth from the first surface (2) into

the semiconductor body (1);
d) reducing the thickness of the semiconductor body (1) from the second surface (3)
in the region of the at least one partial structure (7) up to each insulating wall (6),

whereby a recess (9) arises each time in the semiconductor body (1);
e) applying an insulating layer on the base of each recess (9) and
f) structured metallising and/or passivating the first and second surface (2,3) in such
a manner that at least one lateral structural element (13) arises in the region above

the base (11) of each recess (9) and vertical structural elements (14) arise outside
the recesses (9).
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the second surface (3) is a

<
100
>
 plane, that the recess(es) (9) is or are produced by etching and that a KOH solution
is used as etching solution, wherein walls, which lie in the 
<
III
>
 planes, arise at the
recess(es). 
Method according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised thereby that the at least
one partial structure (7) has a further region (4), which has the opposite conductivity type

as the starting material of the semiconductor body (1).
Method according to claim 3, characterised thereby that partial regions (5) of
predetermined conductivity type and predetermined doping concentration, which

determine the structural element type, and let into the further region (4).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that for
producing the at least one electrically insulating wall (6) corresponding trenches are

produced by plasma etching and that the trenches are subsequently filled with an
electrically insulating material.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that the
base (11) of each recess (9) is covered by a silicon oxide layer (15).
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby that the walls (10)
and the base (11) of each recess (9) are covered by a silicon oxide layer (15).
Method according to claim 6 or 7, characterised thereby that the regions of the
semiconductor body (1) which are not to be oxidised are initially covered with a Si3N4

layer before the silicon oxide layer (15) is produced by thermal oxidation.
Method according to of claims 6 to 8, characterised thereby that the silicon oxide
layer (15) is coated with an electrically non-conductive layer (16).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that each
recess (9) is at least partly filled with a filler material (21).
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that at
least one trench, which in depth corresponds with the separating trenches (6') for the

electrically insulating walls (6) and is formed to be wider than these and which serves as a
test window (23), is formed in the semiconductor body (1) and that the thickness of the

semiconductor body (1) is reduced until the base of the trench is broken through.
