<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
treating poly(esteramides) to increase the heat and 
storage stability thereof. Poly(esteramides) are known to be useful 
bioabsorbable polymeric materials derived from 
reacting diamidediols with dicarboxylic acids, 
derivatives thereof or bischloroformates. Such 
polymers and some of their uses are described in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,343,931; 4,529,792; 4,534,349; 
4,669,474; 4,719,917; 4,883,618; and 5,013,315 (all 
Barrows et al.). An increasing number of surgically implantable 
devices that only function for a relatively short 
period of time in vivo are being designed from 
synthetic polymers that are eliminated from the body 
by hydrolytic degradation and subsequent metabolism 
after serving their intended purpose. The molecular 
weight of such "bioabsorbable" polymers is an 
important parameter in determining whether or not a 
particular lot of polymer will perform properly for an 
adequate length of time in any specific application. 
Thus, if significant loss of molecular weight occurs 
during processing of the polymer to fabricate a 
device, such as by melt extrusion, then the device may 
fail prematurely in vivo as hydrolysis shifts the 
molecular weight distribution below a minimum range 
required for the device to function properly. Some 
causes which may lead to reduction in molecular weight 
and premature device failure include degradation due 
to melt processing conditions (e.g., the high 
temperature and shear conditions encountered during 
extrusion processing), due to moisture in the polymer, 
and due to synthesis residues (e.g., unreacted  
 
precursor materials and reaction by-products) in the 
polymer, e.g., acid chlorides. Loss of molecular weight upon extrusion is 
commonly encountered with polyesters even when 
moisture in the resin has been reduced to the lowest 
possible level. For example, poly-L-lactide, a well 
known bioabsorbable polyester has not yet been melt 
extruded into fiber with molecular weight much higher 
than 100,000 since the extrusion process typically 
degrades higher molecular weight fractions to this 
relatively constant maximum value. Bioabsorbable poly(esteramides) described in 
U.S. Patents 4,343,931 and 4,529,792 offer an 
advantage over poly-L-lactide and related polyesters 
in that a lower molecular weight is adequate to 
achieve comparable fiber strength due to the 
intermolecular hydrogen bonding provided by the amide 
linkages. Fibers made of such polymers exhibit 
comparable strength to those made of
