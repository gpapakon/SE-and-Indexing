<ABSTRACT>
A printing device including a memory for storing 
print information transmitted from a host computer by an 

amount corresponding to at least one page of a prescribed 
sheet includes a printer for carrying out a printing 

operation of information stored in the memory, a print 
control for controlling the memory to successively store 

the print information therein in response to an instruction 
from the host computer and for controlling the 

printer to read out the stored print information and to 
carry out a printing operation of the read-out print 

information, a re-print control device for controlling the 
printing device to read out the information stored in the 

memory after the printing operation and to carry out a re-printing 
operation of the information, and an inhibiting 

device for inhibiting the re-printing operation by the re-print 
control device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printing device having
a function of re-printing the same print information after
a print of the information is output.In a conventional printing device such as a laser
printer or the like, print information that is transmitted
in accordance with a print requirement from a host computer
is temporarily stored into a reception buffer in a RAM,
and a CPU converts the print information stored in the
reception buffer to image information suitable for a
printing operation in accordance with a program stored in
a ROM. The print information is then stored into an image
buffer. At the same time, the reception buffer suitably
receives new print information from the host computer, and
the CPU successively converts the print information to
image information and stores it in the image buffer.At the time when a predetermined amount of image
information, for example, image information of one page of
a prescribed sheet (hereinafter referred to as "one-page
image information") is stored in the image buffer, the
printing device temporarily ceases its receiving operation
of the print information from the host computer and
carries out a printing operation of the content of the
one-page image information. When the printing operation
for prior one-page image information has been completed,
the printing device receives and temporarily stores new
one-page print information into the reception buffer as
described above. Subsequently, in the same manner as
described above, image information of subsequent pages is
successively stored one by one into the image buffer and
subjected to the printing operation. If an operator
desires to obtain a print of the just-prior print (a print
obtained in the just-previous printing operation), the
same print command must be transmitted, and the same print 
information used for the previous printing operation must
be transmitted from the host computer to the print device
again. Therefore, the operator is required to repeat the
same operation, and the printing device is required to
receive the print information and carry out the data
processing again. Accordingly, the conventional printing
device takes a long time to obtain a duplicate print.In order to overcome the above problem, a printing
device as disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application
No. 59-71590 has been recently proposed. In view of
the technical knowledge that the one-page image information
stored in the image buffer remains until new image
information is transmitted from the reception buffer of
the

<CLAIMS>
A printing device (1) having a memory (4) for
storing print information transmitted from a host computer (5)

in an amount corresponding to at least one page of a prescribed
sheet, and printing means (7,8) for carrying out a printing

operation of the information stored in the memory (4), the
printing device comprising:


print control means (2) for controlling said memory (4)
to successively store the print information therein in response

to an instruction from said host computer (5) and for
controlling said printing means (7,8) to read out the stored

print information and to carry out a printing operation of the
read-out print information;
reprint control means (2,10a) for selectively controlling
said printing means (7,8) to read out the information stored in

said memory (4) again after the printing operation and to carry
out a reprinting operation of the information;
inhibiting means (2a,10) comprising:
read out inhibiting means for selectively inhibiting the
selective reprinting operation of said reprint control means

(2,10a) by having a re-print release key (10c) for inhibiting
said reprint control means from reading out the print

information from said memory (4) if the re-print release key
(10c) is pushed;
a timer (2a) for counting a lapse time after the printing
operation;
an erase key (10b); and
an erasing means (S20) for erasing the print information
in said memory (4) when said erase key (10b) is pushed or said

timer counts a predetermined time provided that the re-print
release key is not pushed and reprint control means does not

execute the reprinting operation.
The printing device as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said memory (4) stores print information in an amount

corresponding to a plurality of pages of prescribed sheets,
said reprint control means (2) comprising means for specifying

which of said print information of said plurality of pages to
send to said printing means (7,8). 
A printing device according to claim 1 wherein the

memory is a RAM and the printing device further comprises:

an input/output interface (6) for providing communication
between said printing device (1) and said host computer (5);
a printer engine interface (8) for providing
communication between aaid printing device (1) and a printer

engine (7); and
a CPU (2) comprising the print control means, the reprint
control means and the inhibiting means.
The printing device as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3,
further comprising a key panel (10) having a print key (10a),
