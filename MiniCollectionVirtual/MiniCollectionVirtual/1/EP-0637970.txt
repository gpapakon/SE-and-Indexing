<ABSTRACT>
Substantially water-insoluble, crosslinked polypeptides containing 15 to 85 mole % of amino acid residues such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, phosphoserine, phosphohomoserine, phosphotyrosine, phosphothreonine, phosphoasparagine, or phosphoglutamine, and 15 to 85 mole % of amino acid residues such as lysine, arginine, asparagine, glutamine, serine or tyrosine, in which the degree of crosslinking is sufficient to result in a substantially water-insoluble polypeptide with the ability to absorb a 1 wt.% aqueous NaCl solution in an amount of at least 20 times the weight of the polypeptide, are useful as superabsorbents in devices such as diapers, etc. Mild alkaline hydrolysis of the crosslinked polypeptides increases their superabsorbency by two to three fold.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionPolyamino Acid SuperabsorbentsThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application serial no. 07/677,333, filed March 29, 1991, which is incorporated by reference.Technical FieldThe present invention relates to new polypeptides that have the capability of absorbing large amounts of water and aqueous solutions, in particular physiological saline solutions, and methods for preparing such polypeptides. These polymers are useful in a variety of applications including but not limited to sanitary goods, hygienic goods, water retaining agents, dehydrating agents, and control release agents for various chemicals.Background ArtIn general, superabsorbent polymers possess a structure in which the water-soluble polymer has been made insoluble by some process, typically by means of a cross-linking agent, resulting in polymers that have the power to absorb at least 20 times their weight in pure water. Water absorbing resins currently in use include hydrolysis products of starch-acrylonitrile graft polymers, carboxymethylcellulose, polycarboxylic acids, acrylamides, non-cross-linked polymer blends, cross-linked polyacrylate products and other resins such as polyvinyl alcohols (Mikita et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,703,067; Ofstead, R.F., U.S. Patent No. 4,771,089; and Siddall, J.H. et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,833,222. Brandt et -al. U.S. Patent No. Re. 32,649 also disclose hydrogel-forming polymer compositions based on polymerized unsaturated polymerizable acid group-containing monomers and a crosslinking agent. Superabsorbent polymers are polyanionic 

in nature and it is the hydration of these charged groups that leads to the absorbent characteristics (Masuda, F. , "Super absorbent polymers - characteristics and trends in development of applications," Chem. Econ. Enσiner. Rev.. vol. 15, pp. 19- 23 (1983).One problem with such resins is that the absorptive capacity is greatly reduced in the presence of physiological salines. This is an important aspect, in view of the uses of these polymers in diapers and personal hygiene applications. Additional drawbacks of these resins include cumbersome processes of syntheses in some cases and low heat resistance and rapid decay in other instances.Mixtures of α-amino acids can be thermally polymerized into proteinoids (Fox and Harada, Science, vol. 128, p. 1214 (1958) and J. Am. Chem. Soc. A vol. 82, pp. 3745-3751 (1959) at temperatures above 150°C. The syntheses require the presence of excess dicarboxylic amino acids for unknown reasons. However, the advantage of
