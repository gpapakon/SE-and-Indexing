<ABSTRACT>
Surgical adhesion barriers and methods of using such 
surgical adhesion barriers are provided. Surgical adhesion 

barriers according to the present invention have at least one 
layer of a bioabsorbable material comprising copolymers and/or 

block copolymers derived from trimethylene carbonate. 
Alternatively, a multilayer surgical structure having one or 

more bioabsorbable layers superimposed on a non-absorbable layer 
is useful for minimizing or preventing formation of fibrous 

adhesions between a healing trauma site and adjacent surrounding 
tissue. Alternatively, a bioabsorbable non-woven fabric in 

adherent contact with at least one bioabsorbable layer of foam, 
film, mesh, web or woven f
abric is also provided. One or more 
medicinal agents may be interposed between or disposed within 

any of the aforementioned layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to minimization and/or
prevention of post-endosurgical adhesions and more particularly,
to devices for preventing the formation of such adhesions
between a healing trauma site and adjacent surrounding tissue.Injury, surgical incision or abrasion to the
peritoneum, pleural or abdominal cavity results in an outpouring
of a serosanguinous exudate. The exudate subsequently
coagulates, producing fibrinous bands between abutting surfaces
which can become organized by fibroblast proliferation to become
collagenous adhesions. Adhesions are also known to form at bone
fracture sites where jagged, irregular bone edges form in the
area of the fracture. Bony spurs promote the growth of fibrous
adhesions between the bone fracture surface and surrounding
tissue.Adhesion formation following surgery or trauma is
generally considered to be undesirable. For example, adhesions
that form in relation to intestinal surgery, e.g., bowel
resection, hernia repair, etc. may cause obstruction of the
intestine. Adhesions that form near the bone fracture site may
reduce or hinder the normal movement of the area of repair by
restricting the natural movement of tendons over the adjacent
bone. Adhesions may also form in the vicinity of nerves and
disrupt nerve transmissions with a resultant diminution of
sensory or motor function. Various methods and substances have been used in the
hope of preventing post-operative adhesions. Certain drugs and
surfactants have been suggested. For example, U.S. Patent No.
4,911,926 is directed to adhesion prevention by application of
aqueous and non-aqueous compositions of a polyoxyalkylene block
co-polymer to injured areas of the peritoneal or pleural cavity
or organs situated therein subsequent to surgical injury.Another approach to adhesion prevention involves
application of a physical barrier at the area of surgical
injury. U.S. Patent No. 4,674,488 is directed to interposing a
barrier layer of soft biological tissue, such as collagen,
collagen-fabric films, collagen membranes, or reconstituted
collagen or Dacron® mesh, at the interface of a bone fracture
and the surrounding tissue. U.S. Patent No. 4,603,695 is
directed to a molded polymeric material for preventing adhesion
of vital tissues. The polymeric material is made of a
biodegradable and absorbable polymer such as certain polyesters,
collagen, amino acid polymers and chitin and may be placed where
there is a possibility of adhesion setting in.Other materials have also been used to form physical
barriers in an

comprises about 80 mole percent trimethylene

carbonate.
Use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the second
block comprises a copolymer having a predominant

amount of lactide.
