<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of an arrangement for the simultaneous sealing of a door pane (12) and of the roof region (35) of a motor-vehicle door, which arrangement has a one-piece profile (A) made of an elastomeric material, with a fastening region (1), which can be pushed onto the door flange (10), a sealing region (3) for the door pane (12) and a sealing element (2) for the region between the upper edge of the door and the roof (35). For a complete solution for the one-piece delivery and assembly of this arrangement, the invention makes provision for the fastening region (1), which is designed in a U shape and can be pushed onto a protruding door flange (10), to be covered over its entire outside by an aluminium strip (B) which has two vertically inwards protruding webs (16, 17) which run parallel to the protruding door flange (10) and can be clipped into two parallel, outwardly open slots (18, 19) in the limbs (5, 6) of the U-shaped fastening region (1).

An arrangement for simultaneous sealing of the door pane (12) 
and the door opening of an automobile, comprising an 

integral profile (A) of an elastomer material including a 
fastening portion (1) mountable on the door flange (10), a 

sealing portion (3) for said door pane (12) and a sealing 
element (2) for said door opening between upper door edge 

and roof characterized in that said channel-sectioned 
configured fastening portion (1; 54) mountable onto a 

downswept door flange (10; 53; 73) is covered by a 
laterally downswept sealing lip portion (8; 60) for the 

outer side of said door pane (12; 58; 86) on its full outer 
side by a strip (B) of rigid material which comprises two 

webs (16, 17; 51, 52; 71, 72) downswept inwardly at an 
approximate right angle which are oriented approximately 

parallel to said downswept door flange (10; 53; 73) and 
which can be clipped into place in two outwardly open slots 

(18, 19) in the legs (5, 6) of said channel-section 
fastening portion (1; 54). 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in 
that
 
   said strip (15; 50; 70) is made of aluminum. 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
said strip (15; 50; 70) is made of a rigid plastics 

material. 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
a latching lip (71; 79) is provided downswept from an 

inside sidewall (20) of said channel-section fastening 
portion (1; 54) covering said door flange (10, 53), said 

latching lip engaging an in-turn (22) at the free end of 
said door flange (10; 53).  

 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 4, characterized in that 
said in-turn is formed by a flanged edge (22) of said door 

flange (10). 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
the inside part of said window guide portion (3; 64) is 

extruded in place on the outer edge of the pane-side leg 
(6) of said channel-section fastening portion (1; 54), said 

part comprising an ebonite web (26; 64) oriented parallel 
to said pane (12; 58) and supported by a further portion of 

said door panel (25; 65) and a sealing lip (27, 28; 60, 61) 
of soft rubber located one each at the top and bottom end 

inclined to each other, said sealing lips contacting the 
inside of the closed pane (12; 58). 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
in the plane of said strip (15) at the roof-side leg (5) of 

said channel-section fastening portion (1) a sealing lip 
(36) is extruded in place to seal off said roof (35), this 

sealing lip latching into place in the footing portion by a 
bead-shaped protuberance (37) into a relieved groove (38) 

to the side of a web (16) of said strip (15). 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
in the plane of said strip (50) on the roof-side leg of 

said channel-section fastening portion (54) a sealing lip 
(56) is extruded into place to seal off said roof edge 

(57), a latching protuberance (55) downswept from said 
strip engaging the footing portion of said sealing lip. 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in 
that
 
   said channel-section fastening portion (1) having the 

laterally downswept holding portion (8) for said soft 
rubber sealing lip (9) is made of ebonite.  

 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 6, characterized in that 
said inside part (64) of said window guide portion 

comprises at the lower end a finger guard extending 
parallel to the pane in the form of a hollow profile (66) 

having guiding rubber portions (67, 68) on opposing sides 
of said hollow profile (66). 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
said strip (70) of rigid material is mounted directly on 

said downswept door flange (73), said strip featuring in 
the upper web (71) a groove (74) for receiving a sealing 

lip (76) to seal off said roof edge (77) and which together 
with the lower web portion (72) including two vertical 

raised faces encloses the actual window guide profile (85) 
of an elastomer material. 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 11, characterized in that 
said sealing lip (76) is configured as a hollow chambered 

profile having a fir-tree footing (78) for latching in 
place in said receiving groove (75). 
The arrangement as set forth in claim 11, characterized in that 
the outside strip portion (70) includes a raised face (90) 

protruding inwardly which engages a corresponding recess in 
said window guide profile (85). 
A method fabricating and fitting an arrangement as set forth 
in any of the claims 1 to 13 characterized in that the 

profile, consisting of the roof-side sealing portion, the 
channel-section fastening portion and the window guide 

portion is extruded in one piece from an elastomer having 
portions of differing hardness, said strip of a rigid 

material being clipped into place by its two downswept webs 
in said profile and the thereby finish-assembled profile 

being mounted on said door flange so that said latching lip 
latches behind the door flange edge.
