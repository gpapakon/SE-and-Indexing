a normally conductive or superconductive gate electrode, in which the characteristic

conversion layer is controllable by means of a change in temperature.

layer has a layer thickness in the range of the electron free path length in the 

conversion layer in the increased conductivity condition, preferably in the range of 5-20 
nm. 
Component according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the 
superconductive layer has a layer thickness in the region of the order of magnitude of 

its coherence length.
