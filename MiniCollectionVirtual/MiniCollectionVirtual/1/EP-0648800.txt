<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the 
production of a novel absorbent material and an absorbent 
article. Particularly, this invention relates to a method 
for the production of an absorbent material which, on 
contact with an aqueous liquid such as water or humor, 
absorbs the aqueous liquid and swells therewith to a great 
extent and to an absorbent article made thereof. More 
particularly, this invention relates to absorbent articles 
which are excellent in capacity for absorption, speed of 
absorption, and safety of use and preeminently excellent in 
the aspect of energy cost factor and, therefore, 
advantageously usable in such sanitary and medical articles 
as sanitary napkins and disposable diapers, in such 
agricultural and forestal articles as are used for 
preserving vegetables and meats in fresh state and for 
absorbing drips emanating from such perishable foods, and in 
various fields required for absorbing water and retaining 
absorbed water. The absorbent material mentioned above is useful by 
itself. It is also useful in sanitary materials, sheets for 
formation of dew and absorption of water, agricultural water 
retaining agents, water retaining agents in civil 
engineering structures, medical sheets, agents for 
preserving foodstuffs in fresh state, and absorbents for 
drips oozing from perishable foodstuffs. As absorbent resins, partially neutralized cross-linked 
polyacrylic acids, saponified acrylic ester-vinyl 
acetate copolymers, modified cross-linked polyvinyl 
alcohols, cross-linked isobutylene-maleic anhydride 
copolymers, hydrolyzed starch-acrylonitrile graft polymer, 
starch-acrylic acid graft polymer, and partially cross-linked  
 
polyethylene oxide have been heretofore known to the 
art. These absorbent resins have found extensive utility in 
a wide range of applications including sanitary absorbents 
such as sanitary napkins and disposable diapers in the 
hygienic field and water-retaining agents and dehydrating 
agents in the agricultural field and the civil engineering 
field. The absorbent resins thus used are generally in a 
powdery form or a granular form. In most cases of actual 
use, the powdery or granular absorbent resin is sandwiched 
between layers of paper, incorporated in pulp and compacted 
as by an operation of embossing, or fused and enveloped with 
a thermoplastic resin so as to be finished in the form of a 
sheet or a film. Various methods have been heretofore proposed for 
the purpose of causing an absorbent resin to be deposited 
fast on a
