<ABSTRACT>
A dielectric filter and a dielectric duplexer have
simple structures, in each of which the resonance frequency

of a TE mode is controlled in such a manner that no TE-mode
spurious response occurs in a band requiring attenuation.

Specifically, the distance between the central position of
each of inner-conductor-formed holes (2a, 2b) and a

widthwise line (C) of a dielectric block (1) is set to be
two times or more than the distance between the central

position of each of the holes (2a, 2b) and a lengthwise line
(H) thereof. With this arrangement, the resonance frequency

of a spurious mode such as a TE
101
 mode is shifted to the
low-frequency side to deviate the resonance frequency of the

spurious mode from a band requiring attenuation, for
example, from a band near the second-order harmonic of a TEM

mode, as a mode to be used. In addition, a communication
apparatus is formed by using one of the filter and the

duplexer described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dielectric filters and dielectric duplexers used in microwave bands and millimeter-wave bands, and the invention also relates to communication apparatuses using the same.Fig. 15A shows a perspective view of a conventional dielectric filter obtained by forming conductor films on a dielectric block and therein. In this figure, reference numeral 1 denotes a substantially rectangular-parallelepiped dielectric block, in which inner-conductor-formed holes 2a and 2b having inner conductors 3a and 3b formed on the inner surfaces thereof are formed. On external surfaces of the dielectric block 1, an outer conductor 4 is each formed. A non-inner-conductor-formed position g is disposed on the inner surface of each of the inner-conductor-formed holes 2a and 2b. In addition, on the external surfaces of the dielectric block 1, input/output electrodes 5a and 5b are formed in such a manner that the electrodes 5a and 5b are isolated from the outer conductors 4.With this arrangement, TEM-mode dielectric resonators are formed by using the dielectric block, the inner conductors, and the outer conductors. A comb-line coupling between the dielectric resonators is performed by stray capacitances generated at the non-inner-conductor-formed portions g so as to form a dielectric filter constituted of the two-stage resonator as an overall structure.In the dielectric filter formed by disposing the inner-conductor-formed holes in the substantially rectangular-parallelepiped dielectric block, in order to obtain specified characteristics, the outline dimensions of the dielectric block, the dimensions of the inner-conductor-formed holes, and the positions of the inner-conductor-formed holes disposed inside the dielectric block are determined. Particularly, the unloaded Q of the resonator increases depending on both the thickness tb between the inner-conductor-formed hole and a widthwise line of the dielectric block and the thickness ta between the inner-conductor-formed hole and a lengthwise line of thereof.Fig. 15B shows the relationship between the ratio of the thickness ta to the thickness tb as the aforementioned two distances and the unloaded Q of the resonator obtained when the length of a widthwise line C of a plane perpendicular to an axis of each of the inner-conductor-formed holes of the dielectric block is set to be 2.0 mm, the length of a lengthwise line H thereof is set to be 4.0 mm, and the axial length D of the inner-conductor-formed hole is set to be 4.0 mm. As shown here, regardless of
