<ABSTRACT>
Packaging for retaining a component together with an 
instrument package is disclosed. In a preferred 

embodiment, a foldable package made from a sheet of cut 
and folded paperboard material is used to retain an 

endoscope introducer (50) and attach the introducer to an 
instrument package containing an instrument that is used 

with the introducer. The disclosed foldable package 
comprises openings and flaps that retain both the proximal 

and distal ends of the introducer, and a proximal flap 
overlies the introducer. The proximal flap is used to 

release the package and expose the introducer, permitting 
it to be removed in one smooth motion. Methods of 

providing prepackaged surgical instruments for a procedure 
are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to packaging for medical 
devices and instruments, and more particularly relates to 
folded paper packages for retaining a component or device 
together with another package, such as retaining an 
endoscope introducer with a package containing an 
endoscopic suture loop and cannula. The packaging of medical devices, and in particular 
surgical instruments, is subject to a number of competing 
considerations. First, the packaging must properly 
surround an protect the device from damage and protect any 
personnel handling the package from injury. Second, the 
packaging materials must be chosen to accommodate any 
sterilization processes required for the device and retain 
its sterility. This requirement also affects which 
instruments are packaged together, a consideration also 
driven by the procedure being performed. It is currently 
standard practice to try to package instruments and 
related equipment together into a procedure kit where 
feasible. Finally, and possibly most importantly, in use 
the packaging must be unobtrusive and present the packaged 
items conveniently and quickly. Of course, medical device 
packages are also subject to more conventional 
considerations such as the cost of materials, the cost and 
complexity of tooling to make the package, ease of package 
assembly, and ease of manufacture and shipping both the 
empty package and the packaged components. The 
increasingly competitive economic environment exacerbates 
these sometimes competing considerations; efficacy must be 
achieved while costs are maintained at a minimum.  The problems and considerations described above are 
readily apparent when considering the packaging of devices 
for endoscopic surgery. The general background of 
endoscopic surgery is known and is described in 
US-A-5234445, which is incorporated herein by reference. A 
package for the type of suture loop and cannula disclosed 
therein is shown in US-A-5226535, which is also incorporated 
herein by reference. As explained therein, it is desirable 
to package the suture loop and cannula so that the loop is 
held in an open position and so that they can be readily 
removed from the package. It is also explained that these 
types of instruments are typically placed in a plastic 
overwrap envelope prior to sterilization, and that the 
package must therefore protect the overwrap from puncture. Currently, it is recommended practice that devices such 
as the suture loop and cannula described in these 
applications are inserted into

<CLAIMS>
A packaging system for an endoscopic instrument and an 
endoscopic introducer for said instrument comprising: 

   an instrument packaging having opposed sides and opposed 
ends adapted to contain an endoscopic instrument, a foldable 

packaging for retaining said introducer removably affixed to 
said instrument package, said foldable package comprising: 

   a central panel having longitudinal sides and lateral 
ends; 

   slits cut inward of the longitudinal sides to create 
longitudinal retainer flaps adapted to engage the sides of 

said instrument package; a forward extension portion 
comprising a proximal tab and an opening for receiving a 

distal end of the introducer when folded; and a rearward 
extension portion comprising an opening for receiving a 

proximal end of the introducer when folded. 
The packaging system of claim 1 in which the foldable 
package further comprises a central retainer comprising a 

split, raised portion formed by displacing a portion of the 
central panel. 
The packaging system of claim 1 in which the foldable 
package further comprises a slit cut inward of a lateral end 

to create a lateral retainer flap. 
The packaging system of claim 1 in which the foldable 
package further comprises a distal retainer flap formed by 

a slit cut in the rearward extension. 
The packaging system of claim 4 wherein the slit cut in 
the rearward extension defines the opening in the rearward 

extension. 
The packaging system of claim 1 wherein the forward 
extension portion further comprises an opening and at least 

one locking tab extending into the opening. 
The packaging system of claim 1 in which the foldable 
package further comprises at least one predetermined fold 

line formed by scoring. 
The packaging system of claim 1 wherein the foldable 
package is comprised of a paperboard material. 
The packaging system of claim 8, wherein the foldable 
package is comprised of suture board material having a 

thickness between about 0.008 90.20 mm) and 0.016 inches 
(0.41 mm). 
The packaging system of claim 1 further comprising an 
overwrap containing both the instrument package and the 

foldable package.
