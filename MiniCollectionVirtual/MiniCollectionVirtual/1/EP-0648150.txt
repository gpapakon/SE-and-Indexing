<ABSTRACT>
A process for coating a metal substrate for packaging end use comprises applying to a primary substrate a suitable, substantially solvent-free thermosettable composition. The composition is applied as a thermosettable film by extrusion in melt (including plastified) form through an extrusion coating die onto a substrate, and there is relative movement between the die and the substrate so that successive areas on the substrate are coated with the thermosettable composition, so as to form a film. The primary substrate is the metal substrate for packaging end use or an intermediate temporary support from which the applied coating is transferred onto the metal substrate for packaging end use, and the applied coating is thermally cured after extrusion through the extrusion coating die. Compositions suitable for use in this and other coating processes are described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for forming a
cured thermoset coating on a metal substrate for
packaging end uses, including packaging of liquid and dry
products, especially for use in the packaging (including
processing or holding) of foods and beverages. The
invention also relates to thermosettable compositions for
use in coating metal substrates for packaging end use.Currently, thermosetting protective and decorative
coatings are generally applied to metal strip or sheet
for packaging end uses by roller-coating of a solvent-based
lacquer (which may comprise water and a co-solvent)
typically comprising 30-60% by weight solids. After
application of the lacquer to the metal strip or sheet,
the solvent is removed by evaporation and the applied
coating is cured. For cost and environmental reasons,
it would be desirable to be able to reduce the usage of
organic solvents in the application of thermosetting
coatings, and the present invention is directed to that
objective.U.S. Patent Specification No. 4 990 364 describes
solvent-free, low monomer or monomer-free polymerisable
or curable compositions for use in coating various
classes of substrates, including metal substrates for
packaging end use. The compositions are indefinitely
stable under the conditions described and are
curable only by means of free-radical initiators in 
conjunction with heat treatment; by means of actinic
light, especially ultra-violet radiation; or by electron
radiation. There is no disclosure of thermally activated
crosslinkable systems.The present invention provides a process for coating
a metal substrate for packaging end use, which comprises
applying to a primary substrate a thermosettable (that is
to say, thermally crosslinkable/curable) composition
suitable for forming a coating for packaging end use,
wherein the thermosettable composition is substantially
solvent-free, the composition is applied as a thermosettable
film by extrusion in melt (including plastified)
form through an extrusion coating die onto a substrate,
there being relative movement between the die and the
substrate so that successive areas on the substrate are
coated with the thermosettable composition so as to form
a film, the primary substrate being the metal substrate
for packaging end use or an intermediate temporary
support from which the applied coating is transferred
onto the metal substrate for packaging end use, and the
'applied coating is thermally cured after extrusion
through the extrusion coating die, the thickness of the
