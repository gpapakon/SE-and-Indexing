<ABSTRACT>
An array of collinear coaxial lines (11, 13) utilizes standard size brass tubing (23c, 24c) with brass rods (23a, 24a) inserted therein to establish each half-wavelength coaxial section. A coupler (20) positioned between each half-wavelength section has outer conductor supports (20b, 20c) and through passages (20d, 20e) for the inner conductor. Inner conductors (23a, 24a) of the transmission line elements (23, 24) are soldered to the outer conductors (23c, 24c) of the respective adjacent transmission line elements so that all elements are excited with the same phase and polarity. Air dielectric between the inner and outer conductors provides a transmission line wavelength equal to that of free space so that the length of each element in the array is a free space half-wavelength long, thereby providing an antenna gain greater than that achievable with transmission lines having solid dielectric supporting the inner conductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the field array antennas and 
more particularly to an array of coaxial elements arranged 
in a linear alignment. A linear array of coaxial elements of the prior art 
comprises a plurality of coaxial cables, each having a solid 
dielectric between the inner and outer conductors, wherein 
the inner conductor of one cable is connected to the outer 
conductor of the succeeding cable. The wavelength of a wave 
propagating within a cable section is a function of the 
dielectric constant of the dielectric material and is given 
by λ/√ε, where is the free space wavelength and ε is the 
dielectric constant of dielectric material. Each section is 
one half a cable wavelength long. Since the dielectric on 
the outside of the cable is air, which has a dielectric 
constant that is less than that of the solid dielectric, the 
wavelength of a propagating wave in free space exceeds the 
cable wavelength. Consequently, each section is less than 
one half of a free space wavelength, the overall length 
being λ/2√ε. Such antennas are disclosed in the 1956 IRE 
National Convention Record, Vol 4, Part I; IEEE Transaction 
on Antennas And Propagation, July 1972; U.S. Patent 
3,031,668; and U.S. Patent 5,140,336. Patent Cooperation 
International Publication No. WO 82/04356 discloses a broad 
banded linear array of coaxial elements wherein the coaxial 
sections have bead supported inner conductors in an 
otherwise air dielectric line, while German Patent Application No. 
35 14 709 A1 discloses a linear array of coaxial elements 
that has the inner conductors of the coaxial elements 
supported at the element ends. Theoretical analyses of the 
linear array of coaxial elements are given in IEEE 
Transactions On Antennas And Propagation vol 37, No. 3, March 1989, pages 289-296, T. Juda SZ et al: "Improved Theoretical 
and Experimental Models for the Coaxial Colinear Antenna" and vol 39, No. 1, January 1991, pages 15-20, A. Sakitani et al: "Analysis of Coaxial 
Collinear Antenna: Recurrence Formula of Voltages and Admittances at Connections".  
 Performance of the above mentioned prior art coaxial 
collinear arrays is degraded by the dielectric loading in 
three ways: first, the current distribution over the 
element sections is not uniform; second, the dielectric is 
loss and contributes to antenna inefficiency; and third, the 
length per section is foreshortened, thereby adversely 
effecting the antenna gain. Further, the element sections 
are constructed of semi-rigid coaxial cable which must be 
cut
