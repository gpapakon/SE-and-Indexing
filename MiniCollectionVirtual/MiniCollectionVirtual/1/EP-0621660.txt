<ABSTRACT>
A signal conditioning insert device that is 
particularly suited for use as a small computer system 

interface (SCSI) terminator. The device is in the form of 
an elongated U-shaped member that is capable of being 

sandwiched between two electrical connectors. The 
substrate has a series of contact strips thereon which 

engage the contact fingers of the connectors. Conductive 
traces on the substrate connect the contact strips to 

components forming a desired signal condition function 
such as a SCSI terminator circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
There are several applications where it would be
desirable to add conditioning electronics to cabling used
in computer systems. For example, computer networks often
need special termination circuitry added to network
cabling at various connection points. By way of a non-limiting
example, the small computer system interface
(SCSI) is a defacto standard for connecting external
storage devices to a wide range of computer network
systems. One of the SCSI requirements is that each bus be
terminated on both ends with predetermined termination
circuitry. This circuitry is sometimes located internally
in the computer peripheral device. However, one of the
most common techniques is to use an external terminator
pack that is physically located at the first and last
device in the SCSI network. While a variety of terminator
packs and techniques for providing SCSI termination are
used, one construction consists of a relatively bulky
piece of hardware that encloses some electronics on a 
printed circuit board which, in turn, has two mating connectors on it so that it can be
added in series with a SCSI cable.There are several drawbacks to these techniques for incorporating
conditioning devices into electrical systems, in general, and for providing SCSI
termination, in particular. The large number of individual and extraneous
components used in the prior art methods tend to unduly increase production and
distribution costs, as well as taking up valuable space. Many of the terminator packs
require an additional set of mating connectors to allow the signals therein to pass
through the network. These additional connectors do not provide any significant
circuit function; yet they can degrade the radio frequency shielding of the network
cables.US-A-5181859 discloses an electrical connector semiconductor wafer having
holes corresponding to the pins of the connector. The circuitry on the wafer can be
used to modify signals carried by the pins. However, the wafer is not suitable for an
SCSI environment.Therefore, there exists a need for a simple, low cost, yet reliable technique
for conditioning signals on electrical cables and, in particular, to provide a SCSI bus
terminator with these improved characteristics.The present invention broadly provides a device that generally conforms in
shape to electrical connectors of the type having a series of contact fingers which
either surround a central elongated insulating post or define inner walls of a
receptacle cavity. Centronix (TM) brand connectors are one example of connectors
