<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for the fastening of a cutting insert in a blade holder (1),
in particular inserts for the turning of grooves and parting (3), which are limited along

their upper sides (20) by a clamp (5). On the upper side of the said clamp (20) a recess is
arranged to receive a tensioning roller (6), which is intended to press the upper side of

the insert and clamp the insert firmly. This makes possible an effective clamping
without any wear between the clamp and insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clamping device for a cutting insert, in
particular for an insert for the turning of grooves and parting, in accordance with the preamble
of claim 1, and as known from DE-A-3 319 799.Cutting inserts for, for example, grooving and parting are clamped in
holders of the blade type, in order to achieve narrow widths of cut. Further, the term
"blade type" also includes slitting cutters and circular saw blades.In US-A-4 801 224 a clamping device for a cutting insert in a holder of
blade type is described, including a cutting insert which can be clamped in a slot in the
blade. The cutting insert is clamped by the spring action which is created by deflection
of a clamping finger which is an integral part of the holder. In order to press the cutting
insert into its correct position in the slot, a special installation tool is used which
consists of a rod with two pins in the one end surface. Admittedly this device functions
satisfactorily but it nevertheless suffers from certain drawbacks. For example, the fact
that the cutting insert itself forces the spring clamp finger upwards each time a cutting
insert is mounted, causing a certain wear of the contact surfaces of the clamping finger
which works against the cutting insert, which over a longer period damages the said
contact surface, such that the cutting insert no longer sits with the same stability which it
had at the beginning. Therefore the entire the blade holder must be exchanged.Also in US-A-4 588 333 a clamping device in a blade holder is described,
according to which the cutting insert is clamped in a slot by spring action which is
created by the deflection of a clamping finger which is integrated into the blade holder.
According to this design the cutting insert is pressed into the insert pocket by the
operator, by pushing the end surface of a hard rod or bar against the front part of the
cutting insert. In a manner similar to that in US-A-4 801 224 the cutting insert is then
prized out by applying one of the two pins on the said rod behind the cutting insert and
levering it out. Even with this design the contact surface of the holder, which acts
against the cutting insert, wears each time a cutting insert is inserted or extracted.
Further, even in this case, there is the inconvenience that the installation tool requires
space.In EP-A-259 847 a blade holder with a slot for receiving the cutting insert
is described, plus an additional slot for the mounting of a clamping screw, which when
activated forces the blade
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for the fastening of a cutting insert (4) in a blade holder
(1), in particular for the turning of grooves and parting, wherein the blade holder (1), comprises a slot (3), which

receives said insert (4), the slot (3) being limited along its upper side (20) by a clamp (5), and at its
rear end by a contact surface (8), th
e said clamp (5) on said upper side (20), features a recess
(14) which accommodates a tensioning roller (6), 
characterized in,
 that said tensioning
roller (6), acts directly on the upper surface of said insert (4) and is provided so that when

the roller (6) is rotated so that the peripheral surface nearest the insert (4) moves in a direction
towards said rear contact surface (8) the insert (4) is brought into distinct contact with the rear

surface (8) and the roller (6) also presseds against the upper side of the insert (4) hence
clamping the insert against the lower surface of the slot (10).
An arrangement according to claim 1. whereby a tension roller (6) and a
recess (14) are shaped with matching male and female parts which fix the roller (6) in the

axial direction.
An arrangement according to claims 1 and 2, whereby the tensioning
roller (6) incorporates a planar surface (12), which makes possible the introduction of the

roller (6) into the recess (14) plus the free movement of the insert relative to the roller (6) when
installing the insert in the slot (3).
An arrangement according to any of the previous claims, whereby the
tensioning roller (6) shows a rib which runs centrally around the side surfaces of the double

conical part (fig. 10), a substantially V-shaped groove (fig 11), which runs centrally, or a
groove with a shape matching the segment of a circle (24), which runs centrally.
An arrangement according to any of the previous claims, whereby the
tension roller shows a surface part formed by the side walls of the conical parts with

increasing radius in order to make possible step free increase of the clamping force
against the insert (4).
A method for the fastening of an insert in a blade holder using an arrangement as claimed in claim 1,
(20), characterized in that when said roller is rotated so that its lower peripheral surface

moves towards the rear contact surface (8) a force is exerted on the insert which first
pushes the insert into distinct contact with the rear surface (8) and secondly clamps the

insert against the lower surface of the slot (10). 
A method according to claim 6, whereby the tensioning roller (6),
incorporates along the side walls of the conical sections a planar surface (12), which is

directed towards the upper side of the insert (4) when the insert is pushed into the slot (3),
under which circumstances a gap exists between the roller (6) and the insert (4), after which the

roller (6) is rotated so that the planar surface is directed in another direction and instead a
part of the rollers round sides of the conical parts are brought to press against the upper

surface of the insert (4), thus a force is exerted on the insert (4) which first pushes the insert (4)
into distinct contact with the rear surface (8) and secondly clamps the insert (4) against the

lower surface of the slot (10).
