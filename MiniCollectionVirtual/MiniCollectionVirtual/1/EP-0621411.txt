<ABSTRACT>
The roller is made of a plastics material reinforced with a mat or web of fibres. It is constructed with trunnions (1) at both closed end faces and it has a hollow, fibre-reinforced body (2) comprising adjacent sections (3,4,5) bonded together. The bending stiffness of each of the sections (3,4,5) increases towards the roller (2) centre.

<CLAIMS>
A fibre-reinforced and coreless plastic roller 
supported on end-face bearing journals, and having a hollow-cylindrical 

roller body, characterized in that the roller 
body (2) consists of at least three partial bodies (3, 4, 5) 

which are adjacent to one another in the direction of the 
longitudinal axis and are joined together, and in that the 

partial bodies (3, 4, 5) are arranged adjacently in such a 
way that their bending strengths increase from the end faces 

in the direction towards the middle of the roller body (2). 
A plastic roller according to claim 1, characterized 
in that all partial bodies (3,4, 5) have essentially the 

same wall thickness (5) and are joined together by bushes 
(6) overlapping the joints on the inner side. 
A plastic roller according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the bushes (6) and the partial bodies (3, 4, 5) are 

bonded. 
A plastic roller according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the partial bodies (3, 5) adjoining 

the end-face ends consist of a plastic with a lower bending 
strength than the partial body (4) arranged in the middle. 
A plastic roller according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that at least the partial body (4) arranged 

in the middle is reinforced by a fibre structure (7) 
embedded in the plastic. 
A plastic roller according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the fibre structure (7) consists of fibre strands 

(8) extending essentially parallel to one another, and in 
that the fibre strands are embedded in the plastic in the 

manner of a thread turn. 
A plastic roller according to claim 6, characterized  
 

in that the fibre strands (8) enclose an angle (1) of from 
0 to 45Â° with the longitudinal axis of the partial bodies. 
A plastic roller according to any of claims 6 to 7, 
characterized in that fibre strands (8) crossing one another 

are provided in the plastic. 
A plastic roller according to any of claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that the partial body or partial bodies (4) 

arranged in the middle are reinforced by fibres to a 
comparatively greater extent than the partial bodies (3, 5) 

adjoining the end-face ends.
