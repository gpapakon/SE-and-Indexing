<ABSTRACT>
In order, in a printing machine for the continuous printing of a recording medium (1) with labels or a corresponding division into portions, to make it possible to extract individual printed labels easily, a holder (7) having at least one detector (14, 15) can be mounted removably on the printing machine. The printed recording medium (1) runs through a region between the two detectors, and these can detect read-off marks made on the recording medium. As soon as a read-off mark comes into the coverage of the at least one detector (14, 15), the latter can stop the drive for the advance of the recording medium immediately or after a predetermined timespan has elapsed. It is now possible for the foremost printed label to be removed easily.

<CLAIMS>
A printing apparatus with a tape-shaped recording medium (1) 
adapted to be fed through a printing zone (2) by means of a controllable 

driving mechanism, wherein the recording medium (1) carries labels for 
printing or is separable into sections of equal size, and includes reading 

marks in particular spaced from each other by the relative distance of the 
labels or sections, and wherein there is provided, in the exit area (5) of the 

printing apparatus (3), at least one detecting means (14, 15) for the labels or 
sections in particular for the reading marks on the recording medium (1), 

which detecting means operates to stop the driving mechanism of the 
recording medium (1) when the presence of a label or section, in particular a 

reading mark, is established within its detection zone, 
characterized in that
 
the detecting means (14, 15) is secured to a detachable mounting structure 

(7), and that an electrical connection is established between the printing 
apparatus (3) and the mounting structure (7) and the at least one detecting 

means (14, 15) by means of an electric cable (16) having a plug at its one 
end for connection to an appropriate socket on the printing apparatus (3). 
The printing apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the mounting structure (7) includes two detecting means (14, 15) of 
which one is situated at a location above, and the other below, the printed 

recording medium (1).  
 
The printing apparatus as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
 at least one of the detecting means (14, 15) is a reflex sensor 
incorporating a transmitter and a receiver, while the other detecting means, if 

any, is only a receiver. 
The printing apparatus as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in 
that
 a detecting means (14, 15) each is provided at a location above and 
below the printing zone (2) in relative opposite arrangement. 
The printing apparatus as claimed in at least one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the mounting structure (7) includes 
at least two transverse beams (8, 9) and at least one longitudinal beam (10, 

11), with one transverse beam (8, 9) each being provided at a location 
above and below the exit area (5) of the printing apparatus (3). 
The printing apparatus as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in 
that
 at least one cable conduit (21, 22, 23) each is provided in the 
transverse beams (8, 9) and the at least one longitudinal beam (10, 11). 
The printing apparatus as claimed in at least one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 a receiving means (30) for an 
anchor plate (13) is provided on the printing apparatus (3), in particular at a 

location below the exit area (5) for the recording medium (1), and that one 
longitudinal beam (10, 11) each is releasably attachable to the two lateral 

ends of the anchor plate (13).  
 
The printing apparatus as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized in 
that
 the receiving means (30) is comprised of a housing groove narrowing in 
an outward direction preferably in steps, said groove being adapted to 

receive slidably therein the anchor plate (13) from at least one end wall of 
the printing apparatus. 
The printing apparatus as claimed in at least one of the 
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 each detecting means (14, 15) is 
mounted on a small supporting plate (17), and that each transverse beam (8, 

9) of the mounting structure (7) receiving one detecting means (14, 15) 
includes a slot-shaped receiving means (18) for the small supporting plate 

(17), the length (19) of said receiving means corresponding to the length of 
the supporting plate as seen when looking in the longitudinal direction of the 

transverse beam (8, 9), while its height corresponds to the thickness of the 
supporting plate. 
The printing apparatus as claimed in claim 9, 
characterized in 
that
 the height of the slot is enlarged (20) to either side in the area of the 
ends of the supporting plate.
