<ABSTRACT>
The color determination circuit 308 detects hue of 
the color image information, and the controller 205 

decides a color component to be separated (separation 
color) in accordance with the detected hue. Output 

color by the printer 204 is set in correspondence with 
the separation color. The two-color-separating circuit 

303 separates the color image information into image 
information on at least two color components in 

accordance with the decided separation colors. The 
separated image information on the each color is 

transmitted to the printer 204 via printer density 
correction circuits 304 and 305, and a buffer 306. 

Thereby it is possible to provide an image processing 
apparatus capable of setting and changing the separation 

color and the output color by automatic operation or by 
simple manual operation, thus the expression of the 

image forming can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing method and apparatus capable of separating a
plurality of colors from a color image signal and, more
particularly, to a digital copy machine which separates
red component and black component, for instance, from
the read color image signal, then forms an image by
expressing the red component with red color and the
black component with black color.A technique suggested according to USSN 07/671,450
is, for a digital copy machine, to read a color original
image by using a photoelectric converting element, such
as a color CCD, and to discriminate an area in
accordance with color information on the original image,
then to express the discriminated area with a color
which differs from a color representing the rest area
(red and black, for instance).Further, there is suggested a technique disclosed
to separates a red component and a black component, for
instance, from the read color image signal, then
expresses the original image by using two colors which
differ from each other. For example, the image is
formed by using a red color for the red component and a
black color for the black component. An image forming apparatus, which forms an image by
discriminating areas and expressing the areas with
colors which differ from each other, is able to express
a red character with red color in a case where the red
character is included in a part of an original image
which includes black-and-white. However, the apparatus
is not suitable to express a full-color image since it
forms an image by expressing each area with red color or
black color.Further, there are problems with an image forming
apparatus which separates two color components from a
full-color image and then expresses the image with two
colors differing from each other, as described below.
(1) Colors for separation can not be designated or
changed, since color components being separated from an
original are limited to predetermined two colors;(2) Colors for separation and colors for output
can not be designated or changed freely, since the
colors for separation and colors for output of image
data which is separated in accordance with the colors
for separation are limited to predetermined two colors
for the entire image;(3) If quality for expressing an image is to be
improved by designating and changing colors for
separation and colors for output of image data which is
separated in accordance with the colors of separation, 
since more items needs to be designated, the operation
of the apparatus becomes

<CLAIMS>
An image processing apparatus for supplying image
information to an image forming apparatus which forms

a two-color image on a recording medium using two color
recording materials, said image processing apparatus

characterised in that:

detecting means (302) for detecting a color
character of a color image of an original;
deciding means (205) for deciding a color component
to be separated from color image information related to

the original in correspondence with the detected color
character, wherein the color component corresponds to one

of the color recording materials to be used by said image
forming apparatus;
separating means (303) for separating two-color
component data from the color image information inputted

based on the decided color component; and
output means (304, 305, 306) for outputting the two-color
component data to said image forming apparatus.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
separating means separates the two-color component data

from the input color image information by performing a
linear operation using predetermined angle data.
Apparatus according to claim 1 of 2, wherein the 
two-color component data includes black component data.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the image forming forms a two-color image on a

recording medium based on the two-color component data.
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
further comprising a scanner for generating the color

image information which has red, green and blue
components by scanning the original.
An image processing method for supplying image
information to an image forming apparatus which forms a

two-color image on a recording medium using two color
recording materials, said method characterised by:


detecting a color character of a color image of an
original;
deciding a color component to be separated from
color image information related to the original in

correspondence with the detected color character, wherein
the color component corresponds to one of the color

recording materials used by the image forming apparatus;
