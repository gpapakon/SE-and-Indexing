<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for manufacturing objects from thermoplastic material by injection moulding, using an extruder (10), which is provided with a screw, and an injection mould (28). In this case, the material stored in a first storage space (17) is initially moved in the direction of the injection mould (28) for filling the same and, after filling of the injection mould, a holding pressure is maintained on the thermoplastic material located in the said injection mould in order to compensate for material shrinkages occurring during cooling, use being made of at least a second storage space (30), from which a piston (32) attempts to displace thermoplastic material in the direction of the injection mould (28). The volume of the second storage space (30) can be altered during the emptying of the first storage space (17) by correspondingly displacing the piston (32) assigned to the second storage space (30), in order to make the filling of the injection mould proceed at a rate which is independent of the rate at which the first storage space (17) is being emptied.
