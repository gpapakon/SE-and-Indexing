<ABSTRACT>
An envelope flap up pick and place apparatus and 
method uses an envelope delivery spider (41) which has 

been adapted to deliver envelopes (7) to a belt conveyor 
(44), in a position with the folded envelope seal flaps 

facing upward. A rotary guide (50) is positioned with 
radially extending guide members (51) extending just 

above the conveyor belt to guide envelopes onto the 
conveyor in an upright orientation. The conveyor moves 

the envelopes toward a series of three separately 
movable, vertically oriented finger supports. The three 

supports are cooperatively driven to accumulate and 
compress horizontal stacks of predetermined numbers of 

envelopes which are then positioned beneath a gripper 
assembly with a pair of opposed gripper arms. The 

gripper assembly is lowered into a position in which the 
gripper arms are inserted on either side of the envelope 

stack, pulled together and pivoted inward at the bottoms 
to squeeze the stack from the bottom edges. The 

assembly is then lifted to pick up the stack from the 
conveyor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic envelope 
processing apparatus and method, and, more particularly, to 
such an apparatus which removes completed envelopes from an 
envelope folding machine, maneuvers them such that their 
folded-down top seal flap is placed upward, and deposits 
them in a horizontal stack on a receiving surface. A pair 
of cooperating movable supports then compresses individual 
stacks, each containing a predetermined number of envelopes, 
and positions them for a mechanical grasper to grasp the 
compressed stacks, lift them without bottom support and move 
them to another location for a further operation, such as 
packaging. Envelope manufacturing in general has increasingly 
become a highly automated operation. In the production of 
standard and specialty envelopes, large, complex machines 
serve to fold blanks, apply patches, and place adhesive on 
the side and and top or seal flaps. The side flaps are 
folded over and sealed and the finished envelopes are 
normally output via a delivery spider into a horizontal 
stack on a surface, such as a conveyor belt, to be 
accumulated into stacks of envelopes for other operations, 
such as loading into cartons.  
 These accumulating and loading steps have been 
difficult to fully automate, using requiring hand 
operations. In the past, conventional delivery spiders have 
fed the finished envelopes onto the delivery surface with 
the folded seal flap facing downward. As these envelopes 
with downward facing folded seal flaps accumulate on the 
receiving surface, the cumulative outward acting horizontal 
spring effect caused by the extra paper layers in the 
downward facing folded seal flaps tends to spread or expand 
the envelope stack longitudinally outward at the bottom. No 
gripping or picking machine is known which is capable of 
reliably automatically picking up the requisite number of 
envelopes from the horizontal stack and moving them away 
from the stacking area without dropping them. This is due 
to the "spring" action of the extra paper layers represented 
by the folded, open seal flaps which tends to bow the 
envelope stack outward at the bottom edges, causing 
envelopes in the middle of the stack to bulge downwardly and 
drop out, usually followed by the remainder of the stack. U.S. Patent No. 3,537,362 to Harper describes a typical 
prior art flap downward envelope placement method and thereto 
an apparatus according to the preamble of Claim 1. As a result of this inability to design a suitable 
machine, and as

<CLAIMS>
An envelope transfer and accumulating apparatus 
(31,44), comprising: 


(a) a series of interacting rollers (32-36), 
each with an associated envelope retainer for 

gripping envelopes (7), with the last roller 
(36) in the series turning in a direction 

which propels said envelopes individually in 
a downward direction,seal flap first, open 

and folded; 
(b) a delivery spider (41) with a plurality 
of curved envelope slots (42) in said 

delivery spider, said delivery spider being 
adapted and positioned to receive, on a first 

side of said delivery spider, a series of 
envelopes from said last roller (36), with 

each said received envelope entering a 
respective upward facing one of said slots; 
(c) a conveyor (44) for accumulating 
horizontal stacks of said envelopes;
 
   characterized in : 
(d) a limit stop (43) which causes said 
envelopes to drop out of said curved slots 

and onto said conveyor, the envelopes being 
dropped onto said conveyor from a second side 

of said delivery spider which is opposite to 
the first side such that the envelopes are  

 
dropped onto the conveyor with their seal 

flaps facing upward; namely with the outside 
of the fold of said seal flaps facing upward. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
delivery spider (41) rotates in a direction 

opposite to said last roller (36). 
An apparatus as claimed in claims 1 or 2, wherein 
said limit stop comprises a generally horizontally 

oriented member (43). 
An apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein said conveyor comprises a horizontal belt 

(44), and the apparatus further comprises a rotary 
guide (52) which guides said envelopes onto said 

conveyor in an upright orientation with the 
envelope seal flaps facing upward, said rotary 

guide comprising a plurality of radially extending 
guide members (53). 
A method of delivering envelopes (7) from a stream 
of said envelopes to a conveyor (44) with folded 

envelopes seal flaps facing upward, the method 
comprising the steps of: 


(a) directing said envelopes via a roller 
(36) in a downward direction seal flap first 

open and folded;  
 
(b) receiving said envelopes in individual 
envelope slots (42) in a delivery spider 

(41), said delivery spider being oriented 
such that openings of said slots are 

positioned facing upward to receive envelopes 
exiting said roller; 
(c) rotating said delivery spider (41) in a 
direction opposite from said roller (36); and 
(d) causing said envelopes to drop out of 
said delivery spider (41) on a side of said 

delivery spider (41) which is opposite to 
said roller (36) such that said envelopes 

drop out of said delivery spider (41) and 
onto said conveyor (44) in an upright 

position with said folded seal flaps facing 
upward. 
A method according to claim 5, and further 
comprising the step of: 


(a) guiding said envelopes onto said 
conveyor (44) in said upright position via a 

rotary guide (52) positioned adjacent said 
delivery spider (41), said rotary guide (52) 

including a plurality of radially directed 
guide members (53) adapted to receive 

individual envelopes therebetween and to 
direct said envelopes onto said conveyor (44) 

in an upright orientation such that said  
 

envelopes accumulate in a horizontal stack 

with their seal flaps facing upward. 
A method according to claims 5 or 6, and wherein 
said causing step comprises using a generally 

horizontally oriented limit stop (43) to drop said 
envelopes out of said delivery spider (41).
