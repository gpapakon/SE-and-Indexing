alkenyl or, together with the carbon atoms to which they are bound form a
3 to 6 membered carbocyclic ring, containing 1, 2 oder 3 double bonds;

characterized in that the compound of the general formula 1 is present in
an amount of 0,1 to 50 % by weight based on the total solution and

contains a noble metal ion in an amount of 0,01 mg/kg to 1 g/kg of the
compound of the general fomula 1.
The solution according to claim 1, characterized in that Y is hydrogen or
(C
1
-C
18
) alkyl.
The solution according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that each R and R
1

independently is hydrogen or halogen. 
The solution according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that an
ion of ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, silver

or gold is used as noble metal ion.
The solution according to any of the claims 1 to 4, characterized in that it
contains 5-chloro-2-methyl-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-methylisothiazolin-3-one

in a ratio of (1 to 10) : 1.
Use of the solution according to any of the claims 1 to 5 as a microbiocide
agent for the use in technical systems, wherein microorganisms may grow.
