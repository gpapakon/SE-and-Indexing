<ABSTRACT>
The breaking structure for a circuit breaker according to the invention comprises, for each pole, a contact bridge (17) housed in a pusher (20). The pusher is guided in a fixed cage (21) monted in the casing of the circuit breaker, the cage being provided with windows (24) for the contact bridge and with a high stop (26) for the bridge , so as to form a telescopic sub-assembly.

A circuit breaker comprising, in a box (10)
and for each pole, a cutoff structure (S) comprising a

cage (21) having windows (24) for the passage of a
mobile contact bridge (17) associated with fixed

contacts (13, 14), said windows (24) enabling
dispacement of the contact bridge (17) under the effect

of a mechanism for opening and closing the contacts and
in the case of electrodynamic repulsion, and a push

button (20) subjected to said mechanism and guided by
said cage (21) said push button (20) acting upon the

contact bridge (17) against a contact presure spring
(28), characterized in that an independent cutoff

structure (S) is provided for each pole, and in that
each cage (21) is fixed with respect to the case (10)

and comprises lateral isolating wings (38) disposed so
as to delimit a volume containing the interruption

arcs.
The circuit breaker as claimed in claim 1,
characterized by the fact that said fixed cage (21) has

a stop (26) for said contact bridge (17) in the
direction corresponding to the springing back of said

spring (28).
The circuit breaker as claimed in either claim
1 or 2, characterized by the fact that said push button

(20) bears said contact bridge (17) and comprises at
least one port (32) dimensioned to allow introduction

of said contact bridge (17) into said push button (20)
and an angular clearance of said bridge (17) in

relation to said push button (20).
The circuit breaker a claimed in claim 1,
characterized by the fact that said insulating wings

(38) are embraced by open areas of finned arc
extinguishing assemblies (37). 
The structure as claimed in one of claims 1 to
4, characterized by the fact that said fixed cage (21)

comprises a base wall (22) positioned on the base (18)
of said box (10).
The structure as claimed in claim 5,
characterized by the fact that there is provided.

between said base wall (22) of said cage (21) and said
base (18) of the box (10), a flat deflector (25)

connecting the cutoff chambers (36, 37) to one another.
The structure as claimed in one of claims 1 to
6, characterized by the fact that the material of said

fixed cage (21) differs from that of the neighbouring
areas of said box (10) of said circuit breaker.
