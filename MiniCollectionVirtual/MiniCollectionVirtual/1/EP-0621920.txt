<ABSTRACT>
A cooled turbine blade (1) has a shroud segment (2) in which three cooling air branch channels (4, 14, 15) are susbstantially perpendicularly arranged with respect to the longitudinal axis of the blade and in the circumferential direction of the shrouding of the blade. Cooling air bores (7, 9) which open at the surface of the shroud segmets (7, 9), forming there film cooling holes (8, 10), branch off from the cooling air branch channels (4, 14, 15). Cooling air is supplied to a first branch channel (4) by a blade cooling channel (3) located in the blow area, whereas a second branch channel (14) is coupled to another blade cooling channel (13) and the third branch channel (15) is coupled to the second branch channel (14).

<CLAIMS>
A turbine blade of a gas turbine with at least one cooling-air channel (3) 
running in the blade (1) and with a shroud segment (2) arranged at the tip 

of the blade, which together with other segments on adjacent blades forms 
a blade strengthening band, with further on the pressure side of the blade 

(2) and essentially vertical to the axis of the blade, a cooling-air branch 
channel (4) joined to the blade cooling-air channel (3) in the pressure side of 

the blade, from which several cooling-air borings (7) lead to the surface of 
the shroud segment (2), and a further cooling branch channel (14) running 

within the shroud segment (2) which is joined to a blade cooling channel 
(13) in the centre of the blade or on the downstream side of the blade, from 

which similarly cooling-air borings (9) lead to the surface of the blade 
segment (2),
 
characterised in that at least one further parallel branch channel (15) is 

provided, running essentially parallel to the cooling branch channel (14), 
which is joined to the cooling branch channel (14) via several cooling-air 

borings (9). 
A turbine blade in accordance with Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the branch channels (4, 14, 15) are oriented essentially 

in the direction of the enclosing blade strengthening band and are closed at 
both end sides of the shroud segment (2). 
A turbine blade in accordance with one of the preceding claims,
 
characterised in that the cooling-air borings (7, 9) run essentially vertical to 

the axis of the blades and extend from the surface of the shroud segment 
(2) to a branch channel (4, 15) or extend beyond it. 
A turbine blade according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that the parallel branch channel (15) lies in the blade's 

downstream region.
