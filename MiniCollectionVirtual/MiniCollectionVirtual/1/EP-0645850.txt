<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ignition device for an internal combustion engine, comprising at least one elbowed bushing (duct) (5) arranged to receive a lateral snap-on cable (7) end connector (8). It comprises a stop (6), offset with respect to the axis of the end of the bushing, for allowing the cable connector to be snapped on in a first, fitting-on, angular position of the connector with respect to the bushing, and for preventing it from being disconnected in a second, use, angular position.

<CLAIMS>
Ignition member of an internal combustion engine, comprising 
at least one bent output sleeve (5) arranged to receive a 

connector (8) for the end of a cable (7), which is engaged 
laterally, characterised by the fact that it comprises a stop 

(6), offset with respect to the axis of the end of the sleeve, 
to allow the engagement of the cable connector in a first angular 

position, for positioning the latter with respect to the sleeve 
and to prevent its disconnection in a second angular position of 

use. 
Ignition member according to Claim 1, comprising retaining 
means (9) for retaining, during use, the end of the cable in its 

second angular position. 
Ignition member according to Claim 2, in which the retaining 
means comprise a cover mounted on the body of the member.
