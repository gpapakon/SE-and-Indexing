<ABSTRACT>
In an electronic appliance equipped with an electronic 
wristwatch equipped with a sensor (22, 26), a trend in 

various variations such as temperatures, altitude and 
waterdepths can be visually and intuitively recognized. In 

the electronic appliance, measurement data constructed of 
plural digits are acquired in response to output signals 

from the sensor (22, 26). The upper digit data among the 
plural digits of measurement data are digitally displayed 

by way of an electronic/optical digital display unit (2), 
e.g., an LCD display, whereas the lower digit data among 

the plural digits of measurement data except for the plural 
digits are displayed by way of either a pointer type 

display unit, or an electronic/optical analog display unit, 
e.g., a meter (3, 4, 5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to an electronic appliance equipped
with various sensors for acquiring various measurement data and for
displaying these measurements.Conventionally, various electronic wristwatches have been developed
which are equipped with a sensor to display not only time data, but
also atmospheric pressure data, water-depth data or temperature data.
Such a wrist watch is known from US 4,835,716 in which the wristwatch
displays an altitude and a water-depth by a display section for
displaying time. The display section comprises a digital display
section including a main digital display section having six digits and
a sub-digital display section having four digits and an analog display
section. The analog display section has a circular form which is
divided into three rings, each having sixty rod-like display members
in a radial direction. To make a difference in altitude or water
depth visible in an analog way, the display members of the two inner
rings are used to display the present altitude or water depth, whereas
the display members of the outmost ring are used to display a preset
altitude or water depth. US 3,696,610 also discloses a wristwatch for
displaying the various diving data in an analog form by rotating a
pointer.There are also display devices known from US 4,242,980 (abstract; fig. 1; col. 2-5) , which comprise an analog and a
digital display portion. EP 0 447 580 discloses a combined analog and
digital display for displaying a number having digits behind the
decimal point. These digits are displayed in an analog manner by
display members which are arranged along a straight line for
displaying two digits by two different kinds of display members. Said
straight line of display elements is additionally provided with at
least one tab which can be moved linearly along said straight line of
display elements and each of said tabs comprise a light sensitive 
element adapted to provide a signal when the display element nearest
to said tab is illuminated.In EP 0 373 982, measurement data display means are described which
comprise a scale having marks arranged in a circular manner, at least
one movable pointer realized by liquid crystal display members and
digital digit displays for scaling the graduation of the scale
according to the displayed measurement data.Conventional wristwatches own inherent drawbacks. In case of the
digital display mode, it is difficult to intuitively grasp changing
degrees in the digitally displayed values. In case of the digital
display mode, such a
