<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to airers and driers for 
clothes and the like which have been washed. A well 
known type of airer to which the invention relates 
comprises a plurality of arms which support a clothes 
line extending in a plurality of parallel paths between 
the arms. The arms may be radial, extending outwardly 
from a central pole and in this case it is convenient to 
use a single length of line wound from arm to arm. Thus 
if three arms are employed, the line may extend as a 
series of triangles of successively larger size, or the 
line may form the equivalent of a spiral passing from a 
point on one arm to a point at a slightly larger radial 
distance from the pole on the next arm and so on, 
although the spiral is made of a series of angularly 
related straight line portions rather than being a 
continuous arc. The line must support the weight of wet washing, but 
the line tension must not be high since it is usual to 
make the arms to fold or collapse to a bundle for 
storage, and too much tension may make the airer 
difficult to erect. Often the line is tied to one of the 
arms at one point in each triangle or like shape and is 
merely engaged with the other arms. Many different arrangements or systems have been 
proposed for the engagement. In simpler designs the line 
is threaded through diametrical holes in the arms and 
periodically knotted. This makes adjustment necessary if 
the line stretches in repeated use tedious or difficult 
One arrangement in widespread use involves moulded 
plastic cleats which are riveted to the arms along their 
length at appropriate spacing and the line is simply 
wound about those cleats. The object of the invention is 
to simplify the airer construction. According to the invention, an airer comprises a 
plurality of arms each provided with a plurality of 
cleats for engaging a washing line portion, and is  
 
characterised in that the cleats are engaged in holes in 
the arms. Preferably the cleats are snap-engaged or are a 
push-fit i.e. frictionally engaged in the arms, without 
needing any separate attachment means. Hence the 
riveting step which was necessary in the prior art is 
avoided. The cleat of the invention may be a plastics 
moulding and a material of suitable slight deformability 
and or resilience is preferred so as to provide secure 
anchorage of the cleats either by friction as a push-fit 
or by snap-engagement where a head or projection from the 
cleat is deformed during assembly and recovers to hold 
the cleat in position. Preferably the

<CLAIMS>
An airer comprising a plurality of arms each 
provided with a plurality of cleats for anchoring a 

washing line portion and characterised in that the cleats 
are engaged in holes in the arms. 
An airer as claimed in Claim 1 wherein each cleat 
has a shank which is frictionally engaged in a hole in 

the arm. 
An airer as claimed in Claim 1 wherein each cleat 
has a shank which is a push-fit and is snap-engaged in a 

hole in the arm. 
An airer as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
the cleats are plastics mouldings of a material of slight 

deformability . 
An airer as claimed in Claim 4 wherein each cleat 
comprises a shank provided with a head or projection 

arranged to be deformed during insertion into the hole in 
the arm and to recover to hold the cleat in position. 
An airer as claimed in any preceding claim wherein 
the arms are of tubular metal apertured diametrically, 

each cleat comprises a peg dimensioned to pass through 
aligned apertures with a head at one end and a line 

receiving notch at the other end. 
An airer as claimed in Claim 6 wherein a plurality 
of notches is provided. 
An airer as claimed in Claim 4 and Claim 6 wherein 
the notch comprises a slot extending along the shank and 

a laterally opening jaw, arranged to be flexed when the 
line is passed through the jaw into the slot, so that the 

line is gripped at a plurality of points about its 
periphery. 
An airer substantially as described with reference 
to the accompanying drawing.
