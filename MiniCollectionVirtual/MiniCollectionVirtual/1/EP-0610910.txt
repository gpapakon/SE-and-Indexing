<ABSTRACT>
A beam spot detector is disposed on an extension of a 
surface to be scanned by a beam of light. The beam spot 

detector has a mask in front thereof, the mask having a side 
which the beam of light intersects perpendicularly and a side 

which the beam of light intersects obliquely. An output 
signal of the detector is differentiated at a differentiating 

circuit, and positive and negative peak values are held at a 
peak hold circuit. A CPU calculates diameters of the beam of 

light in both a main scanning direction and an auxiliary 
scanning direction from the peak values. If the beam of 

light is out of focus, then the CPU outputs adjustment 
signals. A counter calculates a width of the output signal 

of the beam spot detector and outputs the calculated width to 
a CPU. The CPU compares the received width with a reference 

to detect a displacement in the auxiliary scanning direction 
(displacement of registration) and outputs a correction 

signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scanning optical 
systems that scan a surface to be scanned by injecting a beam 
of light thereto from a light source through a deflector and 
a lens system. More particularly, the present invention is 
directed to a scanning optical system having a correcting 
function that is designed to detect a displacement from the 
focus of an image forming spot of a beam of light which is on 
the surface to be scanned, the displacement being 
attributable to changes in ambient conditions such as 
temperature. Recording apparatuses using scanning optical systems 
are widely used in recent years. Examples are laser beam 
printers, which modulate a laser beam source in accordance 
with an image signal, cyclically deflect a laser beam from 
the modulated laser beam source with a deflector, converge 
the laser beam in spot form on a photosensitive recording 
medium with a lens system, and make a recording of an image 
by exposing the image through scanning. In such conventional laser beam printers, a problem 
has been encountered. That is, changes in ambient 
temperature cause thermal deformation of components  
 
constituting the lens system, and as a result, the laser beam 
converging position on the photosensitive body is displaced, 
thus causing impairment of image quality. To overcome this problem, e.g., Japanese Patent 
Unexamined Publication No. Hei 2-73212 discloses a system in 
which focus adjustment is made by disposing a plurality of 
detectors, each having an opening in a direction parallel 
with a scanning direction, at positions optically equivalent 
to a surface to be scanned and by comparing or calculating 
signals from detecting sections thereof. However, the above-mentioned conventional system uses 
a plurality of light beam detectors, and this construction 
addresses the problem of requiring not only a large 
installation space but also a large cost.  
 US-5,105,296 discloses a method and apparatus for 
detecting the shape of a beam spot on a scanning plane in a 
scanning optical system having a constant scanning speed. 
When a relative moving speed of the light beam is not known 
before hand, four slits are used to detect intensities of 
light passing through the slits. Three of these slits have 
different angles of inclination with respect to a scanning 
direction, and the remaining slit has the same angle of 
inclination as one of the three slits. When the moving speed 
of the light beam is known in advance, the first mentioned 
three slits are used. The moving
