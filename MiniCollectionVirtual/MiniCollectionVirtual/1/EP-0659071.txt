<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention Is related to shampoo compositions. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to mild, 
substantially colorless shampoos, especially those that are useful 
for application to the hair. Mild shampoo compositions which provide low irritation to the 
skin are highly desirable. Conventional shampoos contain high 
levels of harsh anionic surfactants. These surfactants can 
provide excellent lathering and cleaning characteristics. However, 
they can also penetrate the skin and destroy its integrity. 
This results, at the very least, in rough and/or dry skin, and can 
ultimately lead to red, irritated skin. Ideal shampoo compositions 
should provide sufficient lathering and cleaning benefits to 
cleanse the hair while at the same time causing little or no 
irritation to the skin. This is particularly essential for 
shampoo compositions used on babies, small children, or adults 
with dry or sensitive skin. Mild shampoo compositions, in general, are well known in the 
art having been taught in, for example,

US-A-4,329,334, Su et al., issued May 11, 1982. These  
 
references teach the use of a wide variety of surfactant combinations 
to achieve mildness. These surfactants include mild anionic 
surfactants, such as ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, amphoteric 
surfactants, nonionic surfactants, and various combinations 
thereof. In addition to the physical effect harsh shampoos can have on 
the skin, consumers are also influenced by aesthetic factors 
relating to the shampoo. For example, high lathering is 
associated with good cleaning. Also, clear and colorless products 
are associated with purity and mildness. It would be highly 
desirable to provide a mild shampoo which is both clear and 
colorless, and which can provide high levels of lather upon use. Unfortunately, the formulation of mild shampoos is generally 
an exercise in trade-offs and compromises. Mild shampoos
