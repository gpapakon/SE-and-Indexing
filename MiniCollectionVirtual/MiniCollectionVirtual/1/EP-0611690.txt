<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steering column assembly unit (10), especially for a motor vehicle, of the type including a steering shaft (16) mounted so that it can rotate in a column body (12) made in two parts (13, 14) which are mounted telescopically, one inside the other, and a device (46-58) for immobilising the two parts (13, 14) of the steering column body (12) in a relative position, which device can be released in the event of impact (shock) on the vehicle in order to allow the steering wheel to retract forwards, characterised in that the immobilising device includes an operating member (52) connected to an inertia mechanism (58) which, in the event of impact, acts on the operating member (52) in order to bring about the release of the immobilising device.

Steering column unit (10) having an adjustable position, in 
particular for a motor vehicle, of the type comprising a steering 

shaft (16) mounted to rotate in a column body (12) in two parts 
(13, 14) which are mounted telescopically one in the other and 

a device (46-58) for locking in a relative position the two 
parts (13, 14) of the steering column body (12), characterised 

in that the locking device (46-58) is able to be released in the 
case of impact on the vehicle in order to allow the forwards 

retraction of the steering wheel, said locking device comprising 
a control member (52) connected to an inertia mechanism (58) 

which, in the case of impact, acts on the control member (52) to 
cause the release of the locking device. 
Steering column bit according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the inertia mechanism comprises an inertia weight (58) 

sensitive to the deceleration of the vehicle which is connected 
mechanically to the control member (52) of the locking device. 
Steering column unit according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the control member (52) is a control lever mounted to tilt 

about an axis (X-X) substantially perpendicular to the 
longitudinal direction of forwards movement of the vehicle and 

whereof a point (56) remote from its tilting axis (X-X) is 
connected to the inertia weight (58). 
Steering column unit according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the inertia weight (58) is fixed to the free end (56) of the 

control lever (52). 
Steering column unit according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that the control member (52) is a locking member able to be 

operated manually for adjusting the longitudinal position of the 
steering wheel. 
Steering column unit according to one of the preceding Claims,  
 

characterised in that the locking device has a structure (30) for 
supporting the steering column, connected to the remainder of the 

structure of the vehicle and comprising two cheeks between which 
the column body (13, 14) is disposed and means for locking in an 

adjusted position, the two parts (13, 14) of the steering column 
body by moving the cheeks closer together, comprising a tie-rod 

(38) extending between the cheeks (32), a first end (40) of which 
comprisies means (42) for resting on one of the cheeks and a 

second end (44) of which is connected to locking members 
comprising a atop member (46) at the second end of the tie-rod, 

an intermediate support member (48) in contact with the other 
cheek (32) of the support structure (31) and able to move axially 

on the tie-rod (38) disposed between the stop member (46) and the 
intermediate support member (48) and able to move between an 

active locking position and a retracted release position.
