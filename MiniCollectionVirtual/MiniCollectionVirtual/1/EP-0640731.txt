<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a canvas-roll-type awning, in the case of which the canvas roll is fixed by means of its non-extensible end in that loops 11 are formed on its border edge by means of a hollow seam. Passing through said hollow seam is a weather strip 14, which is inserted into the loop 11 and is received therewith in a weather-strip groove 13 which extends along the bearing shaft of the canvas roll, in the axial direction of the same. The cross-section of the weather strip 14 is of an approximately S-shaped configuration and has a short, relatively thick lower leg 16 and a relatively thin and relatively long upper leg 15 running approximately parallel to said lower leg 16. In this state, when the canvas is subjected to tensile stress, the weather strip cannot be removed from the weather-strip groove. It would have to be pivoted in the opposite direction, with the awning canvas in the loosened state, in order to be able to remove it easily from the weather-strip groove with the end of the awning canvas. This permits easy accessibility from the front, which facilitates the effort of installing and removing the canvas roll to a considerable extent.

<CLAIMS>
Cloth roll awning with an awning cloth (9) capable of unwinding from and 
winding onto a cloth roll (7) together with a wall- or ceiling-mountable 

awning box (2, 8) to accommodate the cloth roll (7) on the tubular bearing 

shaft (12), the tubular bearing shaft (12) being supported at its ends, 
whereby, when the cloth roll (7) is fully wound, the front cloth end (10) is 

flexibly fixed to a front bar (18) stretching along the width of the awning, 
and the inner, non-extendible end of the awning cloth (9) is fixed by 

means of an end loop (11) extending across the width of the cloth roll (7) 
and enveloping an anchor (14) located in an anchor groove (13) running 

along the axis of the bearing shaft (12),
characterized in that
the anchor (14) is a profiled bar with an approximately S-shaped 
cross-section and whose upper and lower arms (15, 16) are of 

different lengths and run parallel to each other, 
and which may be inserted by its shorter, lower arm 16) into the 
anchor groove (26) through the outer slot (17), 
and that the slanting middle section (19) of the anchor (14) as well as 
the relating acute angle of the long upper arm (15) of the anchor (14) 

are matched to the width of the outer slot (17) such that the long 
upper arm (15) engages like a hook with the anchor groove (13) 

under the tension exerted by the awning cloth (9) pulling in the same 
direction. 
Cloth roll awning according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 
   the upper, long arm (15) is less thick than the lower, short arm (16). 
Cloth roll awning according to Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that
 
   the rear anchor loop (11) has a circumferential length of between one 

and two times the circumferential length of one side (27) of the 
anchor (14). 
Cloth roll awning according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that
 
   the upper, long arm (15) narrows in the direction of the awning cloth 

(9). 
Cloth roll awning according to Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 
   under the load exerted by the cloth roll (7), the anchor (14) with its 

enveloping loop (11) is tensioned and, via portions of the envelope, 
makes contact at several points with the inner wall (28) of the anchor 

groove (13). 
Cloth roll awning according to Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that
 
   the parts contacting the inner wall (28) of the anchor groove (13) via 

the awning cloth (9) have a thickness of about half to less than one 
times that of the neck opening of the outer slot (17).
