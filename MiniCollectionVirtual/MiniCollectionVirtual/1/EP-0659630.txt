<ABSTRACT>
A steering apparatus for an automotive vehicle having a 
steering mechanism (A) arranged to steer a set of dirigible 

road wheels (21, 22) in accordance with a steering effort 
applied to a steering wheel (10), wherein the steering 

mechanism (A) is designed to preliminarily bias the road 
wheels (21, 22) leftward or rightward a condition where the 

steering wheel (10) is placed in a neutral position for 
straight travel of the vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steering apparatus
for automotive vehicles, according to the preamble of the
enclosed patent claim 1.Disclosed for example in Japanese Utility Model Laid-open Publication
Hei No. 1-144170 or in the EP 0053666 is a steering apparatus of the rack-and-pinion
type for an automotive vehicle which includes a
tubular housing mounted on the vehicle body to support a
rack member displaceably in a lateral direction, a pair of
tie rods swingably connected to the opposite ends of the
rack member to steer a set of dirigible road wheels in
accordance with lateral displacement of the rack member,
and a pair of dust boots fixedly coupled at their one ends
with the opposite ends of the tubular housing and at their
other ends with the tie rods to encompass each joint portion
of the tie rods with the rack member.In such a conventional steering apparatus as described
above, the steering characteristic is symmetrized in left 
and right directions to maintain the steering wheel in a
neutral position even if the driver causes the vehicle to
travel on a flat road without holding the steering wheel.
In general, the surface of the flat road is, however,
raised at a central portion of the road for drainage.
Accordingly, if the driver causes the vehicle to travel on
the flat road without holding the steering wheel placed in
the neutral position, the steering wheel will be displaced
leftward or rightward from the neutral position in accordance
with lateral inclination of the road surface. As a
result, straight travel of the vehicle may not be maintained.
In the case that the road wheels of the vehicle
are equipped with radial tires for traveling on a left or
right lane of the travel road, a ply-steer residual cornering
force caused by the tires themselves acts to restrain
the lateral displacement of the vehicle. If the ply-steer
residual cornering force is large in excess, the vehicle
tends to travel in an opposite direction against the lateral
inclination of the road surface. Furthermore, the document WO-A-810 34 72 discloses a
steering apparatus having a steering mechanism arranged to
steer a set of wheels in accordance with a steering effort
applied to a steering wheel, wherein the steering
mechanism comprises two helically wound spring elements
for preliminarily biasing the road wheels in a
predetermined lateral direction in a condition where the
steering wheel is placed in a neutral position for
straight travel of the vehicle.With such a steering mechanism the straight running
characteristic
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A steering apparatus for an automotive vehicle comprising
a steering mechanism (A) for steering a set of road wheels

(21, 22) on a road surface, the steering mechanism (A)
including a tubular housing (31) mounted on a body structure

of the vehicle to support a rack member (33) displaceable in
a lateral direction, and first and second tie rods (36, 37),

said first tie rod (36) being connected to one end of the
rack member (33), said second tie rod (37) 
being connected to
the opposite end of the rack member (33), a first dust boot

(38) being coupled at one end to said first tie rod (36) and
at the other end to said tubular housing (31), and a second

dust boot (39) being coupled at one end to said second tie
rod (37) and at the other end to said tubular housing (31),

   
characterized in that

   said dust boots (38, 39) are adapted as biasing means
biasing the set of road wheels in a predetermined lateral

direction when a steering wheel is retained in a neutral
position by applying a pre-load force which is predetermined

by taking into account a lateral inclination of the road
surface and a ply-steer residual cornering force of tires on

the road surface. 
A steering apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
first dust boot (38) is stretched by a first selected amount

and fixed in place, said first selected amount corresponding
to a first pre-load force (F1); and said second dust boot (39) is

compressed by a second selected amount and fixed in place,
said second selected amount corresponding to a second pre-load

force (F2).
