<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to glasses essentially free
from lead displaying the physical characteristics of lead-containing
crystal glasses.Among the glasses used for the aesthetics or
decoration of the table, crystal occupies an exceptional
place: its brightness, its density, and its sonority make
it a much esteemed material. In addition, it exhibits the
characteristics of formability at moderate temperatures, of
having a long working range, and of being able to be easily
cut and polished.Traditionally these properties are achieved by the
presence of lead oxide in the glass composition. But lead
is a toxic, and nowadays is considered problematical for
handling, manufacturing and use, especially the latter, as
lead in the glass can migrate into food in contact with the
glass, and lead poisoning, particularly after contact with
an acid medium, for example, fruit juices or alcohol.Strengthening safety concerns create a need for 
glasses without lead but having the properties and
manufacturing cost similar to those of lead crystal.The present invention solves the problem by lead free
glasses suitable for use as tableware and/or decorative
crystal glassware meeting the following requirements:
(1) a glass density of at least 2.9 g/cm3;(2) an index of refraction of at least 1.545;(3) the glass displays a pleasant sonority;(4) the glass exhibits a moderate linear coefficient
of thermal expansion (lower than 100x10-7/0C
between 0°-300°C) in order not to be too sensitive
to thermal shock;(5) the viscosity of the glass at high temperature is
close to that of crystal; the temperature at
which the glass exhibits a viscosity of 10 Pa.s
(100 poises) does not exceed 1470°C; and(6) the viscosity of the glass at the liquidus
temperature is greater than 600 Pa.s (6000
poises).More precisely, the invention relates to glasses
essentially free from lead (no lead additions to the batch,
except as incidental batch impurities) having the following
compositions, expressed in terms of weight percent on the
oxide basis.
