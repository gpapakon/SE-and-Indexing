<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic material comprising a 
support having thereon a silver halide emulsion layer which 

comprises a hydrazine compound having at least one absorbent 
group to silver halide, wherein two nitrogen atoms of the 

hydrazine compound are substituted by four substituents and 
the carbon atoms in the four substituents bonded directly to 

the two nitrogen atoms are not substituted by an oxo group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic material having a high sensitivity and an
excellent storage stability.The present invention also relates to a
compound containing a hydrazine structure.Silver halide photographic materials have hitherto
been demanded to have a high sensitivity. In particular,
spectrally sensitized silver halide photographic materials
have keenly demanded to have a high sensitivity.The spectral sensitization is a very important and
essential technique in the production of a light-sensitive
material having a high sensitivity and an excellent color
reproducibility. The spectral sensitizer has a function to
absorb light in a long wavelength region where the silver
halide photographic emulsion inherently does not absorb light
in a substantial sense and to transmit the light absorption
energy to the silver halide. The increased amount of light
captured by the spectral sensitizer is advantageous to enhance
the photographic sensitivity. Accordingly, it has been
attempted to increase the captured light amount by increasing
the amount of the spectral sensitizer added to a silver halide 
emulsion. However, if the spectral sensitizer is added to a
silver halide emulsion in an amount exceeding the optimum
range, the sensitivity is, on the contrary, greatly reduced.
This is generally called as dye desensitization and is a
phenomenon that desensitization occurs in the region to which
the silver halide is inherently light-sensitive and where the
sensitizing dye absorbs substantially no light. If the dye
desensitization is large, the spectral sensitization effect
may be provided but overall sensitivity is reduced. In other
words, with the reduction in dye desensitization, the
sensitivity in the region where the sensitizing dye absorbs
light (namely, spectral sensitivity) increases correspondingly.
Therefore, the improvement in dye desensitization is
a great subject in the spectral sensitization technique. The
dye desensitization is larger as the sensitizing dye has its
light-sensitive region at a longer wavelength. This is
described in T.H. James, The Theory of the Photographic
Process, pp. 265-268 (Macmillan, 1966).Further, as described in T. Tani et al, Journal of
the Physical Chemistry, Vol. 94, p. 1298 (1990), sensitizing
dyes having a reduction potential more noble than -1.25 V are
known to provide a low relative quantum yield in spectral
sensitization. In order to increase the relative quantum
yield of such a dye in spectral sensitization, super-sensitization
