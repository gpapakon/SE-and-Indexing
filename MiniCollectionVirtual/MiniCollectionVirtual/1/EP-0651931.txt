<ABSTRACT>
An imaging system employs a photoconductive material capable of bearing a latent photostatic image, a plurality of elongated parallel stripes adjacent the photoconductive material, selective scanning of the stripes to produce charge carriers within the photoconductive material, and time-ordered detection of the current created by the charge carriers with the plurality of elongated parallel stripes. Appropriate addressing of the stripes as they are scanned produces a pixellated representation of the latent image. The system has improved output signal strength and higher resolution than known systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMAGING SYSTEM HAVING OPTIMIZED ELECTRODE GEOMETRY AND PROCESSINGTechnical Field This invention relates to systems for producing images, and especially those systems which use photoconductive materials to absorb radiation to create a latent image, followed by a selective detection of the latent image in the photoconductive material.Background One type of imaging system employs photoconductive materials to absorb incident radiation representative of an image of an object. Suitable photoconductive materials will absorb the radiation and produce electron-hole pairs (charge carriers) which may be separated from each other by an electric field applied across the photoconductor, creating a latent image at the surface of the photoconductor (which is typically a thin planar layer). A narrow beam of scanning radiation substantially completes discharge of the photoconductor, by creating motion of a second set of charge carriers. The distribution of these second charge carriers in the plane of the photoconductor is affected by the distribution of the first charge carriers, i.e., by the latent image. The motion of the second charge carriers is detected and digitized in an appropriate circuit, and thus the latent image is captured in digital form. In one specific embodiment, the photoconductor is part of a multilayer structure comprising two electrodes, between which are the photoconductive layer and an insulating layer. A high voltage power supply maintains electric fields in the structure during exposures to the incident radiation and the scanning radiation (although not necessarily the same field strength is present during each exposure). An example of this type of system is taught in U.S. Patent 4,176,275 (Korn et al.). Application of the electric field across the photoconductive layer can be assisted by establishing a prior (reverse) field across the insulating layer, as taught in U.S. Patent 4,539,591 (Zermeno et al.).A second and closely related approach, known as the air-gap photoinduced discharge (PID) method, employs air as the insulating layer, and requires that a uniform separation be maintained between the two electrodes, typically by high-precision mechanical or piezoelectric devices. A corona charges the surface 

of the photoconductor prior to exposure to radiation, producing an electric field in the material. Thus, the incident radiation partially discharges the surface to produce a latent image, and the read-out signal is induced by the charge motion under the influence of the residual electric

<CLAIMS>
We claim:
1. A system for producing an image created by radiation incident upon an imaging device, comprising:
(a) an imaging device comprising a first conductive layer, an insulative material, a photoconductive insulative layer, an electrically blocking layer, and a second conductive layer which consists essentially of a segmented array of at least one group of elongated, striped, conductive electrodes lying in a first direction;
(b) means for creating an electric field between the first and second conductive layers such that first charge carriers are created in the imaging device by first incident radiation, and subsequently separated to create a first cunent, resulting in the formation of a latent electrostatic image near the interface between the insulative material and the photoconductive insulative layers;
(c) a scanner which, in a first time-ordered pattern, utilizes a second incident radiation to initiate a second cunent, comprising second charge carriers, within the imaging device; and
(d) detection electronics connected to, and sensitive to motion of the second charge carriers in, each electrode;
in which:
(e) the scanner scans the array in a second direction substantially different from the first direction; (f) each conductive electrode is addressed in a second, time-ordered pattern such that only one electrode in a group is monitored for motion of the charge carriers at one time, while adjacent electrodes in that group are held at a voltage level representing a virtual ground as measured relative to the monitored electrode, and the detection electronics interprets a coincidence of the first and second patterns as a pixel of the image created by the radiation, which pixel represents a conesponding portion of the latent image. 


 2. The system of claim 1 in which the first and second directions are substantially perpendicular to each other.
3. The system of claim 1 in which the insulative material is fluid at the operating temperature of the system.
4. The system of claim 3 in which the fluid insulative material is gaseous.

6. The system of claim 1 in which the insulative material is a layer of material which is non-fluid at the operating temperature of the system.
7. The system of claim 1 in which the first conductive layer and the insulative material are each semi-transparent, and the second radiation is incident upon first conductive layer prior to incidence upon the insulative material, which is still prior to incidence upon the photoconductive insulative layer.
8. The system of claim 1 in which the electrodes of the second conductive layer are semitransparent, and the second radiation energizes the imaging device through the anay of conductive electrodes prior to being absorbed in the photoconductive insulative layer.
9. The system of claim 1 in which more than one pixel of the electrostatic image is produced in a single stripe of the anay, as measured in the second direction, by means of an intensity-modulated laser.
10. The system of claim 1 in which the second radiation is a continuous laser.
11. The system of claim 1 in which the first and second radiations have substantially different wavelengths.
12. The system of claim 1 in which the first and second radiations have substantially similar wavelengths. 


 13. The system of claim 1 in which the first radiation is x-ray radiation and each electrode has a width of approximately 10 to 200 microns.
14. The system of claim 1 in which the second radiation is ultraviolet, visible, or infrared radiation.
15. The system of claim 1 in which each electrode has a width substantially less than the thickness of the photoconductive insulative layer.
16. The system of claim 1 in which the width of the electrodes is less than a conesponding dimension of a pixel.
17. The system of claim 1 in which all electrodes are interconnected in a pattern permitting multiplexing of the output of the electrodes into a signal having as many channels as there are groups of electrodes.
18. The system of claim 1 in which the coincidence of the first and second patterns is established from an electronic signal which is due to charge carrier motion as detected by an electrode of the segmented array.
