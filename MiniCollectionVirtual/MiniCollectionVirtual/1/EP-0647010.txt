<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems 
for reducing or eliminating the cogging torque (or reluctance torque) 
in electric motors with permanent magnets, in 
particular in brushless motors, by acting on the 
shape and on the arrangement of the magnets. Motors with permanent magnets are subject 
to a cogging torque which determines an oscillation 
of the torque produced by the motor itself and 
which is due to the periodical interactions 
between the magnetic field in the air gap created 
by the inductor (in this case by the permanent 
magnets) and to the non-uniformity of the 
permeance of the magnetic circuit of the armature 
framework or stator which is typically provided 
with channels or slots for housing the windings. 
In practice, the cogging torque is due to the 
fact that the stored magnetic energy in the air 
gap varies according to the angle defined by the 
position of the rotor relative to the stator. It will be appreciated that since 
cogging torque is undesirable, designers of 
brushless motors have devised systems for reducing 
it. The method conventionally adopted is that of 
disrupting the periodicity of the magnetic field:  
 
this can be brought about by rendering the slots 
in the armature framework oblique along the 
principal axis of rotation of the motor 
(staggering the laminations constituting the 
armature with respect to one another) or varying 
the width or spacing of the permanent magnets or 
of the slots. Methods of this type, even though 
they are efficient in reducing the cogging 
torque, have the disadvantage that they also 
reduce the torque produced by the motor and 
increase the production cost of the motor. Motors which adopt methods, according to the prior 
art, for reducing the cogging torque are disclosed, for instance, 
in EP-A-0 169 569, FR-A-7 810 574, EP-A-0 502 831. The object of the present invention is to 
provide a motor with permanent magnets having 
reduced or no cogging torque whilst having a 
similar cost and complexity to motors produced 
according to the prior art. In accordance with the present invention, 
there is provided a 
motor with permanent magnets, 
comprising an inductor having permanent magnet 
means which can generate an angular distribution 
of magnetic poles ; an armature separated 
from the inductor by an air gap and having 
a plurality of slots or channels facing the 
air gap ; 
characterized in that the permanent magnet means
