<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a multi-layer polyester preform and container, particularly suitable for refillable PET carbonated beverage bottles, having an interior layer (30) of high copolymer polyester material which resists hazing in the preform injection stage, and at least one exterior layer (32, 34) of a polyester to achieve enhanced strain-induced crystallization in the exterior layer during blow molding. The container can withstand higher caustic wash temperatures and exhibits reduced flavor carryover from one product to another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new and useful
improvements in containers, and more particularly to
a method of forming a container having an enhanced
level of surface sidewall crystallinity, while
maintaining a high level of transparency (clarity).
The container is particularly useful as a refillable
carbonated beverage container, able to withstand high
caustic wash temperatures and exhibit reduced product
flavor carryover and as a hot-fill container.The market for PET refillable carbonated
soft drink (CSD) bottles has enjoyed significant
growth worldwide since its introduction in 1987 by
Continental PET Technologies. These bottles have
been commercialized throughout much of Europe,
Central and South America, and are now moving into
the Far East market. Refillable bottles reduce the existing
landfill and recycle problems associated with
disposable plastic beverage bottles. In addition, a
refillable bottle provides a safer, lighter-weight
plastic container in those markets, currently
dominated by glass, where legislation prohibits use
of non-returnable packages. The goal is to produce
a refillable bottle having the necessary physical
characteristics to withstand numerous refill cycles,
and which is still economical to produce.Generally, a refillable plastic bottle must
maintain its functional and aesthetic features over
a minimum of 10 and preferably over 20 cycles or
loops to be considered economically feasible. A
loop is comprised of (1) an empty hot caustic wash
followed by (2) contaminant inspection and product
filling/capping, (3) warehouse storage, (4)
distribution to wholesale and retail locations and
(5) purchase, use and empty storage by the consumer
followed by eventual return to the bottler. This
cycle is illustrated in Fig. 1. In an alternative
cycle, the contaminant inspection occurs before the
caustic wash.Refillable containers must meet several key
performance criteria to achieve commercial viability,
including:
1. high clarity (transparency) to permit
visual on-line inspection; 2. dimensional stability over the life of the
container; and3. resistance to caustic wash induced stress
cracking and leakage.A commercially successful PET refillable
CSD container is presently being distributed by The
Coca-Cola Company in Europe (hereinafter "the prior
art container"). This container is formed of a
single layer of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
copolymer having 3-5% comonomer, such as
1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) or isophthalic acid
(IPA). The preform, from which this bottle is
stretch blow
