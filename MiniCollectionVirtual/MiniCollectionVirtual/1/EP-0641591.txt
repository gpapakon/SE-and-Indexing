<ABSTRACT>
A single bed, air separation PSA system utilizes 
an external product surge tank to supply product oxygen 

and purge gas to the adsorbent bed. An equalization 
tank supplies void space gas to the bed for 

repressurization purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention - This invention relates to pressure swing adsorption systems for air separation. More particularly,
it relates to the use of a single bed pressure swing adsorption system for the low volume recovery of oxygen from
air.Description of the Prior Art - The pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process and system provides a commercially
attractive approach for separating and purifying at least one component of a feed gas mixture containing at least one
less readily adsorbable component and at least one more readily adsorbable component. Adsorption occurs in an
adsorbent bed at an upper adsorption pressure, with the more readily adsorbable component thereafter being desorbed
from the adsorbent bed by reducing the adsorbent bed pressure to a lower desorption pressure. The carrying out of the
adsorption/desorption PSA process is well known and is disclosed, for example, in US-A-3 430 418, relating to PSA
systems having four or more beds. As disclosed in this patent, the PSA process is commonly carried out, on a cyclic
basis, in a processing sequence that includes, in each bed, (1) pressure adsorption, with feed gas being introduced to
the feed end of the bed and with release of the less readily adsorbable component, as product gas, from the product
end of the bed; (2) cocurrent depressurization to intermediate pressure with release of void space gas from the product
end of the bed; (3) countercurrent depressurization to a lower desorption pressure, with release of the more readily
adsorbable component from the feed end of the bed, (4) optional purge at the lower desorption pressure, with purge
gas being passed to the product end of the bed to enhance removal of the more readily adsorbable component, desorbed
from the adsorbent bed, from the feed end of the bed; and (5) repressurization from the lower desorption pressure
to the upper adsorption pressure, so that the cycle can be repeated with additional quantities of feed gas being
passed to the bed. The void gas released during the cocurrent depressurization step is commonly employed for pressure
equalization purposes between beds in the multi-bed system and to provide purge gas to a bed at its lower desorption
pressure. Variations of such processing sequence are employed in the art for use in systems containing one or
more adsorbent beds.In numerous chemical processing refinery, metal production and other industrial applications, high purity gas
streams are frequently employed for a variety of purposes. For example, high purity oxygen is used

<CLAIMS>
A pressure swing adsorption process for the low volume recovery of oxygen from air, comprising:

(a) passing feed air to the feed end of a single bed of adsorbent material capable of selectively adsorbing nitrogen,
as the more adsorbable component of air, the pressure in the bed increasing from a first intermediate

pressure to an upper adsorption pressure, with oxygen, as the less adsorbable component of air, passing from
the product end of the bed to a product surge tank at pressures approaching said upper adsorption pressure;
(b) cocurrently depressurizing the bed from said upper adsorption pressure to a second intermediate pressure which is higher than the first intermediate
pressure with the release of void space gas from the product end of the bed, said void space gas passing

to an equalization tank;
(c) countercurrently depressurizing the bed from the second intermediate pressure to a lower desorption pressure,
with the release of additional quantities of gas from the feed end of the bed;
(d) passing a side stream of product gas from the product surge tank to the product end of the bed as purge
gas to displace desorbed nitrogen from the void volume in the bed at the lower desorption pressure, the displaced

desorbed nitrogen being discharged from the feed end of the bed
with no void space gas from the equalization tank being passed to the product end of the bed; between

steps (c) and (e)
(e) introducing void space gas from said equalization tank to the product end of the bed to increase the pressure
in the bed from the lower desorption pressure to said first intermediate pressure; and
(f) passing additional quantities of feed air to the feed end of said single bed as cyclic operation of steps (a)-(e)
is continued,

whereby product oxygen is recovered from air. 
The process of Claim 1 in which said lower desorption pressure is a subatmospheric pressure.
The process of Claim 2 in which the upper adsorption pressure is above atmospheric pressure, and said first intermediate
pressure is below atmospheric pressure.
The process of Claim 1 in which the adsorbent material comprises zeolitic molecular sieve material.
The process of Claim 1 and including passing a small quantity of product gas from the product surge tank to the
product end of the bed following the introduction of void space gas thereto in step (e), thereby increasing the average

purity of oxygen in the void space of the bed.
