<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel silicone-modified
acrylic copolymer having a polyorganosiloxane
with an SiH reaction point on a side chain thereof, and
to an adhesive comprising the above copolymer as a chief
component.Patients who need a denture and, particularly, a
full denture, in many cases, are aged persons, and their
alveolar ridges must bear an increased occlusion force
per unit area since the bone has generally been
resorbed to a conspicuous degree. The mucosa of
alveolar ridges becomes thin due to senile atrophy, and
the occlusal stress or masticatory pressure is not
softened but is directly transmitted to the alveolar
bone. Moreover, a thin mucosa disposed between a hard
resin denture base and the hard alveolar bone is
tightened and gets hurt after every occlusion, and
begins to feel pain.In such a serious case, the resin denture base
molded by using a methyl methacrylate resin (acrylic
resin) that is usually used is not sufficient for stably
maintaining the mastication and supporting the adhesion
of the denture. That is, it is necessary to reline the
mucosa surface of the resin denture base with a soft
dental relining material to compensate the lost
viscoelasticity of the mucosa of the residual alveolar
ridge, in order to impart cushioning property that
softens the occlusal stress. That is, the object of
relining with a soft material is to overcome various
troubles when the thin mucosa is compressed by the hard 
denture base.Examples of relatively excellent soft relining
materials include room temperature-curing silicone
rubbers that are cured at room temperature of not higher
than 50°C and low temperature-curing silicone rubbers
that cure at temperatures of from about 50 to about
150°C.However, the silicone rubber-type relining
materials are defective with respect to adhesiveness to
the denture base. Therefore, several adhesives have
heretofore been developed for adhering a silicone rubber
material which is the relining material to an acrylic
resin which is the denture base. For instance, there
have been developed a silicone-modified acrylic resin
using a copolymer of an alkyl (meth)acrylate and a
dimethyl vinyl silylalkyl ester of (methy)acrylic acid
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 43209/1990)
and a silicone-modified acrylic resin using a copolymer
of an alkyl (meth)acrylate and a dimethyl hydrogen
silylalkyl ester of (meth)acrylic acid (Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No. 68007/1992).That is, solutions in which the above resins are
dissolved are applied onto the
