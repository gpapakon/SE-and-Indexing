<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a liquid-crystal display device comprising first display electrodes (31-48) and a set of second elongate display electrodes (50-56) formed on a first substrate (11;250), and a set of elongate backing electrodes (counterelectrodes) (70-129;300-359) formed on a second substrate (10;251) and superposed on the said second display electrodes (50-56) so as to create a matrix display of display elements. The said backing electrodes (70-129; 300-359) are juxtaposed substantially along their entire length. The distance separating the said adjacent backing electrodes (70-129;300-359) from one another is distinctly smaller than the width of the said first display electrode (31-48). At least one of the said backing electrodes (70-129;300-359) is superposed on the said first display electrode (31-48) so as to display a fixed display symbol.

Display device comprising :

a first substrate (11;250) and a second
substrate (10;251) spaced apart and facing each other,
a liquid crystal film switchable between two
states which are optically perceptible, said film being

enclosed in the space delimited by said first and second
substrates (10,11; 250,251),
at least a first display electrode (31-48) in
the form of a fixed symbol formed on the face of said

first substrate (11;250) which faces said second
substrate (10;251),
a set of second elongated display electrodes
(50-56) formed on the face of said first substrate

(11;250) facing said second substrate (10;251), these
second electrodes (50-56) being juxtaposed on said first

substrate (11;250) in a first general direction across
substantially the entire length of the first substrate

(11;250), and
a set of elongated counter-electrodes (70-129;
300-359) formed on the face of the second substrate

(10;251) facing the first substrate (11;250), these
counter-electrodes (70-129; 300-359) being juxtaposed on

said second substrate (10;251) in a second general
direction perpendicular to the first general direction

across substantially the entire width of said second
substrate (10;251) and superposed with said second

display electrodes (50-56) so as to create a matrix of
display elements for forming changeable display symbols

so as to be capable of displaying therewith symbols which
are changeable by selective application of a switching

voltage therebetween, said counter-electrodes (70-129;
300-359) being also superposed with the or with each

first display electrode (31-48), 
characterized in that
 at
least two counter-electrodes of the set of counter-electrodes

(70-129; 300-359) are superposed with said at
least one first display electrode (31-48) so as to create 

a fixed display symbol when a switching voltage is
applied therebetween, the distance separating one another

those of the adjacent counter-electrodes of the set of
counter-electrodes (70-129; 300-359) which are superposed

with said at least one first display electrode (31-48)
being substantially less than the width of said first

display electrode (31-48) and 
in that
 said counter-electrodes
(70-129; 300-359) are parallel to each other

in each of the regions defined by the first (31-45) and
second (50-56) display electrodes.
Display device according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 said counter-electrodes (70-129;
300-389) are divided into a plurality of spaced-apart

groups, each group intended to display an individual
changeable display symbol, said set of counter-electrodes

(70-129; 300-359) further comprising at least a second
counter-electrode part (746, 796, 896) connected to a

second adjacent counter-electrode, said second counter-electrode
part being positioned in the space between

adjacent groups of second counter-electrodes, said second
display counter-electrode thus forming part of said first

counter-electrode.
Display device according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 it further comprises :

at least a third display electrode (12-30)
formed on the face of said first substrate (11;250)

facing said second substrate (10;251), said counter
electrodes being superposed with said third display

electrode so as to create a fixed display symbol when
said switching voltage is applied therebetween, said

first and said third display electrodes (31-48; 12-30)
being positioned on opposing lateral sides of said set of

second display electrodes (70-129; 300-359).
