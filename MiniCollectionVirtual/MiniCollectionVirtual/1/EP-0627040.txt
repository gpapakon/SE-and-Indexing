<ABSTRACT>
When drilling in soil and simultaneous loading of casing tube it is desirable to be able to use casing tubes of plastic material such as PEH-plastic. This is made possible by a special design of a casing shoe (5) giving a strong joint between the casing shoe (5) and the casing tube (4). The casing shoe is made of metal and has a part (62) which is perforated of holes (63) filled with the plastic material. Tube couplings (12A, 12B) between the casing tubes can also be joined to the tubes (4A, 4B) in the same way as the casing shoe, i.e. that they are made of metal and each has one part (12A, 12B) perforated of holes (63A, 63B) filled with the plastic material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method for overburden
drilling with simultaneous loading of casing tube, a casing
shoe and a casing tube for the method and a coupling element
for casing tubes designed to be used with the method.When drilling in soil, a central pilot drill bit is used
together with a reamer drill bit so arranged that it can be
thrown out eccentrically in relation to the pilot drill bit
and expand the hole drilled by it. Thereby the bore will be
of a dimension enough to give place not only for the pilot
drill bit with the reamer drill bit in its inner position but
also for a casing tube brought down in the hole at the same
time as the hole is drilled. The casing tube is driven
downwards with the drill bit through a casing shoe welded to
the end of the casing tube and influenced by the percussive
drill hammer. The casing tubes usually consist of three
meters in length of steel welded together as drilling and the
tube is driven downwards to a suitabel extent.One problem when dealing with the casing tubes is their
weight. One further problem is the possibility of corrosion,
which in some cases causes the exchange of them to plastic
tubes after the drilling, a circumstantial and laborious
procedure.One object of the present invention is to eliminate the
exchange of casing tubes and one further object is to
facilitate the handling of casing tubes during drilling.
These and other objects are fulfilled by using casing tubes
of plastic material from the beginning, which in turn
according to the invention is made possible by a special
design of the casing shoe and of coupling elements for the
casing tubes giving a strong anchoring in the plastic
material. Further advantageous design details appear from the
claims and the detailed description.Still one further object of the present invention is to
achieve a joint of the casing tubes of plastic material in a
simple way. This can be done by joining metal elements to the 
ends of the casing tubes in the some way as the casing shoe,
the metal elements supporting tube couplings, for example of
the threaded type.The invention will now be described more in detail referring
to the drawing, in which
Fig.1shows schematic and partly broken through an
example of a known design of the parts at the drill
bit of a machinery for simoultaneous drilling and
casing of the bore.Fig.2 and 3shows partly in section the design of a
casing shoe according to the invention in two
embodiments, andFig. 4shows casing tubes with tube couplings according
to the invention.The
