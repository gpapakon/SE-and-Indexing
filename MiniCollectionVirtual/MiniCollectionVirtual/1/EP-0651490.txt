<ABSTRACT>
An overvoltage protection circuit employs a series of semiconductor switching 
elements, each element having a control terminal and two main conduction terminals, 

in a totem pole configuration and two potential dividers whose tapping points feed, 
respectively, the control terminals and the main terminal junctions of the switching 

elements. Both the series of switching elements and the two potential dividers are 
connected between a reference node (zero volts) and a node to be protected from an 

electrostatic discharge. The resistive elements of the potential dividers are so 
arranged that, in the absence of a static discharge, all switching elements are cut off 

and experience a substantially equal voltage across the respective main terminals. In 
this way, the circuit may be usefully employed in integrated circuits which are based 

on a low-voltage integration process but which have also a high-voltage-supply rail 
(e.g. 30V). The switching elements may be bipolar transistors, and preferably 

Darlington pairs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an overvoltage protection circuit, and in particular,
although not exclusively, an electrostatic discharge protection circuit for an integrated
circuit device for use with high-voltage power supplies.Integrated circuits are often damaged by voltage transients which can overload
active elements within the device and cause permanent damage. Diodes are used in most
devices for internal transient protection, as shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, diodes 11 and
12 are connected to an input node 13 of an integrated active circuit 14 (e.g. an amplifier)
such that in normal operation they are reverse-biased, but when the node 13 is subjected
to a transient outside the normal supply voltage range, one or other of diodes 11 and 12
becomes forward-biased and protects the internal circuitry of the active circuit.A problem arises, however, when high-voltage supplies are to be used with
integrated circuits formed by processes yielding inherently low-voltage devices. Under
these circumstances, the diodes can be subjected to voltage drops which cause breakdown
of the semiconductor junctions forming the diodes. An example of this is the use of a 30v
supply on an integrated circuit comprising devices having a breakdown voltage of only
15v.It would be desirable to provide an overvoltage protection circuit which can be
used in place of a conventional diode clamp to overcome the above-mentioned drawback.In British Patent No. GB 1393748 there is disclosed a voltage clipper circuit for
protecting electronic equipment from transient voltages, for use in place of two oppositely
connected diodes, the circuit comprising a plurality of controllable switching elements
connected in series across a D.C. input to the equipment, with biasing means responsive 
to an excess input voltage to permit a limited current flow through the controllable
switching elements for the duration of the excess input voltage.According to the present invention, there is provided an overvoltage protection
circuit for connection between a first node and a second node, which second node is to
be protected against over-voltage with respect to the first node, the protection circuit
including a plurality of controllable switching elements each having a control terminal
and first and second main terminals, the switching elements being connected in series
between the first and second nodes by way of junctions between respective first and
second terminals of adjacent switching elements, and biasing means connected to said
plurality of switching
