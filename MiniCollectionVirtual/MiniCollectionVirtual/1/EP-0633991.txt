<ABSTRACT>
A flexible joint (10) for the connecting and sealing of tubular sections (12, 14) that includes a flexible pad (20) having inner (24) and outer (22) surfaces. A contoured portion (30) extends around the inner surface (24) of the pad (20). The flexible joint (10) further includes a first tubular section (12) having a raised portion (46). The raised portion (46) engages the contoured portion (30) on the inner surface (24) of the pad (20). A second tubular section (14) includes a housing (58). The housing (58) has exterior (60) and interior (62) surfaces. The interior surface (60) of the housing (58) engages the outer surface (22) of the pad (20) for retaining the pad (20) in a sealing relationship with the first tubular section (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to a
flexible joint for the sealing of tubular sections.
More specifically, the invention is directed to a
flexible joint having a flexible pad positioned
between aligned tubular sections to provide a
flexible, sealed connection.Flexible joints are used for the joining of
tubing in, for example automobile fluid conveying
systems. The flexible joints must be capable of
bending, twisting and moving axially in response to
forces on the tubing. The flexible joints must also
preferably provide sound and vibration dampening. The
present invention meets the above requirements and
also provides a relatively inexpensive and easy to
manufacture flexible joint.US-A-2 477 533 describes a pipe joint
particularly designed for mating pipes of large
diameter such as cast concrete pipes. The joint
includes a gasket ring of rubber or rubber-like
material which is fitted on the male pipe, the male
pipe being provided with at least two annular
projections. The male pipe is then wedged tightly
into the female pipe.US-A-3 576 335 describes a flexible tube
connection using a resilient seal member. However,
the resilient seal member does not have an annular 
groove with which an outwardly extending raised
portion of one of the tube ends can engage and
consequently the said tube end can be pulled through
the resilient seal member and come into contact with
the other tube end.US-A-2 229 587 describes a flexible coupling for
tubes comprising a pair of relatively movable coupling
members, an elastic packing member surrounding and
serving to support the tube and disposed between said
coupling members, and a clamping sleeve to tightly
compress the packing member against the tube with the
tube ends in abutment with one another.The present invention is directed to a flexible
joint for the connecting and sealing of tubular
sections. The flexible joint includes a flexible pad
having inner and outer surfaces. A contoured portion
extends around the inner surface of the pad. The
flexible joint further includes a first tubular
section having an annular raised portion. The raised
portion engages the contoured portion on the inner
surface of the pad. A second tubular section includes
an annular housing. The housing has exterior and
interior surfaces. The interior surface of the
housing engages the outer surface of the pad for
retaining the pad in a sealing relationship with the
first tubular section.Specifically, according to the present invention
there is provided a flexible joint for the sealing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A flexible joint for the sealing of tubular
sections comprising in combination:


a flexible pad (20), said pad having inner
and outer surfaces (24, 22) that extend along an axis

in a generally cylindrical configuration, said
flexible pad (20) having an annular groove extending

around said inner surface (24) ;
a first tubular section (12) formed of a
wall (40) extending along an axis to an open end (42),

said wall having a cylindrical outer surface (44),
said outer surface having a single outwardly extending

raised portion (46), said outwardly extending raised
portion of said first tubular section being adapted to

engage the annular groove of said flexible pad; and
a second tubular section (14) aligned with
said first tubular section and formed of a wall (50)

extending along an axis to an open end (52), said wall
having a cylindrical outer surface (54) ;
said wall of said second tubular section
having an integral housing (58) said housing having

exterior and interior surfaces (60, 62) said interior
surface of said housing engaging said outer surface of

said pad for retaining said pad in a sealing
relationship with said first tubular section, and
said first and said second tubular sections
not being in contact with one another.
A flexible joint as claimed in claim 1
further comprising a second housing (66) extending

over and engaging said exterior surface of said
housing, a gap (69) being maintained between said

second housing and said outer surface of said first
tubular section whereby said gap allows said flexible 

joint and said first and second tubular sections to
move in response to force.
A flexible joint as claimed in claim 2
further comprising a containment element (71)

positioned around said first tubular section between
said flexible pad and said second housing whereby said

containment element retards said flexible pad from
entering said gap.
A flexible joint as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims, wherein said flexible pad is

comprised of an elastomeric material.
A flexible joint as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims wherein said flexible pad

includes at least one tapered edge on said outer
surface of said pad, said tapered edge defining a

relief area.
A flexible joint as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims wherein said flexible pad is

bonded to at least one of said first and second
tubular sections.
A flexible joint as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims wherein layers of synthetic resin

polymers are positioned on said interior surface of
said housing and on said raised portion of said first

tubular section.
