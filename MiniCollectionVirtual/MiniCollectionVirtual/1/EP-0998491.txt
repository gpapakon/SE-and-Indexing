<ABSTRACT>
The hop mosaic virus (HMV) gene has been isolated and purified, and the base sequence thereof elucidated. HMV can be detected by simple and accurate methods using nucleic sequences from the isolated HMV gene. These methods are especially useful for detecting HMV infection in plants. Using the methods provided by the present invention, it is possible to detect HMV more simply and accurately as compared to the conventional immunological methods, such as ELISA.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the gene of the hop mosaic virus (abbreviated as
HMV hereafter) and diagnostic methods for detecting HMV.HMV, a pathogenic virus of hop, is a filamentous shaped virus comprising a single
stranded RNA genome and belongs to the same cartavirus group as the hop latent virus.
HMV is an important causative pathogen of mosaic symptom to susceptible hop cultivars
[Probasco and Skotland, Can. J. Microbiol. 22: 116011162 (1976); Adams and Barbara,
Ann. Appl. Biol. 96: 201208 (1980); Adams and Barbara, Ann. Appl. Biol. 101: 495500
(1982); Yu and Liu, Plant Pathology 36: 3844 (1987); Kanno et al., Ann. Phytopath. Soc.
Japan 680 (1994)]. Therefore, for the production of hop, surveys of fields which are not
contaminated with this virus and inspections of virus-free seedlings are performed.Conventionally, for the confirmation of virus-free seedlings and the field survey to
prevent the viral reinfection immunodiagnostic methods such as ELISA have been
employed. However, HMV diagnosis by ELISA poses various problems such as
difficulties in the preparation as well as availability of antibodies. Furthermore, even
though antibodies are available, ELISA still poses problems such as inferior accuracy of 
diagnostic results due to nonspecific reactions of the antibodies.On the other hand, since gene sequences of various viruses have been elucidated
owing to the recent progress in molecular biology, certain species of viruses can be
accurately detected and diagnosed using genetic engineering techniques. However, the
detection of HMV has relied upon the above-mentioned immunological procedure, because
its gene sequences have not been elucidated.Therefore, the present inventors have actively pursued efforts to isolate and purify the
HMV gene and elucidate its base sequence. Furthermore, they have developed methods
for detecting HMV using such nucleic acid sequences.As described above, the present invention provides the gene of hop mosaic virus or
nucleic acids comprising the partial sequence thereof, i.e., fragments of the HMV gene.These isolated and purified (e.g., synthesized) nucleic acids allow the detection of the
virus present within hop seedlings and in fields with by genetic procedures. For example,
genetic procedures such as PCR, hybridization method, etc., using these nucleic acids
enables the detection of minute quantity of the virus in a highly accurate manner.The above described nucleic acids can be prepared from either the genomic RNA of
hop mosaic virus or its corresponding
