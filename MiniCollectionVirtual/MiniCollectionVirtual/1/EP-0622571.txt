<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hydraulic 
control circuit for a hydraulically operated 
transmission of a vehicle and, in particular, to a 
hydraulic control circuit for a transmission which 
operates automatically in normal operation, but which 
can be operated manually. It is common practice in automatic 
transmissions for motor vehicles to provide a number 
of friction operated devices (such as clutches or band 
brakes) which are operated to interconnect gears 
within the transmission. The friction devices are 
operated in a predetermined pattern dependent on the 
required drive ratio from the transmission. In these 
known arrangements, hydraulic fluid is used to control 
the operation of the friction devices. Flow of fluid 
to the friction devices is controlled by a number of 
shift valves. Each shift valve controls a ratio shift 
(first to second, third to second, etc.) in the 
transmission. Because of the number of shift valves 
required, the layout of the required fluid lines 
within the hydraulic control circuit becomes 
complicated. An example of such a hydraulic control 
circuit in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 is 
disclosed in US-A-4984484. DE-C-1120900 discloses a 
hydraulic control circuit having a shift valve and a 
manual valve. It is an object of the present invention to 
overcome the above mentioned disadvantage. To this end, a hydraulic control circuit in 
accordance with the present invention is characterised 
over US-A-4984484 by the features specified in the 
characterising portion of claim 1.  
 Preferably, the fluid path selection means 
comprises a ball valve having two fluid inlets and one 
fluid outlet, the fluid outlet being fluidly 
connectable to said one friction device, and a ball 
movable between the two fluid inlets and capable of 
closing one or the other of the fluid inlets. The hydraulic control circuit preferably 
further comprises a pressure control valve associated 
with each friction device, each pressure control valve 
comprising a spool reciprocally movable in a bore to  
 
modulate the fluid pressure applied to its associated 
friction device. Preferably, the hydraulic control circuit 
further comprises at least two pressure application 
valves fluidly connected with the ports in the shift 
valve and with each other, each pressure application 
valve comprising a spool reciprocally movable in a 
bore to allow or prevent pressurised fluid passing 
therethrough. The control means preferably comprises at 
least two separate fluid lines between the manual 
val
