<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phosphinate esters, their preparation and their use in synthesis. Phosphinate esters having a reactive P-H group and a protected P-H group have been used 
in the synthesis of pharmaceutically active substances such as the substituted 
propane-phosphonous compounds described in EP 0181833. In synthesis, the protected 
P-H group generally has be to converted into a P-H group after reaction of the protected 
phosphinate ester with another compound. With the known protected phosphinate esters 
previously used in such synthesis, the protecting group has had to be removed by 
hydrolysis under acid conditions. This imposes a limitation on the use of such protected 
phosphinate esters, since they cannot be used where hydrolysis under acid conditions 
would have an undesirable effect on other groups present. It has now been found that certain phosphinates having a reactive P-H bond and a 
protected P-H bond, many of which are novel, can be reacted with compounds having at 
least one group reactive with a P-H bond to give products from which the protecting group 
can be removed by hydrolysis under mild basic conditions. Accordingly, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a compound of formula 
where R¹ and R² are independently a C₁-C₁₀ aliphatic radical, or R¹ is a C₁-C₁₀ aliphatic 
radical and R² is a C₆-C₁₀ aromatic radical, and R³ is a C₁-C₈ aliphatic radical, a C₃-C₈ 
cycloaliphatic radical, a C₆-C₁₅ aromatic radical or a C₇-C₁₃ araliphatic radical, provided 
that R³ is not methyl when R¹ and R² are each methyl, that R³ is not ethyl when R¹ and R² 
are each methyl and that R² is not p-aminophenyl when R¹ is methyl and R³ is ethyl.  Generally, in compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined, R¹ and R² are 
independently C₁-C₁₀ alkyl, which may be unsubstituted or substituted, for example by 
halogen, preferably fluorine or chlorine, or R¹ is such a group and R² is a C₆-C₁₀ aryl 
group, which may be unsubstituted or substituted, for example by halogen. R¹ or R² as unsubstituted or substituted C₁-C₁₀ alkyl may be, for example, methyl, ethyl, 
n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, 
n-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-nonyl or n-decyl, or any of these groups substituted by halogen, 
for example 2-fluoroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, trichloromethyl, 2-chloroethyl, 
2,2,2-trichloroethyl, or 2-chloro-n-propyl. R² as C₆-C₁₀ aryl may be, for example, phenyl, 
o-tolyl, m-tolyl, p-tolyl, 2,3-dimethylphenyl, 2,4-dimethylphenyl,
