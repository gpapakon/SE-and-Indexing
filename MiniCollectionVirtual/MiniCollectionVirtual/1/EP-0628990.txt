<ABSTRACT>
Lowering of the airtightness of the reaction chamber of the appartus due to thermal degradation of the vacuum seal of the 
connection between the reaction chamber and a manifold is prevented, and particles produced from members of the apparatus 

due to the heating of the apparatus is prevented from contaminating the inside of the chamber. The wall of the reaction chamber 
is extended to the location sufficiently apart from the lower end of the heater around the reaction chamber. An exhaust port is 

provided in the wall to exhaust the reaction chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat treatment 
apparatus which evacuates during flowing a predetermined reaction 
gas and processes objects with heat in maintaining a predetermined 
pressure. Fig.1 is a partial cross sectional view of a vertical 
type heat treatment apparatus in the art. A heat treatment 
apparatus has a wall 2 of a reaction chamber 1 made of a high 
purity material such as quartz and the like. The wall is formed as 
a cylindrical shape which is closed one end thereof, and the other 
end is opened and is connected to a manifold 4. The connection is 
sealed in vacuum by an O-ring and the like. Most of the wall 2 of 
the reaction chamber 1 is surrounded by a heater for heating the 
reaction chamber 1. A compartment tube 3 is mounted on the manifold 4, and 
the compartment tube 3 has a length as reached on about the top of 
the reaction chamber 1. Also, in the manifold 4, an inlet 9 for 
introducing a reaction gas is provided below the compartment tube  
 
3 and an outlet 10 for exhausting is provided above the position of 
connection of the compartment tube 3. Inside the compartment tube, an object supporting boat 5 placing a 
plurality of objects 7 such as semiconductor wafers with a space between 
them in vertical and a boat table 6 for supporting the boat 5 are provided 
capable of loading into and unloading from the compartment tube. A 
treatment processed to the objects 7 is to form a thin film by a chemical 
vapor growth, and is annealing or the like. Below 
the manifold 4 a flange 8 for shielding an opening of the manifold 
and an elevator mechanism for moving the flange 8 in vertical are 
provided in an elevator chamber ( not shown in the figure ). The 
flange 8 can be elevated in vertical by a motion of the elevator 
mechanism, and the boat table 6 mounted on the flange 8 and the 
boat 5 are loaded into and unloaded from the wall 2 of the 
reaction chamber 1 thereby. When the flange 8 contacts to a 
shoulder formed under the manifold 4, the reaction chamber is 
sealed and is separated completely from the exterior environment. The treatment is performed by introducing the reaction 
gas from the inlet 9 after containing the objects in the reaction 
chamber 1 and sealing it. The reaction gas goes upwardly through 
the inside of the compartment tube 3, and the gas goes downwardly 
through a space between an outer wall of the compartment tube 3 
and an inner surface of the wall 2 of the reaction chamber 1 from 
an opening of the upper part of the compartment tube 3 after a 
predete
