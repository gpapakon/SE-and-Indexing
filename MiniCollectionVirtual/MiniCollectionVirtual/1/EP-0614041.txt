<ABSTRACT>
Fastening device (12) for flush-mounted lighting 
bodies (11) suitable for being positioned on a side support 

surface of a lighting body, constituted by one pair of 
arms (13',13'') arranged in compass fashion, and constrained, by 

means of a screwed rod (14), at a first, enlarged end 
thereof (15). Furthermore, said arms (13',13'') are kept mutually 

spaced apart, in a rest position, by a spring (18). Said 
screwed rod (14) is slid into a through-bore (19') provided in 

the inner arm (13'), and a screwed bore (19'') provided in the 
outer arm (13'') of said pair of arms and, in that way, 

provides, in conjunction with the screwed bore (19''), an arm 
clamping element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fastening device 
for flush-mounted lighting bodies. The flush-mounted lighting bodies can be 
manufactured with a degree of protection against the 
possible penetration of liquid substances, e.g., 
water, or solid substances. The presence of hooking 
devices may result in a decrease in the desired 
protection degree the structure of the flush-mounted 
lighting bodies is designed with. A commonly used fastening type is based on the 
use of sliding brackets, and two variants thereof 
exist. According to the first variant, a slot is 
provided through the support bands, and according to 
the second variant, on the contrary, said slot is 
provided through the same bracket. In the first one of said variants, the necessary 
slot for the system to perform its task, results in a 
very serious drawback, because the lighting body no 
longer has its tightness characteristics. The same drawbacks affects also the second 
variant described above. In fact, according to said 
variant, the sliding bracket must be accessed for 
being manipulated, from the interior of the flush-mounted 
lighting body. Of course, as briefly mentioned 
above, it is the presence of this opening, the element 
which turns the lighting article or body into a non-protected 
one against particles of solid or liquid 
materials entering it. Another fastening device for lighting bodies is  
 
of the type with double-arm springs (e.g as disclosed in US-A-4 872 097), which allows the 
above mentioned drawback to be overcome; however, also 
it results in several problems. One of them is shown when one tries to install 
lighting bodies, above all when these are made from a 
thermoplastic material. In fact, the thrust applied by 
the springs is so strong, that the geometry of the 
body is altered, which may even make it impossible 
several accessories to be applied. Another drawback displayed by this type of 
anchoring is caused by the friction between the 
springs and the support surface on which the lighting 
body is to be fastened. Such surfaces usually are 
several types of false ceilings which, when are made 
from soft materials, e.g., wallboard, are damaged by 
the stress applied by this type of devices. Another drawback is caused by the overall 
dimensions of the accessory equipment, which is linked 
in offset position relatively to the central body. 
When it has to be introduced into the false ceiling, 
the whole lighting body complete with such accessory 
equipment, must be inclined; the consequence is that
