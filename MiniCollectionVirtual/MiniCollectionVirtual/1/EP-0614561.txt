<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrographic
sensors, and particularly contact sensors.Contact sensors, and particularly touchscreens,
are becoming a popular input device for computers.
Touchscreens allow people who have never used a computer
before to easily interact with the computer. They are
finding use in cars, airports, factories, shopping malls,
hospitals, training centers, banks, grocery stores,
libraries, and pharmacies. Common applications are
automatic bank tellers, point of sale systems, and
information systems found in airports for providing
directions to various locations or information regarding
local hotels.One common type of touchscreen is an
electrographic touchscreen or sensor of the type
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,220,815.
Such a screen
typically comprises a first sheet of flexible material
capable of being energized to establish an electrical
potential. The sensor also has a second sheet capable of
being energized to establish an electrical potential in
juxtaposition with the first sheet. By pressing on the
first sheet with a stylus or finger, selected portions of
the two sheets come together, thereby generating an
electrical signal corresponding to the locus of the
portion of the flexible sheet pressed. In order to keep
the two sheets separated when they are not pressed, a
plurality of discrete insulating buttons or islands are 
provided. The islands are sized and located so pressure
on the first sheet results in the two sheets contacting.A problem of contact sensors is that the two
sheets can occasionally remain in contact when the
pressure is removed, i.e., the two sheets stick together.
This sticking renders the device on which the sensor is
being used inoperative. Such sticking can result from
environmental conditions, such as high temperature and/or
humidity, manufacturing defects, and the cohesive forces
of the material selected.Sticking is a serious and costly problem.
Often the entire sensor needs to be replaced when
sticking occurs. Moreover, the entire machine using the
sensor is down and inoperative until the problem has been
solved. Further, much user ill can occur when a computer
system does not operate because of a defective
touchscreen.Much scientific effort has been directed to
this problem. Among the solutions considered have been
changing the size and/or material of the insulating
islands, roughening the surface of the various sheets,
changing the materials of the sheets, and providing
special coatings on the sheets. None of these solutions
has been totally
