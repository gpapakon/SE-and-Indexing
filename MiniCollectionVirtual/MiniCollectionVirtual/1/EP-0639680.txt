<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of hangers bear profile rails (1) of a suspended ceiling. A vertical hanger part (3) extending through a layer of insulating panels (5) exhibits, at its lower end, a widened retaining part into which the profile rail (1) engages. The retaining part projects through a central opening (11) of a horizontal supporting plate (12), which is fixed on the retaining part by turning it. The supporting plate (12) supports the insulating panels (5) before the supporting rails (1) are fitted.

A hanger for suspended ceilings including a sectional 
support structure (1) and a layer of insulating panels (5) supported by 

the same; including a vertical hanger section (6) extending through the 
layer of insulating panels (5), including a flared retaining section (7) 

at its bottom end, including a minimum of one engaging recess (9) for 
connection of the section (1), characterised in that the retaining 

section (7) projects through a central aperture (11) in a horizontal 
support panel (12), that the support panel (12) by two opposite edge 

sections (14) of its central aperture (11) engages into opposite edge 
recesses (10) of the retaining section (7) after rotation around the 

longitudinal axis of the hanger section (3) and that the edge sections 
(14) of the support panel (12) engaging in the edge recesses (10) of 

the retaining section (7) each including an ascending slanted area (15). 
A hanger according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
each slanted area (15) ends at an angular distance from a rotary stop 

(16), limiting any rotation of the support panel (12) in relation to the 
retaining section (7). 
A hanger according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
rotary stops are formed by edge projections (16) of the support panel 

(12) projecting into the central aperture (11), brought into contact 
with the section of the retaining section (7) projecting into the 

central aperture. 
A hanger according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the support panel (12) consists of metal sheet, reinforced 

within the area of the largest radial  
 

extension (13) of a central aperture (11) by beads (17) 

having approximately parallel edges. 
A hanger according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the hanger section (3) consists of metal sheet, 

reinforced by beads (18) having approximately parallel 
edges. 
A hanger according to Claim 4 and 5, characterised 
in that the beads (17) of the support panel (12) and/or 

the beads (18) of the hanger section (3) are designed as 
double beads, each consisting of two individual moulded 

beads extending in opposite directions from the metal 
sheet level, with one bead blending directly into the 

other bead via a transitional section ascending to the 
other side. 
A hanger according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the retaining section (7) consists of an essentially flat 

metal sheet section, including one engaging recess (9) 
each for supporting a flange (1a) of a C-section (1) on 

its two opposite edges (8) and that the two edge recesses 
(10) accommodating the support panel (12) are provided 

above the said engaging recesses (9). 
A hanger according to Claims 1 or 7, characterised 
in that the retaining section (7) includes a section (22) 

flared in its top section extending from its bottom edge 
(21), for supporting a bead (23) of a T-section (24) and 

that two edge recesses (10) supporting the support panel 
(12) are provided above the notch (22). 
A hanger according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the slanted areas (15) ascend in both directions of 

rotation.
