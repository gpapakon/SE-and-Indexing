A system for transmitting and receiving data is provided. The system includes a direct-conversion receiver that receives a signal modulated on a carrier frequency signal. The direct-conversion receiver includes one or more subharmonic local oscillator mixers. A local oscillator is connected to the direct conversion receiver, and generates a signal having a frequency equal to a subharmonic of the carrier frequency signal. A transmitter is connected to the local oscillator, which uses the local oscillator signal to transmit outgoing data.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE U.S. RECEIVING OFFICESPECIFICATION accompanyingTITLE: SYSTEM AND APPARATUS FOR A DIRECT CONVERSION RECEIVER AND TRANSMITTERFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention pertains to the field of data transmission. More specifically, the invention relates to a system and apparatus for data transmission that allows a direct conversion receiver and transmitter to be used without the shielding or offset circuitry for a direct current component in the received signal that is normally required for such direct conversion receivers and transmitters .RELATED CASES This case is related to U.S. Patent Application serial number 09/260,919, "DIRECT CONVERSION RECEIVER," filed March 02, 1999, which is commonly owned and assigned with the present application and is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. 

 BACKGROUND Direct conversion receivers are known in the art. In a direct conversion receiver, the received carrier frequency signal with the data signal modulated on it is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator having the same frequency as the carrier frequency. The signal product of these two signals is a signal having components at the base band and at two times the carrier frequency. The high frequency component can be filtered using a low pass filter, such that the data signal remains in the base band signal. The base band signal is then processed to extract the data encoded in the transmitted signal.One drawback of direct conversion receivers is that the local oscillator can radiate a leakage signal that may be stronger than the signal transmitted and received by the antenna. In this configuration, it is possible for the local oscillator signal to be received at the antenna of the direct conversion receiver or at intermediate points between the antenna and the mixer. If this condition occurs, the radiated local oscillator signal is received and mixed with the local oscillator signal that is provided directly at the input of the mixer, which creates a significant DC signal component in the output from the mixer.In order to prevent the generation of a DC signal from such feedback, shielding or filtering can be performed. Likewise, it is also possible to offset the DC signal by applying a DC signal that is equal to that created by the leakage signal from the local oscillator and having a reverse polarity. Both shielding and offsetting the DC signal require additional costs, such as the cost and expense of shielding, the additional weight of shielding,
