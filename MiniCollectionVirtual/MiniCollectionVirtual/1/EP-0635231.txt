<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to supply ground coffee portions (36, 37), which are connected by means of a transporting belt (34), in a defined and fully-automatic manner to a coffee brewing apparatus, there is proposed a mechanical interface (1) which fixes a transporting belt portion (34) in a defined position. The interface (1) is formed by two functional units, one of which is fastened to a container (45) with the ground coffee portions (36, 37) accommodated therein. The other functional unit is designed as receiving frame (17) and can be coupled to the first functional unit. The mechanical interface (1) is additionally provided with positioning elements (27, 28) for defined fixture to a coffee brewing apparatus. Furthermore, a container (45) for receiving a plurality of coffee portions (36, 37) with a mechanical interface (1) is proposed, as well as a transporting belt (34) intended for cooperation with a mechanical interface (1).
