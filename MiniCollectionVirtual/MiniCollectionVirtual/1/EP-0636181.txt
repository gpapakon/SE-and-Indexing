<ABSTRACT>
This invention pertains to methods for using oxalate oxidase in plant pathology. A substantially pure gene encoding the oxalate oxidase enzyme is elucidated. The expression product of the gene which can be stably incorporated into a foreign plant host has a unique profile including a pH optimum of 3.5, a positive heat stability, a single sub-unit of approximately 25 kilodaltons and protease stability. The methodology of this invention exploiting oxalate oxidase for protection against oxalic acid encompasses providing to a plant in need of oxalic acid protection an oxalic acid degrading enzyme in an amount sufficient to protect the plant from the oxalic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the genetic improvement of plants by the use of
recombinant DNA techniques. Particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates
to the improvement of the tolerance of plants to disease.From the beginning of agriculture humans have been confronted with the
problem of plant disease. Throughout history many strides have been made against
plant diseases as exemplified through the use of hybrid plants, pesticides and
improved agricultural practices. However, as any farmer, home gardener, or house
plant devotee can attest, the problems of plant disease are an ongoing and constant
problem in plant cultivation. This invention constitutes a major step forward in
solving the problem of plant disease by exploiting a long known fact regarding the
method by which certain microbes, especially fungi, attack plants. Specifically, this
invention addresses a means by which the etiologic (disease causing) agent is slowed
or prevented from actually entering into the plant tissue, thereby preventing disease.
Alternatively, in instances where complete invasion is not prevented the present
invention confers upon plants a means for reducing the effects of infection thereby
reducing or preventing plant mortality due to the disease.In order for a plant pathogen to infect a plant, it must be able to gain access
into and subsequently throughout the plant. Plant pathogens accomplish this in
various ways. Generally, this is accomplished by the secretion of chemical substances
that affect certain component and/or metabolic mechanisms of the plant to be
attacked, i.e., the host for the pathogen. The main groups of compounds that are
secreted by plant pathogens and that are related to the disease-causing mechanism are
toxins, enzymes, polysaccharides and/or other effectors of growth. One such
chemical compound is oxalic acid or oxalate which can be degraded by the enzyme
oxalate oxidase. Although the reaction catalysed by oxalate oxidase is well-known,
the physico-chemical attributes of the enzyme as exemplified by barley oxalate
oxidase are incorrectly reported in the literature.The secretion of oxalic acid as a means by which plant pathogens attack plant
hosts is commonly found in a plurality of fungal genera and especially in the genera
Sclerotinia, Sclerotium, Aspergillus, Streptomyces, Penicillium, Pythium, Paxillus,
Mycena, Leucostoma, Rhizoctonia and Schizophyllum. These genera of fungi,
especially those fungi of the genus Sclerotinia, are known to cause destructive and
fatal diseases of numerous
