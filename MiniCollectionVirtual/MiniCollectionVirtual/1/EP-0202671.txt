<ABSTRACT>
In order to utilize memo data written by hand at the time 
of retrieving the document, the original document image 

data is stored and, thereafter, a document image data with 
memo is separately input, the document image data with 

memo being comprised of the original document image onto 
which is additionally written memo data by hand. The 

position of the document image data with memo is then 
brought into alignment with the original document image 

data and is collated to extract only those memo data written 

by hand. Then the kind of memo is discriminated, the 
process is effected depending upon the kind of memo, and 

the memo data is stored in the secondary data file for 
retrieval. To retrieve the document, the memo data of a 

plurality of documents are read out from the secondary data 
file depending upon the kind of memo that is designated, 

and are displayed as a look-up table. If the operator 
designates any one of them, the image of the corresponding 

original document is read out from the original document 
image file and is displayed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
storing and retrieving image data. More specifically, 
the invention relates to a method of storing secondary 
data such as memos added to document image as index 
data of a document image and to a method of retrieving the 
document image by utilizing the secondary data. Accompanying the recent trend toward putting 
into practice the optical disc device which is capable 
of storing large amounts of data, attention has 
been given to a document image filing system as 
a new document control means to electronically file 
the document data and to retrieve the data by using 
a display device. If the content of a document 
is treated as an image, the document which includes 
figures and photographs in addition to characters 
can be electronically filed. Therefore, a wide 
range of documents such as general literatures, 
books and slips, design drawings, written contracts, 
and the like can be stored in a memory device. According to a conventional retrieval system,  
 
index data such as names of the documents, classification 
codes, keywords and the like are registered 
in correspondance with the document 
images. To retrieve the data, a user designates 
these index data so that the contents of the corresponding 
document are produced on the display device. 
A system of this type has been disclosed, for example, 
in a journal "NIKKEI COMPUTER" published by Nikkei 
McGrawhill Co., December 26, 1985, pp. 62-64. 
Since items common to each of the documents have 
been selected, the above-mentioned retrieval data 
are not helpful to directly retrieve a document 
that is being sought if the user does not remember 
the name of the literature or the keyword or if 
he remembers them vaguely. In this case, the document 
images are displayed successively to retrieve the 
correct one by his eyes. As a method to facilitate the retrieval of 
the document image, the applicant of the present 
invention has proposed a method of retrieving an image 
in JP-A-59-183 458 
according to which secondary reference data 
such as memos specific to the image data are registered, 
and the image data is specified with reference to  
 
the thus registered data at the time of retrieval. Further, a device for filing an image in which the user 
has to indicate regions in the image which contain information 
used for file management is described in EP-A-0 117 336. 
The image information used for file management is encoded and 
stored in a file management memory. The encoding process converts 
the

<CLAIMS>
A method for storing image data of an original document 
(12) in a file memory (5) of a filing system by 


extracting secondary data (92...95) from a specified local 
region (20, 83) of an image (17) including said original document 

(12), said secondary data allowing visual identification 
and retrieval of the original document (12), and 
storing said secondary data (92...95) into a second memory 
(5', 90) together with a code (91) indicating the corresponding 

original document in the file memory (5), 
characterized
in that said image (17) is a processed image including said 
original document (12) and additional memo data (M1, M2, M3) 

which are added to the original document by the user to specify 
said secondary data; and by the following steps of the image 

processing system: 
comparing the processed image (17) with the stored original 
document (12) to detect the portion in which the processing 

image and the stored document differ from each other by said 
memo data (M1, M2, M3) (step 150), 
classifying said detected portion depending upon the type 
(46, 92, 93, 94) of said memo data (M1, M2, M3) composed therein 

and by comparison with predetermined classification standards, 
and providing it with a corresponding classification code (step 

154), and 
specifying said local region (20, 83) of said processed 
image (17) with its size and position depending on the type (46, 

92, 93, 94) of memo data (M1, M2, M3) detected, for extracting 
said secondary data (92...95). 
The method of claim 1, wherein said secondary data contains 
position coordinates (92, 93, 94, x
o
, y
o
...x
3
, y
3
) of the local 
region. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said secondary data is image 
data contained in said local region of said original document 

(12). 
The method of claim 1, further comprising a step of 
discriminating characters contained in said local region to 

convert them into character codes (95) to be stored as secondary 
data in the second memory (5', 90). 
The method of claim 1, wherein the secondary data is stored 
in said second memory (5', 90) for each of said classifications. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said memo data includes a 
mark (M1, M2) that is applied onto the document (12) to 

designate said local region (20, 83). 
The method of claim 6, wherein said mark consists of a 
marking line (M1) for designating a local region that includes a 

plurality of characters in the document. 
The method of claim 6, wherein said mark consists of a 
frame (M2) that surrounds a plurality of characters in the 

document. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said memo data contains a 
word (M3) that consists of a plurality of characters. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps of: 

preparing a document (13) in a form in which at least one 
indication (FR) is added to indicate a reference position in the  

 
image read from said file memory (5), and 
determining and correcting the skew of the processed image 
(16) that contains the indication (FR) at said reference 

position, 
wherein the image (17) is compared with the original 
document (12) after the correcting step. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the method comprises further 
the fol.lowing steps for retrieving a desired document (12) 

stored in said file memory (5): 

designating at least one section of the secondary data 
(92...95) (step 170) by means of the classification code, 
reading out from the second memory (5', 90) and displaying 
the secondary data (51, 52, 53) that corresponds to the designated 

section (step 172), and 
specifying the document (12) that is to be read out from 
the file memory (5) and corresponds to the secondary data (51, 

52, 53) that is displayed. 
The method of claim 11, further comprising the following 
steps: 


designating a type (46, 92, 93, 94) of said additionally 
written memo data (M1, M2, M3), 
reading out secondary data (92...95) representing a local 
region in the original document (12) in accordance with said 

designated type (46, 92, 93, 94) from said second memory (5', 
90) and displaying it in the form of a look-up table (51, 52, 

53) (step 172), 
selecting one of said secondary data displayed in said 
look-up table (51, 52, 53) (step 174), and 
retrieving from the file memory (5) the document image data 
corresponding to said selected secondary data. 
The method of claim 12, wherein the step of displaying the 
look-up table (51, 52, 53) comprises displaying plural secondary 

data simultaneously.
