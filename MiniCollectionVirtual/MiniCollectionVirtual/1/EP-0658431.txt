<ABSTRACT>
In an ink-jet printing unit comprising a printing 
head (24) mounted on the reservoir, a measuring circuit 

comprising a pair of electrodes (40,41) which 
substantially enclose the volume of ink within the 

reservoir, allows hysteresis-free linear mode measurement 
of variations in the ink volume within the reservoir and 

the signalling of at least one of the ends of the 
variation interval to indicate the most suitable moment 

for recharging ink in the reservoir by means of a 
cartridge (20) inserted into the reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a measuring
apparatus for the ink-level in ink-jet printing unit and
more particularly to a measuring apparatus for the
ink-level in an ink-jet thermal printing unit comprising
an ink-jet thermal printing head integral with the
reservoir which is repeatedly rechargeable, whenever the
ink has dropped to a pre-determined volume. The
recharging may be carried out by means of a syringe, or by
means of a small capacity cartridge compared with that of
the reservoir, as described in European patent application
N° 943006684.5 in the name of the applicant.End of ink detection apparatus are known in the state
of the art for printing units and more generally for units
with an ink-jet printing head.In particular US patent N° 4 183 029 describes a
detection apparatus showing the end of ink flow in the
duct between the reservoir and the printing-head, due to
an obstruction therein, caused by an air bubble or an
impurity.US patent N° 5 051 759 describes an ink-end detector,
in which two electrodes are fitted in the sponge located
in the reservoir and impregnated with ink. The electrodes
are connected to a detector circuit that measures the
electrical resistance of the ink placed between the
electrodes. As known, as the ink is consumed, the sponge
progressively empties from one end to the other where the
electrodes are fitted. However the ink resistance does
not vary extensively until the level of the ink reaches
the zone of the electrodes, then rapidly increases
thereafter. US patent N° 5 136 305 describes a similar end of ink
detector, whereby a thermistor is inserted into the
sponge, in contact with the ink and receiving a d.c.
supply. Measurement of the temperature increase of the
thermistor represents the reduction in volume of ink in
the sponge.US patent N° 5 162 817 describes an end of ink
detector for an ink-jet printing head fed by a replaceable
cartridge. The head comprises its own reservoir complete
with an ink-impregnated sponge, onto which the cartridge
can be coupled. The detector comprises three electrodes
fitted in the sponge and selected in pairs for detection
with the head in the horizontal or the vertical position.European patent application N° 440 110 describes
another end of ink detector for an ink-jet printer wherein
the reservoir containing an ink-impregnated sponge can be
replaced and connected to the head by means of a hollow
needle penetrating the reservoir. The reservoir has two
electrodes, one fitted in the sponge, and the other
inserted in the feed duct to

Apparatus for measuring ink level in an ink-jet
printing unit, comprising:


a print-head (24);
a container (12) integral with said print-head
including a pair of opposite walls, said container
