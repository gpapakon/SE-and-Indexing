<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connection device comprises a strip of springy material (1), bent over into the desired configuration, and a malleable material (3) deposited in the thickness of the springy material (1). The manufacture, mounting by insertion, reflow and connection provide electrical contacts (17, 19) which do not extend laterally beyond the corresponding clips (clamps) (12). Application, in particular, to the automatic insertion of contacts on hybrid circuits.

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connection device of the type 
comprising a bent configuration made of resilient 

material capable of elastic holding and a coating of 
malleable soldering or brazing material to be melted in 

order to ensure an electrical connection, characterised 
in that the coating of malleable material (3) is placed 

substantially within the thickness of the resilient 
material (1), being lodged in a groove (2) made within 

the thickness of the resilient material (1). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the groove (2) has a flat base (2a) and two 

splayed edges (2b, 2c). 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that at least one of the edges (2b, 

2c) of the groove (2) is external to the elastic 
contact line (16), such that the malleable material (3) 

is separated from said contact line (16) by a given 
distance (d). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the malleable material (3) is 

bent and cut out with the resilient material (1) so as 
not to protrude laterally over the elastic holding 

elements (12). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the device is in th
e form of a 
strip, having a ladder-like configuration with holes 

(8, 9) for guiding and positioning for automatic 
insertion of electrical contacts on one side of a 

hybrid circuit, printed circuit or the like.  
 
A device according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that after automatic insertion the malleable material 

(3) is melted, flows by capillary attraction and 
solidifies, forming electrical contacts (17, 19) which 

do not protrude substantially past the elastic holding 
elements (12). 
A method for producing an electrical connection 
device, comprising the following steps: 


a) a groove (2) is made in a strip (1) of resilient 
material; 
b) said groove (2) is filled completely with 
malleable soldering or brazing material; 
c) the strip (1) comprising the groove (2) filled in 
a ladder-like configuration, provided with three 

positioning holes (8, 9), is cut. 
A method according to Claim 7, furthermore 
comprising the following stages: 


d) simultaneous bending and punching of the coated, 
cut strip is effected, in order to form elastic holding 

elements (12); 
e) the coated, cut, bent and punched strip is wound 
on a storage reel. 
A component or hybrid circuit comprising mounting 
by insertion, melting and solidification of an 

electrical connection device according to one of Claims 
1 to 6.  

 
An electronic device comprising mounting by 
insertion, melting and solidification of an electrical 

connection device according to one of Claims 1 to 6.
