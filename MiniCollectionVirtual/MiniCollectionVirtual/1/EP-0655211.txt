<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mattress having a core formed 
from foamed material. The core comprises a core part (3) and a 

number of edge parts (4), the core part (3) in longitudinal section of 
the mattress having a gradually increasing thickness from the 

two ends in the direction of the center. The core part (3) is 
manufactured from a material having a greater stiffness than 

the edge parts (4) and the core formed by the core part (3) with edge 
parts (4) provided thereon is substantially block-shaped, the 

arrangement being such that the stiffness of the mattress 
gradually increases in the direction of the center.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a mattress according to the
preamble of claim 1.Normally, mattresses have a core formed from foamed
material, such as, for instance, foam rubber or latex
rubber, are substantially block-shaped, and have a constant
stiffness distributed over the surface. During use, the
mattress under the body of the user will be compressed
locally, causing a deformation of the mattress. When the
user is in a normal lying position, his hips will be located
approximately at the center of the mattress, his head near
the head end and his feet near the foot end. Hence, in that
position, the larger part of his weight will be borne by the
center portion of the mattress, and consequently, the
greatest compression will occur at that location. At the
head and foot ends, this compression will clearly be
smaller.The deformations of the mattress that occur have an
adverse effect on the durability of the mattress and on the
outward appearance thereof, in particular during use, but
due to repeated use, permanent deformations will occur as
well. Moreover, the deformations occurring have an adverse
effect on the body support and hence on the practical
comfort of the mattress. Due to the greater compression of
the mattress, a hollow is formed in the center portion of
the mattress, as a consequence of which the user's head and
feet are pushed upward relative to his hips and his back is
forced into a bent, unfavourable position.The mattress described in the preamble, which is known
from FR-A-2 002 306 overcomes the disadvantages of the
conventional mattresses. The known mattress comprises a
first part and a second part. The first part can be
considered to be a core part but forms the top of the
mattress. The second part forms the bottom of the mattress. 
The thickness of the core part increases in the longitudinal
direction from the longitudinal ends towards the
longitudinal center of the mattress.The object of the invention is to provide a mattress
having the advantages of the mattress known from FR-A-2 002
306 which can be used on both sides.According to the invention, the mattress described in
the preamble is characterized by the features mentioned in
the characterizing portion of claim 1.Such a mattress is turnable, as a result of which the
mattress is simple in use and the service life can be
influenced positively, because the two sides of the mattress
will periodically be loaded mechanically and thermally,
while the body-supporting characteristics on both sides of
the mattress are equal.The mattress according

<CLAIMS>
A mattress having a core (101, 201) formed from foamed
material, the core comprising a first part (103, 203) being

a core part (103, 203) and at least one second part (104,
204), the core part (103, 203) having a thickness which,

seen in longitudinal section of the mattress, gradually
increases from the two longitudinal ends (108, 208) in the

direction of the center, the core part being manufactured
from a material having a greater stiffness than the at least

one second part (104, 204), the core (101, 201) formed by
the core part (103, 203) and the at least one second part

(104, 204) being substantially block-shaped, the arrangement
being such that the stiffness of the mattress gradually

increases in the direction of the center, characterized in
that, the at least one second part comprises at least two

edge parts (104, 204), the core part (103, 203) being
substantially diamond-shaped and being located centrally

between the edge parts (104, 204) relative to the top and
bottom faces of the core (101, 201), such that the mattress

can be used on two sides.
A mattress according to claim 1, characterized in that
the core part (103, 203) defines at least a part of the top

and/or bottom face of the core (101, 201).
A mattress according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that edge parts (104, 204) located

near one end of the core (101, 201) on both sides thereof,
abut against one another by a contact face (112, 212).
A mattress according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the core part (103, 203) is

glued together with the edge parts (104, 204).
A mattress according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the stiffness of the mattress

increases linearly from the two ends (108, 208) in the
direction of the center.
A mattress according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the proportion of the 

stiffness of the core (101, 201) near the foot end (108,
208) to the stiffness near the center and near the head end

(108',208') is as at least 3:4:3, and preferably as 1:5:3.
A mattress according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the mattress ins inversely

symmetrical.
A mattress according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the core (101, 201) is
