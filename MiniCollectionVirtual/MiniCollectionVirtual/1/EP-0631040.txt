<ABSTRACT>
A four-stroke engine comprising an engine frame 
including a block (111) and a head (113), the block forming at 

least one cylinder (114) and a crankcase (112). A piston (116) is 
mounted for reciprocation in the cylinder (114), and a 

crank (117) and connecting rod (118) are mounted in the crankcase 
(112) and connected to the piston (116). The crankcase (112) includes 

a fuel inlet port (128) and an outlet port, and a 
duct connects the outlet port (131) to an intake passage (132) 

in the head. The inlet port (128) is connected to a supply 
of a combustible mixture comprising fuel, lubricating 

oil and air. During engine operation, the 
mixture flows through the crankcase (112), the duct (132), and 

the air intake passage (128) to the cylinder (114). Valves (119,120) and 
valve actuating mechanisms control the flow of the 

mixture to the cylinder (114) and the flow of exhaust from 
the cylinder. The oil in the mixture lubricates the 

engine parts in the crankcase (112), the valves (119,120) and the 
valve actuating mechanisms. The duct (132) preferably 

forms a plenum or surge tank containing the mixture 
under pressure. The engine may include more than 

one cylinder and piston, such as a two-cylinder 
engine having pistons which move in synchronism to 

produce crankcase compression.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal combustion
(IC) engine, and more particularly to an IC
engine particularly suited for use in hand-held
(portable) tools.Relatively small size IC engines are well known
and are commonly used to power tools such as chain
saws, blowers, line trimmers, etc. Since such tools
are normally carried and used by a single person,
the engine must be light weight and capable of operation
in different orientations (sideways or
straight up, for example).At the present time, most engines for this
purpose are two-stroke air-cooled engines because
they have a good power vs. weight and size ratios,
do not have a complex construction, and they are all
position or orientation engines. The latter feature
is made possible because such engines utilize a
diaphragm-type carburetor and engine lubrication is
accomplished by adding lubrication oil to the fuel
(typically a 40:1 fuel-to-oil mixture).While two-stroke engines of this type work
well, they have certain drawbacks. The fuel consumption
rate is relatively high and the operating 
noise level is also high. A very important disadvantage
is that the emissions levels of such engines
are quite high because the exhaust includes a sizable
amount of fresh fuel. The State of California
regulations soon to become effective limit the
amounts of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide that may
be produced, and most or all two-stroke engines
presently in use will not be able to meet the
California standards. It is expected that those
standards will also be adopted by other states and
countries.Four-stroke IC engines are, of course, also
well known and they generally have lower hydrocarbon
and carbon monoxide emissions than two-stroke engines.
This is true because four-stroke engines
exchange the exhaust and fresh fuel/air mixture in a
more positive manner with the use of valves. Four-stroke
engines also in general have lower noise levels.Relatively small four-stroke engines are available
and have been used in, for example, model or
hobby aircraft. While such engines are sufficiently
small to be used in portable tools, they would not
be satisfactory because they have a relatively complex
and light duty construction. Four-stroke engines
normally have an oil sump in a crankcase at
the bottom of the engine and an oil pump for moving
the oil to the moving parts such as the overhead
valves and the valve actuating mechanisms. This
type of lubricating system is not satisfactory for
all-position use. FR-A-2 519 695 describes a four-stroke internal-combustion engine

A four-stroke internal-combustion engine for operation with a
combustible mixture of air, fuel and lubricating oil, comprising an

engine frame comprising a block portion (611) and a head portion
