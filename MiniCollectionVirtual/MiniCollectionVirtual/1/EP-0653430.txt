<ABSTRACT>
A process for forming 1-phenylvinyl-1-phosphonic acid utilizes 
reacting a mixture of phosphorus trihalide, such as phosphorus 

trichloride, and acetophenone with water, under conditions in which 
the water is gradually added to the mixture with cooling to form a 

reaction mixture, which can be sparged of excess acetophenone with 
aqueous acid while under vacuum, comprising the 

1-phenylvinyl-1-phosphonic acid. This product can be recovered from 
the reaction mixture by recrystallization from aqueous mineral acid, 

such as hydrochloric acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is an improved process for the synthesis of 
1-phenylvinyl-1-phosphonic acid (PVPA), which can be polymerized to 
higher molecular weight species or processed with further 
polymerizable compounds in the manufacture of copolymers. Some 
representative references which describe how this well-known compound 
can be formed include the following: Conant et al. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 
44, 2530-2536 (1922), which shows the use of acetophenone, phosphorus 
trichloride, and glacial acetic acid as reagents; and U.S. Patent No. 
4,529,559, which shows the reaction of acetophenone, phosphorus 
trichloride, and water in Example 5 under heating conditions of up to 
150°C. The temperature conditions used in the previously mentioned 
patent were used to remove residual acetophenone from the reaction 
mixture but they can lead to a lessened product yield due to the 
formation of dimeric and oligomeric by-products. The present invention is a process for forming 
1-phenylvinyl-1-phosphonic acid (PVPA) and comprises reacting a 
mixture of phosphorus trihalide, such as phosphorus trichloride, and 
acetophenone with water, under conditions in which the water is 
gradually added to the mixture with cooling to form a reaction 
mixture, which is sparged of excess acetophenone while under vacuum, 
comprising the 1-phenylvinyl-1-phosphonic acid. This product can be 
recovered from the reaction mixture which results from the sparging 
operation by recrystallization from a dehydrating acid, such as 
hydrochloric acid.  The present invention is advantageously practiced by first combining 
phosphorus trichloride and a molar excess of acetophenone which serves 
both as a solvent and reagent for the instant process. Approximately a 
one to two molar excess of the acetophenone is adequate. After these 
reagents have been allowed to become thoroughly mixed, preferably at 
ambient or room temperature, water is then gradually added, preferably 
dropwise, with sufficient cooling to preferably maintain the 
temperature in the range of from about 5°C to about 60°C. The 
resulting reaction mixture will contain the desired PVPA product along 
with undesired excess, non-reacted acetophenone which must be removed. The removal of the excess acetophenone is accomplished in accordance 
with the present invention by sparging the reaction mixture, while 
under vacuum, with an acid, such as aqueous HCl, which catalyzes the 
dehydration of the intermediate product initially formed, hydrolyzes 
any cyclic and/or oligomeric
