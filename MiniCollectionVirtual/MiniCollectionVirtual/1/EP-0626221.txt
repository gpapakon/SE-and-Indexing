<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for bending a band-shaped work (W), the apparatus 
including a stationary cylinder (1) having at least a pair of slits (3) 

on diametrically opposite sides thereof, the slits (3) providing a 
passageway (3A) in which the work (W) is inserted through the slits 

(3), a rotary sleeve (2) accepting the stationary cylinder (1) with a 
gap interposed therebetween, the rotary sleeve (2) having a first 

opening (6) and a second opening (7) on diametrically opposite sides 
thereof, a first driving means (8) for feeding the work (W) passed 

through the passageway (3A) in the stationary cylinder (1) and the 
first (6) and second (7) openings of the rotary sleeve (2), and a 

second driving means (14, 15, 16) for rotating the rotary sleeve (2) by 
a predetermined amount while the movement of the work (W) is stopped so 

as to bend the work (W) between the stationary cylinder (1) and the 
rotary sleeve (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for bending a 
band-shaped work such as a blade used for punching thin sheets of 
paper, cloth, leather, wood, and plastics to a desired shape. In this 
specification, the band-shaped work will be called "bandwork" for 
explanation convenience. The term "work" as used herein thus includes 
a strip-form or band-form tool or article, such as may be used, for 
example, in punching or perforating a piece of sheet material. When a band-shaped blade is used to punch a sheet to a desired 
shape, it is mounted on a base, and fitted in a groove formed therein 
to the desired shape. In order to enable the band-shaped blade to fit 
in the groove, the blade should be previously bent at an obtuse angle, 
an acute angle or right angle depending upon the shapes of the groove 
and the radius of curvatures as shown in Figure 8 where the full line 
indicates a contour to be punched along and the dotted lines indicate 
foldable lines.  
 There are at least four known methods of bending a bandwork; 
first, by hand with a special tool; second, by means of three rollers 
(Figure 9A); third, by means of a pair of molds each having a required 
radius of curvature where the work held between the molds is punched 
under a single blow (Figure 9B); and fourth, by gradually bending the 
bandwork while it is fed through a pair of chips inch by inch (Figure 
9C). See for example EP-A-0 317 637. The last-mentioned method encounters two difficulties; one is 
that when a bandwork is bent at one spot at an obtuse angle, it often 
happens that the subsequent bending is difficult by bringing the 
already bent portion of the bandwork with the apparatus, and the other 
is that accumulated dimensional errors eventually fail to achieve the 
intended accuracy. According to the present invention, there is provided an 
apparatus for bending a work such as a bandwork, the apparatus 
including a stationary cylinder having at least a pair of slits on 
diametrically opposite sides thereof, the slits providing a passageway 
in which the work is inserted through the slits, a rotary sleeve 
in which the stationary cylinder is received 
with a gap interposed therebetween, 
the rotary sleeve having a first opening and a second opening on 
diametrically opposite sides thereof, a first driving means for feeding 
the work passed through the passageway in the stationary cylinder and 
the first and second openings of the rotary sleeve, and a second 
driving means for rotating the rotary sleeve by a predetermined
