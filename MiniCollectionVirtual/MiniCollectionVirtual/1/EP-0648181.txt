<ABSTRACT>
In a large wheeled bin (1) of the type commonly used for refuse collection a vertical divider (4) is inserted dividing the bin into two compartments (5 and 6) for the collection of different types of recyclable material. The planar divider (4) has lugs (8) protruding through holes in the side walls (9) of the bin, the lugs being secured by caps (10) engaged over the lugs. A description of the barbed engagement of the caps (10) with the lugs (8) is given together with an embodiment in which there are no caps (8) but the divider is held in place by deformation of the side walls (9) due to a convex profile on the lower edge of the divider (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
 BIN DIVIDER TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to a bin divider and has been devised particularly though not solely as a vertical divider to divide a wheeled garbage bin into two compartments so that at least one of those compartments can be used for the collection of recyclable waste material .BACKGROUND ART In the past it has been common in many domestic and commercial situations to arrange for the collection of garbage and other waste in wheeled garbage bins which are typically injection moulded from a resilient plastics material and which typically have a hinged lid and a capacity between 120 and 240 litres, although larger bins are also known.There are many systems available for the semi- automated collection of such bins by engaging the bin with a lifter arm on a collection truck and elevating and inverting the bin to empty the contents into a hopper in the truck.Proposals have been made to use such bins for the collection of recyclable waste, eg: waste paper, bottles, cans and plastic containers but in order to make such collections efficient it is highly desirable for the user to pre-sort some of the recyclable material. For example it is desirable to provide a container having at least two compartments so that waste paper can be placed in one compartment and recyclable bottles, cans and plastic containers in the other compartment. Proposals have also been made for the semi-automated emptying of such containers in a manner that the material held in the different compartments is emptied into different defined areas of a collection vehicle. The most economical way of providing a suitable compartmentalised container or bin is to incorporate a vertical partition into existing wheeled bins which may, for example, presently be used for the collection of 

garbage .In one aspect the present invention therefore provides a method of inserting a vertical partition into a refuse or recycling bin of resilient plastics material, comprising the steps of: providing a partition of generally planar configuration having an outline corresponding approximately to the internal cross-sectional profile of the bin at the desired location for the partition, said partition having lugs protruding from the outline in predetermined locations, forming holes in the walls of the bin in locations corresponding to the locations of the lugs when the partition is positioned in its desired location, deforming the walls of the bin to bulge outwardly in the region of the holes, inserting the partition into the bin with the lugs

CLAIMS : -
1. A method of inserting a vertical partition into a refuse or recycling bin of resilient plastics material, comprising the steps of : providing a partition of generally planar configuration having an outline corresponding approximately to the internal cross-sectional profile of the bin at the desired location for the partition, said partition having lugs protruding from the outline in predetermined locations, forming holes in the walls of the bin in locations corresponding to the locations of the lugs when the partition is positioned in its desired location, deforming the walls of the bin to bulge outwardly in the region of the holes, inserting the partition into the bin with the lugs aligned with the holes, and allowing the bin walls to revert to their original shape with the lugs engaged in the holes . 2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the bin has an outwardly extending upper rim and the lugs include a pair of upper lugs located such that they engage under the rim, the upper lugs being formed as a continuation of the planar partition, each having a relatively wide upper edge tapering downwardly to a relatively narrow lower edge.
3. A method as claimed in either claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the partition has a convex lower edge adapted to bear against the bottom of the bin, causing the side walls of the bin to be biased inwardly in the vicinity of the partition.
4. A method as claimed in claim 3 including the step of forcing the partition downwardly into the bin, causing the convex lower edge of the partition to deform the middle area of the bottom of the bin downwardly and flex the bin in such a manner that the side walls are biased inwardly in 
'
the vicinity of the partition, positively engaging the lugs in the holes. 


5. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the lugs are deeper than the bin wall thickness and wherein a plurality of caps are provided and engaged with protruding portions of the lugs, one to each, after the lugs are engaged in the holes, preventing withdrawal of the lugs from the holes once engaged with the caps.
6. A divider for dividing the interior of a refuse-type bin having walls and a base into two compartments, the divider comprising a sheet material member shaped to fit within the bin in a desired location, and a plurality of lugs extending from the side edges of the divider adapted to engage slots formed in the walls of the bin in corresponding locations .
7. A bin divider as claimed in claim 6 wherein the lugs are adapted to protrude through the slots beyond the outer face of the walls, and a plurality of caps are provided engageable over the lugs, one to each, preventing withdrawal of the lugs from the slots once engaged with the caps . 8. A bin divider as claimed in claim 7 wherein the faces of each lug are grooved providing engagement ledges for corresponding members within the cap.
9. A bin divider as claimed in claim 8 wherein the cap is formed from a resilient material and has inwardly extending barbed protrusions engageable with the ledges of the lug.
10. A bin divider as claimed in claim 9 wherein the cap has side walls from which the barbed extrusions extend, the side walls extending through the corresponding slot in the bin wall to lie between the slot edges and the lug when engaged with the lug.
11. A bin divider as claimed in any one of claims 7 to 10 wherein the cap has outwardly extending members arranged to engage the outer face of the adjacent bin wall upon attempted withdrawal of the lug from its slot, preventing that withdrawal.
12. A bin divider as claimed in claim 11 wherein the outwardly extending members form a skirt extending 


outwardly around the cap.
13. A bin divider as claimed in claim 6 wherein the divider has a convex lower edge adapted to bear against the bottom of the bin, causing the side walls of the bin to be biased inwardly in the vicinity of the divider.
