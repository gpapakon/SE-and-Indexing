<ABSTRACT>
A novel lactone-modified polyvinyl acetal resin and a novel carboxyl-modified 
resin thereof are disclosed. 
The novel resins of the present invention can be used as a polyol 
resin for coatings curable at ordinary temperatures or heating, adhesives, 

binders, a processing agent for fibers, a curable resin composition by 
mixing with a curing agent which can react to hydroxyl groups, and a 

composition for a magnetic recording medium, etc. 
The novel resins of the present invention have graft chains 
containing primary hydroxyl groups bonded to the ester group derived from 

a lactone compound, or the primary hydroxyl groups and carboxylic groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel lactone-modified polyvinyl
acetal resin in which the ring of a lactone compound is opened by hydroxyl
groups in a polyvinyl acetal resin and a process for the preparation thereof.The novel lactone-modified polyvinyl acetal resin of the present
invention can be used as a polyol resin for coatings curable at ordinary
temperatures or in heating, adhesives, binders, a processing agent for
fibers, and a curable resin composition by mixing with a curing agent which
can react with hydroxyl groups.The novel lactone-modified polyvinyl acetal resin of the present
invention has graft chains containing primary hydroxyl groups bonded to the
ester group derived from a lactone compound.Furthermore, the present invention relates to a novel curable resin
composition which comprises the lactone-modified polyvinyl acetal resin and
a compound having functional groups capable of reacting with hydroxyl
groups.Still further, the present invention relates to a composition for a
magnetic recording medium which comprises (a) a lactone-modified polyvinyl
acetal resin as set forth in claim 1, (b) a urethane prepolymer, (c) a 
polyisocyanate compound, (d) a powdered magnetic substance, and, optionally,
(e) at least one selected from the group consisting of a polyester
resin, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, a vinyl chloride resin having
a plasticizer, and a vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer having a
plasticizer.Moreover, the present invention relates to a novel lactone-modified
polyvinyl acetal resin having carboxylic groups at terminals of graft
chains, a process for the preparation thereof, and a curable resin
composition.A polyvinyl acetal resin is one of the thermoplastic resins which
has been commercially used as a polyol resin for various coatings,
adhesives, binders for powdered magnetic substances used for a magnetic
recording media, a treatment agent for fibers, and an interlayer for
multilayers glass used as windshields in cars, and which has the characteristics
of an excellent resistance to light, transparency, dispersity in
pigments, toughness, and adhesion.However, its ductility, solubility, curability, compatibility, and
thermoplasticity must be further improved. Furthermore, in the case when
a polyvinyl acetal resin alone is used, it does not have sufficient
thermoplasticity. Accordingly, it is generally used with a plasticizer.Although polyvinyl acetal resin mixed with a plasticizer can provide
a soft film, there are problems in that the plasticizer would move
dispers
