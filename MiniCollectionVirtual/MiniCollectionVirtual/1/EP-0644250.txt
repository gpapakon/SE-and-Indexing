<ABSTRACT>
A process for breaking the emulsion which commonly forms in the caustic system of 
olefin plants comprising mixing the emulsion with an effective amount of a Group II metal salt 

of an alkyl aryl sulfonic acid, wherein the alkyl contains 4-24 carbon atoms, most preferably 8-14 
carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for breaking up emulsions which typically form in the 
caustic systems of cracking operations designed to produce olefins. More particularly, the 
invention concerns a method for breaking up caustic emulsions of oxygenated compounds which 
form in the caustic systems of olefin plants. In cracking operations, such as in the pyrolytic cracking of ethane, propane, and naphtha 
to form olefins, oxygenated compounds including carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes and 
ketones are formed. The amount of carbonyl compounds formed in such operations can vary 
widely, but is typically about 1-100 ppm in the product gas stream. Concentrations as high as 
1000 ppm are occasionally encountered depending upon the use of various feedstocks and 
cracking temperatures. The product gas stream is typically passed through a basic wash (pH > 7) 
to remove acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. Oxygen containing 
compounds, particularly acetaldehyde, tend to undergo polymerization in the presence of the 
basic wash or scrubbing conditions. In the caustic scrubbing system of such plants, the polymers of acetaldehyde and other 
oxygenated compounds are able to mix with the caustic, which may form an emulsion. In some 
plants this emulsion can become severe enough to be a bottleneck to plant operations. In other 
plants, the polymers are removed quite easily from the caustic scrubbing system along with the 
spent caustic. The spent caustic and polymers are then pumped to an accumulator or surge 
drum. In the surge drum, hydrocarbon and aqueous layers are separated. The hydrocarbons are 
lighter than water and float to the top of the drum, where they are skimmed off and disposed 
of. Caustic which has separated from the hydrocarbon is then treated in various ways and 
returned to the caustic scrubbing system. Unfortunately, the acetaldehyde polymer and other  
 
organic polymers occasionally form stable emulsions in the surge drum, and these emulsions 
seriously interfere with the separation of caustic and hydrocarbons in the surge drum. The 
hydrocarbons then contain too much caustic to be disposed of, and less caustic is available to 
be restored to the system. At the present time there exists a continuing need for an effective 
demulsifier to break the troublesome emulsions into two distinct layers. The present invention in a broad aspect comprises a method for resolving the emulsions 
which form in the caustic systems of olefin cracking operations. The invention more
