<ABSTRACT>
The magnet contains a magnetic yoke and two pole shoes (10) between which a highly homogeneous magnetic field is set up. The pole shoes (10) are provided with special pole plate devices (12). Each pole plate device (12) is separated with respect to a base part (10b) facing the yoke by a narrow correction air gap (14). According to the invention, each pole plate device (12) contains two mutually parallel pole plate elements (12a, 12b) which are separated by a gap (22) of predetermined width (w). In this case, the plate element (12a) facing the base part (10b) has a relative permeability ( mu r1) which is at least a factor of 5 smaller than that of the plate element (12b) facing the working volume (N), the relative permeability ( mu r2) of the latter plate element being at least 10,000.
