<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing Ti
<
3+
>
-containing solutions, in which titanium-containing raw materials are digested with sulphuric acid with the addition of metallic iron, and their use in the preparation of titanium dioxide.

Process for the production of a solution containing
Ti
3+
, characterised in that an undigested residue from
the digestion of raw materials containing titanium

with sulphuric acid using the sulphate process or
mixtures thereof with other raw materials containing

titanium is digested with sulphuric acids using the
sulphate process at an initial sulphuric acid

concentration of 
>
 80 wt.% H
2
SO
4
 and a temperature of

>
 150Â°C and the resultant digestion cake is dissolved
with water and/or sulphuric acid, wherein metallic

iron is added before or during digestion in such a
quantity that, once the digestion cake has been

dissolved, the digestion solution contains at least
5 wt.% to 100 wt.% of Ti
3+
, relative to the total
titanium content in the digestion solution.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the metallic iron used is iron scrap, steel scrap,

cast iron scrap and/or another scrap material
containing metallic iron having a content of 
>
 1 wt.%
iron, relative to total weight.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the molar quantity of the added metallic iron amounts

to 0.25 to 5 times the molar quantities of titanium
and iron introduced into the digestion by the raw

materials, with the exception of the quantity of added
metallic iron.
Use of the solution containing Ti
3+
 produced according
to claims 1 to 3 in the production of titanium dioxide

using the sulphate process for reducing Fe
3+
 in the
digestion solution. 
Process for the production of titanium dioxide using
the sulphate process by digestion of raw materials

containing titanium with sulphuric acid to form a
digestion cake, dissolution of the digestion cake with

water and/or sulphuric acid to form a so-called
digestion solution (black solution), separation of

insoluble constituents (residue) from the digestion
solution, reduction of Fe
3+
 in the digestion solution,
hydrolysis to form titanium oxide hydrate, separation

of the titanium oxide hydrate from the hydrolysis
mother liquor (thin acid), calcination of the titanium

oxide hydrate to form titanium dioxide, characterised
in that reduction is performed with a solution

containing Ti
3+
 produced according to claims 1 to 3.
