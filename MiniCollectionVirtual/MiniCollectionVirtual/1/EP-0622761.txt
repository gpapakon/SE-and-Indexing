<ABSTRACT>
For the separation of articles, especially persons or vehicles, for example for access checks, the identification of the articles is recorded in a first phase. This can be carried out, for example, by means of a reader which reads the information of a check mark or a ticket which is carried by the article. On the other hand, in addition, the weight and/or size of the article is also recorded and fed to a recording station. As a result of the evaluation of the recording station, if appropriate a blocking member, for example a revolving grating or a barrier, is actuated. An additional measurement of the weight and/or size of the article is preferably carried out as a check in front of the blocking member.

<CLAIMS>
Method for separating articles in a channel-like passage,
particularly persons or vehicles to which identification data

are assigned, comprising in a first phase on the one hand the
detection and checking of said identification data and on the

other hand the detection of the weight and/or size of the article
and feeding such measured data to an analysing unit (4),

said passage being provided at its end with a locking means (7)
operated in response to the analyses in the analysing unit (4)

of the information of the measuring or detection stations (2),
characterised in that in a second phase the weight and/or the

size of the article is detected once again in said passage after
said identification station but before said locking means

(7), and in feeding such data also to the analysing unit (4),
whereby the locking means (7) is brought in a closed position

if the measured values of the weight and/or size of the article
during said second phase are not approximately identical with

the corresponding measured values in said first phase.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that additional
sensors (1, 3, 6) are provided in that passage for detecting

and transmitting to the analysing unit the direction of
movement of the article.
Method according to any of claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the locking means (7) is in its basic state open and is 

brought in the closed position only if no valid article has
been detected in a simultaneous measuring of the weight and/or

size during the first or the second phase.
Application of the method of any of claims 1 to 3 in the
access control of rooms, installations, transport means or

similar.
Application of the method of any of claims 1 to 3 for determining
evaluation criteria depending from the weight or size

of articles, particularly of persons or vehicles, preferably in
transport installations.
