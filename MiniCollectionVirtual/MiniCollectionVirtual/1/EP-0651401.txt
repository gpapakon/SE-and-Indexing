<ABSTRACT>
A permanent magnet which contains R, T and B as main 
ingredients wherein R is Y or a rare earth element and T is Fe 

or Fe and Co and has a primary phase of R₂T₁₄B is produced by 
compacting a mixture of 60 to 95 wt% of a primary phase-forming 

master alloy and a grain boundary phase-forming master alloy 
both in powder form and sintering the compact. The primary 

phase-forming master alloy has columnar crystal grains of 
R₂T₁₄B with a mean grain size of 3-50 µm and grain boundaries 

of an R rich phase and contains 26-32 wt% of R. The grain 
boundary phase-forming master alloy is a crystalline alloy 

consisting essentially of 32-60 wt% of R and the balance of Co 
or Co and Fe. In anther form, a permanent magnet which 

contains R, T and B as main ingredients wherein R is yttrium or 
a rare earth element, T is Fe or Fe + Co/Ni and has a primary 

phase of R₂T₁₄B is produced by compacting a mixture of a 
primary phase-forming master alloy and a grain boundary-forming 

master alloy both in powder form and sintering the compact. 
The primary phase-forming master alloy has a primary phase of 

R₂T₁₄B and grain boundaries of an R rich phase. The grain 

boundary-forming master alloy contains 40-65 wt% of R, 30-60 
wt% of Fe, Co or Ni and 1-12 wt% of Sn, In or Ga.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing rare
earth permanent magnets.Rare earth magnets of high performance, typically powder
metallurgical Sm-Co base magnets having an energy product of 32
MGOe have been produced on a large commercial scale. However,
these magnets suffer from a problem that the raw materials, Sm
and Co, cost much. Of rare earth elements, some elements of
low atomic weight, e.g., Ce, Pr, and Nd are available in more
plenty and less expensive than Sm. Iron is less expensive than
cobalt. For these reasons, R-T-B base magnets (wherein R
stands for a rare earth element and T stands for Fe or Fe plus
Co) such as Nd-Fe-B and Nd-Fe-Co-B magnets were recently
developed. One example is a sintered magnet as set forth in
Japanese Patent Application Kokai (JP-A) No. 59-46008.
Sintered magnets may be produced by applying a conventional
powder metallurgical process for Sm-Co systems (melting →
master alloy ingot casting → ingot crushing → fine 
pulverization → compacting → sintering → magnet), and
excellent magnetic properties are readily available.Generally, a master alloy ingot produced by casting has a
structure wherein crystal grains made up of a ferromagnetic
R2Fe14B phase (referred to as a primary phase, hereinafter) are
covered with a non-magnetic R-rich phase (referred to as a
grain boundary phase, hereinafter). The master alloy ingot is
then pulverized or otherwise reduced to a particle diameter
smaller than the crystal grain diameter, offering a magnet
powder. The grain boundary phase has a function to promote
sintering by converting into a liquid phase and plays an
important role for the sintered magnet to generate coercivity.One typical method for the preparation of R-T-B sintered
magnets is known as a two alloy route. The two alloy route is
by mixing two alloy powders of different compositions and
sintering the mixture, thereby improving magnetic properties
and corrosion resistance. A variety of proposals have been
made on the two alloy route. All these proposals use an alloy
powder having approximately the same composition (R2T14B) as the
primary phase of the final magnet and add a subordinate alloy
powder thereto. The known subordinate alloys used heretofore
include R rich alloys having a higher R content and a lower
melting point than the primary phase (JP-A 4-338607 and USP
5,281,250 or JP-A 5-105915), R2T14B alloys containing a
different type of R from the primary phase (JP-A 61-81603), and
alloys containing an intermetallic compound of R (JP-A 5-21219).One of the alloys
