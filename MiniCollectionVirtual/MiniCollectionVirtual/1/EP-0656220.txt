<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an in-line skate.Skates are known constituted by a shell and at least
one quarter articulated thereto. A usually C-shaped frame is
also associated below the shell.Two or more aligned wheels are pivoted between the
wings of said frame.For this conventional skate there is currently the
problem of achieving optimum wheel braking in order to be
able to stop and also to adjust the speed.For this purpose it is known to associate a block or
pad, usually made of rubber, with the wheel supporting frame
in a region that is adjacent either to the heel or to the
toe. When the user tilts the shoe and thus the frame
forward or backward, the free end of the block or pad
interacts with the ground and braking is thus achieved.However, these solutions are not optimum, since they
require the user to impart a given rotation, at the toe or
heel regions, to the shoe and thus to the frame associated
therewith, and this can cause a loss of balance with
consequent falls.US Patent 1,402,010 discloses a roller skate provided
with a band that can be secured at the user's leg above the
malleolar region; a rod is connected to said band.Said rod surrounds the leg to the rear and is then
curved so as to laterally affect the leg until it is
associated, at its ends, in the malleolar region, with a
lever system which is articulated to a structure that
protrudes from the wheel supporting frame.The lever system protrudes to the rear of the frame and 
is connected to a plate which is shaped approximately
complementarily to the curvature of part of an underlying
and facing wheel.This solution is not free from drawbacks: first of all,
a relative movement between the band and the leg is produced
throughout sports practice, and this does not make its use
comfortable due to the continuous rubbing of the band on the
leg.Furthermore, the plate is activated every time the
user bends his leg backward beyond a given angle, with no
true and easy possibilities to vary this condition.Still, each user has a different leg shape, and braking
is thus achieved at different rotation angles for an equal
rod length.Furthermore, the rod acts and presses in the malleolar
region, and this can cause discomfort or accidental impacts.US Patent 333,751 discloses a skate having, below the
support for the shoe, a supporting frame for two mutually
parallel wheels to which the elbows of two essentially L-shaped
arms are articulated towards the rear region of the
shoe.An auxiliary wheel and two brakes which face the
rolling surface of the
