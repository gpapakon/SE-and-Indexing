<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to in-situ cleaning of 
unwanted films and particles of a material from a 

surface situated inside a vacuum chamber (12) by 
equipping such chamber with a means (30,32) of 

generating a magnetic field having a magnetic flux 
density of at least 25 gauss, flowing at least one gas 

into the chamber through an inlet port (20) and 
igniting a plasma by an RF generator (18) to produce 

plasma ions of at least one gas, switching on the 
magnetic field generating means (30,32) to a magnetic 

flux density of no less than 25 gauss and, reducing 
the magnetic field by a flux density of at least 10 

gauss such that the unwanted films and particles of 
the material are dislodged from the surface by the 

sudden change in the magnetic flux density at the 
magnetic field.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a novel method of 
cleaning unwanted films and particles from a surface situated inside a 
vacuum chamber and more particularly, relates to a novel method of 
in-situ cleaning unwanted films and particles of a contaminant material 
from a surface situated inside a vacuum chamber which is equipped with 
plasma enhancement and a magnetic field generating means such that 
unwanted films and particles can be dislodged from the surface by a 
magnetic field spiking technique. In the fabrication of semiconductor devices, various 
structures such as metallization layers, passivation layers, insulation 
layers, etc. are formed on a substrate. The quality of the 
semiconductor device fabricated is a strong function of the processes 
with which these structures are formed. The quality is also a function 
of the cleanliness of the manufacturing environment in which the 
substrate is processed.  Technological advances in recent years in the increasing 
miniaturization of semiconductor circuits necessitate more stringent 
control of impurities and contaminants in the processing chamber of the 
semiconductor device. When the miniaturization of the device progresses 
to the submicron level, the minutest amount of contaminants can 
significantly reduce the yield of wafers. For instance, the presence of 
particles during deposition or etching of thin films can cause voids, 
dislocations or short-circuits which adversely affect performance and 
reliability of the devices. Particle and film contamination has been significantly 
reduced by improving the quality of clean rooms and by automated 
equipment designed to handle semiconductor substrates, and also by 
improving techniques used to clean the substrate surfaces. However, 
many particles are generated and film contaminated inside substrate 
processing chambers themselves. Possible sources of contamination 
include processing materials, interior walls of processing chambers, and 
the mechanical wear of the automated substrate handling equipment. In processing equipment that uses plasma enhancement, many 
chemically reacted fragments of various kinds are generated from the 
processing gases which include ions, electrons and radicals. The 
fragments can combine to form slightly negatively charged particles 
which may ultimately contaminate a substrate being processed. 
Additionally, various materials such as polymers are coated onto the 
process chamber walls during plasma processing. Mechanical and thermal  
 
stresses may cause
