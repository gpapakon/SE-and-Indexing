<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of measuring the thickness of paste-like or dough-like material on a moving surface (5). A movably mounted measurement roller is laid on the layer and, while the surface covered by the layer moves past, the distance the roller is displaced at right angles to the direction of motion of the surface is determined by means of a sensor which generates an output signal. One parameter of this output signal is functionally related to the magnitude of the measurement-roller displacement, i.e. the thickness of the layer. In order to maintain precision and avoid the layer being measured being wound on the measurement roller, a pre-defined braking force is exerted on the roller.

A method of measuring the thickness of a layer of paste-like or dough-like ground 
material on a surface in motion, against which surface a movably mounted measuring roller 

(32) is placed so that during the movement of the surface which is provided with the layer 
the excursion of the measuring roller (32) transverse to the direction of movement of the 

surface is detected by a sensor (34) which generates an output signal, wherein a parameter 
of this output signal bears a functional relationship to the magnitude of the excursion of the 

measuring roller (32) or to the layer thickness, characterised in that the measuring roller (32) 
is subjected to a braking force while it rolls on the layer to be measured. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that at least one of the following 
features is provided: 


a) a signal which depends on the rotational speed is generated and the braking 
force for the measuring roller (32) is regulated depending on this signal; 
b) the measuring roller (32) is motor-driven at a lower speed than the speed 
of movement of the layer or of the surface which is provided. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the output signal of the 
sensor (34) is filtered, and that the magnitude of the ripple is preferably determined and 

evaluated and is advantageously indicated when a threshold value is exceeded. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the output 
signal of the sensor (34) is stored before the layer is present or arises on the surface in 

motion and during the presence of the layer on the surface in motion it is compared at least 
periodically with the previously stored signal, and that the result of the comparison is 

preferably utilised thereafter for one of the following steps: regulating the speed of movement 
of the surface carrying the layer, regulating the amount of ground material which is fed,  

 
regulating the pressure, temperature or viscosity of the ground material, protecting the rolls 

from running dry by switching off when approaching or reaching the zero point position, 
and/or for indicating the thickness of the layer. 
A device for carrying out the method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein 
at least one measuring roller (32) is provided which can move against a load transverse to 

the direction of movement of a surface, such as the cylindrical surface of a roll (5) of a roller 
mill (WW), with which measuring roller an electronic sensor (34) is associated which detects 

its movement and/or its position at least according to its height above the surface (5) in 
motion, characterised in that a braking device (37) is associated with each measuring roller 

(32), the braking force of which braking device can preferably be regulated depending on the 
speed of movement of the surface of the roll (5) or of the measuring roller (32). 
A device according to claim 5, characterised in that in addition to being mounted so 
that it can move towards the surface of the roll (5), the measuring roller (32) is also mounted 

so that it can move transverse thereto, and that for this purpose a bearing lever preferably 
extends in front of the roll (5) in the direction of movement of the surface of the roll (5) so 

that the measuring roller (32) can be driven by the roll (5) with lag. 
A layer thickness measuring device according to claim 6, characterised in that each 
measuring roller (32) is coupled rotationally fixed to a generator, the inductively produced 

braking moment of which is provided for the speed-dependent braking of the measuring roller 
(32). 
A device according to any one of claims 5 to 7, characterised in that the ratio of the 
width (B) of the circumferential area of each measuring roller (32) on the contact area on the 

layer or on the roll (5) to its diameter (D) is less than 1:5, particularly less than 1:10, and/or 
that two measuring rollers (32) are provided, which can also preferably be moved, against 

a spring force for example, transverse to the direction of movement of the surface, such as 
the cylindrical surface of a roll (5) of a roller mill (WW), with which measuring rollers an 

electronic sensor (34) is associated, which sensor detects their movement and/or their 
position at least according to their height above the roll (5).  

 
A layer thickness measuring device according to any one of claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that the output signal of the sensor (34) is fed via a filter (42;42') to an 

evaluation stage (43; 48-51), and that the output signal of the sensor (34) is preferably fed 
via a low-pass filter (42) or a band-pass filter (42') for the reduction or elimination of ripples 

in the signal caused by any eccentricities of the roll (5) and/or of the layer. 
A layer thickness measuring device according to any one of claims 5 to 9, 
characterised in that the evaluation device has a change-over stage (45) for feeding the signal 

derived from the sensor (34) alternatively to a memory device (RAM) or to a comparator 
device (47), to which change-over device firstly the signal which can be read out from the 

memory device (RAM) can be fed and to which secondly the temporally relevant signal 
derived from the output signal of the sensor (34) can be fed, that an input of the controller 

(22) for at least one parameter for controlling the roller mill (WW) is preferably connected 
to the output of the comparator device (47), and that a selector switch (58) is optionally 

provided. which is provided for operating the change-over device (45) depending on the 
operating state of the roller mill (WW) such as normal operation or start-up or run-out 

operation.
