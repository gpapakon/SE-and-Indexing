<ABSTRACT>
The seal between the body and the lid of a preserving jar, especially one of made of glass, is formed by a washer (1) which includes an external lateral gripping projection (2) and two zones of weakness (L1, L2) located on either side of the lateral gripping projection (2), each extending from the outer peripheral edge to the inner peripheral edge, or near to this inner peripheral edge, of the washer (1). The lateral projection (2) and that part (2a) of the washer (1) located between the two zones of weakness (L1, L2) and the rest of the washer (1) are made of two materials having different characteristics, the two zones (L1, L2) being formed at the junction of these two materials.

A gasket for sealing-tightness between the body and lid of a preserves jar, 
particularly of glass, the gasket being formed by a ring made from a flexible material and 

which comprises a lateral gripping projection and a first zone of weakened resistance 
different from that of the material of which the ring is constituted, this first zone extending 

from a connecting point between the lateral projection and the ring and as far as or close 
to the inner periphery of the ring, characterised in that the ring comprises a second 

weakened zone (L2) similar to the first weakened zone (L1), the said two zones (L1, L2) 
being situated one on either side of the lateral gripping projections (2). 
A seal according to claim 1, characterised in that the lateral gripping projection 
(2) and the part (2a) of the ring (1) situated between the two weakened zones (L1, L2) 

are of a material having characteristics which differ from the material of which the rest of 
the ring (1) is formed, the two weakened zones (L1, L2) being constituted by the two 

junction lines between the two materials. 
A seal according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that it comprises at least one 
complementary zone of weakness (5, 6) formed in the vicinity of the inner periphery of 

the ring (1). 
A seal according to claim 3, characterised in that the complementary zone of 
weakness (5) is formed by a notch provided on the inner periphery of the ring (1). 
A seal according to claim 3, characterised in that the complementary zone of 
weakness is formed by a cut-out (6) such as a hole made in the vicinity of the inner 

periphery of the ring (1). 
A seal according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the complementary zone 
of weakness (5, 6) is filled with a filling material. 
A seal according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
lateral gripping projection (2) is extended by an elbow (2b).
