<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a molecule comprising a peptide having the amino acid sequence lysine-proline-cysteine-valine-lysine-leucine-threonine-proline-leucine-cysteine-valine (Seq.Id.No.1), wherein each cysteine residue is disulphide bridged to a further cysteine residue or is derivatised to simulate part of a disulphide bond, or functionally equivalent variants of such a peptide which mimic the immunogenic behaviour of an epitope of gp120 of HIV env. The sequence is highly conserved, being totally conserved in all listed isolates of HIV-1 and HIV-2, and undergoes only minor changes in isolates of SIV. With each cysteine residue contributing to a respective disulphide bridge (actual or simulated by suitable derivatisation), the molecule accurately mimics behaviour of the corresponding sequence of gp120 and elicits an immune response. The molecule can thus be used as the basis of a potential vaccine against AIDS and AIDS related conditions, and may find use in the treatment of AIDS and related conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title PEPTIDES THAT MIMIC GP120 HIV EPITOPE.Field of the InventionThis invention concerns developments relating to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV).Background to the InventionThe envelope glycoprotein (env) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is highly variable between independent isolates (reference 1) and this variation is even more marked between HIV-1 and HIV-2(2). This variation is seen not only between independent isolates, but also for sequential isolates of virus from an individual patient (3, 4). Not surprisingly, similar sequence variation has been observed between the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) and also within SIV even when isolated from the same species of simian (5-7).Not only is the variation greater in the envelope glycoprotein than in other gene products of HIV, but even within this one protein the variation is concentrated into specific variable regions (mostly in the surface portion (gp120) generated by the proteolytic maturation of the initial gene product) , with other regions being less variable (8, 9). Unfortunately the most variable regions are often also the most immunogenic (10), so that the virus partially evades the host's immune response andSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

establishes a persistent infection.This variability presents problems for diagnostic techniques based upon specific interactions, with separate or mixed reagents usually being employed to test samples for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. This variability also presents problems for any possible vaccine or immune therapy, since any suitable agent will have to give a response towards the many variant virus strains as well as towards HIV-1 and HIV-2.The present invention is based on the discovery by the inventors of a hitherto unrecognised highly conserved undecapeptide in gp 120 of env, starting from position 122 (on our alignment of HIV-1 env sequences), which is present in HIV-1 , HIV-2 and also SIV. This sequence is totally conserved as Lys-Pro-Cys-Val-Lys-Leu-Thr-Pro-Leu- Cys-Val (Seq. Id. No. 1, also referred to as sequence A) in all listed isolates of both types of HIV, including the "highly divergent" HIV-2 isolates D194 and D205 (11), and only undergoes conservative changes at the threonine and second valine in all isolates of SIV except in the highly divergent African mandrill isolate (12) wherein threonine and both leucines are mutated.In this specification amino acids are either identified by their full names, by conventional 3 letter abbreviations or by conventional 1 letter symbols, as listed in
