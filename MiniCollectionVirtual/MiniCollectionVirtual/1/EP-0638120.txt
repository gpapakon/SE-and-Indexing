<ABSTRACT>
DNA comprising tissue specific regulatory regions are disclosed. The DNA is useful in conjunction with other gene sequences for introduction into plant cells to provide transformed plants having tissues with a modified phenotypic property. The invention is exemplified with tomato fruit specific promoters which are active at climacteric and throughout the stages of fruit ripening.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TISSUE-SPECIFIC AND DEVELOPMENTALLY REGULATED TRANSCRIPTIONAL SEQUENCES AND USES THEREOF5 FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to plant biotechnology and specifically to DNA sequences capable of directing tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression of gene fusion constructs in transgenic plants. 10 INTRODUCTIONDevelopment of new crop plants through traditional plant breeding methods relies upon the observation of plant characteristics (phenotypes) and studies of their inheritance. Plant breeders have identified numerous desirable phenotypes and, through controlled breeding efforts,15 transferred these phenotypes into commercial plant varieties. However, in the process of transferring desirable phenotypes, undesirable phenotypes also can be transferred. Breeders must then perform numerous procedures which eventually remove all but the desired phenotype. As a result, the effort required to transfer a single trait may take from five to twenty-five years. This20 major limitation of conventional breeding techniques can be overcome by applying the techniques of molecular biology and plant tissue culture.Plants are highly evolved multicellular organisms. The hereditary material of plants, deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA, is contained within chromosomes which are comprised of genes encoding proteins. The specificity25 of expression of each gene is controlled by a regulatory region (__-., a transcriptional initiating sequence or promoter) associated with it. The gene is transcribed into ribonucleic acid (RNA) which is then translated into protein.</> Proteins are key molecules in the plant cell, comprising enzymes which control biochemical events and structural molecules which provide a framework for30 cell components.The production of transgenic plants begins with the introduction of new genetic material into a single plant cell. The next step, the production 

 of a whole, transgenic plant, is greatly facilitated by the fact that plants, unlike most animals, can be regenerated asexually from such a single cell or a small piece of tissue.Genetic engineering of plants is accomplished by isolating and characterizing genes of interest, splicing them to desirable promoters, and transferring them to plant cells or tissues which are then regenerated to produce transgenic plants. As a result of this process, the transgenic plants contain the transferred genetic information in their chromosomes. This genetic information is inherited in subsequent generations and confers a new phenotype upon
