<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to reversing the trend 
in conventional video printing by providing a cost-effective, 

flexible device (200) which is independent of a printing 
device (106) and which can respond to any of numerous highly 

accurate trigger signals (328) for capturing a video image. 
Exemplary embodiments can be used with any conventional 

computer printing device to provide plain paper prints (602) 
of video images. By focusing on optimizing cost-effectiveness 

and system flexibility rather than providing high resolution 
photographic quality prints, the present invention can provide 

video printing features never before realized. Exemplary 
embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and 

apparatus (200) for processing an input video data stream 
(104) by receiving the input video data stream, and by 

automatically controlling processing of at least a portion of 
a video frame in response to a predetermined condition of the 

input video data stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
video printing, and more particularly, to printing 
video images on a printable medium. Video printers for producing photographic-like 
images from a video input are known. These devices 
produce high resolution images on a medium such as 
thermal paper. For example, a video printer is described in a 
brochure entitled, "Color Video Printer UP-5100/UP-5150" 
available from Sony Corp. A brochure 
entitled, "Near Photographic Quality Color Prints 
From A Variety of Video Sources" describes a Color 
Video Printer UP-3000 also available from Sony Corp. 
The video printers as described in these brochures 
are directed to providing high quality prints of 
video images on photographic-like paper. A brochure 
entitled, "CP-110U Color Video Printer," and a 
brochure entitled, "CP-210U Large Format Color Video 
Printer," both available from Mitsubishi, describe 
similar devices for producing high resolution prints 
of video images on photographic-like paper. Despite their apparent appeal, conventional 
video printers have only realized limited commercial 
use. This is because conventional video printers 
reflect the trend to focus on producing high 
resolution prints of near photographic quality 
without regard to commercial practicality. 
Accordingly, conventional video printers suffer 
significant drawbacks which are believed to have 
resulted in their commercial impracticality. For  
 
example, in addition to being expensive to purchase 
and use, conventional video printers can not 
accurately capture a given video frame; rather, 
activation of a print button on the video printer 
results in a capture and print of whatever frame 
happens to be in a frame buffer at a given time. In general, the mechanism used to capture a 
frame of video data is typically a print key which 
acts as a command to store a frame of an input video 
signal, with the frame which is stored corresponding 
to the point and time at which the command is 
recognized by the video printer. A conventional 
video printer captures a video image (e.g., NTSC, 
PAL, SECAM, VGA format in either analog or digital), 
processes the video image for a target printer 
mechanism and prints the video image on 
photographic-like paper. Because the mechanism used to capture a frame 
of the input video signal is relatively inaccurate, 
numerous costly photographic-like prints must 
typically be obtained before a desired frame is 
captured and printed. Thus, conventional video 
printers are extremely limited in their

Method for processing a video data stream (104) 
received via an input (102), the method being characterized by 

a step of automatically controlling processing (200) of at 
least a portion of a video frame in response to a 

predetermined condition of the input video data stream. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein said step of 
automatically controlling is further characterized by steps of 

inputting a predetermined time code value; and controlling 
storage of said at least a portion of said video frame (304, 

602) as a printable video image (600) when a time code value 
associated with said input video data stream matches said 

predetermined time code value, or when a derived time code 
value from said input video data stream matches said 

predetermined time code value. 
Method according to Claim 2, further characterized by 
a step of reading said derived time code from a vertical 

synchronization interval of said video data stream (500), or 
from a longitudinal time code. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein said step of 
automatically controlling is further characterized by steps of 

selecting a predetermined time interval (500); and controlling 
storage of said at least a portion of said video frame as a 

printable video image when said predetermined interval has 
elapsed during receipt of said input video data stream. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein said step of 
automatically controlling is further characterized by steps of 

examining at least portions of at least two frames of said 
input video data stream to detect said predetermined condition 

by detecting changes in characteristics of pixels included in 
a first of said at least two frames relative to a second of 

said at least two frames; and controlling storage of said at 
least a portion of said video frame as a printable video image 

upon detecting said predetermined condition. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein said step of 
automatically controlling further is further characterized by 

steps of pre-storing at least a portion of a reference video 
frame; comparing said at least a portion of said video frame 

to said at least a portion of the reference video frame to 
detect a match between said video frame and said reference 

video frame; and controlling storage of said at least a 
portion of said video frame as a printable video image if a 

match exists between said video frame and said reference video 
frame. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein said step of 
automatically controlling is further characterized by steps of 

examining an audio signal associated with said video frame; 
and controlling storage of said at least a portion of said 

 
video frame as a printable video image upon detecting a 

predetermined condition of said audio signal. 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein said step of 
automatically controlling is further characterized steps of
