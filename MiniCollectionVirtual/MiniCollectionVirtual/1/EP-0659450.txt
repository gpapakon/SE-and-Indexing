<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed in which a chloroorganic compound 
is decomposed by means of a microorganism. The relevant 

microorganisms are induced to do so by contact with an 
aromatic compound which may be extracted from a plant 

containing lignocellulose or may be p-coumaric acid. It 
is believed that these compounds stimulate the 

microorganism to express oxygenase, and that the presence 
of oxygenase in the microroganism enables it to decompose 

the chlororoganic compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
decomposing a chloroorganic compound, in particular,
dichloroethylene or trichloroethylene, using a
microorganism which can decompose said compound. In
particular it can provide a process for decomposing the
chloroorganic compound safely and easily by inducing the
microorganism to decompose said compound by exposure of
said microorganism to a harmless naturally occurring
compound. The present process can be used to upgrade an
open environment polluted with the chloroorganic
compound. It is therefore applicable to the disposal of
an effluent or treatment of soil to reduce the content
of chloroorganic pollutants.In recent years, environmental pollution by chloroorganic
compounds which are harmful to living organisms and are
difficult to decompose has become a major problem. In
particular soil around paper and pulp manufacturing
plants or around industry that uses precision machines
has become prone to pollution with chloroorganic
compounds, such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and
dichloroethylene (DCE). Pollution with such compounds
has been found sometimes to have become spread over a
wide area, and these compounds are detected in many
environmental surveys. Chloroorganic compounds persist
in soil and become dissolved in groundwater as rain falls
on the polluted sites, which further increases the effect 
of the pollution. Because chloroorganic compounds are
quite stable in the environment, pollution of groundwater
which is used as a source of drinking water has become
a social problem.Various methods have been put forward for removing
chloroorganic compounds from process screams in industry.
For example, an absorption disposal method using
activated carbon has been suggested, and it has also been
suggested to decompose organochlorine compounds using
heat or radiation. However, these methods are too costly
to be practical.In recent years, it has been reported that the volatile
chloroorganic compounds, such as TCE etc, which are
stable under environmental conditions can be decomposed
by a microorganism, and research aimed at developing a
practical process using a microorganism has been carried
out. The decomposition of a chloroorganic compound
requires the microorganism to be exposed to a compound 
(hereinafter called an "inducible" compound) which
induces it to make the enzyme oxygenase, the presence of
that enzyme in the microorganism also giving the
microorganism the capacity to decompose the chloroorganic
compound. About a dozen different species of bacteria
