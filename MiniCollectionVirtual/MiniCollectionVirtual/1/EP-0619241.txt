<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a venting cap or container which comprises a 
lateral wall (3) which is perforated and an elastic band (5) which 

covers said perforations (4) on the outside of said lateral wall. 
According to the present invention, the extra pressure is released 

through said perforations (4) in said lateral wall (3) as said elastic 
band (5) expands elastically.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a venting cap or container 
for containing viscous or liquid products. The present 
invention relates more particularly to a cap or container 
which allows an automatic escape of excess pressure 
generated inside said container. Containers for containing viscous or liquid products have 
been extensively described in the art as well as their 
numerous possible applications. Some food products like 
fruits juices tend to ferment rather rapidly after the 
containers in which they are packaged have been opened. 
The fermentation involves gases which cause internal gas 
pressure to increase, especially if there is relatively 
little "head space" above the level of the food product in 
the container. Apart from fermentation, excessively high 
internal gas pressure in a container can arise in other 
ways, for example by the release of gaseous oxygen provided 
by the slow decomposition of hypochlorite or other bleaches 
or because of an increase of temperature.  Such a phenomenon can create safety issues in that the 
pressure which builds up inside a hermetically closed 
container might cause the closure of said container to blow 
therefrom. Also, if the container is made of plastic 
material, it can be deformed sufficiently to render it 
commercially unacceptable from a consumer's viewpoint. In the art, solutions to these problems have been proposed, 
for instance by designing containers of specific shapes, 
whereby the container has optimal resistance to pressure 
build-up, limiting the degree of deformation. This type of 
solution has the drawback that it limits the flexibility of 
shape, material selection and material thickness when 
designing such containers. Other solutions relate to various venting caps for such 
containers, which allow the gas generated inside the 
container to escape. Such caps have been described for 
instance in EP-B-0 187 106 issued September 21, 1988 and 
entitled "A device for the sealing of containers, having a 
valve to allow the automatic escape of gases under excess 
pressure", in GB-2 170 790 issued August 3, 1988 and 
entitled "Hand-held dispenser with automatic venting" and 
in WO-91 03406, entitled "Pressure venting closure". 
These venting caps have the drawback that they are rather 
complicated in structure and thus involve expensive 
manufacturing. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a venting cap or container. It is a further object 
of the present invention to provide a venting cap which is 
more simple than
