<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of fluxing, via a dry route, a metal surface before soldering or tinning using an alloy, in which the surface to be fluxed is treated, at a pressure close to atmospheric pressure, by a gaseous treatment atmosphere comprising excited or unstable species and being substantially devoid of electrically charged species, which gaseous treatment atmosphere is obtained from a primary gas mixture (8) and, as the case may be, an adjacent gas mixture (9, 10), the primary gas mixture being obtained at the gas outlet of at least one apparatus (11, 4, 12) for forming excited or unstable gaseous species, in which has been converted an initial gas mixture (7) comprising an inert gas and/or a reducing gas and/or an oxidising gas, the adjacent gas mixture not having passed through the apparatus.
