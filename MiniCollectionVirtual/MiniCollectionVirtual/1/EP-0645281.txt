<ABSTRACT>
A stanchion (1) is described having tolerance-compensating means for a rail tube (5) of a roof rail which is to be arranged on the motor vehicle; a supporting surface (3) supported by the roof (2); an insertion pin (4) which is at a vertical and lateral distance from the latter and is intended to establish a plug-in connection between one end of the rail tube and the stanchion (1); and a hollow chamber (6) which extends into the stanchion (1) from the supporting surface (3) and into which there engages the dome (11) of an adapter (9) which is fastened to the vehicle roof (2) and has a recess (14) for accommodating a threaded plate (15) which is shorter than the former and which can be longitudinally displaced within the recess (14) and is provided with a groove (17) on the top for establishing a positive connection to a cam (18) which is formed on the upper wall of the hollow chamber of the stanchion (1), it being possible to fasten the stanchion (1) to the adapter (9) by means of a fastening screw (19) which is aligned approximately parallel to its supporting surface (3) and which penetrates a bore (7), which opens out into the hollow chamber (6), in the stanchion (1), a slot-like aperture (21) in the dome (11) of the adapter (9) and a threaded bore (16) in the threaded plate (15).

Support bracket (1) for a railing tube (5) of a roof 
railing to be situated on a motor vehicle featuring 

a contact surface (3) resting on the roof (2), a 
spigot (4) at a vertical and lateral distance from 

the contact surface, forming a socket-like connection 
between an end of the railing tube and the 

support bracket (1), characterized by a hollow chamber 
(6) extending from the contact surface (3) inside 

the support bracket (1), into which projects 
the vertical tongue (11) of an adapter (9) attached 

to the vehicle roof, this tongue exhibiting a notch 
(14) to accept a threaded plate (15) shorter than 

the notch (14) and longitudinally shiftable within 
the notch (14), the top of this plate being provided 

with a groove (17) to create a positive-fit connection 
with a cam (18) on the upper hollow chamber 

wall of the support bracket (1), wherein the support 
bracket (1) can be secured on the adapter (9) by 

means of a fixing screw (19) aligned approximately 
parallel with the contact surface (3), this screw 

passing through a hole (7) which intersects the 
hollow chamber (6) in the bracket (1), a hole-like 

opening (21) in the vertical tongue (11) of the 
adapter (9) and a threaded hole (16) in the threaded 

plate (15). 
Support bracket in accordance with Claim 1, characterized 
by the groove (17) in the threaded plate 

(15) running parallel to the fixing screw (19) and 
being vee-shaped and by the cam (18) engaging with 

the groove (17) exhibiting a shape mating with the 
groove (17).
