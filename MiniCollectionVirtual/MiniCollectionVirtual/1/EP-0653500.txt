<ABSTRACT>
A chemical vapor deposition reactor (50) comprises in 
combination a nozzle (52) and means (54) for equalizing a 

reactant chemistry and a flux of reactants. The nozzle is 
disposed within a chamber (15) opposite a susceptor (14) upon 

which a substrate (56) is supported during chemical 
deposition of a film upon a surface of the substrate from a 

reactant gas released into the chamber by the nozzle. The 
nozzle comprises an inlet port (58) for receiving the 

reactant gas from a gas supply and an outlet port (60) for 
releasing the reactant gas therethrough. The equalizing 

means substantially equalizes a reactant chemistry and a flux 
of reactants uniformly across the surface of the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to improved apparatus 
for chemical vapor deposition, and more particularly, to an 
improved injector for use in such apparatus. The formation of thin films by chemical vapor deposition 
(CVD) and low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) 
continues to be a key process step in silicon based 
microelectronics and in the semiconductor industry. Many new 
processes utilize complex reagents, such as, metal organic 
precursors (i.e., metal organic CVD (MOCVD) reagents), in 
which respective chemical pathways for film formation are not 
yet well understood. Nominally, films formed from these 
complex reagents are deposited in single-wafer reactors, 
which in many instances, are primarily designed for the 
deposition of materials having less complex chemistries. 
Presently available reactors suffer from an inability to 
accommodate the new reagents and further suffer from the 
inability to achieve optimal film properties. Figs. 1 and 1A illustrate one type of prior art apparatus for 
forming CVD and LPCVD films on semiconductor wafer surfaces, 
such films as aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) or tungsten (W) films, 
for example. In this prior art apparatus, a single injector 
indicated by the general reference numeral 12 is located 
directly in front of a susceptor 14 and injects a vapor into 
a chamber 15. Undeposited vapor exits through a port 16 on 
an opposite side of the susceptor from the injector 12. The injector 12 has a generally unrestricted angular passage 
18 through which vapor flows from a plenum 20 into the 
chamber 15. A passage 11 connects the plenum to an external 
vapor supply. The passage 18 is formed between an outer ring 
22 and a central cylindrical member 24 that has a flat 
surface 25 forming a wall in front of the susceptor 14. The  
 
outer edge of the passage 18 is coextensive with the outer 
periphery of a wafer 26 held by the susceptor 14. The dashed 
arrows in the figure show generally the vapor flow path. The apparatus of the type illustrated in Fig. 1 exhibits a 
major shortcoming, namely, poor film thickness uniformity and 
uniformity of film properties across the surface of a single 
wafer for certain reactant gases. This is primarily due to 
non-uniform reactant chemistry and non-uniform flux of 
reactants in the reaction chamber during film deposition. To 
gain a better appreciation for the above, a reactant gas is 
a gas suitable for undergoing chemical reactions. Reactant 
chemistry is a series of chemical reactions or combination of 
chemi
