<DESCRIPTION>
 IMMEDIATE EARLY HSV-2 VIRAL PROTEIN ICP27 AS VACCINEThe present invention relates to therapeutic and prophylatic vaccines, novel antigens for use in such vaccine(s), methods for their preparation and their use in human medicine. In particular the present invention relates to antigens from Herpes Simplex (HSV) capable of stimulating a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response.HSV causes lifelong infection and recurrent disease in man. There are two closely related serotypes of HSV, these are known as HSV-1 and HSV-2 respectively. In primary infections, after replication at a skin or mucosal site, the virus moves to the dorsal root ganglia and usually enters a latent phase. Reactivations then occur after appropriate stimuli, resulting in vesicles and ulcers at the mucocutaneous sites innervated by the ganglia. While neutralizing antibodies are shown to protect against primary infection and disease, their presence has no effect on the course or frequency of recurrent herpetic disease. T cell mediated immune responses, particularly of the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) or cytolytic (CTL) effector types have also been shown to protect against primary disease in mouse animal models. Furthermore, individuals with compromised T cell functions may undergo severe and sometimes life-threatening herpetic disease. These observations suggest a central role for effector T cell functions in control of herpes virus infections in man. The major surface glycoproteins of Herpes Simplex Virus, gD and gC have been suggested for use in vaccines (EP 139417 Genentech). These primarily stimulate a neutralising antibody response.Since the mechanism of antigen recognition by CTL involves breakdown of native antigen into peptides, binding of the proteolytic fragments to MHC molecules and export of the complex to the cell surface, any virus coded polypeptide not just those that are integral membrane proteins like the glycoproteins, can be a potential target of T cell mediated responses. However since the HSV genome codes for several non structural proteins and internal virion proteins, in addition to external glycoproteins, this results in a large number of potential CTL targets and it is not known which protein would be the most relevant.HSV infection is characterized by minimal presence of free virus. During latency and reactivation virus is mainly intracellular. Accordingly, recurrent disease is not prevented even by high levels of neutralizing antibodies and virus control depends on cell πr stated immunity. In order to obtain
