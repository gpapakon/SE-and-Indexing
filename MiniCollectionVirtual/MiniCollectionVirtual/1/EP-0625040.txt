<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are shampoo premix compositions, shampoo compositions made therefrom, and methods of making such premixes and shampoos thereof. The shampoo premix comprises alkyl ethoxylated sulfate surfactant, a specific type of imidazolinium amphoteric surfactant, polyethylene glycol glyceryl fatty ester nonionic surfactant, a suspending agent that is solubilized and recrystallized in the premix composition at pH less than 7.0, and a sufficient amount of a pH adjustor, i.e., an acid, to adjust pH to less than 7.0 during recrystallisation of the composition. The shampoo premix hereof can be used as an end product, or used as a base from which to add additional shampoo ingredients to form a finished shampoo formulation. The shampoo premix hereof can provide mild, good lathering, pearlescent compositions. The premix compositions hereof are particularly useful for use in conditioning shampoo compositions containing silicone conditioning agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SHAMPOO PREMIX COMPOSITIONSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention is related to shampoo premix composi¬ tions as well as finished shampoo compositions comprising the premix and additional shampoo components and/or additional levels of components also included in the premix. The present invention also relates to a method of making said shampoo premix and shampoo compositions.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMild shampoo compositions which provide low irritation to the skin are highly desirable. Conventional shampoos contain high levels of harsh anionic surfactants. These materials can penetrate the skin and destroy its integrity. This results, at the very least, in rough skin, and can ultimately lead to red, irritated skin. Ideal shampoo compositions should provide sufficient lathering and cleaning benefits to cleanse the hair while at the same time causing little or no irritation to the skin. This is particularly essential for shampoo compositions used on babies, small children, or adults with dry or sensitive skin. Furthermore, children can have difficulty if they get shampoo in their eyes during the hair washing or rinsing process. Hence, mild shampoo compositions which also provide reduced eye sting are particularly desirable for use on children.Mild shampoo compositions, in general, are well known in the art having been taught in, for example, European Patent Application 0250181, published December 23, 1987; U.S. Patent 4,578,216, Fujii et al., issued March 25, 1986; U.S. Patent 4,726,915, Verdicchio, issued February 23, 1988; U.K. Patent Specification 1,508,929, published April 26, 1978; European Patent Application 0160269, published November 6, 1985; U.S. Patent 4,435,300, Guth et al., issued March 6, 1984; U.S. Patent 4,426,310, Vernunica, issued January 17, 1984; U.S. Patent 

3,950,417, Verdicchio et al . , issued April 13, 1976; U.S. Patent 4,443,362, Guth et al . , issued April 17, 1984; U.S. Patent 4,654,207, Preston, issued March 31, 1987; U.S. Patent 4,851,154, Grollier et al . , issued July 25, 1989; U.S. Patent 4,292,212, Melby, issued September 29, 1981; and U.S. Patent 4,329,334, Su et al., issued May 11, 1982. These references teach the use of a wide variety of surfactant combinations to achieve mildness. These surfactants include mild anionic surfactants, such as ethoxylated alky! sulfates, a photeric surfactants, nonionic surfactants, and various combinations thereof.One well-known mild shampoo is Johnson's Baby Shampoo (John¬ son & Johnson). This product contains high levels of nonionic
