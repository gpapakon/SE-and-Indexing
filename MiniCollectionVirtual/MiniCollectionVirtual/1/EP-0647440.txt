<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rehabilitating 
apparatus, more particularly to a rehabilitating 
apparatus for an injured leg. A conventional rehabilitating apparatus for an 
injured leg includes an L-shaped rigid plate which 
conforms substantially to the injured leg for receiving 
the same and which has two opposite faces and two 
opposite longitudinal peripheral edges; means for 
limiting lateral movement transverse to and between the 
longitudinal peripheral edges of the L-shaped rigid 
plate, thereby confining the injured leg to a 
predetermined position on one of the opposite faces; 
and means for securing the injured leg to the L-shaped 
rigid plate. A main drawback of the conventional apparatus for 
rehabilitating an injured leg is that the L-shaped 
rigid plate is cumbersome and cannot be folded in order 
to minimize the size thereof so as to facilitate 
packaging, storage and transport the same. A main objective of the present invention is to 
provide a rehabilitating apparatus for an injured leg 
which can be disassembled into pieces so as to minimize  
 
its size, thereby facilitating packaging, storage and 
transport of the same. A second objective of the present invention is to 
provide an apparatus which is constituted by a rigid 
main support plate and a rigid foot support plate which 
is attached detachably to the main support plate so as 
to form an L-shaped member. A third objective of the present invention is to 
provide a rehabilitating apparatus which is adjustable 
so that it can be employed to any injured leg so as to 
rehabilitate the latter regardless of the width and the 
length of the leg. Accordingly, the rehabilitating apparatus for an 
injured leg includes an elongated rigid main support 
plate for supporting a calf of the leg, the main 
support plate having a top end, a bottom end, two 
opposed faces and a first engaging unit formed at the 
bottom end; an elongated auxiliary cushioning plate; 
means for fastening the auxiliary cushioning plate 
detachably and removably to the top end of the main 
support plate and for permitting the auxiliary 
cushioning plate to extend beyond the top end of the 
main support plate along a longitudinal direction of 
the latter to vary a combined length of the main 
support plate and the auxiliary cushioning plate; a 
rigid foot support plate conforming substantially to a 
foot and having a first end and a second end with a  
 
second engaging unit which is engageable detachably 
with the first engaging unit of the main support plate 
to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg, 
comprising: 

   an elongated rigid main support plate for 
supporting a calf of said injured leg, said main 

support plate having a top end, a bottom end, two 
opposed faces and a first engaging unit formed at said 

bottom end; 
   an elongated auxiliary cushioning plate; 

   means for fastening said auxiliary cushioning 
plate detachably and removably along said top end of 

said main support plate and for permitting said 
auxiliary cushioning plate to extend beyond said top 

end in a longitudinal direction of said main support 
plate to vary a combined length of said main support 

plate and said auxiliary cushioning plate; 
   a rigid foot support plate conforming substantially 

to a foot and having a front end and a rear end with a 
second engaging unit which is engageable detachably 

with said first engaging unit of said main support 
plate to connect said foot support plate and said main 

support plate to form an L-shaped member; and 
   means for securing the foot and the calf when the 

injured leg is provided on said L-shaped member, said 
securing means including a plurality of fastening 

straps. 
The apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg as 
 

defined in Claim 1, wherein said fastening means 
includes a row of aligned holes which are formed at 

said top end of said main support plate and which 
extend along said longitudinal length of said main 

support plate, a plurality of aligned slots which are 
formed adjacent to a lower end of said auxiliary 

cushioning plate and which extend along a longitudinal 
length of said auxiliary cushioning plate, and a 

plurality of screw fasteners. 
The apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg as 
defined in Claim 1, wherein said main support plate 

further includes an opening adjacent to said first 
engaging unit. 
The apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg as 
defined in Claim 1, wherein said first engaging unit 

includes a curved piece formed integrally at the bottom 
end of said main support plate, said curved piece 

having two opposed ends, an internal face and an 
external face, a pair of plug members being extending 

respectively from said opposed ends, and a curved 
insert piece integrally formed on said internal face of 

said curved piece, said second engaging unit including 
a recess formed at said rear end of said foot support 

plate and two opposed socket members located on two 
sides of said recess and capable of engaging said plug 

members when said insert piece is inserted into said 
recess. 
The apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg as 
defined in Claim 1, wherein said first engag
ing unit 
includes a curved piece integrally formed at the bottom 

end of said main support plate, said curved piece 
having two opposed ends, an internal face, an external 

face, a pair of connecting stubs extending respectively 
from said opposed ends, and a curved insert piece 

integrally formed on said internal face of said curved 
piece, each of said connecting stubs having a mounting 

hole, said second engaging unit including a recess that 
is formed at said rear end of said foot support plate, 

a through-hole formed transversely through a 
longitudinal length of said foot support plate and 

located adjacent to said recess in alignment with said 
mounting holes of said connecting stubs, and a screw 

fastener which is capable of extending through said 
mounting holes and said through-hole, thereby 

preventing said main support plate from disengaging 
said foot support plate when said curved insert piece 

is inserted into said recess of said foot support 
plate. 
The apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg as 
defined in Claim 1, wherein said first engaging unit 

includes a curved insert piece with two opposed 
connecting stubs, each of which having a mounting hole, 

said second engaging unit including a recess formed at 
said rear end of said foot support plate, two opposed 

 
threaded blind holes which are formed in said foot 

support plate adjacent to said recess, and a pair of 
screw fasteners which are capable of extending through 

said mounting holes in said connecting stubs so as to 
be threaded in said threaded blind bores, thereby 

preventing said main support plate from disengaging 
said foot support plate when said insert piece is 

inserted into said recess of said foot support plate. 
The apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg as 
defined in Claim 1, wherein said foot support plate 

includes a first section, a second section and means 
for connecting said first and second sections to permit 

varying of a longitudinal length of said foot support 
plate, each of said first and second sections further 

having two opposed longitudinal peripheral edges, two 
opposed vertical positioning rods fixed symmetrically 

on each of said first and second sections along said 
longitudinal peripheral edges, and two L-shaped 

connecting members disposed on each of said first and 
second sections, each of said L-shaped connecting 

members including a first part contacting a respective 
one of said first and second sections and having an 

elongated first slot which extends transverse to said 
longitudinal length of said rigid foot support plate 

and which permits said vertical positioning rod to 
extend therethrough to prevent said L-shaped connecting 

member from disengaging a respective one of said first 
 

and second sections, and a second part which is 
substantially perpendicular to said first part, said 

second part having a second elongated slot that is 
parallel to said longitudinal length of said foot 

support plate, each said L-shaped connecting member 
being connected resiliently to another one of said L-shaped 

connecting members. 
The apparatus for rehabilitating an injured leg as 
defined in Claim 7, wherein said foot support plate 

further includes two cover members capable of covering 
threadedly a respective one of said first and second
