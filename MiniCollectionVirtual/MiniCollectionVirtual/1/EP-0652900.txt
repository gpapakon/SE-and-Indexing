<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel polypeptides with antithrombin activity obtainable from extracts of tissues or secretions of leeches of the order Rhynchobdellida, particularly of the species Theromyzon tessulatum. The polypeptides have molecular weights of about 14 kD, 9 kD and 3 kD and can be used in pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of thrombosis related disorders and events.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel thrombin inhibitors and, in
particular, thrombin inhibitors derived from leech tissue and leech
secretions.Thrombin catalyzes the formation of fibrin clots and inhibits, therefore,
the coagulation of blood. Moreover, thrombin has several other
bioregulatory roles such as the direct activation of platelet
aggregation and the activation of inflammatory response by
stimulating the synthesis of platelet activating factor (PAF) by
endothelial cells. That means that thrombin plays a central role in
thrombosis related disorders such as cardiovascular desease, for
example.
Consequently, there is a great interest in a continual search for new
or improved thrombin inhibotors and anticoagulants, respectively.Examples of well known thrombin inhibitors are heparin and hirudin.Heparin accelerates the anticoagulant activity of antithrombin III. It
has been widely used to treat conditions, such as venous
thromboembolism, in which thrombin activity is responsible for the
development or expansion of a thrombus. It is not effective for
therapy in the cases where antithrombin III is decreased, for example
in the cases of thrombosis associated with nephrosis or disseminated
intravascular coagulation syndrome (DIC). Moreover, heparin
produces many undesirable side effects, including hemorrhaging and
thrombocytopenia.Hirudin is a well known and well characterized polypeptide, which is
known to be specific for thrombin, and which may be isolated from 
extracts of the salivary gland and other tissues of leeches of the
species Hirudo medicinalis. Hirudin and its derivatives are also
obtainable by recombinant techniques.The polypeptide has a
relatively low molecular weight of 7000 D and is comprised of 65
amino acids. The amino acid sequence of hirudin was first
determined by Dodt et al. (FEBS Letters, 165, 180-184, 1984). Three
major variants of hirudin (HV1, HV2, HV3) have been found in the
medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis and differ in only about 10% of the
total amino acid positions.The most notable difference is at the first
two positions of the N-terminal end of the molecule: Val-Val in hirudin
variant 1 (HV1) and lle-Thr in hirudin variant 2 (HV2). These
differences are of minor nature and do not affect the function nor the
specificity of hirudin-thrombin interaction. Hirudin is a potent natural
inhibitor of coagulation. It has demonstrated efficacy in preventing
venous thrombosis, vascular shunt occlusion and thrombin-induced
disseminated intravascular coagulation, but shows,
