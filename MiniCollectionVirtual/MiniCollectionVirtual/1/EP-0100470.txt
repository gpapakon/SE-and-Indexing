<ABSTRACT>
A heat-resistant, wear-resistant and high-strength alumi­
num alloy powder is described which contains from approxi­

mately 10.0% to approximately 30.0% of silicon and at least 
one element selected from the group consisting of from 

approximately 5.0% to approximately 15.0% of nickel, from 
approximately 3.0% to approximately 15.0% of iron, and 

from approximately 5.0% to approximately 15.0% of man­
ganese, the silicon crystals in the aluminum alloy powder 

being 15 µm or less in size. Due to the content of nickel, iron, 
and manganese, the matrix is hardened and strengthened by 

the presence of finely dispersed intermetallic compounds 
and the silicon crystals. 
Further, a shaped body, e.g., a hot-extruded shaped 
body, is described comprising an aluminum alloy powder 

having the above composition, the intermetallic compounds 
being 20 µm or less in size being finely distributed in the 

shaped body.
