<ABSTRACT>
A moving body discriminator has a data 
processor (100) for outputting a communication 

command; a plurality of controllers (101-10N) each 
connected to the data processor (100) and 

inputting the communication command outputted from 
the data processor (100) and outputting a 

predetermined instruction; a plurality of question 
antennas (111-11N) connected and corresponding to 

the plural controllers (101-10N) and inputting and 

outputting the predetermined instruction outputted 
from each of the corresponding controllers (101-10N); 

and a responder (120) for inputting the 
predetermined instruction by spatial transmission 

and outputting a specified signal to a question 
antenna outputting the predetermined instruction. 

The plural controllers (101-10N) control 
operations of the plural question antennas (111-11N) 

such that the plural controllers (101-10N) 
sequentially operate the plural question antennas 

(111-11N) in a predetermined order to communicate 
with the responder (120).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a moving
body discriminator using a moving body
discriminating controller and a question antenna.In a general moving body discriminator, a
plurality of controllers (question antennas) are
connected to one data processor. This moving body
discriminator uses a so-called center polling
system.In the general moving body discriminator, the
plural controllers are connected to the data
processor through a serial network of a bus form
(a serial channel in the center polling system).
A station number is set in advance in each of the
controllers. The data processor mainly transmits
signals on lines. Commands for executing
communication between a controller of a station
number 1 and a responder are transmitted from the
data processor to this controller of station
number 1.Processings of the data processor in the 
above general discriminator will next be explained
with reference to a flow chart shown in Fig. 33.In a first step Z1, a controller of a station
number 1 operates a question antenna connected to
its own station to communicate with a responder.
Subsequently, in a step Z2, it is monitored by a
predetermined number of retries whether a response
from the responder is obtained or not.In the above step Z2, when no response from
the responder is obtained by a predetermined
number of retries, the controller of station
number 1 transmits a message of "no response from
the responder is obtained" to the data processor.
Otherwise, the data processor detects that there
is no response from this controller within a
predetermined time, and transmits commands for
communicating with the responder to a controller
of a station number 2 in a step Z3.Similarly, controllers of station numbers 2
to N are sequentially polled by the data processor
in steps Z4 to Z2N. In a step Z2N+1, a controller
succeeding in communicating with the responder
transmits communicating results between this
controller and the responder to the data
processor.The above processings will next be explained 
with reference to Figs. 34 and 35.An interrogator used in the above general
moving body discriminator sets an operating code
for each of reading and writing and an operating
range, etc. of a command 1 ○ for commanding an
operation of the responder by operational commands
from the data processor such as a personal
computer, a programmable controller, etc. The
interrogator then transmits this command 1 ○ to the
responder.When the responder has received the command
1 ○, the responder checks whether there is a
transmission
