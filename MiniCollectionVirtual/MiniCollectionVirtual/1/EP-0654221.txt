<CLAIMS>
Method for preparing cold water soluble instant black
tea characterized in that a mixture of black tea leaves and

green tea leaves is subjected to co-extraction with hot
water at a pressure of between 101.3 and 202.6 kPa (1-2

atmospheres), and the extract obtained is concentrated and
dried so as to obtain a cold water soluble tea powder.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that a

mixture of green tea and black tea is used in a weight
ratio of between 4:1 and 2:1.
Method according to either of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the mixture of green tea and black

tea is extracted at a temperature of between 90 and 130Â°C.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the extraction is carried out for a period of

between 2 and 30 minutes.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the tea mixture is extracted with 2 to 25 parts of

water per 1 part of tea.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized
in that the extract is concentrated so as to arrive at a

dry matter content of between 10 and 30 %.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized
in that the extraction is repeated a second time on

exhausted black tea leaves and green tea leaves before the
concentration step on the two extracts obtained.
