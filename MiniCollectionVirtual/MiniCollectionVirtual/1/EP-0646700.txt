and exhaust valves (1-1,1-2,2,) and a 
supply passage and a discharge passage for supplying and 

discharging, respectively, compressed air to each of said air 
chambers (S1,S2,S3). The engine is improved in that more than two intake 

valves (1-1,1-2) with associated air chambers (S1,S2)

of the invention, the engine is improved in that a plurality of 
cylinders are arranged in line, that the supply passage for 

the air chambers (S1,S2) associated with 
the intake valves (1-1,1-2) of each 

cylinder is communicated with the respective supply passages of

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an internal combustion engine of the
four cycle type according to the preamble of claim 1 or claim 2.The use of multiple valves and pneumatic valve systems is
known to the art as part of high rpm technology for 4 cycle
engines (eg. French Patent FR-2529616).The above mentioned pneumatic valve system employs air
springs, using compressed air rather than the coil springs used
in the dynamic valves of the prior art, and this feature improves
the timing-tracking ability of the air intake and exhaust valves
to keep pace with the engine at high rpm levels.The pneumatic valve systems of the prior art were equipped
with a pair of air intake valves and a pair of exhaust valves,
and the application of such a system was limited to this type of
so-called four valve engines. The below-described problems would
develop when attempts were made to adapt this design to a so--called
5-valve system comprised of three air intake valves and 2
exhaust valves.To wit, with four valve engine, it was possible to mount
a single control valve on the compressed air supply side and on
the discharge side, respectively, but with a five valve engine,
layout became difficult in that control valves had to be mounted
for each of the three air chambers on the intake side to supply 
compressed air under the same conditions, and the same problem
remained on the discharge side.Also, if the compressed air supply passages on the supply
side and the discharge passages were laid out linearly, parallel
to the crankshaft, interference between the various passages and
the spark plugs would force the spark plug to be tilted substantially
toward the exhaust side, and it would be necessary to
locate the air chamber some distance away from the spark plugs,
toward the outside of the engine, and such requirements would
make the engine larger.An internal combustion engine of the four cycle type comprising a pneumatic valve
system for biasing the intake and exhaust valves toward their closing position is
known from EP-A 0 536 513 disclosing the features of the preamble of claim 1 and 2. Said internal combustion engine uses two intake valves
and two exhaust valves per cylinder. Each valve is associated with an air spring being
part of the pneumatic valve system. Each air spring is defined by an air chamber and
an associated valve lifter which are integrally formed in one housing. Said housings
are located in a pressure chamber defining member which is located in the cylinder
head.It is an objective of the present invention to provide
