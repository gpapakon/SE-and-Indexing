<ABSTRACT>
The powder-actuated driving tool has a piston return mechanism operating through the use of compressed propellant gases. For this purpose, propellant gases pass from an opening (6) via a passage (5) through an opening (7) into the guide bore (2a) of a piston guide (2). The piston (1) is driven by the compressed propellant gases from its front end position into its rear initial position until it comes to bear on the base (4c) of a cartridge carrier (4). While the piston (1) comes to a stop, the cartridge carrier (4) is displaced to a limited extent against the driving direction. For this purpose, the cartridge carrier (4) is connected to a housing part (3) via a buttress thread (3a, 4a) exhibiting backlash.

Explosively actuated setting tool, comprising a piston guide (2) 
within the guide bore (2a) of which a piston (1) is driven by 

means of propellant gases of a propellant charge from a rear 
initial position from a cartridge carrier (4), which forms the rear 

stop of the piston (1), into a front end position, and between 
piston guide (2) and a housing element (3) which encases the 

latter is provided a channel (5), which is connected via openings 
(6, 7) in the area of the initial position and in the area of the end 

position of the piston (1), to the guide bore (2a), 
characterized 
in that
 the cartridge carrier (4) is displaceable to a limited 
extent relative to other elements of the device along the axis of 

the piston (1). 
Explosively actuated setting tool according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that
 the cartridge carrier (4) is displaceable to 
a limited extent relative to the housing element (3) which 

encases the piston guide (2) along the axis of the piston (1). 
Explosively actuated setting tool according to Claim 2, 

characterized in that
 a connection which permits said limited 
displaceability is provided between cartridge carrier (4) and 

housing element (3). 
Explosively actuated setting tool according to Claim 3, 

characterized in that
 a threaded connection with play is 
provided between cartridge carrier (4) and housing element (3). 
Explosively actuated setting tool according to Claim 4, 

characterized in that
 the threaded connection is formed by a 
sawtooth thread (3a, 4a), the flatter flanks of which extend 

against the setting direction toward the axis of piston (1). 
Setting tool according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the 
cartridge carrier (4) has in the area of the thread connection 

slots (4f) which are open towards the free end.  
 
Setting tool according to Claim 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the 
measure of limited displaceability as measured along the piston 

axis is between 0.1 mm and 0.3 mm. 
Setting tool according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in 
that
 the mass of the cartridge carrier (4) equals approximately 
between one and three times the mass of the piston (1).
