<ABSTRACT>
In the bag pack disclosed herein, a stack of T-shirt type plastic film bags (11) are held in a paperboard cartridge which is folded to provide front (51) and back panels bridged at the top. The back panel has a cutout tongue (66) which is folded forward under tearaway strips linking the top ends of the bag handle portions. The tongue (66) retains the tearaway strips in the cartridge as individual bags are torn downwardly from the pack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bag pack and more 
particularly to a cartridge for holding a stack of T-shirt 
type plastic film bags suitable for enclosing produce and 
the like. As is understood by household shoppers generally as well 
as by those skilled in the art, produce in supermarkets is 
normally displayed in open bins or chill cases so that each 
shopper can select the individual items according to his or 
her preferences. It is customary to provide a supply of 
bags or sacks for packaging the produce so that it can 
easily be carried to a checkout counter. The most usual 
arrangement for dispensing the bags is to have them wound on 
a roll which is then hung so that individual bags can be 
drawn down and torn from the roll. This is not an entirely 
satisfactory arrangement in most instances since the roll 
will often overrun instead of releasing an individual bag. 
The use of both hands may be required to separate an 
individual bag from the roll. Further, the bags dispensed 
are typically simple tubes open at one end which may require 
a wire tie or the like for satisfactory closing. Similar 
problems exist in bakery and delicatessen contexts. It is known from GB-A-2234734 to band together tearaway 
strips of a stack of bags using a tube, but this produces an 
untidy pack in which loop handles of the bags splay out in 
an uncontrolled fashion.  
 The present invention provides an effective solution to 
these various problems and also yields a bag pack and 
dispenser construction which is advantageously useful in a 
variety of environments including convenience stores and 
supermarkets as well as produce, bakery and delicatessen 
contexts. According to the present invention, a bag pack 
comprises: a stack of T-shirt type plastic film bags (11) 
each having a mouth and loop handles (31, 33) extending 
upwards on either side of the mouth, the handles (31, 33) 
being linked at their upper ends by a tearaway strip (35) 
extending between them, the bag pack being characterised by 
a stiff web member (13,46; 75, 77) which is folded to 
provide front and back parallel panels (51, 52; 81, 82) 
bridged at their upper ends by a top panel (53; 83) thereby 
to form an inverted U-shaped channel which encloses the 
upper ends of the loop handles (31, 33) and the tearaway 
strips (35), either the front or the back panel (51, 52; 81, 
82) having a tongue (61; 85) which is folded under the 
tearaway strips (35) to retain them as individual bags (11) 
are torn downwardly from the pack. The web member is

characterised by a stiff web member (13, 46; 75, 77) which 

is folded to provide front and back parallel panels (51, 52; 
81, 82) bridged at their upper ends by a top panel (53; 83) 

thereby to form an inverted U-shaped channel which encloses

82) having a tongue (61; 85) which is folded under the 

tearaway strips (35) to retain them as individual bags (11) 
are torn downwardly from the pack. 
A bag pack according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the tongue (61; 85), after passing under the tearaway strips 

(35), extends upwardly parallel to the other of the front 
and back panels (51, 52; 81, 82) and terminates in a tab 

(67; 88) extending through a slot (68; 89) in the said other 
panel. 
A bag pack according to claim 1 or claim 2,
 
characterised in that the tearaway strips (35) in the stack 

of bags (11) are bonded to each other, and form an opening 
through the stack. 
A bag pack according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that the mouth portions of the bags are 

contained between the front and back panels (51, 52).  
 
A bag pack according to claim 4, characterised in that 
the web member (13, 46) provides side panels (54 - 57) 

extending between the front and back panels (51, 52). 
A bag dispensing system comprising a bag pack as set 
forth in any preceding claim, characterised in that the 

system further includes a hook member (15; 76) which extends 
under the said tongue (61; 85) and then upwardly for holding 

the web member (13, 46; 75, 77) and the stack of bags (11).
