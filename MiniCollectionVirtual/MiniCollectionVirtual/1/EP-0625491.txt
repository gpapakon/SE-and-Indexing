<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric 
ceramic composition for use in a high frequency and more 
particularly to a dielectric ceramic composition which is 
useful for a material of a dielectric resonator device used 
at a micro wave band, that is, in a micro wave integrated 
circuit. Recently, mobile communication has spread and 
a dielectric resonator device comes to be used as a filter 
of the base station. Such a dielectric resonator device 
receives a high power input and so it is necessary to 
provide a stable dielectric ceramic material resistant to 
the high power input. In order to effectively use a limited frequency 
band, it has been requested to make the frequency band to 
be more narrow. In response to the requirement, it is 
desired to provide a dielectric ceramic material having a 
high Q value at a high frequency band. There has been known, for example, BaO-TiO2 type 
material as a dielectric resonator device for a micro wave 
band, which is generally superior in the dielectric 
characteristic and has a relatively high Q value at a high  
 
frequency band such as micro wave band. However, such a BaO-TiO2 system material 
comprises two crystal phases, BaTi4O9 and Ba2Ti9O20 having 
thermal expansion coefficients 9 ppm/°C and 11 ppm/°C, 
respectively. When the ceramic made of the BaO-TiO2 system 
ceramic having both crystal phases included therein is 
heated, the ceramic generates crack due to a difference of 
2 ppm/°C between both crystal phases in the thermal 
expansion coefficient. Accordingly, it is requested that 
the BaO-TiO2 system ceramic for use at a high power applied 
field must be composed of a single phase of either 
BaTi4O9 or Ba2Ti9O20. Further, as a relevant literature of the BaO-TiO2 
material for use in a high frequency, there is offered a 
paper entitled "The Ternary Systems BaO - TiO2 - SnO2 and 
BaO - TiO2 - ZrO2 " J. Am. Ceram. Soc., Vol. 41, No. 10, 
p.390-394 (1958), in which it is reported that the crystal 
phase of Ba2Ti9O20 can exist stably by substituting Sn or 
Zr for part of Ti. But, there has no description on the 
improvement of the dielectric characteristic. In the Japanese Patent Publication Kokoku sho/56-38007, 
there is disclosed a Ba-Ti-Mn-Zr system material, in 
which it is reported that an addition of both Mn and Zr 
suppresses reduction of a sintered body and prevent the tan  
 
δ from increasing, but the resultant ceramic body has only 
a Q value of 6800 at 6 GHz which is not recognized to be 
sufficiently high. In the Japanese Patent
