,3-DIAZA-HETEROCYCLES AND THEIR USE AS NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHASE INHIBITORSBackground of the inventionField of the Invention10 The present invention relates to 1,3-diazolino and 1,3-diazolidino heterocycle derivatives and their use in therapy, in particular their use as nitric oxide synthase inhibitors .15Related ArtIt has been known since the early 1980 's that the vascular relaxation caused by acetylcholine is dependent on the presence of the vascular endothelium and this20 activity was ascribed to a labile humoral factor termed endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) . The activity of nitric oxide (NO) as a vasodilator has been known for well over 100 years. In addition, NO is the active component of amylnitrite, glyceryltrinitrate and other25 nitrovasodilators . The recent identification of EDRF as NO has coincided with the discovery of a biochemical pathway by which NO is synthesized from the amino acid L- arginine by the enzyme NO synthase.30 Nitric oxide is the endogenous stimulator of the soluble guanylate cyclase. in addition to endothelium- dependent relaxation, NO is involved in a number of biological actions including cytotoxicity of phagocytic cells and cell-to-cell communication in the central35 nervous system (see Moncada et al.. BiochemicalPharmacology, 38, 1709-1715, 1989; Moncada et al.. Pharmacological Reviews, 43, 109-142, 1991). Excess NO 

production appears to be involved in a number of pathological conditions , particularly conditions which involve systemic hypotension such as toxic shock, septic shock and therapy with certain cytokines (Kerwin et al., J. Medicinal Chemistry, 38, 4343-4362, 1995).The synthesis of NO from L-arginine can be inhibited by the L-arginine analogue, L-N-monomethyl-arginine (L- NMMA) and the therapeutic use of L-NMMA for the treatment of toxic shock and other types of systemic hypotension has been proposed (WO 91/04024 and GB-A-2240041) . The therapeutic use of certain other NO synthase inhibitors apart from L-NMMA for the same purpose has also been proposed in WO 91/04024 and in EP-A-0446699.It has recently become apparent that there are at least three types of NO synthase as follows:(i) a constitutive, Ca++/calmodulin dependent enzyme, located in the endothelium, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.(ii) a constitutive, Ca++/calmodulin dependent enzyme, located in the brain, that releases NO in response to receptor or physical stimulation.(iii) a Ca++ independent enzyme which is induced after activation of vascular smooth
