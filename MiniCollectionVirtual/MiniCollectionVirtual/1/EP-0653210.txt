Aqueous, intravenously administerable solution of the 
sulfonamide 3-methoxy-4-(4'-aminobenzenesulfonamido)-1,2,5-thiadiazole 

present as a salt and of 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-pyrimidine, 
characterized in that it 

comprises malic acid, L-serine and/or L-threonine as a 
solubilizer for the 2,4-diamino-5-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-pyrimidine 

together with a strong, 
physiologically tolerable base forming water soluble salts 

with the sulfonamide and the malic acid in an amount equimolar 
to the amount of the sulfonamide present as well as in an 

amount of approximately 2 mol per mol of malic acid present, 
wherein the pH value of the solution is adjusted to the range 

6.4-7.2. 
Solution according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
acids serving as a solubilizer are present in an amount of at 

least 100 milliequivalents per liter solution. 
Solution according to the claims 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the acids serving as a solubilizer are present in an 

amount of 120-180 milliequivalents per liter solution. 
Solution according to the claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the pH value is adjusted to the range of 6.5-7.0. 
Solution according to the claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the solubilizer is malic acid and the strong base is NaOH 

or a mixture of NaOH and KOH, wherein the concentration of KOH 
does not exceed 25 mmol/l of the solution. 
Solution according to the claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the solubilizer is L-serine and/or L-threonine and the 

strong base is NaOH and/or KOH.  
 
Solution according to the claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that it possesses an osmolarity of at least 200 mosmol/l. 
Solution according to the claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the solubilizer is L-malic acid in salt form. 
Solution with anti-bacterial action according to the 
claims 1 to 8, characterized in that it comprises per liter 

11.17 mmol of a Na salt of 3-methoxy-4-(4'-aminobenzenesulfonamido)-1,2,5-thiadiazole, 
2.20 mmol 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-pyrimidine, 

140-180 
milliequivalents L-mali
c acid, L-serine or L-threonine or the 
same equivalent amount of mixtures of the same as well as the 

required amount of NaOH for the adjustment of a pH value of 
6.5 to 7.0, optionally in addition to inert additives for the 

adjustment of the osmolarity to physiologically tolerable 
values. 
Method for the production of the aqueous, intravenously 
administerable solution according to the claims 1 to 9, 

characterized in that malic acid together with approximately 
the two-fold molar amount of a strong, physiologically 

tolerable base, L-serine and/or L-threonine as internal salts 
is added to a solution of the monosalt of 3-methoxy-4-(4'-aminobenzenesulfonamido)-1,2,5-thiadiazole 

with a strong, 
physiologically tolerable base in water under formation of a 

clear, aqueous solution, 2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)-pyrimidine 
is introduced into this solution 

and brought into solution at temperatures from room 
temperature to approximately 90Â°C, whereupon the pH value of 

the resulting solution is adjusted to the desired value in the 
range of 6.4 to 7.2 by addition of the strong base or of malic 

acid and, if necessary, the osmolarity is brought to a 
physiologically acceptable value by addition of inert, low 

molecular substances.
