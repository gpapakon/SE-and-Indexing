<ABSTRACT>
An immunogenic detoxified protein comprising the amino acid sequence of subunit A of cholera toxin (CT-A) or subunit A of an Escherichia coli heat labile toxin (LT-A) or a fragment thereof wherein one or more amino acids at, or in positions corresponding to Val-53, Ser-63, Val-97, Tyr-104 or Pro-106 are replaced with another amino acid or deleted. Examples of specific replacements include Val-53-Asp, Val-53-Glu, Val-53-Tyr, Ser-63-Lys, Val-97-Lys, Val-97-Tyr, Tyr-104-Lys, Tyr-104-Asp, Tyr-104-Ser, Pro-106-Ser. The immunogenic detoxified protein is useful as vaccine for Vibrio cholerae or an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli and is produced by recombinant DNA means by site-directed mutagenesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to immunogenic detoxified
proteins of cholera toxins (CT), or of heat labile toxins
(LT) produced by the enterotoxigenic strains of Escherichia
coli (E.coli) characterized in that the amino acid at pos Ser-63 is replaced. Said immunogenic detoxified protein can additionally have substitutions at one or more of amino
acids Val-53, Val-97, Tyr-104 or Pro-106. The present invention to relates
their use in vaccines which are useful for the prevention or
treatment of cholera or enterotoxigenic E.Coli infections.
The proteins can be suitably produced using recombinant DNA
techniques by site-directed mutagenesis of DNA encoding the
wild type toxins.Cholera is a contagious disease widely distributed in the
world, in particular in the Third World, where, in certain
areas, it is endemic. The serious disorders which develop in
the intestinal system prove fatal in a high percentage of
the recorded cases of the disease.The etiological agent of cholera is the Gram-negative
microorganism Vibrio cholerae (V.cholerae). This colonises
the intestinal tract of individuals who have come into
contact with it through ingestion of contaminated food or
water, and multiplies to very high concentrations. The
principal symptom is severe diarrhoea as a result of which
the patient can lose as much as 10-15 litres of liquids per
day via the faeces. As a result of the severe dehydration
and loss of electrolytes, the patient does not withstand the
infection in 50-60% of cases, and dies. The diarrhoea caused
by V.cholerae is due to the secretion of cholera toxin, CT,
which acts by stimulating the activity of the adenylate
cyclase enzyme so as to induce disturbances at cell level. Although cholera can be effectively cured by controlled and
intense rehydration, the distribution of a vaccine is
desirable with a view to complete control and future
eradication of the disease.At the present time, there exists a vaccination against
cholera, consisting of parenteral administration of killed
bacteria. Although some countries insist on vaccination
against the disease, there are serious doubts as to its real
usefulness, given that the current cellular vaccine protects
against the consequences of the infection in only 50% of the
cases and that the protection is also extremely limited in
duration, to less than 6 months.In Bangladesh, an experimental trial is in progress (1990-92)
of an oral vaccine consisting of killed bacteria with
the addition of subunit B of cholera toxin, which is known
to be highly immunogenic.
