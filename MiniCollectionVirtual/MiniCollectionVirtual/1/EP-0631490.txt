<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (61, 62, 64, 66-617) for measuring the concentration of a selected solute in a solution. This apparatus is particularly suitable for measuring the concentration of blood components, such as blood glucose. A beam of exposing light is imaged through a wall (64) of a containment vessel onto a region of the sample (63) adjacent to this wall to induce from said selected solute emission of light that includes at least one emission peak that can be used to calculate the concentration of this solute. At least one detector (67-610) is positioned to maximize the strength of detected signal, if other components of this solution strongly absorb the emitted light. The exposing light is directed such that the detected signal is maximized as a function of the path of this exposing light. At least two additional detected signals are monitored and processed at wavenumbers suitable for eliminating temperature and pressure effects on the calculated solute levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BLOOD CHEMISTRY MEASUREMENT BY STIMULATED INFRARED EMISSIONTechnical Field This invention relates in general to medical instrumentation, and more particularly to the field of non-invasive blood chemistry measurements, such as measurements of blood glucose concentration levels.Convention Regarding Reference NumeralsIn the figures, the first digit of a reference numeral indicates the first figure in which is presented the element indicated by that reference numeral.Background ArtAn estimated 14 million Americans have diabetes, a disease in which the body does not produce or respond properly to insulin. The resulting high blood glucose concentration levels (also referred to as blood glucose level or blood- sugar levels) can cause severe damage to the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nerves. If untreated, diabetes can lead to death in an unexpectedly short period of time. People with diabetes must balance diet, exercise and medication (e.g., insulin, which can be taken orally or by injections) in order to maintain their blood glucose levels as close as possible to normal levels. Insulin pumps have been developed to enable continuous administration of insulin to a diabetic.Regardless how insulin is administered to a diabetic, it is very important to continually monitor the blood glucose level to avoid the problems that arise from low glucose levels as well as those that arise from excessive glucose levels. Therefore, diabetics have to test their blood glucose levels frequently (as often as six times a day) in order to maintain a proper level of insulin in their blood.Several different techniques have been developed for measuring blood glucose concentration levels. A change in blood glucose level affects the index of refraction and the absorbance spectrum of the blood. For example, in U.S. patent 4,704,029, discussed in more detail below, this change in the index of 

refraction of blood alters the fraction of light reflected at an interface in contact with the blood being tested. This technique is not amenable to a non-invasive method of detecting a person's blood glucose level. Several references, discussed below, utilize absorbance spectroscopy to measure the glucose concentration in a patient's blood. Unfortunately, because of the strong level of absorption of water at the wavelength infrared absorption peaks for blood glucose, these techniques result in small output signals so that there is a smaller than desired signal-to-noise ratio for such tests.Infrared absorption spectroscopy has long been
