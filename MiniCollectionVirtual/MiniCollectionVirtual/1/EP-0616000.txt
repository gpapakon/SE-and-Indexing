<ABSTRACT>
The molecular composite material having excellent 
properties such as mechanical strength, heat resistance, solvent 

resistance, etc. is produced by (a) polymerizing an aromatic 
diaminodithiol compound, of which hydrogen atoms of thiol 

groups of aromatic diaminodithiol compound are substituted with 
substituted or unsubstituted alkyl groups, with a dicarboxylic acid 

derivative to form an aromatic polythiazole prepolymer, (b) 
dissolving the aromatic polythiazole prepolymer in an organic 

solvent to prepare a solution thereof; (c) adding a monomer of the 
matrix polymer to the solution to polymerize the monomer to the 

matrix polymer in the solution; (d) removing the organic solvent 
from a mixture of the aromatic polythiazole prepolymer and the 

matrix polymer; and (e) heating a mixture of the aromatic 
polythiazole prepolymer and the matrix polymer to cause a 

thiazole ring closure reaction of the aromatic polythiazole 
prepolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing
a molecular composite material comprising aromatic polythiazole as
a rigid polymer and a matrix polymer, which molecular composite
material is suitable as a structural material for aircraft,
automobiles, spacecraft, etc.Recently, to achieve the reduction of weight of aircraft,
automobiles, etc., plastic materials called "engineering plastics"
having excellent mechanical properties, heat resistance, etc. have
been increasingly used. Apart from this, development has been
actively carried out to provide composite materials such as FRPs
consisting of plastic materials and high-strength, high-modulus
fibers such as carbon fibers, and these composite materials are
being used in many applications.It is known that the strength of these composite
materials largely depend not only on the strength of plastics and
reinforcing fibers but also on the interfacial bonding strength of the
fibers to the matrix resins. Also, the impregnating capability of
matrix resins into the fiber-reinforced preforms affect the easiness
of production of composite materials and the strength of the
resulting products. Accordingly, even though high-strength, high-modulus
fibers and resins are used as starting materials, composite
materials having excellent strength are not necessarily obtained. Under such circumstances, to overcome the above
problems, proposals have been made to develop high-strength
polymer blend composites (molecular composite materials) by
finely dispersing rigid polymers such as aromatic polyamides, etc.
in matrix resins to a molecular level.Aromatic polymers suitable for molecular composite
materials include those containing heterocyclic repeating units such
as thiazole rings, imidazole rings, oxazole rings, oxazinone rings, etc.
Among them, aromatic polythiazole having a thiazole ring is highly
promising because of its excellent mechanical strength.In the meantime, the homogeneous dispersion of a
reinforcing polymer in a matrix polymer cannot be achieved if the
reinforcing polymer is simply blended with the matrix polymer.
This means that simple blending fails to provide a molecular
composite material having excellent mechanical properties.
Therefore, various attempts have been made so far.For instance, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 1-287167
discloses a method of producing a polymer composite comprising
the steps of introducing a polymer solution mainly containing (A) a
reinforcing polymer consisting of polythiazole having a
substantially rod-shaped skeleton and
