<DESCRIPTION>
 CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITE MATERIALThis invention relates to carbon-carbon composites, especially to a method for the manufacture of such composites and to products of the method.It is known to produce carbon-carbon composites by providing a composition of carbon fibres and carbonisable carbonaceous material and then carbonising the material, or by depositing carbon from a gaseous phase onto a carbon fibre substrate. One known method comprises applying a molten pitch to a preform of carbon fibres, often at a high pressure, and then carbonising the pitch.Usually the current methods for manufacturing carbon-carbon composites are slow and costly and have other shortcomings, especially in the manufacture of products such as aircraft brake discs.An object of the present invention is the provision of an efficient economic method for the manufacture of carbon-carbon composites having a uniform high density, and graphitised versions of such composites suitable for applications requiring high thermal conductivity, for instance in aircraft brakes.The present invention provides a method for the manufacture of a carbon-carbon composite by providing an assembly of carbon fibre and carbonisable carbonaceous material, subjecting the assembly to heat and pressure to consolidate the assembly and heating to carbonise the carbonaceous material: wherein the assembly of carbon fibre and carbonisable carbonaceous material is provided by a process comprising wetting carbon fibre with a liquid medium carrying carbonisable carbonaceous material and then removing the liquid medium to deposit a coating of the carbonaceous material on the carbon fibre.According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a moulding compound comprising an assembly of carbon fibre having a coating of carbonisable carbonaceous material deposited from a 

solution and/or suspension of the material in a liquid medium. The assembly may be at least partially consolidated.The present invention also provides products of the aforementioned method.The carbon fibre may be of any kind normally employed for the manufacture of carbon-carbon composites. Staple and/or continuous length fibre may be employed. Preferably the carbon fibre consists of or comprises fibres having a length of at least 10 mm, especially at least 25 mm. Examples of the form of the carbon fibre are continuous tow, non-woven fabric (needled or non-needled), woven fabric and knitted fabric.The carbonisable carbonaceous material typically is a polymeric material, preferably a
