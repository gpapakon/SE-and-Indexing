<DESCRIPTION>
 SUPERANTIGENSTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to superantigens, and to their use, including in diagnosis and/ or treatment of disease.BACKGROUND ARTBacterial superantigens are the most potent T cell mitogens known. They stimulate large numbers of T cells by directly binding to the side of the MHC class II and T cell Receptor (TcR) molecules. Because they override the normally exquisite MHC restriction phenomenon of T cell antigen recognition, they are prime candidates for either causing the onset of autoimmune diseases or exacerbating an existing autoimmune disorder.The applicants have identified genes coding for four novel superantigens from S. pyogenes. It is broadly to these superantigens and polynucleotides encoding them that the present invention is directed.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIn one aspect the invention provides a superantigen selected from any one of SMEZ- 2, SPE-G, SPE-H and SPE-J, or a functionally equivalent variant thereof.In a further aspect the invention provides a polynucleotide molecule comprising a sequence encoding a superantigen chosen from SMEZ-2, SPE-G, SPE-H, SPE-J, or a functionally equivalent variant thereof.In another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of subtyping Streptococci on the basis of superantigen genotype comprising detection of the presence of any or all of the above four superantigens or the corresponding polynucleotides. 

In a further aspect the invention provides a construct comprising any of the above superantigens (or superantigen variants) bound to a cell-targeting molecule, which is preferably a tumour-specific antibody.In yet a further aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for therapy or prophylaxis comprising a superantigen or superantigen variant as described above linked to cell targeting molecule.Other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the description provided below, and from the appended claims.DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGSWhile the invention is broadly defined above, it further includes embodiments of which the following description provides examples. It will also be better understood with reference to the following drawings:Fig 1 : Multiple alignment of superantigen protein sequences.The protein sequence of mature toxins were aligned using the PileUp programme on the GCG package. Regions of high sequence identity are in black boxes. The boxes below the sequences indicate the structural elements of SPE-C, as determined from the crystal structure (Roussel et al 1997 Nat. Struct. Biol. 4 no8:635-43).
