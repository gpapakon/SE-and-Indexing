<ABSTRACT>
Linking device between two structures (1, 7) which are subjected to relative displacements limited in translation along three axes which are orthogonal two by two (X, Y, Z), as well as relative rotation displacements about said axes. The device comprises cylindrical articulations (A) arranged on a circumference (C) centered on one (Z) of said axes and parallel to the plane (P) defined by the other two axes (X, Y), said articulations (A) being each comprised of at least two rigid cylindrical and coaxial tubes (11, 12) between which adheres a sleeve (14) made of elastic material. The axis a of said articulations is parallel to the above mentionned plane (P) and tangent to said circumference (C).
