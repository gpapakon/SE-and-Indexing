<ABSTRACT>
With a simple circuit, it is possible to shift the image position freely without degradation of the image quality. The apparatus 
comprises a synchronizing signal separation circuit (3) for separating the horizontal synchronizing signal and the vertical synchronizing 

signal from an image signal; a variable delay circuit (11) for generating horizontal synchronizing signal which is delayed 
in synchronism with the horizontal synchronizing signal; a horizontal scanning pulse output circuit (13) for setting the 

horizontal scanning period during which the image signal is scanned after the delay; a variable delay circuit (4) for generating 
vertical synchronizing signal which is delayed in synchronism with the vertical synchronizing signal which is separated by the 

synchronizing signal separation circuit; a vertical scanning pulse output circuit (6) for setting the vertical scanning period during 
which the horizontal scanning lines are scanned after the delay; a horizontal deflection circuit (14) for outputting the horizontal 

sawtooth waveforms; and a vertical deflection circuit (7) for outputting the vertical sawtooth waveforms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a television monitoring system, 
and particularly to a television monitor device such as a 
television intercom system which has a simple structure, suffers 
no deterioration in image quality and can freely move an image 
position of a visitor. A television intercom system is known from the prior art 
which is equipped with a door station or sub-station having a 
camera for receiving an image of a visitor and generate a image 
signal, and an in-house station or master station for receiving 
the image signals generated by the sub-station, wherein the image 
signal transmitted from the sub-station is monitored by a 
television monitor installed in the master station. Among such television intercom systems, a mechanical system 
was proposed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 4-53382. 
In this mechanical system, the camera of the sub-station 
is provided with a pan and tilt function, and a pan and tilt 
control signal is transmitted from the master station to the sub-station 
to control a tilt-up and tilt-down motor and a pan-leftward 
and pan-rightward motor, thereby preventing the picture 
of the visitor from disappearing from the screen of the 
television monitor. In this television intercom system, the  
 
camera is driven by the tilt-up and tilt-down motor and the pan-leftward 
and pan-rightward motor, for which purpose mechanical 
parts are used. Therefore, there are problems such as the 
adverse effect on its effective life due to friction etc. of 
mechanical parts, increase in the number of parts, and delay of 
the pan and tilt operation. Further, there is also a problem in 
that complicated control circuitry for the pan and tilt control 
signal transmitted from the master station to the sub-station 
must be provided in the master station and sub-station. On the other hand, a television intercom system as disclosed 
in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. 2-114786 has been 
proposed as a digital system. In this digital system, an image 
memory is provided, and the image memory is subjected to various 
kinds of digital video techniques to enlarge an image at the 
lower edge of the screen. This television intercom system has 
functions different from the pan and tilt function, and fulfills 
a great many functions. Further, it has an advantage in that 
complicated control circuitry for the pan and tilt control signal 
is not required in the master station and the sub-station, and 
the number of mechanical parts can be reduced. Indeed, on the 
contrary, image
