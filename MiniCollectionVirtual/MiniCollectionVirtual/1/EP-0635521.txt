<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of polypropylene comprising 
continuously contacting liquid propylene or a mixture comprising 

liquid propylene and one or more other alpha-olefins in one or 
more reaction zones, under gas phase polymerization conditions, 

with a catalyst system comprising (i) a solid particulate catalyst 
precursor, which includes magnesium; titanium; a halogen 

which is chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or mixtures thereof; and, as 
an inside electron donor, a carboxylic acid ester; (ii) a 

hydrocarbylaluminum cocatalyst; and (iii) as an outside electron 
donor, a silicon compound containing at least one silicon-oxygencarbon 

linkage, the particles of precursor being carried into the 
reaction zone(s) via a portion of the liquid propylene, the flow rate 

of said portion having a Reynolds number greater than about 
15,000.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of
polypropylene having a commercially desirable resin morphology.In United States Patent 5,093,415, a process is provided
for producing stereoregular polymers. More particularly, it was
found that polymers having an isotactic index of at least 96 percent
could be prepared in high yield at high production rates by
polymerizing an alpha-olefin in a low pressure gas phase fluidized
bed process at temperatures in excess of 50°C employing a catalyst
system comprising (i) a solid catalyst precursor, which includes
magnesium, titanium, halogen, and an inside electron donor, i.e.,
a polycarboxylic acid ester containing two coplanar ester groups
attached to adjacent carbon atoms; (ii) a hydrocarbylaluminum
cocatalyst; and (iii) an outside electron donor or selectivity control
agent, i.e., a silicon compound containing a silicon-oxygen-carbon
linkage wherein the atomic ratio of aluminum to silicon is in the
range of about 0.5:1 to about 100:1 and the atomic ratio of
aluminum to titanium is in the range of about 5:1 to about 300:1.This catalyst system can be used to provide
homopolymers of propylene and copolymers of propylene and one
or more alpha-olefins. The high activity at temperatures in the
range of about 50°C to about 110°C makes this catalyst system very
attractive; however, it is also desired to control average particle
size within prescribed limits while maintaining high bulk density.
Homopolymers can generate excessive fines raising the concern of
a possible dust explosion. Random copolymers can become too
large presenting the problems of poor flowability and low bulk 
density. Fines, flowability, and bulk density are dependent on
average particle size, which is in turn dependent on resin
morphology.An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a
process for the production of polypropylene having improved resin
morphology.Accordingly, the present invention provides a
process for the production of polypropylene comprising
continuously contacting liquid propylene or a mixture
comprising liquid propylene and one or more other
alpha-olefins in one or more reaction zones, under gas
phase polymerization conditions, with a catalyst
system comprising (i) a solid particular catalyst
precursor, which includes magnesium; titanium; a
halogen which is chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or
mixtures thereof; and, as an inside electron donor, a
carboxylic acid ester; (ii) a hydrocarbylaluminum
cocatalyst; and (iii) as an outside electron donor, a
silicon
