<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of dialkyl 
peroxides such as ditertiary butyl peroxide by the reaction of an 
alcohol such as tertiary butyl alcohol and/or an olefin such as 
isobutylene with a hydroperoxide such as tertiary butyl 
hydroperoxide in the presence of an acidic resin catalyst. The preparation of dialkyl peroxides by the reaction of an 
alcohol such as tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) with an organic 
hydroperoxide such as tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) is known. 
See, for example, U.S. Patents 2,403,771, 2,403,758, 2,862,973, 
3,626,014 and the like. The preparation of dialkyl peroxides by 
the reaction of an olefin such as 2-methylbut-2-ene with an organic 
hydroperoxide such as TBHP is also known. See Davies, et al., J. 
Chem. Sec. page 2200, 1954. Also French patent 1,555,308 shows the 
reaction of isobutylene with hydrogen peroxide to produce TBHP and 
ditertiary butyl peroxide. In such prior processes, catalysts such as sulfuric acid, 
sulfonic acid resins having a low degree of cross-linking and the 
like have been employed. The use of such catalysts has a number of 
disadvantages including the corrosion and safety hazards associated 
with the use of sulfuric acid, catalyst deactivation and 
deterioration associated with the use of catalyst resins and the  
 
like. Canadian Patent 839,312, for example, shows the production 
of ditertiary butyl peroxide by the reaction of TBA with TBHP using 
a gel-type 4% cross-linked sulfonic acid resin with the requirement 
that water be azeotropically removed as with chloroform in order 
for the reaction to proceed. The preparation of organic hydroperoxides by reaction of an 
alcohol such as TBA with hydrogen peroxide using an inorganic 
heteropoly acid is shown in U.S. Patent 2,630,456. In accordance with the present invention, a process is 
provided for the production of dialkyl peroxides wherein an alcohol 
and/or an olefin is reacted with an organic hydroperoxide in the 
presence of an acidic resin catalyst. When the catalyst has only a low degree of cross-linking, the 
hydroperoxide is reacted primarily with olefin in order to avoid 
the deleterious effect of water which is illustrated in Canadian 
Patent 839,312. In especially preferred practice where the 
catalyst is at least 10% cross-linked, preferably at least 20% 
cross-linked, the hydroperoxide can be reacted with alcohol or with 
olefin, or with mixtures. The process of the present invention can be represented by the 
following equations:
