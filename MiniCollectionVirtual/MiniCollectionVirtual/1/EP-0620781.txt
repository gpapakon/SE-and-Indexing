<ABSTRACT>
The heat-protection element proposed consists of support elements in the form of glass plates, for instance. Between pairs of glass plates is a cavity in which is located a protective layer of cured polysilicate produced from an alkali-metal silicate and at least one curing agent, the molar ratio of silicon dioxide to alkali-metal oxide in the polysilicate being greater than 4:1. The starting compound used for the production of the polysilicate is a free-flowing material with a water content of up to 60 % and can be poured into the cavity between two support elements. When the compound hardens, the water content remains high. The polysilicate produced nevertheless has a high inherent strength and adheres well to the support elements.
