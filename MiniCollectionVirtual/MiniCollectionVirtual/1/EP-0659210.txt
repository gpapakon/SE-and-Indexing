<ABSTRACT>
It has been found that various strains of the genus (Thermoactinomyces) produce substantial quantities of chitosanase when cultivated under appropriate conditions and that a new strain of (Thermoactinomyces) with the identification I-1052, Institut Pasteur, Paris, is of special interest. A new thermostable enzyme has been isolated from the culture broth of this new strain. This new enzyme hydrolyzes chitosans with varying acetylation degrees. New depolymerized partially acetylated chitosan products are obtained by the use of these new enzymes and are characterized by their viscosity, molecular weight distribution and degree of acetylation. Such new products can be used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetic compositions and as auxiliaries in paper making.

<DESCRIPTION>
NE PRODUCTS OF DEPOLYMERIZING PARTIALLY ACETYLATED CHITOSAN, NEW ENZYMES AND NEW THERMOACTINOMYCES STRAIN FOR THEPRODUCTION THEREOF.The invention relates to a process for the production of depolymerized partially acetylated chitosan and to the new products obtained by this process, to the use of microorganisms of the genus Thermoactinomyces in a process for the production of an enzyme which depolymerizes partially acetylated chitosan and to a new strain of Thermoactinomyces .Chitosan is the product of partial or complete deacetylation of chitin. Both chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) and chitosanase act on partially acetylated chitosan. Such depolymerisation has been described with an enzyme of microbial origin, especially of the genus Bacillus and it has been tried to digest chitosan with chitinase produced by Streptomyces antibioticus. All these processes have not allowed commercial production of chitosan hydrolysates by enzymatic hydrolysis of industrial chitosans. Such products are of interest in various fields, especially in the fields which require the use of concentrated chitosan solutions of low viscosity and/or the use of well characterized chitosan fractions (acetylation degree, molecular weight distribution, viscosity).It has been found that various strains of the genus Thermoactinomyces produce substantial quantities of an enzyme which depolymerizes partially acetylated chitosan when cultivated under appropriate conditions and that a new strain of Thermoactinomyce s is of special interest in this respect. This enzyme has some activity on colloidal chitin (i.e. 100% acetylated chitosan) and, therefore, acts as as chitinase. The right substrate, however, is a partially acetylated chitosan having an acetylation degree between 10% and 70% (which is the case with most industrial grades of chitosan). In the context of this specification the enzyme which depolymerizes partially acetylated chitosan will be called chitosanase.The invention, therefore, relates to a process for the production of such chitosanase which is 

characterized by the cultivation of Thermoactinomyces sp„ to a process for the production of such chitosan hydrolysates which is characterized by the use of such chitosanase and to the new strain of Thermoactinomyces which is identified by its deposition no. 1-1052 at the Institut Pasteur, Paris. The invention further relates to the new products obtained by this process and which are characterized by their viscosity, molecular weight distribution and degree of acetylation. In general, the
