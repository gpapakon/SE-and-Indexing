<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat recoverable fabric sleeve for 
enclosing an elongate object such as a pipe or cable, or a joint between 
pipes or cables. In particular the invention relates to such a sleeve for 
covering an object which varies in cross-sectional area along its length. Heat recoverable articles are well known. They are articles whose 
dimensional configuration may be made to change when subjected to an 
appropriate treatment. Typically heat recoverable articles comprise a heat 
shrinkable sleeve made from a polymeric material that exhibits the 
property of elastic or plastic memory as described, for sample in US 
patents 2027962, 3086242 and 3597372. More recently heat recoverable 
articles comprising fabrics have become known, as described for example 
in EP-A-0116393 (MP0790), EP-A-0117026 (RK176), EP-B-0115905 (RK177) 
and EP-A-0116392 (RK178). These comprise a recoverable fabric in 
conjunction with a polymeric matrix formed by laminating a polymeric 
material to one or both sides of the fabric to render it impervious. Recoverable fabrics have found many applications. EP-A-0115905 
describes a polymeric-laminated, heat recoverable fabric having a recovery 
ratio of at least 40%, preferably at least 50 or 60% that may be used for 
example to cover substrates with varying or discontinuous contours to 
provide mechanical protection or protection from the environment. The 
entire disclosure of EP-B-0115905 is incorporated herein by reference. Within the scope of the invention described in EP-B-0115905 we 
have discovered a specific heat recoverable fabric configuration that 
provides a high recovery ratio and particularly advantageous properties.  
 WO91/04844 discloses a heat recoverable sleeve containing a heat recoverable fabric. 
The fabric may be a twill. However the maximum recovery ratio disclosed is 40%, and the 
preferred maximum is 30%. There is no disclosure of the use of a broken twill 2/4 weave. According to the present invention a heat recoverable sleeve comprising (a) a woven 
fabric having a twill weave and having heat recoverable fibres extending in a first direction 
and heat stable fabrics and heat recoverable fibres extending in the other weave direction, and 
(b) polymeric material laminated to at least one side of the fabric characterized in that the 
recovery ratio is at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, there are at least 10 to 20 heat 
recoverable fibres per cm extending in said first direction, 1 to 10 heat stable fibres per cm in 
the other weave direction
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A heat recoverable sleeve (10) comprising: 

(a) a woven fabric having a twill weave and having heat recoverable fibres (2) 
extending in a first direction and heat stable fibres (1) and heat recoverable fibres (2) 

extending in the other weave direction, and 
(b) polymeric material laminated to at least one side of the fabric characterized in 
that the recovery ratio is at least 60%, preferably at least 70%, there are 10 to 20 heat 

recoverable fibres per cm extending in said first direction, 1 to 10 heat stable fibres per 
cm in the other weave direction, and 1 to 4 heat recoverable fibres per cm in the said 

other weave direction, and wherein the fabric configuration is broken twill 2/4. 
A heat recoverable sleeve according to Claim 1, wherein the sleeve is a wraparound 
sleeve. 
A heat recoverable sleeve according to Claim 2, wherein at least one longitudinal edge 
of the sleeve is penetrated by a mechanical joining arrangement, preferably stitching, 

stapling or riveting, which joins that edge (i) to the other longitudinal edge or (ii) to a 
patch (12), in order to close the sleeve. 
A heat recoverable sleeve according to any preceding claim, wherein the unresolved 
recovery stress of the fabric at 10% unresolved recovery is in the range 13N/50mm 

(0.185 MPa) to 21N/50mm (0.3 MPa). 
A heat recoverable sleeve according to any preceding claim, wherein the unresolved 
recovery stress of the fabric at 30% unresolved recovery is at least 1N/50mm, (0.0142 

MPa). 
A heat recoverable sleeve according to any preceding claim, wherein the heat 
recoverable fibres comprise polyethylene.  

 
A heat recoverable sleeve according to any preceding claim wherein the heat stable 
fibres (1) are glass.
