<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a fishtail die, of improved design compared with prior art dies, for an extrusion machine for the production of sheets. The die has an extremely tight sequence of adjusting elements (13) by means of which at least one nozzle lip (3, 5) can be adjusted over a limited bend line to limit the die orifice (1).
