<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of
microbicides. In particular, it relates to a stable microbicide
having anticorrosive properties comprising a mixture of hydrogen
peroxide, peracetic acid, acetic acid and purified water which
is substantially free of contaminants or stabilizing and
sequestrant type additives.Peracetic acid/peroxide containing compositions have a
long history of use as disinfectants and sterilizers due to
their microbicidal activities. However, peroxide containing
compositions are high-energy-state compounds and as such can be
considered.thermodynamically unstable. Therefore, because there
is a strong tendency for these compositions to decompose in the
presence of multivalent metal ions, stabilizers are added.
Stabilizers may be agents such as sodium pyrophosphate,
phosphonic acid or chelating agents such as 8-hydroxyquinoline.
Stabilizers act by removing trace metals which accelerate the
decomposition of peroxides. Stabilizers also accelerate the
reaction between hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid to form
peracetic acid. Therefore, for any given concentration of
hydrogen proxide and acetic acid, the addition of a stabilizer
increases the concentration at equilibrium of peracetic acid. WO91/15122 discloses a stable, shippable microbicide solution having improved anti-corrosive
properties including 0.004 - 30% hydrogen peroxide, 0.003-55% peracetic acid, 0.025-12% acetic
acid, water and from 0.001% to the solubility limit of an anticorrosive additive. In WO91/15122 it is
an added wetting agent, preferably Victawet ® 35B, which imports improved anticorrosiveness to the
composition. This additive is the sodium hydroxide reaction product of an aliphatic alcohol and
phosphorous peutoxide.EP 0147207 discloses that the stability of disinfectant concentrates comprising peracetic or
perpropionic acid, hydrogen peroxide, acetic or propionic acid, water and wetting agent is improved
when an alkyl aryl sulphonic acid is employed as the wetting agent. The wetting agent is added to
the disinfectant concentrate.EP 0370850 discloses a concentrate of hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, acetic acid and water. In
use the concentrate should be used in a dilution of between 1/10 and 1/35. The concentrate is said to be
stable and antiallergic. Stabilizer is not referred to.Chemical Abstracts, Vol 104, nr 19, 1986, abstract 167038w, discloses that an aqueous
sanitizer solution containing H202 550-1100, peracetic acid 100-200, acetic acid 150-300, and
1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1diphosphonic acid
