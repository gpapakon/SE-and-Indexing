<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a light-sensitive silver
halide photographic emulsion, and more particularly to a
light-sensitive silver halide photographic emulsion having
a high sensitivity and promising a high stability in its
production process.In the production process of light-sensitive silver
halide photographic materials (hereinafter also "light-sensitive
material"), silver halide photographic emulsions
having been subjected to chemical ripening are often
stored for a certain time in a given environment before
they are coated. On that occasion, ripening may proceed
because of the presence of a spectral sensitizing dye
having not reacted with silver halide grains and remaining 
in a very small quantity, sometimes resulting in an
increase in fog of emulsions after they have been coated
and dried or a change in sensitivity when the spectral
sensitizing dye adsorbed on silver halide grains become
released therefrom during storage.In recent years, there is also an increasing demand
for making light-sensitive materials higher in
sensitivity, and means for improving both light absorption
characteristics and developability of silver halide have
been hitherto taken as means for achieving high
sensitivity. For example, for the purpose of improving
spectral sensitivity, Japanese Patent Publications Open to
Public Inspection [hereinafter referred to as Japanese
Patent O.P.I. Publication(s)] No. 51627/1963 and No.
77443/1984 disclose a method in which a water-soluble
iodide is added to a silver iodobromide emulsion.This method can be effective for increasing
adsorbability of spectral sensitizing dyes on the surfaces
of silver halide grains to adjust spectral sensitivity
distribution or decrease the release of spectral
sensitizing dyes in an environment of high humidity and
high temperature, but has a disadvantage of causing a
lowering of sensitivity when the water-soluble iodide is
added to such an extent that the adsorbability of spectral
sensitizing dyes is well increased. In addition, in this 
method, the resulting emulsions often undergo changes in
sensitivity with time probably because the reaction of
adsorption of iodide ions on the surfaces of silver halide
grains is so rapid that the adsorption reaction is non-uniform
and unstable.Meanwhile, as a means for increasing sensitivity of
silver chlorobromide emulsions and improving their aging
stability, a method in which a water-soluble bromide or a
water-soluble iodide is added is known in the art
(Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publications No. 96331/982 and No.
