<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a novel method of 
preparing a yellow mosaic disease-resistant barley without requiring 

long-term breeding or having significant adverse effects on 
essential characters of barley due to introduction of a 

resistance to yellow mosaic disease-causing viruses, that is, a 
barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) and a barley mild mosaic 

virus (BaMMV). The method of the invention includes the 
steps of: (a) isolating a gene including a specific gene region 

coding a capsid protein, as a capsid protein gene, from 
cDNA of a barley yellow mosaic virus genome or a barley mild 

mosaic virus genome; (b) conjugating the capsid protein gene 
with a plasmid vector or rearranging the capsid protein gene 

and then conjugating the rearranged gene with a plasmid 
vector, in order to construct a vector DNA having 

an ability to transform barley cells; (c) transforming 
the barley cells with the vector DNA; and (d) making the 

transformed barley cells regenerated in a barley plant, 
so as to make the capsid protein originated from the capsid 

protein gene expressed in the barley plant to prepare 
the yellow mosaic disease-resistant barley. The method of 

the invention is applicable to different strains of both the 
BaYMV and BaMMV.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing 
a yellow mosaic disease-resistant barley, and more specifically to 
the preparation of a yellow mosaic disease-resistant barley by 
isolating a specific gene region coding a capsid protein of 
a barley yellow mosaic virus (hereinafter referred to as BaYMV) 
or a barley mild mosaic virus (hereinafter referred to as BaMMV), 
recombining the gene region as a capsid protein gene, and 
making the recombined gene to be expressed in barley plants. Development of a new cultivar of barley with sufficient 
resistance to the barley yellow mosaic virus is of great importance 
especially in Japan, China, Europe, and other yellow mosaic 
disease-tainted regions. The yellow mosaic disease-resistant barley 
has conventionally been bred by introducing a specific resistant 
gene of a barley species having a resistance to BaYMV through 
a long-term mating process. There are three different generally-known strains of BaYMV, that is, 
types I, II, and III. Giving a barley breed sufficient resistance to 
all three strains of BaYMV has not yet been successfully achieved. 
It is quite difficult to introduce a plurality of resistant genes 
by a conventional mating technique without having significant 
adverse effects on essential characters of barley. Recent study on 
the BaMMV has also revealed the spread of BaMMV-caused yellow mosaic.  One object of the present invention is thus to provide a novel 
method of preparing a yellow mosaic disease-resistant barley. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for 
the preparation of a yellow mosaic disease-resistant barley without 
requiring long-term breeding or having significant adverse effects 
on essential characteristics of barley due to the introduction of 
resistance to yellow mosaic disease-causing viruses. As described previously, two different viruses BaYMV and BaMMV, 
each having a plurality of strains, cause yellow mosaic disease 
in barley. The inventors have clarified gene structures of two different 
yellow mosaic disease-causing viruses, BaYMV and BaMMV, through a 
long-term study of the molecular biology of yellow mosaic disease 
in barley, and specified gene regions coding capsid proteins 
particularly concerned with the invention. These results are 
presented in Kashiwazaki et al., Journal of General Virology, 70, 
3015-3023(1989), Kashiwazaki et al., Journal of General Virology, 
73, 2173-2181(1992), and Japanese Patent Kokai Hei 4-180624. 
Based on these results, the inventors have completed a
