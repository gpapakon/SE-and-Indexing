<ABSTRACT>
A digital-to-analog (D/A) convertor (206) multiplies an input signal by a sinewave approximation (300) to perform frequency translation. Optimized coefficient values are predetermined and are programmed based on a control word generated during a clock cycle. The programming over a time period representative of the frequency of the sinewave approximation (300) provides a signal that multiplies an input signal such that the effects of odd harmonics at an output are mitigated while the advantages of a traditional switching mixer are retained. In one embodiment the multiplying D/A convertor (206) includes a plurality of resistors (R1-R8) connected to an amplifier (400), with plural switching gates (G1-G8) switching select resistors (R1-R8) in and out of operation, a control word from counter/controller (203) controlling the gates (G1-G8).

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR FREQUENCY TRANSLATION IN A COMMUNICATION DEVICEField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to communication devices and more specifically to frequency translation in communication devices.Background of the InventionIn a Direct Conversion Receiver it is often necessary to upconvert the baseband signal to an IF frequency for demodulation. One of the most popular types of mixers that is used in the frequency range of 0-5 MHz is a switching mixer which uses CMOS transmission gates to alternately change the gain applied to the baseband signal between the values of +1 and -1. The gain is switched at a frequency of a local oscillator, Flo*Switching mixers have advantages such as simplicity, low offset voltage, large dynamic range, and easy to generate quadrature switching signals using D flip-flops. However, switching mixers have one major disadvantage in that the baseband signal will be replicated at each odd harmonic of the clock signal, due to the fact that the multiplying signal is a square wave. Since the harmonic rolloff rate of a square wave is 1/n, where n is the harmonic of Flo, an undesired signal centered at 3Flo will be present with a level that is approximately only 9.5 dB down from the desired signal centered at Flo* As the bandwidth of the baseband signal approaches Flo, a bandpass filter with very steep skirt selectivity is required in order to remove the undesired harmonic signals at 3Fio and higher. 

 Since the baseband signal is multiplied by the Fourier Transform of the multiplying waveform, one obvious solution to reduce the odd harmonics which appear at the output of the mixer is to use a sinewave as the multiplying signal. There are several circuit approaches which exploit the nonlinearity of transistors to accomplish this technique, however, they do not have the advantages of the switching mixer which were mentioned above. Thus a need exists for a mixer having the advantages of the switching mixer described above without the having the disadvantage of the odd harmonics at its output.Brief Description of the DrawingsFIG. 1 generally depicts in block diagram form a prior art switching mixer.FIG. 2 generally depicts in block diagram form a switching mixer in accordance with the invention.FIG. 3 generally depicts a square wave and a sinewave approximation in accordance with the invention.FIG. 4 generally depicts an embodiment of a multiplying D/A convertor in accordance with the invention.Detailed Description of a Preferred EmbodimentThe proposed
