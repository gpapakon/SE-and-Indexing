<ABSTRACT>
Known is a logarithmic level detector comprising a cascade of a plurality of amplifier stages having a rectifier. Outputs signals of the amplifiers stages are summed so as to form an output signal of the level detector. Such a level detector is sensitive to temperature and manufacturing spread when embodied as an integrated circuit. A logarithmic level detector is proposed that provides a very accurate level detector output signal that is greatly insensitive to temperature and process spread. The logarithmic level detector comprises a weighted summed reference circuit which is subtracted from a level output signal of the cascade of limiting amplifiers so as to form a relative level detector output signal, and further compensation circuitry at input and output side, and an overall gain stabilizing circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
"A logarithmic level detector and a radio receiver"The present invention relates to a logarithmic level detector comprising a cascade of a plurality of limiting amplifier stages having a rectifier for providing a level signal, which detector further comprises summing means so as to form a summed signal from the respective level signals, the summed signal being a logarithmical amplified version of a level detector input signal.The present invention further relates to a radio receiver comprising such a logarithmic level detector. Such a radio receiver can be a broadcast receiver, a cordless telephony receiver, a paging receiver, a cellular radio receiver, or any other suitable receiver in which a logarithmic level detector can be used.A logarithmic level detector of the above kind is known from the US Patent No. 5,338,985. For achieving a very high gain factor, e.g. 80 dB, such a logarithmic level detector comprises many cascaded amplifier stages. Because of multiplicative gain error propagation, the overall gain factor is very sensitive to relatively small gain variations per stage. Such a level detector can be used in a car radio or in a cellular radio, or the like. In a car radio, for instance, the level detector determines the received signal strength from an intermediate frequency signal. A level detector output signal is then used for various purposes, such as for controlling switching over the radio from a stereophonic reception mode to a monophonic reception mode, for controlling multipath reception of signals, for switching over of radio channels in case the radio implements RDS (Radio-Data System), and so on. Because of the use of the level detector output signal for various purposes at different level detector output signal levels it is important that at least for one purpose, the level detector output signal value is very accurate and stable over a wide temperature range. When for example the level detector output signal would be used for stereophonic/monophonic mode switching it would be very annoying if the level detector output signal would vary widely with temperature variations. Such a widely varying level detector output value with temperature would either cause an early switching from a stereophonic to a monophonic receiving mode experienced by a listener hearing a dull sound, or even worse, would cause a 

late switching from a stereophonic to a monophonic receiving mode experienced by a listener hearing aggressive noise. In particular in radio receivers having digital signal
