<CLAIMS>
Non-woven fabric made up of filaments formed from a polymeric material,

characterised in that all of the filaments which comprise it are formed entirely from a
polymer, or from a mixture of polymers, derived from lactic acid.
Non-woven fabric according to claim 1, characterised in that said polymer or said
polymers making up said filaments is (are) derived from L or D lactic acid.
Non-woven fabric according to claim 1, characterised in that said polymer or said
polymers making up said filaments are obtained from a mixture of L and D lactic acids.
Non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that said
polymer or said mixture of polymers derived from lactic acid has a molecular mass of

between 100 000 g/mol and 200 000 g/mol and a polydispersity index of between about 1
and about 3.
Non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that said
polymer or said polymers has or have a vitreous transition temperature of between 45°C

and 55o C and a fusion temperature of between 165° C and 180° C.
Non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the titer of
the filaments making up said non-woven fabric is between 0.5 and 10 dtex, advantageously

between 1 and 5 dtex and preferably between 2.5 and 4,5 dtex.
Non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that it
comprises different geometrical seams between filaments over about 5% to 50% of its

surface, obtained by hot calendering.
Non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
filaments have hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties, obtained by impregnation or

pulverisation of surfactants.
Method of manufacturing a non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that it essentially comprises introducing a solid mass of polymers or of a

mixture of polymers, derived from lactic acid, into a heated extruder (2), heating said mass
in a controlled manner while working it, in order to obtain a molten mass which is

homogeneous and has a specific viscosity, subsequently transporting said molten mass to a
die (3, 3') for forming filaments, cooling and extracting the filaments thus obtained, laying

said filaments, without preferential orientation, on a circulatory collecting belt (4), so as to
form a non-woven cloth or sheet and, finally, if necessary, interlocking said filaments of

said cloth at the level of at least a portion of their mutually intersecting points and/or
treating said filaments of said cloth by immersion, coating, impregnation or pulverisation. 
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that it comprises pushing the molten
material produced from the extruder (2) through a die (3) composed of a plurality of

sections, advantageously seven, then cooling the filaments produced from each section by
a flow of air (8), subsequently extracting said filaments, by Venturi effect, into nozzles (9)

and, finally, laying the extracted filaments on a circulatory collecting belt (4), without
preferential orientation and in a homogeneous manner, through the intermediary of

separators (10).
Method according to claim 10, characterised in that it comprises maintaining the
extruder (2) at a temperature of between 185° C and 205° C.
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that it comprises pushing the molten
material produced from the extruder (2) through a one-piece die (3'), then cooling the

filaments obtained by means of a flow of air (8) and extracting them in a slot (11) by
means of suction generated by a device (14) adapted under the collecting belt (4) at the

level of the slot (11) and, finally, laying said extracted filaments on said collecting belt (4)
or separating means, without preferential orientation and in a homogeneous manner.
Method according to claim 12, characterised in that it comprises maintaining the
extruder (2) at a temperature of between 245° C and 295° C.
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that it comprises pushing the molten
material through a die having a plurality of holes in alignment, then extracting the filaments

obtained by means of hot air currents circulatory around the die and in the direction of the
collecting belt and, finally, projecting said filaments, without preferential orientation and in

a homogeneous manner, onto said moving collecting belt.
Method according to any of claims 9 to 14, characterised in that the temperature of
the molten material produced from the extruder (2) is fixed, on the one hand, by a first

heating circuit (12) comprising a first heat-carrying fluid, during its transportation from the
extruder (2) to the die (3, 3') and, on the other hand, by a second heating circuit (13)

comprising a second heat-carrying fluid, distinct from said first devices and fluids, at the
level of the die (3, 3'), said molten material thus being able to be carried at different

temperatures depending on the operations to be carried out.
Method according to any of claims 9 to 15, characterised in that it comprises feeding
the die (3, 3') by means of volumetric pumps (14) connected to the outlet of the extruder

(2) or through the intermediary of a high-pressure pump (15).
Method according to any of claims 9 to 16, characterised in that the rate of
extraction of the filaments is between 100% and 1000%. 
Method according to any of claims 9 to 17, characterised in that the sheet of nonwoven
fabric obtained is treated by impregnation or by pulverisation with surfactants.
Use of a non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 8 as a partial component
of or as a single constituent of a disposable article, more especially for single usage.
Use of a non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 8 as a hydrophilic
component, more especially a surface sheet, of a disposable hygienic product, for example

a nappy or sanitary towel for single usage.
Use of a non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 8 as a hydrophobic
component, more especially a barrier surface, of a disposable hygienic product, for

example a nappy or sanitary towel for single usage.
Use of a non-woven fabric according to any of claims 1 to 8 as a matting or
protection sheet for cultures.
