<ABSTRACT>
Apparatuses for treating liquids by radiation, in particular UV radiation, possess treatment paths (10, 11) having light-permeable inner tubes (30) which receive UV lamps (32) and round the outside of which the liquid to be treated flows. The liquid contact causes the outer walls of the inner tubes (30) to become dirty, as a result of which the inner tubes (30) lose their light permeability and the efficacy of the treatment is impaired. It is therefore necessary to clean the inner tubes (30). The cleaning devices used for this purpose have the disadvantage that no treatment of the liquid can take place while the inner tubes (30) are being cleaned. In the apparatus according to the invention, the cleaning device is constructed in such a way that it possesses mechanically driven cleaning rings (34) which only partially fill the cross-section of the treatment compartment (31) of the treatment paths (10, 11). This enables the cleaning rings (34) to slide in opposite directions on the inner tubes (30) during the treatment of the liquids, because the liquids to be treated can flow past the cleaning rings (34). The invention is particularly suitable for the oxidation by ultraviolet radiation of organically contaminated liquids.

Apparatus for the treatment of liquids by
irradiation with, in particular, UV rays, having a

plurality of successive treatment stages (10, 11)
connected by connecting stages (19) and each serving

for irradiation, each treatment stage (10, 11)
consisting of an outer tube (29) and of an inner tube

(30) of smaller diameter, for the formation of
treatment spaces (31) between the outer wall of the

inner tube (30) and the inner wall of the outer tube
(29), through which treatment spaces the liquids can be

conveyed in succession, at least one radiation source
being arranged in the inner tube (30), characterized in

that individual treatment stages (10, 11) or groups
(12, 13, 14) of a plurality of treatment stages (10,

11) can be bypassed and/or shut off in such a way that
the liquid can flow only through treatment stages (10,

11) which are still open.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the treatment stages (10, 11) or groups (12,

13, 14) of a plurality of treatment stages (10, 11) can
be bypassed and/or shut off individually or together.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the connecting stages and/or the

inflow ends (17) or outflow ends (20) of the treatment
stages (10, 11) are provided with shut-off members (25,

26, 27, 28). 
Apparatus according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that those ends (22, 23) of two

treatment stages (10, 11) which are directed towards
one another are connected by means of an overflow duct

(24) so as to form a group (12, 13, 14).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1
to 4, characterized in that inflow ends (17) and

outflow ends (20) of the treatment stages (10, 11) of
each group (12, 13, 14) are connected to one another by

means of a connecting duct (19).
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the connecting duct (19) has a shut-off member

(25, 26, 27) between the inflow end (17) and the
outflow end (20) of each group (12, 13, 14) of two

treatment stages (10, 11).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that a shut-off member (28) is

arranged in the regions of the inflow ends (17) and of
the outflow ends (20) of each treatment stage (10, 11).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1
to 7, characterized in that the treatment stages (11,

12) are releasably connected to the junction ducts (18,
21) and the overflow ducts (24).
Apparatus according to one or more of Claims 1
to 8, characterized in that each treatment stage (10,

11) or each group (12, 13, 14) of a plurality of
treatment stages (10, 11) is provided with a bypass

preferably capable of being shut off.
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized
in that both ends of the treatment stages (10, 11) or

groups (12, 13, 14) of treatment stages (10, 11) are
provided with a shut-off member, in particular a

2/3-way valve, for the selective release of the flow
through the bypass or the treatment stage (10, 11) or

treatment stages (10, 11).
