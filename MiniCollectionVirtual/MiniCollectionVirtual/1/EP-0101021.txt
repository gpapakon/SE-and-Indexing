<ABSTRACT>
A transformer is fixed between two electrically insulatÂ­
ing plates (20) extending through a hollow porcelain tube 

(14) connected at both ends to an upper and a lower tank (10, 
12) through packings (16) respectively and two compression 

controlled helicel springs (26) are disposed in the upper tank 
(10) to controllably tension the mating electrical insulating 

plates (20) with respect to the lower tank (12). The upper tank 
(10) is also connected to the lower tank (12) by means of at 

least three supporting rods (32) disposed on the outside of 
the porcelain tube (14) and including one end fixed to the 

upper tank (10) and the other ends threaded and coupled to 
threaded studs (36) welded to the lower tank (12) through 

turnbuckles (38) with a cushion (40) interposed between the 
supporting rods (32) and the porcelain tube (14).
