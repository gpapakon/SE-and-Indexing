<ABSTRACT>
A system for cutting and spraying a plurality of resin strands with an emulsion. The system includes a spray gun (12) that has a cutter assembly (58) that cuts a single resin thread into a plurality of individual strands. The cutter assembly (58) is constructed to cut the strands into varying lengths. The strands are blown from the gun by a housing that is connected to a source of pressurized air. The housing has a pair of openings that are adapted to blow the strands parallel with the gun, so that the resin lies flat on the working surface. The gun (12) also has a pair of nozzles (66) attached to the housing (54) and coupled to a progressive cavity pump (20) that supplies an emulsion. The nozzles (66) are adapted to spray the emulsion into the path of the resin spray, so that the resin and emulsion are mixed onto the working surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an emulsion/strands
composition that is sprayed onto a working surface with
a spray gun that cuts threads into strands having
varying lengths.There has existed building materials which can be
constructed by spraying a working surface with an
emulsion. The emulsion is typically a mixture of
asphalt, clay and water. After the emulsion is sprayed
onto the surface, the water evaporates and the emulsion such as asphalt
hardens into a solid structure. Such a process is
typically used to cover the roof of a building.To improve the strength of the asphalt structure,
strands are typically sprayed with the emulsion. The strands
add stiffness to the structure and prevents the asphalt
from easily cracking or tearing. The most commonly used
thread is fiber glass which is cut into strands and blown
onto the working surface with the asphalt emulsion. U. S. Patent No. 3,155,320 issued to Jones; U. S.
Patent No. 3,947,962 issued to Smith et al; U. S. Patent
No. 3,111,272 issued to Underdown et al and U. S. Patent
Nos. 3,249,307 and 3,504,861 issued to Peeps et al,
disclose spray guns used to spray emulsion and glass
fibers onto a surface. The spray guns have a cutting
wheel that is typically rotated by a friction wheel
which feeds a single fiber glass thread between the two
wheels. The cutting wheel has a number of blades that
can rotate and cut the thread into individual strands.
The strands are then blown by the spray gun onto the
working surface. The blades of the cutting wheel are
spaced apart an equal distance, so that the individual
strands all have the same length. The guns typically
have a pair of nozzles that are attached to a
pressurized source of emulsion. The nozzles are
oriented to spray the emulsion into the path of the
strands, so that the emulsion and strands are mixed
together on the surface.As disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 3,829,016 issued to
Scharfenberger, the typical length of a strand is
between 1.27-3.81 cm
(0.5-1.5 inches). Although using glass strands of
such size is an effective way of spraying and mixing the
strands with the emulsion, it has been found that the
resulting harden composition is relatively weak.U.S. Patent No. 3,096,225 issued to Carr et al and 
U.S. Patent No. 3,212,691 issued to Lockshaw disclose a
method of constructing an emulsion/strands composition by
blowing a continuous thread of strand(s) of fiber glass onto the
working surface. Although a continuous strand of fiber
increases the strength of the resulting asphalt
composition, it is
