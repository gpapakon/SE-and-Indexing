<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing p,p'-biphenyl by the 
dealkylation reaction of 3,3',5,5'-tetra-t-butyl-4,4'-dihydroxybiphenyl, 

said reaction being carried out in the 
presence of an acid catalyst using as solvent a saturated 

hydrocarbon having a boiling point of 190°C or above, an 
alicyclic hydrocarbon having a boiling point of 190°C or 

above, a hydrocarbon with an iodine value of no more than 
1, sulfolane, or a mixture of these solvents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing p,p'-biphenol. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a process for producing p,p'-biphenol 
by dealkylating 3,3',5,5'-tetra-t-butyl-4.4'-dihydroxybiphenyl. It is known that when phenols, in particular alkyl-substituted 
phenols, are oxidized under certain 
conditions, biphenols and dipheno-quinone compounds are 
produced by an oxidative coupling reaction. Among the 
products obtained, p,p'-biphenol is useful as the starting 
material for the synthesis of polyesters or 
polycarbonates, as an intermediate for the production of 
dyes, pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals, as the starting 
material for the production of liquid-crystal polymers, or 
as a photographic agent. Because of this great variety of 
applications in which p,p'-biphenol finds its potential 
use, this compound has drawn much attention from 
researchers in various fields of industry. When 3,3',5,5'-tetra-t-butyl-4,4'-dihidoxybiphenyl 
(hereinafter sometimes abbreviated as TTBP) is dealkylated 
in the presence of both a solvent and a catalyst to obtain 
p,p'-biphenol (which is hereinafter sometimes abbreviated 
as DHBP), isobutene is also produced as a by-product. 
This isobutene is also important for industrial purposes 
since it can be polymerized into isooctane and polymeric 
gasoline or can be used as a starting material for the 
production of butyl rubber by copolymerization of isoprene 
and isobutene. While several methods have heretofore been proposed 
in the art of producing p,p'-biphenol from 3,3',5,5'-tetra-t-butyl-4,4'-biphenol  
 
(hereinafter sometimes 
abbreviated as TTBP), they all have their own problems as 
described below. Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 92332/l980 
filed by UCC (the term OPI as used herein means an 
unexamined published Japanese patent application) 
discloses a process for producing p,p'-biphenol by 
debutylating TTBP in the absence of both a solvent and a 
catalyst but this method is not practical for industrial 
purposes since it requires temperatures of at least 300°C. Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 1434/1984 
discloses a process for simultaneous production of p,p'-biphenol 
and meta-t-butylphenol by reacting TTBP and 
phenol under heating in the presence of an activated clay 
catalyst so that the t-butyl group of TTBP is 
transalkylated on meta-position of phenol. This method 
also is not practical for the purpose of industrial 
production of p,p'-biphenol from TTBP since the meta-t-butylphenol 
produced from TTBP
