<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle window mosquito net comprising a frame (4) and a net (3). The frame has four sides (10, 11, 12, 13) of which three may be attached to the window frame (2) while the fourth (10) is designed to be directed towards the inside of the window opening. A flange (5) which is parallel to the inner side (10) of the frame extends along the whole length thereof so that when the mosquito net is attached to the top of the window frame, it partially covers the closed window pane from the upper side of the window frame and over the whole width of the window opening (38). The flange engages the window pane over its whole width so that, when the window pane is partially lowered, said flange remains in engagement therewith and prevents insects from entering the passenger compartment.
