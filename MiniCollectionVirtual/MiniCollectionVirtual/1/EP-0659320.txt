<ABSTRACT>
A switching arrangement that can be connected in a communications channel that comprises a pair of lines, between sets of terminal equipment, which comprises: (i) a line switch (6, 7), that is series connected in each of the lines; and (ii) a control circuit (8) for the line switches comprising: (a) a charge reservoir (9) that is connected between the lines; (b) a reservoir charging switch (10) that is connected in series with the charge reservoir and controls the charging of the reservoir in response to a signal on the line; and (c) a reservoir discharging switch (11) that is controlled by a signal on the line and will allow the reservoir (9) when charged to energise control terminals of the line switches so that the line switches (6, 7) can maintain in an open state for a period of time by discharging of the reservoir.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communications circuits, and especially
to maintenance termination units for use in telephone circuits.In recent years, and especially in view of deregulation of many
telephone systems, privately owned communication equipment has
increasingly been installed in the premises of subscribers to the
system, with the result that it is often necessary to determine whether
any fault is located in the telephone line, or in the subscriber's
premises, ie in the subscriber's equipment or cabling, in order to
determine whose responsibility it is to repair the fault. It is highly
advantageous economically if this determination can be performed
remotely by sending an appropriate signal from the local exchange
along the line, thereby obviating the necessity to send any telephone
company personnel to the subscriber's premises.In order to test the telephone line for any faults it is necessary
firstly to install a so-called "maintenance termination unit" or MTU in
the line at the subscriber's premises which can disconnect the
subscriber equipment from the line (often called sectionalizing the line) 
and connect the A and B or tip and ring lines on receipt of the
appropriate signals from the exchange. During the line testing
procedure determinations will typically be made of the line to line
resistance and of the first and second line to ground resistance. Also
the line continuity can be determined by detecting the presence of the
MTU electronically.Various forms of MTU are described, for example, in US Patent
No 4,710,949 to Om Ahuja. This device comprises a pair of voltage
sensitive switches, one located in each of the tip and ring lines, and a
distinctive termination connecting the tip and ring lines on the
subscriber side of the voltage-sensitive switches. The voltage-sensitive
switches may each have a threshold voltage of about 16 volts so that
they are closed in normal operation by the 48 volt battery voltage but
will open when this is replaced by a test voltage below about 32 volts
removed in order to test the line-to-ground and tip-to-ring impedances.
The distinctive termination may, for example, comprise a back-to-back
diode and Zener diode which will exhibit an asymmetric resistance
when large voltages (higher than the operating voltages) of different
polarity are applied. Other forms of MTU have been proposed in which
the switches can be actuated by signals other than d.c. signals of one
frequency and send back signals of another frequency.Generally however, these MTUs suffer from the

<CLAIMS>
A switching device that can be connected in a communication channel
that comprises a pair of lines between a subscriber and an exchange

said switching device comprising

(i) a line switch (6, 7) that is series connected in each of said lines, each
said switch comprising a switching transistor (T1, T2, T3, T5, T6, T7)

whose base or gate voltage is controlled by an overcurrent control
element (T4, T8) that can turn on thereby switching the switching

transistor off,
(ii) said control element for the line switches giving a leakage current
between the two lines,

characterised in that a normally closed solid state relay (S3, S4) is provided to

block the leakage current when said relay is opened, said relay being
controlled by a relay control circuit (8) which is on the subscriber side of the

line switches, and said relay control circuit comprises

(a) a charge reservoir (9) that is connected between the lines,
(b) a reservoir charging switch (10), that is connected in series with the
charge reservoir and controls the charging of the reservoir in response

to a signal on the line; and
(c) a reservoir discharging switch (11) that is controlled by a signal on the
line and will allow the reservoir when charged to energize control

terminals of the line switches so that the line switches can be
maintained in an open state for a period of time by discharging of the

reservoir.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, which
includes means for reclosing the line switches a predetermined time

after they have opened.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the reservoir charging and/or discharging switches (10,11) comprise solid state

relays.
An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein
the reservoir charging and/or discharging switches (10,11) each are capable of being controlled

by a d.c. voltage on the line.
An arrangement as claimed in claim 4, where in the reservoir
charging switch (10) is normally open and is closed when the line voltage is

raised to a first voltage (V1), and the reservoir discharging switch (11) is
normally closed and is opened when the line voltage is raised to a

second voltage (V2) which is higher that V1, so that the reservoir (9) can
be charged by raising the line voltage to about V2 for a period of time,

and the line switches (6,7) can then be opened by reducing the line voltage
to a voltage below V1, thereby allowing the reservoir to energise the

control terminals of the line switches.
An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, which
includes a ringing bypass circuit (28,29) associated with each line that will

prevent triggering of the line switches by ringing signals on the lines.
An arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, which
includes a shunt switching circuit that can connect the lines together,

optionally via a distinctive termination, to enable a loopback test to be
performed on the channel.
