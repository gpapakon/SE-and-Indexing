<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an airborne FM-CW radar which is suitable in particular for use as a landing aid for aircraft in conditions of low visibility. The radar is based on an antenna with frequency-controlled beam steering. This gives high resolution and very flexible and rapid adjustment to changes in the area being monitored, e.g. a runway.

Method of monitoring an area with the assistance of a frequency-modulated
continuous signal radar, wherein


a frequency-modulated continuous wave transmission signal is transmitted by a
transmission antenna, in which the azimuthal primary direction of the directive

pattern depends on the frequency of the transmitted signal,
a part of the transmitted signal, which is reflected by the area to be monitored, is
received by a receiving antenna in which the azimuthal primary direction of the

directive pattern depends on the frequency of the received signal,
a coherent signal processing is carried out for evaluation of the received signal,
an azimuthal region, which is divided into a presettable number of mutually
adjoining azimuthal increments and in which an azimuthal swivelling of the directive

pattern of the transmission antenna is effected by a change in frequency of the
transmitted signal, is selected with respect to a presettable direction and
a monotone change in the frequency of the transmitted signal is selected in each
increment, characterised thereby
that a change in phase of the transmitted and/or received signals is undertaken in
an increment by means of a phased array antenna arrangement so as to

compensate for the directional change, which is caused by the frequency
modulation of the transmitted signal, in the directive pattern.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that all increments have a
presettable equal duration in time.
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised thereby that the frequency of
the transmitted signal as well as the length of the increments in terms of time are selected

in dependence on the range as well as the radial and/or azimuthal resolution of the radar. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that at
least the transmission antenna as well as the receiving antenna are constructed as

components of an on-board radar for an aircraft.
Method according to one of the preceding claims for use in an aircraft as a landing
aid as well as taxiway monitoring, wherein the direction of movement of the aircraft is

selected as presettable direction of the transmission and/or receiving antennae and the
azimuthal region is arranged substantially symmetrically with respect to the presettable

direction.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that the
increments are so arranged that a coherent signal evaluation, which overlaps in time, is

carried out over the increments.
