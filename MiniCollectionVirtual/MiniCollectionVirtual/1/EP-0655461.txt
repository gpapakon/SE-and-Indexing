<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to novel cyclic amino acid derivatives
described below which are useful as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors and as neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC 3.4.24.11) inhibitors. The
compounds of the invention are particularly useful for the treatment of conditions
which are responsive to ACE and NEP inhibition, particularly cardiovascular
disorders, such as hypertension, renal insufficiency (including edema and salt
reduction), pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure and atherosclerosis. The
compounds of the invention are also useful for reducing elevated cholesterol
plasma levels in mammals.By virtue of their inhibition of neutral endopeptidase, the compounds of
the invention may also be useful for the treatment of pain, depression, certain
psychotic conditions, and cognitive disorders. Other potential indications include
the treatment of angina, premenstrual syndrome, Meniere's disease,
hyperaldosteronism, hypercalciuria, ascites, glaucoma, asthma and
gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome and gastric
hyperacidity.The present invention relates to cyclic amino acid derivatives of the
