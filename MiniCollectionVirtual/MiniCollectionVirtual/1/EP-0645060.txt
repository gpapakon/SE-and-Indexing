<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a device by means of which sine-wave signals with a singularity can be further processed into square-wave signals and by means of which the singularity can be clearly and reliably recognised. The sine-wave pulses are converted into square-wave pulses in such a way that the sides of the square-wave pulses always lie in the same place regardless of the height of the sine-wave signals. This is made possible because a side alternation in the square-wave signals is always triggered when the sine-wave signals pass through zero. The necessary signal processing and logic comparisons are performed in a suitable circuit and they also permit clear reference mark recognition.

Device for shaping a square-wave signal (S2)
and for unambiguous recognition of a singularity from a

sinusoidal signal (S1) with positive and negative
halfwaves and a singularity, having a conditioning

circuit (15) to which the sinusoidal signal (S1) is
fed, the conditioning circuit (15) comprising a logic

device (23) for signal release and a singularity
conditioning device, the logic device comprising a

counter, characterized in that the conditioning circuit
(15) comprises a first comparator (21), whose output

signal enables a zero crossover to be detected, and a
second comparator (22), which detects whether the

sinusoidal signal (S1) has dropped below a prescribable
threshold value (SW5), the logic device (23) comprising

an up/down counter (28) whose input is connected to the
output of the second comparator (22) and whose output

leads to a first input of an RS flip-flop (29) which is
connected via a second input to the output of the first

comparator (21), and an RS flip-flop (30) whose input
is connected to the output of the second comparator

(22), whose output leads to a further input of the RS
flip-flop (29) and whose other input is connected to

the output of the RS flip-flop (29), and the
conditioning circuit (15) checking, in each case at the

zero crossover (N) of the sinusoidal signal (S1),
whether there is either a change-over from a positive

level to a negative level or from a negative level to a
positive level, and in doing so bringing about, in each 

case at the change-over from the positive to the
negative level of the sinusoidal signal (S1) a level

change of the square-wave signal (S2) in a first
direction, provided a release for a high pulse is

present at the output of the up/down counter (28), and
bringing about, in each case at the change-over from

the negative level to the positive level of the
sinusoidal signal (S1), a level change of the

square-wave signal (S2) in the other direction,
provided, according to the additional checking of the

sinusoidal signal (S1) in the conditioning circuit
(15), the last negative halfwave of the sinusoidal

signal (S1) has dropped below the prescribable
threshold value (SW5), the prescribable threshold value

(S5) being defined as a function of the previous peak
value of the sinusoidal signal (S1).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the threshold value (SW5)is 50% of the previous

maximum.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the singularity can be detected by determining

the duration between prescribable signal edges of the
square-wave signal (S2), and the singularity is

detected if this duration has a significantly greater
value than the other intervals.
System comprising a device according to Claim
3, a magnetic sensor (14) and an ele
ment (10) which is
to be sensed, the device being used to evaluate the

output signal of the magnetic sensor which senses the
element (10) which rotates with a number of identical

marks (11) and at least one absent mark (12), the
rotating element having a singularity which is brought

about by the region of the absent mark (12) and a
singularity characterizes the reference mark of the

rotating element (10).
System according to Claim 4, characterized in
that the rotating element is a sensor disc which is

connected to a shaft, for example the crankshaft or cam
shaft of an internal combustion engine. 
System according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized
in that the conditioning circuit (15) has a series

resistor (18) via which the signal of the magnetic
sensor is fed, and in that the digital output signal to

be formed comes about at the output of the conditioning
circuit (15).
