<ABSTRACT>
Overflow fitting for a safety valve, comprising a beaker-like vessel (1) which is constructed with an outlet pipe (11) and is equipped with a funnel-like insert (2) and with an air trap in the form of a pipe (3) surrounding the funnel-like insert (2) and closed at its lower end, the upper edge of the funnel-like insert (2) being fixed to the upper edge of the beaker-like vessel (1). In this arrangement, the axis of the funnel nozzle (23) is arranged eccentrically with respect to the upper edge (21) of the insert (2), and the funnel-like insert (2) is rotatable with respect to the beaker-like vessel (1).

<CLAIMS>
An overflow fitting for a safety valve, comprising a cup-like 
vessel fitted with an outlet pipe, which vessel is 

provided with a funnel-type insert and with an air trap in 
the form of a tube surrounding the funnel-type insert and 

closed at its lower end, the upper edge of the funnel-type 
insert being attached to the upper edge of the cup-like 

vessel, characterised in that the axis of the funnel delivery 
tube (23) is arranged eccentrically with respect to the upper 

edge (21) of the insert (2) and in that the funnel-type 
insert (2) may be rotated with respect to the cup-like vessel 

(1). 
An overflow fitting according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the funnel-type insert (2) is constructed at its upper 

edge with a downwardly projecting cylindrical lug (21), which 
comes to rest against the inner wall of the cup-like vessel 

(1), and with an annular stop face (22), which comes to rest 
against the upper edge (12) of the cup-like vessel (1). 
An overflow fitting according to either one of claims 1 
and 2, characterised in that the eccentricity of the central 

axis of the funnel delivery tube (23) amounts to from 5 mm to 
15 mm, preferably 10 mm.
