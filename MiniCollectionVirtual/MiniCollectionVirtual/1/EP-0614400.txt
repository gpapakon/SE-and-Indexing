<ABSTRACT>
Impregnated activated carbon adsorbents for the removal of toxic materials from gas streams are used in a variety of respiration and collective filter applications. The impregnated activated carbon adsorbents of the present invention remain effective in removing toxic gases and/or vapors in industrial and other applications, and are free of chromium and its potential health hazards. Generally, these activated carbons are comprised of an activated carbon adsorbent impregnated so as to result in an activated carbon generally containing up to 10 % molybdenum and up to 10 % sulfate, 0 to 20 % copper, 0 to 20 % zinc, optionally supplemented according to the desired characteristics with water or otherwise provided with moisture. Aqueous ammonia may be used as a preparation solvent for impregnating the copper, zinc, molybdenum and/or sulfate. The universal adsorbent carbons of the present invention have been found to be effective for removing a variety of toxic gases and/or vapors, and provide simultaneous protection for CEN Classification gases of Types A, B, E and K. The specific agents that the present invention removes effectively includes chlorine, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, formaldehyde, carbon tetrachloride, ammonia and others.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to impregnated
activated carbon adsorbents for removal of toxic materials
in respirator and collective filter applications and, in
particular, to a universal chromium-free impregnated
carbon adsorbent for the removal of toxic gases and/or
vapors in industrial applications.Activated carbon has long been used to remove
toxic gases and vapors from a stream of gas or liquid.
These activated carbons are also useful in cleaning
breathing air or exhaust gases by removing various
noxious agents, and may be used in gas mask filters,
respirators, collective filters and other applications,
and often involve the use of special impregnants to remove
gases that would not otherwise be removed through the use
of unimpregnated, activated carbons. Prior formulations
contain chromium and/or other agents impregnated on an
activated carbon, and function as adsorbents effective in
removing a variety of toxic materials from a vapor or
liquid. In many applications, it is desirable that a
single impregnated adsorbent be effective against a range
of toxic agents in a gas stream. Known military use formulations designed to
remove gases such as cyanogen chloride, hydrogen cyanide
and cyanogen often contain chromium, copper, silver and
other metals impregnated on an activated carbon. These
adsorbents are effective in removing a large number of
toxic materials. Appendix I sets forth a summary of known
art involving these and other formulations.Copper and silver have been shown to be
effective in the removal of arsine and phosphine.
Chlorine, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride and
hydrogen sulfide are also removed by the presence of
copper impregnates on activated carbon.A number of references describe the various
impregnates that may be used on activated carbon:U.S. Patent No. 5,063,196 discloses copper, zinc
and triethylenediamine, along with other impregnates on
activated carbon for military and industrial applications.
U.S. Patent Application Nos. 07/537,311 (subject to
Secrecy Order) and 07/737,369, continuation-in-part
applications of this patent, disclose these and other
impregnates on activated carbon.British Patent No. 2,187,725 discloses activated
charcoal impregnated with transition metal salts
preferably consisting of cobalt, nickel or zinc acetate.U.S. Patent No. 3,355,317 to Keith et al.
discloses the use of the oxides of cobalt, copper, zinc,
iron and molybdenum on activated carbon to remove hydrogen
cyanide from tobacco smoke. U.S. Patent Nos. 2,920,050 to Blacet et al. and
