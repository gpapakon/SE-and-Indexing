<ABSTRACT>
Intersecting areas (3), free from flaking and chipping, of the passages (2) or grooves (2) forming rhombic patterns on fibre reinforced synthetic-resin rolls (7) are obtained if the external surface (14) of the fibre-reinforced base rolls (7) is provided with a firmly adhering synthetic-resin layer (6) containing ceramic, mineral or metallic fillers (12) and the channels (2) or grooves (2) are machined into this firmly adhering synthetic-resin layer (6). According to another variant, a firmly adhering filled synthetic-resin layer (15) can be connected to a firmly adhering layer (18, 19) which is sprayed on thermally and into which the rhombic pattern (2) is then machined. The channels (2) and grooves (2) can penetrate one or more layers (18, 19, 15, 6) and can also extend into the surface zone (13) of the base roll (7).

<CLAIMS>
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) having a base body
(7) of fibre-reinforced synthetic resin, wherein the

outer surface (14) of the base body (7), which surface
(14) is in the form of a cylinder jacket, is covered at

least in part by an adhering layer (6) of a
thermosetting synthetic resin containing at least one

particulate, wear-resistant filler (12), characterized
in that the roller (1) or cylinder (1) has in its

outwardly pointing surface (8), which is in the form of
a cylinder jacket, a lozenging consisting of

intersecting channels (2), which lozenging is free of
broken-off bits and/or chipping, with the channels (2)

which form the lozenging being so deep that they
penetrate the outer layer (6), which consists of a

wear-resistant filler (12) and the thermosetting
synthetic resin matrix, and reach into the surface zone

of the fibre-reinforced part of the base body (7).
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) according to claim
1, characterized in that the channels (2) forming the

lozenging reach as far as a depth of at most 300 µm
into the fibre-reinforced surface zone (13) of the base

body (7) of the roller (1) or cylinder (1).
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) according to claim
1 or 2, characterized in that the channels (2) forming

the lozenging have a depth of at most 2000 µm.
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) having a base body
(7) of fibre-reinforced synthetic resin, wherein the

outer surface (14) of the base body (7), which surface
(14) is in the form of a cylinder jacket, supports the

two successive layers (15), (18) described in the
following and is covered by them at least in part:


1. one layer (15) adhering to the surface (14) of the
base body (7), which surface (14) is in the form of a

cylinder jacket and which layer (15) consists of a
thermosetting synthetic resin containing a metallic, 

ceramic or mineral filler (12), the outer surface (16)
of which layer (15) has been processed in a materialeroding

manner in such a way that it has surfaces (17)
of filler particles (12) which are free of synthetic

resin, are clean, point to the outside and act as
bonding agents and
2. one wear-resistant layer (18) which adheres firmly
to the surface (16) created by the processing of the

surface of the filler-containing layer (15) and which
has been applied by means of a thermal spraying method,

characterized in that the roller (1) or cylinder (1) in
its outwardly directed, cylindrical surface (8) has a

lozenging which consists of intersecting channels (2)
and which is free of broken-off bits and/or chipping,

with the channels (2) which form the lozenging being so
deep that they penetrate the outer layer (18) which is

sprayed on thermally and the layer (15) located beneath
it, which consists of a wear-resistant filler (12) and

the thermosetting synthetic resin matrix, and reach
into the surface zone of the fibre-reinforced part of

the base body (7).
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) according to claim
4, characterized in that the channels (2) forming the

lozenging reach as far as a depth of at most 300 µm
into the fibre-reinforced surface zone (13) of the base

body (7) of the roller (1) or cylinder (1).
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) according to claim
4 or 5, characterized in that the channels (2) forming

the lozenging have a depth of at most 2000 µm.
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) according to one of
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the channels (2)

forming the lozenging have a cross-sectional form which
is free of corners and edges at least below the plane

of the roller surface (8).
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) according to one of
claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the base body (7) 

is reinforced with fibres of non-graphitic carbon or of
graphite.
Roller (1) or cylinder (1) according to one of
claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the zones of the

surface (8) of the roller (1) or cylinder (1) not
opened by the lozenging and the surfaces of the

channels forming the lozenging are covered by another
layer which is sprayed on thermally.
