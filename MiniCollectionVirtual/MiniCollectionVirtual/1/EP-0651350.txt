<ABSTRACT>
A substitute image is generated by dividing a full image into panels defined by a 
center (or focus) panel (202), for use in applications where the full image is not entirely 

displayable on a given display device at a necessary resolution. The full image is bounded by a 
bounding rectangle (200), the focus panel (202) is a rectangle with sides parallel to the sides of 

the bounding rectangle, and the focus panel (202) defines eight other panels, four side panels 
(204,206,208,210) and four corner panels (212). The substitute image (Fig.5) is the focus panel 

(202¹), with the side panels (204¹,206¹,208¹,210¹) folded into a smaller cross section, but 
remaining continuous with the focus panel, and the corner panels (212¹) folded and sheared to 

remain continuous with the side panels in a three-dimensional ("3D") space in which a 
viewpoint and a view plane representing the display surface is also located. To focus on an 

area of the image which is not under the focus panel, the viewer selects a point in the area of 
interest, and the display system moves the image so that the selected point is under the focus 

panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of visual displays of information and, more 
particularly, to an image display and method of displaying an image. An image is a visual display of information, or a logical representation of what is to 
become a visual display of information. One type of image is a text image. The information 
content of a text image is in the text of the image, but is also in the placement of the text in the 
image. For an image to be useful to a viewer, it must be displayed on a display device in such a 
way that the information content can be conveyed to the viewer. If the entire image can be 
displayed on the display device at the full resolution of the image, then no information is lost. 
However, information is often lost where a choice must be made between showing only a 
portion of the image at a minimum resolution which still allows the details to be seen, or 
showing the entire image at a resolution which shows the global patterns of the image but 
loses the details. Significant loss of detail in a text image would make the text unreadable. The resolution limitations of a display could either be due to the fineness of the 
display or the ability of the viewer to see fine features. For example, if two lines cannot be 
resolved into two lines on a pixelated display device, they will appear as a single line. The 
merger of the lines could be due to either the inability of the display to use separate pixels for 
the two lines or the inability of a viewer to see the separate pixels of the two lines. The image, when it is to be displayed on a display system such as a pixelated 
computer monitor, is usually stored in a digital computer as a collection of objects in a form 
understandable by a display system which, given an ideal display, might be displayable in their 
entirety. This stored form of the image, or the "full" image, by definition contains all of its 
information content. Examples of stored forms are bit maps (as in a low-end drawing program 
or photoediting system), object list files giving object characteristics and positions (as in a CAD 
system), vector image files, or text in the form of characters and formatting codes. The loss of information in an image occurs when the image is to be displayed on a 
display which cannot display all the information of the full image. For example, if a bit map 
comprises more pixels than are available on the display, the display could not show the image, 
and a substitute image, such as a lower resolution image of the bit map

<CLAIMS>
A method for displaying an image containing an amount of information, 
divided into a focus part and a context part, defining said image on a display 

surface capable of displaying a predetermined amount of image 
information, said method preserving said focus part in full detail and without 

distortion and the context relation between said focus part and said context 
part, and displaying said context part in lesser detail when the image to be 

displayed on said display surface contains an amount of image information 
exceeding said predetermined amount of image information, said method 

including: 

storing a data block representing objects appearing in the image, wherein a 
full image is an image generated from said data block without loss of image 

information;

positioning a representation of the display surface in said space, wherein 
said representation is bounded by boundaries corresponding to boundaries 

of the display surface;

transformation such that an edge of a corner panel which is coincident with 

a side panel edge before folding is again coincident with said side panel
