<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses an accumulator container comprising a box (2) presenting one or more element-containing cells (3), each of said cells presenting at least one tube (5) for the inlet of the electrolyte. Said tube (5) has one end connected with an opening (6) made in the lid and its other end arranged near the bottom of the container. Said box presents a lid having at least one first inlet opening (6), connected through channels (71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76) for the distribution of the electrolyte with electrolyte inletting tubes (5, 51), found in the box and in the lid, and at least one second outlet opening (11) connected with level tubes (81), each belonging to each cell.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a container especially suitable for 
accumulators that need be charged in a short time. 
According to some known techniques, some time ago the first 
charge of the accumulators was achieved by static immersion 
of the electrolyte in the container, while the same did not 
circulate. This technique required a very long charging 
time, sometimes exceeding 24 hours. Some more recent techniques, such as the one according to 
the dictates of the Swedish patent application 770184-9 in 
the name of the YUASA BATTERY Company, which describe a 
special device for the rapid charge of the accumulators 
achieved through the use of a cap, suited to be applied to 
the mouth of a lid for the charge of the electrolyte, 
wherein the cap comprises an inlet tube and an output tube 
through which the electrolyte which pre-sets the charge of 
each accumulator cell enters and exits. The electrolyte 
which is forced to circulate inside the accumulator is then 
cooled outside of it, since during the charging process 
heat develops, and by cooling the electrolyte the charge 
efficiency is increased and the charging time is then 
considerably shortened. However, the use of special caps 
also causes defects in the circulation of the electrolyte 
itself, due to the clogging of the cap after repeated 
charges. According to the Italian patent application No. VI93A000033 
registered in the name of the same applicant of the present 
invention, an accumulator container allowing a rapid 
charge is proposed, wherein, in each cell of the container 
box at least one tube for the inlet of the electrolyte is 
foreseen, arranged at an essentially vertical position, and 
communicating with one opening made on the container lid, 
while its other end was arranged close to the bottom; at 
least one level tube, always for each cell of electrolyte,  
 
was also foreseen, said level tube had one end communicating 
with the opening made on the lid and the other one 
coinciding with the level of electrolyte which it was 
necessary to reach inside each cell. According to a preferred embodiment of that invention, the 
level tubes are molded in the lid, while the tubes for the 
inlet of the electrolyte are partially molded in the lid 
for a first part, and the rest in the container box, and 
the two parts are joined together when the lid and the box 
are attached to each other. Each cell is provided with an entrance for the inlet of the 
electrolyte and an exit for the same. The charge of the 
electrolyte is produced by causing the
