<ABSTRACT>
A system for correcting for a time of flight delay of a 
drop of ink from an inkjet printhead includes a first 

mechanism (152) for scanning the printhead (102) along a 
first axis at a first velocity. A control circuit (300), 

responsive to inkjet timing signals, causes the printhead 
(102) to eject ink onto a media (30) to create a test 

pattern (40) thereon as the printhead (102) is scanned 
along the first axis. A sensor (200) optically senses the 

test pattern (40) and provides a time of flight dependent 
phase signal in response thereto. This signal is processed 

to provide time of flight delay corrected inkjet timing 
signals for the first velocity in response to the phase 

signal. In a particular implementation, the processor (170) 
is adapted to add an additional delay to the corrected 

timing signals to correct for curvature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printers and
plotters. More specifically, the present invention
relates to inkjet printers and plotters having multiple
pens for multi-color operation.While the present invention is described herein with
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular
applications, it should be understood that the invention
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will
recognize additional modifications, applications, and
embodiments within the scope thereof and additional
fields in which the present invention would be of
significant utility.Inkjet printer/plotters, such as those sold by
Hewlett Packard Company, offer substantial improvements
in speed over the conventional X-Y plotter. Inkjet
printer/plotters typically include a pen having an array
of nozzles. The pens are mounted on a carriage which is
moved across the page in successive swaths. Each inkjet
pen has heater circuits which, when activated, cause ink
to be ejected from associated nozzles. As the pen 
is positioned over a given location, a jet of ink is
ejected from the nozzle to provide a pixel of ink at
a desired location. The mosaic of pixels thus created
provides a desired composite image.Inkjet technology is now well known in the art.
See, for example, U. S. Patents Nos. 4,872,027, entitled
PRINTER HAVING IDENTIFIABLE INTERCHANGEABLE HEADS, issued
October 3, 1989, to W. A. Buskirk et al. and 4,965,593,
entitled PRINT QUALITY OF DOT PRINTERS, issued October
23, 1990, to M. S. Hickman.Recently, full color inkjet printer/plotters have
been developed which comprise a plurality of inkjet pens
of diverse colors. A typical color inkjet
printer/plotter has four inkjet pens, one that stores
black ink, and three that store colored inks, e.g.,
magenta, cyan and yellow. The colors from the three
color pens are mixed to obtain any particular color.The pens are typically mounted in stalls within an
assembly which is mounted on the carriage of the
printer/plotter. The carriage assembly positions the
inkjet pens and typically holds the circuitry required
for interface to the heater circuits in the inkjet pens.Full color printing and plotting requires that the
colors from the individual pens be precisely applied to
the media. This requires precise alignment of the
carriage assembly. Unfortunately, mechanical
misalignment of the pens in conventional inkjet
printer/plotters results in offsets in the x direction
(in the media or paper axis) and in the y direction (in
the

A system for correcting for a time of flight delay of
a drop of ink from an inkjet printhead (102) comprising:


a mechanism (110) for scanning the printhead along an
axis;
a control circuit (300) responsive to inkjet timing
signals for causing the printhead, as it is scanned along the

axis, to eject ink onto a media (30) to create a test pattern
(40) thereon from which time of flight information can be

derived;
a sensor (210) for optically sensing the test pattern
(40) and providing a time of flight dependent phase signal

in response thereto; and
a processor (170) for providing time of flight delay
corrected inkjet timing signals in response to the phase

signal,

   characterised in that said scanning mechanism (110)
scans the printhead in both directions along said axis, and

in that the control circuit (300) causes a first portion of
said test pattern to be printed by said printhead in a

forward direction and a second portion of said test pattern
to be printed by said printhead in a reverse direction.
A system according to claim 1, wherein the test pattern
(40) includes a plurality of horizontally spaced vertical

bars (404, 406).
A system according to claim 1 or 2, wherein different
portions of the test pattern are printed at different speeds.
A system according to any preceding claim, wherein the
sensor (210) includes a phase plate (230) in optical

alignment with a photodetector (240).
A system according to claim 4, wherein the phase plate
(230) includes a plurality of apertures horizontally spaced. 
A system according to claim 5, wherein spacing of the
apertures is equal to the spacing of the bars.
A system according to any of claims 4 to 6, wherein the
processor (170) is programmed to determine the frequency of

the signal detected by the photodetector (240) and provides

signal to a spatial frequency of the test pattern (40) and
provide the flight delay corrected inkjet timing signals in

response thereto.
A system according to any preceding claim, wherein the
processor (170) adds an additional delay to the corrected

timing signals to correct for curvature.
