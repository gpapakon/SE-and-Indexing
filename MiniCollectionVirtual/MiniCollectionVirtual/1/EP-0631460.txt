<ABSTRACT>
The radiation noise suppression effect is enhanced by 
providing an insulation layer which is formed so that the 

circuit pattern is covered excepting at least a part of 
power source pattern or ground pattern on the substrate on 

which circuit pattern is formed, and a conductive layer 
which is formed so as to be connected to the uninsulated 

part of the power source pattern or the ground pattern on 
the insulation layer, by modifying pattern shape of the 

conductive layer and the insulation layer or by increasing 
or reducing the number of these layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a printed circuit board e.g. for
use in electronic equipment, such as a printed
circuit board for which electromagnetic interference (EMI)
preventing means is taken.The recent progress of electronic equipments is
facilitating the trend toward increase of operation speed
and density of circuit formed as printed circuit board, as
a result which regulations are becoming more severe. One
of the typical EMI preventing means which are
conventionally applied is to reduce the radiation noise
and incoming noise by covering printed circuit board with
the shield case.However, this method causes a problem that the
electromagnetic wave energy enclosed in the shield case is
emitted outwards through cables. Moreover, since this
method is not basically intended to reduce the
electromagnetic wave energy which is generated due to high
frequency characteristics of circuit. Therefore it is
almost impossible to completely suppress the radiation 
noise. Hence, a new printed circuit board against EMI has
been proposed (USP4,801,489 = EP-A-0 238 267). This printed circuit
board features that an insulation layer (hereinafter this
insulation layer is called the undercoat layer) is formed,
excepting at least a part of ground pattern, on a substrate
on which a signal line pattern (hereinafter referred to as
signal pattern), a ground line pattern (herein after
referred to as ground pattern) and a power line pattern
(hereinafter referred to as power supply pattern) are
formed, and a conductive layer such as conductive paste
layer is formed thereon so as to be connected to an
uninsulated part of the ground pattern.Usually, another insulation layer (hereinafter
referred to as overcoat layer) is formed on this conductive
layer.Radiation noise can be reduced in the printed circuit
boards of such a configuration mainly for the following
four reasons.Firstly, reduction of ground pattern impedance by
conductive layer.Secondly, removal of high frequency component from
signal pattern and power supply pattern by adjacent
conductive layer. That is, since the undercoat layer which
is formed with so-called solder resist is thin, about 20 to
40Âµm in thickness, the distributed electrostatic capacity 
of signal pattern and power supply pattern with respect to
the conductive layer which is formed thereon and connected
to the ground pattern is significant. Accordingly,
unnecessary high frequency component which is generated by
ringing is grounded to the ground pattern with high
frequency, so that the radiation noise is
