<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing pig iron and cement clinker in a melting gasifier (3), the charge is at least partially preheated and if required deacidified and prereduced or scrap is used as charge. Coal is blown into a fluidized bed (7) and is gasified, reducing the charge, and pig iron (8), as well as slag (9), are drawn off in the liquid state. If required, the batch of lime introduced into the melting gasifier (3) is preheated and calcined together with a partial amount of iron ore in a preheating shaft (1) and is fed in according to the desired clinker composition.

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing pig iron and cement clinker in a
melter gasifier (4), in which the charge is introduced in a

state at least partially preheated and, if required,
deacidified and prereduced or in the form of scrap, coal is

blown into a fluidized bed (7) and gasified while reducing the
charge and pig iron as well as slag are drawn off in the

liquid state, characterized in that the lime batch fed to the
melter gasifier (4) is preheated and calcined in a preheating

shaft (1) and introduced as a function of the cement clinker
composition desired.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
lime batch is preheated and calcined together with a partial

amount of an iron ore.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
a partial amount of the preheated calcinate is mixed in a

clinker plant with the slag of the melter gasifier (4) tapped
in the liquid state.
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in
that chlorine-containing waste substances such as, for

instance, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) loaded with dioxins
and furans are blown into the melter gasifier (4) or into the

preheating shaft (1) together with the combustion air.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the product gas of the melter gasifier

(4) is purified in a hot cyclone under condensation of alkali
and optionally heavy metal compounds.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the purified product gas is burnt with

cooling air obtained from the cooling of the clinker 
solidifying from the slag and is used for calcining the

charging material from carbonated starting material.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that excess iron oxide in the slag is reduced

with an iron bath (8) depositing.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that liquid converter slag is added to the

molten melter gasifier slag (9) in an amount sufficient for
processing residual iron.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that cooling of the melting clinker is

effected at temperatures of above 1000°C in a fluidized bed
cooler, using cooling air.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the retention time at temperatures of

above 1000°C for the formation of the cement clinker phases
alite and belite is chosen to be at least 15 minutes and,

preferably, 25 to 30 minutes.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that sulfidically bound sulfur as well as

calcium carbide are oxidized to SO
3
 and CaO and CO
2,

respectively, in the clinker plant.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that oil shale, waste, waste scrap or steel

works slag or dusts are charged with coal into the melter
gasifier (4).
