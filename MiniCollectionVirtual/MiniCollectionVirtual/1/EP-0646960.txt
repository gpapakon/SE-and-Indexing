<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a semiconductor device with a semiconductor 
body (1) comprising a semiconductor element with connection points (2, 3) which 

adjoins a surface (4) of the semiconductor body (1) and is laterally insulated and 
surrounded by a first depression (5) in the surface (4), which depression (5) is provided 

with a wall (6) and a bottom (7), while the surface (4) of the semiconductor body (1) 
and the wall (6) and bottom (7) of the depression (5) are covered with an insulating 

layer (8), the connection points (2, 3) being provided in the insulating layer (8) on the 
surface (4) of the semiconductor body (1) and being connected to conductor tracks (10, 

11) which connect the connection points (2, 3) across a wall (6) to connection surfaces 
(12, 13) associated with the connection points (2, 3) and situated on the bottom (7). 
It is found in practice that, in the case of a progressive miniaturization, 

the manufacture of such devices leads to rejects caused by short-circuits between 
connection surfaces (12, 13). 
According to the invention, one or several further depressions (50) 
surrounded by the first depression (5) is/are present in the surfce 4 of the semiconductor 

body (1), while only one connection surface (12, 13) is present on the bottom (7, 57) of 
each of the first and further depressions (5, 50), which connection surface is connected 

to a connection point (2, 3) on the surface (4) of the semiconductor body (1) 
via
 a 
conductor track (10, 11).

 
Short-circuits are found to take place in the known semiconductor devices on a wall (6) 

of the depression (5) when there are more than one conductor tracks (10, 11) on this 
wall (6). Thanks to the measure according to the invention, only one conductor track 

(10 or 11) is present on the wall (6, 56) of the depression (5, 50), so short-circuits with 
other conductor tracks on the wall (6, 56) cannot arise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device as defined in the
pre characterizing part of claim 1.Such a device is also known as a semiconductor device with mesa
insulation. The semiconductor element for example is a bipolar transistor whereby the
semiconductor zones provided in the upper surface of the mesa are the base- and the
emitterzone of the transistor. These semiconductor zones are connected to bond pads
by means of conductor tracks provided on the insulating layer. In this example the
emitterzones are connected to an emitter bond pad, the base zone to a base bond pad.
The bond pads serve to make electrical contact with connection legs of a lead frame, for
example, through bond wires or contact elevations, so-called bumps. The bond pads are
comparatively large in order to facilitate such a contact. The bond pads accordingly are
present next to the mesa on the surface of the semiconductor substrate and not on top of
the mesa. Placement of comparatively large bond pads on top of the mesas would lead to
an enlargement of the mesa, which leads to high capacitances in the element. This may
render the element unsuitable for high frequencies.Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 16, no. 330 [4-199719] discloses a device
of the kind mentioned before with a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) as a
semiconductor element. This element comprises a gate-, source - and drainzone formed
in the upper surface of the mesa. These zones are connected through conductor tracks to
bond pads on the surface of the substrate next to the mesa.In practice, semiconductor devices with ever smaller details are
manufactured owing to an increasing miniaturization. The known semiconductor device
has the disadvantage that the manufacture of miniaturized known semiconductor bodies
leads to rejects owing to short-circuits between bond pads of the semiconductor element.The invention has for its object inter alia to design the semiconductor
device mentioned in the opening paragraph in such a manner that the said disadvantage
does not occur. According to the invention, the device is for this purpose characterized by
the features mentioned in the characterizing part of claim 1.It is found that short-circuits between the conductor tracks which connect
the semiconductor zones to the bond pads may occur in the known device. The
invention is based on the recognition that these short-circuits take place when more than
one conductor track is present on the wall of the mesa. The short-circuit is found to
take place between the tracks
