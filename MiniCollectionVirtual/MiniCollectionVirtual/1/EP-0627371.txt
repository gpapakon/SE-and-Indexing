<ABSTRACT>
By means of the method according to the invention, any assortments of product elements of any product range are formed, the said assortments consisting of any number of any size of groups of elements of the same product. A dispenser having an input and an output matrix (SE, SA) and buffers (P) arranged between the matrices is used for carrying out the method. Product elements, combined to form product transport units by means of auxiliary packaging/transport material, are feed-conveyed. The elements are separated from the transport units and supplied to the input matrix (SE). The elements are introduced into the buffers (P) by means of the input matrix and are supplied to the output matrix (SA) by way of the buffers. Elements corresponding to the assortment formation are extracted from the output matrix and are combined to form assortment transport units by means of auxiliary packaging/transport material, the said transport units being conveyed away. The auxiliary packaging/transport material is guided from the separation of the elements to the combination of the assortments. The dispenser Dxyz has x times y buffers with a capacity z. If the same products are always introduced into each buffer at the input SE, then the "profile" remains uniform in each plane from SE to SA, and the buffer is itself non-grouped. However, as soon as the type of product at the input SE is changed, then the respective buffer is grouped, its capacity breaks down into different capacities Zpartial and a profile within the dispenser is obtained. This affords the possibility of always operating a dispenser at its maximum variety level, with the result that the commissioning throughput can be increased to an extreme degree.

Method for forming ranges from product elements of a random product 
offer, said ranges comprising a random number of randomly large groups (G) 

of elements of the same product, with the aid of a dispenser (D), comprising 
a plurality (xy) of buffers (P) with a capacity (z), the inputs of 

the buffers forming an input matrix (SE) of the dispenser and the outputs 
of the buffers an output matrix (SA) of the dispenser, characterized in 

that the products are supplied in the form of transportation units to at 
least one individualizing station, that the products are individualized 

to elements in the individualizing station by the separation of auxiliary 
material for forming transportation units, that the individualized elements 

are supplied to the input matrix, that the input matrix fills the elements 
into the buffers and are supplied via said buffers to the output matrix, 

that product elements are removed in removal steps according to the range 
formation from the output matrix and supplied to at least one combining 

station, that the removed product elements are combined in the combining 
station with the aid of auxiliary material for forming transportation units 

to give range transportation units and that the range transportation units 
are conveyed away, the auxiliary material for forming the transportation 

units is transported from the at least one individualizing station to the 
at least one combining station and in which for adapting the number and 

nature of the different goods handlable by the dispenser to the ranges to 
be formed, a real basic range available at the output matrix for ranging 

purposes is modified in that by the programmed filling of product elements 
of predetermined products into the input matrix modified, virtual basic 

ranges are given, which are moved by the removal steps through the buffers 
against the output matrix where, after a number of removal steps, they are 

available as real, modified basic ranges for ranging. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that elements in the 
buffers are conveyed in cyclic manner and/or are removed in cyclic manner 

from the output matrix. 
Method according to claim 2, characterized in that the conveying cycles 
in the buffers are initiated by removal means at the output matrix, which  

 
leads to an individually timed removal. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
the auxiliary material for forming transportation units comprises pallets. 
Apparatus for performing the method according to one of the claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that it has a dispenser comprising an arrangement of 

channel-like buffers, whose inputs form an input matrix (SE) and whose 
outputs form an output matrix (SA), whereby in said buffers can be received 

product elements, which can be transported and from said buffers can be 
removed product elements at given times, that it has loading (22, 20') and 

removal (22, 15') means, which reach the inputs and outputs of the buffers, 
that it has at least one individualizing station (16) associated with the 

buffer product input and at least one combining station (16, 13) associated 
with the buffer product output, that from the individualizing stations to 

the combining stations are provided conveying means (11, 12, 14) for 
auxiliary material for forming transportation units and that it has control 

means for controlling at least the loading means and removal means with 
respect to the buffer arrangement. 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that timing means are 
provided through which the products are transported into the buffers with 

timing pulses. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterized in that the loading 
and/or removal means have a device for initiating a conveying cycle in a 

buffer. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterized in that the device for 
initiating a conveying cycle is constructed in such a way that they initiate 

the same on-approaching a buffer input or buffer output. 
Apparatus according to one of the claims 5 to 8, characterized in that 
the dispenser input and output matrix essentially represent vertical planes 

and that the conveying means and individualizing and combining stations are 
so arranged that the products are supplied from a highest and/or lowest  

 
level to the dispenser and ranges are conveyed away from the dispenser at 

central levels. 
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterized in that the individualizing 
stations and combining stations are palletizing and depalletizing 

stations and that said stations are substantially superimposed. 
Apparatus according to one of the claims 5 to 10, characterized in that 
it also has a warehouse for the intermediate storage of product transportation 

units and range transportation units and conveying means for conveying 
the transportation units to and from the warehouse.
