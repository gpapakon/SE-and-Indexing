<ABSTRACT>
A cut resistant pneumatic tire is provided. The 
tire has a monofilament wire structure embedded in or 

under its tread or sidewall, and is used in off the 
road applications such as mining. The monofilament (22a,22b) 

wire has a diameter of 0.4 to 1.2mm and is made of 
brass plated steel. The wire may be woven or may have 

a spring link configuration. Two monofilament wires 
may be twisted together, and wh
en two such wires are 
used, the total diameter is 0.8 to 1.4mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cut resistant pneumatic 
tires, especially off-the-road tires and heavy duty 
off-the-road tires having typically 1 to 36 carcass 
plies and 6 belts (in a radial ply tire) or 4 breakers 
(in a bias ply tire), and one to four sets of beads. Heavy duty off-the-road tires, because of the 
nature of their use, are exposed to cutting and 
delamination caused by sharp rocks and uneven terrain. 
In the prior art, this problem was sometimes addressed 
by including wire fragments embedded in the rubber of 
the tread and sidewalls of such tires. Although 
shredded wire has been tried to prevent cut growth, it 
does not work well, and may be relatively expensive 
(brass coated wire works best), and is very difficult 
to handle and process into rubber. Shredded wire 
tends to jam the processing equipment and causes 
accelerated wear of the processing equipment. This problem was addressed in EP-A-481913 
by incorporating RFL coated 
monofilament fibers into the tread rubber and sidewall 
rubber of mining tires. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a cut resistant tire, which is easier to 
process and to build than a tire reinforced with 
shredded wire. Other objects of the invention will be apparent 
from the following specification and claims.  
 U.S. Patent 122,249 to Brandenburger relates to a 
tire having a carcass comprising a chained structure 
which interlocks both beads of the tire. The rings of 
the chain are made of spring steel wire and the 
construction is described as being armor or a metallic 
fabric. U.S. Patent 1,143,265 to Gautier relates to 
armoring pneumatic tires, and describes a structure 
similar to a bicycle chain comprising the carcass 
reinforcement of the tire. U.S. Patent 1,201,257 to Cobb relates to a fabric 
for tires in which longitudinal wire cords or 
filaments are interwoven with organic fibers. The 
structure described is used in a crown area of the 
tire as a belt structure. U.S. Patent 1,207,709 to Campbell relates to 
fabric for tires in which wire is interwoven with 
organic cords or fibers in a wire/organic composite 
structure. U.S. Patent 1,228,650 to Christian relates to a 
pneumatic tire in which a woven wire fabric is used in 
the crown area and upper sidewall of the tire. The 
woven wire structure is said to provide resistance 
against perforation, lines 17-18, and blowouts 
resulting from high internal pneumatic pressure, and 
from injury termed "stone bruise", lines 27-30. U.S. Patent 1,236,227 to Stewart relates to an 
armored

<CLAIMS>
A heavy duty pneumatic tire (10) comprising 
at least a pair of parallel annular beads (12), 

carcass plies (14) wrapped around said beads, 
reinforcement plies (21) disposed over said carcass 

plies in a crown area of the tire, a tread (18) 
comprising a tread cap and a tread base (16) disposed 

over said reinforcement plies (21), sidewalls (20) 
disposed between said tread (18) and said beads (12), 

and continuous monofilament wires (22) having a 
diameter of 0.4 to 1.2mm included in or under said 

tread and sidewalls, wherein said monofilament wires 
(22) cover said carcass plies (14) from bead to bead 

and wherein said monofilament wires form an angle of 
10° to 170° with respect to the equatorial plane (EP) 

of the tire. 
The tire of claim 1 wherein said continuous 
monofilament wires (22) are arranged in an armor 

structure. 
The tire of claim 2 wherein said monofilament 
wires (22a) are woven and wires in the weft direction 

have the same diameter as wires in the warp direction. 
The tire of claim 3 wherein said warp and weft 
wires (22a) are fused together at their points of 

intersection. 
The tire of claim 3 or 4 wherein said wires (22a) 
are woven at a density of 12-24 ends per 10 cm (3-6 

epi) in the warp direction and at the same density in 
the weft direction. 
The tire of claim 2 wherein said monofilament 
wires (22b) are coiled into the shape of a spring and  

 
are interwoven with similar wires to provide a linked 

structure. 
The tire of any of claims 1-4 and 6 in which said 
wire (22) has a tensile strength of 1300 MPa to 3500 

MPa, and wherein said steel wire is brass coated and 
has, before incorporation in a wire structure, an 

elongation of 2 to 8%. 
The tire of claim 1 wherein two monofilament 
wires (22) are twisted together and have a total 

diameter of 0.8 to 1.4mm. 
The tire of claim 1 wherein paralell monofilament 
(22) wires are calendered into rubber sheets and 

wherein two to four calendered sheets are placed on 
top of one another in said tire (10). 
The tire of claim 9 wherein a first calendered 
rubber sheet extends from a first bead (12) over a 

first sidewall (20) and a first shoulder (23) of the 
tire and across the crown to a second shoulder of the 

tire, and a second calendered sheet extends from a 
second bead over a second sidewall and said second 

shoulder and across the crown to said first shoulder 
of said tire.
