<ABSTRACT>
A claw for use in a milking system, said claw comprising: a claw bowl member defining a sump having a claw milk line outlet; and a claw body member engageable with or engaged with said claw bowl member to define together with said sump a chamber, said claw body member having four claw milk nipples to allow in use a stream of milk ingress from each respective inlet inwardly into said chamber. The claw is characterised by the claw body member having surface defining means (whether in the form of webs, vanes or otherwise and whether interrelated or otherwise) that in use provide for each stream an (at least partly) inwardly extending surface which in use provides (at least in part) for a locus (e.g. by curving) of substantially non-turbulent milk flow down into the bowl, and/or is characterised by one or both of said claw bowl member and said claw body member including at least one removable weight housed therein but not in communication with said chamber(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in and/or Relating to Milking
Systems and particularly although not solely to a claw for use in such milking systems.It is known to provide within a milking system a milking claw having a claw
bowl member defining a sump having a claw milk line outlet and a claw body
member engageable with or engaged with the claw bowl member to define, together
with the sump, a chamber, the claw body member having four claw milk nipples to
allow a steam of milk ingress into the chamber. Normally such a claw bowl member
and/or the claw body member is associated with a pulsator assembly or unit to
operate the cups to be connected by tubes to the claw milk nipples to operate in at
least one of the modes (i) four and 0, (ii) 2 plus 2 (fore and aft) and (iii) 2 plus 2
(side to side).US Patent Specification 4,537,152 discloses such a claw assembly. A feature
of the claw assembly of US Patent 4,537,152 is its recognition of a desire to reduce
foaming of the milk in the claw because foam, a result of the incorporation of air
into the milk, cause off-flavours and also may render a downstream metering system
inaccurate. The applicant recognises that any turbulent handling of milk in a claw
additionally damages the integrity of the milk and therefore the careful handling than
can arise from the use of a claw assembly as disclosed in US Patent 4,537,152 has the
additional benefit of providing for a collection and despatch of milk through the claw
milk line outlet of a better quality. This is achieved in the claw assembly of US
Patent 4,537,152 by use of a tangential infeed of milk from the claw milk nipples onto
a frusto conical surface.Such prior art claw assemblies that do provide for a careful handling of the
milk have the disadvantage in that there is no prospect of forms providing a real
impediment to cross infecting movement of milk (or any foam that might be created)
from one claw milk nipple to another. EP-A-0,031,246 discloses a milking claw having a
plurality of individual chambers, with a milk inlet
leading from a teat cup into each chamber and an outlet
leading from each chamber to a common chamber in the
milk line. The inlets, outlets and chambers are
positioned and shaped to give a swirling or vortex
action to fluid in the chambers and so that a normal,
direction of flow of fluid from the teat cups to the
milk line cannot be easily reversed thus substantially
preventing back flow of milk to the teat cups and
cross flow of milk between teat cups.The present invention is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A claw for use in a milking system, said
claw comprising:


a claw bowl member (2) defining a sump (15)
having a claw milk line outlet (3) ; and
a claw body member (1) engageable with or engaged
with said claw bowl member (2) to define together with

said sump (15) a chamber, said claw body member (1)
having four claw milk nipples (13) to allow in use a

stream of milk ingress from each respective inlet (13)
inwardly into said chamber, said claw body member (1)

being arranged with the claw milk nipples (13)
directed substantially radially inwardly, and having

surface defining means (7) that in use provide for
each stream an, at least partly, inwardly extending

surface which in use provides, at least in part, for a
locus of substantially non-turbulent milk flow down

into the bowl (2),said surface defining means (7)
partitioning at least partly the upper regions of said

chamber so as to require in use a movement against
gravity if any milk entering the chamber from any claw

milk nipple inlet (13) to the chamber is to contact
any of the other inlets (13), each of the surface

defining means (7) extending downwardly within said
claw bowl member (2).
The claw of claim 1 wherein said claw milk
nipples (13) are directed radially inwardly and

downwardly i.e. with respect to the sump (15) which is
below the claw body member (1).
The claw of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein a
pulsator assembly (10) is positioned either on said

claw body member (1) above the defined chamber or on 
said claw bowl member (2) below said sump (15) and

thus said chamber.
The claw of any one of the preceding claims in
which each surface defining means (7) is spaced

inwardly of said claw bowl member (2) to assist in
cleaning.
The claw of any one of the preceding claims
wherein said surface defining means (7) is in the form

of webs that encourage a spiralling down of the milk
flow with impingement, or such other first contact

therewith, occurring substantially close to the
parallel, i.e. less than 20Â°, on said inwardly

extending surface.
The claw of any one of the preceding claims
wherein, in use, the spiral flow on said surface

defining means (7) continues onto an inwardly facing
surface of the claw body member (1) and/or claw bowl

member (2).
The claw of any one of the preceding claims
wherein, in use, the milk flow in said spiral flow

slows prior to collection in the sump (15) owing to
drag and/or spread.
The claw of any one of the preceding claims
wherein the surface defining means (7) interconnect to

provide distinct surface configurations required for
each claw milk nipple inlet (13), the intersection

providing for the positioning of an interconnection
member to hold a said claw body member (1) to a said

claw bowl member (2). 
The claw of any one of the preceding claims
wherein said claw bowl member (2) is formed in a

transparent plastics material.
The claw of any one of the preceding claims
wherein said claw body member (1) is of a plastics

material.
The claw of any one of the preceding claims
wherein said claw and/or pulsator unit (10) thereof,

if any, includes housed weights (12) capable of being
adjusted by addition or removal to or from a group to

adjust overall weight, said weights (12) not being in
communication with said chamber.
The claw of claim 11 wherein any said housed
weight (12) is housed as a cluster and is only

removable after the removal of a sealing cover.
The claw of claim 12 wherein said cluster of
weights (12) is adapted to be positioned above the

chamber and within said claw body member (1).
A claw body member (1) useful for combining
with a claw bowl member (2) defining a sump and having

a claw milk line outlet (3) so as to provide a claw as
claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
A claw body member as claimed in claim 14
when in conjunction with a pulsating unit (10)

attached thereto.
