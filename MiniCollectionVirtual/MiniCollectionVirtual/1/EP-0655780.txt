<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming an aluminum contact through an 
insulating layer (12) includes the formation of an opening (14). A 

barrier layer (16,18) is formed, if necessary, over the insulating 
layer and in the opening. A thin refractory metal layer is 

then formed over the barrier layer (16,18), and aluminum (26) deposited 
over the refractory metal layer. Proper selection of the 

refractory metal layer and aluminum deposition conditions 
allows the aluminum to flow into the contact and completely 

fill it. Preferably, the aluminum (26) is deposited over the 
refractory metal layer without breaking vacuum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
formation of contacts in integrated circuits, and more
specifically to a method for forming interlevel aluminum
contacts.In semiconductor integrated circuits, formation of
metal interconnect layers is important to the proper
operation of these devices. Metal interconnect signal
lines make contact to lower conductive layers of the
integrated circuit, including the surface of the silicon
substrate, through vias in an insulating layer. For best
operation of the device, the metal used to form the
interconnect layer should completely fill the via.Because of its physical and electrical properties,
aluminum is especially suited for fabrication of metal
interconnect lines in integrated circuits. However, the
sputtering process used to apply aluminum thin film layers
to an integrated circuit generally results in less than
ideal filling of contact vias. Large aluminum grains tend
to form on the upper surface of the insulating layer.
Those grains which form at the edges of the contact via
tend to block it before aluminum has a chance to completely
fill the via. This results in voids and uneven structures
within the via.This problem is especially acute as integrated circuit
devices are fabricated using smaller geometries. The
smaller contacts used in these devices tend to have a
larger aspect ratio (height to width ratio) than larger 
geometry devices, which exacerbates the aluminum filling
problem.The uneven thickness of the aluminum layer going into
the via, caused by the step coverage problem just
described, has an adverse impact on device functionality.
If the voids in the via are large enough, contact
resistance can be significantly higher than desired. In
addition, the thinner regions of the aluminum layer will be
subject to the well known electromigration problem. This
can cause eventual open circuits at the contacts and
failure of the device.Many approaches have been used to try to ensure good
metal contact to lower interconnect levels. For example,
refractory metal layers have been used in conjunction with
the aluminum interconnect layer to improve conduction
through a via. Sloped via sidewalls have been used to
improve metal filling in the via. The use of sloped
sidewalls is becoming less common as device sizes shrink
because the sloped sidewalls consume too much area on a
chip.Even with these techniques, the problems of completely
filling a via with aluminum are not solved. In part this
is because aluminum is deposited at temperatures which tend
to encourage
