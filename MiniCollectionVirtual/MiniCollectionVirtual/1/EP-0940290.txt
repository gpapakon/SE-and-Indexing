Vehicle with a roof grab handle, 
characterized in
that
 the vehicle has a vehicle roof in the form of a
cabriolet roof (2) which can be opened and folded, 
in
that
 the roof grab handle comprises an elastically
deformable handle part (10) which is connected on both

sides to a lateral structure of the cabriolet roof at
handle-part fastening points (8, 9), 
in that
, during
opening, the cabriolet roof (2) can be pushed together

at least between the handle-part fastening points (8,
9) reducing the distance between them, and can be

folded in a roof crossway (14) which runs transversely
with respect to the longitudinal direction of the

vehicle and curves to the outside of the roof, and 
in
that
, during opening of the cabriolet roof (2), the
elastic handle part (10) can be formed by the forced

movement of the handle-part fastening points (8, 9)
towards each other into the folding region of the roof

crossway (14) from an operative position (15) into a
curved inoperative position (16) and can be held there.
Vehicle with a roof grab handle according to
Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the cabriolet roof (2)
has spaced-apart longitudinal linkage parts (6) and/or

crossbars (7) which are connected in an articulated
manner, are connected to at least one fabric web in the

form of a roof skin and are covered, and 
in that
 the
handle-part fastening points (8, 9) are situated on

longitudinal linkage parts (6) and/or on crossbars (7). 
Vehicle with a roof grab handle according to
Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the cabriolet
roof (2) is formed in two layers with an outer skin (4)

and an inner skin (5) and, when the cabriolet roof (2)
is opened, both the outer skin (4) and the inner skin

(5) are folded, and 
in that
 the handle part (10) and
its handle-part fastening points (8, 9) are situated

below the inner skin (5).
Vehicle with a roof grab handle according to one
of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 joints (18, 19,
20), preferably in the form of film hinges, are

provided on the handle-part fastening points (8, 9)
and/or in at least one central region (17) of the

handle part (10).
Vehicle with a roof grab handle according to
Claim 4, 
characterized in that
, when the cabriolet roof
(2) is closed, the distance between the handle-part

fastening points (8, 9) is somewhat smaller than the
extended length of the handle part (10), so that, in

the operative position (15), the handle part (10) has a
bow-shape pointing into the vehicle interior.
Vehicle with a roof grab handle according to
Claim 4 or Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the joints
(18, 19, 20), preferably in the form of film hinges,

and/or the handle part (10) is/are configured by the
provision of preferential directions of deformation in

such a manner that, during opening of the cabriolet
roof (2) and an associated curvature of the handle part

(10), a bow-shape is formed in each case in the
direction of the outside of the roof to provide a

curvature into the folding region of the roof crossways
(14), and 
in that
, during closure of the cabriolet roof
(2), the preferably original bow-shape of the operative

position (15) is re-established. 
Vehicle with a roof grab handle according to one
of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the handle part
(10) is designed in the manner of a flat band, the flat

sides pointing in the direction of curvature.
Vehicle with a roof grab handle according to one
of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the handle part
(10) has a core made of nylon fabric which is encased

in plastic.
