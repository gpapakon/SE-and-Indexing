<ABSTRACT>
Infrared filter discs for passive infrared intrusion detectors have an improved opacity for disturbing light, if they consist of a plastic which is transparent to infrared radiation and contains diamond particles having a particle size from 0.75  mu m to 1.25  mu m at a concentration of a few per cent by weight distributed uniformly therein. The limitation of the region of transparency of the filter discs is further improved if the grain size distribution of the diamond particles is as narrow as possible.

<CLAIMS>
Infrared filter disc for passive infrared intrusion
detectors which have a radiation-impermeable housing with an

entrance port for the radiation and a sensor element which
emits an electrical signal as a function of the intensity of

the impinging radiation, characterized in that the disc
consists of polyethylene with diamond particles with a

particle size from 0.75 µm to 1.25 µm evenly distributed
therein.
Infrared filter disc according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the disc contains diamond particles in a quantity of

0.5 to 5 weight percent, preferably of approx. 1 weight
percent.
Infrared filter disc according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the particle size of the diamond particles is 
<
 2 µm,
preferably 0.5 to 1.25 µm.
Infrared filter disc according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the disc is formed as a thin plane-parallel

plate.
Infrared filter disc according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the disc is formed as an optical element

which comprises at least one Fresnel lens.
Infrared filter disc according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the disc has a surface roughness of

approx. 1 µm.
