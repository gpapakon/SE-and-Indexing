<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to imidazole compounds 
and, more particularly, it relates to imidazole compounds 
exhibiting excellent antibacterial activities - particularly 
high antibacterial activities against microorganisms belonging 
to the genus Helicobacter such as Helicobacter pylori - 
and also to antibacterial agents and antiulcer agents containing 
the same. Antacids, anticholinergic agents, antigastrinic agents, 
gastrointestinal hormones, antipepsinic agents, histamine H₂ 
receptor antagonists, tissue restoring agents, mucous membrane 
protectors, microcirculation improving agents, proton 
pump inhibitors, etc. have been developed as the therapeutic 
agents for ulcers. Therapy of ulcers has become easy as a 
result of developments of histamine H₂ receptor antagonists 
and proton pump inhibitors having particularly strong inhibitory 
effect against an acid secretion among the above-mentioned 
therapeutic agents for ulcers. However, those therapeutic agents for ulcers are with a 
high rate of recurrence of the ulcer after ceasing the 
administration and that has now being left as a big problem  
 
to be solved. Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative microaerophilic 
microorganism belonging to the genus Helicobacter and has been 
suggested to exhibit a possibility of a big cause for the recurrence 
of gastrisis, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, etc. Two combination use of a bismuth preparation and an 
antibiotic or three combination use of a bismuth preparation, 
metronidazole [see, e.g., U. S. Patent No. 2,944,061] 
and tetracycline [see, e.g., U. S. Patent No. 2,712,517] or 
amoxicillin [see, e.g., U. S. Patent No.3,192,198] has been 
currently used as chemotherapy for various diseases caused 
by said Helicobacter pylori. The above-mentioned metronidazole 
is an imidazole derivative having an activity against 
Helicobacter pylori and has been used together with antibiotics. 
Those bismuth preparation, antibiotics and metronidazole 
are administered by an oral route. However, the above-mentioned bismuth preparation, 
antibiotics and metronidazole are to be administered in 
large doses a day for maintaining the concentrations sufficient 
for inhibiting the growth of Helicobacter pylori at 
its growing location. Thus, there are many problems such as 
generation of the adverse reactions such as vomiting and 
diarrhea. Various compounds having an activity against Helicobacter 
pylori have been reported already. For example, 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 5(1993)-117,268,
