<ABSTRACT>
A battery is charged by repeatedly alternating between 
test and charge cycles. During the test cycle, the dynamic 

voltage-current characteristic of the battery is obtained as a 
function of the charge condition of the battery. During the 

charge cycle, a gradually varying voltage is supplied to the 
battery, substantially without controlling the current sup­

plied thereto, for a predetermined time. The rate at which 
this supplied voltage varies is related to the dynamic 

voltage-current characteristic obtained during the test cycle. 
Alternating between test and charge cycles continues until 

the dynamic voltage-current characteristic last obtained is 
substantially identical to the preceding dynamic voltage-­

current characteristic, whereupon the charging of the battery 
is terminated.
