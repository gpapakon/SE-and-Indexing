<ABSTRACT>
An assay for systemic lupus erythematosus based upon capture of the anti-dsDNA portion of IgG in a human serum specimen by the Fc part of a molecule using solid phase immobilized F(ab')2 fragment of anti-human IgG specific for Fc, the captured IgG being then incubated with a synthetic dsDNA tagged with a moiety from which a signal proportional to the quantity of said synthetic dsDNA can be elicited. Upon eliciting a signal from the moiety, the amount of antibody to dsDNA can be quantified, providing diagnostic and prognostic information regarding the disease.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to biochemical assays, and more particularly to assays for
antibodies to double-stranded nucleic acids.Polymeric chains of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), being integral parts of the nuclear
material of biological cells in double-stranded form (dsDNA), do not ordinarily stimulate the
immune system to form antibodies. At least one disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, is
however characterized by apparent abnormalities of the immune system that causes antibodies
to be formed to dsDNA with fatal results. Antibodies to dsDNA occur almost exclusively
in systemic lupus erythematosus and assay for such antibodies is one of the laboratory tests
used in the diagnosis and determination of the prognosis of the disease.Heretofore, measurement of anti-dsDNA antibody has typically been accomplished
by using a radioactive immunoassay in which a complex formed between the antibody and
antigen is labelled with a radioactive material, and a measurement of the radioactivity of the
resulting product is measured as with a Geiger counter, photochemically or the like. The
radioactive materials used in such assays may pose a significant danger, and where they have
limited half-lives, frequent calibration is necessary. Alternatively one can use an enzyme-linked
immunoabsorbent assay employing an enzyme linked to a molecule specific to an
antibody bound to an antigen on a solid phase, e.g. peroxidase phosphate. A chromogenic
substrate is added to generate a colored end product in the presence of the enzyme portion
of the ligand. While such an assay is stable, it is far less sensitive than radioimmunoassays.
Unfortunately also, rheumatoid factors tend to react with the Fc portion of the human IgG
and thus may seriously interfere with the assay.The known Crithidia assay does assay for true dsDNA but, being at best semi-quantitative,
cannot follow the activity of the disease. J. Imm. Methods, 132,91-101,90 (Emlen et al.), discloses a method for
the detection of anti ds-DNA antibodies in serum which comprises the
following steps:
a) binding of biotinylated plasmid ds-DNA on streptavidin-coated wells;b) incubation of the said wells with the sample, whereby any anti ds-DNA
antibody will bind to the solid phase;c) incubation of the solid phase with a goat anti-human IgG labelled with
peroxidase andd) detection of the bound enzyme.A principle object of the present invention is therefore to provide an
assay for anti-dsDNA antibody, which assay is stable, yet highly sensitive,
and uses no materials that pose a

<CLAIMS>
A method of assaying for antibodies to human double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) in a human serum specimen, said method comprising the steps of:


capturing the anti-dsDNA portion of IgG in said human serum
specimen by the Fc part of a molecule using solid phase immobilized F(ab')2

fragment of anti-human IgG specific for Fc;
incubating the captured IgG with synthetic dsDNA tagged with a moiety
from which a signal proportional to the quantity of said synthetic dsDNA can

be elicited;
eliciting said signal; and
quantifying the amount of antibody to dsDNA in accordance with the
elicited signal.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said

captured IgG is incubated with synthetic dsDNA tagged with alkaline
phosphatase, and said elicited signal is proportional to the quantity of alkaline

phosphatase tagging said synthetic dsDNA.
A method as claimed in claim 2 including the step of incubating which
comprises:


adding chemiluminescent substrate to said antibody, and
measuring any resulting luminescence from the reaction of said
substrate with said phosphatase.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said step of capturing is
effected by:


coating animal anti-human IgG antibody onto an inert substrate;
contacting the coated substrate with a dilution of said serum so that a
proportion of the patient IgG becomes bound by reaction with said animal

anti- IgG antibody; and
labelling synthetic double-stranded DNA with digoxigenin and is added
the labelled DNA to said serum to bind to any anti-DNA antibodies which may

be present in the serum.
A method as claimed in claim 4 including the step of incubating which
comprises:


contacting said labelled DNA with an anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled
to alkaline phosphatase.
adding a chemiluminescent substrate to said anti-digoxigenin antibody,
and
measuring any resulting luminescence from the reaction of said
substrate with said phosphatase.
A method as claimed in claim 4 including the further step of comparing
the measurement of said luminescence with predetermined standard levels.
A method as claimed in claim 1 said method comprising the steps of:

forming a first incubation mixture of said specimen and a solid phase
immunoadsorbent having immobilized thereon animal anti-human IgG

antibody including F(ab')2 fragment specific for Fc;
incubating said first mixture under conditions and for a period of time
sufficient for Fc in human IgG in said specimen to become bound by said

F(ab')2 fragment in said animal anti- IgG antibody; 
forming a second incubation mixture of said first mixture and
digoxigenin-labelled synthetic double-stranded DNA under such conditions

and for a period of time sufficient to bind to said immunoadsorbent any anti-DNA
antibodies which may be present in the serum so as to form a double-stranded

DNA antibody complex that has substantially no single stranded or denatured
components;
detecting the amount of digoxigenin labelled synthetic double-stranded
DNA bound to said immunoadsorbent; and
relating the amount of bound labelled synthetic double-stranded DNA
detected to a predetermined quantitative relationship between the amount of

labelled double-stranded DNA and the amount of animal anti-human IgG
antibody to determine the amount of human IgG in said specimen.
