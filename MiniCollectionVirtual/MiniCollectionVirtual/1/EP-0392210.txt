<ABSTRACT>
In a single-crystal growth method disclosed herein, a 
melt is first prepared in a container having a cylindrical 

wall. The container is such that at least the inner 
peripheral surface of the cylindrical wall is formed of a 

material which is not wettable to the melt. A seed is then 
immersed in the melt and a single crystal rod formed on the 

seed is pulled in such a manner as to be coaxial with the 
cylindrical wall. The distance between the single crystal 

rod and the inner peripheral surface is set to a prescribed 
value G, so that the melt adjacent to the inner peripheral 

surface is formed into a prescribed meniscus shape. The 
temperature distribution at the melt surface is controlled to 

maintain the meniscus shape between the single crystal rod 
and the inner peripheral surface at an equilibrium state to 

thereby control the diameter of the single crystal rod.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a single-crystal 
growing method suitable for semiconductor materials such as 
gallium arsenide or silicon and for various metals, utilizing 
a Czochralski process, and in particular, to an improvement 
in preventing the fluctuation of crystal diameter during the 
growing operation. The Czochralski process comprises immersing a seed in 
a melt contained in a crucible and pulling it up to grow a 
single crystal in the form of a cylindrical rod. In this 
method, the configuration of a straight body portion of the 
single crystal must be controlled precisely in order to 
improve the characteristics and yield of crystals. For the configuration control of single crystals of, 
for example, silicon, optical methods such as a fusion ring 
detection method and a light reflection method have hitherto 
been utilized. More specifically, the position of the 
periphery of the solid-liquid interface is optically 
detected, and feedback controls of pulling speed, heater 
temperature, rotational speeds of a pulling shaft and a lower 
shaft which holds the crucible, and so on, are carried out 
based on the detected position to thereby maintain the 
diameter of the straight body portion of the single crystal 
at a constant value. However, in the manufacture of single crystals of  
 
compound semiconductor such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) or 
gallium phosphide (GaP), a Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski 
(LEC) method which involves covering the surface of the melt 
in the crucible with a liquid encapsulant such as B₂O₃ in 
order to prevent the dissociative component from escaping 
from the melt has been extensively used. In this method, the 
aforesaid optical methods cannot be employed because of the 
turbidity of the encapsulant and of flickering due to 
turbulent high pressure gas. Therefore, there has been 
developed a television image method, which uses an X-ray 
transmission device to observe the configuration of the 
solid-liquid interface. However, this method is not suitable 
for mass production and is dangerous due to the use of X-rays. 
There has been also developed a weighing method, which 
involves estimating the crystal diameter based on a crystal 
weight measured by load sensors attached to one or both of 
the pulling shaft and lower shaft of the growing apparatus. 
However, this method has the disadvantage of being inaccurate 
due to the sensitivity limit of the load sensor. Accordingly, there is developed a coracle-type 
pulling technique as a diameter control method suitable
