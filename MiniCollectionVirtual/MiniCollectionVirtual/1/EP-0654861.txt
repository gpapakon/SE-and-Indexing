<ABSTRACT>
A connector for shielded cables comprises a housing 
and signal and ground contacts mounted in said housing, said 

housing having an upper wall with inlet openings for the 
cables. A strain relief member for each cable joins an inlet 

opening, each strain relief member being unitary with the 
upper wall of the housing and projecting from said upper wall, 

wherein the shape of each strain relief member is adapted to 
the outer jacket of the corresponding cable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector for shielded
cables according to the preamble of claim 1.In the known connectors of this type problems occur
with respect to providing a strain relief for the cables
connected to the connector. In a shielded cable, like a
coaxial or twinaxial cable, the impedance of the cable is also
determined by the dielectric lying between the signal conductor and
the shielding. In shielded cables of high quality this
dielectric consists of a relatively soft plastic material so
that deformation of this plastic material easily occurs if
high strain or compressing forces are exerted on the cable.
This deformation results in a change of the impedance which
adversely affects the transmission characteristics of the
cable for high frequency signals.US-A-4 605 276 discloses a connector for shielded
cables according to the preamble of claim 1. In this known
connector a further housing is provided in which the housing
with signal and ground contacts can be inserted together
with two separate strain relief member halves. The strain
relief member halves are held together by a PVC pipe cement
compatible with the outer coating of the cable.The invention aims to provide a connector of the
above-mentioned type, wherein a strain relief is provided in a
simple manner such that deformation of the dielectric plastic
material of the cable can be controlled.To this end the connector according to the invention
is characterized by the characterizing features of claim 1.Thereby, a connector is obtained which is provided
with a strain relief member being unitary with the housing of
the connector and while joining the inlet opening for the
cable extends along a part of this cable, so that the forces
exerted on the cable are distributed along a large surface of
the outer jacket of the cable, whereby deformation of the
dielectric plastic material can be controlled.  The invention will be further explained hereinafter
by reference to the drawings, in which some embodiments of the
connector according to the invention are shown.Fig. 1 schematically shows a perspective view of a
first embodiment of the connector according to the invention
in a partially disassembled position.Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the connector of Fig.
1 in its assembled position.Fig. 3 is a perspective view of three connectors
according to Fig. 2 being plugged into a corresponding
coupling socket.Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a part of the upper
wall of the connector of Fig. 2, wherein for the sake of
clarity the cables are not
