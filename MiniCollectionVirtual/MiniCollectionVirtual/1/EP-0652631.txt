<ABSTRACT>
An AC/DC power supply is connectable to either AC or 
DC and includes a power transformer (PTR) circuit, a rectifier 

circuit, and a switching circuit having first (Q1) and second 
switching devices (Q2) effective when the voltage input is AC 

and DC, respectively, to output pulses to the power 
transformer circuit (PTR). A control circuit (PWMC), when sensing an AC 

voltage input, enables the rectifier to rectify the voltage 
input before applied to the power transformer circuit (PTR), and 

also enables the first switching device (Q1) to output pulses to 
the power transformer circuit (PTR). The control circuit (ISC), when 

sensing a DC voltage input, disables the rectifier and 
enables the second switching (Q2) device to output pulses to the 

power transformer circuit (PTR). A duty-cycle control circuit (PWMC) 
controls both the first (Q1) and second switching devices (Q2) to 

control the duty cycle of the pulses supplied thereby to 
the power transformer (PTR) circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrical power 
supplies, and particularly to electrical power supplies 
which are essentially (but not exclusively) useful for 
certain medical devices, such as respirators, which may be 
connected either to an AC source or a DC source. Power supplies for medical applications, such as 
respirators, require a very high degree of electrical 
safety. Such power supplies must frequently be capable of 
operating from an AC source such as AC household current, 
as well as from a DC source such as a standby battery or an 
automotive vehicle battery. Generally, the two power 
sources are isolated from each other, and/or special 
precautionary controls are provided, to prevent malfunction 
or exposing the user to a dangerous voltage if the two 
sources are plugged in at the same time. In addition, 
users are also generally required to preset the electrical 
device for an AC source or a DC source before turning on 
the device. Failure to properly preset the electrical 
device, which can easily occur, may result in damage to the 
electrical appliance and/or a hazardous condition to the 
user. According to the present invention, there is provided 
an AC/DC power supply, comprising: an input connector for 
connection to a voltage input of either AC or DC; a power 
transformer circuit; a rectifier circuit between the input 
connector and the power transformer circuit; a switching 
circuit including a first switching device effective when  
 
the voltage input is AC to output pulses to the power 
transformer circuit, and a second switching device 
effective when the voltage input is DC to output pulses to 
the power transformer circuit; a control circuit effective, 
when sensing an AC voltage input, to enable the rectifier 
to rectify the voltage input before applied to the power 
transformer circuit, and also to enable the first switching 
device to output pulses to the power transformer circuit; 
the control circuit being effective when sensing a DC 
voltage input, to disable the rectifier and to enable the 
second switching device to output pulses to the power 
transformer circuit; and a duty-cycle control circuit for 
controlling both the first and second switching devices to 
control the duty cycle of the pulses supplied thereby to 
the power transformer circuit. The invention is herein described, by way of example 
only, with reference to the accompanying single drawing 
figure illustrating a preferred circuit constructed in 
accordance with the present invention. The power
