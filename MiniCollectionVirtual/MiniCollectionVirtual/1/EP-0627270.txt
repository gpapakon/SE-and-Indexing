<ABSTRACT>
A dry sorting machine having a separating function for 
removing solids of more than a predetermined size from ash and 

a drying function for drying the ash, and a magnetic sorting 
machine for removing metals from the dried ash are arranged in 

a pretreatment route for the ash to be supplied to the 
furnace. Further, there is provided a drying air pipe for 

introducing the high-temperature air heat-recovered from 
exhaust gases discharged from the ash melting furnace into the 

dry sorting machine. Thus, by the dry sorting machine having 
the separating and drying functions, simplification of the 

ash pretreatment process and reduction of the installation 
space can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ash melting 
arrangement for heating and melting ash discharged from the 
garbage burning furnace or industrial waste burning furnace, 
and a method for supplying the ash to the ash melting furnace, 
with a view to slagging the ash for volume reduction and 
innocuity. The ash discharged from the garbage burning furnace after 
being cooled by cooling water contains a large quantity of 
water together with solids and metals. Therefore, in the 
pretreating unit for the ash, bulky materials are first 
removed from the ash, then solids of diameters larger than a 
predetermined value are separated from the remaining ash and 
the separated solids are crushed by a crusher for further 
separation of new solids resulting from such crushing. 
Further, after the ash removed of the solids is dried and then 
removed of the metals, the ash is supplied to the ash supply 
hopper of the ash melting furnace. The ash supply hopper is 
provided with an ash supply port and an ash pusher at the 
bottom thereof which moves forward and rearward with respect 
to the supply port so that the ash in the supply hopper is 
supplied into the ash melting furnace. The ash pretreating process according to the prior art  
 
technique has had the problem that it is complicated tending 
to cause troubles and the ash supply hopper sometimes becomes 
unable to supply the ash due to the occurrence of a bridge 
phenomenon in the ash and further, the amount of supply of the 
ash to the melting furnace tends to vary. The present invention has for its object to provide an 
ash melting furnace and a method for supplying an ash to the 
melting furnace which can eliminate the above-described prior 
part problems. That is, the ash melting furnace and the method 
according to the present invention makes it possible to 
simplify the ash pretreating unit, prevent the occurrence of 
the bridge phenomenon in the ash in the ash supply hopper and 
supply the ash into the melting furnace in a stabilized state. In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the ash 
melting furnace arrangement according to the present invention 
includes an ash pretreating unit for pretreating an ash 
containing a large quantity of water so as to supply it into a 
melting furnace which is provided with:
 
   a dry sorting machine arranged in an ash pretreating unit 
in which an ash containing a large quantity of water is 
pretreated and supplied to an ash melting furnace and adapted 
to remove solids of a size larger than a predetermined
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An ash melting furnace arrangement including an ash 
pretreating unit for pretreating ash which contains a large 

quantity of water and which is supplied to an ash melting 
furnace, said pretreating unit comprising: 

   a dry sorting machine for removing solids of a size 
larger than a predetermined value from the ash and for drying 

the ash; 
   a magnetic sorting machine for removing metals from the 

ash dried by the dry sorting machine; and 
   a drying air pipe for introducing high-temperature air 

heat-recovered from exhaust gases discharged from the ash 
melting furnace to the dry sorting machine as drying air. 
An ash melting furnace arrangement according to 
Claim 1, wherein the dry sorting machine comprises a vibratory 

frame driven by a vibrator, and a screen having a plurality of 
spaced apart comblike blade plates attached to the vibratory 

frame in a series of cascades. 
An ash melting furnace arrangement according to 
Claim 1, wherein the ash pretreating unit comprises a moisture 

meter for detecting the water content of the ash discharged 
from said dry sorting machine, and a control device for 

operating a drying air adjusting valve interposed in the 
drying air pipe on the basis of a value detected by the 

moisture meter. 
An ash melting furnace arrangement including an ash 
melting furnace comprising an ash supply hopper which is 

 
provided with a slide member movable vertically along the 

inner wall surface of said ash supply hopper and a screen for 
driving said slide member. 
An ash melting furnace arrangement which comprises 
an ash melting furnace, an ash supply hopper, an ash supply 

port for establishing communication between said ash melting 
furnace and said ash supply hopper and an ash pusher having 

a push body movable forward and rearward with respect to the 
ash supply port by the action of a drive mechanism, wherein 

a consolidated passage having a cross section substantially 
equal to that of the push body is extended for a predetermined 

length range from a projecting end to an outlet side of said 
push body. 
An ash melting furnace arrangement according to 
Claim 5, wherein an enlarged passage is formed on the outlet 

side of said consolidation passage in such a manner that the 
sectional configuration of the enlarged passage becomes wider 

toward the ash melting furnace. 
A method of supplying an ash into an ash melting 
furnace characterized in that a push body movable forward and 

rearward with respect to said ash supply port is used to 
supply the ash into the furnace from an ash supply port 

communicating with an ash supply hopper and an ash melting 
furnace in such a manner that the ash within the ash supply 

hopper is pushed into the furnace by a thrust of the push body 
while the ash is being consolidated.
