<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an engine transmission unit (10) for a vehicle with hybrid engine operating in several configurations, wherein a planetary train (12) elements such as a ring gear (14), a sun wheel (16), and a planet pinion cage (18) are linked in rotation with the engine transmission unit (10) such as a shaft (21) of a first electrical machine (22), and an output shaft (30) of a heat engine (20), and a bridge (28) for transmitting engine power to the vehicle wheels (26). The invention is characterised in that it comprises a second electrical machine (40) located between the heat engine (20) output shaft (30) and the planetary train (12) element which is linked in rotation thereto, and control means (MC) capable of combining specific operating modes (I, M, G, A) of the heat engine (20) and the two electrical machines (22, 40) with the operating configurations of the engine transmission unit (10).
