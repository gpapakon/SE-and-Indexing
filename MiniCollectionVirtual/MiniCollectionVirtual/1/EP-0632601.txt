<ABSTRACT>
An echo canceller modem having a fast training 
echo canceller is described. The echo cancellation 

coefficients are computed by taking correlations between 
a complex, periodic training signal sequence and a real 

component of the corresponding echo signal. The modem 
includes a receiver circuit which detects a signal on 

a channel possibly including an echo. An echo canceller 
estimates the real component of the echo signal. 

Training circuitry applies the complex training sequence 
to the channel and takes correlations between the 

training sequence and the real component of the 
corresponding echo signal. In the preferred arrangement, 

the modem also includes a computational element for 
computing the period of the periodic sequence, generating 

the complex periodic training sequence in real time and 
for computing a phase roll frequency based upon the 

computed echo cancellation coefficients.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data communication equipment or
modems provided with echo cancellation features.Data communication equipment (DCEs), or modems, are devices
used to transmit and receive binary data over a communication
channel. One category of DCEs, sometimes referred to as full-duplex
modems, is capable of performing the functions of
transmitting and receiving simultaneously. When the modem is
transmitting and receiving simultaneously over a two-wire
communication link (e.g., transmission over the switched
telephone network), an echo of the transmitted signal is commonly
present in the signal received from the remote modem. If the
transmitted and received signals occupy the same frequency band,
it is necessary to remove the echo signal, in order to reliably
detect the data sent by the remote modem.The echo signal typically has a near echo and a far echo
component. The near echo is generated by the imperfect hybrid
couplers in the local modem and the near-end telephone central
office. The far echo, on the other hand, is mainly generated by
the hybrid couplers in the remote central office and the remote
modem. The far echo is delayed in time relative to the near
echo. When this delay can be substantial, the echo canceller is
often broken into a near-echo and a far-echo canceller component
which are also separated by a delay.High-speed modems typically use bandwidth-efficient 
modulation schemes such as quadrature modulation. In such
systems, the binary data is first mapped into a sequence of
complex signal points (symbols) chosen from a constellation with
a finite number of points. The real-valued transmitted signal
carries information about this complex sequence.Two-wire, full-duplex, high-speed modems, such as the
standard V.32 voiceband modem specified by the CCITT, come
equipped with adaptive echo cancellers which are capable of
nearly eliminating the echoes of the transmitted signal. An echo
canceller is typically implemented as a transversal filter which
consists of a tapped-delay line, and a series of variable
complex-valued tap coefficients. The inputs to the tapped-delay
line are the aforementioned complex signal points. These are
appropriately weighted by the tap coefficients to generate as
output the real part of the weighted running sum. This
represents an approximation of the received real-valued echo
signal. The echoes are cancelled by subtracting this estimated
echo signal from the real received signal.Echo cancellers which are implemented as a transversal
filter with a
