<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the structure and operation of centrifugal clutches. The art of centrifugal clutches of the type and/or class here concerned 
with is old and highly developed. While the details of construction of prior art clutches varies widely, the 
basic mechanical aspects and functions of such clutches has been substantially 
standardized. The basic structure and mechanics that characterize prior art clutches 
includes an elongate central rotary power input shaft with front and rear ends and 
a plurality of axially spaced plates in rotary driving engagement about the shaft with 
the rearmost plate in fixed axial position on the shaft and the remainder of the plates 
being shiftable axially of the shaft; an elongate rotary power output part is engaged 
about the shaft and the plates; a plurality of axially spaced disks in rotary driving 
engagement and shiftable axially of the drive part are interengaged between the 
plates. The clutches are next provided with actuating means to normally yieldingly 
urge and hold the interengaged plates and disks out of frictional rotary driving 
engagement with each other when the clutch rotates at a low rate and to urge the  
 
plates and disks into driving frictional engagement with each other as the rate of 
rotation of the clutch is increased. The prior art actuating means include a large 
heavy flange-like carrier part carried by the shaft and spaced axially forward of the 
front plate; a plurality of circumferentially spaced spring means carried by the carrier 
part and coupled with the front plate to normally yielding urge that plate forward; 
and, a plurality of circumferentially spaced normally forwardly extending actuating 
weights pivotally carried by the carrier part on axes normal to radial planes on which 
the weights are positioned; and, normally radially outwardly and axially rearwardly 
projecting cam arms on the weights engaging a front surface of the front plate and 
operating to move that plate rearwardly, against the resistance of the spring means 
and to urge the several plates and disks into frictional driving engagement with each 
other and cause the output part to rotate with the shaft. The above-noted basic prior art centrifugal clutch structure is shown in 
Figs. 12 and 13 of the accompanying drawings. Two notable prior art embodiments of the above prior art clutch 
structures are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,291,274, issued December 13, 1966 
to R.M. Wyman and entitled "Centrifugal Clutch"; and U.S. Patent No. 4,111,291,
