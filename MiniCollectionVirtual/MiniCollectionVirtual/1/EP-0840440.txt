<ABSTRACT>
The control circuit for an inductive load, such as for adjusting the speed of a permanent magnet DC motor, has a direct voltage source comprising an uncontrolled rectifier followed by a smoothing condenser. A simulation circuit is provided for the voltage at the inductive load and a pulse width modulator whose inputs are subject on one hand to a control voltage corresponding to a set point and on the other hand to the voltage from the DC source dropped through a voltage divider. A voltage from a reference voltage source is also fed to the pulse width modulator. The output voltage of the modulator is used for this. The modulator comprises a comparator with hysteresis or a Schmidt Trigger.
