<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biaxially
oriented polyester film. More particularly, the
present invention relates to a biaxially oriented
polyester film which contains crosslinked polymer
particles having a particular particle size
distribution ratio, a particular average particle
diameter and a particular shape and which has a flat
film surface having a small number of large
protuberances, excellent running property and
excellent winding property.Biaxially oriented polyester films are in
wide use in various applications such as magnetic tape,
electric appliances, photographs, metallization,
packaging and the like, owing to their excellent
properties. Owing particularly to their high strength
and elastic modulus, they are in wide use as a base
film for a video tape, an audio tape, a computer tape,
a floppy disk, etc.With increasing demands for high-density
recording and high quality in these application fields
in recent years, a polyester film used as a base film
is increasingly required to have flat surface(s) while
retaining running property.In order to improve the running property of a
film, inert inorganic particles are added to a polyester
to form fine protuberances derived from the
particles on the film surface at the time of film
formation. Inert inorganic particles usually have a
wide particle size distribution and contain coarse
particles and must, therefore, be subjected to classification
to remove the coarse particles, before the
addition to the polyester. This classification,
however, incurs increase in production costs, and the 
cost drastically increases as the classification is
made to a higher degree). Moreover, the classification
has a limit in narrowing the particle size distribution
and it is unable to remove the coarse particles
completely.Hence, researches have been made in recent
years on industrial production of particles,
particularly crosslinked polymer particles, containing
no coarse particles and having uniform particle
diameters, and some of such particles are in industrial
production. These particles, however, have a
relatively large average particle diameter. Production
of particles having uniform and smaller particle
diameters involves problems to be solved and requires a
higher production cost.The research by the present inventors
revealed that in producing a biaxially oriented
polyester film of flat surface using the above-mentioned
inorganic particles or crosslinked polymer
particles, the running property of a film can be
increased to a certain degree but the film
