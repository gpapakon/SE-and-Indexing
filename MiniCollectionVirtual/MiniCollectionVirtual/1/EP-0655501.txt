<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to HIV D205 a HIV-2 virus
variant that may be cloned from the corresponding virus isolate
HIV D205 (ECACC V 87122304)."Molecular cloning of two West African human immunodeficiency
virus type 2 isolates which replicate well on macrophages:
a Gambian isolate from a case of neurologic aquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, and a highly divergent Ghanesian
isolate" (Kühnel, H., v. Briesen, H., Dietrich, U., Adamski,
M., Mix, D., Biesert, L. Kreutz, R., Immelmann, A., Henco, K.,
Meichsner, Ch., Andreesen, R., Gelderblom, H. & Rübsamen-Waigmann,
H., 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 86, 4, 2383-2387.In diagnostics, two criteria are demanded to be met, namely
specifity and sensitivity for the antigen to be detected. In
the diagnostics of AIDS the demand for specifity can certainly
be complied with by using the isolates HTLV-IIIB and LAV-2
(Guyader, M. et al., "Nature" 326, 1987, 662-669) in order to
delimit HIV infections from other infections and, thus, to make
a rough assignment into the classes of "HIV-2-related infections"
or "HIV-1-related infections". However, a problem is
constituted by the sensitivity of the diagnosis. In the range
of the so-called seroconversion, i.e. the initial occurrence
of the antibody in the infected person, a reduction in sensitivity
implies an increase in the number of "falsely negative"
test results. Accordingly, it is one main goal to shorten the
period between an infection and the detectability of this
infection as much as possible by improving the test sensitivity. A decreased cross reactivity, in the practice of the widely
employed ELISA diagnostics, is manifested, for example, in a
reduced sensitivity. Thus, the use of the described HIV-1
isolate means about an average reduction of the test sensitivity
against HIV-2 sera by the factor of 100 to 1000, whereas the
isolate HTLV-IIIB enables almost no detection to be accomplished
anymore.A disastrous principle of the diseases caused by HIV
resides in the fact that there is not only one type of each of
HIV-1 and HIV-2 virus phenotypes and genotypes. What is to be
premised is rather a large group of related viruses, possible
even populations which by no way are strictly separated from
each other but continuously penetrate one another and undergo
some evolutionary development to a more and more increasing
divergence, while at the same time they begin by recombination
events to exchange between each other parts of the genom. Thus,
the existing HIV species form a broad continuous population
level in which
