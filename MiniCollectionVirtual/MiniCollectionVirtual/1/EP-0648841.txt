<ABSTRACT>
Genomic DNA of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and a minigene are disclosed. The 
minigene is used for making a transgenic animal that produces functionally active 

cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase and functions as a disease model. A cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 
promoter region and reporter gene construct is provided, as well as a 

transgenic animal that expresses the promoter/reporter gene.

<DESCRIPTION>
High serum cholesterol is commonly associated with an increased risk of heart 
attack, atherosclerosis and circulatory disorders. In addition, a variety of diseases 
are caused by disorders of cholesterol catabolism, such as gallstone disease, 
atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia and some lipid storage diseases. The major pathway for disposal of cholesterol in the body is by secretion of 
cholesterol and bile acids into the gut. Bile contains free cholesterol and bile acids. 
The enzyme, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7), commits cholesterol to bile acid 
synthesis and catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis in the 
liver. Thus, by increasing synthesis of bile acids, this enzyme plays a key role in 
the liver by depleting hepatic cholesterol pools, resulting in increased LDL uptake 
and a lowering of serum cholesterol levels. Bile acids are physiological agents which are important in the solubilization of lipid-soluble 
vitamins, sterol and xenobiotics. Bile acids are synthesized exclusively in 
the liver and are secreted to the intestines where they are modified to secondary 
bile acids. Most bile acids are reabsorbed in the ileum and recirculated to the 
hepatocytes via the portal vein. The feedback of bile into the liver is known to inhibit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 
and thus inhibit the overall rate of bile acid synthesis. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 
therefore has been a subject of intense investigations to elucidate the regulatory 
mechanisms of bile acid synthesis in the liver.  
 It is known that an interruption of bile acid reabsorption, such as that caused by 
the bile sequestrant, cholestyramine, or by a bile fistula, stimulates the rate of bile 
acid synthesis and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the liver. It is believed 
that cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the liver is regulated primarily at the 
gene transcriptional level by bile acids, cholesterol, hormones, diurnal rhythm and 
other factors. Generally, the regulation of eukaryotic genes is thought to occur at several 
locations, including the promoter sequences, which are located upstream of the 
transcription start site; enhancer or repressor sequences, which are located 
upstream of the promoter; within intron sequences, which are non-coding 
sequences located between exons or coding sequence; and in 3' sequences, which 
are located downstream from the coding region. The promoter sequence is unique 
to each gene and is required for the accurate and efficient initiation of gene 
transcription.
