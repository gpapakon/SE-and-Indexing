<ABSTRACT>
Constitution: a novel compound represented by general formula 
(1), wherein R¹ represents -OR³ (R³ being H or alkyl), -NR⁴R⁵ (R⁴ and 

R⁵ being each H, alkyl or alkoxy), -NHCH(R⁶)COR⁷ (R⁶ being H or 
alkyl, and R⁷ being alkyl), -NHCH(R⁶)COOR⁸(R⁸ being alkyl) or 

-NHCH(R⁶)CONR⁹R¹⁰ (R⁹ and R¹⁰ being each H or alkyl, or alternatively 
NR⁹R¹⁰ being a heterocyclic group as a whole); and R² represents 

H, alkyl or aralkyl. Effect: since the compound has an inhibitory 
activity type IV collagenase, it is useful as an inhibitor against vascularization,

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel piperazinecarboxylic
acid derivatives having excellent collagenase
inhibiting activity.Collagenase degrades collagen, which is one of the
main components of the connective tissues. Of the
collagenases, type IV collagenases degrade type IV
collagen, which is a main component of the basement
membranes. It is known that the activity of type IV
collagenases is raised at the time of angiogenesis
accompanied by cancer growth and at the time of cancer
invasion and metastasis, and that these enzymes play an
important role in the degradation of the basement
membranes [William G. Stetler-Stevenson; Cancer and
Metastasis Reviews, Vol. 9, 289-303 (1990)].
Accordingly, a collagenase inhibitor may be useful for
the prevention and treatment of these diseases.Hitherto, there have been reports concerning low
molecular weight substances showing collagenase
inhibiting effects, including peptide compounds
containing a mercapto group [Robert D. Gray, Hossain H.
Saneii and Arno F. Spatola: Biochemical and Biophysical
Research Communications, Vol. 101, No. 4, 1251-1258
(1981); Charles F. Vencill, David Rasnick, Katherine V.
Crumley, Norikazu Nishino and James C. Powers:
Biochemistry, Vol. 24, 3149-3157 (1985)]; peptide
compounds containing a carboxyl group [Jean-Marie
Delaisse, Yves Eeckhout, Christopher Sear, Alan 
Galloway, Keith McCullagh and Gilbert Vaes: Biochemical
and Biophysical Research Communications Vol. 133,
483-490 (1985)]; benzyloxycarbonyl propyl-leucyl-glycylhydroxamic
acid [William M. Moore and Curtis A.
Spilburg: Biochemical and Biophysical Research
Communications, Vol. 136, 390-395 (1986)]; and
hydroxylamine derivatives (Japanese Patent Kokai
Application Hei No. 1-160997). Furthermore, SC 44463
has been reported [Reuven Reich, Erik W. Thompson,
Yukihide Iwamoto, George R. Martin, James R. Deason,
George C. Fuller and Ruth Miskin: Cancer Research, Vol.
48, 3307-3312 (1988)] as an inhibitor relatively
specific to type IV collagenases. SC 44463 has been
confirmed to exhibit an inhibitory activity on cancer
metastasis in an animal experiment. The above
compounds, however, are synthetic ones and are not yet
put to practical use.On the other hand, the tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase (TIMP) and related substances are
known as collagenase inhibitors of the protein type. It
becomes possible to prepare TIMP on a large scale by
recombinant DNA technology, but it has not yet been put
to practical use [A. J. P. Docherty, A. Lyons, B. J.
Smith, E. M. Wright, P. E. Stephens, T.
