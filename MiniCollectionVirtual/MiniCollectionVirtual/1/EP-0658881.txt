<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic head provided with a 
transducing element (23) and at least one flux-guiding element (17a, 17b). An 

electrically conducting layer (8) of a non-magnetic material and a second electrically 
insulating layer (9) of a non-magnetic material are successively formed on a first 

electrically insulating layer (5) of a non-magnetic material. The second electrically 
insulating layer is subsequently provided with at least an interruption exposing a portion 

of the electrically conducting layer. Subsequently, the flux-guiding element is formed by 
electrodepositing a soft-magnetic material on said portion until the interruption is filled, 

whereby the flux-guiding element and the second electrically insulating layer constitute 

an at least substantially plane surface on which an electrically insulating spacer layer 
(21) is formed. Subsequently, the transducing element is provided on the spacer layer. 

The magnetic head thus formed has a non-magnetic transducing gap (35) terminating in 
a head face (33) and being constituted by the first electrically insulating layer (5) and 

the electrically conducting layer (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic
head provided with a transducing element and at least one flux-guiding element, which
method starts from a substrate.A method of manufacturing a thin-film magnetic head is known from EP-A
0 516 022. The magnetic head obtained by
means of this known method is an integrated magnetic head provided with a contact
face and comprising an inductive part and a magnetoresistive part. In accordance with
the known method, two flux guides of an amorphous material based on Co are provided
on a non-magnetic substrate, while an aperture present between the two flux guides is
filled with a first insulation layer of SiO2. The surface formed by the flux guides and
the first insulation layer is provided with a second structured insulation layer on which
subsequently a magnetoresistive (MR) element is formed. The MR element is then
coated with a third structured insulation layer on which subsequently a bias winding is
formed. To coat the bias winding, a fourth structured insulation layer is then provided.
Subsequently, a magnetic core layer of a Co-based material is formed, which layer is in
contact with one of the flux guides via apertures in the three last-mentioned insulation
layers. The areas which are not coated by the core layer are filled with a filling layer of
Al2O3, whereafter a surface on which an inductive element is formed is obtained by a
mechanical operation.The known method comprises a relatively large number of process steps
for manufacturing at least the magnetoresistive part of the magnetic head. Moreover,
there is a great risk of irregularities in the surface formed by the flux guides and the
first insulation layer, necessitating the use of a relatively thick second insulation layer in
order to ensure a reliable electrical insulation between the MR element and the flux
guides. However, such an insulation layer has a negative influence on the efficiency of
the magnetic head.It is an object of the invention to provide a method of manufacturing a 
reliable and efficient thin-film magnetic head provided with a transducing element and
at least one flux-guiding element, requiring only a small number of steps.To this end the method according to the invention is characterized in that
an electrically conducting layer of a non-magnetic material and a second electrically
insulating layer of a non-magnetic material are successively formed on a first
electrically insulating layer of a non-magnetic material, said second electrically
insulating
