<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an encoder with high spatial resolution 
for positioning and/or speed determinations in rotational or linear 
movements (rotations or translations). More specifically, this 
invention relates to an encoder whereby in an encoder element binary 
information has been inputted that can be read by means of laser 
techniques. Encoders make use of signals, mostly electric signals, that are 
representative for the position of a moving object. Hereby pulses 
are generated whose number is a measure for the distance traversed 
by the object, and being expressed in angular units or in distance 
units.
 
Encoders of that kind constitute an important link between the 
mechanics of an apparatus or a machine on the one hand and its 
controlling electronics on the other hand. In principle such an encoder is always based on scanning a fine and 
regularly divided grid on a graduated element, which functions as a 
measuring standard and is called "encoder element" in the following. 
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an encoder for a rotation, said 
encoder element 1 having a circular shape. Fig. 2 is a schematic 
diagram of an encoder for a translation (whose direction is 
symbolised by the letter t), said encoder element 1 having an 
elongated shape. Further, such an encoder contains a transmitter 2 
such as, e.g., a light source, a receiver or recorder 3 such as, 
e.g., a light sensor and optionally processing electronics such as, 
e.g., a trigger and/or a counter (for clarity's sake not represented 
separately in a drawing). A succinct overview of known encoder techniques is given, e.g., in 
"Die Grundlagen der Ingenieurwissenschaften", Huette, 29. Auflage, 
1989, Springer Verlag (p. H23 and H24), comprising translational or 
linear encoders as well as rotational encoders ("Weg- und Winkel-aufnehmer"), 
containing conductive, inductive, magnetic as well as  
 
optical scanning, and comprising both incremental and absolute 
encoders. Generally, encoders of that kind have a spatial resolution that is 
mainly limited by the addressability or the intrinsic resolution of 
the encoder element.
 
In resistive encoder elements, often used in analogue controlling 
systems, wire-wound resistors suffer from a rather low resolution, 
whereas non-wire-wound, potentiometric resistors in addition thereto 
suffer from wear at their contact surfaces and from electrical 
noise.
