<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an aqueous cleaning composition which is 

useful for the removal of grease or tar without any mechanical action. In particular, the 
instant compositions are derived from three liquid phases which merge together at the 

tricritical point to form one continuum forming the aqueous cleaning composition, 
wherein the three phases incorporate at least a polar solvent, a non-polar solvent or 

weakly polar solvent and a water soluble or water low molecular weight water 
dispersible amphiphile.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous, cleaning composition which is 
optionally surfactant-free and is useful for the removal of grease or tar without any 
mechanical action. In particular, the instant compositions comprise three liquid 
phases which merge together in the vicinity of a tricritical point to form one continuum, 
wherein each of the three phases essentially contain a polar solvent, a non-polar 
solvent or a weakly polar solvent and a water soluble or water dispersible low 
molecular weight amphiphile. Liquid aqueous synthetic organic detergent compositions have long been 
employed for human hair shampoos and as dishwashing detergents for hand washing 
of dishes (as distinguished from automatic dishwashing, machine washing of dishes). 
Liquid detergent compositions have also been employed as hard surface cleaners, as 
in pine oil liquids, for cleaning floors and walls. More recently, they have proved 
successful as laundry detergents too, apparently because they are convenient to use, 
are instantly soluble in wash water, and may be employed in "pre-spotting" 
applications to facilitate removal of soils and stains from laundry upon subsequent 
washing. Liquid detergent compositions have comprised anionic, cationic and 
nonionic surface active agents, builders and adjuvants including, as adjuvants, 
lipophilic materials which can act as solvents for lipophilic soils and stains. The 
various liquid aqueous synthetic organic detergent compositions mentioned above 
serve to emulsify lipophilic materials including oily soils in aqueous media, such as 
wash water, by forming micellar dispersions and emulsions. A cleaning action can be regarded as a more-or-less complex process resulting 
in the removal of soils from a given surface. The driving forces generally involved in 
this process are mechanical energy (friction, attrition, sonification, etc.), solvation by a 
liquid, thermal agitation, soil-solvent interfacial tension reduction, chemical 
modifications (caustic, acidic, oxidative, reductive, hydrolysis, assisted or not by  
 
catalysts or enzymes), soil or soil residual suspension (e.g. in micellar solutions), and 
so on. When the cleaning action takes place in water liquid vehicle, auxiliary cleaning 
agents, especially surfactants, are generally required to get rid of hydrophobic soils. 
Moreover, in most domestic cleaning tasks, the success of the cleaning mechanism is 
based on the reduction of the water/oil interfacial tension. The generally admitted 
theory is that the oily
