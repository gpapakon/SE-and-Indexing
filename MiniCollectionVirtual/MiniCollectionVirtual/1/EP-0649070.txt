<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
forming apparatus, more particularly to such an
apparatus in which a speed of an image bearing member
or a recording material carrying member is changeable,
further particularly to a color image forming
apparatus in which images are superposedly transferred
onto a recording material from an image bearing
member.A multi-color image forming apparatus is
known as disclosed in German Patent Publication No.
2607727 or Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
50935/1975. When a color image is formed on a
transparent resin sheet for an overhead projector (OHP
sheet) in the conventional multi-color image forming
apparatus, the light transmission is required for the
print. This is because, in the case of the overhead
projector, the light transmitted through the print is
projected, and therefore, if the transparency is poor,
the projected image is dark (blackish) even to the
worst extent that the image is projected as black and
white image.In order to assure the transparency, it is
desired that in the fixing step after the transfer of
the toner onto the recording material from the image 
bearing member, a sufficient amount of sheet is
applied to the developer to smooth the surface of the
developer after the image fixing. However, it is
difficult to increase the fixing temperature because of
the sheet durability and service life of the image
fixing apparatus. Therefore, in the apparatus used
recently, the distance from a position where the
transfer material is separated from a transfer drum
for carrying the recording material or transfer
material to the fixing position is made longer than
the length of the transfer material, and when the
sheet for the overhead projector (OHP) sheet is used,
the transfer material feeding speed is reduced in the
path after the separation of the transfer material
from the transfer drum to the fixing station, without
changing the image formation speed excepts for the
fixing station, and sufficient heat is applied
during the fixing operation.According to this method, sufficient heat
can be applied during the fixing operation without
changing the process speed except for the sheet
feeding and the fixing operation after the sheet
separation, that is, without influence to the latent
image formation and the developing process involving
the photosensitive member. Therefore, an OHP print
having good transparency can be provided without
influence to the image bearing member (photosensitive 
member) or the developing operation therefor. In this
example
