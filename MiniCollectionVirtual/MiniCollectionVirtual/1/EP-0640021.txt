<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a universal turret system according to the pre-characterizing
part of claim 1 and as known from US-A-2,534,333. More
particularly the invention relates to
to turret systems having
quick-change lathe tooling.
The invention relates furthermore to a method for accomodating a full range of tools on
a universal turret system.In the past, turret disk systems have been
designed to generally accommodate limited types or
classes of tooling. For example, it is common to find
turret systems that will accommodate conventional or
manual tooling such as a shank-type tool holder but
incapable of accommodating semi or fully automatic
tools or a live or driven tools. The result of this is
that tool builders and end users find themselves locked
into a position where they have no flexibility in
implementing a standardized flexible quick-change
tooling system. This point is illustrated by the fact
that an end user can purchase a turret system that has
the limited capability of accommodating only one or two
classes of quick-change tooling and which is unable to
accommodate more advanced and sophisticated quick-change
tooling such as those classes of tools typically
referred to as semi or fully automatic quick-change
tooling and live or driven tooling. In time, the same
end user will often find himself in a position where it
is desirable to utilize these more advanced and
sophisticated quick-change tools but because of the
design and limited flexibility of the turret system, 
the end user is placed in a position where he has but
one alternative, that alternative being to purchase a
new turret system designed specifically to accommodate
the desired class of tooling.Moreover, conventional turret systems have
not been adapted to enhance machine and operator
efficiency, reduce cost or improve productivity. For
example, in conventional turret disk systems, it is not
unusual to find efficiency as low as twenty percent
with the operator spending as much as sixty percent of
his time setting up the turret system and with the
remaining twenty percent being divided between idle and
stop time.US-A-2,534,333 entitled "Turret" teaches a turret disk which supports
a plurality of tool holders 22 that receive various types of tools. Thus, there is a need for a turret disk
system which facilitates tools standardization and tool
management by enhancing machine flexibility. In this
same regard, there is a need for a turret disk system
that will accommodate a wide range of tool classes
including manual tools,
