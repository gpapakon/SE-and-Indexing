<ABSTRACT>
A method (602-632) and apparatus (700) for adaptively reconfiguring a neighbor cell list. For a selected cell of a cellular system, data associated with the selected cell and each of a plurality of neighboring base stations is collected (604, 616). The collected data includes data on events indicative of the quality of hand offs from the selected cell to each of the neighboring base stations. The collected data also includes signal level measurements made on measurement channels of the neighboring base stations. A plurality of quality values, each associated with the selected cell and one of the neighboring cells, are then determined (626) from the collected data. A neighbor cell list is then generated (628) for the selected cell by determining the highest quality values, and placing the hand off measurement channels of the neighboring cells associated with the highest quality values in the neighbor cell list.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ADAPTIVE NEIGHBOR CELL LISTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/512,449 entitled "NEIGHBOR CELL LIST CREATION AND VERIFICATION IN A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM", filed on August 8, 1995. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to mobile telecommunications systems, and more particularly, to a method and system for building a neighbor cell measurement channel list for mobile station handoff.History of the Prior ArtIn a cellular mobile telecommunications system, the user of a mobile station communicates with the system through a radio interface while moving about the geographic coverage area of the system. The radio interface between the mobile station and system is implemented by providing base stations dispersed* throughout the coverage area of the system, each capable of radio communication with the mobile stations operating within the system. In a typical mobile telecommunications system each base station of the system controls communications within a certain geographic coverage area ideally represented by a hexagonal shape termed a cell, and a mobile station which is located within a particular cell communicates with the base station controlling that cell. When a call is initiated by the user of a mobile station, or received at the system for a mobile station, the call is set up on radio channels assigned to the base station controlling the cell in which the mobile station 

 is located. If the mobile station moves away from the original cell in which the call was set up and the signal strength on the radio channels of the original cell weakens, the system will affect transfer of the call to radio channels of a base station controlling a neighboring cell into which the mobile station moves. As the mobile station user continues to move throughout the system, control of the call may be transferred from the neighboring cell to another cell. This transfer of the call from cell to cell is termed handover or handoff.Handoff can only be effective if the call isâ€¢ transferred to radio channels that provide adequate signal strength for two way communications. This requires sufficient signal strength at both the receiver of the mobile station and receiver of the base station to which handoff is made. The signals must also be sufficiently strong in relation to any noise or interference that is present in the network. For effective handoff it is necessary that some sort of signal strength or interference level measurement process
