<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to benzodiazepine
compounds which are useful as antagonists of
cholecystokinin and gastrin receptors.Cholecystokinins (CCK) and gastrin are
structurally related peptides which exist in
gastrointestinal tissue and in the central nervous system
(see, V. Mutt, Gastrointestinal Hormones, G.B.J. Green,
Ed., Raven Press, N.Y., p.169 and G. Nission, ibid.
p.127).Cholecystokinins include CCK-33, a neuropeptide
of thirty-three amino acids in its originally isolated
form (see, Mutt and Jorpes, Biochem. J. 125, 678 (1971)),
its carboxylterminal octapeptide, CCK-8 (also a
naturally-occurring neuropeptide and the minimum fully
active sequence), and 39- and 12-amino acid forms.
Gastrin occurs in 34-, 17- and 14-amino acid forms, with
the minimum active sequence being the C-terminal
tetrapeptide, Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2, which is the common
structural element shared by both CCK and gastrin.CCKs are believed to be physiological satiety
hormones, thereby possibly playing an important role in
appetite regulation (G. P. Smith, Eating and Its
Disorders, A. J. Stunkard and E. Stellar, Eds, Raven
Press, New York, 1984, p. 67), as well as stimulating
colonic motility, gall bladder contraction, pancreatic
enzyme secretion and inhibiting gastric emptying. They
reportedly co-exist with dopamine in certain mid-brain
neurons and thus may also play a role in the functioning
of dopaminergic systems in the brain, in addition to
serving as neurotransmitters in their own right (see A.
J. Prange et al., "Peptides in the Central Nervous 
System", Ann. Repts. Med. Chem 17, 31, 33 [1982] and
references cited therein; J. A. Williams, Biomed Res. 3
107 [1982]; and J.E. Morley, Life Sci. 30, 479 [1982]).The primary role of gastrin, on the other hand,
appears to be stimulation of the secretion of water and
electrolytes from the stomach and, as such, is involved
in control of gastric acid and pepsin secretion. Other
physiological effects of gastrin then include increased
mucosal blood flow and increased antral motility. Rat
studies have shown that gastrin has a positive trophic
effect on the gastric mucosa, as evidenced by increased
DNA, RNA and protein synthesis.There are at least two subtypes of
cholecystokinin receptors termed CCK-A and CCK-B (T.H.
Moran etal., "Two brain cholecystokinin receptors:
implications for behavioural actions", BrainRes., 362,
175-79 [1986]). Both subtypes are found both in the
periphery and in the central nervous system.CCK and gastrin receptor antagonists have been
disclosed for preventing and
