<ABSTRACT>
A combination of an adjusting shim and a cam 
used in a valve train in an internal combustion engine 

for automobiles, the adjusting shim composed of a 
ceramic material which sets the surface roughness of a 

sliding surface of the adjusting shim with respect to 
a cam to not more than 0.1 µm in ten-point mean 

roughness Rz, and which contains not less than 60 
vol.% of silicon nitride or sialon, and the cam 

composed of cast iron a surface of which is chill 
hardened and then provided with a phosphate film 

thereon. The combination of an adjusting shim and a 
cam is capable of smoothing a sliding surface of the 

cam by the break-in of the part even if the cam is not 
subjected to a super-precision finishing process; 

preventing the seizure and abnormal abrasion of 
sliding surfaces; stabilizing a smoothed condition of 

the sliding surfaces of the cam and shim for a long 
period of time; and providing excellent sliding 

characteristics of the sliding surfaces owing to a 
decrease in the friction coefficient thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination 
of a cam and an adjusting shim used in a valve 
train in an internal combustion engine for 
automobiles. In recent years, it has been strongly demanded 
that the fuel consumption of an automobile engine be 
improved by increasing the efficiency of the engine, 
and the reducing of a friction loss of an internal 
combustion engine has been studied as one of effective 
measures for solving this problem. It is said to be 
very effective to reduce the abrasion of contact 
surfaces of, especially, a cam and an adjusting shim 
in a valve train which are some of such sliding parts 
of an internal combustion engine, such as an 
automobile engine that are used under the severest 
conditions due to their low sliding speed and high 
load. The adjusting shim is a part for regulating a 
valve clearance, and has heretofore been formed out of 
a metal just as the cam. It is generally said that a minimum clearance or 
a minimum thickness of an oil film between opposed 
sliding parts and the properties of sliding surfaces 
of the sliding parts have a great influence on the 
sliding characteristics thereof. As shown in, for 
example, "Hydraulic Pressure and Air Pressure" Vol.  
 
18, No. 4, 1987, pages 247-258, and "Collection of 
Unprinted Theses Made Public in Scientific Lecture 
Meeting 924" edited by Society of Automobile 
Techniques, 1992, pages 85-88, an oil film parameter Λ 
defined by the following equation 1 is used frequently 
as a value representing the measure of lubrication 
condition. 
[Equation 1]   Λ=hmin/σ=hmin/(Rrms12+Rrms22)1/2 
wherein 
hmin is a minimum clearance or a minimum 
thickness of an oil film between opposed sliding 
parts, σ is a composite surface roughness of opposed 
sliding parts, Rrms1 is a roughness-root-mean square of a 
surface of one sliding part, and Rrms2 is a roughness-root-mean square of a 
surface of the other sliding part. It is said that values of this oil film 
parameter Λ of not less than 3, not more than 1, and 
1-3 indicate respectively a fluid lubrication 
condition, a boundary lubrication condition, and a 
mixed lubrication condition in which the fluid 
lubrication condition and boundary lubrication 
condition are seen in a mixed state, and that, as a 
value of Λ becomes large, the contact between sliding 
surfaces is alleviated to cause the sliding 
characteristics of these surfaces to be improved. 
Therefore, since a minimum clearance or a minimum 
thickness hmin of an oil film between the sliding 
parts under the same
