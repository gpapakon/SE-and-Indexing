<ABSTRACT>
Tubeless printhead-priming cap (12) and system (10) for ink-jet 
printers are described. The system (10) is preferably implemented, using the 

existing printer carriage (18) drive motor, by the use of a printhead-sealing cap 
(12) having a rolling diaphragm in a lower region thereof that defines a chamber 

(20) within the priming cap (12), with the diaphragm being reciprocated, by a 
spring-returned lever (26) having a piston (22) on one end thereof, in synchronism 

with lateral and differential vertical movement of a cap-carrying sled (14). 
Priming is performed uni-directionally to avoid reverse priming of the printhead 

(16). The chamber (20) may be emptied by reversing the operation of the 
priming cap (12) to pump accumulated ink into a blotter (36) by positioning the 

priming cap (12) against an ink blotter (36) provided in a rotatable member (30) 
defining a multi-service station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to priming ink-jet printer
printheads. More particularly, the invention concerns a tubeless system that
includes a priming cap having integrally formed therewith a pump diaphragm
automatically actuated by printhead carriage movement to draw ink droplets from
a sealed printhead into a chamber formed between the cap's upper and lower
expanses.Rolling diaphragm assemblies are known to have been used in flow
control metering valves in automotive applications, e.g. internal combustion
engines, while printing applications that utilize diaphragms conventionally have
used disk-shaped diaphragms and valves to pump small quantities of ink from
reservoirs to printers via flexible tubes and conduits. Recent advances in ink-jet
printhead priming and flushing are described in my co-pending U.S. Patent
Application Serial No. 07/949,318, filed September 21, 1992 entitled "Automatic
Failure Recovery Method and System for Ink-jet Printheads", which is subject to
common ownership herewith
(European Patent Appln. No. 93306984.1 published as EP-A-0 589 583).
The system described therein requires a vacuum-and-flush
tube, a rotating cam, and a tube pinch-off follower member per
printhead, as well as a common diaphragm-type pump, drive motor clutch
mechanism and firmware for synchronously controlling a drive motor's forward
and reverse rotation. The system is effective in priming and flushing ink from
plural printheads, thus to avoid clogging of the printheads' nozzles, but it involves
many moving parts and their attendant cost of production and maintenance and
it is subject to accumulation of ink and particulate in the tubes. The system also
requires a relatively long, e.g. twenty second or more, cycle time during which the
ink-jet printer is out of service.The invented system requires fewer parts, involves lower cost and
achieves higher reliability than previous ink-jet printhead-priming systems. It is
preferably implemented, using the existing printer carriage drive motor, by
integrally molding a rolling diaphragm into a lower region of a printhead-sealing 
cap, with the diaphragm being reciprocated by a spring-returned lever in
synchronism with lateral and differential vertical movement of a cap-carrying
sled,
wherein priming is accomplished uni-directionally to avoid reverse priming of the
printhead. There are no tubes subject to becoming clogged with ink or other
particulate. Out-of-service printhead-priming cycle time is reduced to under five
seconds, thus increasing long-term

A tubeless ink-jet carriage-mounted printhead priming system
(10) comprising:


a piston member (22) having a distal end (22
b
);
a first drive mechanism (24) for reciprocating said distal end (22
b
)
of said piston member (22) generally along a predefined axis (A);
a generally vertically reciprocable cap (12), said cap (12) having an
upper region (12
aa
) located along said axis (A) for sealingly engaging a printhead
(16) in a first predefined position of said cap (12) relative to a horizontally

reciprocal carriage (18) that mounts such printhead (16), said cap (12) having a
receptacle (20) formed therewith for receiving ink droplets introduced thereinto

from the printhead (16); and
said receptacle (20) having a diaphragm located along said axis (A)
and defining a lower region of said receptacle (20), said diaphragm having on a

lower surface thereof structure (12
ga
) operatively engaging said distal end (22
b
)
of said piston member (22),
said diaphragm being flexed by generally vertical reciprocation of
said distal end (22
b
) of said piston member (22) in predefined synchronization
with such carriage (18) with said cap (12) in sealing engagement with the

printhead (16) to prime the printhead (16) thereby to cause ink droplets to exit
the printhead (16) and to be collected in said receptacle (20).
The system (10) of claim 1 which further comprises a second
drive mechanism (28) for lowering said cap (12) to a second predefined position

below said first predefined position in predefined synchronization with
reciprocation of said piston member (22) such that said cap (12) sealingly engages

the printhead (16) only during a downstroke of said piston member (22). 
The system (10) of claim 2 which further comprises a
moveable sled (14) operatively coupled with said second drive mechanism (28)

and mounting said cap (12), wherein lowering of said sled (14) effects such
lowering of said cap (12).
The system (10) of claim 2 which further comprises a
rotatable member (30) mounting said cap (12) for selective sealing engagement

of the printhead (16) thereby when said rotatable member (30) is rotated to a
first predefined position of proximity between said cap (12) and such printhead

(16).
The system (10) of claim 4 which further comprises a blotter
(36) disposed adjacent the periphery of said rotatable member (30) in arcuately

spaced relationship with such printhead (16) for blotting of ink collected in said
receptacle (20) when said rotatable member (30) is rotated to a predefined

second position of proximity between said cap (12) and such blotter (36). 
The system (10) of claim 1, wherein said cap (12) includes
an upper expanse (12

substantially sealed chamber (20) of nominal volume into which ink can be drawn,

said lower expanse (12

e
, 
f
) enabling the volume of said chamber (20)
alternately to be decreased and increased by piston action, thereby to prime the

printhead by producing relatively reduced pressure in said chamber (20) to draw
ink thereinto from such printhead (16) with such printhead (16) sealingly engaged

by said lip region (12
aa
).
The system (10) of claim 6, wherein said upper and lower
expanses (12

The system (10) of claim 8, wherein the thickness of said
lower extent of said sidewalls (12
c
, 
d
, 
e
