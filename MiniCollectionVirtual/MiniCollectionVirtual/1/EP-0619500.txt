<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnets of the kind used for
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and more especially it relates
to magnets having a short axial length.In order to provide good image resolution, an MRI magnet
must have a suitably sized region, known as the imaging volume,
wherein the magnetic field is highly homogeneous such that
harmonic coefficients appertaining to the field are substantially
zero up to at least the eighth order.High magnetic field homogeneity and a suitable sized
imaging volume are comparatively easy to achieve in elongate
annular magnets wherein the axial length of the magnet is long
compared with the inner diameter of the magnet. Such magnets,
having a length of about 2 metres and a clear bore diameter of
about 1 metre, which may be cryogenic electro-magnets, are
commonly used for whole body scanning apparatus.Although these relatively long magnets are generally
acceptable, short magnets are to be preferred for some diagnostic
purposes such as interventional radiology, and mammography for
example. Short magnets also increase the chance of scanning
claustrophobic patients.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
a relatively short magnet which is suitable for use in MRI
apparatus.According to the present invention an MRI magnet
arrangement comprises, an annular electro-magnet defined by a 
coil, an annular shim of magnetic material coaxially disposed
within the coil, first permanent magnet means having a field, the
direction of which is the same as the field of the coil, disposed
coaxially within the said shim and annular magnetic material
disposed coaxially within the said first permanent magnet means,
the field of which is arranged to be opposite in direction to the
field produced by the said first permanent magnet means, the
arrangement being such that the magnetic field produced in an
imaging volume within the said annular magnetic material is
substantially homogeneous.The annular magnetic material may comprise magnet means
or alternatively it may comprise mild steel, which would be
magnetised by the main magnetic field generated by the coils.
This is probably a more cost-effective method of building the
magnet than using a permanent magnet.The imaging volume may be substantially elliptical.The shim may be arranged to serve as a former on which
the coil is wound and may be made of Silicon Iron (SiFe),
laminated and slotted to remove eddy currentIt is well known from GB-A-2 184 243, that the magnetic field due to a coil or ring
of magnetic material may
