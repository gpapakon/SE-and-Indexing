<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thermostatic valve with flapper (11) controlled by a thermostatic element (26) in a unit comprising a body, a holder (21) screwed to the body, an operating knob (27) screwed to the holder, and a cover (29), this valve, intended to be factory-assembled, comprising a small number of components, and allowing replacement of its thermostatic cartridge without draining the installation on which it is fitted. According to the invention, the flapper (11) is fixed to one end of a pusher (20) housed in a chamber (211) of the holder (21) and secured to the member (24) actuated by the thermostatic element (26); the flapper, the pusher and the said member (24) are mounted slideably with respect to the holder, the said element (26) being arranged in the operating knob (27); a restoring spring (22) is seated between the pusher and the bottom of the said chamber (211). This valve is intended in particular for central heating installations.

Thermostatic valve of the type with a flap (11) controlled 
by a thermostatic element (26) in an assembly having a valve 

body, a sleeve (21) screwed to the body, an operating button 
(27) screwed to the sleeve, and a cover (29) enclosing at 

least part of the operating button and thermostatic element, 
the valve characterised in that the flap (11) is fixed to an 

end part of a pusher (20) housed in a chamber (211) in the 
sleeve (21) and fixed to a member (24) actuated by the 

thermostatic element (26), the valve, pusher and member 
actuated by the thermostatic element being mounted so as to 

slide with respect to the sleeve under the action of the 
thermostatic element which is positioned in the operating 

button (27), and in that a return spring (22) is in abutment 
at one of its ends against the pusher (20) and at the opposite 

end against the bottom of the chamber (211) in the sleeve 
(21). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that it has 
an overtravel spring (23) housed in the pusher (20) and in 

abutment at one of its ends against a face of the latter and 
at the other end against the said member (24) actuated by the 

thermostatic element. 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that it has a 
retaining ring (15) interposed between the body and the sleeve 

(21). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that it has 
sealing members between the sleeve (21) and respectively the 

body and the pusher (20), in abutment against a dish (25) 
nesting around a part of the sleeve (21). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
thermostatic element (26) includes a piston (261) in abutment 

against a member (24) itself maintained in abutment against a  
 

collar (203) on the pusher (20) by means of at least one 
spring (23). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that a stop 
(28) is fixed to the operating button (27). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
sleeve (21) has at least one shoulder (212) cooperating with a 

stop (28). 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
cover (29) is snapped around the operating button (27) and has 

steps. 
Valve according to Claim 1, characterised in that it has 
at least one body and one exchangeable cartridge clad with a 

cover (29), associated by means of a retaining ring (15).
