<ABSTRACT>
Binders suitable for water-based coating compositions, and comprising a mixture of   A) from 5 to 50 % by weight of one or more polyurethanes containing carbonate groups and having a number-average molecular mass (Mn) of 70,000 - 500,000, in the form of an aqueous dispersion obtainable by reacting   a) from 10 to 40 % by weight of one or more organic polyisocyanates which contain no hydrophilic groups or groups which can be converted to hydrophilic groups, b) from 40 to 80 % by weight of one or more relatively high molecular weight organic polyhydroxy compounds which contain no hydrophilic groups or groups which can be converted to hydrophilic groups, and which consist to the extent of at least 50 % by weight of one or more polyhydroxy polycarbonates, c) from 0.2 to 18 % by weight of one or more low molecular weight compounds which have at least two groups which are reactive towards isocyanate groups, but contain no hydrophilic groups or groups which can be converted to hydrophilic groups, d) from 1 to 12 % by weight of one or more compounds which contain, in addition to at least one ionic group or at least one group which can be converted to an ionic group, at least one hydrogen atom which is reactive towards isocyanate groups, and e) from 0 to 8 % by weight of one or more nonionically hydrophilic compounds which contain at least one isocyanate group or at least one group which is reactive towards isocyanate groups, and   B) from 50 to 95 % by weight of one or more polyurethanes having a number-average molecular mass (Mn) of from 30,000 to 500,000, in the form of an aqueous dispersion obtainable by free-radical-initiated polymerisation of one or more polyurethane macromonomers with a content of carboxyl, phosphonic acid and/or sulphonic acid groups and lateral vinyl groups, in the presence of one or more unsaturated monomers which are copolymerisable with the polyurethane macromonomer, the percentages by weight of components A) and B) each being based on the binder solids content and adding to give 100 % by weight. Also described are aqueous coating compositions containing the binders, and the use thereof in processes for the production of multilayer coatings.

A binder vehicle which is suitable for coating media which have an
aqueous basis, containing a mixture of 5


A) 5 to 50 % by weight of one or more polyurethanes which
contain carbonate groups and which have a number average

molecular weight (Mn) of 70,000 - 500,000, in the form of an
aqueous dispersion, obtainable by the reaction of


a) 10 to 40 % by weight of one or more organic
polyisocyanates, which comprise aliphatic, cycloaliphatic

and/or aromatic polyisocyanates having at least two
isocyanate groups per molecule and a molecular weight of

112 to 1000 and which do not contain hydrophilic groups or
groups which can be converted into hydrophilic groups,
b) 40 to 80 % by weight of one or more higher molecular weight
organic polyhydroxyl compounds, at least 50 % by weight of

which consist of one or more polyhydroxy polycarbonates and
which do not contain hydrophilic groups or groups which can

be converted into hydrophilic groups,
c) 0.2 to 18 % by weight of one or more lower molecular weight
compounds which contain hydroxyl and/or amino groups and

which have molecular weights of 60-400, which do not contain
hydrophilic groups or groups which ca be converted into

hydrophilic groups,
d) 1 to 12 % by weight of one or more compounds, which in
addition to at least one ionic group or at least one group

which can be converted into an ionic group contain at least
one hydrogen atom which is capable of reacting with

isocyanate groups, and 
e) 0 to 8 % by weight of one or more non-ionic, hydrophilic
compounds, which contain at least one isocyanate group or

at least one group which is capable of reacting with
isocyanate groups, and
B) 50 to 95 % by weight of one or more polyurethanes with a number
average molecular weight (Mn) of 30,000 to 500,000, in the form

of an aqueous dispersion,

obtainable by the radical-initiated polymerisation of one or more
polyurethane macromonomers with a content of carboxyl,

phosphonic acid and/or sulphonic acid groups and lateral vinyl
groups, in the presence of one or more unsaturated monomers

which can be copolymerised with the polyurethane
macromonomers.
