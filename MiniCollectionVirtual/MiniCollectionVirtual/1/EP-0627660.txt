<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an infrared sensitized, photothermographic article composed of a preformed silver halide
grain of ≤ 0,088 micron and an antihalation system with an infrared peak absorbance to visible ratio of greater
than or equal to 30 to 1 either before heat processing (with non-thermal bleach systems) or after heat processing where
thermal bleach systems would effectively reduce visible absorbance. A further improvement on this invention is the
incorporation of supersensitizers to enhance the infrared sensitivity of the article.There is a need in the art for a photothermographic material for medical diagnostic and graphic arts use that has
the ability to be efficiently, exposed by laser imagesetters or laser imagers and has the ability to form sharp black
images of high resolution and sharpness. The goal is to eliminate the use of wet processing chemicals and to provide
a simpler environmentally friendly thermal system to the customer.Light sensitive recording materials may suffer from a phenomenon known as halation which causes degradation
in the quality of the recorded image. Such degradation may occur when a fraction of the imaging light which strikes
the photosensitive layer is not absorbed but passes through to the film base on which the photosensitive layer is coated.
A portion of the light reaching the base may be reflected back to strike the photosensitive layer from the underside.
Light thus reflected may, in some cases, contribute significantly to the total exposure of the photosensitive layer. Any
particulate matter in the photosensitive element may cause light passing through the element to be scattered. Scattered
light which is reflected from the film base will, on its second passage through the photosensitive layer, cause exposure
over an area adjacent to the point of intended exposure. It is this effect which leads to image degradation. Photothermographic
materials are prone to this form of image degradation since the photosensitive layers contain light scattering
particles. The effect of light scatter on image quality is well documented and is described, for example, in T. H. James
"The Theory of the Photographic Process", 4th Edition, Chapter 20, Macmillan 1977.It is common practice to minimize the effects of light scatter by including a light absorbing layer within the photothermographic
element. To be effective, the absorption of this layer must be at the same wavelengths as the sensitivity
of the photosensitive layer. In the case of imaging materials coated on
