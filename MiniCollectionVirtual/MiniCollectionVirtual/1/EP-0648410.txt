<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cleaning device having a grip part (1) which passes at the end into a brush head (3). Fastened on the underside of the brush head (3) is a plate (2) with bristles (3'), while a hoof scraper (5) projects from the upper side of the brush head (3). Via a water connection (11), a duct (12) which passes through the grip part (1), and a changeover device (13), water may, as required, optionally be channelled, via ducts (19 and 20) located in the brush head (3), to a water-outlet opening (21) oriented in the direction of the tip of the scraper (5) or, via through-passage holes (24) in the plate, into the region of the bristles (3'). The cleaning device can thus be produced in a simple manner and makes it possible to clean an animal's hoof carefully and, in particular, quickly using only one hand.
