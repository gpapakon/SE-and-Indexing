<ABSTRACT>
A continuous film take-up apparatus comprises:
 

   a guide feeder means (20) for guiding and feeding a succession of 
film F into a film supplier; and

 
   a drive train (10) for driving a take-up reel (5) of the film 

supplier to rotate, and
 

   the guide feeder means (20) moves towards the film supplier to place 
the leading end of a current film under a film hold-down plate (7) of 

the reel (5) or the trailing end of a preceding film wound on the reel 
(5) and moves from the same while lifting up the trailing end of the 

current film from the reel (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a continuous film
take-up apparatus for taking up a plurality of tapes of film
in succession into a film magazine.For carrying out a procedure of printing pictures onto
a photographic film in a photographic printer at efficiency,
the feeding of the film to the printer is conducted with the
use of a film magazine in which a plurality of film tapes
spliced with one another using adhesive tapes are wound on a
reel.For taking up the films in the film magazine, a conventional
method includes splicing the tapes of film by hand
and manually winding the tapes onto the reel of the film
magazine.However, such a troublesome combination of the splicing
of two films by hand and the taking up the films in the film
magazine requires considerable amounts of time and labor and
the efficiency of feeding of the films will hardly be increased.We, the inventors of the present invention, have developed
and proposed a continuous film take-up apparatus for
feeding a plurality of films in succession to a photographic
printer. The continuous film take-up apparatus allows the
plural films to be continuously wound on a reel as overlapped
one after the other without splicing as compared with 
the conventional manner. In particular, the leading end of each film is placed not over
but under the trailing end of a preceding film so that the films can in a succession be
released out from the film magazine due to the friction between the leading and
trailing ends.The continuous film take-up apparatus however fails to have a scheme for
overlapping the films with the leading end placed under the trailing end automatically.
To do so, a labour process is still needed. It is thus desired to have such a scheme.In view of the foregoing conventional method of taking up films in the film
magazine, an object of the present invention is to provide an improved continuous
film take-up apparatus in which a plurality of films are fed and wound in a succession
onto a reel of the film magazine without the need of splicing the films thus ensuring
an efficient film take-up action.JP-A-62264161 discloses a magazine for storing a cut sheet having an
oscillating retaining plate supported at the back side of a sheet inlet and with the front
end thereof located near the inlet. An oscillating drive means is connected to the plate
for oscillating the front end thereof at sheet receipt and retaining positions.GB-A-2102771 discloses apparatus for storing printed sheets comprising a
rotatable band supply reel and a rotatable hub for

<CLAIMS>
A continuous film take-up apparatus (1) comprising:

a guide feeder means (20) for guiding and feeding a succession of films into a
film supplier (2); and
a drive train (10) for driving a take-up reel (5) of the film supplier (2) to rotate,
characterised by moving means (23-25) allowing said guide feeder means (20) to move

towards and away from the film supplier (2), by the guide feeder means which
comprises a guide frame (22b
1
) and a film hold down (27) arranged to allow the insertion
of a leading end of a film (F) under the trailing end of a preceding film wound on the

reel (5) or, when no preceding film is wound onto the take-up reel (5), under a film
hold down plate (7) of the take-up reel (5), and by a sensor (PH
1
)
for detecting the leading and trailing end of said film (F) so that when the trailing end

of said film is detected on the guide feeder means the drive train (10) is stopped, the guide feeder means
(20) is moved by said moving means from the take-up reel of the film supplier

so that the trailing end of the film passed through said guide frame and said film hold down still
remains on the guide frame (22b
1
) and is lifted up from the take-up reel (5) by the
movement of the guide feeder means so that the leading end of a succeeding film

fed through said guide frame and said film hold down
comes under the trailing end of said film.
A continuous film take-up apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the guide
feeder means (20) has a guide region (22b) thereof arranged to be tiltable so that when the

guide region (22b) conducts a tilting action, its front end comes close to or departs
from the film supplier (2). 
A continuous film take-up apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein the guide
feeder means (20) has feed rollers (21) for feeding the film towards the film supplier

(2) and a drive unit (23) for rotating the feed rollers (21), and the tiltable guide region
(22b) is actuated by the power of the drive unit transmitted through a common drive

shaft (24) to the feed roller (21).
A continuous film take-up apparatus of claim 1, wherein the guide feeder
means (20) advances the current film until its leading end comes under the film hold

down plate (7) or comes under the trailing end of the preceding film with some looseness.
