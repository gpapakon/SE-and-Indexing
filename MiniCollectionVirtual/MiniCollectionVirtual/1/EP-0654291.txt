<ABSTRACT>
A method of crystallizing an organic chemical includes 
a step of starting crystallization that controls a 

degree of supersaturation of a solution of an organic 
chemical so as to crystallize platy crystals predominantly, 

and a step of crystallization which is carried out immediately 
after the step of starting crystallization, the step of 

crystallization lowering a temperature of the solution 
of the organic chemical while changing a composition of 

solvents so as to lower the degree of supersaturation 
of the solution of the organic chemical thereby 

continuing crystallization predominantly of the platy 
crystals. In the method, the crystals of the organic 

chemical are crystallized by stirring the solution of the 
organic chemical such that a flow of crystallized 

platy crystals is kept in a completely suspended state 
throughout the step of starting crystallization and 

the step of crystallization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of crystallizing
an organic chemical by cooling a solution of the
organic chemical and crystallizing crystals of the organic
chemical dissolved in the solution of the organic chemical.In the production of industrial chemicals, medicines
and foodstuffs, since no sufficient purifying effect can be
obtained by solution purification, a crystallization step
is provided for ensuring the quality of final products.Fig. 3 shows a method of crystallization in the prior
art adopted for the crystallization step in the form of a
graph of a solubility curve. A crystallizing operation line
is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3. As shown in the figure,
in the conventional method, an organic chemical is dissolved in
a good solvent to form a solution of the organic chemical,
the solution is cooled to lower the liquid temperature, the
solution passes through a metastable region and a platy (plate-shaped)
crystal region to form lumpy crystals, and then the solution
of the organic chemical is cooled so as to pass through a
lumpy crystal region as it is thereby crystallizes out lumpy
crystals. The lumpy crystals have a crystal structure suitable
for production since they can easily be put to solid/liquid
separation in succeeding steps and have a high crystallization
rate. On the other hand, since the crystals are
heavy, crystallized lumpy crystals can not be kept suspended
in the solution, for example, by a small Phaudla
type stirring blade 2 as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, the
degree of supersaturation in a tank 4 loses uniformity as
shown in Fig. 6(A), and a great amount of fine acicular
crystals of a poor filtering property are crystallized
finally in an upper portion of the tank 4 in which the
degree of supersaturation is higher, thereby resulting in a
slurry of extremely poor flowability (Fig. 6B).In order to prevent such a drawback, it is necessary
to use a device used exclusively for crystallization,
which device has a large stirring blade 6 such as an anchor
type blade as shown in Fig. 4 and can make the degree of
supersaturation uniform in the tank 4 and crystallize only
the lumpy crystals. Accordingly, a great restriction is
imposed on equipment which can be used for crystallization.The present invention has been accomplished in view
of the aforementioned, and it is an object thereof to provide
a method of crystallization capable of obtaining crystals of 
a good filtering property and a slurry of a good flowability
even at a low stirring efficiency, thereby permitting
crysta
