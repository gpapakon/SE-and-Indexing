<ABSTRACT>
A programmable timer circuit is comprised of a
programmable timer counter (622) for receiving a count and

for counting to the count. A clock signal drives the
timer counter which generates a signal representative of

the count. A microprocessor generates count data in
response to programming of the microprocessor. A timer

data register (600) receive the count from
microprocessor. A first gate (620) is provided having

an enabled mode and an non-enabled mode for enabling
loading of the timer data from the timer data register

(600) to the timer counter input only in the enabled
mode. A monitoring circuit (630, 632, 642) is provided

for monitoring the timer count and enabling the gate mean
(620) to the enabled mode only when the timer has timed-out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a programmable timer circuit, and is
applicable to a programmable timer circuit for an integrated circuit
arrangement.US-A-4,161,787 describes a programmable timer module comprising:
programmable timer counter means having timer counter input means for
receiving count data and for receiving a periodical clock signal and counting
to a count representing said count data in response to said clock signal and
having an output means for generating a signal representative of said count;
a programmable means for generating count data in response to
programming of said programmable means; timer data register means for
receiving said count from programmable means; and first gate means having
an enabled mode and a non-enabled mode for enabling loading of said
count data from said timer data register means to said timer counter input
means only when said first gate means is in said enabled mode.European applications of even date are filed

<CLAIMS>
A programmable timer circuit comprising:

programmable timer counter means (622) having timer counter input
means for receiving count data and for receiving a periodical clock signal

and counting to a count representing said count data in response to said
clock signal and having an output means for generating a signal

representative of said count;
a programmable means (13) for generating count data in response to
programming of said programmable means (13);
timer data register means (600) for receiving said count from
programmable means (13); and
first gate means (620) having an enabled mode and a non-enabled
mode for enabling loading of said count data from said timer data register

means (600) to said timer counter input means only when said first gate
means (620) is in said enabled mode;

characterized by:
monitoring means (630,632,642) for monitoring said signal of said
timer counter means and enabling said first gate means (620) to said

enabled mode only when said timer counter means has generated a time-out
signal; and
a second gate means (604) having an enabled mode in response to a
control signal from said programmable means (13) for permitting said

programmable means (13) to read data written to said timer data register
means (600) without disruption of the running count of said timer counter

means (622).
A programmable timer circuit according to Claim 1, further comprising
a timer output register (606) in bus communication with said output of said

timer counter means (622) for writing each count of said timer counter means
