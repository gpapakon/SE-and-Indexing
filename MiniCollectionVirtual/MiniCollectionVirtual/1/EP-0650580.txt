<ABSTRACT>
A dry gas meter comprises a unitary core (15) which functions as the meter casing, the inner sides of two gas chambers, valve gear container (23), index housing (19) and gasways. Central partition and angled walls (17) form a dished side of gas chambers completed by diaphragm (13) and outer pans (25, 26). Upper and lower covers (30, 33) complete the body of the meter. In between the angles of walls (17) gasways (21, 22) extend from a gas inlet in lower cover (30) to the interior of the valve gear container (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DRY GAS METER BODY AND HOUSINGThis invention relates to a dry gas meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms work back-and-fort-h in chambers to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted. Such meters will be termed hereinafter "meters of the kind described". It is desired that meters of the kind described be made smaller, neater and of simpler construction without loss of strength or durability.The invention provides a meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms work back-and-forth in two chambers to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted by valve means, the oscillations of the diaphragms being translated through an index drive means for counting to give an indication of the volume of gas which has passed through the meter, the meter being formed by a unitary core providing in one piece the structure for the inner halves of the two chambers and two separate pan covers attached to the core to coπplete the chambers, characterized by said unitary core also providing a first housing for the valve means and the index drive means and first gasways connecting the two chambers to the said first housing, and second gas¬ ways connecting a gas inlet to the said first housing; and by there being upper and lower covers for said unitary core providing gas inlet and outlet means, the unitary core, pan covers and upper and lower covers being of sufficiently strong construction for no outer cover to be needed for normal use.The invention also provides for the quick and easy assembly of the meter, wherein the operation of attaching the pan covers completes the gasway connections to the pans which are otherwise integral in the core. Since no outer casing is needed, the time and difficulty of the assembly is very much reduced.A specific embodiment of the invention is shown in the accompanying drawings, in which:- Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of the main components of a gas meter, Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the upper part of the meter of Figure 1, 

 Figure 3 is a vertical section through a central unitary part of the meter of Figure 1, Figure 4 is a horizontal section on the line V - V ofFigure 3, Figure 5 is a vertical section on the line Y - Y ofFigure 3, and Figure 6 is an exploded perspective view from the upper end of the gas meter of Figure 1.The gas meter comprises two chambers (11, 12) each divided vertically by a flexible diaphragm (13) so that gas being measured may be alternately admitted and exhausted from either side of the

CLAIMS:
1. A meter of the kind in which flexible diaphragms (13) work back-and-forth in two chambers (11, 12) to which the gas being metered is alternately admitted and exhausted by valve means (60, 62) , the oscillations of the diaphragms being translated through an index drive means (67, 68, 41) for counting to give an indication of the volume of gas which has passed through the meter, the meter being formed by a unitary core (15) providing in one piece the structure for the inner halves of the two chambers and two separate pan covers (25, 26) attached to the core to complete the chambers, characterized by said unitary core (15) also providing a first housing (23) for the valve means (60, 62) and the index drive means (67, 68) and first gasways (51, 48, 47) connecting the two chambers to the said first housing, and second gasways (21, 22) connecting a gas inlet to the said first housing; and by there being upper and lower covers (30, 33) for said unitary core providing gas inlet and outlet means (31, 34'),the unitary core, pan covers and upper and lower covers being of sufficiently strong construction for no outer cover to be needed for normal use.
2. A meter as claimed in claim 1, further characterized by said separate pan covers (25, 26) providing ports (50) which make connections to the appropriate gasways (47, 48) when the covers are attached to the core (15) .
3. A meter as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, further characterized by said gas inlet (31) being formed in the lower cover (30) and communicating with a lower housing (20) formed in the lower end of the unitary core (15) .
4. A meter as claimed in claim 3, further characterized by said unitary core (15) comprising a central partition (16) forming one side of each of the two chambers (11, 12), angled walls (17) forming dished shapes for the chambers and gasways (21, 22) lying in the angle between angled walls (17) and connecting the lower housing (20) with the first housing (23). 


5. A meter as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, further characterized by said unitary core (15) also providing an index housing (19) and there being a cover (35) attached to said index housing and providing a viewing plate.
6. A meter as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, further characterized by said upper cover (33) providing a gas outlet (34') which coimiunicates with an exhaust tube (36) in the first housing (23) , which exhaust tube is forked to provide a pair of entrances (61) associated with the valve means (60, 62).
7. A meter as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, further characterized by said unitary core (15) being a die casting in aluminium.
8. A method of assembling a gas meter as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized by the step of assembling the pan covers (25, 26) to the unitary core (15) being sufficient to make all the integral gasway connections necessary to the meter.
