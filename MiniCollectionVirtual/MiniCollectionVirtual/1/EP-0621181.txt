<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for making joints on hoop-iron straps surrounding packages, in which the overlapping ends of the strapping hoop are connected to one another by welding and the overlapping ends of the strapping hoop are held on one another over their surface and are connected to one another partially over the cross-section by contactless arc welding, with a supply of inert gas, so as to leave strips located at the edge of the longitudinal sides and so as to leave a strip containing the end face, the overlapping ends serving as a counter-electrode.

A method of producing closures on steel tape hoops around packaged 
units, wherein the overlapping ends (10,11) of the hoops (12) are connected 

to each other by welding, characterised in that the overlapping ends (10, 11) 
of the hoop (12) are held one above the other surface-to-surface and are 

connected to each other partially over the cross-section by non-contact 
arc-welding while adding inert gas in such a manner that strips lying at the 

edge of the longitudinal sides are omitted and a strip containing the end face 
is omitted, wherein the overlapping ends serve as a counter electrode and 

the weld joint is maintained free of mechanical tensile load during the 
welding process. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that the non-contact 
welding of the overlapping ends (10, 11) of the hoop (12) is carried out using 

an electrode, in particular a tungsten electrode (13), which co-operates with 
the counter electrode. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
arc-welding carried out using the electrode (13) is ignited in a situation of 

proximity but without contact in a known manner by means of an ignition 
generator.  

 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the protective gas added simultaneously with the arc-welding process is 

formed by an inert gas such as argon. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the non-contact welding of the overlapping ends (10, 11) of the hoops (12) 

is carried out using the electrode (13) which has a limited amount of 
movement in the lengthwise direction of the hoop (12). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the overlapping ends (10, 11) of the hoop (12) are welded together in the 

region of the lengthwise centre line of the hoop (12). 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that 
the welding is carried out in a region which is at least almost circular in 

shape. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that 
more than one circular region is welded along the lengthwise centre line. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that 
any desired length of weld joint is produced along the lengthwise centre line.  

 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that 
the electrode (13) is cooled during the arc-welding process. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that 
the size of the welding electrode (13) and the strength of current and the 

duration of the arcing are such that at the upper-lying hoop end (10) the 
metal in the region of the arcing is continuously liquefied and at least the 

upper region of the hoop end (11) lying below is heated until the weld joint 
melts flowing into each other. 
A device for welding the overlapping ends (10,11) of a hoop (12) 
consisting of a conventional hoop-sing machine, preferably having a 

hooping channel, a supply tape reel, a welding device and a feed and 

separating device, characterised in that the welding device consists of a non-contact 
arc-welding device which comprises a welding electrode (13) and a 

tape guide and inert gas is added, wherein the overlapping ends of the hoop 
serve as a counter electrode and the weld joint is maintained free of 

mechanical tensile load during the welding process. 
A device according to claim 12, characterised in that the welding 
electrode (13) is applied over a central region containing the longitudinal axis 

of the tape guide.  
 
A device according to claim 12 and 13, characterised in that the 
electrode (13) is attached at a holding device which can be displaced over 

the lengthwise centre line of the hoop (12) and the holding device is 
equipped with a drive. 
A device according to any one of claims 12 to 14, characterised in that 
the surface of tape guide supporting the hoop is at least copper plated below 

the electrode (13). 
A device according to any one of claims 12 to 15, characterised in that 
the electrode (13) is surrounded by a tube (14) carrying a protective gas. 
A device according to any one of claims 12 to 16, characterised in that 
the electrode (13) is formed by a tungsten electrode. 
A device according to any one of claims 12 to 17, characterised in that 
an inert gas such as argon can be used as the protective gas. 
A device according to any one of claims 12 to 18, characterised in that 
in particular at the upper end of the electrode (13) is provided a cooling 

process, which is in particular air-cooled or water cooled or similar. 
A device according to any one of claims 12 to 19, characterised in that  
 

the welding device is provided with a pulse generator.
