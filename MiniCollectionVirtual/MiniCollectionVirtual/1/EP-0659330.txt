<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for isolating electronic devices (38) from mechanical shock and thermal environments utilizes a metal outer protective shell (12 and 14) surrounding the electronic device to be protected. Interposed between the protective shell and the electronic device are a thermal insulating layer (20 and 22), a layer of phase change material (28 and 30) a layer of mechanical shock absorbent material (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to crash survivable
protective enclosures for flight recorders used in
aircraft and other vehicles operating over land and
water. More particularly, the invention is directed
toward a crash survivable enclosure which is capable of
withstanding high impact, shock and mechanical penetration
forces that commonly occur in a crash and the high
temperatures, flames and heat that often develop after a
crash. In addition, the enclosure is specially designed
for resisting damage to solid state memory devices contained
therein, even if the enclosure is subjected to
immersion in fresh water or salt water for a prolonged
period.Solid state memory devices have been used in
flight recorders for recording essential flight data or
information useful in determining causes of crashes or
other mishaps in aircraft and other vehicles. When a
crash occurs, it is essential that the recorded information
on board survive the crash and subsequent events
including heat, cold, flame and fire that may afterwards
ensue. In addition, should the crash or impact occur
over the ocean or another body of water, it is essential
that the crash survivable portion of the flight data
recorder remain intact for a prolonged period of time,
even though the enclosure is submerged to a substantial
depth in sea water or fresh water until the recorder is
eventually located and retrieved for examination of the
data contained in the solid state memory devices thereof.United States Patent No. 4,694,119 discloses a
solid state memory contained in a small crash protective 
container. The device is encapsulated in a heat sink
formed of a synthetic amide wax designed to change phase
at a temperature below the maximum acceptable temperature
of the memory device to thereby protect the solid state
memory or other solid state devices from damage due to
heat and fire.United States Patent No. 4,944,401 also discloses
a solid state memory device carried in a crash
survivable protective enclosure and encapsulated in a
synthetic wax having a relatively high heat of fusion so
as to provide a heat sink for the protection of the solid
state memory device contained in the protective enclosure.United States Patent No. 5,123,538 discloses a
similar devices having an inner enclosure that acts as a
sacrificial anode to protect an electronic device from
salt water. A plastic or rubber conformal coating
surrounds the device contained in the inner enclosure.While the systems disclosed in the above-mentioned
patents provided good penetration

Apparatus for isolating an electronic device (36)
from mechanical shock and thermal environments,

comprising:

a layer of a rubber-like material (40) surrounding
said electronic device (36);
a mass of wax-like material having a high heat of
fusion for absorbing a substantial quantity of heat before

rising above a critical temperature limit;
a heat insulating layer (20,22) surrounding said
mass of wax-like material; and
a metal shell (12,14) surrounding said heat
insulating layer (20,22); and

CHARACTERIZED IN THAT the wax-like material
comprises two pre-formed sections (28,30), at least one of

said sections (28,30) having a cavity (32,34) formed
therein such that said rubber-like material (40) is

contained in said cavity (32,34), said wax-like material
disposed to be in continuous direct contact with and

surrounding said rubber-like material (40);
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein:

said rubber-like material (40) is silicone rubber.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein:

said silicone rubber has a non-adhesive property so
as to be readily peeled away from said electronic device

(36).
An apparatus according to claim 2 or claim 3,
wherein:


said silicone rubber is of a type that cures in
approximately twenty-four hours after being applied to

said electronic device (36).
A method of isolating an electronic device (36) from
mechanical shock and thermal environments, comprising the

steps of: 

providing a mass of wax-like material (28,30) having
a high heat of fusion for absorbing a substantial quantity

of heat before rising above a critical temperature limit,
said mass taking the form of two pre-formed sections

(28,30), at least one of said sections having an
accessible cavity (32,34) formed therein;
filling said cavity (32,34) with a fluid that
subsequently cures into a solid (40) having a rubber-like

consistency;
placing said electronic device (36) into the
fluid-filled cavity (32,34);
assembling said two sections (28,30) to render the
cavity (32,34) inaccessible;
applying heat insulating material (20,22) around an
outer surface (24,26) of said mass of wax-like material

(28,30) for minimizing heat transfer to said electronic
device (36); and
surrounding said heat insulating material (20,22)
with a metal shell (12,14) for minimizing impact forces

directed toward said memory device (36) from outside said
shell.
A method according to claim 5, including the step
of:


curing said fluid to form a resilient layer (40) of
shock resistant material for protecting said memory device

(36) against mechanical shock forces.
A method according to claim 5, wherein:

said fluid is a silicone rubber of a type that cures
in time to form a layer of rubber-like consistency.
A method according to claim 7, wherein:

said silicone rubber has a non-adhesive property
after curing so as to be readily peeled away from said

electronic device (36).
A method according to claim 7, including the step
of:


curing said silicone rubber for a period of
