eliminates the need for individual apparatus by apparatus adjustment 

of equivalent primary resistance and leakage inductance of an AC 
motor and drives the AC motor stably, a variable seed driving 

apparatus for an AC motor is provided, comprising a reference AC 
voltage generator (103) which outputs reference AC voltage values 

including a frequency and amplitude of AC voltage; a power converter 
(102) which supplies AC voltage of variable voltage and variable 

frequency to an AC motor (101); current detectors (105 to 107) which 
detect output currents of the power converter (102); a regulator 

(104) further comprised of amplifiers (120 to 122) which amplify 
detected current values detected by the current detectors (105 to 

107); and a subtracters which subtract output signals of the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a variable speed driving
apparatus for an AC motor which controls primary resistance and/or
leakage inductance of the AC motor at the desired values.Figure 13 is a block diagram of a variable speed driving
apparatus according to the prior art. In Figure 13, reference
numeral 101 designates an AC motor such as an induction motor or a
synchronous motor; 102 designates a power converter such as an
inverter; and 103 is a reference AC voltage value generator which
feeds unique reference frequency and amplitude values of AC voltage
supplied to the AC motor 101 via the power converter 102.This variable speed driving apparatus drives the AC motor at
variable speed by employing the power converter as a variable voltage
and variable frequency power supply.In the figure, symbols v1a*, v1b*, and v1c* designate
reference primary voltage values of the phases (a phase, b phase and
c phase) of the AC motor 101, and v1a, v1b, and v1c designate
primary voltage values (detected values).In the above described prior art, the reference frequency
and amplitude values directly output from the reference AC voltage
value generator 103 should be adjusted in each case to stably drive
the AC motor, since optimum reference frequency and amplitude values
differ depending on the primary resistance consisting of the
resistance of a stator and wiring resistance of the AC motor 101, and
the leakage inductance.Moreover, the adjustment itself is very difficult because of
the complexity of the relationship between the primary resistance or
the leakage inductance and the values of adjustment.In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention
is to provide a variable speed driving apparatus for an AC motor
which electrically adjusts equivalent primary resistance and leakage
inductance of the AC motor to the desired values, eliminates
cumbersome individual adjustment, and facilitates stable drive of the
AC motor. The object of the present invention is achieved
by providing a variable speed driving apparatus
for an AC motor, which comprises a reference AC voltage generator for
outputting first reference AC voltage values including a frequency and
amplitude, and a power converter for supplying AC voltage of variable
voltage and variable frequency based on second reference AC voltage
values, with current detectors for detecting phase currents output
from the power converter; a first regulator which further comprises
amplifiers for amplifying the phase current values detected by the
current detectors; and
