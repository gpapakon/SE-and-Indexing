<ABSTRACT>
Polycarbonate batches dissolved in dichloromethane 
and having a solids content ranging from about 10 to 

about 30 weight percent are solution blended in a 
vessel. The batch-to-batch viscosity (MW) variability 

is reduced by about 40 to about 260 percent. The 
invention is effective with polycarbonate materials in 

the molecular weight range of about 15,000 to about 
100,000 amu, regardless of chain terminator, co-monomer 

or branching agents used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to a method and apparatus 
for reducing batch-to-batch variability in the 
manufacture of polycarbonate resins and, in particular, 
to solution blending of polycarbonate batches prior to 
the recovery of polycarbonate powder by precipitation, 
concentration and drying. Polycarbonates (PC) are manufactured by the 
interfacial reaction of bisphenols, for example, 
bisphenol-A (BPA) in a methylene chloride and water 
carrier, with phosgene in a two phase reaction medium 
including inorganic caustic (e.g. NaOH) and an organic 
solvent (e.g. dichloromethane). Variations in the amounts of reactants and the end 
capping have resulted in batch-to-batch viscosity (e.g. 
molecular weight) variations in the final polycarbonate 
product. These variations can result in significant 
processing difficulties for the end user. A known method for alleviating viscosity 
variability has been to combine batches of the finished 
product, i.e., polycarbonate powder, and dry blend the 
material in a vessel. The method is somewhat effective 
to reduce batch-to-batch variability, however, lot-to-lot 
variability is greater than desired and creates 
processing problems for the end user. The dry blending 
expedient is also inefficient. Finally, dry blending 
is usually effected at the compounding location which 
is different from the manufacturing location. This 
reduces productivity and process cost effectiveness 
both in terms of operational and capital requirements. It is therefore desirable to decrease the batch-to-batch 
viscosity variability (e.g. MW) inherent in 
the batch interfacial polycarbonate manufacturing process.  The present invention is based upon the discovery 
that post reaction solution blending of the 
polycarbonate product can decrease the batch-to-batch 
viscosity variability significantly. In a particular 
embodiment, the polycarbonate is dissolved in a 
solvent, e.g., dichloromethane. The solution has a 
solids content ranging from about 10 to about 30 weight 
percent. Solution blending results in a batch-to-batch 
viscosity variability reduction in a range from about 
40 percent to about 260 percent. The invention is 
effective with polycarbonate materials in the molecular 
weight range of about 15,000 to about 100,000 amu, 
regardless of chain terminator, co-monomer or branching 
agents used. The process modification of the present 
invention results in a higher quality polycarbonate, in 
that, the batch-to-batch viscosity variability is 
significantly reduced which results in
