<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) is provided for the 
termination of jacketed multi-conductor electrical cable (12). 

The connector includes a connector housing (20) defining a first 
bounded opening (34) which permits passage of the cable 

therethrough. The cable strain relief device (100) is positioned 
adjacent the first bounded opening of the housing. The 

cable strain relief device includes first and second 
hermaphroditic strain relief members (102,104) for securing the cable 

therebetween. The first strain relief member (102) is fixedly 
positioned within the housing and the second strain relief 

member (104) is movably supported with respect to the first strain 
relief member. The first and second strain relief members (102,104) 

define a fully bounded opening surrounding the cable. The 
first and second strain relief members (102,104) are movable so as to 

reduce the size of the seconded bounded opening for 
frictionally securing the cable thereat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
improvements in electrical data connectors. More
particularly the present invention relates to a shielded
compact data connector which permits the transmission of
signals at high data ratesIn the field of data/communications technology,
information in the form of electrical signals is being
transmitted at ever increasing speeds. Along with the
desire to transmit information at faster data rates, the
industry has also seen the need to reduce the size of
hardware employed so as to increase portability and ease of
use. In order to keep pace with these improvements, the
interconnection technology, which includes electrical cables
and electrical connectors designed to connect such hardware,
has also undergone significant changes. Electrical
connectors and cables are now available which are much
smaller in size and capable of transmitting data at higher
rates.Continued improvement in connection technology is
not without problems. When decreasing the size of
electrical connectors while requiring the connectors to
transmit data at higher rates, cross-talk between adjacent
conductive components of the connector becomes a factor
which must be addressed. Additionally, as these components
are normally used in close proximity to other electronic
components, the individual connector components must be
shielded from electro-magnetic interferences and radio-frequency
interferences. These interferences can adversely
affect the performance levels of the connectors especially
at higher data rates. An additional demand on connector technology is that
the connector components must be "user friendly". That is,
the components must be easy to assemble as well as easy to
connect and disconnect. Further, the portability of many
electronic components requires that these connections and
disconnections be repeated many times. A connector must be
able to withstand the rigors of repeated interconnection
without degradation of mechanical or electrical performance.It can be appreciated that merely "downsizing" a
connector will be insufficient to meet the current
requirements of the industry. Smaller connectors must be
designed to meet increased signal transmission requirements,
and provide for internal and external shielding as well as
long term reliable mechanical performance.DE-A-2023168 discloses a cable clamp for holding a
