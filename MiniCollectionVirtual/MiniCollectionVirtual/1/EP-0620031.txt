<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel design of a rolling-skating board, having a standing board 1 forming a standing surface for a user with two wheel axles (3), on each of which at least two wheels (4) are rotatably mounted, with a mounting for connecting the wheel axles (3) to the standing board (1), and with steering gears (6) in order to pivot the wheel axles (3) about a vertical axis (V) in order to steer by inclining the standing board (1) about its longitudinal axis (L) out of an initial position intersecting the longitudinal axis at right angles, the wheel axles (3) being provided above the standing board (1) or above the upper side of the standing board.

Skateboard with a standing board (1) forming a standing 
surface for a user, with two wheel axles (3), on which wheels 

(4) are carried in a rotating manner, with a fixing device to 
connect the wheel axles (3) with the standing board (1), and 

with steering gears (6) in order to turn the wheel axles (3) 
for steering by tilting the standing board (1) around its 

lengthwise axis (L) from an initial position cutting 
vertically through the lengthwise axis around a vertical axis, 

in which each wheel axle (3) has at least two wheels (4) and 
in which the wheel axles (3) and the steering gear are 

provided at or on the upper side of the standing board (1), so 
that when travelling on terrain through obstacles, metalling 

etc. neither the wheel axle nor its fixing device and the 
associated steering gear can be damaged.
