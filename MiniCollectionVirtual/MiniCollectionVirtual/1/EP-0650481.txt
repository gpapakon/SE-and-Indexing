<ABSTRACT>
Compounds of formula (I), wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl or acyl, R5 is alkyl, X represents a hydrophobic substituent and n is an integer from 1 to 3, and R6 and R7 each represent alkyl, cycloalkyl, or aralkyl, or R6 and R7 together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring, with the proviso that one or both of R6 and R7, or the heterocyclic ring including R6 and R7, carries and/or includes at least one oxygen or sulphur atom, or a salt or N-oxide thereof may be used in the treatment of (P.Carinii) infections.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PYRIMIDINE COMPOUNDS USED IN THE THERAPYThis invention relates to pyrimidine compounds and is particularly concerned with a class of triazenyl-substituted phenyl pyrimidines, for use in the chemotherapy of certain diseases commonly associated with AIDS or immuno-suppressed conditions resulting, for example, from cancer or organ transplantation.The use of phenyl pyrimidines and purines in the therapy of diseases such as Pneu ocvstis carinii pneumonia, which is commonly associated with AIDS patients is known. The- relative potency and selectivity of such compounds is discussed by Broughton and Queener, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, July 1991, pages 1348-1355. The pyrimidine trimethopri and the quinazoline trimetrexate are understood to target the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although of high potency, both such compounds have disadvantages in use. Thus trimethoprim used in combination with sulphamethoxazole is associated with a high percentage of adverse reactions in AIDS patients while the more potent trimetrexate has poor selectivity. These problems limit the usefulness of these agents, and they are reserved for use when the disease is so severe that the importance of side effects is diminished. Broughton and Queener also report experiments using pyri ethamine derivatives bearing a wide range of substituents at the meta and/or para position of the phenyl ring. However, the potencies obtained are many times less than those obtained with trimethoprim and trimetrexate while the selectivities obtainable are not sufficient to suggest that such compounds could displace the known drugs for treatment of £__ carinii infections and other infections such as Toxoplasma associated with AIDS.There is thus the need for development of new compounds capable of combatting such infections with sufficient 

 selectivity to enable their use for a wide range of patients.According to the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula I:wherein R1 , R2, R3 and R4 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl or acyl , R5 is alkyl, X represents a hydrophobic substituent, for example halogen or alkoxy, and n is an integer from 1 to 3, and R° and R' each represent alkyl, cycioalkyl, or aralkyl, or R^ and R7 together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring, with the proviso that one or both of R*> and R7, or the heterocyclic ring including R^ and R7, carries and/or includes at least one oxygen or sulphur atom, or a salt or N-oxide thereof.Preferably R^ , R2, R3 and R4 are
