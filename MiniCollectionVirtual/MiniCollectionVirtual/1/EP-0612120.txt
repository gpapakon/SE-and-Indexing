<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dielectric rod antenna,
which is employed for satellite broadcasting, INMARSAT
communication or the like.When a conventional dielectric rod antenna is employed as a
primary radiator for a parabolic reflector antenna, gain
difference is disadvantageously caused difference between E-plane
radiation pattern and H-plane radiation pattern as
received if either one of the dual polarized electromagnetic
wave is horizontally polarized and the other one is vertically
polarized (this wavee is hereinafter referred to as cross-polarized
wave), since the E-plane radiation pattern and the H-plane
radiation pattern of the rod antenna are different.
When the conventional dielectric rod antenna receives a
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave, on the other hand,
polarization loss is increased due to the difference in
directivity between the E-plane and H-plane radiation patterns.
In addition, the antenna efficiency is deteriorated if the
antenna has large side lobes. A known dielectric rod antenna (DE 26 48 375 Al) comprises a dielectric
rod and a cylindrical conductor housing serving as a hollow wave guide.
The dielectric rod is inserted into the conductor housing so that its forward
end portion projects therefrom. A plurality of conductors is located on the
dielectric rod at spaced locations from each other and from the conductor
housing.Another dielectric rod antenna known from US-A-3,128,467 comprises a
hollow conducting body with a coaxial input connector at its rear end and a
sleeve at its forward end for receiving a cylindrical portion of a dielectric
rod. The rear end of the dielectric rod is provided with a conductive coating
that is completely inserted into the sleeve portion of the conducting body.
The forward end of the dielectric rod is formed by a tapered portion and a
conical forward end portion.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a dielectric rod
antenna which is provided with E-plane radiation pattern and H-plane radiation
pattern having substantially equal directional patterns, and small
side lobes.According to the present invention this object is achieved by a dielectric
rod antenna as described in claim 1.According to the present invention, the conductor is
provided on an outer peripheral surface of the dielectric rod
substantially in the form of a ring, thereby uniformly
suppressing spreading of an electromagnetic wave which is
propagated through the interior of the dielectric rod and
substantially equalizing the directional patterns
