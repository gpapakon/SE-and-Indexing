<ABSTRACT>
When a discharge lamp is started, high voltage 
pulses which superpose the voltage due to LC resonance of a 

resonance circuit are applied to the discharge lamp, and 
breakdown occurs in the discharge lamp. The pulse energy 

needed for the high voltage pulses is small and the output 
power of the resonance circuit can be decreased. After the 

breakdown, the energy needed for the transfer from glow 
discharge to arc discharge is supplied by the resonance, and 

the high voltage pulses used to supply the starting energy are 
allo
wed to be stopped to be supplied. Thus, the starting and 
restriking of a discharge lamp is sure, and the size of the 

lighting device of discharge lamp can be made more compactly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lighting device 
of discharge lamp for starting a discharge lamp and for 
controlling lighting. A practical lighting device of a discharge lamp such 
as a metal halide lamp has been proposed for many years. 
R.T.Elms, J.C.Engel and G.F.Saletta (Journal of IES, 1975 
October, pp. 26 - 30) analyzed restriking process and found 
that the restriking process consists of three relatively 
independent stages: initial breakdown, hot spot formation and 
arc establishment. In order to reduce or remove substantially the 
harmful electric migration and sonic resonance which occur 
generally during lighting of a discharge lamp, there is known 
a lighting device of discharge lamp which supplies a high 
electric voltage generated by the LC resonance to the 
discharge lamp between a pair of electrodes thereof to excite 
an excitable component in the discharge lamp, then supplies 
a high frequency electric current having an amplitude within 
a predetermined range and having a predetermined repetition 
velocity to the pair of electrodes with use of a high  
 
frequency inverter, and then changes the direction of the supplied high 
frequency current in turn periodically. From US-A-4 060 752 defining the closest prior art from which the 
invention proceeds there is known a discharge lamp auxiliary circuit 
with dE/dt switching control wherein a variable frequency AC source 
drives a gas discharge lamp which is connected in parallel with the 
capacitance of a series resonance circuit. The plurality of the voltage 
applied to the resonance circuit is commutated at such times as the 
rate-of-change of current. flow in the resonance circuit is at or near 
zero. The source frequency is thus maintained at or near the circuit 
resonance frequency to maintain high output voltage when the lamp is 
starting or reigniting. The polarity is also commutated at such times 
as the current flow from the source reaches a predetermined level. The 
lamp current is thus controlled in the running mode.  
 Fig. 1 shows such a further known lighting device 
of discharge lamp disclosed in Japanese Patent laid open 
Public No. 273,183/1986. In order to start and. light a 
discharge lamp, a high voltage (resonance voltage) generated 
by the series resonance of an LC circuit consisting of a 
capacitor C2 and a choke coil L is supplied to a discharge 
lamp R. Because the resonance voltage keeps a harmonic wave 
so that a starting energy larger than an energy generated by 
applying a high voltage pulse can be supplied
