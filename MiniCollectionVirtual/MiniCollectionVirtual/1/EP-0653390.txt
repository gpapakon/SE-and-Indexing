<ABSTRACT>
A refractory mix and resultant shapes formed by 
burning the mix, the mix comprising a magnesia-alumina 

spinel grain containing at least 27% MgO by weight, a 
fused magnesite grain, and up to 10% by weight alumina, 

it being possible to substitute a sintered magnesite 
grain for up to 50% by weight of the fused magnesite 

grain.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain spinel-containing 
refractory mixes and resultant shapes, 
particularly brick suitable for use in rotary lime and 
cement kilns. U.S. Patent No. 5,021,364 describes the efforts to 
replace magnesite-chrome refractory shapes with other 
material including magnesite-spinel brick. This patent 
discloses that improved thermal spalling resistance can 
be obtained, particularly in kilns with lime-rich 
clinkers, when one utilizes a purified magnesia-alumina 
spinel grain and utilizes a dead-burned (sintered) 
magnesite therewith. SU-A-285814 discloses a rammed refractory 
composition for lining induction furnaces, said 
composition containing: 40-45 wt.% magnesite powder, 10-15 
wt.% fused magnesite and 40-45 wt.% periclase-spinellide 
powder. Such magnesite spinel brick, while having found 
general acceptance throughout the rotary cement kiln 
industry as a chrome-free alternative to magnesite-chrome 
brick, have relatively low strength at temperatures 
greater than 1371°C (2500°F) which may impart a limitation 
on the service performance of these brick. Moreover, 
in some current cement kilns magnesite-spinel brick are 
finding difficulty because these kilns are fired with 
liquid, hazardous waste fuels. Such fuels are high in 
chloride and sulfur and the present magnesite-spinel 
brick do not have a sufficiently high corrosion resistance 
to such fuels and thus they lack the desired  
 
service performance. The present invention provides magnesite-spinel 
refractory mixes and shapes, particularly brick with 
improved hot strength values and improved corrosion 
resistance. Briefly stated, the present invention comprises a 
refractory mix for forming shaped refractories, 
and a shaped 
refractory, preferably a brick, formed by burning a 
mix as set forth in claims 1 and 3, respectively. The instant invention is applicable to mixes and 
burning the same to form a variety of shaped 
refractories. It is particularly useful with respect 
to brick, especially brick for use in lime and cement  
 
kilns and will be discussed in connection therewith. The mix of the present invention comprises two 
essential ingredients, namely a magnesia-alumina 
spinel grain containing at least 27% MgO by weight and 
a fused magnesite grain. The magnesia-alumina spinel grain used must contain 
at least 27% MgO by weight. The spinel utilized need 
not be a high purity fused spinel such as in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,021,734 although it is preferred to use a 
low silica spinel. The spinel itself can
