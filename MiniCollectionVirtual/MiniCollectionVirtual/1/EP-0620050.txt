<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device and method for sorting products and articles, especially chopped fruit, according to quality and size. In the case of the invention, a photometric measuring chamber (2) having a plurality of illuminating devices (5) which are arranged in a ring and optoelectronic imager converters (6) are assigned to a feeding device (1), the illuminating devices (5) advantageously being composed of gas discharge lamps, the light of which can be emitted at wavelengths of 450 nm, 550 nm and 620 nm and the infrared component of which preferably accounts for less than 2 % of total radiation output. The illuminating devices (5) are preferably mounted outside a measuring plane and the photometric measuring chamber (2), which forms a parabolic descending channel (7), is separated in a dust tight and splash tight manner, but optically connected, via an optically transparent prismatic body, such as a glass cylinder (4). The photometric measuring chamber (2) is connected via an electronic block (10), which is arranged downstream and moves one or more separating mechanisms (9), and a collecting device (11).

A device for sorting products and articles according to quality and size
comprising a feeding mechanism, a photometric measuring chamber (2)

including an illumination device (5) and optoelectronic image
converters (6), and an electronic block (10) with associated separation

mechanisms (9), and discharge and catching means, characterised in
that


said photometric measuring chamber (2) is provided with a plurality
of annularly arranged illumination means (5) and optoelectronic image

converters (6),
said optoelectronic image converters (6) are arranged in said
photometric measuring chamber (2) in such a manner that the mean

optical axes belong to the respective surfaces of two cones arranged
apex to apex within a vertical-trop channel (7) which ensures a

distortion poor projection of the pole caps of the passing products and
in that an image of the bright background of the photometric

measuring chamber (2) is projected onto the optoelectronic image
converters (6) in the state of rest and in that the partial surfaces of an

optically transmissive prismatic glass cylinder (4) and the background
of the photometric measuring chamber (2) in the measuring planes

which are not to be projected onto the optoelectronic image
converters are so embodied as to geometry and/or colour that the light

reflected by them, and which, after being retracted at the critical angle
of the total reflection from further elements within said photometric

measuring chamber (2), impinges undesired upon said optoelectronic
image converters (6), preferably amounts to less than 2% of the mean

value of the products passing the vertical-drop channel,
in that said illumination means (5) are constituted of gas discharge
lamps emitting light at wavelengths of 450 nm, 550 nm, and 620 nm

and the infrared portion of which is less than 2% of the entire
radiation power,
and in that said illumination means (5) are provided externally of the
measuring planes and in that said photometric measuring chamber (2)

which constitutes a parabolic vertical drop channel (7) is rendered 
dustproof and watertight, but optically connected by an optically

transparent prismatic body, which optionally is said glass cylinder (4),
and in that said photometric measuring chamber (2) is connected via a
subsequent electronic block (10) which operates at least one

separation mechanism (9) to a catching device (11).
A device for sorting products and articles according to quality and size
as claimed in claim 1, wherein said at least one separation mechanism

(9) is arranged in opposition to the trajectory of the products to be
separated and wherein said catching device (11) is, for example,

parabolic shaped made of a passive area, preferably a curved plate, at
least one belt, rollers, and a belt-roller combination (12), respectively.
A method for sorting products and articles according to quality and size
in a device as claimed in one of the claims 1, 2, characterised in that

the data streams produced by the optoelectronic image converters (6) is
linewise serialised, in that a data stream is obtained for the entire

measuring surface, a further circuit compares the reference values of
the individual lines with one another and, at a respectively to be

defined departure, a further error class is established, and in that a
reference value which is indicative of the brightness of the healthy

measuring surface of the product is automatically produced for each

line from the data stream, and in that a comparison between the actual
image points and the reference values of the preceding lines is

performed and, when an error criterion is satisfied, a marking is
enabled. 
A method for sorting products and articles according to quality and size
as claimed in claim 3, wherein an evaluation circuit detects the number

and the horizontal and vertical extensions of the marked error areas to
assign the latter to respective error classes, and wherein, based on the

data volume, the data streams produced by the optoelectronic image
converters (6) and the comparison between the individual lines of the

former, an evaluation of the shape of the measuring products is given,
and a data word proportional to size is produced depending on the

number of data streams generated by the optoelectronic image
converters (6) per measuring product, said data word proportional to

size ensures a sorting according to size.
A method for sorting products and articles according to quality and size
as claimed in any of the claims 3 and 4, wherein due to the optional

assignment to individual error classes and/or classes of size of
measuring products to one or a plurality of discharge means, it is

feasible to separate at least two differently composed fractions of
articles to be sorted and wherein the point of time as well as the

activation period of the discharge means in dependence on the size of
the measuring product to be discharged can be determined by virtue of

a further non-linear operating circuit.
