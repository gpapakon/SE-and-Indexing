<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED EXPRESSION OF HUMANMULTIDRUG RESISTANCE GENES AND IMPROVEDSELECTION OF CELLS TRANSDUCED WITH SUCH GENESThis invention relates to the transduction of cells with human multidrug resistance (mdr) genes and the expression thereof, as well as the selection or identification of cells transduced with such genes. More particularly, this invention relates to the enhanced expression of mdr genes by transduced cells, and an improved method of selecting or identifying cells transduced with mdr genes.Genes for multidrug resistance such as, for example, mdrl and mutated forms thereof, encode proteins of a class known as p-glycoprotein, that confer resistance to a range of cytotoxic drugs used in the treatment of human malignancies. The introduction and expression of the mdrl gene in human cells may serve several useful purposes in the treatment of diseases. For example, the mdrl gene can function as a dominant selectable marker that will allow for positive selection of cells transduced by an expression vehicle, such as, for example, a retroviral vector, ex vivo or in vivo. Used in this manner, expression of the mdrl ene in normal human cells may be useful in increasing the proportion of a target cell population that has been transformed by an expression vehicle, such as a retroviral particle. Also, expression of the mdrl gene in normal human 

cells may permit more intensive use of chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of cancer. For example, expression of the mdrl gene in human bone marrow cells could reduce the severity and duration of cytopenias following chemotherapy, which may facilitate dose intensification while reducing morbidity and mortality.In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, ther is provided human mdrl DNA or RNA which encodes p-glycoprotein o an analogue or fragment of such DNA or RNA which encodes an iso-form of p-glycoprotein which confers multidrug resistance. The DNA or RNA includes at least one splice site, and at least one base in the splice site has been changed to a different base which thereby inactivates the splice site. Preferably, the DNA or RNA is a DNA or RNA sequence for human mdrl which encodes p-glycoprotein wherein at least one base in a splice site of sai DNA encoding p-glycoprotein is changed.The natural human mdrl gene contains at least one functiona splice donor site and splice acceptor site. This invention provides a modification of the mdrl gene whereby at least one base in a splice site has been changed to a different base which thereby inactivates
