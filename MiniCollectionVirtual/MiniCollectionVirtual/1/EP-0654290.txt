<ABSTRACT>
The toy airplane is comprised of laminar 
parts which are provided with a plurality of differentiated 

regular and irregular orifices and grooves 
for receiving and setting in place said laminar 

parts as well as the corresponding counterweights 
which modify the flight characteristics of the airplane, 

one of said counterweights being comprised 
of a spherical body which has a peripheral groove 

which may be provided with additional counterweights 
and which, in its turn, may be introduced 

in a sheath passing through an orifice of the fuselage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, as already expressed in the title of 
this patent specification, consists of improvements 
introduced in the assembly of toy airplanes, from their 
components, which main object resides in the fact of allowing 
to modify their flight characteristics, as a function of the 
number and location of counterweights located in a number of 
housing openings effected into the fuselage of the airplane. Another additional object of the invention is to allow 
carrying out different combination between fuselages and 
wings, varying its aesthetic outlook as well as the way it 
flies, to suit the taste of the user. Conventionally, planes that could be disassembled - of 
the type made up of laminar portions, do only allow a 
combination of their elements, which determines that only a 
given structure and a unique flying mode may be obtained from 
them, which characteristics may only be varied very slightly. This establishes a limitation regarding their use and 
design. Furthermore, the material used in the fabrication of 
said airplanes prevents them from being used inside a 
dwelling, given that in case of impacting against any object 
there is a certain probability of said object suffering 
damage, which constitutes a drawback and a limitation in 
respect of its use. To solve the fore mentioned drawbacks, the invention 
determines the possibility of assembly of different wings in 
various fuselages, allowing to choose the structure of the 
airplane, at the same time that a number of housing openings 
have been set onto the fuselage, into which different 
counterweights may be housed, which shape and location allow  
 
to modify the airplane flying conditions. Corresponding wing assembling grooves have been provided 
on the fuselages of the airplane to accomplish these 
objectives. Furthermore, the fuselages include, in the area 
corresponding to their "nose", an opening after which a 
second irregularly shaped opening has been provided as a 
continuation of the first one - the structure of the second 
opening is similar to that of a tear drop in which its narrow 
area is slightly arched and runs down the lower part of the 
fuselage. In the area corresponding to the slot in which the wings 
of planes are located, an opening has been drilled, centrally 
and in its forward area, followed by a number of small 
semicircular openings opposite each other on both sides of 
the slot. Similarly, the wings have been fitted with an opening 
drilled correspondingly with the opening drilled in the 
forward area of

<CLAIMS>
1. IMPROVEMENTS INTRODUCED IN THE ASSEMBLY OF TOY 
AIRPLANES, FROM THEIR COMPONENTS, which being said components 

of the type made of laminar portions, which fuselage (1) and 
(2) is fitted with slots (3) and (4) for wing assembly; - it 

is essentially characterized because the fuselage (1) and (2) 

is fitted, in the "nose" area, of a preferably circular 
opening (5), after which a second irregularly shaped opening 

(6) is then set, with a tear drop like shape in which its 
narrower end is slightly arched and runs down the lower 

portion of the fuselage (1) and (2), being designed so that 
the slot (3) for mounting the main wings (9) and (11) 

includes a preferably circular opening (7), drilled centrally 
and in its forward area, followed by a number of smaller 

semi-circular openings (8) opposite each other at either side 
of the slot (3) all of this to allow the incorporation of a 

variety of counterweights (16), (17), (21) to modify the 
flying characteristics of the airplane. 
2. IMPROVEMENTS INTRODUCED IN THE ASSEMBLY OF TOY 
AIRPLANES, FROM THEIR COMPONENTS, as per claim 1st, 

characterized because one of its counterweights is made up 
of a round body (16) which may also be fitted with a 

perimeter slot (22); and with the added characteristic that 
it has a ring shaped counterweight (21) set onto the small 

semi-circular openings (8), so that it is then attached to 
the upper or lower surfaces of the wing (9) and (11), being 

also designed so that it may also be fitted with bar 
counterweights of different lengths and with a tear drop 

shaped counterweight, curved at its narrower portion, for its 
introduction into the similarly shaped irregular opening (6). 
3. IMPROVEMENTS INTRODUCED IN THE ASSEMBLY OF TOY 
AIRPLANES, FROM THEIR COMPONENTS, as per prior claims, 

characterized because the round counterweights may be 
introduced into a square case (19) fitted with a pass through 

opening (20) for its incorporation into the fuselage (1) and 
 

(2), for which purpose the fuselage openings (5) and (7) are 
squared shaped, perfectly hiding the counterweight.
