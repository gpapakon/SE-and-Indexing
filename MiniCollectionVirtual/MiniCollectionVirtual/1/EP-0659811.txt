<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for the fabrication of fixing rolls based on a liquid silicone
rubber sponge composition, the
fixing rolls being used in copiers, facsimile
machines, printers, and so forth. The invention also
relates to said fixing
rolls.The excellent heat resistance and permanent
compression set of silicone rubbers has resulted in
their extensive use as coverings for the fixing rolls
used in copiers, facsimile machines, printers, and so
forth. In response to demands for higher levels of
fixing roll performance, fixing rolls have recently
entered into use in which the surface of the silicone
rubber covering layer is coated with a fluororesin
film. This yields additional improvements in the
ability of the surface of the roll to resist adhesion
by the toner, which is the developer. The ability of
the surface of the roll to resist toner adhesion is
known as toner releasability. Low-hardness silicone
rubbers having reduced inorganic filler loadings are
already known for use as the silicone rubber underlayer
in these fluororesin-coated rolls. However, silicone
rubber sponge has received attention as a silicone
rubber that has an even lower hardness and that
maintains a stable hardness.Fixing rolls that use silicone rubber sponge
have typically been fabricated by the following
process. A silicone rubber sponge composition is first
extrusion molded to give a cylindrical silicone rubber
sponge molding. The base component of the starting
silicone rubber sponge composition is a high-viscosity 
diorganopolysiloxane known as a silicone gum. A metal
roll core is then inserted into the silicone rubber
sponge molding with bonding through the use of
adhesive. The fluororesin is thereafter coated on the
surface, and the assembly is baked. This process,
however, suffers from several drawbacks. For example,
it may not be possible to coat the fluororesin layer
uniformly on the silicone rubber sponge surface, or
bonding between the silicone rubber sponge molding and
metal roll core may be unsatisfactory. This
fabrication process is also complex and has a low
productivity.The present invention uses
a liquid silicone rubber sponge
composition for fixing roll service that is highly
moldable and yields a silicone rubber sponge layer that
bonds well to both the metal roll core and fluororesin
film layer. An object of the invention is
the introduction of a fixing roll fabrication method
that uses the aforesaid liquid silicone rubber sponge
composition. According to the present invention there is
applied a liquid
