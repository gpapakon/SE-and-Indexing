<ABSTRACT>
Bearing (14) of the type having a full complement of rollers 
incorporating an inner race ring (13), an outer race ring 

(14) and a row of rollers (15) provided between these rings, 
said rollers being axially moveable relative to the rings. 

The space between inner race ring (13) and outer race ring 
(14) is sealed off by means of sealing members (18) arranged 

on one hand to provide a sealing effect by frictional 
engagement against the inner race ring as well as against the 

outer race ring, and on the other hand to follow the rollers 
(15) in their axial movement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a sealed bearing incorporating 
an inner race ring with an inner race, an outer race 
ring with an outer race, a row of elongated rollers provided 
between and engaging the races, whereby the races and the 
rollers have curved longitudinal section profiles and which 
rollers without obstruction from annular flanges at the 
races, are axially moveable between the races relative 
thereto for allowing mutual misalignment of the races, and 
sealing members for sealing off the space between the inner 
race ring and the puter race ring. A purpose of the present invention is to provide a sealed 
bearing, wherein the increase of the overall width of the 
bearing required for the sealing arrangement is kept as small 
as possible. Another purpose of the invention is to try to maintain the 
sealing capacity of the sealing member in as far as possible 
at axial displacement between inner race ring and outer race 
ring, and at misalignment of the inner race ring relative to 
the outer race ring. These purposes have been obtained in that the invention has 
been given the features defined in the claims annexed hereto. Hereinafter the invention will be described in detail with 
reference to the accompanying drawings. The embodiment shown 
in these drawings is intended only to exemplify the invention 
within the scope of the claims. In the drawings Fig. 1 shows an axial section through a 
bearing in accordance with the invention.
 
Fig. 2 illustrates diagramatically the increase of bearing 
width required if a bearing of the type shown in Fig. 1 is 
equipped with a seal of conventional type.
 
Fig. 3 illustrates diagramatically a partial side view of a 
a bearing having a full complement of rollers and with the  
 
seal removed. In the bearing designated 10 in Fig. 1, the races 11, 12 on 
the inner race ring 13 and the outer race ring 14 resp. are 
each shaped with concave profile. The elongated rollers 15 
provided between the races 11, 12 are axially displaceable 
between the races without obstruction from annular flanges 
at the races in order to allow mutual misalignment between 
the inner race ring 13 and the outer race ring 14. As can be 
seen from Fig. 3 the bearing is designed as a bearing having 
a full complement of rollers, i.e. without any cage. The bearing is designed such as shown and described in US-A-4705411, 
and therefore this publication is incorporated in 
the present specification. If the bearing 10 should be provided with sealing members of 
conventional type, i.e.

<CLAIMS>
Sealed bearing incorporating an inner race ring (13) with 
an inner race (11), an outer race ring (14) with an outer 

race (12) a row of elongated rollers (15) disposed between 
and engaging said races, whereby races (11, 12) and rollers 

(15) have curved longitudinal section profiles and which 
rollers (15), without obstruction from annular flanges at the 

races, are axially moveable between the races relative 
thereto for allowing mutual misalignment of the races, and 

sealing members (18) for sealing off the space between the 
inner race ring (13) and the outer race ring (14),characterized therein, 

that the bearing is designed as a cage-free bearing with a 
full complement of rollers, and that each sealing member 

(18) is formed separately, but adapted to follow the rollers 
(15) at their axial movement and arranged to provide its 

sealing effect by frictional engagement against the inner 
(11) as well as against the outer race (12). 
A sealed bearing as claimed in claim 1,characterized therein, 
that the sealing member (18) is adapted, under influence of 

the rotational movement of the rollers (15), to be rotated 
in the circumferential direction of the bearing. 
A sealed bearing as claimed in claim 1 or 2,characterized therein, 
that the sealing member (18) is provided with carrier means 

(19) arranged to cooperate with the rollers (15), thus that 
the sealing member (18) is carried alon
g by the rollers (15) 
at rotation of the bearing. 
A sealed bearing as claimed in claim 3,characterized therein, 
that said carrier means (19) being adapted to engage in the 

space between two adjacent rollers (15). 
A sealed bearing as claimed in anyone of the preceding 
claims,characterized therein, 

that the sealing member (18) is produced entirely flexible, 
e.g. from rubber.
