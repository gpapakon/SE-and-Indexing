<ABSTRACT>
For a vehicle door which is suspended on the vehicle body by means of an articulated parallelogram, such that, during opening and closing, it executes a pivoting movement on which a transverse movement is superposed, and which is equipped with a locking device which consists of a locking bar or locking bolt fastened preferably to the body and of a lock latch cooperating with the said locking bar or locking bolt and having a pre-catching and a main catching position, there is proposed a door-locking device in which a fixed locking bar or locking bolt is arranged on each of the two door columns limiting the door aperture in the vehicle body and a rotary latch is arranged on each of the two end faces of the door, and in which a first rotary latch is formed by the lock latch of a door lock and is drive-connected to the second rotary latch in such a way that the lock latch is the driving and the other the driven rotary latch.

A door locking device for motor vehicle doors which are 

so mounted on the vehicle body work by means of a 
parallelogram linkage consisting of at least one 

supporting part and at least one controlling part that, 
during opening and closing, the said doors perform a 

pivoting movement on which a transverse movement is 
superimposed and are equipped with a locking device 

consisting of a locking bracket (1, 2) or locking bolt 
preferably fixed on the body work and, co-operating 

therewith, a latch which has preliminary catching and 
main catching positions, characterised in that on each 

of the two door columns which define the door aperture 
in the vehicle body work, there is a fixed locking 

bracket (1, 2) or locking bolt and on each of the two 
end faces of the doors there is a rotary latch (3, 4), a 

first rotary latch (3) being formed by the locking latch 
of a door lock which is connected for drive to the 

second rotary latch (4) in such a way that the lock 
latch (3) is the driving latch while the other is the 

driven rotary latch (4). 
A door locking device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that at least the driving latch is 

constructed as a bifurcated latch (3) while the other, 
particularly the driven rotary latch (4), is constructed 

as a pawl.  
 
A door locking device according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the two rotary latches (3, 4) each 

comprise a trapping or preliminary catching position and 
an engagement zone marking a locking or interlocking 

position of the doors. 
A door locking device according to claim 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the fork tines (11, 12) which 

define the opening in the bifurcated and driving locking 
latch (3) are of unequal length, whereby that portion of 

the longer fork tine which projects beyond the shorter 
fork tine (12) marks the preliminary catching or 

trapping position of the doors. 
A door locking device according to claim 1 to 4, 
characterised in that there is associated with at least 

the bifurcated latch a locking pawl (15) which, both in 
the trapping or preliminary catching position and also 

in the locking position secures the bifurcated latch 
against retro-rotation and which can be disengaged 

particularly by hand. 
A door locking device according to claim 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the bifurcated latch (3) and the 

locking pawl (15) are mounted opposite each other in 
such a way that they pivot about fixed axes and in 

opposite directions, the locking pawl (15) co-operating 
with the bifurcated end of the locking latch (3). 
A door locking device according to claim 1 to 6, 
characterised in that when the locking latch is in the 

trapping or preliminary catching position, the locking  
 

pawl (15) engages the free end of the longer fork tine 
(11) and engages the trailing surface (17) of the 

shorter fork tine (12) when the bifurcated latch is in 
the locking or main catching position. 
A door locking device according to claim 1 to 7, 
characterised in that a catching projection (18) is 

disposed on the back or trailing surface (17) of the 
short fork tine (12) of the locking latch (3) to secure 

engagement of the locking pawl (15). 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the driven rotary latch (4) is 

connected for drive to the driving locking latch (3) via 
at least one coupling member (7, 60) such as a coupling 

rod, pull wire or Bowden control cable for transmitting 
at least tractive forces. 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that at least the driving locking latch 

(3) is subject to spring force in the direction of its 
release position. 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that both rotary latches, the driving 

locking latch (3) and the driven locking latch (4) are, 
in the direction of their release position, subject to a 

spring force which is in particular applied by a draw 
spring. 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 
11, characterised in that in conjunction with the 

disposition of a spring loading arrangement (14), a  
 

fixed abutment (20) which defines its extreme open 
position is associated with at least one of the two 

rotary latches (3). 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 
12, characterised in that each of the two rotary 

latches (3, 4) is equipped with an extension piece which 
forms a lever arm (8), said rotary catches (3, 4) being 

connected to each other for drive via two crosswisely 
disposed traction members (7, 60), particularly Bowden 

control cables or pull wires, each traction member in 
each case connecting the lever arm of one with the latch 

part of the other rotary latch. 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 
12, characterised in that the two rotary latches (3, 4) 

are connected to each other for drive via a coupling 
member (7, 60) which only transmits pressure and 

traction forces. 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 
14, characterised in that the locking pawl (15) can be 

displaced by means of a manually operable door handle. 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 
14, characterised in that the locking latch (3) or the 

locking pawl (15) can be displaced from the trapping or 
preliminary catching position and the main catching or 

locking position by means of a motor drive, particularly 
an electric motor. 
A door locking device according to one of claims 1 to 
15, characterised in that the locking bolt or locking 

bracket (1, 2) is supported on the door column in such a  
 

way that it is displaceable in a vertical guide and can 
be displaced by means of a motor drive, particularly by 

an electric motor, to move it out of the trapping or 
preliminary catching position of the bifurcated latch 

into a position corresponding to the main catching or 
locking position of the bifurcated latch.
