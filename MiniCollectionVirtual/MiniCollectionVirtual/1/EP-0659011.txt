<ABSTRACT>
A raster scanning system (30) is disclosed which utilizes a laser light source (32) with a 
plurality of diodes (34,36), at least two of which are offset relative to each other. Either one diode or 

two offset diodes (34,36) will be selected to scan one scan line. If two offset diodes (34,36) are 
selected, two light beams (38,40) can be generated to scan two partially overlapping paths (spots S
a
, 
S
b
) to form a scan line (spot S
r
; Fig. 3). By changing the intensity of the two light beams (38,40) or by 
selecting two different offset diodes (34,36), the scan line (spot S
r
; Fig. 3) can be moved up or down in 
the sagittal plane (50). This concept can be used to correct the wobble of a scan line (spot S
r
; Fig. 3) in 
which case, either one diode or two offset diodes (34,36) will be selected to scan one scan line (spot 

S
r
; Fig. 3) in its correct position. Also, the same concept can be used to correct a bow of a scan line 
(spot S
r
; Fig. 3) in which case, either one diode or two offset diodes (34,36) will be selected for each 
pixel to correct the bow in accordance with a pre-defined correction data for that pixel which is 

stored in a memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a raster scanning system, and more particularly, to a raster
scanning system which utilizes a dual light source for wobble correction caused by different factors
such as an imperfect facet of a scanning polygon.A raster scanner typically includes a number of optical elements to accommodate a
specific design. Unavoidable imprecision in the shape and/or mounting of these optical elements will
inevitably introduce certain anomalies in the quality of the scan line on the photoreceptor such as
wobble or bow.Wobble is defined as the displacement of a scan line in the cross-scan or sagittal plane
from its intended position. Typically, a wobble error in an optical scanning system is caused by
different factors such as the rotating facet not being exactly parallel to the vertical axis. In this case,
the beam reflected from the facet is thereby angled up or down for a small amount resulting in scan
line displacement errors in the sagittal plane.Wobble errors can be caused by several factors. The motor driving the rotating polygon
mirror can vibrate during operation. The motor shaft can deviate from its rotational axis. The facets
of the polygon mirror can have irregular surfaces which do not lie parallel to each other.Extreme precision in the manufacturing of the motor, the motor shaft and the polygon
mirror can reduce wobble, but not eliminate it. Such precision also increases the steps of production
and makes mass production of the scanning system virtually impractical and commercially cost
prohibitive.Many systems have been disclosed in the art to overcome a wobble caused by different
factors such as in EP-A-0549204 or in Xerox disclosure journal, vol. 17, nÂ°5, 31 October 1992, Stanford, US, pages 393-399, F.C. Genovese: "Multiple-spot beam control for a raster output scanner"'. Typically, they involve an intricate series of anamorphic lenses or non cylindrical and non-spherical
lenses such as toroidal-shaped ones or mirrors to reflect the beam off the facet several times
or even deviation feedback by optical sensors to provide electronic synchronization of the beam.
Also, proposed has been a series of f-theta lenses which can be adjusted relative to each other based
on complex formulae to correct for wobble and other optical distortions.A problem with the prior art systems to correct wobble is that some of the lens elements
are very expensive. Another factor in the high cost of correcting wobble is the high fabrication and
assembly tolerances required for the optical scanning system
