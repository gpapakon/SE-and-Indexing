The method is carried out in a two-phase aqueous-organic system in which the organic phase contains the unsaturated fatty acid and/or the esters thereof and the aqueous phase contains hydrogen peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing 
carboxylic acids or esters thereof by the oxidative 
cleavage of unsaturated fatty acids or esters thereof 
in a two-phase aqueous-organic system in which the 
organic phase contains the unsaturated fatty acid 
and/or the esters thereof and the aqueous phase 
contains hydrogen peroxide. The oxidative cleavage reaction of the most common 
unsaturated fatty acids and their esters may be 
represented in the following manner: 
 
where 
p = 0-1, m = 0-2, t = 0-11, z = 1-3, R1 = H, C1-C8 alkyl or a CH3-(CH2)5-CH(OH)-CH2-radical, if z = 1, A is H or C1-C5 alkyl, if z = 2-3, A is the residue of a bivalent or trivalent 
alcohol. A method of this type for the oxidative cleavage of 
unsaturated compounds is described in EP-122804, in 
which the reaction catalyst used is a compound of the 
formula 
Q3XW4O24-2n 
where Q represents a cation of an onium salt  
 
(R6R7R8R9M)+ in which M is selected from N, P, As and 
Sb and R6, R7, R8 and R9 are the same or different and 
represent hydrogen atoms or hydrocarbon groups having 
from 20 to 70 carbon atoms in total, X is an atom of P 
or As and n is a whole number selected from 0, 1 and 
2. The method according to EP-122804 also provides 
for a water immiscible solvent such as, for example, an 
aromatic or chlorinated hydrocarbon, or the like, to be 
added to the organic compound to be oxidised. This method has the disadvantages that the preparation 
of the catalysts used is complex and difficult and that 
the solvent used has to be separated from the reaction 
products and purified for possible reuse. JP-63093746 describes a method of the type indicated 
above for the oxidative cleavage of olefins, in which 
the catalyst used is a compound selected from the group 
constituted by tungstic acid, molybdic acid and 
heteropolyacids thereof. This method has the disadvantage that the conversion 
yields of the unsaturated compound are very low because 
it is difficult to transfer the catalyst from the 
aqueous phase to the organic phase. The rate of 
transfer of the catalyst, and consequently the 
conversion yield of the olefin, can be increased with 
the use of a solvent such as a C1-C4 alcohol, a C1-C4 
carboxylic acid, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, 
dimethylformamide, etc. which are effective with 
respect to both polar and non-polar compounds. In 
this case, however, there is the problem of separating 
the solvent from the reaction products and purifying it 
for possible reuse.  
 The presence of a solvent also makes it
