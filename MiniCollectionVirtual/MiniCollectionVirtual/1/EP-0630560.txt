<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically milking animals, such as 
cows, comprises a computer controlled milking machine with a 

milking unit (29) having a support (17) for teat cups (52). 
The support (17) comprises at least two supporting arms 

carrying the teat cups (52). These supporting arms are 
provided with hinging means (53, 55, 56) by means of which 

the teat cups (52) are movable with respect to the further 
part of the support (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for automatically 
milking animals, such as cows, comprising a computer-controlled 
milking machine with a milking unit having a support 
for teat cups. Such a device is known from EP-A-0 091 892. For 
the purpose of obtaining an adaptation of the position of the 
teat cups to the udder of various animals, the device is 
characterized in that the support comprises at least two 
supporting arms carrying teat cups, said supporting arms 
being provided with hinging means by means of which the teat 
cups are movable with respect to the further part of the 
support. Particularly, the support may comprise four supporting 
arms, preferably made of a strip-like material, each of 
which supporting arms carrying a teat cup, the teat cups 
being individually movable with respect to the further part 
of the support. An automatically performed adaptation of the 
position of the teat cups to the udder may be obtained when 
the hinging means comprise computer-controlled electric 
motors to control the movement of the teat cups relative to 
said further part of the support. These motors may be situated 
between a respective teat cup and a central part of the 
support. This central part may be movable around two vertical 
hinge pins while the whole support may be fastened to the 
floor. Further, according to the invention, the teat 
cups, preferably attached to the respective supporting arms, 
may be individually movable with respect to each other around 
a vertical axis.  In order to facilitate the connection of the teat 
cups to the teats, the teat cups may comprise a flaring 
construction. For a better understanding of the invention an 
embodiment of the device for milking animals will now be 
described with reference to the accompanying drawing. 
Figure 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a 
device for milking animals; Figure 2 is a schematical view along line II - II 
of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a schematic view of a cleaning and/or 
drying unit for the udder, which can be coupled automatically
