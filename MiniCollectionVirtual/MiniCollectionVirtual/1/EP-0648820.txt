<ABSTRACT>
A chemical composition for removing organic adherent matters 
comprises water and an organic compound, such as dibasic carboxylic 

ester, capable of dissolving or wetting adherents attached to the 
surface of an adherend, and additionally comprises either or both of 

surface-active agent and an additive which is selected from a group 
of alcohols, glycol-ether and pyrrolidone derivatives. The organic 

compound is dispersed in the water in an oil-in-water type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a chemical composition for 
removing organic adherent matters, which include synthetic resins 
such as toner, printing ink, and oil, from an adherend such as a 
metal, glass, plastic, concrete, or paper. It is known to use an organic solvent or water-soluble detergent 
for removing organic adherent matters (referred to as "adherents" 
hereinafter) including resins, mineral oil, and lubricant, from a body 
of metal, glass, plastic, concrete, or paper material (referred to as 
an adherend hereinafter). Such an organic solvent when used to remove adherents from an 
adherend however performs a dissolving action which causes a portion 
of the removed adherent to dissolve in the solvent. This results in 
declination of the power of dissolving of the solvent and if worse, 
the removed adherent will be attached back. A water-soluble detergent can hardly remove resins. Otherwise, a 
resin if removed by the action of the detergent is dissolved in the 
water-soluble detergent which will in turn be degraded and lessened 
in the power of cleaning. It is thus said that the water-soluble 
detergent is applicable to a limited range of use. Any conventional organic solvent or water-soluble detergent is 
capable of removing only a specific group of adherents and its 
removing power is too low to be practical. For disposal of unwanted runner rollers made by coating steel 
cores with rubber layers and used bumpers made by protecting steel 
bodies with urethane resin coatings, the rubber layers and urethane  
 
coatings are mechanically separated or incinerated to recover steel 
materials. Such a process is however low in the workability and the 
incineration will produce amounts of toxic gas causing environmental 
disruption. When the rubber layers and urethane coatings are 
dissolved using a solvent, they can never be reclaimed. Also, the cost of the solvent is not negligible. We, the inventors, have proposed a couple of novel compositions 
for removing paint or varnish which replace the conventional solvent 
with a lower boiling point, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open 
Publications 63-317567(1988) and 2-267557(1990) respectively. 
It is now found that both the compositions were not final solutions 
for the purpose. In particular, the former contains a thickening agent thus 
causing a removed adherent to be attached back to the adherend. The 
latter permits a part of the adherent to dissolve therein and will not 
be appropriate for reuse. The adherent can hardly be recovered in 
gr
