<ABSTRACT>
In a method of connecting components made of metal, especially made of aluminium and aluminium alloys, a heat-curable adhesive is applied to the fitting surfaces of the components to be bonded and, in order to effect curing of the adhesive, an outer face - adjacent to the fitting surface - of one component is irradiated with infrared. In this method at least that outer face of the component which is intended for irradiation is provided with a pattern of roughness. By means of the reduction in reflectivity of the roughened surface, its absorption capacity for infrared radiation is increased. A preferred application of the method is in the adhesive bonding of shaped parts, especially bodywork panels in automotive construction.
