Switching device for track in a rail-borne transport system comprising stock
rails (2) and pivotable switch tongues (4), wherein the stock rails (2) are

releasably attached on carrier elements (3) in such a manner as to be non-displaceable
substantially in the direction of the track plane (8) and provided

at least in the region of the tongue ends are contact surfaces (5) for the
switch tongues (4) as they contact the stock rails (2), wherein at least one,

in particular cylindrical, roller (1) comprising a shaft (11) is disposed in the
pivot region and the upper crown (7) of said roller perpendicular to the track

plane (8) lies higher than the corresponding contact surface (5), wherein the
roller (1) lies against the switch tongue (4) below its upper crown (7) when the

switch tongue (4) is in position lying against the stock rail (2) and when not
in this position the switch tongue (4) can be carried by rollers (1) and the

roller (1) is resiliently mounted transverse to the track plane (8) in the
direction transverse to the track plane (8), wherein the roller (1) is disposed

in an adjustable manner both transverse to and also in the direction of the
track plane (8) and its shaft (11) is aligned in the longitudinal direction of the

stock rail (2), 
characterised in that
, the shaft ends (12) of the roller (1) are
disposed in a height-adjustable manner in receiving devices (21) and at least

one receiving device (21) can be held in the direction of the stock rail (2)
directly or indirectly by way of at least one spacer (29) .
Switching device for track according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
receiving device (21) for one shaft end (12) is formed by virtue of a groove

which is aligned in a transverse, in particular perpendicular, manner with
respect to the track plane (8), is open towards the roller (1) and is at least

partially closed in the downwards direction.
Switching device for track according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that

the shaft ends (12) lie in the respective receiving device (21) by way of
intermediate pieces (22). 
Switching device for track according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that

particular four-sided, and lie on the intermediate pieces (22) by way of only
one surface.
Switching device for track according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that
 the intermediate pieces (22) are mutually connected
in an operative manner and comprise projections (23) and recesses (24), in

particular in the form of truncated cones.
Switching device for track according to any one of claims 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 disposed in the receiving device (21) is an adjusting
screw which is upwardly and downwardly adjustable and which supports the

shaft end.
Switching device for track according to any one of claims 1 to 6,

characterised in that
 the receiving devices (21) are provided for at least
one, in particular two, roller(s) in a roller receiving device (9) attached in a

resilient manner on the carrier element(s) (3).
Switching device for track according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the roller receiving device (9) comprising the receiving
devices (21) for at least one roller (1) can be held in a resilient manner in the

direction of the stock rail (2).
Switching device for track according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 the roller receiving device (9) comprising the receiving
devices (21) for at least one roller (1) is attached by way of leaf springs (10)

at the or on the carrier element(s) (3).
Switching device for track according to any one of claims 1 to 9,

characterised in that
 the roller receiving device (9) comprising the receiving 
devices (21) for at least one roller (1) can be held in the direction of the track middle by way of at least one leaf spring (10) which is engaged by a resilient
