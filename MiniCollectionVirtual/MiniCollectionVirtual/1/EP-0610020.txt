<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a metal gate or fencing 
section comprising providing a mold 14a defining a 

decorative profile and positioning the ends of two steel 
tubes (4,6) in a predetermined relative to extend into 

the mold (14a). The mold (14A) is then fitted with 
molten aluminium or aluminium alloy so that the molten 

material envelops those parts of the tubes received by 
the mold and conforms to the decorative profile defined 

by the mold. When the molten material has solidified it 
will lock the tubes in their predetermined relative 

configuration. Thereafter, the solidified material and 
the tubes can be released from the mold.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metal gates and 
fencing and methods of making the same. Heavy metal gates are traditionally used to 
provide access to property. Like-wise heavy metal 
fencing or railings are used to surround property. Such 
gates and fencing have been made out of lengths of steel 
or cast iron bar welded together to form a matrix. For 
example, a series of spaced uprights can be welded to 
upper and lower horizontal bars. To make the gate or 
fencing more attractive, a series of shaped decorative 
profiles such as a spear head or a fleur-de-lys are 
welded at intervals, for example to the upper horizontal 
bar, each profile being aligned with a corresponding 
upright. The method of constructing such gates or fencing 
sections is relative slow. Each upright must be cut 
fairly accurately from a length of stock and welded to 
both upper and lower horizontals. The profiles must 
first either be cast or worked to the desired shape and 
then welded to the upper horizontal bar. It is an object of the invention to provide an 
improved metal gate or fencing section and an improved 
method of manufacture. According to the present invention there is 
provided an array of tubular members in the form of a 
gate or fencing section in which adjoining members are 
coupled together by an aluminium or an aluminium alloy 
casting and in which selected ones of said castings 
include a cast decorative profile. Advantageously, a casting in the form of a hinge 
or other fixing is secured to at least one said tubular 
member. Preferably the tubular members are of mild steel 
and of circular cross-section. Instead, the tubular  
 
members are of square-cross section. Advantageously, the sole means coupling adjacent 
tubular members together is the casting. The aluminium alloy can comprises an aluminium 
silicon alloy. The present invention further provides a method 
of manufacturing a metal gate or fencing section 
comprising providing a mold defining a decorative 
profile, positioning a first elongate steel tube and a 
second elongate steel tube in a predetermined relative 
configuration so that both extend into the mold. Filling 
the mould with molten aluminium or aluminium alloy so 
that the molten material envelops those parts of the 
first and second tube received by the mold and conforms 
to the decorative profile defined by the mould, allowing 
the molten material to solidify to lock the first and 
second tubes in the predetermined relative configuration 
and releasing the solidified material and the

<CLAIMS>
An array of tubular members in the form of a gate 
or fencing section in which adjoining members are coupled 

together by an aluminium or an aluminium alloy casting 
and in which selected ones of said castings include a 

cast decorative profile. 
An array according to Claim 1 including a casting 
in the form of a hinge or other fixing secured to at 

least one said tubular member. 
An array according to Claim 1 or to Claim 2, 
wherein the tubular members are of mild steel and of 

circular cross-section. 
An array according to Claim 1 or to Claim 2 
wherein the tubular members are of square-cross section. 
An array according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the sole means coupling adjacent tubular members 

together is the casting. 
An array according to any preceding claim wherein 
the aluminium alloy comprises an aluminium silicon alloy. 
A method of manufacturing a metal gate or fencing 
section comprising the steps of providing a mold defining 

a decorative profile, positioning a first elongate steel 
tube and a second elongate steel tube in a predetermined 

relative configuration so that both extend into the mold, 
filling the mould with molten aluminium or aluminium 

alloy so that the molten material envelops those parts of 
the first and second tube received by the mold and 

conforms to the decorative profile defined by the mould, 
allowing the molten material to solidify to lock the 

first and second tubes in the predetermined relative 
configuration and releasing the solidified material and 

the tubes from the mold. 
A method according to Claim 7, wherein the tubes 
are positioned within the mold so that the intermediate 

portion of the first tube traverses the mold and an end 
 

portion of the second tube extends into the mold at right 
angles to the first tube, but lies spaced from the first 

tube. 
A method according to Claim 7 or to Claim 8 
including the step of 
providing an array of molds to 
receive an array of tubes and to lock the array of tubes 

together when the molds are filled with the molten 
material. 
A method according to any one of Claims 7 to 9, 
wherein when the tubes are inserted into the mold, they 

are at room temperature so that as the molten material 
solidifies it forms a shrink fit around the tubes.
