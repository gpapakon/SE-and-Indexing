<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an apparatus and its 
method that is able to effectively use positional data such 

as coordinates and so forth stored in advance in a bonder. 
This wire bonder is able to compare and evaluate at 
least one set of image data of either a first bonding point 

or second bonding point in the form of bonded sites, or a 
wire spr
ead between said first and second bonding points, 
with the positional data into which said image data has been 

incorporated in advance, and automatically perform 
inspection and make corrections.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wire bonder, and
more particularly, to a wire bonder and that wire bonding
method equipped with an automatic inspection function for an
electrode (pad) on a semiconductor chip (IC chip), lead and
wire spread between said pad and lead in the assembly
process of a semiconductor device.Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 6, no. 173 (E-129), 07.09.82
and JP-A-57 089 233 disclose a wire bonder and a wire bonding
method which are used for identifying faulty wiring patterns.
A connected pattern (that is, after bonding has been
performed) is photographed for obtaining an image pattern,
and the obtained image pattern is compared with the image of
a standard connection pattern. A semiconductor element has a
bonding pad section. The bonding pad section is connected by
a small metallic wire to a lead using a bonding tool. The
connecting pattern is photographed by a camera for obtaining
an image pattern, and the obtained image pattern is compared
with the image of a standard connection pattern. If the
patterns agree, the product is regarded as a good product,
whereas if the patterns disagree, the
small metallic wire is cut by a cutting
blade of a cutting device. In summary, in the event of a
faulty product the wire of this faulty product is cut.
Therefore, no control or feedback for successive
semiconductor elements is performed.In the assembly process during manufacturing of
semiconductor integrated circuits (IC) and large-scale
integrated circuits (LSI), a first bonding point in the form
of an electrode (pad) on a semiconductor chip (IC chip) and
a second bonding point in the form of a lead are connected
by bonding using gold wire or wire made of copper or
aluminum.This bonder first produces an electrical discharge by
applying a high voltage between the end of a protruding wire
and a discharge electrode (electric torch) from a bonding
tool in the form of a capillary. The end of the wire is
then melted by the energy of that discharge resulting in the  
formation of ball on the end of the wire that has been
inserted into the capillary. By then applying ultrasonic
vibrations while bringing the ball held on the end of the
capillary in contact with an electrode (pad) on a
semiconductor chip, the wire is connected to the bonding
point.In order to confirm whether a wire that has been
automatically bonded by a bonder has been reliably connected
to the pad or lead, or confirm whether the connected wire
has formed a loop on the wire connecting the pad and lead in
the prior art, the bonded lead
