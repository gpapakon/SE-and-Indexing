<ABSTRACT>
An axial-flow pump combined with an electric motor coaxially arranged therearound. The rotor (1) and stator (2) are common to both the electric motor and the pump. The rotor comprises a central tubular portion (11) defining a central channel (14) with a wall (15) provided with blades (16). The blades preferably do not extend as far as the channel axis (3) so that they define a central free area therealong. The outer portion of the rotor (1) has pairs of permanent magnets (24, 25) with stator coils (9) therebetween. The coils are actuated and deactuated by an electronic switching device (28) controlled by sensors (36, 37) for sensing markings on the rotor. The length of the rotor is smaller than its outer diameter. Said pump may be used to pump liquids or gases and drive vehicles, particularly submarines.

High speed electrically driven axial-flow pump comprising

a stator (2) with a sealed casing (8),
a rotor (1) located inside said stator casing so that it can rotate on an axis of
rotation (3), said rotor (1) being provided with


a tubular central portion (11) forming an exterior wall (15) of a
central channel (14) for the continuous axial flow of a liquid, with blades (16)

having the shape of helicoids in said channel,
magnets co-operating with electrical coils (33) on the stator
which are inside said sealed casing (8),

said blades (16) being attached to said exterior wall (15) of the central
channel (14) and do not extending as far as the axis of rotation, so that the

channel has a free central area (17) along its entire length,

characterized in that it is provided with electromagnetic drive means
comprising magnets (24, 25) arranged in pairs and distributed around said

tubular central portion (11), the two magnets of each pair being axially
separated by an interval (23), the coils (33) on the stator (2) being formed of

flattened coils (9) arranged in a circle in a radial plane within said spaces (23)
between the rotor magnets, so that each coil is substantially perpendicular to

the lines of the magnetic field in these intervals, these drive means further
comprising control means consisting of at least one position sensor (35)

attached to the stator and delivering a signal showing the angular position of
the rotor, and electronic switching means (28) designed to individually

actuate and deactuate the stator coils (33) depending upon the signal from
the position sensor or sensors,

in that said rotor (1) is longer in length (L) than its exterior diameter (D), and
in that the blade sweep is smaller than the diameter of the central channel.
A pump according to claim 1, characterized in that said magnets of the
rotor (1) are electromagnets which emit a substantially uniform magnetic field

directed from one electromagnet to the other.
A pump according to claim 1, characterized in that each of said stator
coils (9) is surrounded by a peripheral channel (50) for circulating cooling

fluid. 
A boat driven by pumps according to one of claims 1 to 3, comprising
at least two propulsion channels (62a, 62b) substantially longitudinally

disposed inside the boat (61) and each traversing one of said pumps (60a,
60b), each channel having an inlet at the front of the boat and a longitudinally

directed outlet at the rear of the boat, characterized in that the inlet (63a, 63b)
and the outlet (64a, 64b) of each of the two propulsion channels are situated

on opposite sides of a longitudinal central axis (65) of the boat, respectively.
