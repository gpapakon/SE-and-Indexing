 NEWCYCLODEXTRINSANDNEWFORMULATEDDRUGSCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The subject matter of this application relates to that of PCT Application AU89/0025S, published as WO 90/02141 on 3 March 1990 (hereinafter "the '359 Application"), and PCT Application AU91/00071 filed March 1, 1991 (hereinafter "the '071 application") , the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMany of today's commonly prescribed drugs have undesirable properties or delivery profiles which detract from their efficacy and/or beneficial nature. For example, some drugs may exhibit a poor or unpredictable bioavailability profile, which may be due, in part, to the drug's disadvantageous solubility characteristics. Two examples of such drugs which have a disadvantageous solubilityprofile are Propofol, i.e., 2,6-bis(l- ethylethyl)phenol, and Alfaxalone, i.e., 3-hydroxypregnane- 11,20-dione, which are well-known anesthetics. Indeed, those drugs might find increased usage if their solubility profiles were improved..Accordingly, there is a continuing need • for new drug delivery systems for Propofol and Alfaxalone and pharmacologically active derivatives or metabolites thereof.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide inclusion complexes and pharmaceutical compositions comprising Propofol or Alfaxalone with substituted or unsubstituted cyclodextrins.It is another object of this invention to provide methods for increasing the solubility, stability and/or bioavailability of Propofol and Alfaxalone.It is yet another object of this invention to provide methods for treating mammals in need of such treatment with therapeutically effective amounts of the

compositions.Accordingly, embodiments of this invention provide inclusion complexes and pharmaceu—ical compositions comprising Propofol or Alfaxalone or a pharmacologically active derivative or metabolite thereof included in a substituted or unsubstituted cyclodextrin or salt thereof.Another embodiment provides methods for increasing the solubility of Propofol or Alfaxalone or a derivative or metabolite thereof in a neutral or acidic aqueous solution, comprising the step of forming one of the above-described inclusion complexes.Another embodiment of this invention provides a method for improving the bioavailability. of Propofo or Alfaxalone or a derivative or metabolite thereof in a host mammal comprising the step of forming one of the above-described inclusion complexes.Another embodiment, provides a method
