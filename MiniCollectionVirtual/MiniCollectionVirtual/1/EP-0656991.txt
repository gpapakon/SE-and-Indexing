<ABSTRACT>
An inlet pipe assembly for a multiple cylinder internal combustion engine, in particular with two cylinder rows in a V-shaped configuration, has a tubular inlet distributor (2) from which start first individual inlet pipes (4 to 9) which curve around the inlet distributor and lead to the individual cylinders of both cylinder rows. Second, shorter individual inlet pipes also start in the inlet distributor and open into the corresponding individual inlet pipes. The inlet distributor and the first and second individual inlet pipes are formed by a single cast part (1) having a longitudinal bore (16) which intersects the second individual inlet pipes for the cylinders of a cylinder row. In each longitudinal bore (16) is inserted a supporting body (15) provided with passages (17) aligned with the second individual inlet pipes. In each passage is arranged a swivelling valve (14) on a common shaft (20) mounted in the supporting body (15).

Inlet pipe assembly for a multiple cylinder internal 
combustion engine, comprising 


an inlet distributor (2) 
individual inlet pipes (4 to 9) arranged alongside 
one another, starting in the inlet distributor and 

each running to one cylinder 
shorter second individual inlet pipes (12), 
starting in the inlet distributor (2) and each 

opening out into a first individual pipe, and 
swivelling valves (14) for shutting off or opening 
up the second individual inlet pipes, 
 
characterised in that
 
the inlet distributor (2) and the first and second 

individual inlet pipes (6 to 9 and 12, respectively) 
are formed by a single cast part (1) incorporating a 

longitudinal bore (16) which intersects the second 
individual inlet pipes (12), and that set into this 

longitudinal bore is a supporting body (15) which 
incorporates a central through-bore (19) and passages 

(17) aligned with the second individual inlet pipes 
(12), there being arranged in each of the said 

passages (17) a swivelling valve (14) which is 
mounted on a shaft (20) passing through the through-bore 

(19). 
Inlet pipe assembly according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the inlet distributor (2) is 

tubular, that the first individual inlet pipes (4 to 
9) curve in an arc of more than 270Â° around the inlet 

distributor, that every other individual inlet pipe 
(12) runs parallel to the associated first individual 

inlet pipe, radially within the latter, and shares a 
common wall (13) therewith and opens out into the  

 
first individual inlet pipe, close to the cylinder-side 

end thereof. 
Inlet pipe assembly according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the longitudinal bore (16) 

intersects the second individual inlet pipes (12) 
close to where they open out into the first 

individual inlet pipes. 
Inlet pipe assembly according to claims 1 and 2 for 
an internal combustion engine having two rows of 

cylinders in a V-shaped configurarion, characterised 
in that the individual inlet pipes allocated to the 

cylinders of the first cylinder row extend in a 
clockwise direction and the individual inlet pipes 

allocated to the cylinders of the second cylinder row 
extend in an anti-clockwise direction around the 

inlet distributor (2), and in the longitudinal 
direction of the inlet distributor a first and second 

individual inlet pipe for a cylinder of the first 
cylinder row respectively follow a first and second 

individual inlet pipe for a cylinder of the second 
cylinder row, and that there are provided a first 

longitudinal bore (16) intersecting the second 
individual inlet pipes for the cylinders of the first 

cylinder row and a second longitudinal bore (12) 
intersecting the second individual inlet pipes (12) 

for the cylinders of the second cylinder row, into 
which second longitudinal bore (12) there are 

respectively set a supporting body (15) with passages 
(17) and set therein swivelling valves (14) mounted 

on a shaft (20), and that the two shafts (20) are 
joined together so as to rotate jointly. 
Inlet pipe assembly according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the sections (24) of the cast 

part (1) which contain the longitudinal bores (16)  
 

are discontinuous between adjacent second individual 
inlet pipes (12), and that each supporting body (15) 

has a smaller cross-section in the region of these 
breaks (26) than in the regions in which the passages 

(17) are provided with the swivelling valves (14).
