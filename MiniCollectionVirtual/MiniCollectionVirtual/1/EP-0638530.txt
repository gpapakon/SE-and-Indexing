<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for bonding 
graphite (1) to metal (3) includes a step of brazing the graphite (1 

) to the metal (3) with an active alloy brazing material (2), 
characterized by the step of forming a layer (1a) on a surface of 

the graphite (1) before bonding the graphite (1) to the metal (3), 
the layer (1a) being composed of a carbide of a metal (3) to be 

bonded to the graphite (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for bonding graphite to 
metal, and more particularly to such a method using an active alloy 
brazing process. The graphite or black lead has various superior properties, for 
instance, high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion 
coefficient, low secondary electron emission coefficient and high 
emissivity. Thus, it has been researched so far to apply the graphite, 
for instance, to walls of a plasma container for a nuclear fusion 
reactor, a collector electrode of an electron tube, and capillaries of an 
ion laser tube. In these applications, a member made of graphite is 
supported by or secured to other members made of material other than 
graphite, in almost all cases, metal, by any means. When high 
mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity are required for 
such support and securing, a brazing process is usually chosen. As is understood from the fact that the graphite is suitable 
for walls of a metal fusion furnace and a crucible, the graphite has 
inherent property of not reacting on molten metal. However, the 
graphite reacts on an active metal such as Ti, Zr, Ta and Mo at a 
temperature over 1,000 degrees centigrade, and thus forms a layer 
composed of a carbide of these metals at an interface thereof, to 
thereby firmly bond with the metal. For instance, 
JP-A-62-21768 published on January 30, 1987 teaches that graphite 
can be bonded to Mo or Ni-Cr-Fe alloy including Mo by more than 8% in 
an inert gas atmosphere, for instance, under heat treatment at a 
temperature of 1,400 degrees centigrade for 90 hours. JP-A-63-310778  
 
published on December 19, 1988 discloses a process in which a surface 
of a member composed of graphite is first metalized with active 
brazing alloy having Ti-Cu-Ag structure, and then brazed with brazing 
alloy such as Ag, Au and Ni, to thereby form a stress relaxation layer 
for bonding the graphite to metal. In the aforementioned brazing processes in which an active 
alloy brazing material is to be used, since the active alloy reacts on 
and thereby bonds to the graphite only within contact area of each 
other, it is necessary for bonding to apply to the contact area 
sufficient pressure, for instance, in the range of 200 grams per square 
centimeter or more and also temperature of approximately 1,000 
degrees centigrade. In addition, since the reaction develops at 
relatively slow speed under the high temperature, it takes relatively 
long time for brazing. This increases probability of coarsening of 
crystal grains
