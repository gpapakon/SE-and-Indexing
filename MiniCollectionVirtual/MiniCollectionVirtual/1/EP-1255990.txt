<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE DEBRIS PARTICULATE CHARACTERIZATION IN LUBRICANTSThe present invention relates to an apparatus and method for measuring a particulate characteristic of a particulate-containing fluid, in particular for monitoring the particulate content of lubricating or hydraulic fluids in a mechanical system in order to diagnose component failure.In many industries (in particular the aircraft industry) , the need to diagnose impending mechanical failure is paramount. Currently, lubricating fluids may be tested for chemical or physical indicators of engine stress such as expenditure of additives, presence of water or changes in the concentration of metal particles. Analysis of wear debris in lubricating fluid and of the chemical properties of the fluid are normally carried out periodically (eg during routine maintenance) .Techniques commonly used to detect changes in the characteristics of wear particles include ferrography, emission spectroscopy, magnetic chip detection, x-ray fluorescence, ultra-sonic reflectomerty and particle size analysis. Although in-line monitors such as magnetic chip detectors are in widespread use, these are generally inadequate as they are insensitive to particles smaller than a few hundred micrometers and therefore are unable to reliably monitor lubricating fluids in real time.Particle size distribution analysis is usually performed by taking a sample of the fluid (eg oil) and passing it through a filter of known size. By either monitoring the flow rate across the filter or by tracking the pressure drop across it, it is possible to determine the particle size distribution in the fluid. An example of such a system is disclosed in US-A-5095740. 

 In practice, measurements of particle size distribution are conducted on a re-gular basis on conventional hydraulic systems. However the determination of particle size distribution is a labour intensive activity and therefore is in general only performed periodically. For example, particle size distribution may be measured on a monthly basis and preventative measures taken as and when the oil quality data indicates that action is required. However, with measurements conducted so infrequently, there exists the real possibility of serious mechanical failure in the interim period.US-A-5754055 describes a method for determining the quality of hydraulic oil by interrogating a resonator cavity at microwave frequencies. By measuring the microwave resonant frequency and "quality factor" (a measure of the sharpness of the resonant
