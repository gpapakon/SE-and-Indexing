<ABSTRACT>
A device for electrophoretic separation of complex fluid substance mixtures has a channel system (21, 2, 22) for a support medium (C), an injection device (3) for injecting a substance mixture (S) to be separated into the support medium (C) and a separating path (2) for separating the substance mixture (S) in an electric field applied along the separation path (2). Downstream of the injection device (3) for the substance mixture (S) to be separated, a second separation path (4), for further separation of the substance mixture (S) in an electric field applied along the second separation path (4) is provided at a distance from the injection device. The second separation path (4) is arranged inclined at an angle ( alpha ) with respect to the first separation path (2). The intersection region of the first separation path (2) and the second separation path (4) forms a second injection device (5) for injecting the partially separated substance mixture (S) into a second support medium (E). The fluid substance mixture (S) is injected in the first injection device (3) into the support medium (C) and subsequently separated in the electric field which is applied along the first separation path (2). Thereupon the partially separated substance mixture (S) is injected downstream of the first separation path (2) into the second support medium (E) and further separated into its components in the electric field applied along the second separation path (4).
