<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a toilet, in particular a portable toilet for boats, caravans or mobile homes, having a bowl-like seat part exhibiting a discharge opening, having a container with flushing water for flushing out the seat part, which can be emptied through a discharge opening, and having a receiving container located beneath the seat part. The toilet exhibits a regulating means for a device which can be connected to the flushing-water container or the seat part and is intended for delivering the flushing water out of the flushing-water container into the seat part. For the purpose of simpler and more reliable handling of the pumping device (1), the latter is intended to be designed as a piston pump (6) having a plurality of chambers (7, 8), of which a first chamber (7) is connected to the flushing-water container (4) and the seat part and to a second chamber (8).
