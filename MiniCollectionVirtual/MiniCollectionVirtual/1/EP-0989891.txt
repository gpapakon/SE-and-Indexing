<ABSTRACT>
A hand-held puzzle comprising a planar, square array of mirror surface tiles (2) confined for sequential planar movement via a ninth, vacant, tile size space or recess (3) to alter the positions of individual blocks in the array. A humanoid character (4) molded in one piece from elastomeric material has hands (5) and feet (6) anchored to preselected respective corner tiles (2) by adhesive so that the limbs (7, 8) and torso (9) can be twisted, intertwined and contorted into stable different configurations by such sequential movement of respective tiles. The character's body is marked with black and white stripes which extend in straight manner along the limbs and torso when the body is undeformed enabling the direction of distortion of the limbs and body to be more readily perceived by a player.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Amusement Device of Shifting Block Type.Field of The InventionThe invention relates to an amusement device of a shifting block type.Background of The InventionAmusement devices of the shifting block type have been in widespread use for more than one hundred years more than fifty years. In one form of such puzzles, a series of tiles are confined in a generally two dimensional array by a frame so as to permit sequential lateral coplanar movement of selected individual tiles within the frame to change the array typically to reorder a sequence of numbers or letters marked on the exposed surface of the tiles or to change a pattern or picture depicted by the tiles.Examples of the very numerous puzzles of the type described above are taught by patent 1 ,101 ,567 issued to Ridgway in 1914; 4,422,641 issued to Collin in 1983; 4,548,410 issued to Morrone in 1985 and 5,267,723 issued to Bowen in 1993, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.Summary of The InventionIt is an object of the invention to utilizes the two dimensional movement to change the shape of a three dimensional object upstanding from the tiles thereby providing an entirely new and amusing visual effect or a puzzle of increased complexity.According to one aspect of the invention, in amusement device of a shifting block type in which a series of blocks are confined in a two dimensional array on a base for sequential coplanar movement of selected individual tiles to different stable positions to change the array, the improvement comprises a body supported upstanding from the blocks by flexible appendages having respective 

free ends anchored to predetermined respective blocks for movement therewith reversibly to one of alter positions, twist and intertwine the appendages.A player solves the puzzle by moving the blocks sequentially to untwist, twist, intertwine or unravel the appendages to obtain a selected body shape or position.The body may be a recognizable animal character such as a humanoid having limbs, such as arms and legs which form the appendages.Instructions can be provided with the device to release a twisted or contorted character from the bondage of a deformed state.The free ends of the limbs can be anchored to the tiles by releasable anchoring means to permit release thereof from respective tiles to permit unrestricted movement of the body to restore the body to a former shape, when the puzzle cannot be solved by a player.Desirably, the body is molded in one piece from an elastomeric material.Brief description

CLAIM
1. An amusement device of a shifting block type comprising a base in which a series of blocks are confined in a two dimensional array for sequential movement of selected individual blocks to different stable positions to change the array, the improvement comprising a body including flexible appendages having respective free ends anchored to predetermined respective blocks thereby supporting the body upstanding from the blocks for movement therewith reversibly to one of alter positions of, twist and intertwine appendages.
2. An amusement device according to claim 1 , wherein the body is one of a recognizable animal character having limbs which form at least some of the appendages.
3. An amusement device according to claim 2, wherein the character is a humanoid and the limbs are arms and legs.
4. An amusement device according to claim 2, wherein the free ends of the limbs are anchored to the respective tiles by adhesive.
5. An amusement device according to claim 1 , wherein the body is molded in one piece from an elastomeric material.
6. An amusement device according to claim 4, wherein the body is molded in one piece from an elastomeric material.
7. An amusement device according to claim 1 , wherein the body has different locations marked with contrasting colors for enabling distortion of the 


body by block movement to be more readily perceived.
8. An amusement device according to claim 6, wherein the body has different locations marked with contrasting colors for enabling a degree of distortion of the body by block movement to be more readily perceived.
9. An amusement device according to claim 1 , wherein the blocks have exposed mirror surfaces.
10. An amusement device according to claim 7, wherein the blocks have exposed mirror surfaces.
11. An amusement device according to claim 7, wherein the contrasting colors are applied to obtain a striped effect.
12. An amusement device according to claim 8, wherein the contrasting colors are applied to obtain a striped effect.
