<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heating device for 
dielectric materials employing a radio-frequency electric 
field. In particular, such a device can be used for drying 
or heat-treating processes applied to thin dielectric 
materials, such as materials in the form of a plate, sheet 
or ribbon. The device may be advantageously used for 
drying or heat-treating foodstuffs too. The advantages resulting from drying or heat-treating 
dielectric materials through the use of radio-frequency 
fields are well known in the art. The most typical 
applications are for example heat-treatment and/or drying 
of paper, paperboard, fabrics, carpets, hide, leather, 
rubber, plywood, wood and/or plastics laminate, textile 
yarn in the form of reels or skeins, plastic material, 
latex, loose or packaged foodstuffs, etc. In radio-frequency heating plants, electrodes are 
generally present which are connected to a radio-frequency 
voltage generator to generate an electric field in the 
space occupied by the material to be treated. Obviously, 
the heating rate and amount depend on the power absorbed 
by the material and therefore the concentration of the 
electric field inside it. For items having a fair three-dimensional extension, for 
example blocks of material, reels of yarn, etc., it is 
relatively easy to achieve high electric fields internal 
to the material, by merely placing the material between  
 
two flat electrodes parallel to each other. On the contrary, the achievement of satisfactory 
concentrations becomes problematic in the case of foil 
elements, that is substantially two-dimensional items 
having a thickness smaller than the other dimensions. In 
such cases the absorbed power can be increased for example 
by increasing voltage between the electrodes, but this 
fact involves the risk of electric discharges between the 
electrodes and between the latter and the material, which 
will damage the material. Even in the case of "three-dimensional" items, the use of 
known R.F. applying devices often gives rise to problems 
in terms of evenness of treatment resulting in 
non-homogeneous heatings, or, which is worse, localized 
burnings. In an attempt to improve the features of the electric 
field, different electrode structures have been proposed. 
For example, electrodes made of a plurality of parallel 
tubes disposed alternately on either side of the material 
and connected to the generator have been proposed, such 
that the tubes on one side of the material have a 
potential different from the potential of
