<ABSTRACT>
A retainer 16 is temporarily coupled to an inlet port 
of a connector chamber 7 in a housing 5 so that the retainer 

cannot come out of the chamber 7. A terminal metal fixture 
1 is inserted into the housing 5 through an opening formed 

in a rear wall of the housing in an axial direction of 
a bulb holding chamber 6. Then, the retainer 16 which is 

temporarily coupled to the chamber 7 is pushed into the 
connector chamber which receiving coupling pieces 3 of the 

fixtures 1 in holding apertures 17 in the retainer 17. When 
the retainer 16 reaches an inner section in the chamber 7, 

a lock projection 18 on the retainer engages with a lock 
face 14 in a longitudinal slot 12 formed in the rear wall of 

the housing 5, thereby bringing the retainer into a regular 
coupling position. Proximal ends of the coupling pieces 3, 

which is arranged perpendicularly to an inserting direction 
of the fixtures 1, are fitted in the holding apertures 17 

in the retainer 16 which is secured in the housing 5. The 
retainer 16 is provided on its inner face of a side plate 

28 with a guide slant face 281 a lower end of which is 
contiguous to rear end edges of the apertures 17. The 

apertures 17 are provided on their front, right and left 
end edges with guide slant faces 26. After the fixtures 1 

are inserted into the housing 5 from its rear side, the 
retainer is pushed into the connector chamber 7 through the 

inlet port of the chamber 7. If the fixtures 1 are shifted, 
the fixtures 1 are corrected in position while the distal 

ends of the coupling pieces 3 contact with the guide slant 
faces 281 or 26 to insert them into the apertures 17. The 

retainer 16 is secured in the housing 5 when it reaches 
the inner section of the chamber 7.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an L-shaped bulb socket
in which a bulb and a mating connector are perpendicularly
interconnected.Heretofore, for example, a light device for an
automobile has utilized an L-shaped bulb socket, which
accommodates terminal metal fixtures having a pair of bulb
receiving pieces adapted to hold each terminal of a bulb and
a coupling piece adapted to be connected to each terminal
of a mating connector and joined perpendicularly to the bulb
receiving pieces and in which the bulb and mating connector
are interconnected perpendicularly.Such a conventional L-shaped bulb socket is generally
made by insert-molding the terminal metal fixtures.
However, a process of producing the socket requires much
labor. Thus, a method of assembling the socket has been
developed. An example thereof is disclosed in Japanese
Utility Model Publication No. 62-137588 (1987).For convenience of explanation, a conventional
L-shaped bulb socket will be described below by referring to
FIGS. 7 and 8. FIG. 7 is a longitudinal sectional view of
the conventional L-shaped bulb socket and FIG. 8 is a front
elevational view taken along lines VIII-VIII in FIG. 7.As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the L-shaped bulb socket
is provided in its L-shaped housing a with a bulb holding
chamber b and a connector chamber c arranged perpendicularly
to the bulb holding chamber b. The housing a is provided
in its front portion with slots d which extend from the
bulb holding chamber b to the connector chamber c. Terminal
metal fixtures e are pushed into the housing a through the
slots d. When an elastic lock piece g projected from a side
face of bulb receiving portions b of each terminal metal
fixture e engages with a recess h formed in a side wall of
the bulb holding chamber b, the fixture e is secured in the
housing a. However, since the conventional L-shaped bulb socket
prevents the terminal metal fixture e from coming out of
the housing a by a projection and recess fitting mechanism
on a plane along a inserting direction of the terminal metal
fixture e, the fixture e easily vibrates in the inserting
direction in the housing a and easily falls down out of
the housing a. Consequently, for example, when the bulb
is attached to the socket, a distance from the distal end
of the socket to a filament in the bulb is changed in each
socket.Also, a substantial resistance will occur when the
elastic lock pieces g of the terminal metal fixture e is
pushed into the housing a while being elastically deformed.
This will result in a half insertion of the
