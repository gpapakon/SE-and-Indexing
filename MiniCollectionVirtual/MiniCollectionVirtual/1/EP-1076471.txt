<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a full-mesh optical wavelength division multiplexing transmission network device which is capable of exhibiting excellent communication quality and being mass produced, by reducing the accumulation number of coherent crosstalk lights, without any modification of constituent components constituting the conventional one. In the full-mesh optical wavelength division multiplexing transmission network device, provided is an N×N wavelength multi/demultiplexer having a periodic wavelength demultiplexing property in input/output combination, which performs input/output from/to first and second I/O port groups for optical signals and allows lightwaves traveling in opposite directions not to interfere with each other within the circuit, thus reducing the accumulation number of coherent crosstalk lights in WDM wavelength lights and improving S/N of a received light. Particularly, by preventing the accumulation of adjacent crosstalk lights, communications with higher quality can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a full-mesh optical wavelength division multiplexing
transmission network transmission device for transmitting a plurality of optical signals wavelength-division
multiplexed among a plurality of transmitting and receiving apparatuses.This specification is based on Japanese Patent Application (No. 11(1999)-229174) to
Japan Patent Office, and contents described in this Japanese Patent Application will be incorporated
as a part of this specification.An optical wavelength division multiplexinging (WDM) transmission system, which
transmits a plurality of optical signals on one optical fiber by allocating the signals to different
wavelengths, can increase significantly the capacity of its transmission path. In addition, the optical
WDM transmission system can perform wavelength addressing which is capable of allocating the
destination information relating to the optical signals to the respective wavelengths. Furthermore, a
star-type WDM system, in which an N × N wavelength multi/demultiplexer having a periodic
wavelength demultiplexing property in input/output combination is arranged in the center so as to
connect N transmitting and receiving apparatuses therebetween, can realize a full-mesh WDM
transmission network device capable of interconnecting the apparatus through independent N × N
signal paths by using only N wavelengths optical signals.Fig. 25 is a block diagram for explaining a schematic constitution of a conventional full-mesh
WDM transmission network device. Referring to Fig. 25, reference numerals 1 to 4 denote 
transmitting and receiving apparatuses; 5 to 8, transmitters for sending WDM signals (wavelength
λK: K = 1,2,..., N); 9 to 12, receivers for receiving the WDM signals (wavelength λK : K = 1,
2 N); 13 to 16, 1 × N wavelength multiplexers for multiplexing optical signals having different
N wavelengths onto one optical fiber, 17 to 20, 1 × N wavelength demultiplexing circuits for
demultiplexing the WDM signals wavelength-multiplexed on one optical fiber, into signals having
N wavelengths; 21, an N × N wavelength multi/demultiplexer having a periodic wavelength
demultiplexing property in input/output combination, which has a first I/O port group (1, 2,...., N
on the left side) composed of N ports and the opposing second I/O port group (1, 2,...., N on the
right side) composed of N ports; and 22 to 29, optical fibers for optically connecting the transmitting
and receiving apparatuses 1 to 4, to the I/O ports of the N × N wavelength multi/demultiplexer 21.
