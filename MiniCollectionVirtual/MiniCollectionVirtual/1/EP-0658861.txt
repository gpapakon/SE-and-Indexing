<ABSTRACT>
A method for operating a franking machine, in which the franking machine is used jointly by several users, is described. Each user is assigned at least one printing block (10, 12, 14) which has at least one marking identifying the particular user. Information on the marking is fed to a control (16). The control (16) compares the information with the marking and, if they correspond, automatically assigns the printing block (K4) to the particular user.

<CLAIMS>
Method for operating a franking machine, in
which the franking machine is used jointly by a

plurality of users,

wherein at least one printing block (10, 12, 14)
is associated with each user,
the printing block (10, 12, 14) has at least one
identifying marking which identifies the respective

user and is to be printed onto the postal item together
with the printing block,
information on this identifying marking is fed to
a controller (16),
and wherein the controller (16) compares the
information with the identifying marking and in the

case of correspondence the printing block (K4) is
automatically associated with the respective user,
with the comparison of the information and the
identifying marking being effected with the aid of

pixel data of the advertising printing block stored in
a memory (24).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the information is fed to the controller (16)

externally, preferably by way of the keypad (30) of the
franking machine.
Method according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that if at least one printing block
(10, 12, 14) is already present that is associated with

a certain user, the latter's identifying marking is
used as the information.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that at least a portion of the

name, the company slogan or the company logo of the 
respective user is used as the information.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the comparison of the

information and the identifying marking is effected
with the aid of the pixel data which is stored in the

memory (24) and which is arranged as a pixel matrix in
accordance with the printing block to be printed.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the pixel data is cross-correlated

for the purposes of comparison and in that
the association is effected as a function of the

correlation factor which has been determined.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that dark and/or light pixels

of the pixel data are used for the purposes of
comparison at given corresponding positions in the

printing block.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the comparison is carried

out with the aid of text elements.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the format size of the

text or a pixel is determined with the aid of symbol
elements established in the printing block, and in that

the information or the identifying markings of the
printing blocks are compared on the basis of being of

identical format size.
Method according to claim 9, characterised in
that in the case of a different format size the pixel

data of the information or of the identifying marking 
of a printing block are made to undergo a change in

size and subsequently the comparison of the information

or of the identifying markings of the printing blocks
is carried out, in which case preferably a number of

changes in size are carried out with factors relating
to changes in size that are changed stepwise.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the printing blocks are

set up in lines or columns and in that the comparison
is effected printing-block line by printing-block line

or printing-block column by printing-block column.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a given length of a line

or column of successive pixels is used for the purposes
of comparison.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that in the case of line-wise

or column-wise comparison the extent of correspondence
in the lines or columns is determined and in that if a

given value is exceeded the comparison is aborted and
the association is effected.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it is carried out once

when a new printing block is inserted into the franking
machine and in that this printing block is fixedly

associated with an operating element by which it can be
activated.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that it is carried out at the

beginning of each activation of the printing block by
the user. 
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the franking machine

contains a register set (GR1, GR2, GR3) for each user,
in which data relevant to charges is stored, and in

that access to the register set (GR1, GR2, GR3) is
effected as a function of the association of the

printing block that is carried out.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that at least one printing

block is associated with each user at the factory.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that in the absence of

correspondence of the identifying marking of the
printing block and the information or the identifying

marking of at least one of the printing blocks present
an error signal is produced.
