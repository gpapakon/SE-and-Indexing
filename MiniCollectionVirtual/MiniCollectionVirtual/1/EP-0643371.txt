<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to methods which make it possible to modify the face value of a payment card while irreversibly decrementing the payment units contained in this card. It consists in using a counter (M) which is incremented (or decremented) up to a limit value corresponding to the face value of the card. This limit value is not fixed but is determined by a pointer (V) whose value can be altered on the basis of an outside event. The value of the card is exhausted when the contents of the counter are equal to the value of the pointer. It makes it possible to manufacture an IC payment card which can be used for a gaming machine in which points can be won which increase the face value of the card.

<CLAIMS>
A method of electronic payment for a gaming 
machine using a medium for an integrated circuit of the 

chip card type, having a memory acting as an incremental 
counter which is incremented in irreversible steps, each 

corresponding to a unit of payment, until a threshold 
value corresponding to the face value of the medium is 

reached, wherein a pointer (V) is used to determine this 
threshold value and the counter ceases to be incremented 

when the status thereof is equal to the status of the 
pointer, in which the face value of the medium is 

increased without having to remove the medium, in which 
the pointer value (V) is moved in the gaming machine and 

this movement is triggered by a random event 
corresponding to a payment of winnings. 
A method of electronic payment as claimed in 
claim 1, characterised in that the memory initially has 

two zones, a zone of consumable units corresponding to 
the face value of the card and a zone of potentially 

consumable units, the border between the two zones being 
determined by the pointer. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that a single memory (C1 - C4096) is 

used, one part (C8 - C4096) of which forms the said 
counter and the other part (C1) of which allows the value 

of the said pointer to be stored. 
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that the part forming the said counter (C8 - C4096) is 

organised in the form of an abacus memory. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,  
 

characterised in that a chip card containing a memory 
which incorporates the said counter (M) and the said 

pointer (V) is used.
