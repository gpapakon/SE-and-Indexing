<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a process for producing with 
industrially good efficiency a polyester having a high 

melting point and biodegradability. In this process, ring-opening 
copolymerization of a cyclic acid anhydride 

containing succinic anhydride as a main component with a 
cyclic ether containing ethylene oxide as a main component 

is carried out in the presence of a catalyst by introducing 
successively the cyclic ether into a reaction vessel 

containing the cyclic acid anhydride in a melting state or 
solution state. The rate per hour of introducing the 

cyclic ether is within the range of 3 to 90 parts by weight 
per 100 parts by weight of the cyclic acid anhydride, and 

the reaction vessel has an inside pressure within the range 
of atmospheric pressure to 50 kgf/cm² as a gauge pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a polyester. More particularly, the invention
relates to a process for producing a polyester, comprising a
step of performing a ring-opening copolymerization reaction
of a cyclic acid anhydride containing succinic anhydride as
a main component with a cyclic ether containing ethylene
oxide as a main component.An aliphatic polyester has biodegradability and is
used for a packing material and the like by combining one
or more kinds of additives with the polyester to mould the
resulting composition into a sheet or film shape. As a
process for producing such a polyester, there is generally
performed a process comprising esterifying directly a
dicarboxylic acid and a glycol or performing a
transesterification reaction between an alkyl ester of a
dicarboxylic acid and a glycol to produce a glycol ester
and/or an oligomer thereof and then heating the glycol
ester and/or oligomer thereof with stirring under a high
vacuum for a long period of time to perform a
polycondensation reaction.However, the process, which comprises performing a 
polycondensation reaction by heating with stirring under a
high vacuum for a long period of time, needs a vacuum
apparatus and high power to maintain a high vacuum.
Therefore, efficiency is not industrially good.Japanese Official Patent Gazette No. Showa 42-26708
has proposed a process for producing a polyester without
using the vacuum apparatus and high power to maintain a
high vacuum. The proposed process for producing a
polyester comprises performing a copolymerization reaction
of an alkylene oxide with a cyclic acid anhydride by using
a catalyst system comprising as one component an organic
compound of a metal selected from groups I to III in a
periodic law table to form a polyester. In Examples 1 to 6
of the Gazette, an alkylene oxide, a cyclic acid anhydride,
a solvent and a catalyst are placed and dissolved in a
polymerization tube (a tube for polymerization), this tube
is sealed, and a copolymerization reaction is performed in
the sealed tube at 80°C (Examples 1 to 4 and 6) or 30°C
(Example 5). An inside pressure of the sealed tube is
higher than atmospheric pressure owing to a nitrogen gas and
vapor of the solvent. The alkylene oxides used are
epichlorohydrin in Examples 1 to 3 and propylene oxide in
Examples 4 to 6. The cyclic acid anhydrides used are
phthalic anhydride in Examples 1 to 4, endo-cis-bicyclo(2,2,1)-5-heptene-2,3-dicarboxylic
anhydride in 
Example 5, and succinic anhydride in Example 6. The
catalysts
