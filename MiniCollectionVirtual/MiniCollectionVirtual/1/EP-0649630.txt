<ABSTRACT>
An endoscopic surgical stapling apparatus 10 is 
disclosed. The apparatus comprises a frame 12 and a 

generally elongate endoscopic section 14 connected to the 
frame and extending distally therefrom. The endoscopic 

section includes a mechanism 16 for storing a plurality of 
staples, a mechanism 26 for advancing the staples for 

positioning adjacent body tissue and a mechanism for at 
least partially closing each staple. A low pressure 

pneumatic system 58 disposed in the frame provides the 
forces to at least partially activate the staple advancing 

mechanism. The apparatus has particular application in 
attaching mesh to body tissue as in laparoscopic hernia 

repair.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and 
method for applying surgical staples to body tissue. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a laparoscopic or 
endoscopic surgical stapling apparatus which is at least 
partially powered by a low pressure pneumatic system. In laparoscopic procedures, surgery is performed 
in the interior of the abdomen through a small incision. 
In endoscopic procedures, surgery is performed in any 
hollow viscus of the body through narrow endoscopic tubes 
inserted through small entrance wounds in the skin. 
Laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures generally require 
that any instrumentation inserted into the body be sealed, 
i.e., provisions must be made to ensure that gases do not 
enter or exit the body through the laparoscopic or 
endoscopic incision as, for example, in surgical procedures 
in which the surgical region is insufflated. Moreover, 
laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures often require the 
surgeon to act on organs, tissues and vessels far removed 
from the incision, thereby requiring that any instruments 
being used in such procedures be long and narrow while 
being functionally controllable from one end of the 
instrument, i.e. the proximal end. Examples of surgical instruments having 
laparoscopic and/or endoscopic application are disclosed in 
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,040,715 to Green et 
al., 5,071,430 to de Salis et al., 5,084,057 to Green et 
al. and 5,100,420 to Green et al.. The instrument 
disclosed in the '715 patent to Green et al. is adapted to  
 
place one or more rows of staples endoscopically to perform 
gastrointestinal anastomosis. The instrument disclosed in 
the '430 patent to de Salis et al. endoscopically drives 
fasteners into body tissue for ablation of organs. The 
instruments disclosed in the '057 and '420 patents to Green 
et al. are adapted to surgically apply clips to body tissue 
in endoscopic procedures. While the above developments represent major 
advances in endoscopic and laparoscopic instrumentation, 
the present invention is directed to further improvements 
whereby the handle section incorporates a pneumatic system 
to alleviate the degree of manually applied force required 
to actuate the instrument. Surgical instruments having handle mechanisms 
which incorporate pneumatic systems or self contained 
powered units are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,618,842, 
3,643,851, 3,662,939, 3,717,294, 3,815,476 and 3,837,555. 
Typically, the pneumatic system in these instruments 
include a replaceable

<CLAIMS>
An endoscopic surgical stapling apparatus, 
which comprises: 


a) a handle adapted to be gripped by hand; 
b) an elongate tubular portion connected to said 
handle and extending distally from said handle, said 

endoscopic section including: 

i) means for storing at least one 
surgical staple; 
ii) a staple pusher for individually 
advancing said at least one staple distally for positioning 

adjacent the body tissue; and 
iii) an anvil for closing at least one 
staple; 
c) said handle including: 

i) a pneumatic system including a supply 
of low pressure gas and adapted to convert said low 

pressure gas into a force to distally advance said staple 
pusher to close said staple about said anvil; 
ii) first means for distally advancing 
said stapler pusher from an initial position to a first 

predetermined position; 
iii) second means for distally advancing 
said staple pusher beyond said first predetermined position 

to a second position wherein said staple is substantially 
closed about said anvil; and 
iv) at least one of said first and second 
means being operatively connected to said pneumatic system. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein 
actuating means is provided for selectively activating said 

first and second means. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said 
actuating means comprises an actuating button whereby 

movement of said actuating button a first distance 
activates said first means and whereby movement of said 

 
actuating button a second distance activates said second 

means. 
Apparatus according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein both said first and second means 

are operatively connected to said pneumatic system. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
second advancing means is operatively connected to said 

pneumatic system and said first means is manually operated 
by a trigger mechanism or a lever mechanism. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
second advancing means is manually operated by an actuating 

mechanism, wherein said actuating mechanism is pivotally 
mounted to said frame and operatively connected to a firing 

link of said second advancing means, said firing link 
engageable with said piston of said pneumatic means, 

whereby movement of said activating mechanism in one 
direction causes distal longitudinal movement of said 

firing link and corresponding distal movement of said 
piston to thereby cause release of the pressurized gas from 

said gas supply. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
claims further comprising means for providing a perceptible 

tactile indicator to the user when said staple pusher has 
been advanced to said first position. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
claims, further comprising means for sealing said 

endoscopic portion. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
claims wherein said pneumatic system comprises a 

pressurized gas supply and pneumatic actuator means 
including a cylinder in fluid communication with said 

 
pressurized gas 
supply and defining an opening at a distal 
end thereof, and a piston disposed within said opening and 

adapted to advance in response to admission of gas 
therewithin. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
claims wherein engaging means is provided to selectively 

prevent said staple pusher from advancing beyond said first 
predetermined position upon actuation of said first 

advancing means. 
Apparatus according to any of the preceding 
claims wherein said staple storing means is located at the 

distal end portion of said endoscopic portion and said 
staple storing means is pivotally attached at the distal 

end portion of said endoscopic portion, and further
