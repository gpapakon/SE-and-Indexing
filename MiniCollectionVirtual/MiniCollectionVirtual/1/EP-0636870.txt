<ABSTRACT>
The periphery of a disk (50) having flexibility is fixed to 
a sensor casing, and a force applied to the central portion is 

detected. A doughnut disk-shaped piezoelectric element (20) is 
positioned on the upper surface of the disk (50), and upper 

electrode layers indicated by patterns of D1 to D6 are formed on the 
upper surface of the piezoelectric element (20). Further, lower 

electrode layers similarly having pattern of D1 to D6 are formed on 
the lower surface of the piezoelectric element (20), and the lower 

surface of the lower electrode layer is fixed on the upper surface 
of the disk (50). Six detection elements D1 to D6 are formed each of 

which is constituted by a pair of upper and lower electrode layers 
and a portion of piezoelectric element (20) put therebetween. Thus, 

force components exerted at an origin defined in the central portion 
of the disk (50) in respective axes directions of X, Y, Z can be 

detected based on charges produced in detection elements D1, D2, 
detection elements D3, D4, and detection elements D5, D6, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a force sensor for sensing force/acceleration/magnetism
according to the pre-characterizing
part of claim 1.A sensor of this type is known from e.g.
EP-A-549 807 or EP-A-537 347.In the automobile industry or machinery industry,
etc., there has been an increased demand for sensors
capable of precisely detecting physical action such as
force, acceleration or magnetism. Particularly, compact
sensors capable of detecting these physical actions every
two-dimensional or three-dimensional respective components
are being required.This sensor of EP-A-549 807 is of a structure such that plural
detection elements each comprised of a piezoelectric element
are prepared and such detection elements are disposed on a
flexible substrate, whereby when an external force is
applied to a working body attached on the flexible substrate,
bending takes place in the flexible substrate. This bending
is transmitted to the piezoelectric element. In the 
piezoelectric element, charges corresponding to the bending
are produced. It is thus the fundamental principle of this
sensor that there is employed a method of detecting an
applied external force on the basis of the charges produced.
Since the manner of how bending takes place varies in
dependency upon the direction of an applied external force,
the state where charges are produced with respect to a
plurality of piezoelectric elements arranged at respective
predetermined positions is detected, thereby making it
possible to detect the magnitude and the direction of the
applied external force.In the above-described sensor using piezoelectric
element, four detection elements are required for the
purpose of detecting a force applied in one axial direction.
Accordingly, at least eight detection elements are required
for the two-dimensional force sensor, and at least twelve
detection elements are required for the three-dimensional
force sensor. Accordingly, there is the problem that the
structure becomes complicated since a large number of
detection elements should be arranged on a single flexible
substrate. In addition, each detection element has two
electrodes of an upper electrode and an lower electrode.
Therefore, if independent wirings are respectively implemented
to these respective electrodes, the wiring pattern also
becomes very complicated. With the above in view, an object of this invention
is to provide a sensor using piezoelectric elements which
can be of a simpler structure.This is achieved by the features of claim 1. Preferred
embodiments are set
