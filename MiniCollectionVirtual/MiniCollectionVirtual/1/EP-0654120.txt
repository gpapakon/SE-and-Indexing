<CLAIMS>
A structure that is assembled by using adhesive, 
comprising at least two members, one of which being a 

section bar, characterized in that said section bar has at 
least two parallel longitudinal grooves (108, 109) formed 

in parallel zones (104, 105) of its outside surface, one of 
the surface portions (112a) that extends between the two 

grooves (108, 109) having no region that is inclined in 
undercut manner relative to the plane (P) containing the 

two grooves, while the other member includes a piece (114, 
19) having one end shaped as a fork whose inside surface 

(113) is of a profile similar to the profile of the bar 
over which it is to be fitted, each branch (114a, 114b, 20, 

21) of the fork having a groove (116, 117, 22, 23) formed 
therein similar to the grooves provided in the bar (2, 

100), and two keys (26) received in the facing grooves in 
the fork and in the bar. 
A structure according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the fork (114, 19) is fixed to the bar by means of keys, 

its inside surface (24, 113) is offset from the outside 
surface (25, 112a) of the bar (2, 100) by clearance of 

predetermined constant value. 
The structure according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, in section view, said bar (100, 2) includes at 

least one head (10, 11) similar to the head of a track rail 
head, with the grooves (15) being formed in the sides (13, 

14) thereof. 
A ladder (1) having a cage (7), as an application of the 
structure according to one of the preceding claims, in 

which the bars constitute the uprights of the ladder and 
the other members are constituted by the loops of the cage, 

characterized in that each loop (6) is constituted by a  
 

curved strip including a fork at each of its ends for 
connecting the loop to the uprights (2). 
A ladder according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
cage (7) includes vertical elements (8) constituted by thin 

strips and connected to the loops (6) by assembly devices 
each comprising firstly two plates (31, 32) each provided 

on one of its faces with elements (34, 36) for centering 
the strips that it overlies, and with mutual angular 

indexing elements (33, 35), and secondly means for compressing 
the plates against each other. 
A ladder according to claim 5, characterized in that 
each vertical strip (8) is curved so as to be 

gutter-shaped. 
A ladder according to claim 6, characterized in that 
each vertical strip (8) is made of composite material, and 

the density of longitudinal fibers therein is greater 
adjacent to its convex face than adjacent to its concave 

face. 
A ladder according to any one of claims 4 to 7, characterized 
in that it includes rear fixing brackets (4) each 

being in the form of a right angle, with a fixing fork (28) 
being disposed at the end of one of the webs thereof, the 

fork having a groove (22, 23) on the inside face of each of 
its two branches, said grooves being identical to the 

grooves (15) provided on the lateral faces of the uprights 
(2), and the profile of said inside face being similar to 

that of the profile of the outside face of the head of the 
bar of an upright such that, when the fork (28) is fixed to 

the upright by keys, the inside surface (24) of the fork is 
offset from the outside surface (25) of the upright by 

clearance of constant value.  
 
A ladder according to any one of claims 4 to 8, characterized 
in that the grooves (22, 23) of the forks (19, 28) 

of the fixing brackets (4) and of the loops (6) of the 
cage, and also the grooves (15) of the uprights are all 

semicylindrical, with the keys (26) being constituted by 
pegs that are engaged as a small force-fit within pairs of 

facing half-grooves.
