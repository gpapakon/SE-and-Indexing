<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printing ink comprises an image forming agent in a hot melt composition which is a solid at ambient temperature and a liquid at or below the temperature of jet formation, typically between 80  C and 130  C. The hot melt composition is a thermally reversible eutectic composition formed from compounds having melting points of at least 100  C. The compounds may be selected from the group comprising aromatic amides and aromatic sulfonamides and may have additives such as corrosion inhibitors, biocides, dispersing agents and surfactants. A method of ink jet printing comprises using this printing ink, elevating the temperature of the eutectic hot melt composition to cause the ink to form a liquid solution or suspension of the image forming composition, jetting the ink onto a substrate in the form of images and then allowing the ink to crystallize by cooling on the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to printing ink compositions, particularly solid inks,
which are used in thermal ink-jet printers and are typically termed hot melt inks and
also to a method of ink jet printing using such compositions.Liquid inks have been used in many types of ink-jet printers of which the major
categories are "Drop-On-Demand" ink-jet printers and "Continuous" ink-jet printers. In
a Drop-On-Demand ink-jet printer, ink is normally stored in a reservoir and delivered
by capillary action to a nozzle in the print head of the printer. A means exists to force
a single drop of ink out of the nozzle whenever it is needed to print a single spot on
the printed medium, for example paper. In a Continuous ink-jet printer, ink is forced
out of the nozzle in the form of a jet of ink which is unstable and subsequently breaks
up into a steady stream of droplets. The trajectory of each drop is controlled, typically
by either electrostatic or magnetic forces, either to a catcher for recycling through the
main ink system, or to the printed medium to form a printed spot.Most ink jet inks are liquids at room temperature. However, liquid inks suffer
from various difficulties, especially since they do not respond the same to different
printing media. Typically, liquid ink on office papers will produce a feathered
appearance because it penetrates and spreads into the paper following fiber lines.
Liquid inks that are designed for minimum feathering still require time to set, which
may limit the rate that printed pages are stacked. The print quality usually depends on the type of paper used, which also has an
effect on the drying time and on waterfastness. Although water-based inks have been
widely used, they exhibit poor waterfastness. Also, in order to prevent the ink from
drying in the jet, high concentrations of humectant such as diethylene glycol have
been used. This also leads to a long drying (set) time for the print on the medium and
poor print quality.Liquid inks without curable additives typically are not useful on nonporous
surfaces, such as metal, glass or plastic, because they are too prone to smearing.Furthermore liquid inks are very sensitive to temperature changes which
influence the ink viscosity and interfacial tension and consequently influence the ink
interaction with the medium.It is clear from the foregoing that major problems with liquid ink-jet inks are (i)
media dependent print quality, (ii) poor reliability, (iii) poor waterfastness, and (iv) a
long drying or setting time for the printed
