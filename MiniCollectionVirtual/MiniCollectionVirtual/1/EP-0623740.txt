Device for damping movements, having a compressible damping 
cushion (2) formed from pressed metal wire, characterized 

in that at least one recess (10,11) at least on two facing 
walls (10a,10b; 11a,11b) is bounded by pressed metal wire 

and in each recess (10,11) an incompressible reinforcing part 
(3,4,5,6,7,15) 
not projecting over the outer contour of the 
damping cushion (1) completely takes up the height of the 

recess (10,11) between the facing walls (10a,10b; 11a,11b). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the reinforcing 
part (3,4,5,6,7) is completely surrounded by cushion 

material (2). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the reinforcing 
part (15) is inserted in a groove (11), which is open 

on one side, of the cushion material (2). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that in the case of a circular contour of the cushion (1), 

the reinforcing part (3,4,5,6,7,15) is also circular. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the reinforcing parts (3,4,5,6,7,15) are constructed 

as ring segments. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the reinforcing part is formed by individual wires 

(3). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the reinforcing part is constructed as a wire cable 

or bundle (5). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the reinforcing part is constructed as a solid part 

(4,6).  
 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the reinforcing part is constructed as a sheet packet. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the reinforcing part is in the form of a hollow profile 

(7). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 10, characterized 
in that the reinforcing part (15) has a contour diverging 

from the contour of the damping cushion (2). 
Device according to claim 11, characterized in that in the 
case of a circular ring-shaped cushion contour the reinforcing 

part (15) is elliptical. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the cross-section of the reinforcing part (15) is 

circumferentially different. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the damping cushion (1) is formed from several individual 

cushions. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that on the damping cushion (2) as abutments wall portions 

(28,29; 38,39) of a casing (24,36) enclosing the damping cushion 
which exclusively engage from the outside and are immediately 

juxtaposed are movable relative to one another. 
Device according to claim 15, characterized in that wall portions 
(28,29; 38,39) of a casing part (24,36) arranged on either 

side of the damping cushion (2) in each case face one another 
in pairwise aligned manner.  

 
Device according to claim 16, characterized in that wall portions 
(28 with 38; 29 with 39) of different casing parts (24,36) 

movable relative to one another and arranged on either side 
of the damping cushion (2) face one another in aligned manner.
