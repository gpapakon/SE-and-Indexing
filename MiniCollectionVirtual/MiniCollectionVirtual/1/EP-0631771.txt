<DESCRIPTION>
Our invention relates to stable transparent oil-in-water
microemulsion concentrates consisting essentially of:
(i) water;(ii) one or more hydrophobic flavor or fragrance oils; and(iii) one or more surfactants
as well as a process for preparing such transparent
microemulsion compositions, mouthwash compositions containing
such transparent microemulsion compositions, and perfume
compositions containing such transparent microemulsion
compositions.The concept of the microemulsion was introduced by Schulman
and Montague, Ann. New York Academy of Science, 1961, Volume
92, page 366. Becher, American Chemical Society Symposium
Series 448, ACS, Washington, D.C., 1991 contains two chapters
covering microemulsions in foods: Chapter 1, El- Nokaly, et al
and Chapter 2, Friberg, et al. The microemulsion system
typically contains relatively large amounts of oil and water
along with a surfactant and cosurfactant except in the case of
certain hydrophobic surfactants where no cosurfactant may be
required. These systems are indicated in the prior art to form
spontaneously as a result of contact between the several
components.The most characteristic difference betweem an emulsion and
a microemulsion is the appearance of the microemulsion and the
emulsion. An emulsion is turbid while the microemulsion is
transparent.Rosano, U.S. Letters Patent 4,146,499 issued on March 27,
1979 discloses a method for the preparation of oil-in-water
microemulsions via a four-step process: (1) a surfactant is
selected which is just barely soluble in the oil phase; (2) 
the surfactant thus selected is dissolved in the oil to be
emulsified in an amount effective to yield a fine emulsion
of the emulsified oil in an aqueous phase; (3) the oil,
together with its dissolved surfactant is added to the water
phase and shaken or stirred; and (4) finally there is provided
a second surfactant in the water phase which is somewhat more
soluble in water than the first surfactant to produce a
substantially clear microemulsion of oil in water. Wolf, et
al, U.S. Letters Patent 4,835,002 issued on May 30, 1989
discloses microemulsions of edible oils in a matrix of water
and certain alcohols which are prepared using certain edible
surfactants for use in various products such as beverages.
El-Nokaly, et al, U.S. Letters Patent 5,045,337 issued on
September 3, 1991 discloses microemulsions which are
thermodynamically stable, clear and homogeneous which are made
from a polar solvent, a specific polyglycerol mono, diester and
a lipid. El-Nokaly, et al discloses that
