<ABSTRACT>
In order to develop a method and an apparatus for manufacturing a blister-pack or skin-pack unit, in such a way that it can be manufactured more efficiently in terms of presentation function and anti-theft protection, at the same time with an improved separability of the materials used for the disposal of these, it is proposed that there be placed under the carrier material (3) a bottom foil (2), on which rests the printed carrier material (3) which is provided with punched-out perforations (6) limiting the product zones (4), that the individual products (4) be laid onto these product zones and covered with top foil (5) which is drawn onto the product (4) and the carrier material (3) by the vacuum-drawing process, with, in the region of the perforations (6), the overlap regions of the first and of the resting-on top foil (2, 5) being pressed together to make a releasable connection (7), and that, finally, the product zones provided with products (4) and covered on both sides with bottom and top foil (2, 5) respectively be separated individually, for which purpose the feed table (15) has at least one chain strand, equipped with drivers (17), or advancing linkage (18), there being formed on the drivers (17) noses (19) which form a narrowing gap (20) relative to the feed-table plane (21), and the bottom foil (2) and carrier material (3) being insertable into the narrowing gap (20) for advance on the feed-table plane (21).

A method of manufacturing blister-pack units 
consisting of an upper and a lower sheet as well as 

a base material, whereby in a first step of the 
method, the goods to be packaged are placed on the 

base material, for example cardboard or paperboard, 
laid on the lower sheet, and, in a second step of 

the method, a top sheet is applied around the items 
either by a heat-shrinking process or by vacuum 

using a deep-drawing process, whereby perforations 
are provided at the peripheral region of the base 

material for the individual goods in the form of 
cut-out portions defining individual packages and 

whereby in a third step of the method the pack units 
are separated into individual packs, characterised 

in that in order to make a detachable join (7) in 
the area where the top sheet (5) and the bottom 

sheet (2) overlap, the perforations (6) extend in a 
punched-out strip (8) around the individual bases 

(3) on which the goods (4) are placed, whereby the 
strips are interrupted on the transverse and 

longitudinal edges by tongues or tabs (9) on the 
base material (3) and in which, in order to produce 

the detachable join (7), the top and the bottom 
sheets (5, 2) are pressed together by a vacuum 

drawing process in the region of the perforations 
(6) and whereby the tongues or tabs (9) arranged on 

the transverse and longitudinal edges form the 
joints between the individual bases in the base 

material (3) of paperboard or cardboard to a 
cardboard surface (10), before the base material (3) 

is separated in the final step of the method. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in  
 

that in the region of the perforations (6), the 
overlapping peripheral regions of the sheets (2, 5) 

lying one on top of the other are drawn together 
during the vacuum-drawing process to form a notched 

joint (11), and the notched joint (11) is 
interrupted in the region of the tongues or tabs (9) 

arranged on the transverse and longitudinal edges. 
A method as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that labels or commercial 

stickers can be applied to the base material (3) 
even before the process of deep-drawing. 
A method as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that during the third step of the method, in 

order to separate the packing units (1) from the 
join and from the cardboard surface, at least one 

side-length (12) of the overlapping region is 
removed. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that when separating the individual pack units (1) 

from the join and out of the cardboard surface (10) 
to form a pocket, the upper overlapping edge (12) of 

the connecting notched joint (11) extending 
transversely is cut away. 
A method as claimed in one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cardboard or 

paperboard faces (10) forming the individual packs 
joined to another by the tongues or tabs (9) are 

surrounded by a frame (14) of cardboard or 
paperboard.
