<CLAIMS>
Telescopic steering shaft, for a motor vehicle, for 
example, of the type comprising two tubular, cylindrical 

shaft portions (2, 3) which are movable by sliding one 
inside the other, one (2) comprising outer axial grooves 

(4) adapted to co-operate with complementary inner 
grooves (5) on the other shaft portion (3) and resilient 

means for taking up the radial assembly play between 
these two shaft portions, comprising at least one tongue 

(6; 7; 8; 9) cut out from at least one of the shaft 
portions and bent radially towards the other shaft 

portion so as to bias the shaft portions towards each 
other, characterised in that said at least one tongue is 

cut out within the length of said at least one shaft 
portion, in an intermediate part located between the 

ends of said portion. 
Steering shaft according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the play takeup means comprise a plurality of 

tongues arranged on the or each shaft portion.
