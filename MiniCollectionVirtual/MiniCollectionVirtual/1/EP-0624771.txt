<ABSTRACT>
The turbulence component (20) is held clamped into position by its own spring force and is formed as a wire with wave formations in its longitudinal direction (21) with alternating wave peaks (22) and wave valleys (23), of which at least some are in contact with the inside (18) of the body of the flat tube (10). The wire (2) has central sections (24) and the wave peaks (22) connecting on one side to the central sections and the wave valleys (23) connecting on the other side to the central position (24) are bent through an acute angle in relation to the central sections to the one and/or the other side. The central sections (24) extend in a common plane.

A flat tube for heat exchangers, into which at least one turbulence 
element (20) is inserted, being held therein by its own clamping spring force, 

the turbulence element (20) being formed from a wire (21) undulating at least 
in its longitudinal direction, with alternating peaks (22) and valleys (23), at 

least some of which are in contact with the inside d(18) of the tubular 
member ofthe flat tube (10), the wire (21) having middle portions (24), and 

characterised in that all middle portions (24) extend in a common plane (25), 

and in that all peaks (22) which are on one side and adjacent the middle 
portions (24) are bent over at an obtuse angle (β
1
) to one side of the plane 
(25) of the middle portions (24) and in that all valleys (23) adjacent the 

middle portions (24) on the other side are bent over at an obtuse angle (β
2
) 
to the other side of the plane (25) of the middle portions (24). 
A flat tube according to Claim 1, characterised in that the angle (β
1
) 
at which the valleys (22) are bent over is at least substantially equal to the 

angle (β
2
) at which the valleys (23) are bent over.  
 
A flat tube according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the bent 
over peaks (22) extent in the longitudinal direction of the turbulence element 

(20) in a plane (26) common to them all and/or in that the bent over valleys 
(23) extend in the longitudinal direction of the turbulence element (20) in a 

plane (27) common to them all. 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
plane (26) within which the bent over peaks (22) extend extends substantially 

parallel with the plane (27) within which the bent over valleys (23) extend. 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
plane (25) within which the middle portions (24) extend extends between the 

other two planes (26 and 27), in each case at an angle of about 120° to each 
of them. 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
wire (21) - viewed in the cross-section of the flat tube (10) - while following 

a substantially Z-shaped path, is held clamped in the tubular member, the 
middle portion (24) comprising a middle strut, a peak (22) which forms one 

cross bar ofthe Z while a valley (23) forms the other cross bar, starting from 
the respective end of the middle strut (24). 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
respective cranked over peak (22) in the tubular member extends in an 

oblique pattern from the inside (18) of a broad face (14) substantially as far 
as the inside (18) of the oppositely disposed broad face (15). 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the 
respective cranked over valley (23) in the tubular member extends in an 

oblique pattern from the inside (19) of a broad face (14) substantially as far 
as the inside (18) of the oppositely disposed broad face (15).  

 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the 
greater longitudinal axis (11) of the tubular member, viewed in cross-section, 

is crossed by the middle portion (24) extending obliquely to it and the peak 
(22) and valley (23) extending obliquely in the opposite direction to it. 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that, 
viewed in cross-section, the end portions (16, 17) at the end of the greater 

longitudinal axis (11) of the tubular member are in their interior at least 
substantially out of contact with the turbulence element (20), particularly a 

peak (22) or a valley (23), these end portions (16, 17) forming on the inside 
continuously free flow passages extending in the direction of the longitudinal 

central axis (13) ofthe tubular member. 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that 
the wire (21) has the preferably rounded tips of the peaks (22) and/or of the 

valleys (23) and/or - per arm of the middle portions (24) in between - the 
bent-over locations in substantially punctiform contact with the inside (18) of 

the tubular member, in particular with the broad faces (14, 15) thereof. 
A flat tube according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that
