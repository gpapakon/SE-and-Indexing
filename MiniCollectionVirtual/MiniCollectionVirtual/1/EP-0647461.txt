A filtering separator, the housing of which being divided into a crude gas area (3) 

and a clean gas area (4) by means of a housing dividing wall (2) provided with parallel 
rows of openings (2a), whereby connecting openings (5a) of filter elements (5) placed in 

the crude gas area are allocated to said openings, the filter material of said filter 
elements being impinged on from the outside towards the inside by particle containing 

crude gas and being supported by spacing elements (5b) located on the inside, and in 
which a chamber (8) can travel back and forth periodically and stepwise in the clean gas 

area at the housing dividing wall for reverse flow cleaning of the filter elements whilst 
shrouding adjacent filter element connecting openings, said chamber with a compressed 

air supply to at least one injector via a control valve (13) for providing a brief, pulsed 
supply of compressed air mixed with secondary flush gas drawn from said injector to the 

respective filter elements to be cleaned, the chamber being divided into a suction area 
(8a) at the injector side and a pressure area (8b) by means of a chamber dividing wall 

(9), the wall of the pressure area which faces the housing dividing wall comprising 
openings (8d) which overlap the connecting openings of the filter elements to be cleaned 

in each case, characterised in that the wall which separates the suction area (8a) of the 
chamber (8) from the clean gas area (4) is provided with at least one opening (17) on 

which there is located a shut-off element (18) which, in the manner of a check valve, 
permits the drawing of clean gas from the clean gas area (4) into the suction area as a 

secondary flush gas, but prevents a flow of gas in the reverse direction. 
A filtering separator according to claim 1, characterised in that the wall of the 
chamber (8) which faces the housing dividing wall comprises a flexibly bendable material. 
A filtering separator according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that 
inflatable hollow bodies (19) connected to the compressed air supply are arranged in the 

pressure area (8b) of the chamber (8) in the region of the peripheral zone of the wall 
facing the housing dividing wall (2).  

 
A filtering separator according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that an injector (20) with a supply of compressed air via a control valve is arranged 

outside of the chamber (8) in front of each shut-off element (18), and that the gas outlet 
opening of the injector (20) faces the shut-off element.
