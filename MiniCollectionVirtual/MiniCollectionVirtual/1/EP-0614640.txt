<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat insulating
cooking vessel which may be suitably utilized for a cooking
process by which food semi-cooked by heating is kept warm
and brought to a completely cooked state.In general, the process of heating and cooking food
involves electric heat or a direct flame. However, such a
cooking process makes food susceptible to breakdown or
scorching due to heating, and consumes a large amount of
energy.A cooking process wherein raw vegetables or grains are
immersed in an appropriate quantity of boiling water or a
boiling seasoned soup, or semi-cooked food is kept warm for
an extended period of time to bring it to a completely
cooked state, have been advanced in recent years as
processes which resolve the above-mentioned problems.Conventional heat insulating cooking vessels such as
that shown, for example, in Japanese Utility Model 3-10920
(Utility Model Appln., Publication No. Heisei 3-10920),
wherein a freely hinged handle is attached at the edge of
the mouth of the cooking pot, and an engaging portion is
provided to this handle, so that when the handle is
operated, the aforesaid engaging portion contacts with a
portion of the pot, thereby preventing the food contained
therein from easily spilling, are available as heat
insulating cooking vessels wherein cooking is performed by
placing a cooking pot, containing a food material which has
been preheated until semi-cooked, in the heat insulating
vessel, closing the vessel to seal it, and maintaining the
cooking pot and contents therein in a heat insulating state
for a desired period of time.However, the aforementioned conventional heat
insulating cooking vessel has the following problems.
Namely, because there is no handle on the heat insulating
cooking vessel itself, when carrying it, it is cumbersome
to transport. Further, because the secure fit of the lid 
to the cooking pot cannot be assured, when being carried
the cooking pot within the heat insulating vessel shifts
easily and the food contained therein spills easily.
Moreover, food which has spilled over from the cooking pot
into the heat insulating container could spill out from the
heat insulating container, presenting a hazard.A heat insulating cooking apparatus as shown in Figure
13 is available as a conventional cooking apparatus
applicable to this type of cooking. This heat
insulating cooking vessel consists of a lid 4 releasably
provide to the container 3. The container 3 is closed and
sealed with the lid 4 and, moreover, an inner pot 2 is
releasably contained
