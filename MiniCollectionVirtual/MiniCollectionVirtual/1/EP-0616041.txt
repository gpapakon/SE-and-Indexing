<ABSTRACT>
A ferrophosphorus refining method entailing forming 
a ferrophosphorus melt and adding an oxidising agent to 

the melt to oxidise the impurities in the melt. The 
oxidised impurities then rise to the top of the melt and 

either go into the slag or escape in a gaseous form. The 
slag is removed and a refined ferrophosphorus is 

recovered. Suitable oxidising agent include solids such 
as ferrous oxide (Fe₂O₃), ferric oxide (Fe₃O₄), ferrous-ferric 

oxide (FeO), mill scale, limestone, dolomitic 
limestone, lime and any alkalide carbonate, and gaseous 

oxidising agents such as oxygen, air and mixtures 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for refining a 
metallurgical grade phosphorus-rich ferrous alloy to 
remove impurities. The phosphorus-rich ferrous alloy 
refined by the process of the present invention is 
especially suited for use in particulate processing 
technologies. Phosphorus additions are used to improve the 
mechanical properties of certain grades of steel. In 
particulate processing technology, phosphorus additions 
are used to improve the mechanical properties for certain 
structural components and to enhance the magnetic 
properties for certain soft-magnetic components. 
Phosphorus can be added either as a particulate elemental 
phosphorus or as a phosphorous alloy. Use of particulate 
elemental phosphorus presents both processing 
difficulties and safety hazards. Thus, the use of a 
phosphorus alloy is the preferred mode for adding 
phosphorus. A metallurgical grade phosphorus-iron alloy (or 
ferrophosphorus) is available as a by-product from the 
production of elementary phosphorus and typically 
contains about 15 to 30 weight percent phosphorus and a 
remainder of iron with a high level of impurities. As an 
example, metallurgical grade ferrophosphorus may contain 
around 3 weight percent silicon and around 2 weight 
percent manganese. It has been found that such a high 
level of impurities is detrimental to both the mechanical 
and magnetic properties of the particulate metal product 
to which it is added. Use of ferrophosphorus with low impurity levels, for 
example silicon below about 0.5 weight percent, manganese 
below about 0.75 weight percent, and carbon below about 
0.5 weight percent, results in favourable combination of 
mechanical and magnetic properties for components made by  
 
particulate processing technology. Conventionally, the impurity level of metallurgical 
grade ferrophosphorus is controlled by controlling the 
charge to the furnace and the recovery of the 
ferrophosphorus from the furnace during production of 
elemental phosphorus. One way to produce ferrophosphorus 
with low impurities is to melt high purity iron and 
phosphorus in a reaction vessel. However, this would 
require special handling of the phosphorus and would not 
be cost effective. US Patent No. 4,201,576 discloses a method for 
removing silicon from ferrophosphorus. In this 
reference, the silicon in an unrefined ferrophosphorus is 
changed to silica (silicon dioxide) by treating the 
unrefined ferrophosphorus with an aqueous oxidising agent 
and then drying the silica-containing

A method for refining ferrophosphorus comprising the 
steps of: forming a melt of the ferrophosphorus and 

allowing a layer of slag to form on the top surface of 
the melt; removing the slag from the top of the melt; 

and recovering a refined ferrophosphorus, characterised 
by treating a ferrophosphorus melt with an oxidising 

agent at a temperature above the melting point of the 
ferrophosphorus to oxidise impurities contained within 

the melt so that oxidised impurities in the melt migrate 
to the slag. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the starting ferrophosphorus is a metallurgical 

grade ferrophosphorus having a phosphorus content of 15 
to 30 weight percent, an iron content of 80 to 65 weight 

percent and the remainder being impurities. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterised in that the impurities being oxidised are 

one or more of silicon, manganese, chromium, carbon,
