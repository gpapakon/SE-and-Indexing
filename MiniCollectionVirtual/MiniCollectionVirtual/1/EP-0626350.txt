<ABSTRACT>
A molten glas gob distributor (10) for a glass 
container manufacturing system that includes a plurality of gob 

discharges (18,20,22) and a plurality of scoops (12,14,16) for 
receiving gobs from each such discharge and distributing the 

gobs among a plurality of troughs (30,32,34) leading to 
associated molds (35a,35b,35c) in an IS machine. Each scoop is 

mounted to rotate about a fixed axis with the upper end 
remaining positioned beneath the associated gob discharge while 

the lower end swings through an arc adjacent to the associated 
troughs. A plurality of electric servo motors (48,50,52) are 

individually coupled to each associated scoop for selectively 
and individually rotating the scoops. The electric motors are 

connected to servo motor controllers (60,62,64) for 
synchronizing operation of the motors and rotation of the scoops 

to each other and to operation of the forming machine (35). The 
motor controllers synchronize operation of each motor by means 

of a synchronizing input from the forming machine (Fig. 1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a molten
glass gob distributor for a glass article manufacturing
system as contained in the preamble of claim 1 and to a
method of distributing molten glass gobs from a plurality of
gob discharge means among a corresponding plurality of glass
article forming molds.Glass containers are conventionally formed in a
machine that comprises a plurality of sections, in each of
which there are one or more blank or parison mold cavities
and transfer mechanisms that are synchronized with each
other. This machine, called an individual section or IS
machine, receives glass in the form of discrete mold charges
or gobs. Molten glass from a furnace is cut into individual
gobs, which are fed to a gob distributor. The purpose of the
gob distributor is to distribute the gobs to the individual
sections of the IS machine in the appropriate sequence in
such a way that the glass gobs simultaneously arrive at the
mold cavities in each section in sequence. US-A 3,585,017
and US-A-3,597,187 illustrate the general technology.US-A-2,859,559 discloses a gob distributor
construction in which a scoop is disposed beneath a gob shear
mechanism for receiving molten gobs in sequence, and is
coupled by a shaft to a motor for feeding the individual gobs
to spaced chutes or troughs. Each trough leads to the initial
mold cavity of an associated section of an IS machine. Each
cavity of the IS machine has an associated trough, and the
scoop feeds gobs to the individual troughs in an appropriate
sequence. US-A-3,597,187 discloses a gob distributor in which
a plurality of scoops each have an upper end disposed beneath
an associated gob discharge, and a lower end disposed to swing 
through an arc adjacent to a corresponding plurality of
troughs. Each scoop is carried by a scoop support frame, which
is in turn coupled to a drive shaft. The multiple drive
shafts are coupled to a gear transmission drive, in which the
shafts are conjointly driven through associated gears by a
single motor. Although this transmission drive arrangement
maintains proper synchronism among the scoops, a problem
arises when it is desired to change the number of scoops. An
entirely new transmission drive is required.US-A-4,357,157, on which the preamble to claim 1 is
based, discloses a gob distributer in which each a step motor
is coupled with a rotary shaft to an associated distributing
scoop to position the lower end of the scoop in alignment with
an article forming station. The accuracy of the device depends
from the step size of the

A molten glass gob distributor (10) for a glass
article manufacturing system that includes a plurality of

gob discharge means (18,20,22), and means for receiving gobs
from each of said discharge means and distributing said gobs

among a plurality of article forming means (35a,35b,35c),
said receiving and distributing means comprising:


a plurality of scoops (12,14,16) each having an
upper end disposed beneath an associated discharge means and

a lower end,
means (24,26,28) mounting each said scoop to
rotate about a fixed axis such that said upper end remains

positioned beneath the associated said discharge means and
the lower end swings through an arc,
a plurality of electric motors (48,50,52)
individually coupled to said mounting means for selectively

and individually rotating said scoops, and
motor control means including sensor means (R1,
R2) coupled to said plurality of motors for synchronizing the

operation of said motors and the rotation of said scoops to each
other and to the operation of said forming means,

characterizing in that said motors (48,50,52)
comprise respective three phase a.c. servo motors,
a gear box (42,44,46) is operatively coupling each
said motor (48,50,52 ) to the associated scoop (12,14,16 ),

and
said sensor means includes a first sensor (R1)
being coupled to the associated said motor such that the

resolution of said first sensor (R1) is multiplied by the
gear ratio of said gear box (42,44,46).

generating a varying signal indicative of the desired position
of each respective scoop, each said first sensor (R1) coupled to

each of said motors for providing a signal indicative of the
actual position thereof, means

signal for each of said motors as a function of a difference

between the associated desired and actual position signals,

second torque commands to two phases of the associated said
motor, and means (54,56,58) for applying a third torque

command to the third phase of the associated said motor as a

commands.

wherein said sensor means of said motor control means

further comprises a second sensor (R2) operatively coupled
