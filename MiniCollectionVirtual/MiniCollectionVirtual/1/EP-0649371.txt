<ABSTRACT>
A tire recapping and retreading method and apparatus that includes a rigid, segmented tread mold (14). The mold segments (26), (28), (30), (32) are retained in place over the tire carcass and uncured tread material by a resilient elastic tension band located in an annular groove (16) or by prestressed metal tension springs. Further retaining force is provided by a resilient envelope to complete the formation of the retread when the tire and apparatus is placed in a hot air oven.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a method and
apparatus for retreading a prepared tire carcass. More
particularly, but not by way of limitation, this invention
relates to an improved method and apparatus for retreading
a prepared tire carcass utilizing a tread mold that
includes a plurality of rigid mold segments arranged to be
located around the retreading material. In the past, heavy duty mechanical and/or hydraulic
closing devices were utilized with the retread molds during
the formation of a new tread in retreading material on
radial tire carcasses. The use of such closing devices
required apparatus that is extremely heavy and expensive.
Further, tire distortion frequently occurs when the molds
are closed on the tire. This was particularly true if the
tires were slightly large in diameter. In such cases, the
tire would often buckle and thus could no longer be used.Another method of recapping or retreading tires is
illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,767,480 issued August 30,
1988 to Leon C. Goldstein. In that patent, there is
described apparatus and method for recapping or retreading
that uses a cold process. In that process, a flexible
tread mold is utilized that is stretched over the tire
carcass. Subsequently, an envelope is placed over the mold
and tire assembly and the entire unit is placed in a
chamber where curing of the rubber is accomplished by
inflation of the tire carcass, evacuation of the envelope
and pressurization of the chamber and the application of
heat.U.S. Patent No. 5,053,094 issued October 1, 1991 to
Richard H. Detwiler illustrates a method of retreading a
tire wherein an uncured rubber layer is placed between the
tire carcass and the undersurface of a precured tread layer
held in place by prestressed bands that are constructed
from a synthetic polymer. The bands are tensioned to exert
a force on the precured tread layer so that the tread layer
is adhered to the carcass by the uncured rubber as it cures
in a curing chamber.U.S. Patent No. 4,588,460 issued May 13, 1986 to
Arthur W. McGee, et al. illustrates a method and apparatus
for retreading a tire that includes a relatively flexible
mold that may be formed of a plurality of segments. The 
ends of adjacent mold segments may include guides so that
the mold, when closed, will form a circle about the tire to
be retreaded. In this process, an elastic band may
encircle the segmented mold for the purpose of holding the
mold in position on the tire during handling such as when
the envelope is placed over the tire which ultimately

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for retreading a prepared tire
carcass (10) having uncured retreading material (12)

located around the exterior of said tire carcass (10)
comprising:


a tread mold (14) including a plurality of rigid
mold segments (26, 28, 30, 32) arranged to expand and

contract relative to each other and for allowing said
segmented tire mold (14) to expand and contract radially

around said retreading material (12);
resilient retaining means including
an elastomeric tension band (18) and

at least one
annular tension spring (20) encircling said segmented

tire mold (14) for urging said mold segments toward said
tire carcass (10) and for retaining said segmented tire

mold (14) as a whole while allowing said segments (26,
28, 30, 32) to expand and contract radially relative to

each other;
each mold segment (26, 28, 30, 32) having at least
one annular groove (22) in an outer surface and said

annular spring (20) is located in said groove (22); and
a pressure envelope (219) for placement over said
mold segments (26, 28, 30, 32) and said tire carcass

(10).
The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a
wedge (40) located between the ends of adjacent mold

segments (26, 28, 30, 32) for preventing extrusion of
uncured retreading material (12) between the ends of said

adjacent mold segments (26, 28, 30, 32). 
The apparatus of claim 1 and also including
alignment means (34) on the exterior of adjacent mold

segments (26, 28, 30, 32) operably engagable to locate
said mold segments (26, 28, 30, 32) in a circular

disposition encircling said carcass (10).
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said segmented
tire mold (14) further comprises ten rigid mold segments.
