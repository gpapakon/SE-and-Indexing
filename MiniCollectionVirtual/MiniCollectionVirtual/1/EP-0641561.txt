<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical device for
the administration of drugs or active ingredients at low
concentrations, and particularly for the administration
of homeopathic drugs.As is well known, homeopathy is a therapeutic approach
based on the concept that disease conditions should be
cured by administering drugs which, in healthy people,
induce a symptom picture similar to that manifested by
the disease one intends to treat. Also typical of
homeopathic treatment is that extremely low, and
sometimes infinitesimal doses of the homeopathic remedy
must be given in order to induce the desired therapeutic
effect, whereas high doses of the same drug would
actually cause the symptom picture of the disease one is
seeking to cure.Homeopathic preparations are traditionally prepared by
means of a method (called "potentization") consisting in
a succession of dilutions and succussions of the drug
solution; part of the drug (of a vegetable, animal,
mineral or synthetic nature) is dissolved (or ground
according to the substance) in nine parts of distilled 
water or alcohol and the resulting mixture is shaken
vigorously. Nine parts of this initial solution are
taken and diluted with nine parts of water or alcohol
and the resulting second diluted solution is again
subjected to vigorous succussion. This stage of dilution
and succussion can subsequently be repeated several
times. Standard potentization levels include the 3x
(three times), 6x, 200x, 1000x dilutions, etc. A
homeopathic preparation therefore presents itself
generally in the form of an extremely dilute solution
(aqueous, alcoholic or hydro-alcoholic) of active
ingredient.This type of pharmaceutical formulation severely
conditions the mode of administration of homeopathic
preparations, limiting it to the oral administration of
a number of drops of solution, repeated at one-hourly
intervals or, at least, several times a day.Furthermore, to achieve maximum efficacy, the drops of
solution must be placed under the tongue and held there
for a certain amount of time before being swallowed. For
example (see "Applied Homeopathy" by R. Jacobs and M.E.
Pinkerson. Homeopathy Press, Santa Monica, CA, 1983),
10-15 drops of a homeopathic drug for the treatment of
neuralgia and sciatica (consisting of Belladonna 6x,
Spigelia 6x, Mag.phos. 6x, and Cimifuga 6x) are 
administered until symptoms are reduced and thereafter
the same dose is given 4 times daily until symptoms
disappear, holding the solution each time under the
tongue for 30 seconds before swallowing it.

<CLAIMS>
Medical device for the administration of active
ingredients or drugs at very low doses, and

particularly of homeopathic drugs, comprising a
transdermal patch characterized by the following

components:

a) a support membrane 1 defining the outer surface
of the patch distal to the skin area chosen for

the application;
b) a layer of porous adhesive 3 on the opposite
side of the patch defining the contact surface

between the patch and the skin 4;
c) a microporous membrane 2 for controlling the
release of the drug, placed between support

membrane 1 and porous adhesive layer 3; and
d) a gel 6 containing, scattered within it, the
homeopathic drug 5 to be administered.

The microporous membrane 2 defining, above it, a gel
zone 6a acting as a reservoir for the drug, and,

below it, a gel zone 6b in which the drug
concentration is lowe
r than that in zone 6a.
Medical device according to claim 1 in which the gel
6 consists of glycerine, distilled water, lactose,

poly-(vinyl)alcohol, poly(vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) and
sodium citrate.
