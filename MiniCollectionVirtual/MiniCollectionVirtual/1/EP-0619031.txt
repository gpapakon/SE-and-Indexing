<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optic modulators 
in general, and more particularly to integrated optic 
modulators using light interference to achieve light 
intensity modulation in response to electrical input 
signal value changes. There are already known various constructions of 
optic modulators, among them those which utilize 
interference between coherent light beams or portions 
originating at the same light source but selectively 
phase-shifted relative to one another, prior to being 
combined, in such a manner as to impose the desired 
intensity modulation onto the combined light beam. In this context, it is to be mentioned that 
integrated optic intensity modulators that employ 
optical materials exhibiting the electrooptic effect, 
especially lithium niobate or lithium tantalate, offer 
many advantages and, consequently, are becoming 
increasingly important and popular in high-performance 
analog fiber optic links. In a representative integrated optic intensity 
modulator of this kind, input light is split into two 
portions each of which is launched into one of two 
parallel waveguides, which are formed in respective 
regions of a substrate of the above optical material 
exhibiting the electrooptic effect, for guided  
 
propagation in such waveguides. Then, a different 
phase shift is induced in each of such light 
portions during its propagation in the associated 
waveguide by applying a different electric potential 
difference or field, typically of the same magnitude 
but of the opposite sense, across each of the 
waveguides, using respective electrodes extending 
parallel to one another along such waveguides. The 
light portions emerging from the waveguides are then 
combined, with the result that interference effects 
result in modulation of the intensity of the combined 
light in dependence on the phase difference between 
the light portions arriving from the two waveguides. 
By varying the difference between the applied electric 
fields, the intensity of the combined light can be 
selectively varied from its peak achieved when the 
light portions are in phase, due to constructive 
interference, to its low, ideally zero, occurring when 
the light portions are 180Â° out of phase with 
attendant substantially complete destructive 
interference. A particular advantage of integrated optic 
modulators of this kind, aside from incurring only 
minuscule or negligible optical losses, is that they 
can be compact in size, thus minimizing not only the 
amount of space occupied by them but also

to light and acoustic waves and has both electrooptic

a pair of associated elongated light waveguides

substantially coextensively with one another; 
means (13) for launching two portions of light of 
substantially identical properties each into one of said 

waveguides for propagation longitudinally thereof; 
means (21,22,23) for inducing different phase 
shifts in said light portions as they propagate in said 

waveguides, including means for imposing different 
variable electric fields onto each of said waveguides; 

and 
means (14) for combining said light portions with 
one another after the emergence thereof from said 

waveguides with attendant amplitude modulation of the 
combined output light due to interference between such 

phase-shifted light portions; characterised in that said 
waveguides are separated from one another by a 

transverse distance that gradually varies along the

not parallel to one another over a significant portion 
of their lengths.

wherein said substrate is plate shaped having two major 

surfaces; wherein both of said waveguides are situated 
at one (19) of said major surfaces; and wherein said 

imposing means includes respective pairs of electrodes 
(21,22;22,23) disposed at said one major surface across 

an associated one of said waveguides from one another in 
each of said electrode pairs, and means for supplying 

electric energy to said electrodes in such a manner as  
 

to create between said electrodes of each of said 
electrode pairs respective electrical potential 

differences resulting in said different electric fields. 
The optic modulator as defined in claim 2, 
wherein one (22) of said electrodes of each of said 

electrode pairs is situated between said waveguides and 
is merged with said one electrode of the respective 

other of said pairs into a unitary electrode; and 
wherein said supplying means includes means (28) for 

maintaining said unitary electrode at a predetermined

wherein said electrodes of each of said electrode pairs

claim, wherein said launching means includes an input 

optical coupler (13) formed in said substrate upstream 
of said waveguides as considered in the direction of 

propagation of incoming light and operative for

wherein said combining means includes an output optical 
coupler (14) formed in said substrate downstream of said

claim, wherein said spacing is at its minimum at the 

region of respective ends of said waveguides and 
increases from said ends toward a central region of said
