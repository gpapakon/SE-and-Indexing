<ABSTRACT>
A connecting element inspecting method inspects a 
connector (C) having a connecting surface (C1) to 

another connector paired with the connecting element 
and a plurality of terminal containing holes (C2) 

opening to the connecting surface (C1) for 
respectively containing terminals (T). The connecting 

surface (C1) is irradiated by light entering the 
terminal containing holes. The connecting surface is 

imaged obliquely from a television camera (70). The 
percentage of the area of a portion occupied by the 

terminal (T) in an image region (Q) associated with 
the terminal containing hole to be inspected is found. 

It is judged whether or not the terminal is properly 
mounted in the terminal containing hole to be 

inspected on the basis of the found percentage of the 
area. Consequently, it is judged whether the 

connector (C) is accepted or rejected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connecting element 
inspecting method and a connecting element inspecting device 
for detecting a state where terminals are mounted in terminal 
containing holes, inclusion of foreign materials into the 
terminal containing holes, and the like in a connecting 
element such as a connector or a socket and judging whether 
the connecting element is accepted or rejected. In a connecting element, for example, a connector, a 
terminal has been conventionally inserted into a terminal 
containing hole opening to a connecting surface to another 
connector to a predetermined position from the rear thereof. 
In the connector, the terminal is generally held in the 
predetermined position by a lance provided on the side of a 
connector housing or on the side of the terminal. A lot of connectors fabricated include one in which a 
terminal is not inserted to the above described predetermined 
position. Such a connector must be eliminated by inspection. Therefore, examples of a conventionally known inspecting 
device for inspecting a connector include one so adapted as to 
elastically push a front end of a terminal by a pin  
 
elastically urged by a spring and mechanically push out the 
terminal incompletely inserted and then, check the conduction 
of the terminal (see Japanese Utility type Laid-Open Gazette 
No. 47093/1987). There exists a connector in a so-called half-inserted 
state in which a terminal is not completely inserted to a 
predetermined position, although it is engaged with a 
connector housing to such a extent that it receives an 
engaging force at a certain level by a lance. When such a 
connector in a half-inserted state is inspected by the above 
described inspecting device, the terminal can be generally 
pushed out by an urging force produced by a pin. If each 
electric wire is bound by tape winding or the like, however, 
the terminal cannot be pushed out by the urging force produced 
by the pin, so that the connector passes the check of the 
conduction. When this connector is actually connected to 
another connector, the terminal is pushed out by a 
corresponding terminal in the other connector or the terminal 
is moved by causes such as vibration during its use, so that 
the connector is incompletely connected. In the above described inspecting device, therefore, it 
is considered that the urging force of the spring for urging 
the pin is increased. In this case, however, the terminal is 
deformed, plating on the surface of the terminal is stripped 
and
