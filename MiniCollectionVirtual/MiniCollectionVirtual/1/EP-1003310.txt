<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a calibration
apparatus applicable to a TDMA (Time Division Multiple
Access) based and a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
based digital radio communication.In conventional digital radio communications, a
multiple access system is used and there are cases where
an adaptive array antenna is used as the antenna. The
multiple access system refers to a channel access system
when a plurality of stations perform communications
simultaneously using a same band. The TDMA system
included in this multiple access system is called "time
division multiple access system." This TDMA system
implements multiple accesses by allowing a plurality of
stations to use carriers of the same frequency,
converting signals transmitted from those stations to
intermittent signals (here, referred to as "burst
signals") and aligning the burst signals of those
stations in such a way that they do not collide with each
other on the time scale.However, the TDMA system has the difficulty in fully
suppressing interference with other stations and this 
originates various problems such as increasing the
number of interference signals as the number of
multiplexing stations increases, making it difficult to
acquire synchronization, deteriorating the
communication quality and making communications
impossible. If interference with other stations
described above can be fully suppressed, it will be
possible to improve the frequency utilization efficiency,
improve the communication quality of each station in the
same cell (area) and increase its capacity (multiplexing
number or the number of channel accesses).On the other hand, the adaptive array antenna is
a system that determines a weight of each antenna output
based on a control algorithm and controls directivity
according to changes in the surrounding conditions. In
the array antenna made up of a plurality of antennas,
combining antenna outputs with an amplitude/phase shift
added changes array directivity.This adaptive array antenna is explained with
reference to FIG.18. FIG.18 shows an overall
configuration of a reception adaptive array antenna. In
FIG.18, antenna outputs 1802 from a plurality of antennas
1801 are multiplied by weights 1803 and combined into
array output 1804. Here, weights are controlled by
weight control section 1807 based on the following 3
pieces of information:
1 ○ Combined array output (1805)2 ○ Each antenna output (1802) 3 ○ Advance knowledge of desired signal (1806)
There are also cases where combined array output (1805)
is not used
