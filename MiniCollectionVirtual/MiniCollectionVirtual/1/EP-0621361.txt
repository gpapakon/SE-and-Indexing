<ABSTRACT>
The method serves for making a carrier tape stretchable highly elastically in the longitudinal direction on crochet galloon machines or Raschel machines, the finished carrier tape having tape portions (A, M) of differing width (B, b) which succeed one another in the longitudinal direction. Transitional regions (Ü) of changing width are provided between the tape portions (A, M) of differing width. At least two sets of warp threads (1, 2) run in the longitudinal direction of the tape. The warp threads (2) of one set are highly elastic. The warp threads (1) of the other set are laid as stitch wales. At least two sets of weft threads (3, 4) of differing stretchability are inserted. The highly elastic weft threads (3) of one set are laid under pretension in the carrier-tape portions (A) of small width (b). The non-stretchable inelastic weft threads (4) of the other set are laid in the carrier-tape portions (M) having the larger width (B). The weft threads (3, 4) of the two sets are inserted as weft in the transitional region (Ü) of the carrier-tape portions (A, M) having the different widths.

A method for the manufacture on crochet galloon machines or raschel knitting machines
of a shoulder strap stretchable in a highly resilient manner in the longitudinal direction,

the finished shoulder strap having strap portions (A, M) of differing width (B, b)
arranged successively in the longitudinal direction and having transition regions (Ü) of

varying width arranged between the strap portions (A, M) of differing width (B, b),
characterised in that at least two groups of warp threads (1, 2) are laid in the longitudinal

direction of the strap, the warp threads (2) of one group being highly resilient and
running lengthwise through the shoulder strap and the warp threads (1) of another group

being laid as wales, in that at least two groups of weft threads (3, 4) having differing
stretching ability are laid-in, the highly resilient weft threads (3) of one group being laid

with pre-tensioning in the shoulder strap portions of narrow width (b) and the non-stretchable,
non-resilient weft threads (4) of another group being laid in the shoulder

strap portions of greater width (B), and the weft threads (3, 4) of the at least two groups
being laid-in as weft in the transition region (Ü) between the shoulder strap portions (A,

M) having differing widths (B, b).
A female-underclothing shoulder strap with successive strap portions (A, M) of differing
width (B, b) which has been manufactured on a crochet galloon machine or raschel

knitting machine in accordance with the method according to Claim 1, in which shoulder
strap the width (B) of the longitudinal central region (M) is greater than the widths (b) of

the shoulder strap portions (A) to either side thereof, transition regions (Ü) of varying
width lie between the shoulder strap portions (A, M) of differing width (B, b) and the

shoulder strap has warp threads (1, 2) and weft threads (3, 4) placed transversely to the
latter, characterised in that at least two groups of warp threads (1, 2) are provided and at

least the warp threads (2) of one group are highly resilient and run lengthwise through
the shoulder strap and the warp threads (1) of another group are laid to form wales, and

at least two groups of weft threads (3, 4) of differing stretching ability are provided, the
weft threads (3) of one group being laid in the shoulder strap portions (A) of narrow

width (b) in a highly resilient manner and with pre-tensioning and the weft threads (4) of
another group being laid in the longitudinal central region (M) of the shoulder strap of

greater width (B) in a non-resilient manner, and the weft threads (3, 4) of the at least two 
groups being placed as weft in the transition region (Ü) between the shoulder strap

portions (A, M) having differing widths (B, b).
A shoulder strap in accordance with Claim 2 manufactured on a crochet galloon machine
or a raschel knitting machine, characterised in that the highly resilient weft threads (3)

and the non-resilient weft threads (4) run through the wide shoulder strap portion (M)
and the narrow shoulder strap portions (A) respectively in a substantially straight manner

without transverse displacement in the longitudinal direction.
A shoulder strap in accordance with Claim 2 manufactured on a crochet galloon machine
or raschel knitting machine, characterised in that the warp threads (1) laid to form wales

are non-resilient.
A shoulder strap in accordance with Claim 2 manufactured on a crochet galloon machine
or a raschel knitting machine, characterised in that the highly resilient warp threads (2)

are interwoven with the wales.
A shoulder strap in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 5 manufactured on a crochet
galloon machine or a raschel knitting machine, characterised in that the weft threads (3,

4) are laid over the entire width of the strap.
A shoulder strap in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 6 manufactured on a crochet

galloon machine or a raschel knitting machine, characterised in that, in addition to the
two groups of warp threads (1, 2) and weft threads (3, 4) of different stretching ability

present in each case, further threads or thread groups are interwoven in a pattern.
