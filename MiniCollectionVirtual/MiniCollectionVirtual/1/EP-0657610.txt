<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a threshold 1 consisting of metal, in particular light metal, for frames of sliding or lifting/sliding windows and doors or the like, which threshold has a running rail 10 which exibits a guide web 6 for the grooved rollers 8 of sash-side/leaf-side carriages 9. The fundamental feature here is that a guide web 6 is directly formed fixedly or integrally - that is to say with material connection - on the upper side of the threshold 1, that said guide web 6 exhibits, over its entire length to the upper side of the threshold 1, undercuts 15 and 16 and that a running-rail hollow profile 21, provided on its underside with a longitudinal gap 20 and bearing a guide web 7 on its upper side, may, if required, be latched directly to the undercuts 15 and 16 on the guide web 6 of the threshold 1.

<CLAIMS>
A bottom sill (1) or cover profile made of metal,
particularly light metal, for fixed frames of sliding

or lifting and sliding windows or doors or the like,
comprising a rail (10, 11) having a guide web for the

grooved runners (8) of carriages (9) on the leaves,
characterised in that the guide web (6) is formed

directly and immovably or in one piece, i.e. of the
same material, on the top surface of the bottom sill

(1) or cover profile; in that the guide web (6) has
undercuts (15, 16) along its entire length towards the

top surface of the bottom sill (1) or cover profile;
and in that a rail hollow profile (21, 25) formed with

a longitudinal gap (20, 27) on its underside and
bearing a guide web (7) on its top surface can be

locked directly to the undercuts (15, 16) on the guide
web (6) of the bottom sill (1) or cover profile.
A bottom sill or cover profile according to claim
1, characterised in that the rail hollow profile (21)

has an approximately trapezoidal cross-section with a
base wall (22, 22) containing the longitudinal gap (20)

at its centre.
A bottom sill (1) or cover profile according to
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the hollow profile

(21) is of extruded light metal (Fig. 2).
A bottom sill (1) or cover profile according to
claim 3, characterised in that the extruded light-metal

profile has a supporting web (23) in its interior above
the longitudinal gap (20). 
A bottom sill (1) or cover profile according to
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the hollow profile

(21) is made of shaped special-steel flat material
(Fig. 3).
A bottom sill (1) or cover profile according to
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the high rail (11)

is formed by a plastic profile (25) which on its
underside has a longitudinal groove (27) complementary

with the profile of the guide web (6) of the flat rail
(9), whereas on its top surface it bears a guide web

(7) reinforced by a longitudinally slotted special-steel
sleeve (26).
A bottom sill (1) according to any of claims 1 to
6, characterised in that it comprises an outer tubular

or box profile (2), an inner tubular or box profile (3)
and connecting profiles (4 and 5) positively coupling

the other said profiles together, wherein the tubular
or box profiles (2 and 3) are extruded from light metal

whereas the connecting profiles (4, 5) are extruded
from plastic material and form a heat-insulating

coupling between the tubular or box profiles (2 and 3).
A bottom sill (1) according to any of claims 1 to
7, wherein a detachable rail (12) is provided for

securing to the bottom sill and optionally has an
integrally-formed guide web (6), characterised in that

a filling profile portion (28) is integrally formed at
least on the longitudinal side of the detachable rail

(12) facing the outer tubular or box profile (2) and on
its underside has supporting ribs (29) for fitting on

to the inner tubular or box profile (3), and the
filling-profile portion (28) is designed so as to be 

longitudinally cuttable or divisible parallel to its
supporting ribs (29).
