<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a seed drill, the seed coulters (1, 21) of which are not only drawn in the direction of travel (P), but, during the travel of the seed drill in a straight line, are also moved transversely to the direction of travel (P), in such a way that the seed is placed not in straight rows, but in wavy rows. At the same time, a spreading effect can be achieved transversely to the direction of advance as a result of the transverse acceleration of the seed coulters (1, 21); particularly on the crests of the waves, the spreading material is spread beyond the (geometrical) wavy line generated by the seed coulters (1, 21), with the result that broadcast sowing is achieved.
