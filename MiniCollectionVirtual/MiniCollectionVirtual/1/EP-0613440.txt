<ABSTRACT>
A buoy for use in loading or unloading of a flowable medium, especially oil, the buoy (2) at its lower end being arranged for connection to at least one transfer line (6) and further being arranged to be introduced into a submerged downwardly open receiving space in a floating vessel (1), and the buoy (2) in operation forming a transfer connection between the transfer line (6) and a tube system (41) on the vessel. The buoy (2) comprises an outer buoyancy member (30) arranged for releasable locking to the receiving space (3) of the vessel (1) by means of a locking mechanism (56, 57) arranged therein, and centrally in the outer member (30) a rotatably mounted member (31) which forms a passage (32) for medium and at its ends is arranged for connection to the transfer line (6) and the tube system (41) on the vessel (1), respectively. The buoy (2) at its upper end is connected to a means for hoisting and introducing the buoy into the receiving space (3) of the vessel (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system including
a buoy and a receiving space in a floating vessel, the
receiving space being downwardly open and being adapted
to receive the buoy, and the buoy being adapted to
transfer a flowable medium between a transfer line
connected to the buoy and a pipe system on the vessel,
the buoy comprising an outer buoyancy member having an
outer shape which is at least partly complementary to the
inner shape of the receiving space and which is arranged
to be releasably secured in the receiving space by means
of a locking mechanism provided therein, a central member
on which the outer member is rotatably mounted, the
central member providing a passage for the flowable
medium, and being arranged for anchoring to the sea bed
so that the buoy is kept submerged at a desired depth
when not in use, and a line means at the upper end of the
buoy for hoisting the buoy into the receiving space by
means of a line lowered therefrom.There are previously known various buoy loading
systems of the type comprising a submerged buoy which,
during operation, is received in a downwardly open
receiving space on a floating vessel. As examples of
prior art reference can be made to e.g. the US patent
specifications 4 490 121 and 4 604 961.The first-mentioned patent specification shows a
mooring system in the form of a buoy loading system
which, in some of the illustrated embodiments, comprises
a buoy of the above-mentioned type. Thus, the buoy
comprises an outer buoyancy member which is arranged for
releasable securing in the receiving space, and a central
member on which the outer member is rotatably mounted,
the central member being anchored to the sea bed, so that
the vessel may turn about the central member when the 
transfer line for transfer of medium, and the upper end
is connected via a coupling unit to a pipe system on the
vessel. In this known system the receiving space for the
buoy is arranged in an arm projecting from and being
fastened to the vessel above the water surface, so that
the buoy, when this is placed in the receiving 
space, is lifted partly or in its entirety out of the water.
Thus, both the receiving space and the buoy are subjected to the
possibly rough or stormy surface conditions. It will be clear
that such a system is subject to substantial weather limitations
and will not be able to be operative in rather high sea, both
because of practical difficulties in connection and disconnection,
and because of lacking security for the crew under
difficult conditions with wind

<CLAIMS>
A system including a buoy and a receiving space in a
floating vessel, the receiving space being downwardly

open and being adapted to receive the buoy, and the buoy
being adapted to transfer a flowable medium between a

transfer line (6) connected to the buoy and a pipe system
(41) on the vessel (1), the buoy (2) comprising an outer

buoyancy member (30; 60) having an outer shape which is
at least partly complementary to the inner shape of the

receiving space (3) and which is arranged to be
releasably secured in the receiving space (3) by means of

a locking mechanism (56, 57) provided therein, a central
member (31; 61) on which the outer member is rotatably

mounted, the central member providing a passage (32; 62)
for the flowable medium, and being arranged for anchoring

to the sea bed so that the buoy is kept submerged at a
desired depth when not in use, and a line means (20) at

the upper end of the buoy for hoisting the buoy into the
receiving space by means of a line lowered therefrom,

characterized in that the receiving space (3) is provided
with a sealing flange (50) arranged to form sealing

contact with a cooperating sealing surface (49) on the
outer buoyancy member of the buoy (2), to form a seal

against the surrounding sea when the outer member is
secured in the receiving space (3), the receiving space

being submerged, that the outer buoyancy member (30) is
provided with a downwardly facing abutment edge (18) for

engagement with locking elements (56) attacking from
below and forming part of said locking mechanism, and
