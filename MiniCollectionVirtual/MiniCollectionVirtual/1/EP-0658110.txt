<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of pharmaceutical
compositions containing norastemizole. These compositions
possess potent antihistaminic activity and are useful in
treating allergic rhinitis
while avoiding adverse effects associated with the
administration of other antihistamines, such as astemizole,
including but not limited to cardiac arrhythmias, drowsiness,
nausea, fatique, weakness and headache. Also, these
compositions may be in combination with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
agents or other non-narcotic analgesics;
The aforementioned combinations may
optionally include
a decongestant.The active compound of these compositions and
methods is a metabolic derivative of astemizole. Chemically,
this derivative is norastemizole. This compound is described in 
Kamei et al., Arzneimittel-Forschung/Drug Research, 41: 932-36
(1991).Astemizole is an antagonist of the H-1 histamine
receptor protein. Histamine receptor proteins occur in two
well-identified forms in tissues as H-1 and H-2 receptors. The
H-1 receptors are those that mediate the response antagonized by
conventional antihistamines. H-1 receptors are present, for
example, in the ileum, the skin, and the bronchial smooth muscle
of man and other mammals. Astemizole antagonizes the effect of
histamine in the guinea pig isolated ileum, suppresses
histamine-induced whealing in the skin of guinea pigs, and
protects against histamine induced bronchoconstriction in the
guinea pig.Through H-2 receptor-mediated responses, histamine
stimulates gastric acid secretion in mammals and the
chronotropic effect in isolated mammalian atria. Astemizole has
no effect on histamine-induced gastric acid secretion, nor does
it alter the chronotropic effect of histamine on atria. Thus,
astemizole has no apparent effect on the H-2 histamine receptor.Astemizole is well absorbed but is extensively
metabolized. See Uchiyama et al., Pharmacometrics, 40: 77-93
(1990). Three main metabolites have been identified, and all of
the metabolites are reported to have antihistaminic activity.
See Kamei et al., Arzneimittel-Forschung/Drug Research, 41: 932-36
(1991).On the basis of its antihistaminic activity,
researchers evaluated the pharmacological effects of astemizole
in man. Clinical trials of efficacy indicated that astemizole
is an effective H-1 antagonist. See Howarth, Clin. Exp.
Allergy, 20 (Suppl. 2): 31-41 (1990).Weintraub et al., Hosp. Formul., 22: 918-27 (1987)
describes clinical efficacy of astemizole in the treatment of
both seasonal and perennial allergies. It
