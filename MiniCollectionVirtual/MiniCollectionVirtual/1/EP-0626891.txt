<ABSTRACT>
An entry nozzle for transporting liquid metal from a tundish to a mould for the continuous casting of thin slab disposed therebelow, wherein the nozzle (1) has a hollow channel (7) therethrough, and at least at its lower outlet end, is, in plan section, of large aspect ratio of width to thickness, and is hollow substantially across its width, the entry nozzle being provided at positions at its lower outlet end arranged in operation to be submerged within the casting mould, with at least one exit port (8, 9, 10, 11) from the hollow channel disposed on each elongate side of the nozzle, and, with the nozzle in its operational disposition, so shaped as to direct metal into the mould from the nozzle transverse to its vertical disposition. With the process in its operating state the controlled effective liquid metal pressure head of the metal in the tundish provides a flow of such metal to the mould that, with the extraction rate of the solidifying metal from the metal forming means, creates a required level of metal within the mould.

<DESCRIPTION>
 _Method and device for pouring molten metalThis invention relates to continuous casting nozzles, and more particularly to submerged entry nozzles for use with narrowly rectangular plan section continuous casting moulds for use in producing thin slabs or direct cast strip, together with arrangements for liquid metal delivery utilising such nozzles.The continuous casting of such slabs of relatively large aspect ratio of width to thickness is carried out by pouring (teeming) molten metal from a tundish down into (in plan view) an elongate rectangular cavity or mould, the long walls of which are defined by a pair of driven rolls one on either side of the cavity or mould by means of which the pool of solidifying steel is commenced in its 

downward solidification path of travel, and the end walls of which are defined by, for example, appropriately shaped plates abutting the ends of the rolls.Passage of the molten metal from the tundish to the casting mould is usually via a nozzle attached at its inlet end to the base of the tundish, and having its outlet end submerged within the pool of molten metal within the cavity or mould.In such continuous casting apparatus the design of the input nozzle to the mould is of great importance. Thus, with commonly used circular section nozzles, often mounted at their upper end on metal flow control valves external to the tundish, and with such an elongate mould configura ion, serious difficulties can arise from metal travelling into the mould from the nozzle with different velocities at different dispositions so that whereas at some locations vigorous stirring of the incoming metal within the mould occurs, at others far less stirring occurs leading to what are in effect dead spots. Such variation can easily result in uneven solidification of the thin slab leading to surface defects of the product. Again>. the nozzle design can result in the metal emerging from the nozzle into the mould with a high velocity which, if the stream of the metal is directed at newly solidified steel on the surface of the mould wall, increases the risk of uneven solidification and product surface imperfection.Yet again, and somewhat conversely , problems arise if stirring within the mould is such that stirring velocity 

close to the upper liquid surface of the pool is inadequate, whereby surface freezing becomes likely, which must be avoided since a frozen "skull" on the pool surface can be pulled into the driving rolls, possibly dragging the nozzle with it. A further potential problem is that
