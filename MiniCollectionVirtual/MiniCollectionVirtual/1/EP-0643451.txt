<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) comprises a housing 
(14) having latch members (143) at both ends and a pair 

of metal fasteners (16) detachably clamped on the latch 
members (143). The housing has a longitudinal groove 

(141) for receiving a daughter board. The metal fastener 
(16) includes a fixing section (161) and a spring section 

(162) which substantially extends uprightly therefrom. 
The fixing section (161) clamps on the housing (10). The 

spring section (162) is provided with a restriction leg 
(1621) to prevent over-stressing and a slot (1622) which 

are formed by punching. The restriction leg (1621) is 
substantially vertical to the surface of the spring 

section (162). When the metal fastener (16) clamps on 
the housing (10), a rib (1432) provided on the latch 

member (143) fits the slot (1622) of the spring section 
(162) so as to prevent the side shifting and rotation of 

the metal fastener (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical connector for connecting together
two circuit boards and to a latching arrangement for use in such a connector.An electrical connector is a device which electrically and mechanically
connects, for example, a memory board called a "mother board" to a daughter board
such as a single-in-line memory module (SIMM). A conventional electrical connector
comprises a housing to be mounted on a mother board and one pair of metal latch
members. Each latch member may be inserted into a latch receiving member provided
near one end of the housing for holding a daughter board. The housing has a slot for
receiving a base end of the daughter board. Contact terminals are provided in the slot
to enable electrical connection between the mother and daughter boards.The daughter board which is inserted into the slot is rotated along an axis of
the slot between the paired metal latch members. When the side edges of the daughter
board come into contact with the metal latch members, the paired metal latch members
can be elastically flexed away from each other. The daughter board reaches a
predetermined position, and the paired metal latch members elastically return to their
initial positions. Thus, the daughter board is held in a sandwiched relation. However,
the fixing of the metal latch members is by way of "insertion". After repeated attaching
and detaching of the daughter board, the metal latch members may become loose and
lose stability and the clamping force against the daughter board suffers. Examples of 
such connectors are the subject of issued patents US-A-4 986 765, US-A-5 112 242,
US-A-4 995 825 and US-A-5 169 333. In US-A-4 986 765 the connector is provided
with latch members manufactured from a material having appropriate resilience and
strength characteristics and to a design suitable for tolerating a wider range of daughter
board widths. The latch members may also be used to establish electrical connection
with the daughter board.Furthermore, the latch receiving members must be complex and large enough
to receive the insertion of the metal latch members. More material may be needed due
to a larger outer configuration of the housing. It may not be easy to mold a housing of
such a complex configuration. As a result, the electrical connector is complex and
expensive to manufacture.Due to the drawbacks discussed above, one of the objects of this invention is to
provide an electrical connector that is simpler and easier to manufacture at a low cost.
