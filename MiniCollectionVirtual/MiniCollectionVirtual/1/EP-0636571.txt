<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle jack with a cross shaft (7) made out of a metal - 
sheet on a progressive dieing press, which is used either alone or 

in combination with a holder plate (25), also obtained by progressive 
dieing out of a metal sheet. The jack also has a special connection 

between the spindle or worm screw (4), the worm screw head (9) 
and one portion (5) of the crank handle, as well as a protection for 

the nut, based on a set of metal rings that reinforce its two side 
protuberances (37). The whole jack improves the technical features 

and provides a cheaper general item.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a vehicle jack of the mechanical
type, which operate based on the action of a crank handle that causes
a threaded spindle or worm screw to turn in such a way that it raises
or lowers one arm with which the jack is provided, depending on the -
direction in which the crank handle and the said worm screw are turned.In these mechanical jacks, the worm screw passes through a
cross shaft situated at the opposite end of the worm screw to the crank
handle, with this cross shaft, on occasions, being connected to a holder
plate on which the vehicle body is supported.These cross shafts are usually made of one single solid -
part, sometimes made of plastic, which means that they are excessively
heavy and also their cost is considerable. When the cross shafts form
part of the holder plates themselves, they are also usually made of one
single piece of plastic material, which in general terms also causes -
similar disadvantages.Moreover, the worm screw head on conventional jacks and the
bent or cranked end of the crank handle connected to this head also -
have the disadvantage that they are complicated to assemble and costly
to make. Thus, to limit the turning of the said cranked end in order
that the arm of the crank handle remains perpendicular to the axis of
the worm screw, the end of the worm screw is turned (machined) for a -
certain length and then swaged in order to form a broad end with which
the cranked end makes contact by means of a longitudinal protrusion formed
by stamping. Apart from this, and so that this cranked end can be
inserted into the fork, it becomes necessary to make a specially-shaped
hole in one wing of the said fork, and finally to make a lug on the -
protruding end of the said cranked area.Another disadvantage of known jack is the nut in which the
threaded worm screw is lodged in order to raise or lower the jack. In
recent times, these nuts are made of plastic, with their ends being - 
housed in holes cut in the U-shaped sections that are used
for the arms of the jack. When these holes are made, it happens
that on numerous occasions, the ends of the nut are
sleared off due to the irregularities of the cross-section of
the said holes, which concentrate stresses on a small portion
of the cutting cross-section.In those vehicle jacks which have a mobile base connected
with a cross shaft on which the said base turns, with
both being placed at the end of the arms, it happens that the
other arm, or raising arm, thast includes the holder plate
to support the vehicle body,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Vehicle jack, which has arms (1,2) connected by a
threaded worm screw (4) operated at one of its ends by a

crank handle (5), with a cross shaft (7) that receives the
end of the worm screw and on the end of which a holder plate

can be fixed, with a nut (36) operated by the worm screw,
in which the handle has a specially shaped end to join it to

a part with a special design on the end of the spindle, with
solid linchpins for arranging the grip on the corresponding

arm, which is characterized by:

a cross shaft (7), obtained from sheet metal and by
pressing in progressive dies, which is situated between the

wings of the arms (1) of the jack in holes cut in the said
wings,
a holder plate (25), with a generally "U" shape, obtained
by the progressive die pressing of sheet metal, in

which aligned holes are cut in its wings (26,27) in order to
receive the ends of the cross shaft, and with these wings

(26,27) being round the exterior of the wings on the arms (1),
a worm screw head (9), with a U-shaped cross-section,
with aligned holes (34) in its wings (35) and side protuberances

(10) on both sides, made with the material removed to
make the said holes, which extend to both sides of the base

of the head (9) and are aligned with it, in the base of which
a square hole (44) is made to receive the threaded end of the

worm screw (4), which is then welded to the hole,
a portion (11) of the crank handle (5) housed between
the wings (35) of the head (9), which is flat, with one

end outside one of the wings (35) which is provided with a
protuberance (12) and is limited in turning by one of the 

protuberances (10) of the head (9),
a nut (36), whose transverse protuberances (37) are
housed in holes in the wings of the arm (39) by meand of metal

reinforcing rings (38) which are around the said protuberances,
a protuberance (50) in the form of a hook, made on
the lifting arm (31) and which protrudes downwards towards

the base (48)
Vehicle jack, in accordance with claim 1, characterized
in that the cross shaft (7) is provided with a geometry with its

circular ends (19) profiled or trimmed into straight areas (72) like
chords and a central area (20) with a rectangular cross-section and

with two of its opposite faces pierced by aligned holes (23, 24), one
of whose sides is established as a continuation of the straight portion

of the ends, with trunco-conical areas (31) being established on
both sides between the centre and the ends.
Vehicle jack, in accordance with claim 1, characterized
in that the free ends of the cross shaft (7) are provided with -

protuberances (18) which are folded directly over the arms (16, 17) of
the jack.
Vehicle jack, in accordance with claim 1, characterized
in that the cross shaft (7) is lodged in a widened portion (33) of the

arm (31) of the jack, with windows or openings (43) being provided in
these arms, into which the legs (33) are folded inwards once that the

cross shaft has been inserted.
Vehicle jack, in accordance with claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that the cross shaft (7) is induction welded to the aligned

holes in the holder plate, with these holes being provided with a -
series of radial lugs (29), against which the front ends (19) of the -

cross shaft are lodged.
Vehicle jack, in accordance with claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that the aligned holes in the holder plate (25) take a -

in that the reinforcing rings (38) fitted onto the protuberances -

(37) of the nut (36) include a fixing element between the two, arranged

Vehicle jack, in accordance with claims 1 and 7, characterized
in that the reinforcing rings are fixed to the protuberances

internal lugs (42) in the surface of the protuberances.
Vehicle jack, in accordance with claim 1, characterized
in that a holder plate (13) is provided, which is equipped with

some protruding fins (43) at one longitudinal end which are folded -
back over the outsides of the arms (14) once that the holder plate has

been fitted.
