<ABSTRACT>
Toothbrush with two housing members (1, 2) which are pivotable relative to one another and of which a first housing member (1) serves as a handle and comprises a drive unit (4) for driving a drive shaft (5), and a second housing member (2) is provided with a brush head (3) which can be driven by the drive shaft and can pivot the second housing member (2) relative to the drive shaft (5) about a hinge axis (6). In order to warn the user against excessive pressure during brushing the tooth brush is provided with a spring structure having at least one spring (14) which acts between the second housing member (2) and the drive shaft (5). On use of the toothbrush, the second housing member (2) can be pivoted about the hinge axis (6) relative to the first housing member (1) counter to a pressing force exerted by the spring (14), and the spring springs back when a predetermined threshold for the pressing force is exceeded and the hinge axis is located in the second housing member and simultaneously forms part of the mechanical coupling between the drive shaft and the second housing member.
