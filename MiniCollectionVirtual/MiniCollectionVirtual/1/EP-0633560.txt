<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus 
capable of recording video, audio and other information 

on a magnetic tape by, for example, the helical 
scanning method. A rotary head is rotated at an m-fold 

speed to record intermittent tracks on the magnetic 
tape so that real-time simultaneous monitoring 

is performed. By high-speed dubbing due to high-density 
intermittent recording and by increasing the 

number of repetition of track scanning, the information 
is recorded and reproduced simultaneously with a 

plurality of channels. Any tracking error is detected 
to form a continuous and uniform track pattern. With 

this intermittent comb-shaped recording, reciprocating 
recording and reproducing can be realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic recording
and reproducing apparatus for recording video and
audio information on a magnetic tape in a helically
scanning system.For accurately recording a digital video signal
and a digital audio signal by a digital video tape recorder,
it has hitherto necessary to confirm the state
of recording by reproducing the recorded data soon
after recording, namely, to perform simultaneous
monitoring. FIG. 10 shows one example of a tape format for a 
magnetic recording reproducing apparatus which enables
reciprocating reproducing, the tape format being described
in, for example, a book "NHK Home Video Description"
(page 213) issued from Japan Broadcasting
Association (Nippon Hoso Kyokai).A magnetic tape 510 is 1/2 inch wide, on which
surface each track is formed in the following format.
Specifically, a video track 511-V1 is a track on and
from which video signals are to be recorded and
reproduced in the direction of forward tape feed; an
audio track 511-A1 is a track on and from which audio
signals are to be recorded and reproduced in the
direction of forward tape feed; a video track 511-V2
is a track on and from which video signals are to be
recorded and reproduced in the direction of reverse
tape feed; and an audio track 511-A2 is a track on and
from which audio signals are to be recorded and
reproduced in the direction of reverse tape feed.The object of this prior art apparatus using
such a tape format is to enable long-time recording
and recording and reproducing band of audio signals by
reciprocatingly use the magnetic tape 510.By multiplying the rate of magnetic tape feed
about two times, the tape format of FIG. 10 can be
formed within a width (1/4 inch) which is a half of
the magnetic tape 510 having a 1/2-inch width as used 
in the VHS method or such. The formed tape format includes
the video tracks 511-V1, 511-V2 for recording
and reproducing in the helically scanning method and
the audio tracks 511-A1, 511-A2 for recording and
reproducing on linear tracks.For example, using the lower half (1/4 inch) of
the magnetic tape 510 during forward tape feed, the
video signals are recorded on the video track 511-V1,
and the audio signals are recorded on the audio track
511-A1.Then, when the direction of the magnetic tape
feed becomes relatively reversed by turning the magnetic
tape 510 inside out, the video signals and the
audio signals are recorded on the video track 511-V2
and the audio track 511-A1, using the lower half (1/4
inch) of the magnetic tape 510.Concerning the
