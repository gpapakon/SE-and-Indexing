<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
forming coatings on substrates and the substrates coated 

thereby. The method comprises applying a coating comprising 
hydrogen silsesquioxane resin and a filler on a substrate and 

heating the coated substrate at a temperature sufficient to 
convert the hydrogen silsesquioxane resin to a ceramic 

coating. This method is especially valuable for forming 
coatings on electronic devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
forming coatings using compositions comprising hydrogen
silsesquioxane resin and fillers. These coatings are useful
on substrates for electronic devices.The use of hydrogen silsesquioxane resins
(H-resins) to derive ceramic coatings on substrates such as
electronic devices is known in the art. For instance, U.S.
Patent No. 4,756,977 discloses a process for forming a silica
coating on an electronic substrate wherein a solution of
H-resin is applied to a substrate followed by heating the
coated substrate in air at a temperature in the range of
200-1000°C. This reference, however, does not describe the
use of fillers within the coating.However, the use of fillers within ceramic coatings
is also known in the art. For instance, U.S. Patent
No. 3,986,997 describes a composition comprising an acidic
dispersion of colloidal silica and hydroxylated
silsesquioxane in an alcohol-water medium which can be used
to apply transparent abrasion resistant coatings on a variety
of substrates. The reference, however, does not describe the
use of H-resins nor the application of a ceramic coating on
an electronic substrate.We have now found that useful protective coatings
of ceramics can be formed from compositions comprising
H-resins and fillers.The present invention relates to a method of
forming a coating on an electronic substrate and the substrates coated
thereby. The method comprises first applying a composition
comprising H-resin and a filler on the electronic substrate. The coated
substrate is then heated at a temperature of 50 to 1000°C. 
sufficient to convert the composition to a ceramic coating.The present invention also relates to the coating
composition comprising H-resin and the filler diluted in a
solvent that is used to form the coatings.The present invention is based on our finding that
desirable coatings can be formed from a composition
comprising H-resin and a filler. Coatings derived therefrom
can be thicker (e.g., greater than 40 micrometers) compared
to those formerly derived from unfilled hydrogen
silsesquioxane resins (e.g., less than 2 micrometers). They
can also have a variety of electrical properties depending on
the coating (e.g. from coatings with a dielectric constant
(DK) of less than 4 up to completely conductive coatings) and
they can be crack and pore-free. In addition, high
temperature firing of the coatings to burn-out carbon is not
necessary since H-resin is nearly carbon-free.Because of the above advantages, these coatings are
particularly
