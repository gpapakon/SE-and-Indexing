<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a wall for the cabin of a varnishing line, wherein said wall comprises in a traditional way different wall members (1, 2). Each wall member (1, 2) comprises a support frame (3) formed by vertical stands (4, 5) and horizontal crossbars (6, 7, 8, 9) made from profiled members of sheet metal. The panels are attached using the stands (4, 5) and the crossbars (6, 7, 8, 9) and are covered with plates (10, 11, 12). The vertical stands (4, 5) at least include a profiled member having a rectangular basic geometrical shape. However, two of the legs (15, 16) of the profiled member, i.e. the external leg extending vertically relative to the associated plate (11) and the outer leg (16) which is parallel to said plate (11) respectively, do not extend on the entire length on the corresponding side of the rectangle. The inside of the stands (4, 5) can thus be accessed and mounting members can then be placed thereon. At least one chamfered area (40) is formed on the shortened leg (16) which is parallel to the plate (11), wherein said area (40) also extends up to the corresponding plate (11). The chamfered area (40) provides mechanical rigidity to the corresponding stand (4, 5) and is also used for fixing a cap (18) which is inserted between the shortened legs (16), which are parallel to the plates (11), of adjacent stands (4, 5).The cap thus provide a flushing cover of the access opening leading into the inner spaces of the two adjacent stands (4, 5).

Wall for the booth of a coating plant, consisting of
a plurality of wall elements, each of which comprises:


a) a frame (3) consisting of at least two vertical posts
(4, 5) and at least two horizontal crosspieces (6 - 9);
b) at least one plate (10 - 12), which covers a zone spanned
by the posts and the crosspieces,

wherein
c) at least the posts consist of a bent metal sheet section,
the cross-sectional shape of which is basically rectangular,

wherein

ca) a first leg (13a, 13b), which is parallel to the
plate and adjacent to the latter, of the section

and a second leg (14a, 14b), which extends perpendicularly
to the first leg and points towards the

centre of the wall element, of the section extend
over the entire length of the corresponding side

of the rectangle, and
cb) a third leg (16a, 16b), which is parallel to the
plate yet distant from it, of the section and a

fourth leg (15a, 15b), which extends perpendicularly
from the first leg, of the section only extend

over a part of the length of the corresponding side
of the rectangle,

wherein furthermore 
d) adjacent wall elements each abut at the fourth legs
of adjacent posts and are connected together here such

that the free edges of the respective third legs of
the adjacent posts bound a slit-shaped common access

opening to the interiors of the two adjacent posts,
which opening can be closed off by a common, removable

cover (18),
characterised in that
e) a region (40) which is bent in the direction of the
plate (11) and which serves to mechanically stiffen

the post (4, 5) and secure the cover (18) is shaped
onto the third leg (16) of each post (4, 5).
Wall according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a
second bent region (4), extending parallel to the plate

(11), is shaped onto the first region, which is bent in
the direction of the plate (11), of the third leg (16)

of each post (4, 5)
Wall according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
cover (18) is a shaped sheet-metal part having a base

(18a) extending parallel to the plate (11) in the mounting
position and two lateral legs (18b, 18c) bent in the

direction of the plate (11).
Wall according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the cover can be elastically
locked to one of the bent regions of the third leg of

adjacent posts.
Wall according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the cover (18) is provided with
a rotary catch (19) which can be operated from outside, 

engages behind a bent region (4a) of at least one post
(5a, 4b) in a first position of rotation and is released

from this bent region (41) in a second position of rotation,
so that the cover (18) can be removed.
Wall according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 adjacent posts (4, 5) of adjacent

wall elements (1, 2) are each secured to one another by
a plurality of pairs of screw parts (20, 21) which are

each passed from outside through openings (22) in the
third legs (14) of adjacent posts (4, 5) and lie from

outside by way of heads (23, 24) against these legs (14),
wherein at least one (20) of the two screw parts is passed

through openings (33) in the fourth legs (15) of the two
adjacent posts (4, 5), and wherein one (20) of the two

screw parts is provided with an external thread and the
other (21) of the two screw parts with a complementary

threaded hole (26).
