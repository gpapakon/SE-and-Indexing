<ABSTRACT>
A two-step nucleic acid hybridization probe assay for certain types of human papilloma virus (HPV) associated with cervical cell dysplasia and malignancy comprises a fluid phase capture hybridization step in which amplified specific gene E6/E7 messenger RNA from a biological specimen is hybridized to a biotinylated capture reagent to form a complex, attachment of the capture reagent complex to a solid phase by reaction with immobilized streptavidin, a second hybridization step in which a virus type-specific enzyme-conjugated detection probe hybridizes with the complexed amplified messenger RNA, and detection of the complexed detection probe by color or fluorophor production following a wash of the solid phase and addition of an appropriate chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate. The assay has enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional tests and is specific for actual expression of HPV oncogenes in cervical specimens, and not merely indicative of viral presence.

<DESCRIPTION>
 HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS DETECTION ASSAYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a heterogeneous group of DNA viruses associated with a variety of proliferative lesions of the epithelium. Many of these lesions are benign such as those associated with HPV 6 and HPV 11, and are considered causative of such conditions as warts, and condylomas (see Gissman, Cane. Surv., 3: 161 (1984)). However, epidemiological and molecular studies implicate several high risk types that infect the genital tract associated with dysplasia and sometimes progress to cervical cancer (see, for example, Durst, et al., PNAS, 80: 3812 (1983)). High risk HPV types are predominately HPV 16 and HPV 18, with HPV 31, HPV 33, and HPV 35 being of lesser significance. More recently, another HPV type associated with malignancy, HPV 44, has been identified (Lorincz, U.S. Patent No. 4,849,331).HPV of any type is generally found in extremely low numbers in biological specimens. Therefore, molecular techniques must be performed for amplifying nucleic acid viral markers from very low copy number in a specimen to detectable levels. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been utilized to amplify HPV viral DNA in this manner, as disclosed in WO 90/02821, and Shibata, et al., J. Exp. Med., 167: 225 (DATE). Other applications of PCR to HPV diagnostics are Maitland, et al., May 

1988. Seventh International Papillomavirus Workshop, Abstract, p. 5 and Campione-Piccardo, et al., May 1988, Seventh International Papillomavirus Workshop. One major problem with PCR amplification of HPV is that these viruses are detectable as fortuitous passengers in a significant percentage of healthy women showing no evidence of any benign of malignant pathology. Percentage estimates of such passenger presence range 10% (see U.S. Patent No. 4,983,728) to as high as 60%. Detection of HPV per se is thus of limited diagnostic value.Many nucleic acid-based assays utilize the well-known sandwich configuration in a heterogeneous format. In this format a capture oligonucleotide is chemically conjugated to a solid support such as a microtiter well or bead, the sample is added, and the target nucleic acid having base homology to capture oligonucleotide is allowed to hybridize. After a wash (phase separation), a detection oligonucleotide hybridizes, and after a second wash to remove unhybridized detection oligonucleotide, the amount of tracer or reporter is measured, or the signal generating means produces a signal. For the details of such assays, refer to Ranki, U.S.
