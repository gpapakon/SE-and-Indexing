<ABSTRACT>
The purity and toughness of a batch of diamond grains is 
increased by separating a portion containing undesirable inclusions 

from a remaining higher purity portion and annealing the higher 
purity portion in a reducing atmosphere for a sufficient period of 

time to enhance the toughness of the higher purity portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of treating diamond
grains which are used for diamond tools.Diamond grains are typically used for the production of
diamond tools such as grinding wheels, dressing or truing tools for
grinding wheels, and saw blades.To function effectively and efficiently in certain tool
applications, particularly applications requiring diamond saw blades,
diamond grit having the highest strength (including high
temperature strength), toughness, and abrasion resistance is often
desirable. Techniques for bonding diamond to saw blades include
the utilization of nickel, cobalt, iron, and other metals and/or alloys
for sintering at elevated temperatures from 600 to approximately
1300 degrees Centigrade. At these temperatures, the strength of the
diamond may deteriorate. In a vacuum, mild surface graphitization
of diamond begins at temperatures above about 1000 degrees
Centigrade. In air, diamond will begin to oxidize at about 600
degrees Centigrade. At temperatures above 900 degrees Centigrade,
catalyst residues can lead to the regraphitization of diamond or
partial disintegration of the crystal due to the relatively large thermal
expansion of these metal residues.U.S. patent 5,035,771 to Borse describes a process where
diamonds in a iron, cobalt, or nickel powder are exposed to a
hydrogen atmosphere at a temperature above 700 degrees
Centigrade to etch pores in the surface of the diamond to give a
roughened surface for enhancing the bonding of the diamond to a 
saw or grinding wheel. As set forth in column 4, lines 50 to 52,
temperatures above 900 degrees Centigrade are disadvantageous
because the internal strength of the diamonds is reduced. U.S.
patent 4,174,380 to Strong et al relates to annealing diamond at a
temperature ranging from 1500 to 2200 degrees Centigrade under a
pressure which prevents graphitization. This process was designed
not to improve diamond strength, but rather to aggregate atomically
dispersed nitrogen to change the diamond color properties.A number of researchers have attempted to improve grit
diamond strength by heat treating (see Field, 1992, for overview),.
Dyer and Conradi (1972) report reducing the toughness index (TI) and
thermal toughness index (TTI) test strengths of synthetic diamond
after heating to 1400 K. Muhkin et al (1974) and Simkin (1982) also
reported strength loss in heating synthetic diamond. Uvarov et al
(1974) reported a strength increase for natural diamond as measured
by uniaxial compression test upon heating at temperatures
