<ABSTRACT>
A disc reproducing apparatus for reading out and 
reproducing information signals recorded on an information 

disc, such as an optical disc, and displaying the read out 
and reproduced information signals on display section, and 

a loading device for loading an information disc, such as 
an optical disc, or a disc table, in which both a disc 

proper and a disc cartridge comprised of a disc and a 
cartridge accommodating such disc may be loaded on the disc 

table. The disc player enables the information on the disc 
to be read out and reproduced and the read-out and 

reproducing information to be displayed as a visual 
information, and is reduced in size so as to be portable. 

The loading device enables both the disc cartridge and the 
disc proper to be loaded on the disc player.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disc player for reading out and
reproducing information signals recorded on an information disc,
such as an optical disc, and for displaying the read out and
reproduced information signals on a display section, and a
loading device whereby the information disc, such as an optical
disc, on a disc table, in which both a disc proper and a disc
cartridge comprised of a disc and a cartridge accommodating the
disc therein may be loaded on the disc table.An optical disc has so far been used as a recording medium
for recording musical sound information signals, image
information signals or the like information signals.The optical disc is comprised of a base plate of a synthetic
resin, such as a transparent polycarbonate resin, a recording
layer formed on the base plate, and a layer of a transparent
synthetic resin formed on the recording layer. Such optical disc
exhibits sufficient mechanical strength as compared with the
magnetic disc or the like formed by a film sheet as the base
material. The recording layer covered by the synthetic resin
exhibits sufficient durability against dust and dirt. Thus the 
so-called compact disc, which is an optical disc on which musical
sound signals or the like are recorded, is handled as a disc per
se, and loaded by itself on a disc player.On the optical disc, information signals are recorded at a
higher recording density. The information signals may be
rewritten with certain optical discs, or with magneto-optical
discs operating under the photomagnetic effects. With these
discs, deposition of only a small amount of dust and dirt on the
signal recording surface results in dropout in recording or
reproduction of the information signals to render it impossible
to maintain satisfactory recording and/or reproducing
characteristics.For this reason, this type of the optical disc is
accommodated in the main cartridge body and loaded in this state
on the disc player.Meanwhile, the disc player or the like apparatus in which
the optical disc per se is used as the recording medium is
designed so that only the disc per se may be loaded, whereas the
disc player in which the disc cartridge comprised of a main
cartridge body and an optical disc accommodated therein is used
as the recording medium is designed so that only the disc
cartridge may be loaded, while the disc proper cannot be loaded.In a disc player in which the optical disc is used as the
recording medium, it is presently tried to enable information
signals recorded on at least a plurality of optical
