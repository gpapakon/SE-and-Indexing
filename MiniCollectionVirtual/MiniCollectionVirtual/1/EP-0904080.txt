<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE OF THE INVENTIONINHIBITORS OF FARNESYL-PROTELN TRANSFERASEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, Ki4a-Ras, Ki4b-Ras and N-Ras) are part of a signalling pathway that links cell surface growth factor receptors to nuclear signals initiating cellular proliferation. Biological and biochemical studies of Ras action indicate that Ras functions like a G-regulatory protein. In the inactive state, Ras is bound to GDP. Upon growth factor receptor activation Ras is induced to exchange GDP for GTP and undergoes a conformational change. The GTP-bound form of Ras propagates the growth stimulatory signal until the signal is terminated by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras, which returns the protein to its inactive GDP bound form (D.R. Lowy and D.M. Willumsen, ΛΛAZ. Rev. Biochem. 62:851-891 (1993)). Mutated ras genes (Ha-rø_>, Ki4a-rα.s, Y Ab-ras and N-ras) are found in many human cancers, including colorectal carcinoma, exocrine pancreatic carcinoma, and myeloid leukemias. The protein products of these genes are defec¬ tive in their GTPase activity and constitutively transmit a growth stimulatory signal.Ras must be localized to the plasma membrane for both normal and oncogenic functions. At least 3 post-translational modifications are involved with Ras membrane localization, and all 3 modifications occur at the C-terminus of Ras. The Ras C-terminus contains a sequence motif termed a "CAAX" or "Cys-Aaa^Aaa-^-Xaa" box (Cys is cysteine, Aaa is an aliphatic amino acid, the Xaa is any amino acid) (Willumsen et al, Nature 570:583-586 (1984)). Depend¬ ing on the specific sequence, this motif serves as a signal sequence for the enzymes famesyl-protein transferase or geranylgerany I -protein transferase, which catalyze the alkylation of the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif with a C15 or C20 isoprenoid, respectively. (S. Clarke., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 67 :355-386 (1992); W.R. Schafer and J. Rine, Ann. Rev. Genetics 30:209-231 (1992)). The Ras protein is one of several proteins that are known to undergo post-translational famesylation. 

Other famesylated proteins include the Ras-related GTP-binding proteins such as Rho, fungal mating factors, the nuclear lamins, and the gamma subunit of transducin. James, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269, 14182 (1994) have identified a peroxisome associated protein Pxf which is also famesylated. James, et al., have also suggested that there are famesylated proteins of unknown structure and function in addition to those listed above.Inhibition of famesyl-protein transferase has
