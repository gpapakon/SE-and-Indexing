<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a turbulence insert of a headbox of a paper machine. The invention is characterised by the following features:   - provision is made of a bundle of channels for guiding stock suspension from a first region into a second region; - the channel bundle partly comprises edge-located channels which have no neighbouring channel on at least one long side and partly comprises central channels which have in each case at least one neighbouring channel on all long sides; - provision is made of at least two neighbouring, edge-located channels which are mutually connected over at least part of their length.

<CLAIMS>
Turbulence insert for the headbox of a paper machine having the following
features:


1.1 a tube nest which is surrounded by two side walls and at least two walls
extending over the machine width ("wide walls O, U"),
1.2 the tube nest comprises tubes which are adjacent to the wide walls (O, U)
("edge tubes"),
1.2 the wide walls (O, U) extend in flow direction over the downstream end of
the tube nest,

characterised by the following features:

1.4 between each wide wall (O, U) and the edge tubes located there is a gap
which permits a free flow over the machine width.
Turbulence insert according to claim 1, characterised in that the gap is
provided in the end region of the turbulence insert.
Turbulence insert according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the headbox
is a multi-layered headbox.
