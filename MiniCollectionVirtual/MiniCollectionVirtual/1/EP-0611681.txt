<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a motor vehicle, in particular utility vehicle, with a drive train with at least one permanently driven axle, at least one further engageable axle and lockable differentials. The engagement of the further axle(s) takes place by actuation on the part of the driver of an associated actuation element (11, 12, 13), the triggered measure being displayed in an ergonomically appropriate and clearly definable manner either on the said actuation element (11, 12, 13) itself or on a separate display (14). The system of symbols used here represents the drive train (4') and driven wheels and additionally drivable wheels (7', 8', 9', 10'). The respectively activated engagement states and locking states are indicated by thick bars and additionally by different colouring, e.g. green and red, whilst the drive states or locking states which are not activated or not actuated yet continue to be represented by thin bars only.

A motor vehicle, in particular a utility vehicle, having a drive train with at least one 
constantly driven axle, at least one further, engageable axle and lockable differentials, 

wherein the driving engagement of the further axle or axles and the locking of the differentials 
are releasable by the actuation of at least one associated actuation member by 

the driver and the activated driving and locking states are indicated optically, 
characterized 
in that
 a display (3; 14) simulating the driven wheels and the wheels to be additionally 
driven as well as the drive train of the motor vehicle symbolically by LED or 

LCD segments (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; 4', 5', 6', 7', 8', 9', 10') is associated with the actuation 
member (1A) or the actuation members (11, 12, 13), wherein the LED or LCD 

segments are presented in the said display (3, 14) in such an arrangement that 

a) driven wheels and released differential locks are indicated by bold lines, and 
b) non-driven wheels and non-released differential locks are indicated on the other hand 
by thin lines. 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the display (3) is an 
integral component of a switch (2) forming an actuation member (1A), by the respective 

actuation of which the switching of the axle or one of the further axles and the 
locking of one respective differential can be released in a defined sequence (Fig. 1). 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the display (14) is situated 
in the driver's field of vision, and this
 independent display (14) has associated 
therewith a plurality of actuation members (11, 12, 13) - one for a respective drive-switching 

function or a respective differential-locking function - of which each one 
comprises a switch (11', 12', 13') with a symbol (11'', 12'', 13'') showing the wheels and 

the drive train of the vehicle stylized, wherein the switching or locking action to be 
released is emphasized by bold lines, whereas the other symbol parts on the other hand 

are shown only in thin lines, and by the actuation of each switch (11', 12', 13') an 
addition of the symbol parts indicated thereon in bold lines can be made to the basic 

symbols of display segments activated in bold lines to correspond in shape in the display 
(14) and, in addition, of different colour, and emphasizing the drive switching and differential 

locking in an optically differentiated manner (Fig. 2). 
A motor vehicle according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 in  
 

general only the wheels of the constantly driven axle or axles are indicated in the display 
(3 and 14 respectively) by LED or LCD segments activated in bold lines and in a 

specific colour when the drive of the switchable axle or axles and the differential locks 
are not activated. 
A motor vehicle according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
a) the driven wheels of the vehicle and the wheels thereof engaged for driving are all 
shown in bold lines and in the same colour, for example green, whereas 
b) each differential locking is also shown in bold lines, but in a strongly contrasting 
colour, for example red, and therefore emphasized visually in a clearly differentiable 

manner 
 
in the display (3 and 14 respectively) by way of the LED or LCD segments thereof 
A motor vehicle according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the 
drive train of the vehicle is shown stylized in the display (3 and 14 respectively) by way 

of the LED or LCD segments thereof by a long line segment (4 and 4' respectively) 
activatable in bold lines or thin lines and by respective shorter line segments (5 and 5' 

respectively, 6 and 6' respectively) - arranged at right angles thereto, showing the axle 
or axles stylized and also activatable in bold lines or thin lines in the case where the said 

axle or axles are lockable by way of a differential - as well as by short line segments (7, 
8, 9, 10 and 7', 8', 9', 10' respectively) each attached to the ends of the shorter line 

segments (5 and 5' respectively, 6 and 6' respectively) and symbolizing the driven or 
drivable wheels, wherein the segments (7, 8 and 7', 8' respectively) showing non-steerable 

wheels stylized are at right angles to the line segment (5 and 5' respectively) 
showing the associated axle stylized and the segments (9, 10 and 9', 10' respectively) 

showing steerable wheels stylized are arranged obliquely to the line segment (6, 6') 
showing the associated axle stylized. 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the actuation member (1) 
is situated in the driver's field of vision and in the region of the steering wheel, on the 

dashboard, on a console or the like at a distance easy to reach manually from the 
driver's normal sitting position, and the said actuation member has associated therewith, 

adjacent thereto, a return switch (1B) by the respective actuation of which a 
switching or locking action released by actuating the actuation member (1A) can be set 

back by one respective step within the given sequence, and the image on the display (3) 
of the actuation member (1A) follows these changes by changing the symbols accordingly.  

 
A motor vehicle according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the symbols (11'', 12'', 
13'') are shown on the respective switch (11', 12', 13') by stickers, colour printing, 

translucent lines illuminated from the inside, or LED or LCD display segments activated 
accordingly.
