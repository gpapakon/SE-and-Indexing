<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention generally relates to ink-jet printer
technology, and is directed more particularly to an ink jet
printer according to the preamble of Claim 1, having an apparatus
for priming a thermal ink-jet printhead cartridge. An
ink jet printer of this type is known from US-A-4,543,591.Thermal ink jet printers commonly utilize ink jet
printhead cartridges which typically include one or more
ink reservoirs and an integrated circuit printhead that
includes a nozzle plate having an array of ink ejecting
nozzles which emit ink droplets in response to electrical
pulses provided to the printhead.An important consideration with printhead cartridges
is the need to ready a cartridge for printing. For example,
when a new cartridge is installed in a printer or
after a period of non-usage, the cartridge might be unable
to produce ink drops at one or more nozzles, for example as
a result of foreign contamination of the nozzles, dried ink
in the nozzles, or air injected into the nozzles.Known systems for priming include those which
involve the application of pressure to the ink supply in 
order to cause ink flow into the ink containing chambers
that are adjacent the ink ejecting nozzles. Considerations
with such known systems is need for access to the ink
reservoir, and the various mechanical impedances between
the ink reservoir and the nozzles which reduce the pressure
that eventually reaches the nozzles.It would therefore be an advantage to provide an ink
jet cartridge primer that provides priming negative pressure
directly to the nozzles of an ink jet cartridge.The foregoing and other advantages are provided by the
invention in an inkjet printer, comprising the features of claim 1.An embodiment of the printer according to the present invention
comprises a primer apparatus that includes an elongated
resilient bellows assembly compressible along its length
and having upper and lower end caps at its ends. The upper
cap includes an opening at which negative pressure (i.e.,
lower that ambient atmospheric pressure) is produced when
the upper and lower end caps are relatively displaced away
from each other. A capper having an opening is supported
by the first end cap of the bellows assembly for selective
engagement with the nozzle array of the cartridge being
primed or with a conduit structure that connected to the
nozzle plate of the cartridge being primed, so that the
negative pressure produced in the opening of the first end
cap is communicated to the nozzles of the nozzle array.

<CLAIMS>
An ink jet printer comprising:

a print carriage (151);
a printhead cartridge (157) supported by said print carriage,
said printhead cartridge having a nozzle array;
capping means (173) for sealingly surrounding the printhead
nozzle array pursuant to engagement of said capping

means with the printhead cartridge;
vacuum conveying means (161, 167, 171) for conveying priming
vacuum to said capping means (173); and
a manually actuated source of priming vacuum (50, 60, 61,
70, 77, 83), 
characterized
 in that

said manually actuated source of priming comprises a
vacuum conveying capper (119) spaced apart form said

vacuum conveying means for selectively engaging said
vacuum conveying means for application of vacuum thereto,

whereby positive pressure is not produced when said capping
means is brought into engagement with said printhead

cartridge.
The ink jet printer of Claim 1 wherein said
manually actuated source of priming vacuum comprises:


an elongated resilient bellows (50) compressible
along its length and having first and second end caps

(101, 103) at its ends, said first end cap having an
opening at which at which negative pressure is produced

when said first and second end caps are relatively
displaced away from each other;
said capper (119) being supported by said first end cap
of said bellows means for selective engagement with

said vacuum conveying means to form a seal therewith
so that the negative pressure produced in said opening

of said first end cap is communicated to the nozzles
of the nozzle array;
moving means (70) for moving said first end cap (101)
between a retracted position and an extended position 

along the length of said bellows (50), wherein
movement of the first end cap from the retracted

position to the extended position is away from the
second end cap;
rotatable priming controlling means (60) for (a)
moving the second end cap (103) toward the first end

cap while the first end cap is stationary, (b)
actuating said moving means (70) to move the first

end cap (101) to the extended position while the
second end cap (103) is stationary so as to pruduce

negative pressure at the opening of the said capper
while the first end cap is moving to the extended

position, (c) moving the second end cap away from the
first end cap while the first end cap is stationary

so as to produce an ink suctioning negative pressure
at the opening of said capper, (d) moving the first

end cap toward the second end cap while moving the
second end cap away from the first end cap at a rate

that is greater than the rate at which the first end
cap is moving toward the second end cap such that

negative pressure is produced at the opening of said
capper while the first end cap is moving to the

retracted position; and
manually actuated plunger means (61), for
actuating said priming controlling means (60);

   whereby negative pressure is produced at the
opening of said capper (119) at all times that said

first end cap (101) is in the extended position.

said moving means (70) includes moving
means cam surfaces (64), for controlling the

displacement of said first end cap;
said first end cap (101) includes first cam
follower means (131) slidably engaged on said moving

means cam surfaces (64); and
said priming conrolling means (60) includes
second cam surfaces (95) that control the

displacement of said second end cap (103), and third

said resilient bellows (50) includes a coil
spring (105) for providing an expanding bias tending

to displace the first end cap (101) away from the
second end cap;
said first end cap cam follower means comprises
second end cap cam follower pegs (131);
said moving means (70) comprises a slider (70)
having cam surface slidable along said cam follower

pegs;

follower pegs;
said third cam surfaces comprise cam edges (74a,
74b) formed in the perimeter of planar members (65)

for engaging said slider cam follower pegs;

   whereby rotation of said planar members (65)
