<ABSTRACT>
A lock nut (8) having a tapered portion (8b) at one end 
is screwed on an output shaft (2) that transfers 

motion to a steering mechanism. A tapered fitting hole (60) 
formed through the axis of a worm wheel (6) is fitted onto the 

outer circumference of the tapered portion with a slip plate (9) 
interposed therebetween. By tightening the lock nut (8), the 

worm wheel (6) is pressed and fixed to a support portion (25) formed 
on the output shaft, and a worm (7) connected 

to a steering assisting electric 
motor is made to engage with 

the worm wheel. In normal operation, the 
torque of the electric motor is transmitted to the worm 

wheel (6) and further on to the output shaft (2) via 
friction on the slip plate (9). Upon application of an excessive 

rotational torque in the event of a motor lock, slip-page 

occurs on the slip plate to allow free rotation of the 
output shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power 
steering apparatus that uses an electric motor as an auxiliary 
power source for steering, and more particularly to a 
power steering apparatus in which the torque of the electric 
motor is transmitted to a steering mechanism via a worm 
gear-type reduction mechanism. A power steering apparatus is provided to apply steering 
assisting power to the steering mechanism in accordance 
with the steering torque applied at the steering wheel, 
thereby reducing the effort required to steer the road 
wheels and thus achieving a comfortable steering feel. In 
recent years, power steering apparatus have come to be used 
widely not only in large vehicles such as buses and trucks 
but also in smaller vehicles such as standard-sized passenger 
cars, mini cars, etc. Power steering apparatus for this application are 
largely classified into two types according to the steering 
assisting power source used: the hydraulic type that uses a  
 
hydraulic actuator such as a hydraulic cylinder; and the 
electric type that uses an electric motor. The electric-type 
power steering apparatus is constructed to provide 
steering assisting power by driving a steering assisting 
electric motor installed midway through a steering mechanism 
in accordance with the result of the detection of the steering 
torque applied at the steering wheel, and by applying 
the torque of the motor to the steering mechanism. The use 
of this type of power steering apparatus has been increasing 
recently because of the advantage that the steering assisting 
power characteristics can be easily changed by controlling 
the energization of the electric motor according to 
driving conditions such as vehicle speed, steering frequency, 
etc. One problem with the electric power steering apparatus 
has been the difficulty in obtaining a compact electric 
motor capable of providing sufficient- torque for steering 
assisting power, coupled with the difficulty in securing 
space in a vehicle for installation of such a motor. This 
problem, however, has been solved by installing a reduction 
mechanism midway through a steering power transmission 
system coupling from the power assisting motor to the steering 
mechanism to reduce the motor speed thereby increasing 
the motor torque for transmission to the steering mechanism. 
The reduction mechanism is required to be constructed compact  
 
in size to reduce the overall size of the transmission 
system, while providing a high reduction ratio. To meet 
this
