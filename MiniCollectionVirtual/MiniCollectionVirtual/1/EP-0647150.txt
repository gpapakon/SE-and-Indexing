<ABSTRACT>
A method for dicrimination between ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia and an apparatus for performing the method. In response to the detection of the occurrence of a tachycardia, stimulus pulses are delivered to one or both of the SA and AV nodal fat pads. The response of the heart rhythm to these stimulus pulses is monitored. Depending upon the change or lack of change in the heart rhythm, a diagnosis is made as to the origin of the tachycardia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to implantable stimulators 
generally and more particularly to implantable cardioverters 
and defibrillators. Automatic tachycardia detection systems for previously 
disclosed automatic cardioverter/ defibrillators presently 
have relied upon the presence or absence of electrical and 
mechanical heart activity (such as intramyocardial pressure, 
blood pressure, impedance, stroke volume or heart movement) 
and/or the rate of the electrocardiogram to detect 
hemodynamically compromising ventricular tachycardia or 
fibrillation. Others have suggested the use of 
physiological sensors such as oxygen saturation sensors to 
diagnose various types of tachyarrhythmias. Very generally, the systems that depend upon the 
aforementioned criteria are capable of discriminating 
tachycardia in greater or lesser degree from normal heart 
rate but can have difficulty discriminating ventricular 
tachycardias from supraventricular tachycardias or in 
distinguishing sinus tachycardias from non-sinus 
tachycardias in some circumstances which may result in 
delivery of inappropriate antitachycardia therapies. Use of pacing stimuli to discriminate between types of 
tachyarrhythmias has also been proposed. In the article, "A 
Single Atrial Extrastimulus Can Distinguish Sinus 
Tachycardia from 1:1 Paroxysmal Tachycardia" by Jenkins et 
al, published in Pace, Vol. 9, Part II, Nov.-Dec., 1986, 
delivery of an atrial premature stimulus is disclosed as a 
method of distinguishing sinus tachycardia from ventricular 
tachycardia with one to one retrograde conduction or A-V 
nodal reentrant tachycardia.  
 
This article also discusses various methods of 
distinguishing among types of tachycardias based upon timing 
of spontaneous atrial and ventricular contractions. It is known that stimulation of the vagus nerves can 
vary the heart's rhythm. This phenomena has often been 
proposed as a method of treating tachyarrhythmias. It is 
also known that the nervous system regulating the rhythm of 
the heart includes a number of highly ganglionated plexi or 
"fat pads" at various locations on the heart, including fat 
pads associated with the SA and AV nodes. As set forth in 
"Functional Anatomy of the Cardiac Efferent Innervation", by 
Randall et al, in Neurocardiology, edited by Kulbertus et 
al, Futura Publishing Co., 1988, direct epicardial 
stimulation of the fat pad associated with the SA node can 
produce a slowing of the sinus rate and stimulation of the 
fat pad associated with the AV node can result in a 
prolo
