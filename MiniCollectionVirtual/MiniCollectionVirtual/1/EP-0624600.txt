<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for agglomerating small 
rubber particles in an aqueous latex to form 

large rubber particles. The process involves the 
addition of a water soluble organic acid and a 

water soluble organic anhydride to the latex 
prior to agglomeration of the rubber particles to 

facilitate agglomeration of the rubber particles 
into large rubber particles which are essentially 

free of coagulum. The latex of large rubber 
particles is useful in the preparation of ABS 

polyblends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process 
for agglomerating polymeric Particulates in an 
aqueous latex, and more particularly relates to 
use in combination an organic acid and an organic 
anhydride to facilitate agglomeration of rubber 
particles in an aqueous latex. Direct polymerization of diene monomers to 
large diameter rubber particles is typically a 
slow process via emulsion polymerization. Large 
rubber particles are desirable however in the 
production of ABS (acrylonitrile-butadienestyrene) 
resin to produce resin exhibiting 
enhanced levels of impact strength. Chemical 
agglomeration processes exist for the production 
of large rubber particles from small rubber 
particles. These chemical agglomeration 
processes have in the past involved the addition 
of water soluble organic acids or water soluble 
organic anhydrides to facilitate agglomeration of 
the rubber particles. It has been discovered 
however that acid agglomeration and anhydride 
agglomeration of small rubber particles in an 
aqueous latex into large rubber particles in an 
aqueous latex can result in the formation of 
substantial amounts of coagulum (for example > 
than 2% by weight) based on the total weight of 
rubber which is undesirable in the rubber phase  
 
of ABS resins because big masses of rubber 
(coagulum) can adversely affect the appearance 
and physical properties of the ABS resin or 
create production issues. A prior agglomeration 
process is set out in Dalton U.S. Patent 
3,558,541 issued January 26, 1971 and is 
incorporated herein by reference. Accordingly, it is desired to have an 
agglomeration process for agglomerating small 
rubber particles into large-size rubber particles 
without the formation of substantial amounts of 
coagulum. The present invention involves a process for 
agglomerating small rubber particles having a 
weight average particle size diameter of 0.05 to 
0.20 microns to large rubber particles preferably 
having a weight average particle size diameter of 
0.30 to 1.0 microns wherein the large rubber 
particle have a weight average diameter of at 
least 50 percent greater than the small rubber 
particles. The process may be either batch, 
semibatch or continuous and comprises adding a 
water soluble organic acid concurrently with a 
water soluble organic anhydride to a latex 
containing small rubber particles to facilitate 
agglomeration of the small particles into larae 
particles without the formation of substantial 
levels of coagulum. The process may be employed 
as a step in a
