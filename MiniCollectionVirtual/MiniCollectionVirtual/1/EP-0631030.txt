<ABSTRACT>
The folding doors 100 comprises of a first door panel 
150 and a second door panel 110, the first door panel 150 

being attached to the door opening portion of the wall 
rotatively by a pin 152. 
 
The second door panel 110 is attached to the first door 
panel 150 by a hinge 4. A guiding device 120 is mounted on 

the upper portion of the second door panel 110. The guiding 
device 120 holds a slider 122 and a rotary damper 200 for 

damping the rotation of the axis holding the slider. The 
slider 122 slides without rotating inside the guiding rail 12 

mounted on the upper portion of the door opening portion. 
The second door panel 110 rotates by opening/closing action, 

so by damping this relative rotation with the rotary damper 
200, the folding doors could be closed quietly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a folding door used, for 
example, as the door of a lavatory in an airplane. Folding doors do not use up space when opening and 
closing the door compared to normal board-type doors, so they 
are utilized in the lavatory of airplanes, telephone boxes, 
bath units of houses and the like. Fig. 14 is an explanatory view showing the folding doors 
used in lavatory units of airplanes. The folding doors shown as a whole by reference 1 
comprises of a first door panel 2 and a second door panel 3, 
and the first door panel 2 and the second door panel 3 is 
connected by a hinge 4. Fig. 15 is a cross sectional view showing the hinge 4. 
It takes a structure where hinge members 4A, 4B forming a 
gear portion are set on the end portion of panels 2, 3, and 
both hinge members are held by a cover member 4D. By the engagement of the gear portion of hinge members 
4A, 4B, the two pieces of door panels 2, 3 will fold 
smoothly, and the sealing ability will improve because hinge 
members are held by the cover 4D. A coil spring 5 is set in the hinge portion, and forces 
the door panels 2, 3 to be forming a plane surface (to be 
closed) basically. Fig. 16 shows the detail of the coil spring 5. The coil  
 
spring 5 positioned between the first door panel 2 and the 
second door panel 3 forces the folded panels 2, 3 in the 
direction to return to a position forming a plane surface. A door locking device 8 is set on the second door panel 
3. A pin 6 is planted on the end portion of the first door 
panel 2, and supports the whole folding doors 1 rotatably on 
the side of the wall of the lavatory unit. A guiding device 7 is set on the upper portion of the 
second door panel 3, and it enables the second door panel 3 
to open and close along the door opening portion of the 
lavatory unit. Fig. 17 shows the detail of the guiding device 7. The 
guiding device 7 set on the upper portion of the second door 
panel 3 includes a slider 7A and a shaft 7B which supports 
the slider 7A. The slider 7A, for example, has a 
quadrilateral plane form, and fits in the guide rail 9 formed 
on the door opening portion. When the second door panel 3 opens or closes, the slider 
7A guides the second door panel smoothly by sliding through 
the guide rail 9. When the plane form of the slider 7A is a quadrilateral, 
the slider 7A takes a straight line movement and the door 
panel 3 takes a gyrating movement, so the slider 7A rotates 
against the shaft 7B. In the folding doors having the above mentioned 
structure, the

<CLAIMS>
A folding door (100) comprising: 

a first door panel (150) rotatably supported in use at one side portion 
of the door opening portion; 
a second door panel (110) mounted foldably by a hinge (4) to the 
first door panel (150); and 
a guiding device (120) which guides the second door panel (110) along 
the door opening portion; 
 
wherein the guiding device comprises of; 


a guiding rail (12) fixed in use on the door opening portion; 
a slider (122) mounted on the second door panel (110) for rotation about an axis perpendicular to the top edge of the second door panel and being so as to slide without relative rotation 
inside the guiding rail (12); and 
a rotary damper (200) acting between said slider and said second door panel so as to oppose rotation about said 
rotation axis. 
A folding door claimed in Claim 1 further comprising, a 
forcing means (5) at the connecting portion of the first door 

panel (150) and the second door panel (110) for restoring the first door 
panel (150) and the second door panel (110) to a plane state. 
A folding door claimed in Claim 1 wherein the rotary 
damper (200) comprising: 


a case (205) and a damping chamber (220) formed inside the case (205); 
liquid (222) filled inside the damping chamber (220); 
a shaft (210) going through the damping chamber (220); 
a rotor (240) connected to the shaft (210) and slidably rotates inside 

the damping chamber (220); 
a check valve mounted on the rotor (240); and 
an orifice groove (230) formed in the side wall of the damping  
 

chamber (220). 
A folding door claimed in Claim 3 wherein, the orifice 
groove (230) formed in the damping chamber (220) of the rotary damper (200) is 

formed so that the damping power increases as the first door 
panel (150) and the second door panel (110) reverts to a plane state.
