<ABSTRACT>
A continuous method of bleaching an alkylpolyglycoside, substantially free of alcohol, with peroxy compounds, preferably hydrogen peroxide, which is highly efficient to provide an unexepcted high degree of color reduction from a dark brown to a light, white product, from an extinction coefficent color respectively of about 10 to about 15 to about 0.025 to about 0.15. The bleaching is carried out at controlled pH and temperature, under pressure preferably in the presence of Mg or MgO.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method for
bleaching alkylpolyglycosides, and in particular to a
continuous method of bleaching with a peroxide, such as
hydrogen peroxide.Alkyl glycosides are conveniently prepared by
reacting an alcohol of the type and chain length which is
desired to form the "alkyl" portion of the glycoside of
interest with a saccharide reactant (e.g., a
monosaccharide such as glucose, xylose, arabinose,
galactose, fructose, etc., or a polysaccharide such as
starch, hemicellulose, lactose, maltose, melibiose, etc.)
or with a glycoside starting material wherein the
aglycone portion thereof is different from the alkyl
substituent desired for the ultimate alkyl glycoside 
product of interest. Typically, such reaction is
conducted at an elevated temperature and in the presence
of an acid catalyst. Various alkyl glycoside products
and processes for making same are disclosed in a variety
of representative patents. U.S. Patent 4,987,225
contains an extensive listing of processes for preparing
alkyl glycoside compositions. As disclosed therein,
