<ABSTRACT>
In order to tune a radio receiver by means of station keys, a certain number of transmission frequencies is at first stored in a predetermined order under each station key. By actuating the station key during a predetermined minimum time, the actually set transmission frequency is written into the first memory field. By actuating again the same station key during the predetermined minimum time, the transmission frequency of the just set transmitter is written into the following memory field. This process is repeated until all memory fields of the station key are taken. The transmission frequencies stored under a station key are successively stored in the predetermined order by actuating several times said station key.

A method for tuning a radio receiver by means of station 
buttons to any one of a plurality of transmitter 

frequencies, which are stored in selective association 
with the station buttons, whereby under each station 

button at most a predetermined number of transmitter 
frequencies is stored in an associated memory area; 


a) by operating a station button during a period which 
is shorter than a predetermined time interval, 

switching from the present to the respectively 
following memory area occurs, and the radio receiver 

is tuned to the transmitter frequency stored 
therein, 
b) the transmitter frequencies stored under a station 
button are set by operating this station button 

several times in succession in a predetermined 
sequence, 
characterised in that
 
   c) under each station button the transmitter 

frequencies are stored in the predetermined sequence 
by, when actuating the station button at least 

during the predetermined time interval, the 
currently set transmitter frequency being written 

into the set memory area. 
A method according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 if the predetermined number of 
transmitter frequencies stored under one station button 

is exceeded, the currently set transmitter frequency is  
 

written into the last memory area in the predetermined 
sequence and the preceding memory areas are in each case 

overwritten with the transmitter frequency of the 
directly following memory area. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 a transmitter frequency already 
written in a determined memory area under a station 

button is firstly set by actuating the station button and 
then is written into the first memory area by the renewed 

operation of the station button during the predetermined 
minimum period, and the contents of said memory area are 

in turn written into that memory area whose contents are 
written into the first memory area. 
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 during the adjustment to a 
transmitter frequency, which is performed by actuating a 

station button, the reception quality is tested and if 
predetermined reception quality criteria are not met, 

switching over to the transmitter frequency written into 
the following memory area automatically occurs.
