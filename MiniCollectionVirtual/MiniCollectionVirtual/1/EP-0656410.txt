<ABSTRACT>
Pressure-sensitive "hot melt" adhesive compositions 
based on styrene-butadiene radial block copolymers, 

styrene-isoprene linear and/or radial block copolymers 
and plasticizing oils, are characterized in that they 

maintain low tack values (peeling, quick Stick) although 
having a good balance of properties normally 

required.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-adhesive
composition basically based on: a) a radial block
copolymer of butadiene with styrene, b) a linear or
radial, block copolymer of isoprene with styrene; c) at
least one adhesion-promoting resin as well as at least
one plasticizing oil and antioxidants.The mixture has excellent self-adhesive characteristics,
similar to those of a mixture obtained with
natural rubber partially cross-linked mixed with
adhesion-promoting resins. It can be used for the
production of adhesive tapes, labels, self-adhesive
items for sanitary use (for example sanitary towels).
It can be favourably compared to mixtures based on
natural rubber which however have lower technological
properties (for example cohesion), and are suitable for
sophisticated use which requires a good balance of
cohesive and adhesive properties; these properties are 
evaluated in accordance with the following tests:
Rolling ball tack (ASTM D3121)Probe tack (ASTM D2979/71)180Â° peel adhesion test; PSTC 1Quick Stick; PSTC 5Shear adhesion (Holding Power); modified PSTC 7Aging stability.Among patent documentation in the known art which
describes adhesive compositions based on ABA linear
block copolymers, the following can be quoted: patent
application WO 91/02039 and patents US 3.239.478; US
3.784.587; US 3.427.269. Among patent documentation in
the known art which describes adhesive compositions
based on radial block copolymers of the type (AB)nBA, US
4.096.203 and IT93/A00879 can be quoted.Hot-melt adhesive compositions based on styrene
block copolymers are also particularly used when
adhesion with not very (or totally non) polar substrates
is required, such as polyethylene and the like
and in applications where the product is subjected to
mechanical and/or elastic stress. This is the case with
adhesives for nappies and sanitary towels.Adhesive formulations based on a styrene-butadiene
block copolymer very often have technological problems
deriving from their limited tack, whereas on the other 
hand adhesive formulations based on styrene-isoprene
block copolymers have excessive tack, which creates
great difficulty in unrolling the adhesive tape.High tack also causes annoying and excessive noise
during the high-speed industrial operation of spool
cutting. High noise values when operating in the
unrolling phase for spool cutting are associated to
high tack values, such as peeling and quick stick.It has now been found, and the present invention
is related thereto, that a polymeric composition based
on a
