<ABSTRACT>
A hair-treatment gel containing (A) 0.3 to 4 wt% of at least one high-molecular acrylic acid homopolymer with a molecular weight of 1,000,000 to 4,000,000 and/or a methyl vinyl ether maleic acid anhydride copolymer cross-linked with decadiene, (B) 10 to 50 wt%. of at least one non-ionic and/or anionic tenside and (D) 10 to 40 wt% ethanol and/or isopropanol. The hair treatment agent, when used as a permanent wave pretreatment agent, gives the hair a loose, springy and uniform permanent wave and excellent wet and dry combability, especially at the tips. In addition, the agent has good glossing properties.

<CLAIMS>
Permanent waving pretreatment agent in 
gel form, characterised in that it contains: 


(A) in addition to component (B) as the sole 
further polymer from 0.3 to 4 weight 

percent of at least one high-molecular 
acrylic acid homopolymer with a molecular 

weight of from 1,000,000 to 4,000,000; 
(B) 15 to 30 weight percent of at least one 
non-volatile polydimethylsiloxane; 
(C) from 0.1 to 0.5 weight percent of at 
least one non-tonic and/or anionic 

surfactant; and 
(D) from 10 to 40 weight percent of ethanol 
and/or isopropanol. 
Agent according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that it contains from 0.4 to 2 weight percent 

of component (A). 
Agent according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that it contains from 25 to 35 weight percent 

of component (D).  
 
Process for permanently shaping hair in 

which the hair, in particular the tips of the 
hair, before being wound onto permanent waving 

rollers is treated with a permanent waving 
pretreatment agent, is wound onto rollers, is then 

treated with a permanent hair shaping agent, is 
washed with water after a reaction time sufficient 

for the permanent shaping of the hair, is then 
post-treated oxidatively, rinsed with water, 

subsequently set in a hairstyle and then dried, 
characterised in that an agent according to any 

one of Claims 1 to 3 is used as the permanent 
waving pretreatment agent. 
Process according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the permanent waving 

pretreatment agent is used in an amount of from 3 
to 6 g.
