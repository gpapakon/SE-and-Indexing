<DESCRIPTION>
Angiogenesis (or neovascularization), the 
development of blood vessels, plays an important role in 
embryonic development, in the inflammatory response, in the 
development of metastases (tumor induced angiogenesis or 
TIA), in diabetic retinopathy, in the formation of the 
arthritic panus and in psoriasis. In tumor angiogenesis, 
for example, capillary sprouts are formed, their formation 
being induced by a group of tumor cells. These sprouts 
eventually develop into a microcirculatory network within 
the tumor mass. There are two principle types of tumor 
angiogenesis in terms of the events which follow 
implantations of metastatic seedlings on surfaces and in 
organs. The first or primary angiogenesis is the initial 
vascularization of the mass of multiplying tumor cells and 
is regarded as an essential prerequisite for the survival 
and further growth of a metastatic deposit. The second is a continuing or secondary 
angiogenesis and is the phenomenon which occurs in waves at 
the periphery of a growing tumor mass. This second 
angiogenesis is essential for the accretion of new 
microcirculatory territories into the service of the 
expanding and infiltrating tumor. It is apparent that a chemical which would 
inhibit angiogenesis, either by competitively inhibiting an 
angiogenesis factor or by some other mechanism, would have 
an adverse effect upon the growth of tumors, on the 
development of retinopathy or rheumatoid arthritis, or on 
the development of the psoriatic lesion. This invention provides the use 
of a compound of formula I  
 
wherein R1 and R3 are independently hydrogen, 
-CH3, 
 
wherein Ar is optionally 
substituted phenyl; R2 is selected from the group consisting of 
pyrrolidino and piperidino; and pharmaceutically acceptable 
salts and solvates thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for inhibiting angiogenesis 
and/or angiogenic disease, with the proviso that the disease does not include mammary and prostatic 
tumors, or rheumatoid arthritis. The current invention concerns the discovery 
that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes 
(benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for 
inhibiting angiogenesis and/or angiogenic diseases. The use 
provided by this invention is 
practiced by administering to a human in need of a dose of 
a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable 
salt or solvate thereof, that is effective to inhibit 
angiogenesis and/or angiogenic diseases. The term inhibit 
is defined to include its generally accepted meaning which
