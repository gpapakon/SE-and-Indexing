comprising a fixed flange (24) connected to the arm (10) 

for supporting the reel (12), 
at least a first and a second braking shoe (26,28) supported

face (30,32) which defines a 
braking surface for a corresponding internal annular braking band of 

said reel-holder flange. According to the invention means are provided 
for driving the braking action which comprise at least a first and a 

second thrust device (36,38) provided between said first 
and second braking 

shoe (26,28) at the facing and opposite ends of said

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a braking assembly for a reel-holder
flange in textile apparatus.Devices for braking a reel-holder flange in rotating motion in textile
apparatus have already been provided in the art. They comprise
essentially a fixed flange connected to the arm supporting the reel, a
first and a second braking shoe in the form of arched shells, coplanar
and facing one in respect of the other, with external arched lateral faces
which define a braking surface, and which are attached to said fixed
flange, and means for driving the movement of said first and second
braking shoe towards and against an annular band of said reel-holder
flange arranged inside said braking shoes, to engage it with friction and
to brake rotation of said reel-holder flange. Suitable elastic means are
also provided to return, acting in opposition to said means for driving
the braking action, said first and second shoe into a rest position of
non-braking.Braking devices for reel-holder flanges currently in use generally adopt 
braking shoes, of the type referred above, which are both restrained to
said fixed flange at one of their facing or matching ends by means of a
pin which allows outward rotation, driven by a suitable thrust device
acting to move the shoes apart on the side opposite that of hinging.Such a type of drive of the braking shoes is disadvantageous in that it
brings into contact with the annular surface used for the braking action
of said reel-holder flange only restricted portions of the external
braking face of each shoe. This leads to low efficiency braking which
rapidly consumes the shoes at the points in contact with the annular
band of braking of the mobile flange.Moreover said known braking devices, due to the fact that they have to
attach said braking shoes one to the other and to said fixed flange and
due to the fact that they often make use, to move the shoes apart, of
mechanical thrust means which have a certain structural complexity,
are awkward to set up and involve an excessive use of time for their
assembly. Moreover in the field of textile apparatus, the need has been
felt to provide braking assemblies for reel-holder flanges which are
simple, inexpensive, compact and which can be actuated by means of a
pressurised fluid. More particularly they have a thin section in order not
to create excessive volume between the reel-holder flange and the
support arm.The object of the present invention is therefore that of providing a 
braking assembly for a reel-holder flange in textile apparatus
