<ABSTRACT>
An organophilic clay thickener for natural oil systems 
comprising the reaction product of a smectite-type clay and an 

organic cation in an amount of from about 75% to about 150% of the 

cation exchange capacity of the smectite-type clay. Said

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organophilic clay thickeners which 
are dispersible in non-aqueous fluids to thicken such fluids by forming a gel 
therein or otherwise modifying the viscosity of such fluids. The invention 
also pertains to a process for preparing these organophilic clay gellants, and 
to non-aqueous fluid compositions including the same. It is well known that organic compounds containing a cation will 
react with a clay under favorable conditions by ion exchange to form an 
organophilic clay. Such clay modification results in a product which unlike 
clay is dispersible in non-aqueous fluids to change fluids characteristics such 
as viscosity. It is also known in the art that such organophilic clays can be 
used to modify the viscosity (thicken) of a variety of organic compositions 
including inks, greases, drilling fluids, paints and other similar products. 
See for example, U.S. Patent No. 2,966,506 and the book Clay Mineralogy, 2nd 
Ed., 1968, R.E. Grim (McGraw Hill Book Company). It is also well known that such complexes may function to thicken 
polar or non-polar petroleum based solvents, depending on the substituents on 
the organic salt. J.W. Jordan, in "Proceedings of the 10th National Conference 
on Clays and Clay Minerals" (1963), discusses a wide range of applications of 
organophilic clays.  In some situations the efficiency of organophilic clays can be further 
improved by adding a low molecular weight polar organic material to the 
composition. Such polar organic materials have been called dispersants, 
dispersion aids, solvating agents and the like. The most efficient polar 
materials for use as such have been found to be low molecular weight alcohol 
and ketones, particularly methanol and acetone. See for example U.S. Patent 
Nos. 2,677,661, 2,704,276, 2,833,720, 2,879,229 and 3,294,683. The use of such 
dispersion aids has in other situations been found to be unnecessary when using 
specially designed organoclays. See U.S. Patent Nos. 4,105,578 and 4,208,218. Furthermore, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,977,897, 4,382,868 and 4,464,274 describe 
the preparation of preactivated organophilic clay gellants, used to thicken 
organic compositions wherein the activators are admixed with the organophilic 
clays. More recently, organophilic clay gellants have been developed which are the 
reaction products of smectite-type clays with organic cations and organic anion 
combinations. These gellants have the advantage of being effectively 
dispersible in particular organic compositions. An
