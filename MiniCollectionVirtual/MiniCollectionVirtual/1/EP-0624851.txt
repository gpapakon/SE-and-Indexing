<ABSTRACT>
In this paper it is described a hardware named RICH COUPLER which 
works between a card and its terminal-system. The function of a RICH 

COUPLER depends on its position which is shown by DRAWING. It is 
obvious between CARD LEVEL and SYSTEM LEVEL there is a third 

independent level, the COUPLER LEVEL. The CARD LEVEL and the 
SYSTEM LEVEL are involved in the specific card application. The 

COUPLER LEVEL is application independent. The goal of this patent is 
to describe a application independent RICH COUPLER which works like 

a supervisor between the applications on the CARD LEVEL and the 
applications on the SYSTEM LEVEL.

<DESCRIPTION>
This description of RICH relates to Integrated circuit(s) cards (IC-cards) 
and card terminals. IC-cards, terminals and communication standards 
between cards and terminals are described in the ISO 7816 for cards 
with contacts, in the ISO 10 536 for contactless cards and in the EN 726 
for cards and terminals for telecommunication use. It is possible to load into the memory of a IC-card data's for many different 
card applications (CA1, CA2, CA3 .. see RICH DRAWING 1,2) of 
different application providers (AP1, AP2, AP3..) like banks, dealer organisations, 
clubs, telephone companies, insurance companies, special 
service providers etc. Such cards are named multiapplication cards 
(MACs). It is obvious that a MAC would open the chance to combine the benefits 
of many different application providers at one card. The combination of 
two application providers on a usual magnetic stripe card is usually 
named co-branding. There are many different co-branding cards in the 
today's market and in the pockets of the card holders. The possibilities of a MAC exceeds the limits of a co-branding card extremely. 
That means there are uncountable possibilities of combining 
benefits of different application providers on one MAC. Because of this 
effect there would be established MAC-provider-pools. For example a 
phone company would combine its phone service opened by a IC-card 
with the benefits of a bank and opens the memory of the same card for a 
insurance company. A credit card organisation could combine its card 
with the benefits of a travel agency and add the benefits of a club to the 
card and further installs in the not complete filled memory the benefits of 
a retail and department store. For MAC-provider-pools the rule seems 
advantageous to start quick with market penetration and to save a great 
market share by issuing many cards in a short time to a great number of 
consumers. Because this rule is valid for all the different MAC-provider-pools 
it could be assumed that there spread out different MACs into the 
market.  For the card user this situation bears two troubles. If he decides for one 
card he has to do without the benefit of the other MAC. If he decides for 
the benefits of more than one card he has the troubles coming up by 
using many cards: he has different cards with different application and 
service benefits in his pockets. That means the advantages to hold only 
one MAC which serves for all the different benefits of cards is not 
reached. A customer which has to decide between many
