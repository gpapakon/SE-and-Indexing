<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements in platinum recovery, more especially
in the recovery of platinum used as a catalyst in ammonia oxidation.The process of oxidation of ammonia in nitric acid plants, by passing the
mixture of gases over a catalyst gauze, which is usually an alloy of platinum and 5-10%
rhodium, is well established. It is also well known that platinum is lost from the catalyst
during the process and may be recovered in part by a so-called catchment gauze based on
palladium. The basis ofthe catchment process is described in US Patent 3,434,820 and
"Platinum Metals Review" 13 [No 1] pages 2-8 (1969). The catchment gauze used in practice 
was originally a palladium-gold alloy, although the trend in the art appears to be towards
the use of palladium itself. Palladium alloys with base metals, have been proposed and
used to a greater or lesser extent. Base metals and other alloying elements which have been
recommended in particular (see EP 0,077,121) are gold, of course; platinum; nickel;
copper; ruthenium and silver. Cobalt has been mentioned as a potential component of
catalyst gauzes (see our GB 1,404,576) and a possible component for recovery gauzes (see
USP 5,122,185) but it does not appear that this material has in fact previously been used
and its unique property in emission control has not been realised and used in a practical
application.The catchment gauzes in general use are woven from fine wires, although it
is possible also to use agglomerated fibre or ribbon (see GB 2,141,042, GB 2,096,484 for
example), and the latest developments are in knitted fabrics (see EP 0,364,153) to form
gauzes.There remains a need, despite over 20 years development of the gauzes and the
catchment materials, for a catchment material that offers at least some of ease of
manufacture, good recovery performance and other advantages over current materials. We
have also realised that during the start-up period of an ammonia oxidation campaign, the
incomplete catalytic processes tend to give higher production of N2O than during later
stages ofthe campaign. It is an aim ofthe present invention to reduce the potential for
emission of N2O particularly during start-up but potentially also throughout the campaign. The present invention provides a method of attenuating N2O emissions during
start-up of an ammonia oxidation reaction utilising a platinum based catalyst gauze and
incorporating a platinum recorevy gauze comprising fibres of a palladium alloy, characterised in that said palladium alloy contains 0.1
