<ABSTRACT>
A circumferential section (4) of the crankshaft (2) forms the inner track for the bearing bodies of a rolling bearing (6) having an outer bearing ring (7). This bearing ring is made from metallurgical powder, such as pulverised steel with a carbon content of 0.4 to 0.9% and on the one side has a wear-resistant hardened track (8) and on the other side is ductile on the outer circumference. The bearing ring is divided into two parts by breaking after sintering and has relatively marked structured break surfaces (10,10'). The bearing ring can be held with friction or force-locking engagement in a socket bore (9) of the machine housing.

<CLAIMS>
A bearing for a shaft in an engine block, especially a crankshaft in the drive
unit block of an internal combustion engine,


wherein a peripheral portion (4) of the shaft (2) serves as an inner
race for cylindrical, especially needle-shaped, rolling bearings (5) in a

rolling-bearing arrangement (6) comprising an outer ring bearing (7)
having a hardened microfinished race (8) and
designed in two parts by fracture parting corresponding to a divided
shaft bearing (1),

   characterised in that

the ring bearing (7) made by powder metallurgy from powder-alloy
steel, on the one hand has a race (8) made wear-resistant and load-bearing

by hardening whereas on the other hand the ring bearing (7),
which is sinter-forged before fracture parting, is made ductile at its

outer periphery to an extent such that
the ring bearing (7), which has relatively strongly structured fracture
parting surfaces (10, 10'), is held by adhesion and friction in a

receiving bore (9) in the engine block (3) since its outer diameter is
made greater than the diameter of the receiving bore (9).
A bearing according to claim 1, characterised in that the powder-alloy steel

has a carbon content of 0.4 to 0.9%.
