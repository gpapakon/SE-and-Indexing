<ABSTRACT>
A two cycle, preferably diesel, engine (11) has a 
turbocharger (19) with an exhaust driven turbine (20) and 

supplemental mechanical drive (24) maintaining a fixed 
minimum turbine/engine speed ratio with fuel efficient 

freewheeling (fully exhaust sustained) turbine 
operation at higher speeds and loads. A turbo boost 

apparatus provides freewheeling turbine operation at 
intermediate speeds where it might or will not 

otherwise occur. When an intermediate speed is 
reached at which freewheeling can be sustained but is 

not occurring, the apparatus 1) temporarily increases 
engine speed to a predetermined higher level to 

accelerate the turbine and increase engine air flow; 
2) increases engine fuel input to a higher level 

capable of sustaining freewheeling; and 3) reduces 
engine speed to the selected intermediate speed while 

maintaining a fuel input level adequate to maintain 
turbine freewheeling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for operating a two cycle engine having a 
turbocharger. It is known in the art relating to two cycle 
diesel engines for use in locomotives and other 
applications to provide a turbosupercharger 
(turbocharger) having a rotor including both 
compressor and turbine wheels and connected with the 
engine crankshaft by a gear train for driving the 
turbine, that is, the turbocharger rotor, at a fixed 
minimum speed ratio relative to the engine 
(crankshaft) rotational speed. It should be 
understood that reference to an operating condition of 
the turbine, as is common among those skilled in the 
art, also applies where appropriate to the complete 
rotor including both turbine and compressor wheels. The gear train includes an overrunning 
clutch that allows the turbine to freewheel, that is, 
overrun the mechanical drive and be driven solely by exhaust gas energy, at speeds higher than those of the 
fixed ratio. This provides for supercharging of the 
engine cylinders at higher engine speeds and loads 
where the energy in the exhaust gas is adequate for 
exhaust sustained turbocharger operation. In one line of well known current production 
two cycle diesel engines used for railway, marine, 
power plant and industrial applications, a gear and 
exhaust driven turbocharger similar to those of US 
patent nos. 3,667,214 and 4,719,818 is provided for 
supplying scavenging and charging air to the engine 
air box for delivery through ports to the engine 
cylinders. As used in railway road locomotive (as 
opposed to switcher) applications it is common to 
provide a throttle control having eight engine speed  
 
settings from idle to full speed. A load control 
system controls the load applied to the engine by an 
engine driven generator to normally provide 
predetermined engine power settings for each power 
throttle speed setting from 1 to 8. The power 
settings are preselected to match the engine output 
with a desired power curve within scavenging and 
charging air pressure levels provided by the 
turbocharger. In general, these increase with the 
engine and turbocharger speed, but the charging 
pressure or pressure ratio increases significantly 
when the exhaust gas energy becomes sufficient to 
drive the turbine above the mechanically driven speed. 
Above this point, the air flow and pressure available 
are controlled by the combustion fuel energy which is 
limited by the full rack injector fuel injection 
capacity and the ability of the charging air supplied
