<ABSTRACT>
A device to mix and extrude various ingredients including 
pastas, pastries, baked goods, hors d'oeuvres, and cookies. The 

device includes novel measuring, mixing and extrusion arrangements 
including: an automatic measuring cup (40); a way to continuously mix 

(104,116) 
and extrude (30,38,108,110) ingredients without intervening cleanings; 

a mixing 
and extrusion feed (120,122) for handling different consistencies of 

ingredients; an integrated automatic cutter (46); motor cooling and 
extruded ingredient drying (48,57,64,66); as well as various safety 

devices (123,212).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a kitchen device to mix and extrude food products such
as pasta, cookies or hors d'oeuvres according to the first part of the main claim.Automatic home food mixing and extrusion appliances have been in common use
for many years. Automatic pasta making appliances which both mix dough and
automatically extrude dough through a die have been patented and in use in the
U.S. at least since the late 1970s. In general such appliance have a configuration
which includes a bin containing rotating blades, feeding an extrusion screw which
forces the mixed materials through an extrusion die.For the most part, existing pasta makers are limited in capacity, are messy and time
consuming to use, and have little versatility.From the EP-A-0 050 409 a kitchen device according to the preamble of the main
claim is known.Starting from a kitchen device known from the EP-A-0 050 409 the object of the
invention is to make the known kitchen device more effective.This object is solved by a kitchen device according to claim 1. According to the invention
in such a kitchen device the portion of the extruder chamber cylindrical perimeter
wall which is disposed within the mixing chamber is penetrated by an upper
extruder feed hole and a lower opening through which food product egresses from
said extruder chamber when said extruder screw is rotating in said predetermined
direction. During mixing, the extruder screw moves materials to the rear of the extruder
housing where they are cleared out of the extruder housing mostly through
the lower clearing hole according to this invention. This helps prevent the collection 
of dry flour in the extruder housing during mixing. Contrary to what logically might
be expected, the lower clearing hole does not substantially reduce efficiency of the
extruder feed mechanism because ingredients falling next to the extruder screw are
forced forward by the screw threads. Advantages of the present inventions will become apparent
from the following description and illustrations of a preferred
embodiment.Figure 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment constructed
according to the present inventions.Figure 1A is a detail of Figure 1 showing the control switch.Figure 2 is a top perspective view of mixing and extruding
components.Figure 3 is a longitudinal vertical section through the
center of the embodiment taken along line 3-3 of Figure 4.Figure 3A is a detail of Figure 3 showing sections of the
extruder chamber, extruder screw, die nut, and extrusion die.Figure 4 is a front
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A kitchen device to mix and extrude food products such as pasta, cookies or
hors d'oeuvres, said device comprising a mixing chamber (22),

an enclosure (28),
a motor (24),

said enclosure (28) housing said motor (24), said mixing chamber having
at least one opening to accept food product, said mixing chamber having

within it at least one mechanical mixing element (102, 104, 106, 108,110) operative
for mixing food product, an extruder chamber, said extruder chamber

including a cylindrical perimeter wall (32), the axis of said cylindrical perimeter
wall (32) being generally horizontal, a rotary helical extruder screw (30), said

rotary helical extruder screw (30) having an axis of rotation generally coaxial
with said axis of said cylindrical perimeter wall, said extruder chamber housing

said rotary helical extruder screw (30), linking between said mixing chamber
and said extruder chamber to permit transfer food product from said mixing

chamber to said extruder chamber, said extruder chamber mounting an extrusion
die (38), said extrusion die (38) being operative to form food product conveyed

by said extruder screw (30), said motor (24) being included in a drive
mechanism, said drive mechanism being reversible, said extruder screw (30)

coupled to said reversible drive mechanism and rotating in a predetermined
direction and a direction opposite said predetermined direction,
characterized in that

the portion of said extruder chamber cylindrical perimeter wall (32) which is
disposed within the mixing chamber (22) is penetrated by an upper extruder

feed hole (58) and a lower opening (160) through which food product 
egresses from said extruder chamber when said extruder screw (30) is rotating

in said predetermined direction.
The device of claim 1 characterized in that said opening (160) in said extruder
chamber cylindrical perimeter wall (32) being in communication with said mixing

chamber (22).
The device of claim 1 or 2 characterized by a bearing wall, said bearing wall
disposed on said extruder
 chamber opposite said extrusion die, said bearing
wall (150) penetrated by an orifice, and said orifice conveying a drive shaft
