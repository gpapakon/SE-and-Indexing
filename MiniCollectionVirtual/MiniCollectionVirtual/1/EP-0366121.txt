<ABSTRACT>
A recording liquid comprises a recording agent 
which is a component that forms a recorded image and a 

liquid medium in which said recording agent is dissolved 
or dispersed, wherein said recording agent comprises a 

dye (A) C.I. Reactive Red 23 and a dye (B) represented 
by R₁C₆H₃(SO₃M)
n
-N=N-C₁₀H₃(OH)(NHR₂)(SO₃M)₂, wherein R₁ 
represents H, halogen atom, carboxyl or alkyl; R₂ 

represents -COCH₃, -SO₂C₆H₄CH₃ or -COC₆H₄R₃, where R₃ 
represents H or Cl; M represents a base; and n represents 

either 0 or 1. An ink-jet recording method comprises 
applying a droplet of the recording liquid to a 

recording medium to carry out recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording 
liquid, a method for producing said liquid and an ink-jet recording 
method making use of said liquid. 
More particularly, it relates to such a 
recording liquid which is capable of giving a recorded image 
with a superior tone sharpness, light-resistance and 
gas resistance (see below). Hitherto having been used as inks in writing 
utensils such as fountain pens and felt pens are 
recording liquid comprising various types of dye 
dissolved in water or other organic solvent. Inks comprising various types of dye dissolved 
in water or other organic solvent are also used in ink-jet 
systems in which recording is performed by 
ejecting ink from an ejection orifice provided in a 
recording head, by the action of the oscillation 
attributable to a piezoelectric oscillator or the 
electrostatic force attributable to the application of 
a high voltage. The inks for ink-jet systems,  
 
however, are required to satisfy more severe 
conditions with respect to many performances than 
those required in the writing utensils such as 
fountain pens and felt pens commonly used. The ink-jet systems make a less noise and can 
afford to perform high-speed recording or color 
recording on a plain paper without taking any 
particular fixing step, and researches have been 
energetically made on various types. Various methods are available for the systems 
of this type, but all of them are required to have the 
performances such that the physical properties such as 
viscosity and surface tension are within the range of 
suitability, the recording agent has a dissolution 
capability high enough not to cause clogging of the 
minute ejection orifice, a recorded image can be 
obtained in a sufficiently high density, and changes 
in the values of physical properties, precipitation of 
solid contents, or the like may not occur during 
storage. In addition to the above performances, they 
are also required to have the properties that the 
recording can be performed without limitation on the 
type of recording members, they can achieve a high 
fixing speed, and they can give a recorded image with 
excellent water resistance, solvent resistance  
 
(resistance to alcohol, in particular), light-resistance, 
wear resistance, and resolution. Among these, particularly in relation to 
magenta color recording, recorded images tend to 
undergo color fading by light irradiation, in other 
words, have a poor light-resistance, causing a great 
problem. Thus, inks improved to eliminate these 
disadva
