<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 3-aroylbenzothiophenes,
compositions containing those
compounds and their use in preventing bone loss, treating
hypercholesterolemia and treating hormone dependent
mammalian breast and uterine carcinoma.The mechanism of bone loss is not well
understood, but in practical effect, the disorder arises
from an imbalance in the formation of new healthy bone and
the resorption of old bone, skewed toward a net loss of
bone tissue. This bone loss includes a decrease in both
mineral content and protein matrix components of the bone,
and leads to an increased fracture rate of, predominantly,
femoral bones and bones in the forearm and vertebrae.
These fractures, in turn, lead to an increase in general
morbidity, a marked loss of stature and mobility, and, in
many cases, an increase in mortality resulting from
complications.Bone loss occurs in a wide range of subjects,
including post-menopausal women, patients who have
undergone hysterectomy, patients who are undergoing or have
undergone long-term administration of corticosteroids,
patients suffering from Cushing's syndrome, and patients
having gonadal dysgensis.Unchecked, bone loss can lead to osteoporosis, a
major debilitating disease whose prominent feature is the
loss of bone mass (decreased density and enlargement of
bone spaces) without a reduction in bone volume, producing
porosity and fragility.One of the most common types of osteoporosis is
found in post-menopausal women affecting an estimated 20 to 
25 million women in the United States alone. A significant
feature of post-menopausal osteoporosis is the large and
rapid loss of bone mass due to the cessation of estrogen
production by the ovaries. Indeed, data clearly support
the ability of estrogens to limit the progression of
osteoporotic bone loss, and estrogen replacement is a
recognized treatment for post-menopausal osteoporosis in
the United States and many other countries.All mammalian cells require cholesterol as a
structural component of their cell membranes and for non-sterol
end products. Cholesterol is also required for
steroid hormone synthesis. The very property, however,
that makes cholesterol useful in the cell membranes, its
insolubility in water, also makes it potentially lethal.
When cholesterol accumulates in the wrong place, for
example within the wall of an artery, it cannot be readily
mobilized and its presence leads to the development of an
atherosclerotic plaque. Elevated concentrations of serum
cholesterol associated with low density lipoproteins
