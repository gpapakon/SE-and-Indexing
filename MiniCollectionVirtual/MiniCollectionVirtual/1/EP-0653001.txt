<ABSTRACT>
A cutting-edge member (A, B, C) for scraper blades having means (19, 23) for interlocking engagement with adjacent like cutting-edge members (A, B, C), each cutting-edge member (A, B, C) being adjustable and reversible in position relative to said adjacent like cutting-edge members (A, B, C), said means for interlocking comprising non-tapered angled dovetailed members (21, 23, 224) spaced along each side (17, 18, 20, 21) of each cutting-edge member and being separated by recesses (19, 25, 219), each dovetailed member (21, 23, 224) being of a size and shape the same as each of said recesses (19, 25, 219).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in blades
for earth moving machines such as scrapers, graders, bulldozers
and so on (hereinafter referred to as "scrapers")
and it refers particularly to the cutting edges - the
operative cutting edge portions of the blades.The ground-engaging tools of bulldozers, scrapers,
graders and other earth moving machines are made in a
wide variety ot types, according to the purposes for which
the tools are to be used. In general, there are replaceable
edge members capable of being bolted in position on a
support assembly, such as a scraper moldboard, and those
edge members may be made to suit a level cut arrangement
(with the front edges of the several members all in line),
in a drop centre or stinger arrangement (when the middle
part projects forwardly of the two or more side parts),
with integral forwardly-projecting teeth, with replaceable
forwardly projecting teeth, substantially planar in shape,
or, if necessary, curved, with front and rear edges so that
they may be reversed, and so on. The edge members for a
machine may be made in one piece to extend the full width
of the tools to which they are to be attached or they may
be made in shorter sections so that three, four or more
members are bolted in position on a support member to make
up the full width of the earth-engaging tool.In my earlier U.S.A. Patent 4,457,380 there is
described and defined a blade for scrapers. However, that
blade has been found to have certain limitations. If it is
desired to remove a female blade to either rotate it or
replace due to wear, or for any other reason, both that
blade and the adjacent two male blades, must be removed.
Also, it is difficult to rotate just the one female blade
due to every second blade being different. This invention is applicable to all such edge
members but for simplicity of description they will be
referred to as cutting edges or edge members for scraper
blades without limiting the invention to the blades of such
machines.This invention has been devised particularly with
the object of providing a construction of cutting edge for
a scraper blade such that the range of use of the cutting
edge will be greatly increased. Another object is to provide
cutting edges so cosntructed that they may be individually
reversed in position, interchanged, and/or used in
the straight or level-cut operational position, interchanged,
and/or used in the straight or level-cut operational
position or in the so-called "drop" or "stinger" position,
as required. A further object is to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A pair of cutting-edge members for scraper blades, each
cutting-edge member (11) having means for interlocking engagement

with adjacent like cutting-edge members, each cutting-edge member
being reversible in position by removing the cutting-edge and

pivoting about the horizontal transverse axis of said cutting-edge
member, wherein the means for interlocking engagement comprise

dovetailed members (23, 24) spaced along each side of said cutting-edge
member (11) and being separated by recesses (19, 25), each

dovetailed member having respective undercut parallel angled side
walls, each dovetailed member (23, 24) being of a size and shape to

be complementary with said recesses (19, 25). 
A pair of cutting-edge members as claimed in claim 1,
wherein each dovetailed member has parallel side walls

which are undercut and are also inclined to the vertical.
A pair of cutting-edge members as claimed in claim 1,
wherein there is provided at least two fastening holes by

which said cutting-edge member may be fastened to said
scraper blade.
A pair of cutting-edge members as claimed in claim 2,
wherein said dovetailed members have a spacing related to

the location and spacing of said fastening holes.
A pair of cutting-edge members for scrape blades, as claimed in claim 1, wherein each end thereof has an
edge (14, 15), said edges (14, 15) being substantially parallel.
A pair of cutting-edge members as claimed in any one of
claims 1 to 4, wherein said dovetailed members along one

side of cutting-edge members are transversely aligned with
said recesses along the other side of said cutting-edge

member.
