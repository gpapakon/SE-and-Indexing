<ABSTRACT>
A fluid-pressure operated clutch includes plungers (21) 
provided on a drive member (10) for engaging with sockets 

(25) provided in a driven member (20), the plungers being 
operated by supplying pressure fluid to a pressure chamber 

(32). When a predetermined torque limit is reached or 
exceeded, cooperating cam surfaces on the plunger and 

sockets cause the plunger to be displaced, opening an 
exhaust valve (40) for the pressure fluid, and disengaging 

the clutch.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fluid-pressure operated 
clutch device of the kind incorporating torque limited means. The torque limiting means of clutch devices of this kind 
typically comprise a torque sensor which disables a solenoid 
valve when a predetermined upper torque limit is sensed. Thus 
there is known from WO/91/15684 a clutch device incorporating 
a torque sensor the output of which can be employed to 
disengage the clutch to prevent overload damage by causing a 
solenoid valve to cut off the fluid pressure supply to the 
clutch device. The invention is concerned with the provision of a 
clutch device of the kind described in which the torque 
limiting means are incorporated in the device instead of 
depending on remotely located components. The invention accordingly provides a clutch device of 
the kind described in which mechanical sensing of an upper 
torque limit effects relief of fluid pressure in the clutch 
device. The mechanical sensing of the torque limit can be 
effected by inter-engaging elements arranged for relative 
movement when the limit is reached, for example, a plunger 
fully received in a socket during normal operation but 
displaceable therefrom when the torque limit is reached or 
exceeded. The relative movement of the inter-engaging 
elements can be employed to open a discharge passage for the 
pressure fluid, as by opening an exhaust valve. In order to effect full disengagement of the clutch 
device, the opened discharge passage provides for escape of 
the compressed air or other pressure fluid at a greater rate 
than it is being supplied. As the discharge passage will be 
open in the initial, disengaged, condition of the clutch 
device provision is made for a greater supply of pressure 
fluid during engagement than during normal running. This can 
be achieved by supplying the pressure fluid through a flow  
 
restrictor during normal operation. The clutch device of the invention can thus incorporate 
a pressure fluid exhaust valve arranged to open when a torque 
limit is reached or exceeded and a pressure fluid supply 
system comprising valve means connecting a pressure fluid 
source to the device initially through a non-return valve and 
through a flow restrictor subsequently, during normal 
operation. The flow restrictor is preferably by-passed by a 
non-return valve permitting discharge of the fluid pressure in 
the device by disconnection from the source when clutch 
disengagement is required. The invention is further described below, by way of 
example, with

<CLAIMS>
A fluid-pressure operated clutch device for engaging 
a driven member with a drive member on the application of 

fluid pressure, comprising torque limiting means in which 
mechanical sensing of a predetermined upper torque limit 

effects relief of fluid pressure in the clutch device to 
disengage the clutch. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 1, in which the 
mechanical sensing of the torque limit is effected by 

inter-engaging elements arranged for relative movement when 
the limit is reached. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 2 or 3, in which the 
inter-engaging elements are mounted in fixed relation to the 

drive member and driven member respectively so as to effect 
engagement of the clutch. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 2 or 3, in which the 
inter-engaging elements comprise at least one plunger, the 

or each plunger being arranged to be received in a 
corresponding socket during normal operation in the engaged 

condition of the clutch, and to be displaced therefrom when 
the torque limit is reached or exceeded. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 4, in which the or each 
plunger and socket have cooperating camming surfaces for 

effecting the displacement of the plunger. 
A clutch as claimed in any one of claims 2-5, in 
whic
h the relative movement of the inter-engaging elements 
causes a discharge passage for the pressure fluid to open. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 6, in which, in the 
engaged condition of the clutch, the discharge passage, when 

open, provides for escape of the pressure fluid at a greater 
rate than that at which it is supplied. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 6 or 7, in which, in 
the disengaged condition of the clutch, the discharge 

passage is open and a greater supply of pressure fluid is 
 

provided on engagement than in the fully engaged condition 
thereof. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 8, in which the 
pressure fluid is supplied through a flow restrictor in the 

fully engaged condition of the clutch. 
A clutch as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims in which the pressure fluid supply system comprises 

valve means for connecting a pressure fluid source to the 
device through a non-return valve in the disengaged 

condition of the clutch, and through a flow restrictor in 
the engaged condition of the clutch. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 10, in which the flow 
restrictor is by-passed by a non-return valve permitting 

discharge of the fluid pressure in the device by 
disconnection from the source when clutch disengagement is 

required. 
A fluid pressure operated clutch device comprising 
a pressure fluid exhaust valve arranged to open when a 

torque limit is reached or exceeded and a pressure fluid 
supply system comprising valve means for connecting a 

pressure fluid source to the device through a non-return 
valve in the disengaged condition of the clutch and through 

a flow restrictor in the engaged condition of the clutch. 
A clutch as claimed in claim 8, in which the flow 
restrictor is by-passed by a non-return valve permitting 

discharge of the fluid pressure in the device by 
disconnection from the source when clutch disengagement is 

required.
