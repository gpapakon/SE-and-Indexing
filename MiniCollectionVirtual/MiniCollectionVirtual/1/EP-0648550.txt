<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for decontaminating a polluted area below ground level. The area to be decontaminated (5) is circumscribed by constructing a leakproof side wall (6) reaching down from the surface of the ground to a depth greater than that of the area to be decontaminated (5); the surface of the ground above the area to be decontaminated is covered with an airtight top cover (7) whose perimeter makes a leaktight join with the top of the side wall (6); a depression is created underneath the top cover (7), for example by a vacuum pump (10), in order to set up an upward movement of water rising through the area to be decontaminated (5); and the updrawn water is disposed of.
