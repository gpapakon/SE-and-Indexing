<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disperse dye which 
is excellent in light-fastness (color fastness to light) 
and temperature dependency and which is capable of dyeing 
polyester fibers and polyamide fibers in an excellent 
orange to bluish red color. Particularly, it relates to 
a disperse dye mixture especially suitable for dyeing 
polyester fibers. In recent years, a demand for a disperse dye 
excellent in light-fastness and temperature dependency is 
high not only in the field of automobile seat material 
but also in the field of sport clothings employing Shin-Gosen 
textile material recently developed. However, 
heretofore, a dye excellent in both the light-fastness 
and temperature dependency has been rare, and no dye has 
been developed which is fully satisfactory in this 
respect. Especially, there has been no dye which is 
fully satisfactory as a dye to be used for dyeing fiber 
materials for automobile seats which are frequently  
 
exposed to extremely severe conditions. For example, dyes represented by the following 
structural formulas (a) to (c) are disclosed in Examples 
211, 213 and 215, respectively, of Japanese Examined 
Patent Publication No. 39347/1986, and a dye represented 
by the structural formula (d) is disclosed in Example 1 
of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2275/1991, 
and they are known as dyes excellent in light-fastness. 
However, they are inadequate in the dyeing temperature 
dependency and dyeability especially in a moderate dyeing 
depth. 
   Under these circumstances, the present inventors have 
conducted various studies with an aim to provide a 
disperse dye which is excellent in both light-fastness 
and temperature dependency and which is suitable 
particularly for dyeing polyester fibers for automobile 
seats and polyester fibers of Shin-Gosen textile. 
Particularly, extensive studies have been made to improve 
the temperature dependency and dyeability while 
maintaining the excellent light-fastness of an orange to 
bluish red disperse dye of the following formula (I): 
wherein X is a halogen atom, a nitro group, a cyano 
group, a thiocyanate group, a methylsulfonyl group, a C₁ 
or C₂ alkylcarbonyl group, a C₁-C₄ alkoxycarbonyl group 
or a vinylsulfonyl group, Y is a hydrogen atom, a halogen 
atom, a cyano group, a trifluoromethyl group or a 
methylsulfonyl group, W is a hydrogen atom, a halogen 
atom, a C₁ or C₂ alkyl group or a C₁ or C₂ alkoxy group, 
R¹ is a hydrogen atom, a C₁-C₈ alkoxyl group, or a C₂-C₄ 
alkyl group substituted by a halogen
