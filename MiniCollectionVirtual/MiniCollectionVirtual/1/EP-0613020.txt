<ABSTRACT>
The object detecting and tracking apparatus (1) detects a tracking 
target object from a moving image photographed by a television camera and 

tracks the same, wherein the movement of the object is detected reliably 
and with high accuracy to automatically track the target object. When 

tracking is started after putting the target object in a region designating 
frame "WAKU" displayed on a screen in such a way as to be variable in size 

and position, a video signal input from a photographic optical system 2 is 
Y/C-separated. After that, the target object is specified from a tracking 

region histogram, and movement vectors are obtained from a color-time-space 
image, color-time-space differential image, and/or luminance-time-space 

image thereof, thereby making it possible to more reliably detect 
even the movement of varied objects as compared with the conventional 

block matching.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a moving object
detecting and tracking apparatus which is suitable,
particularly, for tracking a target object by, for
example, moving a television camera in accordance with
the movement of the target object.Heretofore, when tracking a target object by
moving a television camera in accordance with the
movement of the target object, the movement of the
target object in an image photographed by the
television camera is first detected. Block matching is
a detection method generally adopted for this movement
detection. In block matching, an image inside a frame
is divided into a plurality of blocks, and correlative
calculation is performed on the target block in
relation to the next frame in which it is continuously
followed up in terms of time to determine its movement
on the basis of a minimum-error block regarded as the 
corresponding block.In movement detection by this block matching,
matching is effected without isolating the target
object from other objects or the background, so that
the final judgment is made based on a statistic
quantity. That is, if the correct correspondence is
not taken, movement determination can be effected by
selecting a block involving the minimum amount of
errors.However, in the above-described movement detection
method based on block matching, the correlative
calculation, which is performed on the target block and
the next frame continuously following the same in terms
of time, involves a great amount of calculation.
Further, there is a problem that a patternized object
movement cannot be detected.In addition, since it only consists of a simple
block matching in which movement detection is effected
on the basis of the correlation between the target
block and the next frame continuously following the
same in terms of time, the method cannot cope with any
change in the size of the object, the target object not
being specified. Thus, even when the object has
disappeared from the visual field, the position of 
minimum correlative calculation will be output as the
corresponding block, resulting in an erroneous movement
detection.An example of a prior art apparatus corresponding
to the preamble of claim 1 can be found in document US-A-4
364 089.In view of the foregoing, an object of this
invention is to provide a moving object detecting and
tracking apparatus which is capable of accurately and
securely detecting the movement of an object to
automatically follow the target object.The foregoing object and other objects of this
invention have been achieved
