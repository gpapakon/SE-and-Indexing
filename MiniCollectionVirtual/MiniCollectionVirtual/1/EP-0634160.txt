<ABSTRACT>
On the underside of a lifting plate (24) of a bath lift there is a valve housing (40) comprising an inlet valve (48) and an outlet valve (50). The two valves (48, 50) are selectively actuated by a joint rocker (76) which in turn is kept in the neutral position by the valve tappets of the two valves when not actuated. Pressure upon one end of the rocker (76) opens the inlet valve, so that the lifting plate (24) of the lift moves upwards. When the rocker (76) is released, the inlet valve (48) closes and when the other end of the rocker (76) is actuated, the outlet valve opens, so that water flows out from the lifting tube of the lift through an outlet opening (68) in the valve housing (42).

Bathtub lift for handicapped persons with a lifting plate 
(24) upwardly and downwardly guided on a support frame (14) 

and actuated by a hydraulic lifting device (26), and a 
valve device (40) featuring an inlet valve (48) and an 

outlet valve (50) whose valve plungers (52) are provided 
with a valve plate (54) respectively are actuable 

alternatively by a hand-operated rocker (76) provided with 
a pair of keys (80, 82) and a pair of operating surfaces 

(84, 86), whereby the two valve plungers (52) are of 
identical design, displaceably guided with parallel axes in 

a valve housing (42) and preloaded with their valve plates 
(54) upwardly against valve seats (58) respectively in the 

closed position of the plungers respectively by inbuilt 
springs, and a pressurized water feeding connection (44) 

communicating with a ring chamber (60) of the inlet valve 
(48), the ring chamber situated upstream from the valve 

seat (58) and a connection (46) leading to the lifting 
device (26) communicating with a second ring chamber (62) 

downstream from the valve seat (58) of the inlet valve 
(48), and the second ring chamber (62) communicating with 

an upstream ring chamber (64) of the outlet valve (50) via 
a bore (70) of the housing, a downstream ring chamber (66) 

of the outlet valve (50) communicating with a discharge 
opening (68) of the valve housing (42), whereby the rocker 

(76) is pivotably mounted about a transverse axis (78) 
centrally arranged between the axes of displacement of both 

valve plungers (52), both operating surfaces (84, 86) 
equally spaced from that transverse axis (78) and in a  

 
neutral position of the rocker (76) situated tightly 

adjacent above one of both valve plungers (52) respectively 
in the closed positions thereof, 
characterized in that
 the 
valve device (40) is fastened beneath the lifting plate 

(24) and the rocker (76) passes through recess (88) of the 
lifting plate (24) and projects slightly above its upper 

face and that at the valve plunger (52) of the inlet valve 
(48) a lifting element (90) engages which, in the lifting 

plate's limit of upward travel, cooperates with a control 
arm (100) displaceably guided beneath said lifting plate 

(24) and lifts the valve plunger (52) into its valve closed 
position whereby the motion of the control arm (100) is 

derived from that of the support frame (14) featuring two 
scissor frames (28, 32). 
Bathtub lift as claimed in claim 1 
characterized in that
 
the control arm (100) is capable of displacement parallel 

to the plane of the lifting plate by a slide bearing (20) 
displaceably guided along the lifting plate (24) and 

belonging to a scissor frame (32) of the support frame (14) 
near to the lifting plate's limit of upward travel and that 

between the control arm (100) and the lifting element (90) 
a 90Â° motion converter is provided so that a motion of the 

control arm (100) parallel to the lifting plate is 
converted into an actuation lift of the lifting element 

(90) at right angles to the original motion. 
Bathtub lift as claimed in claim 2 
characterized in that
 
the lifting element (90) consists of a pivoted lever which 

is pivotally supported wish one end adjacent to the  
 

transverse axis (78) of the rocker (76) and features at the 
other end a wedge face (94) which cooperates with the 

control arm (100) and that the pivoted lever (90) engages 
in an area between the ends of the valve plunger (52). 
Bathtub lift as claimed in claim 3 
characterized in that
 
the valve plunger (52) features outside the valve housing a 

neck-like constriction (74) which is held in a slot (92) of 
the pivoted lever (90). 
Bathtub lift as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 4 

characterized in that
 the outlet valve (50) is designed an 
excess pressure valve and the closing force of the spring 

(56) loading the valve plunger (52) is limited to a value 
which allows the valve plate (54) to be lifted from the 

valve seat (58) when the water pressure in the lifting 
device (26) exceeds a value within a range of 3 to 6 bar.
