<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic recording medium includes a polymer substrate having 
a multiplicity of surface protuberances, a thin-film magnetic layer formed 

on the polymer substrate, protective and lubricant layers formed on the 
polymer substrate so as to overlay the thin-film magnetic layer, with or 

without a non-magnetic undercoat intervening between the polymer substrate 
and the thin-film magnetic layer. The polymer substrate has a multiplicity 

of surface protuberances formed thereon. The density of the surface 
protuberances which have a height not smaller than 20 nm, is not greater 

than 2 per µm² while the density of the surface protuberances which have a 
height of not smaller than 10 µm, but smaller than 20 nm, is within the 

range of 0.1 to 15 per µm². The thin-film magnetic layer has a film thickness 
not greater than 0.12 µm and also has an easy magnetization axis 

inclined relative to normal to the film surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording
medium according to the preamble of claim 1.With the advent of the age of magnetic recording and/or reproducing
apparatuses having been designed in a high density, development of
a magnetic recording medium excellent in short wavelength
recording/reproducing characteristic has been longed for. While the
magnetic recording medium of a coated type comprising a substrate having a
magnetic powder coated thereon is currently employed, various attempts have
been carried out to improve characteristics to meet the requirement, but
appear to have reached the limitation.To break this limitation, a magnetic recording medium of a thin-film
type comprising a thin-film magnetic layer deposited on a polymer
substrate has come to be developed. This thin-film magnetic recording
medium is manufactured by the use of vacuum deposition,
sputtering or any other plating technique and has been found
to have excellent short wavelength recording/reproducing characteristics.
Use of Co, Co-Ni, Co-Ni-P, Co-O, Co-Ni-O, Co-Cr, Co-Ni-Cr and so on have
been examined as material for the thin-film magnetic layer and the length
of magnetic recording tape having a Co-Ni-O vapor-deposited magnetic layer
has currently commercialized as a Hi-8 scheme magnetic recording tape for
use with a video tape recorder having a Hi-8 scheme recording and/or
reproducing capability. K. Shinohara et al (Columnar Structure and Some Properties of Metal-Evaporated
Tape, IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, Vol. Mag-20 (1984) 824-826) report on
the development of metal evaporated video tapes (ME tapes) for highly competitive
and innovative mass-produced VTRs. A magnetic recording layer of a Co-Ni film of
0.15 µm was prepared by vacuum roll coating in an oxygen atmosphere using a
polyester substrate. The shape of the columnar grains forming the film is influenced
by this deposition system which has a continuously varied system incidence
and deposition rate. The anisotropic columnar structures and properties of the ME
tape were investigated. Moreover, the magnetic properties of a series of films
made by varying the minimum incident angle were investigated and the results of
the magnetic anisotropies and different recording characteristics of different tape
transport directions were presented. The still-frame life and the frictional behaviour
of the ME tape did not show anisotropies for tape transport.J. Hokkyo et al (Co-Ni Obliquely Evaporated Tape and its Magnetic and Recording
Characteristics, Journal of
