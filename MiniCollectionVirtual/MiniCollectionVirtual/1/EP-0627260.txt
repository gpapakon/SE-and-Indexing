<ABSTRACT>
A catalytic recombiner device for reacting two or 
more molecular species having dilute concentrations in 

fluids flowing in pipes (50) at elevated temperatures. 
The species are stable in the bulk fluid, but because 

of a high electrochemical potential, the species create 

conditions favorable to stress corrosion cracking in the 
pipe walls. If the pipe forms a portion of a coolant 

system, as in a nuclear power plant, the dissolved chemical 
species are transported and distributed throughout 

the system with undesirable consequences. To reduce the 
electrochemical potential, a cartridge (66, 80) having 

catalytic surfaces is installed in the flow upstream of 
the component to be protected against stress corrosion 

cracking. The catalytic surfaces of the cartridge form 
a small amount of benign reaction product (e.g. water), 

thereby reducing the concentration of undesirable species. 
The presence of a compact catalytic recombiner 

at strategic locations substantially reduces the electrochemical 
potential and protects both the piping and 

the vessels and internals connected to the piping from 
corrosive attack.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the catalytic 
reaction of two or more molecular species having dilute 
concentrations in fluids flowing in pipes at elevated 
temperatures. In particular, the invention relates to 
reducing the corrosion potential of components exposed 
to high-temperature (i.e., about 150°C or greater) 
water. In a boiling water reactor ("BWR"), the high-temperature 
(-288°C) water coolant is highly oxidizing due 
to dissolved radiolytically produced chemical species, 
such as oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. These molecules 
and/or compounds are generated as water passes through 
the reactor core and is exposed to very high gamma and 
neutron flux levels. Because of the resultant high 
electrochemical potential ("ECP"), reactor structural 
materials, such as stainless steels and nickel-based 
alloys, can suffer stress corrosion cracking ("SCC"). It is well known that SCC occurs at higher rates 
when oxygen is present in the reactor water in concentrations 
of about 5 ppb or greater. Stress corrosion 
cracking is further increased in a high radiation flux 
where oxidizing species, such as oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, 
and short-lived radicals are produced from 
radiolytic decomposition of the reactor water. Such 
oxidizing species increase the ECP of metals. Electrochemical 
corrosion is caused by a flow of electrons from  
 
anodic and cathodic areas on metallic surfaces. The ECP 
is a measure of the thermodynamic tendency for corrosion 
phenomena to occur, and is a fundamental parameter in 
determining rates of, e.g., SCC, corrosion fatigue, 
corrosion film thickening, and general corrosion. The useful lifetime of reactor components, such as 
piping and pressure vessel internal structures, can be 
limited by SCC. To date, SCC has resulted in a large 
inspection and repair cost in the nuclear industry and 
could eventually lead to premature decommissioning of 
BWR plants due to economic considerations. A number of countermeasures have been developed to 
mitigate SCC in BWRs by sufficiently reducing either the 
stress level, the material susceptibility to cracking, 
or the "aggressiveness" of the environment. Of the various 
mitigation strategies, reducing the environmental 
aggressiveness (i.e., oxidizing potential) can provide 
the broadest, most comprehensive approach, since the 
environment contacts all the potentially susceptible 
surfaces of interest. The primary strategy to reduce 
the ECP of the water to some benign value has been to 
add hydrogen gas to the reactor feedwater in
