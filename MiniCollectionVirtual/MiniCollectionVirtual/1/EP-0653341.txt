<ABSTRACT>
A trolley (1) has a base (2) supported on a plurality of 
wheels (6). A further wheel (8) is provided. Power is 

supplied to this further wheel (8) which is supported by a 
pivotally mounted support member (11). The contact 

pressure between the further wheel (8) and the ground may 
be varied between a first contact pressure when power is 

supplied to the further wheel (8) and a second contact 
pressure less than the first contact pressure when no 

power is supplied to the further wheel (8). The further 
wheel (8) also has a trolley turning position. In this 

trolley turning position, the trolley is turned about 
further wheel (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a trolley and 
particularly to a powered trolley which is suitable for 
use in moving heavy loads in confined areas, for example, 
for moving books in a library or laundry and equipment in 
a hospital. In many environments, particularly at work, it is often 
necessary for objects which are heavy to be moved. In 
warehouses or the like this is done by means of machinery 
such as fork lift trucks. However, such machinery is not 
suitable where there is a lack of space and/or where the 
objects to be moved are individually light in weight and 
are loaded individually but are moved in groups, the 
cumulative weight of which is large. Moreover, such 
machinery is often expensive to acquire and maintain and 
the cost is prohibitive where the movement of objects is 
not a continuous operation. Hence, in many environments 
such as supermarkets, libraries and hospitals 
traditionally trolleys which must be pushed or pulled by 
the employees have been used to move objects. Trolleys 
have the advantage of being very manoeuvrable particularly 
when they are supported on swivel mounted wheels. On the 
other hand, although the loading and off-loading of such 
trolleys is not physically demanding where the individual 
objects are lightweight, the pushing or pulling of the 
loaded trolley can be very physically demanding and can 
all too easily cause injury. Moreover, it is well known 
that trolleys which use swivel mounted wheels can be 
difficult to control and keep in a straight line when 
moving. This is especially the case when the trolley is 
carrying a heavy load. The present invention seeks to overcome disadvantages such 
as those described above of traditional trolleys. In 
addition, the present invention seeks to provide a trolley  
 
suitable for moving heavy loads which is easily 
manoeuvrable within a confined space and so is 
particularly suited for use in the office, in libraries, 
hospitals, supermarkets or the like. The present invention provides a trolley comprising a base 
supported on a plurality of wheels and driving means 
connected to at least one further wheel, the further wheel 
being supported by a wheel support frame which enables 
movement of the further wheel between a driven position 
and a trolley turning position. In a further aspect the present invention provides a 
trolley having a base supported on a plurality of wheels 
and a further wheel, there being means for supplying power 
to the further wheel and the further wheel being supported 
by a

<CLAIMS>
A trolley comprising a base supported on a plurality 
of wheels and driving means connected to at least one 

further wheel, the further wheel being supported by a 
wheel support frame which enables movement of the further 

wheel between a driven position and a trolley turning 
position. 
A trolley having a base supported on a plurality of 
wheels and a further wheel, there being means for 

supplying power to the further wheel and the further wheel 
being supported by a pivotally mounted support member 

whereby the contact pressure between the further wheel and 
the ground may be varied between a first contact pressure 

when power is being supplied to the further wheel and a 
second contact pressure less than said first contact 

pressure when no power is being supplied to the further 
wheel. 
The trolley as claimed in either of claims 1 or 2, 
wherein the further wheel is located substantially 

centrally of the base of the trolley. 
The trolley as claimed in claim 3, wherein the 
further wheel is mounted in an opening provided in the 

base of the trolley. 
The trolley as claimed in claim 1, wherein the wheel 
support frame comprises side members supporting a support 

member which is fixedly connected to the further wheel, 
the support member being capable of pivoting about its 

mounting with the side members. 
The trolley as claimed in claim 5, wherein a side 
member is mounted either side of the further wheel with 

the support member extending between the side members 
above the further wheel. 
The trolley as claimed in claim 4 and claim 6, 
wherein the side members are mounted either side of the 

opening provided in the base. 
The trolley as claimed in either claim 2 or claim 5, 
wherein, when the trolley is at rest, a line passing 

through the pivot axis of the support member and the 
rotational axis of the further wheel is at an angle of 

between 5 to 10 degrees to the vertical. 
The trolley as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the further wheel is driven by an electric 

motor. 
The trolley as claimed in claim 8, wherein the 
electric motor is powered by a battery mounted on the 

trolley. 
The trolley as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the plurality of wheels are in the form of 

a plurality of casters. 
The trolley as claimed in claim 11, wherein there are 
four casters. 
The trolley as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
wherein all of the wheels of the plurality of 
wheels make contact with the ground simultaneously.
