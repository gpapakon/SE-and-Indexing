<ABSTRACT>
A terminal element (13) for the channel (3) of a 
window regulating device (1) including a main guide body 

(12) for supporting a slide (4) with window connecting 
means (18), and a cable activating device for moving the 

slide (4) along the guide body (12); the terminal 
element (13) presenting an integral wall (45) with a 

curved portion (47) for sliding support of the cable 
(6); a slot (37) for snap-on connection of a tab (39) on 

an end portion (29) of the guide body (12); and a 
conduit (66) for housing in fixed manner one end of a 

sheath (19) in turn housing the cable (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a terminal 
element for a window regulator channel, preferably for 
vehicles. More specifically, the present invention relates 
to a window regulator of the type comprising a channel, 
a slide connected to a sliding window with which it runs 
along the channel, and a slide activating device; the 
activating device comprising a cable connected to the 
slide and extending along at least part of a loop path; 
and provision being made for an actuator assembly 
connected to the cable for moving it axially along said 
path, and at least one sheath portion for a 
corresponding portion of the cable and extending between 
fixed points of said path. The channel normally comprises a main body made of 
sheet metal and fitted to a frame normally consisting of 
a portion of the vehicle door. The ends of the main body 
of the channel are fitted with terminal elements for 
arresting the slide, and roller elements are provided 
for guiding the cable from the path along the channel  
 
into the sheaths towards the activating device. On account of the number of elements at each end 
of the main body of the channel, assembly of such 
channels is relatively time-consuming, thus increasing 
the cost of the regulator as a whole. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a perfected terminal element for a window 
regulator channel, which is relatively straightforward 
and hence cheap to produce and assemble. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a terminal element for the channel of a window 
regulator comprising a main body for supporting a slide 
presenting window connecting means; and a cable 
activating device for moving said slide along said main 
body; characterized in that said terminal element 
presents integral means for sliding support of said 
cable. A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention 
will be described by way of example with reference to 
the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows a schematic side view of a window 
regulator featuring a channel with terminal elements in 
accordance with the present invention; Figure 2 shows a larger-scale view of a terminal 
element of the Figure 1 channel; Figure 3 shows a top plan view of the Figure 2 
element; Figure 4 shows a partially sectioned side view of  
 
the Figure 2 element; Figures 5 and 6 show respective sections along 
lines V-V and VI-VI in Figure 2; Figure 7 shows a further embodiment of the Figure 
2 element. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates a window regulator 
for two-way
