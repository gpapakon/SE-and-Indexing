<ABSTRACT>
A battery has a through-hole traversing a battery main body 
and opened to outside. The battery has a vessel having a central 

through-hole, and a spiral-shaped electrode, made up of a strip-shaped 

positive electrode and a strip-shaped negative electrode 
wound about a cylindrical core a number of times with a separator 

in-between, is mounted in the battery vessel so that an opening 
of the cylindrical core is substantially coincident with the 

through-hole in the battery vessel. The battery vessel is sealed 
after charging a liquid electrolyte. One or more thin metal 

plates are inserted and secured in the through-hole, or one or 
more heat-dissipating fins are radially formed around the opening 

end of the through-hole. The battery has good heat-dissipating 
properties and is superior in strength and energy density.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a battery 
according to the preamble of claim 1. As an example of such a prior-art battery, a battery having a through-hole 
is discloded in US-A-4,262,064 (or FR-A-53 670).  
 Such a battery is subject to storage of heat and rise in temperature 
due to the heat of reaction of the electrodes resulting from 
charging/discharging and the Joule heat by the current flowing 
through the electrodes or the current collectors. Such phenomenon becomes outstanding when the battery is 
increased in size. For combatting such phenomenon, a cooling 
fluid may be caused to flow through the through-hole of the battery or through a passage for a cooling fluid (EP-A-0 044 753). 
However, the energy 
density of the electric source system in its entirety is lowered 
due to the increase in volume or weight caused by the provision 
of the cooling system.  
 It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
battery whereby the problem of temperature rise may be overcome 
without decreasing the energy density or mechanical strength. For accomplishing the above object, the present invention 
provides a battery in which a through-hole traversing a main 
battery body and opened to outside is formed at a central region 
of the main battery body, wherein at least one thin metal plate is inserted and secured within the through-hole. According to the present invention, only the through-hole and at least one thin metal plate is inserted and secured within the through-hole 
is formed as heat dissipating means, while there is no necessity 
of providing complex cooling means for heat dissipation. 
Consequently, the energy density is not lowered due to the weight 
or the capacity of the cooling means. Also, the surface area of 
the battery may be maintained without the necessity of using a 
planar or elongated shape of the battery, so that the battery 
itself is not lowered in strength.  
 Also by forming heat dissipating fins 
around the opening end of the through-hole, heat dissipation may 
be improved further, whereas the heat generated by 
charging/discharging of large current may be efficiently 
dissipated. Fig. 1 is a schematic perspective view showing an embodiment 
of a columnar-shaped battery according to the present invention, but without showing the thin metal plates in the through-hole. Fig. 2 is a schematic cross-sectional view showing the inner 
structure of the columnar-shaped battery shown in Fig.1 during 
the fabrication process.
