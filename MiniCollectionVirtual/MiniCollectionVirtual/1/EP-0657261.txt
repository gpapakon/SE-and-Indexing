<ABSTRACT>
A device for dosing, mixing and applying a mortar 
suitable for pointing, bricklaying and/or floors and 

consisting of at least an adhering or binding agent such as 
a cement and a sand fraction in addition to water, said 

device consisting of a housing (55) slidable relative to the 
outlet of the silo (1) and provided with a number of dosing 

chambers (56) and with a valve (60) closing the outlet opening of a 
silo, wherein beneath the slidable housing is arranged a 

fixed base plate having a passage opening moved relative to 
the outlet opening of the silo for discharging the fractions 

out of the dosing housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for dosing
and mixing fractions for a mortar suitable for pointing,
bricklaying and/or floors and consisting of at least a
bonding agent or binder such as a cement and a sand
fraction provided with a silo having compartments for
each fraction, a dosing unit arranged under the silo,
said dosing unit consisting of a housing slidable
relative to the outlet of the silo and provided with a
number of dosing chambers and with a valve closing the
outlet opening of a silo, wherein beneath the slidable
housing is arranged a fixed base plate having a passage
opening offset relative to the outlet opening of the silo
for discharging the fractions out of the dosing housing.Such a device is disclosed in US-A-3,746,313.Owing to a dosing unit having a number of
dosing chambers, the mass to be mixed is always in the
correct ratio for the specific application of the mortar.
However, as one or more fractions can have a sticky
nature the dosing unit can not be filled or emptied
completely during said dosing process.Therefore the invention recommends a measuring
means attached to the base plate in order to measure the
zero weight and the maximum weight of the dosing unit, so
determining in a simple manner the correct ratio for the
mixture. In order to fill up the different dosing
chambers with the fractions from the silo the invention
further suggests to provide the dosing unit with a
shaking or vibrating means, for example a motor having
eccentric masses. Mentioned and other features will be further
elucidated in the figure description hereinbelow of a
number of embodiements. In the drawing: 
Fig. 1 is a perspective top view of the underside
of the silo with dosing unit according to the invention,fig. 2 is a side view of the embodiment of fig. 1,
which is provided here, however, with a weight measuring
means.Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the silo 1 and
dosing unit, wherein the dosing unit consists of a dosing
housing 55 provided with three dosing chambers 56. The
latter connect onto the compartment silo 1 which is provided
here with two partitions 2'. Because the partitions are
arranged at a determined position in the dosing housing 55,
the content of the dosing chamber 56 in the dosing housing
55 will differ depending on the desired volumetric mixing of
the fractions for the mortar. The dosing housing 55 is
closed on the underside by a fixed base plate 57 which leads
to a passage opening 58 of a downward oriented funnel 59.
The funnel 59 connects for instance onto a mixing device.The
