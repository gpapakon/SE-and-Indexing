<ABSTRACT>
A sheet-form piezoelectric device having 
improved mechanical strengths as represented by an 

electrode peel strength while retaining flexibility 
and piezoelectric performances of a polymer-type 

piezoelectric device, is obtained by embedding a 
perforated sheet electrode into at least one surface 

layer of a polymer piezoelectric film treated with a 
solvent in advance. The sheet-form piezoelectric 

device may be wound or curved about a certain central 
axis to provide a tubular or curved piezoelectric 

device having wave-transmitting and/or -receiving 
characteristics suitable for wave-transmitting and/or 

-receiving devices, such as a hydrophone and 
microphone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer-type
piezoelectric device having a perforated sheet
electrode
and a process of producing of
such piezoelectric devices.A polymeric piezoelectric material as
represented by a polarized vinylidene fluoride resin
(hereinafter representatively called "PVDF") has many
advantageous characteristics as follows compared with
a ceramic piezoelectric material.
(1) It has a large flexibility, is readily formed
into a film or in a large area or a long size, and
thus can be formed into an arbitrary shape or form.(2) It has a hydrostatic piezoelectric constant
dh which is only identical to or even smaller than
that of a ceramic piezoelectric material, but has a
very large hydrostatic piezoelectric constant gh
determined by dh/ε because of a small dielectric
constant ε. Accordingly, it has an excellent
sensitivity.(3) It has a low density and a low elasticity, so
that it has a specific acoustic impedance (= sonic 
propagation velocity x density) which is close to that
of water or a living body. Accordingly, it can
achieve an effective energy transmission accompanied
with little reflection at a boundary between the
device and water or a living body.Because of such advantageous characteristics,
a polymeric piezoelectric material has been proposed
or commercialized generally as an electric-mechanic
(acoustic) transducer or a pyroelectric transducer for
a wide variety of uses, such as speaker, microphone,
ultrasonic probe, hydrophone, vibration gauge, strain
gauge, haemodynamometer, and bimorph fan.In case of incorporating a polarized film or
sheet or polymeric piezoelectric material (hereinafter
inclusively referred to as "polymer piezoelectric
film") into a device or transducer, the film is
generally provided with an electrode on both surfaces
thereof. As the electrode, there has been generally
used a vapor-deposited electrode of a metal, such as
copper or aluminum, or a foil electrode of such a
metal applied with an adhesive, in view of a
relatively low heat resistance of around 100 °C of a
polymeric piezoelectric material inclusive of a
piezoelectric characteristic provided by orientation-polarization,
etc. Our research group has also
proposed a thermally sprayed electrode of a relatively
low-melting metal, such as zinc, thermally sprayed 
into a layer (EP-A 0528279). However, these
electrodes respectively involve difficulties as
described below.First of all, a vapor-deposited electrode has
only a small thickness on the order of 0.02 - 0.1 µm
and has only a small adhesion with
