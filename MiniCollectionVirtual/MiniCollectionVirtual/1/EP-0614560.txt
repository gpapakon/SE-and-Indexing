<ABSTRACT>
Method and means for preventing trespassing and/or unauthorized staying in an area outdoors or indoors, e.g. in a building, part of a building, in vehicles, vessels, etc., wherein sound signals with varying frequencies are transmitted out of phase in relation to each other from several sound generators in such directions that the sound waves from the sound generators meet within the area to be protected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method and a means for preventing
trespassing and/or unauthorized staying in an area outdoors or
indoors, e.g. in a building, part of a building, in vehicles,
vessels.Prior art alarms installed for protection of property against
theft or damage have the disadvantage that the intruder can
continue the activity until somebody reacts on the alarm and may
thus also have time to finish the activity and leave the place
before the alarm personnel reach the place.There are also noice generating devices which are used for
keeping away noxius animals and such, one example being disclosed
in the French Patent Publication NÂº 2556485. The device
according to this publication can work with several sirens
which can work with different frequencies and be controlled
separately. It is said that this gives rise to an unbearable
sound. However, it has been shown that animals such as rodents
can get used to a noice and therefore return to the sound laden
area. The device according to this publication is also said to
be useful as a protective alarm. The human organ of hearing is
however adjustable and also contains protective mechanisms which
to a certain extent protect against high sounds, and consequently
the usefulness of the means according to the French patent
publication is highly unreliable also for this purpose.The object of the present invention is to provide a method
and a means for generating of sound which is unendurable for
humans and/or animals and which makes it impossible to stay
within the field of operation of the means.This is achieved with the method according to the present
invention which is characterized in that sound signals with
varying frequencies are transmitted out of phase in relation to
each other from several sound generators in such directions that
the sound waves from the sound generators meet within the area
to be protected. According to one embodiment of the invention, sound signals
are transmitted with frequencies which periodically rise from and
then return to the basic frequency.According to another embodiment of the invention, sound
signals are transmitted with frequencies successively rising from
the basic frequency and abruptly returning back to the basic
frequency.According to a further embodiment of the invention the basic
frequency for the sound signals are changed after predetermined
time intervals. Hereby the risc of somebody quenching the sound
signals with the aid of a counter sound generator is avoided.According to a further embodiment of the

<CLAIMS>
Method for preventing trespassing and/or unauthorized staying
in an area outdoors or indoors, e.g. in a buildin
g, part of a
building, in vehicles, vessels, 
characterized in
 that
sound signals with varying frequencies are transmitted out of

phase in relation to each other from several sound generators in
such directions that the sound waves from the sound generators

meet within the area to be protected.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that sound
signals are transmitted with frequencies which periodically rise

from and return to a basic frequency.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that sound
signals are transmitted with frequencies which successively rise

from the basic frequency and abruptly fall back to the basic
frequency.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 3, 
characterized in

that the basic frequency for the sound signals are changed after
a certain predetermined time interval.
Method according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the basic
frequency is changed every tenth second.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that a phase
shift between the sound signals in the order of milliseconds is

used.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 6, 
characterized in

that a sound level of 110 dB and up is used.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 7, 
characterized in

that sound signals from at least four sound generators are used.
Means for preventing trespassing and/or unauthorized staying
in an area outdoors or indoors, e.g. in a building, part of a

building, in vehicles, vessels, for performing the method
according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that it comprises several
sound generators with control means for generating sound signals

with varying frequencies transmitted out of phase in relation to
each other from said sound generators, whereby the sound generators

are so directed that the sound waves from the sound generators
meet within the area to be protected.
Means according to claim 9, 
characterized in
 that comprises
at least 4 sound generators.
