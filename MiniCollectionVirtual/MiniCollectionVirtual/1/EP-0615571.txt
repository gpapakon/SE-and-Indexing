<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cutter of a boring head, and also to a hub constituting a part of the cutter, and a method of manufacturing a hub. The cutter (10; 10') is rotatably mounted in a saddle in the boring head. A roller bearing means is located between the shaft (11; 11') and the hub (18; 18') of the cutter. In order to improve the bearing capacity of the cutters, the outer races (17; 17'a, 17'b) for the rollers (15; 15'a, 15'b) of the roller bearing means, are integral with the hub. In the method of manufacturing of a hub (18; 18'), those portions of the hub which are not to be hardened are left unfinished or covered by a layer that prevents carburization. The hub can then have different properties in different portions in order to comply with tolerances and specifications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to methods of manufacturing
a hub adapted to constitute a part of a cutter of a
boring head, said cutter being rotatably mounted, via a
shaft of the cutter, in a saddle secured to the boring
head, said hub being rotatable relative to the shaft via
a tapered roller bearing means, the blank of the hub
being created by suitable machining. This invention
deals with cutters both for tunnel boring heads and
raise boring heads.Prior art roller bearings for cutters of tunnel boring
heads, see e.g. US-A-4,784,438 and US-A-3,216,513 (Figs.
1 and 2), usually have tapered rollers that are located
between an inner and an outer race of the bearing. The
circumferential distance between the tapered rollers is
controlled by a cage that also is located between the
inner and outer races. Since the inner race is
stationary, i.e. not rotatable relative to the shaft,
said inner race will be subjected to high stresses
within a very limited area of its circumference. This
means that the inner race will be damaged relatively
soon compared to the outer race that rotates relative to
the inner race and thus is worn evenly. The consequence
of this is that it is favorable to have the inner race
as a separate element that is exchangeable when the
inner race is worn out. However, there is no need to
have the outer race as a separate element since the 
outer race will normally last for the entire life of the
cutter.The same type of roller bearing is also known for raise
boring cutters, see e.g. US-A-4,509,607. In principle
the same disadvantages apply as in a cutter for tunnel
boring.US-A-3,216,513 further discloses in Figs. 3 and 4, a
cutter assembly having cylindrical and spherical rollers
running in outer races integral with the hub. The
cylindrical and spherical rollers together require a hub
with a relatively large axial extension and cannot be
used in connection with narrow, disc-shaped cutters for
tunnel boring.The aim of the present invention is to disclose methods
to manufacture a hub adapted to constitute a part of a
cutter that has a considerably increased load bearing
capacity and a longer life without demanding more room
for the roller bearing. The aim of the present invention
is realized by methods that have been given the
characteristics of the appended claims. Below two
embodiments of a cutter are described, reference being
made to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 shows
a partially sectioned view of a cutter for tunnel boring
with a hub manufactured according to the present
invention

Method of manufacturing a hub (18;18') adapted to
constitute a part of a cutter (10;10') of a boring head,

said cutter (10;10') being rotatably mounted, via a
shaft (11;11') of the cutter, in a saddle secured to the

boring head, said hub (18;18') being rotatable relative
to the shaft via a tapered roller bearing means, the

blank of the hub being created by suitable machining,

characterized
 in that the blank of the hub
(18;18') includes raw material for outer races

(17;17'a,17'b) for sets of tapered rollers of the roller
bearing means, said raw material being integral with the

hub (18;18'), such that the hub (18;18') uninterruptedly
extends from said raw material to the periphery of the

blank of the hub, that the raw material of the blank

that is to be hardened, is machined to almost finished
shape while the portions of the blank which are not to

be hardened are left with an additional layer of a few
millimeters, that the blank of the hub then is subjected

to carburizing, that the blank of the hub then again is
machined to remove the additional layer, that the blank

of the hub then is heat-treated in order to harden the
portions having almost finished shape, and that the raw

material for the outer races (17;17'a,17'b) is subjected
to further surface treatment in order to comply with

tolerances and other specifications.
