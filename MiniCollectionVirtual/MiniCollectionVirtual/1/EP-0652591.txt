<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a radiation hardened SOI structure is 
disclosed. The buried oxide layer (42) of an SOI structure is 

hardened prior to the boding of a device wafer which forms the 
silicon portion of the silicon-on-insulator. The radiation 

hardening is done by implantation of recombination center-generating 
impurities. All the radiation hardening is done 

prior to the bonding of the device silicon layer and allows 
for radiation hardening of the buried oxide layer of an SOI 

structure without any damage to the silicon device layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silicon-on-insulator (SOI)
structures, and more particularly, to radiation hardening of
integrated circuits built upon SOI structures.Much work has been spent developing integrated circuits based
on silicon-on-insulator technology. The SOI structure of a
very thin silicon film on an insulating substrate, shown in
Figure 1, results in advantages such as faster circuit speeds,
reduced power consumption, and smaller circuits.Although SOI technology has these many advantages, it is at
a disadvantage relative to bulk silicon for hardness against
total dose radiation. The presence of the buried insulator
layer creates an additional oxide that must be hardened. As a
result of its thickness, sufficient amounts of positive charge
are trapped in the insulator following total dose radiation.
The charge accumulation results in increased device leakage
and threshold voltage shifts.The method to radiation harden bulk silicon devices is
for itself prior art.What would be desirable, is a method whereby an SOI structure
can be formed such that the buried oxide traps only a very low
net negative charge after total dose radiation exposure. In
hardening SOI structures for total dose applications, two
variations of the SOI structure need to be considered, a thin 
film fully depleted (FD) structure and a thick film SOI
structure being partially depleted (PD). The difference
between the FD and PD, is that when the FD transistor is
turned off, the depletion regions formed by the transistor
gate and buried oxide overlap, depleting the entire silicon
film and the transistor body. In partially depleted
transistors, these regions do not overlap, thus, leaving a
neutral region in the body. As a result of these differences,
charges generated in the buried oxide are reflected
proportionally in the transistor gate in fully depleted
transistors but not in partially depleted transistors. For
both transistors, charges in the buried oxide attract carriers
to the body/buried oxide interface. When sufficient carriers
are attracted to the interface, a parasitic conductive path is
formed, resulting in increases in the transistor leakage. Due
to the softness of conventional buried oxides, this leakage
path occurs at very low radiation dosages, making it difficult
to use fully depleted SOI technology in applications requiring
radiation hardened electronics (e.g., missiles, nuclear
reactors).Several methods of improving the useful total radiation dose
for SOI circuits are known. These techniques include the use
of
