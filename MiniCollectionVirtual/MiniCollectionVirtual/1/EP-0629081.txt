<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining a noise component in a video signal is specified, a motion signal being formed by forming the difference between an undelayed and a delayed video signal followed by forming an absolute value. In this method, an amplitude peak of the motion signal is first determined within a search window and then a minimum which corresponds to the peak value of the noise is determined from the peak values of a number of search windows.

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining a noise component in a video signal, in which a motion
signal (L) is formed by subtracting an undelayed and a delayed video signal and by

subsequently forming the absolute value,
characterized in that

an amplitude maximum (M) of the motion signal is initially determined within a
plurality of search windows and in that subsequently a minimum corresponding to the

noise peak value is determined from the maximum values of the search windows.
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that

the determination of the amplitude maximum is interrupted during the horizontal and
vertical blanking intervals of the video signal.
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that

the search windows are one-dimensional.
A method as claimed in claim 3,
characterized in that

up to 20 search windows per line are provided.
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that

the search windows are two-dimensional.
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that

the minimum value is determined from the maximum values of a plurality of search 
windows within at least one field period.
A circuit for performing the method as claimed in claim 1,

characterized by

a device (3) for forming the difference value and the absolute value, having a
first input for an undelayed video signal and a second input for a delayed video

signal,
a maximum peak value measuring circuit (4) whose input is connected to the
output of the device (3) for forming the difference value and the absolute value,

whose start input conveys a start pulse (S) each time at the start of a search
window,
a first register (5) for storing the maximum values supplied by the maximum
peak value measuring circuit (4), whose input is connected to the output of the

maximum peak value measuring circuit (4) and whose clock input also conveys
a start pulse (S),
a minimum peak value measuring circuit (6) whose input is connected to the
output of the first register (5), whose start input conveys a H-frequency or V-frequency

pulse at the end of a blanking interval,
a second register (7) for storing the minimum values supplied by the minimum
peak value measuring circuit (6), whose input is connected to the output of the

minimum peak value measuring circuit (6) and whose clock input also conveys
a H-frequency or V-frequency pulse and from whose output the noise signal (P)

can be derived.
A circuit as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that

a H-frequency or V-frequency pulse is applied to a control input (E) of the maximum
peak value measuring circuit (4) at the start of the blanking interval.
