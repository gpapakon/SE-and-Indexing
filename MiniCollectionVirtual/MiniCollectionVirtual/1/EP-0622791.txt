<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-optic memory and a magnetic material is described 
incorporating a polarized light
 beam directed towards a 
magnetic material and an analyzer for intercepting the 

polarized light beam after passing through the magnetic 
material or after being reflected by the magnetic material. 

The magnetic material includes a matrix of metal such as 
iron, cobalt, nickel, and alloys thereof and a plurality of 

separated phases distributed in the matrix such as EuS, 
EuO, EuOTb, PtMnSb, MnAs, MnBi, MnSb, CrO₂, CrTe, GdN, 

Gd₄C, other compounds of a rare earth element and manganese 
compounds. Terbium or neodymium may be dissolved in the 

matrix of metal and in the plurality of separated phases. 
The invention overcomes the problem of providing a magnetic 

material having a Curie point above room temperature, a 
square perpendicular hysteresis loop at room temperature, a 

large magneto-optic rotation at the wavelength of interest 
and a deposition temperature suitable depositing on polymer 

substrates.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magneto-optic memory utilizing
composite magnetic materials exhibiting magneto-optic rotation
and, more particularly, to particles such as europium
sulfide dispersed throughout a ferromagnetic matrix which
are coupled anti-ferromagnetically at their interface.Magnetic materials for magneto-optic media must have a
number of key properties. Magnetic materials must have a
Curie point above room temperature, a square perpendicular
hysteresis loop at room temperature, a large magneto-optic
rotation at the wavelength of interest such as 800nm for
current products and 400nm for future products and their
deposition should be at a low enough temperature to be compatible
with both glass and polymer substrates. Magnetic
materials must not exhibit grain noise which means they
must be either amorphous, microcrystalline or highly oriented
crystallographically. A random polycrystalline film
will give an unacceptably high grain noise.One example of a prior art magneto-optical data storage
system is described in U.S. Patent 3,475,738 which issued
on October 28, 1969 to H.P. Louis et al. wherein a high
permanent ferromagnetic metal is covered with a layer of
transparent, ferromagnetic, semiconducting material such as
a rare-earth chalcogenide under conditions such that these
two layers are in a magnetically exchange-coupled relationship.
A beam of light is directed through the transparent 
Semiconducting layer wherein it is reflected back through
the layer by the ferromagnetic metal and exhibits rotation
of the polarized light beam. While ferromagnetic
semiconductors such as EuO, EuS or EuSe provide on the
order of 800° rotation per decibel of optical energy loss,
the Curie points for these materials are below room
temperature. For example, the Curie point for EuO is 72°K,
the Curie point for EuS is 19°K and the Curie point for
EuSe is 7°K. Thus, if one of these materials was used for
the magneto-optic media, the material must be maintained at
temperatures which are in the cryogenic temperature range
to keep them below their respective Curie temperature.R.J. Gambino et al. Describe in J.Appl.Phys., vol. 70, 15
Nov 1991, No. 10, part II, pages 6368-6388 a method to
increase the Curie point of EuO and EuS by codepositing
these materials with Fe or by doping with Tb.Another example of a prior art magneto-thermal recording
layer is described in GB-A-1 160 057. This layer consists
or a ferromagnetic material with interspersed small
particles of an antiferromagnetic material (e.g. Fe-FeS).Thus, it
