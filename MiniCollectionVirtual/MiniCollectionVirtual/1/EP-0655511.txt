<ABSTRACT>
The heat-resistant, ferritic cast steel of a high 
castability has a composition consisting essentially, by weight, of 

C: 0.15-1.20%, C-Nb/8: 0.05-0.45%, Si: 2% or less, Mn: 2% or less, 
Cr: 16.0-25.0%, W and/or Mo: 1.0-5.0%, Nb: 0.40-6.0%, Ni: 0.1-2.0%, 

N: 0.01-0.15%, and Fe and inevitable impurities: balance. 
The cast steel has, in addition to a usual α-phase, and α'-phase 

transformed from a γ-phase and composed of an α-phase and 
carbides. The area ratio 


(α'/(α + α')) 
 
 of the α'-phase is 20-70%. 

The heat-resistant, ferritic cast steel of a high castability is 
suitable for exhaust
 equipment members such as exhaust 
manifolds, turbine housings, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-resistant cast
steel suitable for exhaust equipment members, etc. for
automobile engines, and more particularly to a heat-resistant
cast steel having excellent durability such as a thermal fatigue
resistance, thermal deformation resistance and oxidation
resistance, castability and machinability, which can be produced
at a low cost, and an exhaust equipment member made of such a
heat-resistant cast steel.Conventional heat-resistant cast iron and heat-resistant
cast steel have compositions shown in Table 1 as
Comparative Examples. Exhaust equipment members such as
exhaust manifolds, turbine housings, etc. for automobiles are
exposed to extremely severe conditions at high temperatures.
Therefore, as materials for such exhaust equipment members,
heat-resistant cast iron such as high-Si spheroidal graphite cast
iron, NI-RESIST cast iron (Ni-Cr-Cu austenite cast iron), etc.
shown in Table 1, heat-resistant, ferritic cast steel disclosed in
JP-A-2-175841 (USP 5,106,578) and exceptionally expensive
heat-resistant, high-alloy cast steel such as austenite cast steel,
etc. have been employed.Among these conventional heat-resistant cast iron
and heat-resistant cast steel, for instance, high-Si spheroidal 
graphite cast iron and NI-RESIST cast iron are relatively good in
castability, but they are poor in durability such as a thermal
fatigue resistance and an oxidation resistance. Accordingly, they
cannot be used for members which may be subjected to such a
high temperature as 900°C or higher. Heat-resistant ferritic cast
steel disclosed in JP-A-2-175841 is good in thermal fatigue
resistance but poor in thermal deformation resistance. Also,
heat-resistant, high-alloy cast steel such as heat-resistant
austenite cast steel, etc. is excellent in a high-temperature
strength and thermal deformation resistance at 900°C or higher,
but the high-alloy cast steel is poor in a thermal fatigue
resistance due to a large thermal expansion coefficient. Further,
because of poor castability, the high-alloy cast steel is likely to
suffer from casting defects such as shrinkage cavities and poor
fluidity in casting process. In addition, because of poor
machinability, the production of parts from the high-alloy cast
steel is not efficient. Besides the above cast iron and cast steel,
ferritic cast stainless steel has been known. However, usual
ferritic cast stainless steel shows poor ductility at room
temperature when its high-temperature durability is improved.
Accordingly, ferritic cast stainless
