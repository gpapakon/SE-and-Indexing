<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a process which comprises isomerizing a compound having an aldose structure into a compound having a ketose structure, by the use of or in the presence of an organogermanium compound having a structural portion represented by formula (I) and an isomerization agent or accelerator effective for the isomerization of a compound having an aldose structure into a compound having a ketose structure, which agent or accelerator comprises, as an active component, an organogermanium compound having a structural portion represented by formula (I). Owing to the use or presence of the above organogermanium compound, said process is free from the problems of prior art and capable of isomerizing a compound having an aldose structure into a compound having a ketose structure at a high isomerization ratio without requiring any special apparatus or any complicated operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
isomerizing a compound having an aldose structure into a
compound having a ketose structure, as well as to an
isomerization agent or accelerator used in said process.FR-A-2316246 relates to a process for transforming
an aldose or an aldose derivative into a ketose
or a ketose derivative, and particularly to the process
for transforming glucose into fructose, wherein said
process is carried out in the presence of a reactive
complexant which is constituted by a germanium or tin
oxyanion or mixed complex oxyanion which forms a
stronger complex with the ketose or ketose derivative
than with the aldose or aldose derivative. The only
examples of said oxyanions are those derived from
inorganic germanium compounds such as sodium germanate
or germanium oxide. Carbohydrates are organic compounds which are
very important to living things as their energy sources,
etc. and which are present most abundantly on the earth.
They are composed mainly of monosaccharides. These
monosaccharides have typical structures in which 3 to 8
carbon atoms are bonded in a ring and the structures are
largely classified into two types.That is, said structures are classified into aldose
(an aldehyde-containing monosaccharide) and ketose
(a ketone-containing monosaccharide). Both aldose and
ketose are further classified into respective trioses,
tetroses, pentoses and hexoses depending upon the carbon
atom number of aldose or ketose.Various reactions using monosaccharides are
known. As such a reaction which is used industrially, 
there is a reaction which comprises isomerizing glucose
(grape sugar) (an aldohexose) into fructose (fruit
sugar) (a corresponding ketohexose) to produce a high-fructose
syrup.Said high-fructose syrup is a mixture of glucose
and fructose, obtained by isomerizing glucose partially.
Owing to the partial isomerization of glucose (having
low sweetness) into fructose (having high sweetness),
the high-fructose syrup has sweetness similar to that of
sucrose.About 70% of the high-fructose syrup is used in
cooling drinks and other drinks because fructose contained
therein has higher sweetness at lower temperatures,
and the other portion is used in general foodstuffs
as a sweetener. The yearly production of high-fructose
syrup in the world is estimated at about 8,000,000 kg.Both glucose and fructose are hexoses similar in
structure. Chemical and enzymatic processes have hitherto
been proposed for isomerization of glucose into
fructose, and it is currently conducted in industry
