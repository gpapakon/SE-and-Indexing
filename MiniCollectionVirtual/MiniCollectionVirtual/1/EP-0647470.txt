<ABSTRACT>
An adsorbent is provided, by which 
β₂-microglobulin accumulated in the body fluid in patients 

having renal insufficiency or patients having malignant 
tumors may be removed safely and effectively, while 

preventing accidents such as coagulation of blood, clogging 
of apparatus, etc. 
The adsorbent for β₂-microglobulin is 
obtained by forming a copolymer composed of neutral amino 

acid residues, acidic amino acid ester residues and urethane 
residues into fibers, followed by subjecting the resulting 

fibers to partial hydrolysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adsorbent useful for 
selectively adsorbing and removing a protein, β₂-microglobulin, 
which causes carpal tunnel syndrome, 
arthropathy, etc., from body fluid such as blood, ascites, 
fluid in the thoracic cavity, etc. It has been clarified that large amounts of the protein 
β₂-microglobulin, complexes composed of said protein and 
other protein(s), and proteins derived from said protein by 
modifying a part of its amino acid sequence ("β₂-microglobulin" 
as referred to herein includes all of these 
proteins), which cause carpal tunnel syndrome, amyloidosis, 
arthropathy, osteopathy, etc., accumulate in the body fluid, 
such as blood, ascites, fluid in the thoracic cavity, etc., 
in patients having renal insufficiency or patients having 
malignant tumors, and such patients are increasing in these 
days. β₂-microglobulin is a protein having a molecular weight 
of about 11,600, which causes various problems since it is 
hardly removed by conventional blood filtration or dialytic 
filtration, though needing a large amount of a complemental  
 
fluid, and since, if the efficiency of removing it by such 
conventional means is attempted to be elevated, other useful 
proteins are removed simultaneously. Therefore, various polymer adsorbents useful for 
selectively adsorbing and removing β₂-microglobulin were 
developed (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application Nos. 
62-204761, 62-240068, 62-261367, 2-045065). In addition, as adsorbents having improved selective 
adsorbability, those based on a polyamino acid having 
a porous surface were developed (see Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Application Nos. 2-209155, 4-026422, 4-247235, 
4-256441). However, since these are in the form of beads, the 
adsorbent beads will flow into the blood vessel of a patient 
who is subjected to hemodialysis and their frequent use may 
clog the blood vessel. In addition, the apparatus for removing 
β₂-microglobulin using adsorbent beads must be fitted 
with a column having a micro-porous filter by which the beads 
are prevented from flowing out of the column. When whole 
blood is passed through the column, it will cause such a 
trouble that blood cells clog the filter, causing coagulation 
of the blood. For this reason, it is difficult to apply 
whole blood to the apparatus. Therefore, the use of 
the apparatus is limited to the treatment of only plasma 
that was previously separated from the blood by removing 
blood cells therefrom. However, the system, in 
which blood cells are separated from the
