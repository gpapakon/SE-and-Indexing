<ABSTRACT>
A boot for skiing and the like, and snowboarding in particular, is disclosed. The boot (1) consists of two assemblies with differing features and functions, i.e. a relatively stiff power assembly (2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2F, 5) arranged around the foot in such a way that it centralises forces including those caused, in use, when foot pressure is applied forward or backward, and those exerted to control twisting; and a relatively flexible feel assembly (3A, 3B) which is separate from the power assembly, provides foot comfort and conveys information on the behaviour of the ski or the like to the ankle. Both of said assemblies are secured to a common reference member (5).

<CLAIMS>
Boot (1) adapted for gliding sports, which breaks down into two distinct zones of
different characteristics and roles:


one, constituting a relatively rigid energy circuit (2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G, 5),
distributed with respect to the foot so as to centralize the forces, and especially the taking of

supports during practice of the sport;
the other, constituting a relatively flexible, sensitive circuit (3A, 3B), capable of
ensuring comfort of the foot and transmission of information originating from the gliding

member (4) towards the sensitive zones of the foot;

both circuits being affixed to a common reference clement (5, 5A, 5B),

the common reference element is constituted by a relatively rigid sole (5, 5A, 5B) of
the boot (1) adapted to be connected to the gliding member,

in that the rigid energy circuit comprises, in addition to the sole (5), a shell forming
a shoe (2A) affixed to said sole (5) and comprising a rear stiffener (2B) capable of

enveloping the heel, and a front abutment (2C),

and in that the sensitive circuit is constituted by a flexible liner (3A, 3A1, 3A2, 3A3,
3A) comprising tightening means of the foot and lower leg.
Boot according to claim 1, characterized in that the stiffener (2B, 2B1, 2B2) is
extended towards the ankle and lower leg by a collar (2D, 2D1, 2D2) comprising tightening

means (7) on the latter.
Boot according to claim 2, characterized in that the collar (2D, 2D2) is journalled
(8, 10) at its lower rear portion (a) on a corresponding portion (b) of the stiffener (2B, 2B2).
Boot according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterized in that the collar (2D) is
connected to the shoe (2A) or to the sole (5) at least by one relatively rigid lateral tie rod (2E)

to constitute a front support or a rear support according to the position of the leg with respect
to the gliding member (4). 
Boot according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterized in that the collar (2D) is
connected to the shoe (2A) or to the sole (5) by at least one flexible strap (2F) forming a

bracing wire capable of constituting a rear support in tension.
Boot according to one of claims 2-5, characterized in that the front support is
obtained by an extension (c) of the rear stiffener (2B) of the shoe (2A) enveloping the heel

and extending beyond the journal (8) of the collar (2D) so that the corresponding portion
thereof takes support there in a rear-to-front direction.
Boot according to claim 2, characterized in tat the collar (2D1) is journalled at its

lower portion (d) on two journal axes (9) located on the lateral portions of the rear stiffener
(2B1) of the shoe (2A1) inside the malleoli zone of the foot.
Boot according to claim 7, characterized in that the font and rear supports occur
by means of a retractable linkage (19) of the collar (2D1) to the shoe (2A1).
Boot according to one of claims 2-5, characterized in that the front taking of
support occurs by putting in contact a lower edge (j) of the collar (2D2) on an upper edge (k)

of the shoe (2A2).
Boot according to claim 2, characterized in that the energy circuit also comprises
a taking of support located at the front of the boot, which is constituted by a rigid tongue

(2G) arranged between a front portion (l) of the collar (2D2) and an upper front portion (m)
of the shoe (2A2) forming an abutment, said tongue (2G) cooperating with these portions (l,

m), and being separate from the tightening of the leg and foot.
Boot according to one of the previous claims, characterized in that the flexible
liner (3A, 3A1, 3A2, 3A3) enveloping the foot and lower leg is partially freely covered by

the energy circuit.
Boot according to claim 11, characterized in that the liner is covered at least in
its lower portion by an external protective envelope (3B, 3B1, 3B2, 3B3, 3B4).
Boot according to claim 12, characterized in that the liner (3A2) as well as the
external protective envelope (3B2) are connected simultaneously to an upper peripheral edge 

(n) of the shoe (2A2) by means of a stitch (11).
Boot according to claim 12, characterized in that the liner (3A3) is previously
assembled by any linkage means (12), such as stitching or adhesion, to a lower zone (o) of

the protective envelope (3B3) and possibly an insole (13), the sub-assembly thus obtained
then receiving the sole (5A) by direct injection of a plastic material constituting a duplicate

molding.
Boot according to claim 12, characterized in that the protective external envelope
(3B4) is connected to an upper peripheral edge (p) of the shoe (2A2) forming a shell by

means of a stitch (14), whereas the liner (3A4), with or without internal tightening, is fixed
mechanically inside the shoe (2A2) in its zone forming the sole (5A), for

example by glying or screming.
