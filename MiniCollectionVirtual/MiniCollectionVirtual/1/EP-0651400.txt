<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bushing (feedthrough) for connecting an electrical apparatus, which is insulated by gas, to a connection point (5) which is located in atmospheric air, has at least one field control electrode (23,33) (which is arranged coaxially about at least one bushing conductor) at that end of the bushing conductor which faces the region of the bushing carrying potential, and has an insulating tube (25,35) which is assigned to each field control electrode and is arranged coaxially with respect to the bushing conductor. The bushing is distinguished by the fact that the one or more field control electrodes (23,33) are designed as tubes and the one or more insulating tubes (25,35) are connected to that end of the associated control electrode which is on the earth potential side, and are connected to this control electrode via a conductive clamping-in element (24,34).
