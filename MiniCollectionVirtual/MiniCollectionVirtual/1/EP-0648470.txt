<ABSTRACT>
A device for positioning a surgical instrument having 
an elongated portion (18) the device comprising a housing (12) 

having an opening (19) therethrough to receive the elongated 
instrument portion (18) and an actuation member (14) mounted to 

said housing (12) and movable between a first position and a 
second position. The actuation member (14) overlaps a portion 

of said opening (19) in said second position to prevent movement 
of the elongated portion (18) of the instrument. The actuation 

member (14) may be movable along a plane parallel, perpendicular 
or lateral to a longitudinal axis of the surgical 

instrument.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a trocar including a device for
positioning a surgical instrument, and more particularly to a
device for locking the position of a surgical instrument
during an endoscopic surgical procedure. Such a trocar is
disclosed in US-A-5171245.In endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures, surgery is
performed through a small incision in the patient's body. The
incision provides access for a trocar or cannula device which
allows insertion of various surgical instruments including,
for example, retractors, scissors, and clip appliers. In some
surgical procedures, the surgical instrument is inserted
directly through the small incision and into the body cavity.
During endoscopic and other surgical procedures, it is often
desired or necessary to lock the position of such a surgical
instrument positioned in a body cavity. While several devices
have been proposed for locking the position of a trocar or
cannula device few instruments exist which are configured for
locking the position of a surgical instrument inserted either
through a trocar or cannula device, or directly through the
incision itself.One example of a device for locking the position or
supporting a trocar is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,073,169
and includes a membrane having an aperture for receiving the
trocar, an outer flange portion and a bellows-like portion
positioned therebetween. The membrane of this device is
adhered to the body and forms a substantially tight fit and
seal with the trocar. A cannula skirt for immobilizing a 
cannula or sheath inserted into a body during a laparoscopic
surgical procedure is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,137,520.
In this device a torsional spring may be attached to the skirt
around the skirt stem and adjusted to increase friction
between the cannula and skirt to lock the cannula. Another
device for positioning a trocar is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 5,217,441 and includes an inner housing which receives the
trocar cannula and threadably engages an outer housing.
Rotation of the inner housing causes gripping fingers
positioned thereon to be cammed by a surface on the outer
housing thereby locking the position of the trocar cannula.Notwithstanding the foregoing disclosures, there
presently exists a need for a surgical hand instrument locking
device which provides convenient, reliable locking or
positioning of such an instrument during an endoscopic
surgical procedure. The present invention provides such a
device for locking the position of a surgical instrument.According to the present
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A trocar which includes a housing having a passageway
therethrough for receiving an elongate portion of a

surgical instrument and a device (200) for positioning
the surgical instrument relative to the trocar, the

device comprising:

a retaining mechanism to engage with the surgical
instrument, the surgical instrument being positionable at

least partially inside the trocar;

wherein the retaining mechanism is movable between a
first position and a second position to engage the

instrument and secure the instrument relative to the
trocar;

the trocar being characterised in that:
said retaining mechanism includes a first (202) and
a second (204) leg pivotally connected (206) at a first

end and movable between the first and second positions, a
biasing member (220) mounted to said first and second

legs, said biasing member biasing said legs relative to
each other, an aperture positioned between said first and

second legs, said aperture receiving a portion of the
surgical instrument, each of the first and second legs

having a respective engagement portion (226, 227)
associated with said aperture with a clamping surface

(224, 246) for frictionally engaging a portion of said
instrument from opposed sides thereof, to prevent

movement of the instrument portion positioned therein.
A trocar as recited in claim 1, further
comprising a resilient member for biasing said retaining

mechanism. 
A trocar as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein each of the
first and second legs includes a squeeze portion (208).
A trocar as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the
clamping surfaces (224, 226) are faced with a rubber pad

(249).
A trocar as claimed in any one of the preceding claims
wherein the clamping surfaces are V-shaped to engage an

instrument of cylindrical form.
