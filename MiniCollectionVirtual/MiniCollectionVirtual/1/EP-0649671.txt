<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gaming machine chair placed in 
front of a gaming machine and in particular to a gaming machine 
chair in which a player can sit facing the gaming machine in order 
to play a game. In a gaming house containing a large number of gaming 
machines such as Japanese pinball machines (pachinko machines), 
slot machines, and video game machines, a chair is placed in front 
of each of the gaming machines. These chairs can turn, but are 
fixed so that they cannot move from the respective gaming 
machines. The chairs do not have any special function involved in 
the process of playing a game. On the other hand, a gaming machine is provided with an 
operation section for advancing a game play. The operation 
section is normally placed on the front of the gaming machine. To 
play a game, the player must reach with his or her hand to 
perform any necessary operation on the operation section.  By the way, such a conventional gaming machine chair is 
placed in front of a gaming machine only for a purpose of enabling 
a player to sit in the chair. That is, no special consideration is 
given to easy operation, reduced tiredness, etc., from the player's 
point of view. Thus, the player sitting in the conventional gaming 
machine chair must lean forward and reach with his or her hand to 
operate the gaming machine; in these circumstances, operation is 
not easy to perform, the player becomes tired, and erroneous 
operation is prone to occur. Since the spacing between the chair 
and gaming machine is fixed, some players may feel more tired 
depending on their physiques. Further, in a gaming house containing pinball machines, slot 
machines, etc., a number of gaming machines are placed in a row, 
thus chairs are placed in a row in front of the gaming machines; 
players have difficulty concentrating on playing the game. The 
chair, which is independent of the operation of the gaming 
machine, has a structure which has difficulty in providing a sense 
of unity between the player and the playing of the game. A gaming machine chair as shown in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No.Hei 5-31254 is available. However, the chair disclosed 
here is one in which a device for actively removing noise is built 
in, and is not intended for facilitating game play operation. Thus, the conventional chairs do not enable players to play 
games comfortably. It is therefore a first object of the invention to provide a 
gaming machine chair which enables a player to easily operate a 
gaming machine close at hand without
