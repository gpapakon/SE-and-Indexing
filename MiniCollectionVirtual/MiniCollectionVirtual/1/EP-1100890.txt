<DESCRIPTION>
IMPROVED TRANSFORMATION EFFICIENCY IN PHAGE DISPLAY THROUGH MODIFICATION OF A COAT PROTEINFIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to fusion proteins of a polypeptide and a coat protein of a virus, where a coat protein is not a wild type coat protein. The invention also relates to replicable expression vectors which contain a gene encoding the fusion protein, host cells containing the expression vectors, a virus which displays the fusion protein on the surface of the virus, libraries of the virus displaying a plurality of different fusion proteins on viral surfaces and methods of using these compositions.The invention also relates to a method of transforming cells by electroporating cells to improve transformation efficiency. In various preferred embodiments, the transformation is performed in the presence of a high concentration of DNA; in the presence of a high concentration of cells; with highly purified DNA; with specific host cells; or with combinations of these. When used to prepare libraries, for example phage display libraπes, these improvements allow for the construction of larger libraries in a single electroporation step than has been previously possible. The invention is also directed to a method of producing a product polypeptide by transforming host cells using the method of the invention.DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROUNDBacteriophage (phage) display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to the coat protein on the surface of bacteriophage particles (Scott, J.K. and Smith, G. P. (1990) Science 249: 386). The utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of selectively randomized protein vanants (or randomly cloned cDNAs) can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide (Cwirla, S. E. et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:6378) or protein (Lowman, H.B. et al. (1991) Biochemistry, 30:10832; Clackson, T. et al. (1991) Nature, 352: 624; Marks, J. D. et al. (1991), J. Mol. Biol., 222:581; Kang, A.S. et al. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88:8363) libraries on phage have been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties (Smith, G. P. (1991) Current Opin. Biotechnol., 2:668). Sorting phage libraries of random mutants requires a strategy for constructing and propagating a large number of variants, a procedure for affinity purification using the target receptor, and a means of evaluating the results of binding
