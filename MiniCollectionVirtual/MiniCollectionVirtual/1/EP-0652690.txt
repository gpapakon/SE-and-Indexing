<ABSTRACT>
Automatic control device (5) for lighting, which regulates the lighting of a room by taking a plurality (15) of lighting measurements and by combining together the said measurements in order to control the lighting sources (S1 - S3) individually. It is possible to take account of pluralities of internal lighting measurements (I1 -I4) and pluralities of external lighting measurements (E1 - E4). The device may take account of predictive measurements of external lighting. The said pluralities are delivered by a measuring unit (10) containing a plurality of photosensitive sensors (photodetectors) (C1- C4). The processing is carried out by a fuzzy logic unit (20) and/or a neural network. The behaviours of the user and/or the particular features of the room may be taken into account. Application: Lighting.

<CLAIMS>
A device (5) for automatic control of lighting comprising means (10) for
measuring the illumination of premises (50) and means (20) for setting lighting sources (S1,

S2), distributed within the premises, on the basis of the illumination measurements,
characterized in that the means for measuring illumination comprise a measuring unit (10)

which delivers a plurality (15) of measurements of internal illumination which are carried
out selectively in various orientations (I1-I4), the setting means (20) processing, by

combining them, the plurality (15) of measurements so as to deliver an individual setting
command (25
1
, 25
2
, 25
3
) to each respective light source.
A device as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the setting means are
such that they effect the settings of the said sources by combining the said plurality (15)

with earlier pluralities of illumination measurements.
A device as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the setting means are
such that they store specified which are settings grouped in usage classes, the setting means

being able to receive at least one request to activate the specified settings of a usage class.
A device as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that a first request is a
signal (22) of pattern of behaviour which characterizes the user, the first request delivering

first specified settings.
A device as claimed in to Claim 4, characterized in that it comprises
recognition means (19) which determine the signal (22) of pattern of behaviour by scanning

the plurality (15a) of measurements of internal illumination upon completion of settings
prescribed by the user during a recognition period.
A device as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that a second request is
an activity signal characterizing the usage of the premises, the second request delivering

second specified settings.
A device as claimed in Claims 4 or 5 and 6, characterized in that the setting
means (20) combine the first request and the second request in accordance with fuzzy logic

inference rules so as to obtain settings different from said first settings and from said
second settings. 
A device as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it
comprises an additional unit (10b) for measuring illumination which delivers an additional

plurality (15b) of measurements of illumination external to the premises, which
measurements are carried out selectively in various additional orientations (E1-E4), the

setting means (20) operating by combining said plurality of measurements and said
additional plurality of measurements.
A device as claimed in Claim 8, characterized in that the setting means (20)
comprise prediction means (17) which process the additional plurality (15b) of

measurements of external illumination delivered at a given instant so as to calculate a
prediction (15c) of said additional plurality for a later time, the setting means (20) also

operating with said prediction so as to set the light sources.
A device as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the
setting means are provided with inputs (52,55) for receiving atmospheric data and/or

temporal data which is aggregated with said combined processing.
A device as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the
measuring unit (10) comprises a group of photosensitive sensors (C1-C4) and means

(11,12) for limiting the light flux arriving at each sensor to a beam of small aperture.
A device as claimed in Claim 11, characterized in that the means for limiting
comprise a closed box (11) which is intended to accommodate the group of sensors and is

provided with an aperture (12) of small diameter such that the sensors receive, through the
said aperture, respective partial light beams of different orientation.
A device as claimed in Claim 11 or 12, characterized in that each sensor
comprises a pair of sub-sensors provided with different light filters.
A lighting system for controlling the lighting conditions in premises (50)
with lighting sources (S1,S2) distributed within the premises, characterized in that it

comprises a device (5) for automatic control of lighting as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to
13.
