<ABSTRACT>
Process for the removal of aluminium ions from aqueous liquids, 100 l of the aqueous liquid being treated with 5 to 2500 g of a polymer which contains 50 to 99.5 % by weight of at least one basic vinyl heterocycle having a pKa of at least 3.8 and 0 to 49.5 % by weight of another copolymerizable monomer copolymerized therein and which polymer was prepared in the absence of oxygen and polymerisation initiators and in the presence of 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the monomers, of a crosslinker.

<CLAIMS>
A process for removing aluminum ions from beverages, which
comprises treating the beverage with from 5 to 2500 g per

100 l of a polymer which contains, copolymerized, from 50 to
99.5 % by weight of at least one basic vinyl heterocycle having

a pk
a
 of at least 3.8 and from 0 to 49.5 % by weight of
another copolymerizable monomer and which was prepared in the

absence of oxygen and polymerization initiators and in the
presence of from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the monomers,

of a crosslinker.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a polymer is used
which contains, copolymerised, as basic vinyl heterocycle,

N-vinylimidazole or 2-methyl-1-vinylimidazole or a mixture of
both.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a polymer is
used which contains, copolymerized, as comonomer, exclusively

N-vinylpyrrolidone or N-vinylcaprolactam or a mixture of
both.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, wherein a polymer
is use
d which contains, copolymerized, as crosslinker,
N,N'-divinylethyleneurea.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a polymer
is used which was prepared in the presence of a reducing

agent. 
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein a polymer
is used which was prepared in the presence of water at

from 30 to 150°C.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, wherein a polymer
is used which was prepared without a solvent at from 100

to 200°C.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the
beverage used is beer or fruit juice.
A process as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, wherein the
polymer used is a component of a filter sheet or membrane.
