<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for washing and disinfecting endoscopes comprises a housing (4) defining a chamber and a re-entrant lid (2) designed to be covered by disinfectant when the chamber is filled with disinfectant. Pipework connects disinfectant containers (A-E) to the chamber and an ultraviolet steriliser (8) is disposed in the pipework. Valves (V1-V14) are also disposed in the pipework to control the flow of liquid therethrough and sealable quick release connectors (24-26) connect the pipework to hot (H) and cold (C) water supplies and a drain (D). When released, the apparatus is sealed from external connectors. The apparatus enables the whole system including the chamber containing the endoscopes to be disinfected in an efficient and reliable manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS FOR AND METHOD OF DISINFECTIONThe present invention relates to apparatus for and a method of disinfecting.The invention is particularly, but not exclusively, intended for the disinfection of endoscopes. Disinfection in endoscopy is likely to assume increasing importance in view of the HIV epidemic and the increasing numbers of immune suppressed patients being investigated. Routine sterilization is not possible with endoscopes because of the delicate nature of the instrument, (i.e. lenses, controls etc.) At present endoscopes are sterilized using a combination of mechanical cleaning and soaking in the preferred disinfectant (2% Glutaraldehyde) . Unfortunately this disinfectant is an irritant and is known to cause side effects in many staff. One solution is to use a sealed washing machine with an automatic cycle. A recent evaluation of four commercially available machines, however, has identified serious flaws in the wash cycle. In particular it was found that the machines could become colonised and transmit infection to the patient via the endoscope. The problem of colonisation arises from two problems. The first is that the lid of the enclosure containing the endoscopes is not adequately disinfected resulting in potentially contaminated water dripping onto the sterilised -instrument after its 

disinfection. Secondly, not all pipework is adequately disinfected leaving potential areas for bacterial colonisation. During rinse cycles these bacteria can infect the disinfected instrument. The current invention addresses these problems and also minimises the exposure of staff operating the machine to the disinfectant.According to the invention there is provided apparatus for washing and disinfecting comprising a housing defining a chamber for accommodating items to be washed and disinfected characterised by a lid operative to close off the chamber and shaped so that when the chamber is filled with disinfectant the inside surface of the lid is completely covered by disinfectant, pipework operative to connect supplies of disinfectant to the chamber, a bacterial filter disposed in the pipework and valves disposed in the pipework and controlling the flow of disinfectant therethrough.In order that the invention may be more clearly understood, one embodiment thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-Figure 1 diagrammatically shows apparatus for disinfection for use with endoscopes .

 CLAIMS
1. Apparatus for washing and disinfecting comprising a housing (4) defining a chamber for accommodating items to be washed and disinfected characterised by a lid (2) operative to close off the chamber and shaped so that when the chamber is filled with disinfectant the inside surface of the lid is completely covered by disinfectant, pipework operative to connect supplies of disinfectant to the chamber, a bacterial filter disposed in the pipework and valves (VI to V8) disposed in the pipework and controlling the flow of disinfectant therethrough.
2. Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, in which means (24, 25, 26) are provided for connecting the pipework to hot and cold water supplies and to a drain.
3. Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, in which the means for connecting comprises quick release connectors (24, 25,26) operative to seal the corresponding pipe on release.
4. Apparatus as claimed in claim 3, in which each quick release connector (24, 25, 26) comprises an automatic closure valve operative to automatically close on release. 


5. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the bacterial filter (8) comprises an ultra violet steriliser.
6. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the lid (2) has a re-entrant form.
7. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which pump means are provided for circulating fluid through the pipework.
8. Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim, in which means are provided for sensing the temperature of fluid in the pipework.
