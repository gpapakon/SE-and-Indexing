<ABSTRACT>
A sealing arrangement for a preferably frameless window pane of a motor vehicle is held in position on a lateral roof frame by means of screws and comprises a sealing body, which is composed of a holding portion and a profile portion which interacts with the window pane. In order to provide a sealing arrangement which is of simple construction and can be secured and adjusted on the roof frame in a rapid and easy-to-fit manner, it is provided that the sealing body is secured directly on the roof frame by means of screws without the interconnection of an additional holding element, the profile portion interacting with the sealing body via a releasable snap connection and for the fitting of the screws the profile portion assuming a downwardly directed release position.

<CLAIMS>
A sealing device (10, 10') for a preferably frameless window pane of a motor vehicle, 
held in position on a lateral roof frame (11) opposite thereto by means of screws (17) and 

provided with a sealing member (13, 13') which comprises a retaining portion (14, 14') 
extending adjacent to the roof frame (11) and a sectioned portion (15, 15') bounding at 

least one cavity (16, 16') and cooperating with the window pane (6), 
characterized in 
that
 the sealing member (13, 13') is secured directly to the roof frame (11) by means of 
screws (17) without the interposition of an additional retaining member, wherein the 

sectioned portion (15, 15') cooperating with the window pane (6) occupies a release 
position 
C
 directed downwards for the insertion and tightening of the screw (17), and the 
sectioned portion (15, 15') can be releasably connected to the sealing member (13, 13') 

by way of a snap fastening (18, 18'). 
A sealing device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a reinforcement inlay (19, 
19') is provided in the retaining portion (14, 14') facing the roof frame (11). 
A sealing device according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 the reinforcement 
inlay (19, 19') connected to the retaining portion (14, 14') or embedded therein has a substantially 

U-shaped section. 
A sealing device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a first external arm (22, 
22') of the reinforcement inlay (19, 19') is orientated substantially parallel to the plane 


A-A
 of the window pane (6), wherein the said arm (22, 22') or the covering (23) thereof 
projects downwards by an amount 
B
 beyond the window pane (6). 
A sealing device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the second 
arm (24, 24') of the reinforcement inlay (19, 19') is orientated substantially at a right 

angle to the roof frame (11), and the releasable snap fastening (18, 18') is provided in the 
region of the second arm (24, 24'). 
A sealing device according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the sectioned portion 
(15) can be releasably connected to the retaining portion (14) of the sealing member (13) 

by way of the snap fastening (18). 
A sealing device according to Claims 1 and 6, 
characterized in that
 the snap fastening  
 

(18) comprises a barb-shaped member (25) which cooperates with a corresponding 
undercut receiving means (26). 
A sealing device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the barb-shaped member 
(25) is formed on the retaining portion (14) and the re
ceiving means (26) is formed on 
the sectioned portion (15) of the sealing member (13). 
A sealing device according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in 
that
 in the region of a washer (21) for the screw (17) the reinforcement inlay (19) has no 
covering locally, so that the washer (21) rests directly on the reinforcement inlay (19). 
A sealing device according to one or more of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in 
that
 the sectioned portion (15') can be releasably connected to the reinforcement inlay 
(19') of the sealing member (13') by way of the snap fastening (18'). 
A sealing device according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the snap fastening (18') is 
formed by an undercut receiving means (26') arranged on the sectioned portion (15') and 

by a barb-shaped member (25') provided on the reinforcement inlay (19'), wherein the 
member (25') is provided in the region of the free, downwardly directed end of the arm 

(24') and is formed by a cross-sectional widening (34) of the arm (24').
