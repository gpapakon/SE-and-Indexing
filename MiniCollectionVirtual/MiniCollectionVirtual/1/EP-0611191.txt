<ABSTRACT>
A machine (1) for milling, drilling, planing (surfacing), profiling and polishing stones or similar material includes a carriage (saddle, slide) (4) which can move in terms of translation in a direction (B). The carriage (4) is supported by a chassis (2) simultaneously supporting the carriage (4) and a receiving bed (3) which can be moved in terms of translation in another direction (A) substantially perpendicular to the direction (B) of motion of the carriage (4).

Machine for milling, drilling, surfacing, moulding and
polishing stones or similar material, of the type comprising a

cradle (4) capable of parallel translation, said cradle
receiving an arm (20) articulated around a vertical axis, said

arm hearing a machining device (27) which is adjustable in
position and is pivoted around a horizontal axis in order to

machine stones or similar material flange-mounted on a support
by a fastening system, characterised in that the machine

comprises a base frame (2) simultaneously supporting said
cradle and said support, said support being a supporting table

capable of parallel translation in a first direction (A), said
cradle being capable of parallel translation, in a second

direction (B) along a beam (5) of the base frame, and the two
directions of parallel translation being essentially

perpendicular to one another, whereby the supporting table is
provided with a plurality of apertures (40) capable of

receiving sliding flange members (46); that each aperture has
an essentially constant width and an end which is wider than

said width to permit the engagement and retention of bushes
(43) in the form of drilled spools; that the flange members are

mounted to slide through the bushes.
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the flange
members (46) are mounted so as to be enclosed in the bushes by

means of pins (48) or similar means.
Machine according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that each
aperture (40) has an essentially constant width (l) and one end

(40a) which is wider than said width (l) to permit the
engagement of bushes (43) in the form of drilled spools through

said wider end (40a) and the retention of these bushes (43)
along said essentially constant width.
Machine according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the
dimensions relating to the apertures (40), bushes (43) and 

flange members (46) are predetermined in order to achieve
simultaneous wedging of a bush (43) in an aperture (40) and a

flange member (46) in a bush (43) upon application of a wedging
force on this flange member (46).
Machine according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the upper face (41) of the supporting

table is made of a rubber- or elastomer-type damping material,
and that the wedging of the flange members (46) is conducted

through two successive contact surfaces (40-43, 43-46) in order
to damp any internal vibration at the base frame (2) and to

prevent any cracking or deterioration in the stones (P).
Machine according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
machining device (27) is connected to the main section of the

arm (20) by a translation means (21) in a third direction (C)
of parallel translation, said third direction (C) being

essentially vertical and orthogonal to the first direction (A)
and second direction (B) of parallel translation.
Machine according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
machining device (27) comprises, on the one hand, a swing-out

plate (30) integral to the means (26) for position adjustment
capable of pivoting around a horizontal axis (28) and, on the

other hand, a machining assembly bearing a motor (32) and a
drive shaft (35) for a tool, and said machining assembly can be

swinged out by pivoting around an axis (31) perpendicular to said
swing-out plate (30).
Machine according to one of the preceding claims, characterised
in that the machine (1) comprises three degrees of freedom of

parallel translation (A,B,C) and three degrees of freedom of rotational
motion around three axes (14, 28, 31), a first axis (14) being

essentially vertical and a second axis (28) being essentially
horizontal.
