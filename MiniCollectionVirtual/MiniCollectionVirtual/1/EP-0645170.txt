<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a filter insert is proposed. The filter insert comprises a filter medium folded in a zigzag shape. In a first working step, folding edges are stamped onto the filter medium. Then at least two glue beads are applied onto the surface of the filter medium by glue application devices which are furnished with glue application nozzles and then the folding is carried out. According to the invention at least one of the glue application devices is movable transversely to the direction of transport of the filter medium.

Method of producing a plate-like filter insert, comprising a filter
means which is folded in a zigzag-like manner, wherein, in a first

operational step, bent edges are initially stamped, then at least two glue
beads are applied to the surface of the filter means by glue applicators,

which are provided with glue applying nozzles, and thereafter the folding
is effected, characterised in that at least one of the glue applicators (21) is

provided with two glue applying nozzles (27, 28, 29, 30), which are
moved transversely relative to the direction of conveyance of the filter

material (20), whereby two glue beads (34, 35), which extend in a parallel
manner, are produced, while the filter material (20) is moved along the

direction of conveyance, and in that a cutting apparatus (37) is provided,
which divides the folded filter material (20) into individual filter elements,

and in that, furthermore, a separating cut is effected with an additional
cutting apparatus between the glue beads (34, 35) which extend in a

parallel manner, the glue beads producing the lateral seals.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the glue
applicator (21) is provided with a carrier head (26), which has a first glue

applying nozzle (29), an additional glue applying nozzle (30) being
provided on the carrier head (26), and, in consequence, the two glue beads

(34, 35) are produced, which extend in a parallel manner.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that the glue applying
nozzles (29, 30) are disposed in an offset manner relative to each other

when viewed with respect to the direction of conveyance. 
Method according to one of the previous claims, characterised in
that at least one additional glue applicator (22) is provided, said applicator

having a carrier head (25) which is displaceable transversely relative to the
direction of conveyance, on which carrier head two glue applying nozzles

(27, 28) are disposed, and said glue applicator is disposed in an offset
manner relative to the first glue applicator (21) when viewed with respect

to the direction of conveyance.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that the additional
glue applicator (22) returns to its initial position during the application of

glue beads by means of a glue applicator (21).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the cutting
apparatus (37) effects a cutting movement transversely relative to the

direction of conveyance of the filter means, the control signal for the
cutting operation being actuated via a sensor (42).
Method according to claim 6, characterised in that the sensor (42)
senses the actual end of the glue bead or the start of the glue bead, or a

measurement point (41) disposed on the filter means.
Method according to one of the previous claims, characterised in
that a fold regulator (36) generates the signals for controlling the glue

applicators (21, 22) and the glue applying nozzles (27 - 30). 
Method according to one of the previous claims, characterised in
that the glue applicators (21, 22) are disposed so as to be displaceable in

the direction of conveyance.
Method according to one of the previous claims, characterised in
that the filter insert (38, 39) is cut to size after the applied glue has

hardened along the glue bead.
Filter insert, comprising a filter material (20) which is folded in a
zigzag-like manner, an end-face seal being provided via glue beads on the

end faces extending transversely relative to the folding, characterised in
that at least one or some of the end faces (14) extend at an angle other than

90Â° relative to the fold alignment.
Filter according to claim 11, characterised in that, to utilise any
desirable housing constructions, the filter material (20) which is folded in a

zigzag-like manner has a cross-section deviating from simple geometric
configurations.
