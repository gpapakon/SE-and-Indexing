<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer ink composition using a basic dye (cationic dye). The composition contains a basic dye 
and an organic polymer, and the basic dye is dispersed or dissolved in the organic polymer with a solubilizer having 

compatibility with both the dye and the polymer. The solubilizer is an amphipathic compound, and preferably has an 
HLB value of at least 7. When an ink layer containing this composition is formed on a support member, a thermal 

transfer ink ribbon is obtained. A sheet for thermal transfer used has an acceptor layer containing an interlayer 
compound substituted by an ion exchangeable with the basic dye and a binder resin. The ion exchangeable with the 

basic dye may consist of an organic ion, such as an organic onium ion. The ink layer of the thermal transfer ink 
ribbon and the acceptor layer of the sheet for thermal transfer are laminated face-to-face, and this laminate is heated 

to transfer the basic dye contained in the ink layer to the acceptor layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an ink composition for thermal
transfer, an ink ribbon for thermal transfer
and a thermal transfer method which are preferably
adapted for an ink ribbon and a printing paper for a video
printer.A recent video printer forms an image by using an ink ribbon
produced by dissolving a disperse dye into a hydrophobic high
polymer and thermally transferring the dye contained in the ink
ribbon onto a receptor layer applied on a transfer target
material, such as synthetic paper, in accordance with image
signals.The disperse dye is employed herein for the following
reason. Since the disperse dye is hydrophobic, it exhibits
satisfactory dyeing property on the transfer target material and
hence practical sensitivity on transfer.However, when the disperse dye is used as the dye for the
ink ribbon, it is difficult to assure fixation after printing.Meanwhile, a basic dye, or a so-called cationic dye, having
high visibility and coloring property peculiar to the basic 
material is known as a dye for dyeing acrylic fibers. It is
proposed to use the cationic dye as a dye for the ink ribbon,
as disclosed in the US Patent No. 4,664,671.The cationic dye is known to exhibit excellent light
fastness and wet coloring fastness on the acrylic substrate.
However, since the cationic dye has hydrophilic property, it is
difficult to disperse the cationic dye uniformly and stably into
the hydrophobic high polymer, such as butyral resin, which is
broadly used as a binder for the ink ribbon. In addition, there
is no measure to fix the image in or after image formation.To solve such problems, the present Applicant has proposed
a technique of using a hydrophobic cationic dye for the ink
ribbon while using an interlayer compound ion-exchangeable with
the cationic dye and dissolved into a binder high polymer for the
receptor layer of the printing paper, and then holding and fixing
in the interlayer compound the cationic dye transferred into the
receptor layer, in the JP Patent Kokai Publication No. 4-299183.With this technique, however, it is necessary to make the
cationic dye hydrophobic in advance by ion exchange using an
organic anionic surface active agent. Thus, the production
process of the ink composition and the ink ribbon is complex.Thus, it is an object of the present invention to cause the
basic dye, which has been unusable as an image forming material
of the thermal transfer system, to be adaptable without 
accompanying complexity of the production process. It is another
object of the present invention
