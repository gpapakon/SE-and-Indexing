<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for administration by 
inhalation, more particularly to non-pressurised powder compositions. Many medicaments, especially those for the treatment of diseases of the 
respiratory tract, are administered by inhalation. However, some medicaments, such 
as reproterol hydrochloride, have an undesirable taste when administered by 
inhalation, this being due to that proportion of medicament which is deposited in the 
mouth and throat of the patient. Thus, it would be desirable to modify the taste of 
inhalation compositions by incorporating a flavouring agent, as this may result in 
improved patient compliance especially if the patients are young children. Medicaments for inhalation are commonly administered in the form of 
powders, either from pressurised canisters containing the powder in admixture with a 
liquefied gas aerosol propellant, or as non-pressurised dry powder compositions. In the former case it is known to include flavouring and/or sweetening agents 
in the composition to improve the taste of the composition and/or to give the 
composition a recognisable flavour so that the patient realises when a dose has been 
inhaled, as disclosed in EP-A-365119. However, such compositions suffer from the 
disadvantage that the propellant may comprise a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) which is 
thought to be harmful to the environment generally and the ozone layer in particular. 
Furthermore the flavouring agent may be inhaled into the lung. It would be desirable to incorporate flavouring agents into non-pressurised 
dry powder pharmaceutical compositions. However, flavouring agents usually exist as 
oils or sticky solids at room temperature. This renders them unsuitable for use in dry 
powder formulations, for example, because they have poor flow properties and could 
cause the powdered medicament to agglomerate thus reducing dispersion to the lung. We now provide a pharmaceutical inhalation composition which overcomes 
or substantially mitigates these disadvantages. We have now found that by entrapping the flavouring agent in a 
polysaccharide, the flavouring agent may be kept sufficiently free flowing to be 
incorporated into non-pressurised powder inhalation compositions. Thus, according to the invention, we provide a non-pressurised 
pharmaceutical inhalation composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount 
of a particulate inhalation medicament having a mass median diameter in the range  
 
0.01 to 15 µm and a particulate polysaccharide entrapped
