<ABSTRACT>
1. In a target for magnetron sputtering apparatus of a cobalt-based alloy containing further elements in concentrations so that intermetallic phases are formed with at least one of these elements and intermetallic phases are observed in the equilibrium state at the operating temperature of the target because of the phase diagram, the grain boundaries, subgrain boundaries or slip bands of the cobalt solid solution forming the matrix are dressed with the elements forming the intermetallic phases, with the reflections in the X-ray diffraction pattern of the target showing an intermetallic phase which is essentially absent in the cast state and only forms on ignition in the temperature range below the solidus temperature of the alloy by a solid-state reaction.

predominantly hexagonal cobalt mixed crystals and

intermetallic phases formed with R, wherein the target
material exhibits at least one of the following two

features:

grain boundaries or slip bands of the cobalt

mixed crystal constituting the matrix are
decorated with the elements constituting the

intermetallic phases.
b) X-ray diffractograms produced from the target
exhibit reflections of an intermetallic phase

which is substantially absent in the cast state
and is only formed by a solid-state reaction on

annealing within a temperature range below the
solidus temperature of the alloy.
