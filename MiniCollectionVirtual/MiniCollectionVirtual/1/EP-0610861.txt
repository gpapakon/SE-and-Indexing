<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel fluorine-containing 
benzophenone derivatives and their use as 
ultraviolet absorbers. Polymer resin materials commonly used outdoors or 
indoors are exposed to various lights such as sunlight or 
lights of fluorescent lamps. Among them, lights of from 
200 to 400 nm are ultraviolet rays hazardous to the resin 
materials and cause discoloration, color change or 
deterioration such as reduction of strength of the 
materials due to photo decomposition. Further, when such 
a resin material is used for coating a base material, 
even the base material to be protected will be adversely 
affected, since the resin coating does not have adequate 
ultraviolet absorptivity. Heretofore, to protect a resin material or a base 
material coated with a resin material, it has been common 
to incorporate to the resin material an ultraviolet 
absorber such as benzophenone or benzotriazole, or  
 
various colorants depending upon the wavelengths of the 
lights to be absorbed. It is known that such compounds 
are capable of absorbing lights in the ultraviolet region 
and thus will be excited by ultraviolet rays, but the 
energy under excitation is converted within the molecules 
to a heat energy which is non-hazardous to the resin 
material, whereby deterioration of the resin material can 
be prevented. Such an ultraviolet absorber is coated on the surface 
of the material or kneaded into the material itself at 
the time of molding the resin, to impart the ultraviolet 
absorptivity to the resin. When it is used as kneaded 
into a resin, however, there has been a problem such that 
its heat resistance at the molding temperature of the 
resin is poor, or when the resin is used in a severe 
environment for a long period of time, the compound tends 
to gradually bleedout of the resin. For the purpose of 
solving such a problem, it has been attempted to increase 
the vapor pressure of the ultraviolet absorber itself by 
introducing alkyl groups such as methyl groups, octyl 
groups or t-butyl groups to the structure of the 
ultraviolet absorber, or to make the ultraviolet absorber 
a polymer by introducing polymerizable moieties such as 
acryl groups, methacryl groups or vinyl groups thereto. However, in view of the environment in which the 
resin material is practically used, or the heating 
temperature at the time of molding, it has still been  
 
desired to develop a high performance ultraviolet 
absorber which has higher heat resistance and lower 
bleedout tendency when incorporated into
