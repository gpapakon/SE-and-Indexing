<ABSTRACT>
This invention inspects non-destructively the mechanical behavior of an article, to which a load is applied, 
on the basis of analysis of spatial and time distribution of elastoplastic deformation and a rotary displacement speed. 

Optical images of the surfaces of an object of inspection are taken as holographic images, and they are superimposed 
in predetermined short intervals of time to obtain a diffraction image. The diffraction image is converted to a wave 

pattern of a spatial and time distribution of deformation and rotary displacement in a predetermined axial direction. 
The resulting distribution is analyzed on the wave theory of plasticity and strength, and the wavelength, amplitude 

and velocity of a mitigation wave of plastic deformation are determined. The timing and place of destruction which 
will occur in future are predicted from these wave parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to methods for testing
materials and structures, and more specifically, to a method
and apparatus for nondestructive testing of objects for
their mechanical behaviors.Known in the art is a method to determine stresses and
strains in a loaded object, wherein the object is
illuminated by coherent laser radiation before and after
loading in order to obtain pairs of superimposed speckle
patterns. These speckle patterns are transformed into a
diffraction pattern, which is then mathematically processed.
Signal amplitudes obtained by this mathematical processing
are used to obtain values of strains and stresses at various
points of an elastically deformed object (e.g., PCT JP
87/07365).The above mentioned method is deficient because it does
not allow kinetics of plastic deformation process to be
analyzed since it is not designed to obtain three
dimensional waves of plastic deformation. The above
mentioned method permits calculation of stress and
distortion fields according to the detected deformation, but
does not allow one to analyze the plastic flow caused by
plastic deformation. Therefore, the above mentioned
conventional method is suitable only for estimation of
elastic deformation and is practically unsuitable for the
region of plastic deformation.Also known in the art is from US-A-4 999 681 a
holographic interferometer for the non-destructive 
examination of test pieces. It uses a single source of
pulses of coherent light both for hologram production and
subsequent reconstruction and combination of wavefronts, but
is primarily concerned with providing means for flicker-free
viewing of interference patterns on a video monitor.Further known in the art is from FR-A-2 274 915 a
method using holographic interferometry for non-destructive
testing for non-uniformities in elastic or visco-elastic
bodies. The method is suitable for series applications for
determining the relaxation or creep behaviour of visco-elastic
specimens under fixed load conditions.Still further known in the art is from Soviet Physics:
Technical Physics, vol. 35, no. 6, June 1990, New York, NY,
pp. 742-744, Article by A.A. Kamshilin et al. a method using
double-exposure holographic interferometry for precise
measurements of small displacements produced by external
forces on plate objects. The method is used for determining
the principal parameters characterizing the elastic
properties of solids, especially to automate the measurement
of Young's modulus.None of the outlined methods is suitable for the
analysis
