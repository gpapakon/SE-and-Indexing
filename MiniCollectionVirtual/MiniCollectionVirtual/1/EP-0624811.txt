<ABSTRACT>
A multifocal contact lens, having a rear surface configured to 
float on a tear film covering the user's cornea, a front surface 

comprised of at least two contiguous surface segments, an upper 
surface segment optically configured to serve for distance vision 

and a lower surface segment optically configured to serve for 
near vision. In at least one peripheral zone of the lens there 

is provided at least one recess constituting a preferred escape 
aperture for parts of the tear film displaced when the contact 

lens slides down the user's cornea, to the effect of 
substantially preventing rotation of the contact lens during lens 

translation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bi- or multifocal contact 
lens. The lens is of the type that is pushed up the cornea by the 
lower eyelid upon downgazing for near vision, and settles back, 
due to gravity, upon looking up for distance vision. This 
translational movement of the lens relative to the pupil is 
necessary in order for the pupil to be located behind the upper 
part of the lens for distance vision, and behind the lower part 
of the lens for near vision. A major problem encountered with these lenses is that of 
stability of their angular orientation, so that after intentional 
translation, or translation caused by involuntary blinking, the 
lens will automatically return to its proper orientation, in 
which the distance-vision half of the lens is indeed the upper 
half and the near-vision half, the lower half, with the border 
line between the two halves in a substantially horizontal 
orientation. In prior art lenses, attempts were made to solve this 
problem by making the lower half of the lens much heavier, as it 
were ballasting it, and also truncating the lower edge of the 
lens. While the general orientation of the moving lens was 
helped by the ballasted lower part, final alignment was left to 
the flat edge portion produced by the truncation, which portion, 
when coming in contact with the lower eyelid, was supposed to 
bring about precise orientation. These lenses, mainly due to their excessive weight and bulk, 
proved to be very uncomfortable and a significant proportion of 
patients could not use them at all, or when wearing them, did not 
derive much benefit from them. US-A-4 211 476 discloses a contact lens provided with an aperture or 
hole in the peripheral portion of the lens. This aperture or hole causes 
local deformation of the tear film such that the resulting surface 
tension forces prevent the lens from rotating.  
 It is one of the objects of the present invention to provide 
a bifocal or multifocal contact lens that, for all practical 
purposes, is not heavier than a conventional monofocal contact 
lens, is comfortable to wear, and provides the translation 
necessary for satisfactory alternating vision. According to the invention, this is achieved by providing a 
multifocal contact lens comprising a near surface configured to 
float on a tear film covering the user's cornea and a front 
surface comprised of at least two contiguous surface segments, an 
upper surface segment optically configured to serve for distance 
vision and a lower surface segment optically

<CLAIMS>
A multifocal contact lens, comprising a rear surface (2) 
configured to float on a tear film covering the user's cornea and 

a front surface (4) comprised of at least two contiguous surface 
segments (6,8), an upper surface segment (6) optically configured to serve 

for distance vision and a lower surface segment (8) optically 
configured to serve for near vision, characterized in that, in at 

least one peripheral zone (10) of said lens there is provided at least 
one recess (16,18) constituting a preferred escape aperture for parts of 

said tear film displaced when said contact lens slides down the 
user's cornea, so as to substantially prevent rotation 

of said contact lens during said sliding, as well as to 
optimize said sliding. 
The contact lens as claimed in claim 1, wherein said at 
least one escape aperture is provided in the peripheral zone of 

said upper surface segment. 
The contact lens as claimed in claim 1, wherein said escape 
aperture is in the form of at least one notch cut in said 

peripheral zone. 
The contact lens as claimed in claim 1, wherein said escape 
aperture is in the form of at least one groove cut in the 

peripheral zone of said rear surface, said groove opening onto 
the edge of said lens. 
The contact lens as claimed in claim 1, wherein, with said 
lens in position of use, the border between said upper surface 

segment and said lower surface segment is defined by the outline 
of said upper surface segment.  

 
The contact lens as claimed in claim 1, wherein, with the 
lens in position of use, a border between said upper surface 

segment and said lower surface segment is located in a 
substantially horizontal plane. 
The contact lens as claimed in claim 6, wherein said border 
is a shoulder-like step produced by said lower surface segment 

projecting, at said border, beyond said upper surface segment. 
The contact lens as claimed in claim 6, wherein, with said 
lens in position of use, the center of gravity of said lens is 

located below the geometrical center of said lens.
