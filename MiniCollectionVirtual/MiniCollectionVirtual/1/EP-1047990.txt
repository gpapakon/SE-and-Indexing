<ABSTRACT>
A computer system for parallel execution of several programs, consisting of a limited resource (R) which is accessed by processes that are to be executed. The inventive system also comprises a first device for calculating utilization of the capacity (C) of limited resource (R), a second device for determining load responsibility (LR) of a process accessing resource (R) and a third device for delaying execution of process (P) accessing resource (R) according to the utilization of capacity (C), critical utilization of capacity (Ccrit) of the resource and load responsibility (LR) of process (P). This prevents a resource with a limited capacity, and therefore the computer system, from becoming blocked.
