<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, the alkoxylation of compounds containing active H atoms is carried out in the presence of specific alkaline earth metal salts of alkyl- or alkenylsuccinic acid monoesters as catalyst. Alkoxylates having a narrow homologue distribution and good appearance are obtained.

A process for the preparation of alkoxylates by 
alkoxylating compounds containing at least one 

active hydrogen atom in the presence of a salt of a 
succinic monoester as catalyst, which comprises 

carrying out the alkoxylation in the presence of at 
least one alkaline earth metal salt of an alkyl- or 

alkenylsuccinic monoester of the formulae (I) and 
(II) below

reacting the succinic monoester compound with an 
oxide, carbonate or hydroxide of barium, calcium or 

strontium in a quantity of from 0.9 to 1.8 mol per 
2 mol of succinic monoester. 
The process as claimed in one ore more of claims 1

acid, sulfuric acid, phosphorous acid or 
phosphoric acid. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 4, wherein the alkoxylation catalyst is present 

in a quantity of from 0.1 to 5 % by weight based on 
the quantity of compound to be alkoxylated. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 5, wherein compounds containing hydroxyl groups 

are alkoxylated using ethylene oxide or propylene 
oxide or a mixture of the two.

The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 
to 7, wherein the alkylene oxide is employed in a 

quantity of from 2 to 15 mol per mole of compound to 
be alkoxylated.
