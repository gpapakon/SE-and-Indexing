<ABSTRACT>
This steering column unit, particularly for a motor vehicle, of the type including a steering shaft (1) mounted so that it can rotate in a column body (2) and means (5) for temporary axial immobilisation of the shaft in the body in order to fit the assembly to the rest of the structure of the vehicle, these means being able to be moved between an active immobilisation position and a retracted position, is characterised in that it includes means (10) for limiting the axial movement of the shaft in the body when the means (5) for temporary axial immobilisation are in the retracted position.

Steering column assembly, for a motor vehicle in 
particular, of the type comprising a steering shaft (1) 

mounted such that it is displaceable rotationally inside a 
column body (2) and means (5;12) of temporary axial 

immobilisation of the shaft in the body, for the fitting of 
the assembly on the rest of the structure of the vehicle, 

which are displaceable between an active immobilisation 
position and a retracted position, characterized in that it 

comprises means (10;12) of limitation of the axial 
displacement of the shaft in the body when the temporary 

axial immobilisation means are in the retracted position. 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the means of limitation of axial displacement of the 

shaft in the body comprise complementary stop surfaces 
(9,10a,10b; 16,17,18) of the shaft and of the body. 
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the complementary stop surfaces of the shaft (1) are 

formed by a collar (9) attached to the shaft and extending 
between the stop surfaces (10a,10b; 17,18) of a 

displacement limitation member (10;12) connected to the 
body (2). 
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the limitation member connected to the body is formed 

by a part (10) fitted into a recess of the latter. 
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the temporary axial immobilisation means comprise an 

immobilisation stud (12) comprising grasping means (13) and 
first stop surfaces (14,15) for the temporary axial 

immobilization of the shaft in the body when it is in the 
active position and second stop surfaces (17,18) for 

limiting the axial displacement of the shaft in the body 
when it is in the retracted position.
