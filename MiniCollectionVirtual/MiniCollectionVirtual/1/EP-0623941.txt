<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of additives to produce polymer electrets with 
improved charge stability. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of Charge 
Control Agents blended with polyolefins or other polymers at concentrations of 0.01-30% 
wt., preferably 0.1.3% wt., to significantly enhance the charge lifetime of said electrets. It is known that certain dielectric materials can be permanently electrostatically 
polarized. These materials are polarized by exciting the material by heating, applying a 
high-voltage electric field, and cooling the material while under the influence of the 
electric field. Upon the removal of the electric field, appropriate dielectric materials will 
be found to have become the electrical equivalent of a permanent magnet. A dielectric 
becomes an electret when the rate of decay of the field-induced polarization can be slowed 
down so much that a significant fraction of the polarization is preserved long after the 
polarizing field has been removed. Such electrets can be created by various methods, e.g. 
corona charging, triboelectric charging (friction), or any other charging technique (e.g. by 
liquid contact). It is known that air filters made of electret fibers are very effective in removing 
submicron aerosols. The electrostatic collection mechanism increases the efficiency of 
these electrostatically charged fibrous non-woven materials relative to conventional, 
uncharged fibers. The filters have increased ability for the mechanical capture of particles 
with no corresponding increase in pressure drop. The use of electets has also been 
investigated in the medical field, i.e., wound healing and blood compatibility, as well as in 
dosimetry, where charged polymer films are used to determine radioactive exposure. Early methods for the formation of fibrous electrets from thermoplastic films or 
filaments involved disposing the thread or filaments in an electrostatic field established  
 
between parallel closed spaced electrodes. (U.S. Patent No. 2,740,184.) Another method 
for forming electrets is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.3,571.679. This method involves a 
process for forming electrets by closely winding a monofilament fiber such as a 
polypropylene fiber on a hollow winding roller which has been previously surfaced with a 
polyamide faced aluminum foil. This process however is discontinuous and extremely 
slow in that charging times of three hours or so for the wrapped roll are required. Now electrets are commonly produced by a number of methods
