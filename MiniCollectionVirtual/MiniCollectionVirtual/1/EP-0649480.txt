<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides for the fabrication of single layer semimetal/semiconductor heterostructures and multilayer semimetal/semiconductor structures. Each semimetal/semiconductor layer fabricated in accordance with the present invention has compatible crystal symmetry across the heterojunction between a semimetal and a semiconductor. A single layer semimetal/semiconductor structure is fabricated by growing a rhombohedral semimetal in a (111) direction on a substrate material having a (111) orientation, and then growing a zincblende semiconductor in a (111) direction on the semimetal. A multilayer semimetal/semiconductor structure may be grown from the single layer semimetal/semiconductor structure by growing an additional rhombohedral semimetal layer in a (111) direction on the preceding semiconductor grown, then growing an additional zincblende semiconductor layer in a (111) direction on the additional semimetal layer, and then repeating this process as many times as desired. Each semimetal to be sandwiched between semiconductors in the multilayer semimetal/semiconductor structure may be grown thin enough that the semimetal is converted into a semiconductor.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SEMIMETAL-SEMICONDUCTOR HETEROSTRUCTURES AND MULTILAYERSField of the InventionThe invention relates to the fabrication of semimetal/semiconductor heterostructures. In particular, the invention relates to the fabrication of one or more combinations of semimetal and semiconductor layers having compatible crystal symmetry across each heterojunction between a given semimetal and the adjoining semiconductor. Any of the semimetal layers sandwiched between semiconductor layers may be grown thin enough that the semimetal layer becomes a semiconductor.Background of the Invention The incorporation of metallic films embedded in a semiconductor device, thereby creating a hybrid structure, has received significant attention. This has primarily been motivated for two reasons: (i) because of the low resistivity of the metals that would enable fabrication of buried contacts, interconnects and ground planes, which are considered essential to the three dimensional integration of semiconductor devices; and (ii) because of the possibility of combining the transport properties of metals and semiconductors to create novel or improved device applications, for example metal base transistors or high frequency switches.Synthesis of metal/semiconductor hybrid structures impose stringent requirements on the film and heterojunction properties. Specifically, the crystalline quality and thermal stability of both the embedded metallic layer and the semiconductor overgrowth, as well as the integrity of the heterointerfaces, are of paramount importance. While the epitaxial growth of metals on semiconductors is now relatively routine with low temperature growth techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy, for example epitaxial metallization systems reported to be grown on GaAs are Al, Ag, Fe, and body-centered-cubic Co among others, see A. Y. Cho and P.D. Dernier, J. Appl. Phys., 49.3328 (1978); J. Massies, P. Delescluse, 

P. Etienne and N.T. Linh, Thin Solid Films, 90, 113 (1980); J.R. Waldrop and R.W. Grant, Appl. Phys. Lett, 34, 630 (1979); G.A. Prinz and J.J. Krebs, Appl. Phys. Lett., 39.397 (1981); and G.A. Prinz, Phys. Rev. Lett, 54, 1051 (1985) which are incorporated herein by reference, it is noted that these metal/semiconductors heterostructures are not thermodynamically stable since the metals will react with As and/or Ga to form metal-As (M-As) and metal-Ga (M-Ga) compounds. In addition, the Al-containing compounds are susceptible to an Al/Ga exchange reaction at elevated temperatures. A much more serious limitation has been
