<ABSTRACT>
Materials containing iron oxide are reduced in a first expanded fluidised bed using solid carbon-containing reducing agents (reductants) under weakly reducing conditions at most to the FeO state. The gas/solid suspension discharged is treated in a second expanded fluidised bed with strongly reducing fluidising gas, with the material being partially reduced to metallic iron. The carbonised carbon-containing material is separated from the gas/solid suspension discharged and is recirculated to the first fluidised bed. A part of the strongly reducing gas is, after purification and removal of CO2, recirculated to the second fluidised bed as fluidising gas. A reduced material having a degree of metallisation of from 50 to 80% together with the remaining part of the carbonised carbon-containing material is discharged from the lower part of the second fluidised bed and is completely reduced and melted in a fusion reactor. The gas evolved from the melt is partially further burnt directly above the melt by blowing-on of oxygen-containing gases and the heat thus generated is largely transferred to the melt. A complete further combustion of the gas is carried out in a subsequent second further combustion (afterburning) process. The material discharged from the lower part of the second fluidised bed can be further reduced in a third fluidised bed to a degree of metallisation of up to 95%.

A process for the direct reduction of iron-oxide-containing 
materials by using solid carbonaceous reducing 

agents, where the iron-oxide-containing materials are reduced 
in a first expanded fluidized bed by supplying 

solid carbonaceous reducing agents as well as fluidizing 
gas under slightly reducing conditions and such a short 

dwell time of the gas in the fluidized bed that the reduction 
potential maximally leads to the reduction to the 

FeO stage, the gas-solids suspension discharged from the 
first expanded fluidized bed is introduced into a second 

expanded fluidized bed, into the second fluidized bed a 
strongly reducing gas is introduced as fluidizing gas, 

from the upper part of the second fluidized bed a 
strongly reducing gas and a large part of the resulting 

calcined carbonaceous material are discharged, the calcined 
carbonaceous material is separated from the gas and 

recirculated to the first fluidized bed, after a cleaning 
and the removal of CO
2
 part of the gas is recirculated as 
fluidizing gas to the second fluidized bed, from the 

lower part of the second fluidized bed the reduced material 
with a metallization of 50 to 80 % is discharged together 

with the remaining part of the calcined carbonaceous 
material, the quantity of the circulated calcined 

carbonaceous material is a multiple of the quantity of 
the charged iron-oxide-containing materials, the heat 

content of the suspension supplied from the first to the 
second fluidized bed is used for covering the heat consumption 

in the second fluidized bed, characterized in 
that the reduced material is completely reduced and molten 

in a melting reactor, the gas escaping from the melt 
is reheated directly above the melt by blowing oxygen-containing 

gases with an oxygen content of at least 50  
 

vol-% onto 40 to 70 vol-% CO
2
 + H
2
O in a gas mixture, 
calculated free from nitrogen, the postcombustion heat is 

largely transferred to the melt, and the partly reheated 
gas mixture is completely reheated in a second postcombustion 

by supplying oxygen-containing gases. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the second postcombustion is effected in the upper part 

of the melting reactor by blowing in oxygen-containing 
gases. 
The process as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
the second postcombustion is effected outside the melting 

reactor. 
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
from the material discharged from the lower part of the 

second fluidized bed the excess calcined carbonaceous material 
is removed by hot screening, where the C content 

in the reduced product is adjusted to a maximum of 5 wt-%, 
and the reduced product is compacted in the hot condition.
