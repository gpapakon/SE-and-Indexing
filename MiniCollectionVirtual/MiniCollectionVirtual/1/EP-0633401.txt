<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic cylinder with a housing (10), having a piston part (30) comprising a piston rod (32) and a piston (31), and a pressure space (60) which is present in the housing, is defined by the piston (31) and can be connected to a pressure-medium connection (62) via a cross-section (61) of passage which can be varied by a choke member (50). Either the housing (10) or the piston part (30) is arranged in a fixed position relative to a frame, while the other one of these two components is movable relative to the frame. In the known hydraulic cylinders, a contraction of the cross-section of passage always occurs in a certain relative position between the housing and the piston part. A hydraulic cylinder is to be created in which the cross-section of passage and thus the speed of the movable component can be varied as a function of the position of an outer stop. This is achieved in that the choke member (50) is arranged on the movable component (30) in such a way that it can be acted upon by the outer stop (70), is movable with the movable component (30), and, after being acted upon by the stop (70), is adjustable relative to the movable component (30) during a further movement of the movable component (30) towards the stop (70), and that the variable cross-section (61) of passage is located between the choke member (50) and the movable component (30).
