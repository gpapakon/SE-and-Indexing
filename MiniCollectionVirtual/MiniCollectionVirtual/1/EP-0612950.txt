<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clamping connection (1) consisting of plastic, having two sleeve-shaped elements (2, 3), of which the end regions (8, 9) overlap one another and are releasibly connected to one another by at least one locking part (10). In this arrangement, one end region (8) exhibits, on the outer circumference, at least two stops (11, 11') which are arranged transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis L-L and behind which there may be introduced, as locking part (10), in each case one latching arm (12, 12') which can pivot transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis and is arranged in the other end region (9), at least one spring element being located in the overlapping zone between the two end regions (8, 9).

Clamping connection consisting of plastic, having 
two sleeve-like elements whose end regions overlap one 

another and are connected to one another in a releasable 
manner by at least one locking part, one end region (8) 

having, on the outer circumference, at least two stops 
(11, 11') which are arranged transversely with respect to 

the longitudinal axis (L-L) and behind which it is 
possible to accommodate, as locking part (10), in each 

case one latching arm (12, 12') which can be pivoted 
transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis (L-L) 

and is arranged in the other end region (9), and there 
being located, in the overlap zone between the two end 

regions (8, 9), at least one spring element (14) which is 
designed as a peripheral, elastic ring, is arranged in 

the end region (8) which has the stops (11, 11') and acts 
on the inner circumference (15) of the other element (9) 

with its end side, the end side of the ring (14) being 
accommodated in at least one groove (17) on the inner 

circumference (15) of the end region (9). 
Clamping connection according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that two stops (11, 11') and two latching arms 

(12, 12') are provided so as to be located opposite one 

another. 
Clamping connection according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the ring (14) is adjoined by a 

peripheral centring flange (16) which is arranged on one 
end region (8) and whose end side rests against the inner 

circumference (15) of the other end region (9). 
Clamping connection according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the overlapping  

 
end region (9) has two recesses (18) in which the stops 

(11, 11') of the other end region (8) can be accommodated, 
and in that the recesses (18) are delimited on the 

end sides by two bearing locations (19, 20; 19', 20') for 
a pivot pin (21, 21') of the respective latching arm (12, 

12'). 
Clamping connection according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that each latching arm 

(12, 12') is of a double-wing design with an engagement 
wing (22, 22') and an actuating wing (23, 23'). 
Clamping connection according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the engagement wing (22, 22') can be 

accommodated in each case in a groove (24, 24') of the 
stop (11, 11'). 
Clamping connection according to Claims 1 and 4, 
characterized in that the stops (11, 11') are located in 

the termination region of the recesses (18).
