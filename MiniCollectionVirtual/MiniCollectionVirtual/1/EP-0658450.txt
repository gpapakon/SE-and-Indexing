<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tyre 
for vehicles having a radial tyre and a tread 
reinforcing breaker and is particularly applicable 
to car tyres but not limited thereto. Current vehicles are being made progressively 
lighter and great demands are made by vehicle makers 
to lighten tyres and improve their other properties 
including handling, wet grip, etc. The present radial tyre development has been 
concentrated on making the tyre footprint consistent 
under all conditions but this has resulted in tyres 
with wide flat tread regions for high cornering 
power in the dry but which are inefficient in 
relation to wet grip. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a pneumatic tyre which overcome these problems and 
provides a tyre of reduced weight. According to the present invention a 
pneumatic radial tyre for a vehicle comprises a 
carcass ply extending between two bead regions and 
passing through a tread region which extends between  
 
two tread contact edges, a tread region reinforcing 
breaker radially outwards of the carcass in the 
tread region and a ground contacting tread surface 
curved in the axial direction characterised in the 
curvature of the outer tread surface when the tyre 
is mounted in a wheel rim and normally inflated has 
a continuously decreasing radius from a point P 
which is at a distance SP in the axial direction 
from the tyre circumferential centreline equal to 
20% of the distance from the tread centre to the 
adjacent tread contact edge. By tread contact edge is meant the edge point 
axially of the tyre at which the tread surface is 
contacted by the road surface in use of the tyre. 
The tread contact surface may have a radius of 
curvature which decreases at a constant rate. Alternatively the curvature may be defined by the 
locus of the point PT with polar co-ordinates R, 
having an origin on the circumferential centreline C 
at a distance below the point of intersection of the 
circumferential centreline C with the tread surface 
wherein 
R = (92.46304 + 50.02951 x  - 109.1216 x 2 
+ 43.74487 x 3 + 7.385639 x 4 - 4.776894 x 5) 
x (SW/194)   
 
as  decreases in the range from π/2 radians to zero 
and wherein SW is the value in millimetres of the 
maximum section width of the tyre. Preferably the 
polar co-ordinates R, have an origin on the 
circumferential centreline C at a distance of 
(70.63044 x (SW/194))mm below the point of
