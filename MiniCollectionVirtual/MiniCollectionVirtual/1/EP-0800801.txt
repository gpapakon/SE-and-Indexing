<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to an expandable stent (10) 
for implanting in a body lumen, such as a coronary artery. The 

stent has an open lattice structure and is constructed so that 
at least one end section (36,38) has a thicker cross-section 

and corresponding greater radial strength than the remaining 
sections of the stent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to expandable endoprosthesis 
devices, generally referred to as stents, which are adapted to 
be implanted into a body lumen of a patient, such as a blood 
vessel or coronary artery, to maintain the patency thereof. 
These devices are useful in the treatment of atherosclerotic 
stenosis in blood vessels. Stents generally are tubular-shaped devices which 
function to hold open a segment of a blood vessel or other 
anatomical lumen. Stents are particularly suitable for use to 
support and hold back a dissected arterial lining, which can 
occlude the fluid passageway therethrough, and to hold open a 
coronary artery after an angioplasty procedure. Further details of prior art stents can be found in 
U.S. Patent 3,868,956 (Alfidi et al.); U.S. Patent 4,512,338 
(Balko et al.); U.S. Patent 4,553,545 (Maass et al.); U.S. 
Patent 4,733,665 (Palmaz); U.S. Patent 4,762,128 (Rosenbluth); 
U.S. Patent 4,800,882 (Gianturco); U.S. Patent 4,856,516 
(Hillstead); and U.S. Patent 4,886,062 (Wiktor). Various means have been described to deliver and 
implant stents. One method frequently described for delivering 
a stent to a desired intraluminal location includes mounting 
the expandable stent on an expandable member, such as a 
balloon, provided on the distal end of an intravascular 
catheter, advancing the catheter to the desired location within 
the patient's body lumen, inflating the balloon to expand the 
stent into a permanent expanded condition and then deflating 
the balloon and removing the catheter. Prior art stent designs provide a stent that is composed 
of wire mesh or weave having an open lattice structure or 
patterns. The open lattice structure of the prior art stents 
generally provide uniform strength along the center of the 
stent, but may be weak at the ends. This configuration may  
 
cause the prior art stents to be weaker at the stent ends 
because each portion at the ends has only one neighboring 
support portion. This inherent weakness at the ends of the 
prior art stents could result in the ends decreasing in 
diameter after implantation in a body lumen. It may therefore be important to improve existing 
stent designs to provide stronger ends while allowing the 
centers to maintain the radial rigidity needed to hold open a 
body lumen while at the same time maintaining the longitudinal 
flexibility of the stent to facilitate its delivery into the 
blood vessel. Embodiments of the present invention are directed to an expandable 
stent which is constructed so as to vary its

An intravascular stent (10) for implanting in a body 
lumen, comprising: 


an elongated tubular body having a first end section 
(36) and a second end section (38), and a central section (37); 
said elongated tubular member also having an open 
lattice structure and adapted for radial expansion from a first 

compressed diameter, to an enlarged, second diameter; and 
said first end section (36) having a thicker open 
lattice structure than said central section (37) and said 

second end section (38), so that when said stent is expanded to 
said enlarged, second diameter, said thicker open lattice 

structure of said first end section is radially stronger and 
more crush resistant than said central section and said second 

end section. 
The stent of claim 1, wherein both said first end 
section (36) and second end section (38) have a thicker open 

lattice structure than does said central section (37), making 
said first and second end sections substantially radially 

stronger than said central section. 
The stent of claim 1, wherein said thicker open 
lattice structure gradually becomes thicker from about said 

central section (37) toward said first end section (36). 
The stent of claim 1, wherein said thicker open 
lattice structure of said first end section (36) is on an 

arcuate section (40) of said first end section. 
The stent of claim 1, wherein said thicker open 
lattice structure of said stent is on an arcuate section (40) 

of all of said sections (36,38,37) of said stent. 
A longitudinally flexible stent (10) for implanting 
in a body lumen, comprising: 


a plurality of cylindrical elements (12) which are 
independently expandable in the radial direction and which are 

interconnected so as to be generally aligned on a common 
longitudinal axis, at least some of said cylindrical elements 

having a thicker cross section than other cylindrical elements; 
a plurality of connecting elements (13) for 
interconnecting said cylindrical elements (12), said connecting 

elements (13) configured to interconnect only said cylindrical 
elements (12) that are adjacent to each other so that as said 

stent (10) is expanded radially outwardly from a first diameter 
to a second, enlarged diameter, said cylindrical elements 

having said thicker cross-section providing substantially more 
radial support in the body lumen. 
The stent of claim 6, wherein said plurality of 
cylindrical elements (12) includes a first end cylindrical 

element (36,12) and a second end cylindrical element (38,12), 
said first end cylindrical element having said thicker 

cross-section than said other cylindrical elements. 
The stent of claim 7, wherein said first (36,12) and 
second (38,12)end cylindrical elements having said thicker 

cross-sections than said other cylindrical elements. 
A longitudinally flexible stent (10), comprising: 

a plurality of cylindrical elements (12) which are 
independently expandable in the radial direction and which are 

interconnected so as to be concentrically aligned on a common 
longitudinal axis, and which are constructed such that at least 

one end (36) of said flexible stent has cylindrical elements 
(12) that are radially stronger than said cylindrical elements
