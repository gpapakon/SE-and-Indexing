<ABSTRACT>
When determining a quantization of digital audio signals having 
spectral and temporal structure wherein the audio signals are buffered 

in frames and decomposed into its spectral components, the method is: 
obtaining a variance and/or a representative of the components of the 

the frame within a defined frequency interval; computing a necessary 
bandwidth using a psychoacoustics criteria; determining an initial 

quantizations of each of the frequency interval using an approximate 
mathematical model; and iteratively increasing quantizations of each 

the frequency interval through a psychoacoustically weighted inverse 
relationship with the the variance of each of the frequency interval.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the efficient information coding of 
digital audio signals for transmission or digital storage media , 
especially a quantization method using an efficient bit allocation 
method for information coding . Compression algorithms for wide band audio signals are finding 
wide-spread applications in recent years. In the area of consumer 
electronics, the digital compact cassette (DCC) and the mini-disc 
system (MD) are two applications of these compression algorithms.
 
While the DCC system uses a compression algorithm that is based on 
sub-band coding, the MD system uses an algorithm that is based on a 
hybrid of sub-band and transform coding with the transform coding 
portion forming the backbone of the algorithm. This invention is 
related to the dynamic bit allocation of the MD coder. The MD system uses the ATRAC compression algorithm that is  
 
documented in chapter 10 of the MD system description by Sony in 
December 1991. The ATRAC algorithm compresses the input audio 
signals at a bit rate of 705.6 k bit/s/channel to a bit rate of 
146.08 k bit/s/channel. Fig. 8 shows the block diagram of the encoding process. The input 
time signals are first passed through a splitting filter bank, 1, 2, 3, 
to obtain the signals in three frequency bands. The lower two bands 
are each at half the bandwidth of the uppermost band. Block size 
decision, 4, is made for each band to determine the sample size or 
block mode for the windowing and transform process, 5, 6, 7. One of 
the two block modes available - short block mode or long block mode, 
will be selected for each of the bands. The transformed spectral 
samples are grouped into units and in each unit, a scale factor is 
derived from the peak values of the samples in the unit, 8. These 
units are non-uniform frequency intervals with a finer resolution in 
the low frequencies and coarser resolution in the higher frequencies. 
Quantization, 10, is carried out on the samples using the scale factor 
and bit allocation information from the dynamic bit allocation module, 
9. The dynamic bit allocation method forms an integral part in any 
adaptive compression algorithm. The quality of the reconstructed 
output and the extent of redundancy and irrelevancy removal are  
 
largely determined by the bit allocation method. In addition, the 
bit allocation procedure also plays a part in determining the degree 
of hardware complexity. As the bit allocation in the ATRAC algorithm 
is mainly applied to the transformed spectral samples, quite a number
