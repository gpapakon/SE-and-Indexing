<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum weldment is produced by resistance-welding 
aluminum workpieces, and has a nugget formed between 

the aluminum workpieces which contains more magnesium than 
the base material of the aluminum workpieces. The nugget 

contains 5 ∼ 17 wt % of magnesium which forms a solid solution 
with aluminum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum weldment,
i.e., a welded assembly of aluminum workpieces, and a
method of resistance welding such aluminum workpieces.Resistance welding is a welding process in which
electrodes of copper or the like are held in contact with
workpieces and supply an electric current to regions of the
workpieces that are to be welded while the workpieces are being
pressed against each other, for raising the temperature
of the workpiece regions due to resistive heating thereby to
weld the workpiece regions.Workpieces of aluminum produce a small amount of
heat and diffuse generated heat to a large extent because
they have a small specific resistance and a large thermal
conductivity. To resistance-weld aluminum workpieces, it is
necessary to supply a large welding current to the aluminum
workpieces in order to generate an increased amount of heat.
However, a large welding current causes the surfaces of the
aluminum workpieces which contact the electrodes to produce a
large amount of heat, which tends to form an alloy of copper
and aluminum at the tip ends of the electrodes. The electrodes
that are alloyed with aluminum have a reduced service
life. Another problem is that the initial and running costs
of the welding machine used are high as the welding machine
needs to be large in capacity due to the large current requirement.
The mechanical strength of the joined spot
(hereinafter referred to as a "nugget") of the aluminum workpieces
is liable to be lower than that of the base material.
Particularly in spot welding, the mechanical strength of the
nugget often drops to or below 60 % of that of the base material.
For this reason, an increased welding current is supplied
to increase the joining area of aluminum workpieces, or
an increased number of spots are produced to weld aluminum 
workpieces. However, increasing the welding current requires
large-size and high-performance equipment, and increasing the
number of spots results in an increased number of welding
steps.To solve the above problems, there has been proposed
a resistance welding process which employs an insert of
low electric conductivity that is interposed between joining
surfaces of aluminum workpieces for a lower welding current
requirement and a higher heating efficiency. One known insert
comprises a thin film of zinc as disclosed in Japanese
patent publication No. 54-41550. The thin film of zinc is
interposed between regions of aluminum plates which are to be
resistance-welded, and then instantaneously melted in a
