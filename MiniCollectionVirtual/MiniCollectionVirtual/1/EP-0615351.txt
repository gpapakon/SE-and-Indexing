<ABSTRACT>
In a transmission level control system in a radio communication 
station where an in-station apparatus (201) is connected with an 

antenna site (101) through a transmission line (301), the in-station 
apparatus includes a plurality of burst carrier 

transmitters (BWT1-BWTm), and the antenna site comprises a level 
controller (102) for controlling the level of the carriers so as to 

compensate the received carriers for level reduction stemming from 
the transmission line. The in-station apparatus (201) further 

comprises a carrier combiner (203) for combining the transmitted 
burst carriers to transmit them to the antenna site through the 

transmission line, a selector (205) for selecting one of the burst 
carrier transmitters, and a controller (204) for activating the 

level control operation of the level controller (102) in the 
antenna site only when only the burst carrier transmitter selected 

by the selector outputs the transmitted carrier, otherwise 
inhibiting. In cases where there are some continuous carriers in 

the transmitted carriers, the level control operation is activated 
only when all the transmitted carriers are continuous carriers, 

otherwise inhibited.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transmission level control
in radio communication, and more particularly, to a transmission
level control system and method in a radio communication station
where transmission carriers combine to be transmitted through a
transmission line to an antenna site where transmission processing
such as level control and power amplification is carried out to
transmit them by radio.With the remarkable progress of the satellite communication
technique in recent years, satellite communication has become
vigorously utilized in various applications such as satellite
broadcasting, public communication, and the like. With such a
trend, there have been earth stations of various sizes and
structures ranging from a large scale station for public
communication, which is provided with an antenna of 10 meters in
diameter, to a domestic satellite broadcast receiver.A large scale station, in general, employs an arrangement in
which the communication apparatus placed within the station house
is connected with the antenna site by a transmission line. A
schematic arrangement of a transmission system in such an earth
station is shown in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 1, the antenna site 1 is connected with the
in-station apparatus 2 through the transmission line 3. Since the
carriers received from the in-station apparatus 2 are subject to
level reduction stemming from the transmission line 3, the antenna
site 1 is provided with an automatic level control(ALC) circuit for
controlling the carrier level so as to compensate the received
carriers for the level reduction. Further transmission processing,
such as conversion of the transmission frequency, is carried out,
and the resulting carriers are amplified in power by means of a
HPA (high power amplifier) to emit them from the antenna toward the
satellite.Typically, such an earth station is required to combine a
plurality of carriers for emitting them from a single antenna
simultaneously. In the in-station apparatus 2, a multi-carrier
controller 4 is comprised of a carrier combiner 5 for combining the
carriers received from the burst carrier transmitters (BWT) with the carriers
received from the continuous carrier transmitters (CWT). The combined carriers
are transmitted to the ALC of the antenna site 1 through the
transmission line 3 together with the calculated combined level of
the carriers.The burst carrier and the continuous carrier mentioned above
mean a short isolated sequence of modulated carriers and a
continuous modulated carrier,
