<ABSTRACT>
A process is set forth for removing oxygen from an oxygen-containing 
feed stream comprising passing the oxygen-containing stream through a 

multi-layered adsorption bed comprising a kinetic based oxygen-selective 
adsorbent at the feed end of the bed and an equilibrium based oxygen-selective 

adsorbent at the product end of the bed wherein regeneration of 
the bed includes a "hybrid repressurization" scheme which involves 

simultaneously repressurizing the bed with a portion of both the product 
stream and the feed stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an adsorption process for oxygen 
removal using a multi-layered adsorbent bed comprising a kinetic based 
oxygen-selective adsorbent at the feed end of the bed and an equilibrium 
based oxygen-selective adsorbent at the product end of the bed. An adsorption process for oxygen removal using a multi-layered 
adsorbent bed comprising a kinetic based oxygen-selective adsorbent at the 
feed end of the bed and an equilibrium based oxygen-selective adsorbent at 
the product end of the bed is taught in the art. Specifically, Japanese 
Laid-Open Patent Application No. 63-240914 by Takahashi et al. teaches such 
a process. A key advantage of such a multi-layered bed design is that 
because the kinetic based adsorbent (typically a carbon molecular sieve or 
a zeolite) accomplishes the bulk of the oxygen removal, the rapid kinetics 
and high selectivity of the equilibrium adsorbent can be utilized for trace 
oxygen removal without subjecting the equilibrium adsorbent to 
destructively high oxygen concentrations. There is a problem in Takahashi, however, in that Takahashi uses 
product gas alone to repressurize the adsorbent bed. This is not very 
practical where the product gas is expensive such as in the case of oxygen 
removal from an argon stream. The present invention minimizes this problem 
with a "hybrid repressurization" scheme which involves simultaneously 
repressurizing the bed with a portion of both the product stream and the 
feed stream. Although hybrid repressurization is taught in the art with respect to 
single layer adsorption beds (see for example US Patent 4,917,710 by Haruna 
et al.), heretofore, the art does not teach hybrid repressurization in the 
context of a multi-layered adsorbent bed comprising a kinetic based oxygen-selective 
adsorbent at the feed end of the bed and an equilibrium based 
oxygen-selective adsorbent at the product end of the bed. Furthermore, the 
art heretofore does not recognize that, as discussed infra, hybrid 
repressurization scheme is uniquely suited for repressurization of a multi-layered 
bed such as Takahashi's.  The present invention is a process for removing oxygen from an 
oxygen-containing feed stream comprising passing the oxygen-containing 
stream through a multi-layered adsorption bed comprising a kinetic based 
oxygen-selective adsorbent at the feed end of the bed and an equilibrium 
based oxygen-selective adsorbent at the product end of the bed wherein 
regeneration of the bed includes a "hybrid repressurization" scheme.

<CLAIMS>
In a process for removing oxygen from an oxygen-containing feed 
stream comprising: 


(a) passing the oxygen-containing stream through a multi-layered 
adsorption bed having a feed end and a product end wherein said bed 

contains a kinetic based oxygen-selective adsorbent at its feed end and an 

equilibrium based oxygen-selective adsorbent at its product end to produce 
an oxygen saturated adsorption bed and an oxygen-depleted product stream; 
(b) depressurizing the bed to produce an oxygen-enriched product 
stream; and 
(c) repressurizing the bed; 
 
the improvement comprising repressurizing the bed in step (c) with a 

portion of both the oxygen-depleted product stream and the feed stream 
wherein the oxygen-depleted product stream is introduced into the product 

end of the bed while the feed stream is simultaneously introduced into the 
feed end of the bed. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the oxygen-containing feed 
stream comprises oxygen and argon. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the oxygen-containing feed 
stream comprises air. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein steps (a) through (c) are 
performed as a continually repeating cycle of steps in a system comprising 

a plurality of adsorption beds which each undergo their respective cycle of 
steps while collectively operated sequentially in parallel with one 

another. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the adsorption bed contains an 
initial layer of a desiccant material in order to dry the feed stream 

before it reaches the kinetic based oxygen-selective adsorbent. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the adsorption bed is 
purged/rinsed with a portion of the less adsorbable component immediately 

before the depressurization step. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the adsorption bed is 
purged/rinsed with a portion of the less adsorbable component immediately 

after the depressurization step. 
The process of Claim 4 which further comprises one or more 
pressure equalization transfers, during each of which, a portion of the 

depressurization effluent from one of said plurality of beds is transferred 
to another bed as partial repressurization gas, thereby equalizing the 

pressures of the two beds involved in each pressure equalization transfer.
