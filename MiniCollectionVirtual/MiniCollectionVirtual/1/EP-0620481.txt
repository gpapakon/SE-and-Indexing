<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic light-sensitive material is 
disclosed. The light-sensitive material comprises a support 

having thereon a silver halide emulsion layer and a 
hydrophilic colloid layer provided at the farthest position 

from the surface of the support on which the emulsion layer is 
provided. In the light-sensitive material, the silver halide 

emulsion layer contains tabular silver halide grains each 
having an aspect ratio of not less than 3; and the hydrophilic 

colloid layer contains a polymer latex comprising a polymer 
which comprises a repeating unit derived from a monomer having 

a solubility in water of not higher than 0.025 % in weight at 
25°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic
light-sensitive material and, particularly, to a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material capable excellently
displaying a scratch resistance and a drying property when
rapidly processing it through an automatic processor.In recent years, a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material has been required to display a rapid
processability and, particularly, to display such a rapid
processing function as a super-rapid processing function
performable within 45 seconds from Dry to Dry, in addition to
a high sensitive speed, a high contrast, an excellent
graininess, an image sharpness and so forth. Particularly, an
X-ray photographic light-sensitive material for medical
diagnostic use has been required to process it rapidly so that
a decisive diagnosis can be made earlier. For example, a 
rapid processing has been inevitable for an angiography for
which a catheter is inserted in a blood vessel and a contrast
medium is injected at a high pressure therein, or for an under-operation
photography in which an X-ray photograph is taken
under operation.As for a means for satisfying the above-mentioned
requirements, a photographing, transporting, processing and so
forth have been automated and, at the same time, a rapid
processability has been tried to provide to a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material. However, a rapid
process has had such a problem that an image quality is
deteriorated by a high temperature (at 30 to 40°C) and a high
pH, a dryness has not been maintained by a high-speed
transportation and a carry-over increase caused by a
processing chemical.For satisfying the above-mentioned requirements for a
high image quality, tabular-shaped silver halide grains have
recently been used. Tabular-shaped silver halide grains have
a large specific surface area. It has, therefore, been
observed that a color sensitization efficiency has been
improved by a sensitizing dye, that is, the so-called covering
power has been improved. Also, in a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material for X-ray photographic
use, a cross-over light has remarkably been reduced and, at
the same time, an image having a few light scattering and a
high resolving power has also been obtained. However, the above-mentioned tabular-shaped grains have
had such a defective that a pressure fog has been produced,
such as a blacked trouble produced by an external force such
as a bent of an unexposed light-sensitive material in handling
or a streaky fog
