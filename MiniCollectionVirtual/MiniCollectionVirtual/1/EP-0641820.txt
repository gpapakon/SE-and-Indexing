<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safe and simple
process for the preparation of a novel and useful organosilicon
polymer.It is known that a polyorganosilane is useful as an
electrically conductive organic material, a nonlinear optical
material, a photodecomposable reaction initiator, a silicon
carbide precursor, or a photoresist material (see
Miller, R.D.; Michl. J., Chem. Rev., 89, 1359 (1989)).Wurtz method using an organohalosilane or
organohalodisilane as a starting material has been widely used
as a process for the preparation of a polyorganosilane.
However, the Wurtz method is disadvantageous in that the use of
metallic sodium or metallic potassium, which is self-igniting,
in the air involves some risk, the reaction conditions are too
severe to control the molecular weight of the product, and a
polyorganosilane having a bimodal distribution of molecular
weight.In order to overcome these disadvantages, some
approaches have been attempted. For example, Shono et al.
obtained silicone polymers having organic groups comprising
atoms and atomic groups other than silicon incorporated in the
main chain having weight-average molecular weight of 5,000 to 
18,000 by an electrode reaction using bis(halosilyl) compounds
as starting materials (JP-A-4-348128 (The term "JP-A" as used
herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application")). Asuke et al. obtained a silicon polymer having
benzene ring incorporated in its main chain by reacting
dichlorosilane with dilithiobenzene in a proportion of 1 : 1
(JP-A-4-342726). Ishikawa et al. obtained an electrically
conductive polymer having thienyl group incorporated in its
main chain by polymerizing a bis(5-halogen magnesium thiophene)
silane derivative in the presence of a nickel catalyst (JP-A-4-218533).Further, Ishikawa et al. obtained a polymer having
ethynylene incorporated in its main chain by allowing a cyclic
silane derivative containing ethynylene to undergo ring opening
polymerization (Organometallics 1992. 11. 1604-1618).
Kashizaki et al. obtained a polysilane copolymer soluble in an
organic solvent by conducting the Wurtz reaction of a
dichlorosilane monomer with an α,α'-dichloroxylene derivative.
Yamashita et al. obtained silicon polymers having quinone
incorporated in Si-Si bond by reacting disilanylene polymers
with quinones (Macromolecules 1993. 26. 2143-2144).The disproportionation reaction using an alkoxydisilane
is advantageous in that the reaction can be effected under mild
conditions without using metallic sodium or metallic
