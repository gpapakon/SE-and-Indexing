<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for fabricating a 
rubberized wire sheet is described. A plurality of 

wires 200 pass through an extruder 10. The extruder 

10 coats each wire 200 with rubber 210 to form 
rubberized wires 201. The plurality of rubberized 

wires 201 pass through a calender roller system 50 to 
form them into the rubberized wire sheet 202 having a 

desired width. The method permits the manufacture of 
wire reinforced sheets 202 whereby the wires 200 may 

be coated with an extruded rubber compound and then 
encapsulated by a calender compound differing in 

chemical composition from the extruded rubber 
compound. The above-described sheet can be used in 

the manufacture of reinforcing components of a tire 
20.

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing fabric or cord-reinforced
laminated material, the fabric or cords

occupying a predetermined width (W), the method
comprising the steps of:


a) feeding the fabric or cords (200) oocupying a
predetermined width (W) through a roll

calender;
b) preparing a first (214) and second (212) layer
of elastomeric material by feeding the material

through the calender rollers (51,52,53,54);
c) forming a reinforcing member on the calender
rolls (51,52,53,54);
d) withdrawing the reinforced laminated material
from the calender; and
e) cutting the material to length;

characterized in that the reinforced member is
formed in step c) by


ci) cutting a first edge (221) on the first
layer (214);
cii) encapsulating the fabric or cords (200)
between the first and second layers (214,

212) of elastomeric material,
ciii) cutting a second edge (222) through the
first and second layers at an axial

distance W1 from the first edge,
civ) cutting a third edge (223), the third edge
cutting through the second layer (212) at

an axial distance W2 beyond the first edge
(221), the material extending beyond the

first edge forming a gum lip (208).
The method of claim 1, wherein the cords (200)
are wires. 
The method of claim 2, comprising the steps of:

a) orienting the wires (200) in spaced alig nment;
b) feeding the wires through a die (206), the die

c) injecting a first elastomeric compound (210)

from the extruder into the die (206), the first
elastomeric compound circumferentially

encapsulating each of the wires (200) with a
coating while maintaining spaced alignment of

the coated wires;
d) feeding the coated wires through a calender

e) applying said first layer (214) and said second
layer (212) of a second elastomeric compound

(218) to the coated wires (201), the wires
