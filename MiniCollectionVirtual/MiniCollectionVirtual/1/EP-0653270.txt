<ABSTRACT>
A method of polishing semiconductor wafers and apparatus 
therefor, wherein a semiconductor wafer (W) mounted on 

the lower side of a wafer mounting plate (19) may be 
polished on a polishing pad (32) by the front referenced 

polishing technique due to a flexibility of the wafer 
mounting plate to make the same conform in detail with 

the backside contour of the wafer under polishing 
pressure and a selected flexibility differential between 

a wafer holding region (20) and an outer moving region 
(21) of the wafer mounting plate (19). An apparatus 

according to an aspect of the present invention is 
structured in such a manner that the wafer mounting 

plate (19) also functions as a vacuum chuck plate 
constructed of a flexible thin disc of hard plastics, a 

central round region is used for a wafer holding region 
(20) facing the backside of the wafer and an outside 

annular region is more flexible to function as a moving 
region (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of polishing
semiconductor wafers and apparatus therefor and, more
particularly, a method of polishing semiconductor wafers and
apparatus therefor suitable for a so-called planarization
process to improve global surface flatness of a
semiconductor wafer in the making in VLSI process.Interconnections between components on top of a chip is
increasingly demanding a larger space to occupy thereon, as
the semiconductor industry further implements submicron
technology. Therefore, miniaturization of patterns and usage
of multi-leveled interconnections will take a more and more 
important role in VLSI technology. Along this trend in VLSI
technology, a semiconductor wafer is required flat to close
tolerances across one face thereof, where other materials
are applied to form desired circuitry, that is, an
interlevel dielectric film is deposited on the semiconductor
wafer in preparation for next optical lithography to print
miniatured patterns for interconnections on the surfaceIn the direction of the miniaturization the
interconnections have a trend where the width of each
interconnection will become narrower while the thickness is
kept on as it has been. Along this line of development in
technolgy, insulator coverage on and around a wiring on a
substrate grows poorer and poorer due to the structural
sharpness of the recent wiring, which means a right angle to
the base dielectric film or overhanging of the sides of the
wiring on the substrate.Progress in VLSI technology develops more and more
stringent requirements on planarization processes. This
trend accelerates application of the chemical mechanical
polishing of silicon dioxide used as an interlevel
dielectric film for the manufacture of VLSI chips. Techniques presently used include glass reflow, bias
sputter deposition, and a number of processes involving
application of material in the liquid state by a spin
process. None of these will planarize topography with a
lateral dimension lager than 10 to 100 Âµm. Phosphorous-doped
silicon dioxide is frequently used in order to ensure
uniform coverage of the next conducting layer. Chemical
deposition methods are used to produce the silicon dioxide
film across a substrate as an insulator between metal
layers, for example, interconnections as well as a final
passivation over devices, and as a gettering source.Phosphorous-doped silicon oxides such as PSG and BPSG
are applied on chips in the form of a film covering minute
step structures on the surface, which is followed by heat
t
