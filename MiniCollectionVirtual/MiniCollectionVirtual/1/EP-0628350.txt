<ABSTRACT>
In a device for comminuting and mixing material (4), a cutter (12) rotates in the working space (2) of a container (3). During the comminuting and mixing, the working space (2) can be made smaller by a piston (13).

<CLAIMS>
A device for the size reduction and mixing of material (4) with a rotating knife (12) which
may be brought into the operating space (2) of a size reduction container (3), characterised

in that the operating space (2) of the size reduction container (3) during the size reduction
and mixing, from its upper side is made smaller in volume, and that the rotating knife (12)

simultaneously is lowered from above to below.
A device for the size reduction and mixing of material (4) with a knife (12) rotating in an
operating space (2) of a size reduction container (3) with a means (13, 17) for making

smaller the operating space (2) during the size reduction and mixing of the material, said
means (13, 17) able to be pressed onto the material (4), wherein the knife (12) on a rotating

shaft (11) is arranged lowerable into the size reduction container (3), characterised in that a
part of the operating space in the radial direction on the one side is defined by the rotating

shaft and on the other side by the inner wall of the size reduction container, and that the cutting
region of the knife in the operating space seen from the rotating shaft extends radially

outwards, by which means the material with the means (13, 17) for the making smaller the
operating space may be retained in the cutting region of the knife (12).
A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the means for making smaller the operating
space comprises a piston (13) arranged displaceable in the size reduction container (3).
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that the piston (13) is lowerably arranged.
A device according to one of the claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the shaft (11) and the
piston (13) are fastened on a lowerable mounting (10).
A device according to one of the preceding claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the means
(13, 17) for reducing the operating space (2), by way of a spring arrangement (15), is resiliently

mounted in a manner such that on advance or lowering onto the material (4) in a pre-determined
operating region it can be pressed resiliently against the material. 
A device according to claim 6, characterised in that the rotating shaft (11) and the spring
means (15) are fastened on a common mounting (10) and are lowerable with this into the

size reduction container (3).
