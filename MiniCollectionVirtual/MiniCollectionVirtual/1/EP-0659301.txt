<ABSTRACT>
A jack connector device (12) allows a plurality of modular jacks to be mounted thereon. An elongated housing (14) is provided in the jack connector device and a plurality of socket sections (16) are set along a length of the housing. One modular jack is fitted into the respective socket section. Further, contact terminals (18) are arranged in the respective socket section. The respective socket section corresponds to the single modular jack connector. By mounting the housing on a printed circuit board, it is possible to achieve the same function as when a plurality of modular jack connectors are mounted on the printed circuit board at a time.

<DESCRIPTION>
 JACK CONNECTOR DEVICEBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a jack connector device and, more in particular, to a jack connector device which can connect a plurality of jack connectors to a printed circuit board.2. Description of the Related ArtA modular jack connector is printed circuit board mount type connector and is used to connect a cable which is run from outside a communications unit for instance to a printed circuit board present within the communications unit. In recent years, this type of connector has been employed not only for communications units but also for the interface, etc., of an office automation unit and peripheral units.Such connectors are each employed to receive those modular jacks in a single cable and, in order to corre¬ spond to the number of cables to be connected to the printed circuit board, a plurality of connectors are mounted on that printed circuit board.This type of connector is usually of a compact type and a time consuming operation is required in mounting a larger number of such connectors on the printed circuit board. Readier mounting of the connectors iε, therefore, required.Summary of the Invention It is accordingly the object of the present 

invention to provide a jack connector device which sat¬ isfies the aforementioned requirement and ensures its readier mounting on the printed circuit board.According to the present invention, there is pro- vided a jack connector device for connecting a plurality of jack connectors to a printed circuit board, the jack connector device comprising: an elongated, insulating houεing having socket sections set, in a single array, along a length of the houεing and holding jack connectorε adapted to receive given plug terminals; and contact terminals provided in the respective socket sections to connect the plug terminals to the printed circuit board. According to the above connector structure, a respective recess in the housing which receives the con¬ tact terminals corresponds to one modular jack connector. A single housing mounted on the printed cir¬ cuit board serves as being equivalent to a plurality of modulator jack connectors.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a front view showing a jack connector device according to an embodiment of the present invention; Fig. 2 iε a top view εhowing the jack connector device of Fig. 1 as viewed in a direction in which modu¬ lar jacks are received; and 

 Fig. 3 is a side view showing the jack connector device of Fig. 1.Detailed
