<ABSTRACT>
A display of an image includes a clear glass 
substrate. A mixture of phosphor and pigment is applied to 

one surface of the substrate by screen printing methods. 
A glass frame is applied with a bonding material to the 

surface of the substrate on which the image is printed to 
form a chamber around the image. A superstrate of glass is 

bonded to the frame to enclose the chamber. An anode and 
a cathode are mounted through the superstrate so as to be 

exposed to the chamber. The chamber is evacuated, and a 
rare gas is introduced into the chamber. A voltage is 

applied to the anode and cathode to convert the rare gas to 
a plasma, thereby causing the phosphor to emit visible 

light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains generally to signs and 
displays. More specifically, the present invention relates 
to display signage whose images, created by a screen 
printing process, are excited into phosphorescence by a 
rare gas plasma. The present invention is particularly, 
but not exclusively, useful for displays which include 
internal illumination. Displays and signs are used for a wide range of 
communication purposes. Signs are used to solicit 
business, to inform the public, to educate, to promote 
trademarks and service marks, and for a number of 
permutations of similar purposes limited only by the 
intent, intelligence and cleverness of the user. Indeed, 
displays and signs have proliferated, becoming so numerous 
that the purpose of the person displaying a sign may be 
attenuated by the vast number of competing displays. The 
visual bombardment on consumers, customers and others 
exposed to signage is pervasive: television, rented movies, 
highway signs, retail displays, all compete to present 
images and messages which are not only inherently 
compelling, but also sufficiently unique in presentation to 
cause a viewer to pause and react favorable to the display. 
Accordingly, there is an ever increasing demand for a sign 
which displays an image in a new, interesting, and 
compellingly attractive manner. The present invention recognizes that signs which are 
lighted within the visible range of light are appealing to 
viewers. Particularly appealing, and particularly visible 
from long distances, are signs using rare gases such as 
neon. Neon signs have proven to be not only effective, but 
aesthetically popular. In the past, neon has been used in 
connection with signage because its natural color is red, 
a compelling color to most viewers. By adding mercury to  
 
neon, a brilliant blue color appears in conventional 
signage. The conventional method of making a neon display is to 
remove air from glass tubes by forming a partial vacuum 
within a closed tube. The closed tube is then filled with 
neon gas. A neon tube usually has two electrodes sealed 
within the tube, comprising a cathode and an anode. When 
approximately 15,000 volts of electricity are applied to 
the electrode system, an electric discharge occurs. The 
electric discharge excites the molecules in the neon gas. 
The tube glows with an exceptionally bright color. Neon is a rare gas, and it is expensive. While not 
much neon is needed for neon lamps, neon signs are more 
expensive to make, maintain, and operate.
