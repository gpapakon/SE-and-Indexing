<ABSTRACT>
This suction housing (inlet housing) essentially consists of a flange 4, for connection to a pump casing 2, and an intake funnel 1 and is used, for example, in tubular type pumps. In order to maintain suitable suction conditions for operation of the pump in conjunction with compact construction, the intake funnel 1 has perforated side walls which are flared towards its inlet opening.   The suction housing is suitable, for example, for tubular type pumps provided with a suction chamber.
