<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory device having memory cells
formed with ferroelectric capacitors.A dynamic random access memory (DRAM) that a data is stored in a memory cell
capacitor thereof is generally known as one of semiconductor memory cell devices.
A silicon oxide film is conventionally used as an insulating film of the memory cell
capacitor.In recent years, various DRAMs using a ferroelectric material for the insulating film
of the capacitor have been developed to realize nonvolatility of stored data. (US 4
873 664). As one of such DRAMs, a semiconductor memory device having the
structure as described below is known.This semiconductor memory device comprises, as basic components, a memory
cell having a MOS transistor and a ferroelectric capacitor, a pair of bit lines coupled
to the memory cell, a word line coupled to the memory cell, a plate line coupled to
the memory cell, and a sense amplifier coupled to the pair of bit lines. The MOS
transistor of the memory cell is coupled to the bit lines while the ferroelectric
capacitor is coupled between the MOS transistor and the plate line.Writing of data in this semiconductor memory device is performed by the method
which consists in applying a reverse logical voltage to the ferroelectric capacitor of
the memory cell. Reading of data is made by the method which consists in taking
out electric charge stored in the ferroelectric capacitor from the pair of bit lines as
potential and amplifying the potential difference between those bit lines with the
sense amplifier.However, with a semiconductor memory device of the conventional construction as
described above, the potential difference for reading produced between the bit lines
diminishes if the parasitic capacitance value of the bit lines gets smaller. For that
reason, it becomes impossible to accurately amplify this potential difference with
the sense amplifier, leading to frequent errors in the reading.A prior semiconductor memory device (EP0 486 902 A3) as indicated in the
precharacterizing parts of claims 1 and 10 has the adjusting capacitors for adjusting
the bit line capacitance in preamplifiers which are coupled between a bit line and
the corresponding sense amplifier. Then in this prior art memory device at a first
step, data (electric charge) read out from ferroelectric capacitors to a bit line are 
stored in the plurality of adjusting capacitors connected in parallel to the bit line. At
a second step, all capacitors are disconnected from the bit line by switching off
transistors
