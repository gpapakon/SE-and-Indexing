<ABSTRACT>
Coupling part (1) for universal joints, comprising a one-piece, essentially U-shaped yoke which has two fork arms, each with an eye (8) for a journal bearing (3), and a straight or spherical fork base (5) to which a connection (6) for the introduction and take-off of the torques can be connected. In the transition zone between the eye and the base, reinforcing beads (4a, 4b) are provided on the inside or outside of the fork arms and extension rings being arranged on the eyes, a recess (7) being provided on the inside of the fork arms.

<CLAIMS>
Joint half for universal joints, consisting of an integral, substantially U-shaped
carrier prefabricated from sheet metal, the carrier comprising two fork arms (1) each

with an eye bore (8) for a pivot bearing (3) and a straight or spherical fork base to
which a connection for the introduction and elimination of the torques can be

connected, in the transition region between the eye bore (8) and base (5)
reinforcement corrugations (4a, 4b) which are directed toward the inner or outer side

and extend continuously from the eye bore (8) into the base (5) are provided on the
fork arms (1), expansion rings are attached to the eye bores (8) and a recess (7) is

provided on the inner side at the upper end of each fork arm (1), wherein the
installation space for a cross link (2) to be inserted is enlarged by the recesses (7).

the outer sides of the fork arms (1) being bent outwards in the gap between the eye
bores (8) and base (5).
Joint half according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the eye bores (8) are
calibrated for close dimensional tolerances on finish-pressing.
Joint half according to claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that
 the recess (7) is
only provided above the eye bore (8) when an inner corrugation (4a) is used.
Joint half according to either of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in that
 the recess
(7) continues beyond the eye bore (8) in the direction of the base (5) when an outer

corrugation is used.
Joint half according to claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the connection (6) to
the base (5) is designed as a connection sleeve.
Joint half according to claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the connection (6) to
the base (5) takes place by means of a section or a toothing.
