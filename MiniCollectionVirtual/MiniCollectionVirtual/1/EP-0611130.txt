magnetization and to generate echoes. The RF pulse 

sequence may include a sinusoidal waveform 
component defined by either y = sin x, 0 ≦ x ≦ 4π;

defined by either y = 0, 0 ≦ x ≦ 2π, y = π, 2π ≦ x 
≦ 4π; or y = -2πcos x, 0 ≦ x ≦ π/2, y = -2πsin x, 

π/2 ≦ x ≦ π. The selected waveform and phase 
components may be combined to form a first, 

composite RF signal and the Hilbert transform of

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance 
imaging techniques and, more particularly, to 
magnetic resonance imaging techniques which utilize 
various multiple shaped radiofrequency pulse 
sequences, either alone or in combination with 
multiple shaped magnetic field gradient pulse 
sequences, to generate an image of an object in 
which selected components thereof are suppressed 
and/or enhanced. Magnetism results from the motion of electric 
charges such as electrons. Electrons can produce 
a magnetic field either by motion along a path or 
by virtue of their intrinsic spin. The particles 
that comprise the atomic nucleus, collectively 
called nucleons, also have spin and magnetic 
moment. Because both individual nucleons and 
nuclei have a charge distribution, rotation or spin 
of this charge produces a magnetic dipole whose 
value is called a magnetic moment. The numeric 
value of the magnetic moment determines the 
energies of the different orientations of a nucleus 
in an external magnetic field. The proton is 
positively charged and has a relatively large 
magnetic moment. Although neutral, the neutron 
also has a net magnetic moment. A neutron's 
magnetic moment is about two-thirds of the value of 
the proton's and points against the axis of spin. 
When in the nucleus, like nucleons align with their 
spins pointing against each other. This phenomena 
is called "pairing" and is favored because it leads  
 
to a lower nuclear energy state. Therefore, only 
the unpaired, odd proton or neutron, or both, 
contribute their magnetic moment to the nucleus. 
As a consequence, only nuclei with odd numbers of 
protons or neutrons, or both, have a magnetic 
moment. The magnetic properties of nuclei become 
important when they are placed in external magnetic 
fields as the nuclei will have a tendency to align 
with the external field. Resonance occurs when an amount of energy 
equal to the difference of energy associated with 
the transition between states is absorbed or 
released. In the case of a magnetic moment of a 
nucleus, transitions between parallel or "up" and 
anti-parallel or "down" states can occur if the 
correct amount of energy is absorbed or released. 
Because the interaction is with a magnetic element, 
the necessary energy can be provided by a magnetic 
field. One way to obtain such a field is by 
utilizing electromagnetic radiations. To induce 
resonance, the frequency f of the electromagnetic 
radiation must be proportional to the local 
magnetic field HL. The particular proportionality
