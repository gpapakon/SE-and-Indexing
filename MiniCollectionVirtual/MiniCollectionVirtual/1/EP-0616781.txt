<ABSTRACT>
A pear processing method and apparatus is provided which 
includes several mechanisms for properly orienting the pear (7) 

prior to coring, peeling and seed celling of the pear (7). Each 
pear (7) is tumbled between a pair of orienting rolls (30) to a 

position wherein the stem (8) of the pear (7) is oriented downwardly. 
Whiskers (36,37) on one of the rolls (30) speed up this orienting of the 

pear (7). A friction clutch (40) on the other roll helps maintain the 
pear (7) in its proper position, once the proper alignment has 

been attained. The pear (7) is dropped downwardly into a transfer 
cup (70) having four resilient fingers (71-74) which tend to 

orient the 
pear (7). The pear (7) is then pushed out of the transfer cup (70) 

downwardly into a feed cup (110) having a concave receptacle (111) for 
centering the stem (8) of the pear and three upwardly extending 

arms (120-122) which grasp and center the blossom end (9) 
of the pear (7). The 

pear (7) is then transferred to a station wherein the pear (7) is 
cored and thereafter peeled and seed celled simultaneously. 

The stem (8) and blossom (9) are also trimmed. The pear (7) 
is thereafter 

passed into a slice cup (220) having a design which more effectively 
separates the waste from the processed pear.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to pear processing
machines. More particularly, the invention relates to a method
and apparatus for peeling, coring, seed celling and trimming
pears of various sizes and shapes.Pear processing machinery and methods are known in
the prior art. However, this prior art technology suffers from
certain drawbacks. For example, the prior art machines and
methods tend to be less efficient and the machinery tends to
utilize more floor space than is desirable. Prior art machines
and methods tend to be comparatively slow in processing pears
and do not always orientate the pears correctly. Prior art
machines and methods have a tendency to split the pear during
the seed celling operation and are less efficient at
separating the useable portions of the fruit from waste
portions. Also, the prior art machines can be difficult to
maintain due to the fact that they have a large number of
parts. One known prior art device
which discloses the preambles of claims 1, 9 and 14
is described in US-A-3018179
entitled "Pear Peeling, Coring and Trimming Machine and Method and
Product Thereof'. However, the pear processing machine described
therein locates, or attempts to locate, the blossom end of the pear after
the pear has been impaled. The difficulty with such a mechanism is that
locating the blossom end of the pear after it has been impaled is
inherently difficult, requiring a complex mechanism to locate the
blossom end of the pear. That prior art mechamism is both complex
and unreliable. The general terms, the present invention provides
and apparatus and method for efficiently processing pears.The apparatus includes a pear orienting mechanism
which receives singulated pears from a feeder and tumbles the
pears on orienting rolls until the stems are pointing
downwardly. As each pear is properly oriented with its stem
pointing downwardly, it is dropped into a transfer cup having
a secondary mechanism for orienting misaligned pears.
The transfer cup uses a plurality of resilient, spring loaded
fingers wherein a misoriented pear tends to be oriented by one
or more of those fingers.Each pear is discharged from the transfer cup into
a feed cup having a generally concave receptacle for receiving
the stem of the pear and having a plurality of arms extending
upwardly for grasping and centering the blossom or large end 
of the pear. The feed cup in effect offers a third orienting
mechanism for properly aligning and positioning the pear.A pusher and set height mechanism is utilized which
positions the
