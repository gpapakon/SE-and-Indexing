<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for introducing delivered items into (20) a deposit box (1) for these items. The device comprises a chute (10) through which the items are introduced into the box (1), the chute being mounted so as to pivot about a horizontal axis (13) inside the latter between a non-pivoted position in which the items can be introduced into the chute (10) from the front through a front opening (6) in the box (1) and a pivoted position in which said items leave the chute (10) through the rear and fall into a deposit compartment inside the box (1), situated beneath the chute (10). The box (1) and the chute (10) are so shaped that in the pivoted position the chute (10) prevents access into the interior of the box (1) through said front opening (6) and the chute (10) has a rear flap (15) hinged to said chute (10) and connected to the box (1) by means (16) for controlling its opening so that the flap (15) closes the rear of the chute (10) when the latter is not pivoted and opens downwards when the chute (10) is pivoted.
