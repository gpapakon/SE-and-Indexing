<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for speed control of a compressor, particularly a refrigeration compressor, and a control arrangement using this method. The speed control is effected in that a control arrangement varies the speed of an electric motor in dependence of simple ON/OFF signals from a thermostat placed in the surroundings to be cooled. The method according to the invention is characterised in that the starting speed of the compressor in a following ON period is reduced in relation to the final speed in the previous ON period. A continuous reduction of the starting speed of each ON period results in a self-regulating control giving long compressor operation times and an averagely low speed resulting in energy savings. A control arrangement using this method is also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method for speed control of compressor and control arrangement using the methodThe invention concerns a method for speed control of a compressor, particularly a refrigeration compressor, and a control arrangement using this method. The speed control is effected in that a control arrangement varies the speed of an electric motor in dependence of simple ON/OFF signals from a thermostat placed in the surroundings to be cooled.The task on which the application is based, is the development of a control method and a control arrangement for a variable speed compressor, which is simple compared with the state of the art, and which can be fitted into existing constructions, e.g. refrigerators, which normally operated at fixed speed, but which can be changed to operation with variable speed by a quick intervention of a service technician. It is known to control the speed of compressors in dependence of the pressure conditions in the refrigeration system or in dependence of electronic temperature signals, but a common feature of these solutions is that they require relatively expensive pressure and temperature meters, and can only in rare cases directly replace existing solutions .US 5,410,230 describes a compressor control with an ON/OFF thermostat controlling the motor speed on the basis of the cyclic parameter, i.e. the duty cycle. The ON and OFF times of the thermostat are measured, and the duty cycle is calculated. If the duty cycle is lower than a predetermined value, the starting speed in the next cycle is reduced, and if it is higher, the starting speed is increased. When the thermostat is closed and the compressor operates, the motor speed is ramped upwards during the ON period, and corre-CONFIRMAΠQN COPY 

spondingly the motor speed is ramped downwards during theOFF period of the thermostat.The control described in US 5,410,230 is developed with a view to sawing a control component, e.g. a temperature controlling microprocessor, and in stead of having a price increasing component like a microprocessor measure and treat a temperature signal from an electronic thermostat, US 5,410,230 uses a cheaper solution with an ON/OFF thermostat. However, the control method described is relatively complicated, as both ON and OFF times are measured, and at least three speed calculations are made during an ON/OFF cycle, viz. a first calculation of the starting speed, then a second continuous calculation of the speed in the ON period and a third calculation of the speed in the OFF period. Besides, the described method

Patent Claims
1. Method for controlling the motor speed in a compressor with an electronic control arrangement, which, from a thermostat with the states ON or OFF, receives a signal depending on the temperature in the room to be cooled, characterised in that the starting speed in a following ON period is reduced in relation to the final speed in a previous ON period by making the control arrangement (11) subtract a predetermined speed from the final speed in the previous ON period and letting the result of this calculation be the starting speed in the following ON period, through which the speed is either increased or kept constant.
2. Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the control arrangement stores the final speed from the previous ON period in a memory and measures the compressor speed during an actual ON period, deciding on the basis of a comparison of these two speeds, what the speed has to be in the actual or the following ON period.
3. Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the predetermined speed subtracted has a constant value, so that the starting speed in the following ON period is lower than the starting speed in the previous ON period, if the thermostat delivers an OFF signal before the actual compressor speed is equal to the final speed in the previous ON period.
4. Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the speed during an ON period is set at maximum, if the speed change during this ON period exceeds a predeter- 


 mined limit value.
5. Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the speed during an ON period is set at maximum, if the total operation time exceeds a fixed limit value.
6. Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the speed is increased at a first time tl and then again at a second time tl.
7. Method according to claim 6, characterised in that the speed is kept constant at a first speed until the time tl, whereafter the speed is raised and kept constant at a second speed until the time t2, after which the speed is increased according to a ramp.
8. Variable speed control for regulating the motor speed in a refrigeration compressor, in which the variable speed control is carried out by an electronic control arrangement receiving a temperature signal from a thermostat placed in a room to be cooled, and in which the thermostat has the states ON or OFF, characterised in that the control arrangement reduces the starting speed of the motor in the following ON period in relation to the final speed in the previous ON period by subtract
¬
 ing a predetermined speed from the final speed in the previous ON period, and letting the result of this calculation be the starting speed in the following ON period, through which the speed is either increased or kept constant.
9. Method for speed control of the motor in a compressor by means of an electronic control arrangement receiving a temperature signal from a thermostat with the states ON or OFF, and in which the speed determined by the control arrangement is a function of the duration of 


 the ON and/or OFF period, characterised in that the control arrangement reduces the motor speed, if the thermostat breaks before a first time tl, that the motor speed is maintained, if the thermostat breaks after the first time tl but before the second time t2, and that the motor speed is increased, if the thermostat has not broken when reaching the time t2.
10. Method according to claim 8, characterised in that the motor speed is kept constant in the actual ON period and that the change of the motor speed is effected in the following ON period.
