<ABSTRACT>
A resequencing system is used for resequencing the 
cells of a cell stream having different input and output peak 

cell rates and which is conveyed through the series 
connection of : 


an input circuit (IM1) controlled by a first time stamp 
generator (TSG1) and allocating to each cell of the cell 

stream an adapted time stamp value equal to the sum of a time 
stamp value then generated by the first time stamp generator 

(TSG1) and a variable virtual delay, and such that 
consecutive adapted time stamp values allocated to 

immediately consecutive cells differ by a time delay equal to 
at least the inverse of the output peak cell rate; 
a cell switching network (SN); and 
a resequencing unit (RSU1) associated to a second time 
stamp generator (TSG2) generating successive second time 

stamp values at a rate at least equal to the output peak cell 
rate, and resequencing the cells by subjecting them to an 

additional variable time delay which is such that the total 
delay of the cells is equal to the sum of the virtual delay 

allocated thereto and a predetermined constant value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resequencing
system for a cell switching network able to switch an input
cell stream having an input peak cell rate from a network
input to a network output, and including:
a time stamp generator generating successive time stamp
values at a rate at least equal to said input peak cell rate;an input circuit coupled between an inlet to which said
input cell stream is applied and said network input, and
controlled by said time stamp generator; anda resequencing unit coupled between said network output and
an outlet, and submitting the cells of said input cell stream
received on said network output to corresponding delays, thus
providing a resequenced output cell stream at said outlet.Such a resequencing system is already known in the
art, e.g. from the published International Patent Application
PCT/EP89/00941 with publication number WO 91/02419 (Henrion 17). Therein, the input circuit
allocates to each of the cells of the input cell stream the
time stamp value then generated by the time stamp generator,
whilst the resequencing unit queues the cells received on the
network output and applies them to the outlet when a second
time stamp value also generated by the time stamp generator
becomes equal to the sum of the first time stamp value
allocated to the cell and a constant value, thereby making
the total delay to which each cell is submitted between the
network input and the outlet equal to this constant value,
thus resequencing these cells.In a practical implementation the input circuit and
the resequencing unit are part of so-called termination link
(TLK) boards, and more particularly of a TLK input board and
of a TLK output board, respectively, and each such TLK board
includes its own time stamp generator. This implies that the
TLK input and output board time stamp generators have to be
synchronized. Synchronization mechanisms to do so are well-known
in the art and are no object of the invention. Furthermore, it should be noted that these TLK
input and output boards are designed for the specific peak
cell rate of the input and output cell streams, respectively.
Due to technological development, i.e. higher speed
transmission links connected to the TLK board and higher
speed TLK boards and switching networks, this peak cell rate
evolves to higher values. Consequently, switching networks
where the input and output peak cell rates are different
become necessary and in such cases the above resequencing
system is not applicable and a problem in comparing the time
stamp values
