<ABSTRACT>
An optronic panoramic search device contains a first viewfinder (32) for target detection, by means of which viewfinder a field of view (viewing field) can be continuously scanned. A memory (92) serves to store the positions of detected targets. A second viewfinder (36) with a high-resolution sensor (26) can be successively aligned in steps with the stored positions of the detected targets and remains in each of these positions for an observation time. A joint sensor (26) is provided for the first and the second viewfinder (32, 36). Beam-changing means (78) are furthermore provided, by means of which either the beam path of the first viewfinder (32) or the beam path of the second viewfinder (36) is guided onto the sensor (26).

Optronic all-around seeker device comprising a first 
seeker for detecting a target, this seeker being 

adapted to continuously scan an extended, first field 
of view, a second seeker for scanning a second field of 

view limited relative to the first field of view, and a 
high-resolution sensor (26)
characterized by
(a) memory means (92) for storing the positions of the 
targets detected by the first seeker, and 
(b) follow-up means which are controlled by the memory 
means and which are arranged to align the second 

seeker (36), independently of the orientation of 
the first seeker, stepwise, consecutively with the 

stored positions of the detected targets and to 
retain it in each of these positions for an 

observation time. 
Optronic all-around seeker device as claimed in claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 a common sensor (26) is 
provided for the first and second seekers (32,36) and, 

furthermore, beam changing means (78) are provided, by 
which either the path of rays of the first seeker (32) 

or the path of rays of the second seeker (36) is 
directed to the sensor (26).  

 
Optronic all-around seeker device as claimed in claim 
2, 
characterized in that
 the beam changing means are a 
rotating sector mirror (78) by which alternatingly the 

path of rays of the first seeker (32) is passed to the 
sensor (26) or the path of rays of the second sensor 

(36) is reflected onto the sensor. 
Optronic all-around seeker device as claimed in claim 
3, 
characterized in that
 the imaging optical system of 
the second seeker (36) is arranged to be tilted as a 

whole for the alignment with a target, and the sector 
mirror (78) is coupled with the atuator means to be 

tilted about half of the tilting angle of the optical 
system. 
Optronic all-around seeker device as claimed in claim 
4, 
characterized by
a housing (12) rotatable about a common axis (40) 
of the paths of rays of the first and second 

seekers (32,36), the optical system of the second 
seeker (36) being mounted for elevational movement 

in the housing, also the sector mirror (78) being 
tiltably arranged therein, 
a second part (44) rotatably mounted at the housing 
(12) about the optical axis (40) of the seekers 

(32,36), a mirror via which the path of rays of the 

first seeker (32) is directed, being alevationally 
tiltably mounted in this part.
