<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a roller 
device for controlling the unevenness of a sliver from a 
carding machine. A carding machine with a device for controlling 
the unevenness of a sliver in a short cycle is known, 
where the device is arranged at a downstream side of a 
sliver delivery section of a card and is constructed as a 
set of a bottom and top measuring rollers, and a set of 
bottom and top drafting rollers. The measuring rollers 
are capable of being vertically displaced in relation to 
each other in accordance the thickness of a sliver 
passing between the rollers. Furthermore, a system is 
provided for controlling the rotational speed of the 
drafting rollers in accordance with the detected 
thickness of the sliver. As a result, a desired control 
of the drafting ratio (a ratio of the rotational speed of 
the drafting rollers with respect to the measuring 
rollers) is obtained, so as to obtain a sliver of a 
reduced unevenness. In the prior art, as shown in 
Fig. 7, one of the measuring rollers, for example, the 
top measuring roller is constructed as a roller with an 
annular groove, and the bottom measuring roller is 
constructed as a roller with a flange, which engages with 
the groove of the top measuring roller. Such a 
construction of the top and bottom measuring rollers is 
effective for preventing the sliver from being 
excessively widened at the measuring rollers, which is 
effective for reducing the unevenness at the measuring 
rollers. However, in the prior art, the drafting rollers  
 
are a type with no flange and groove. In other words, 
the drafting rollers are constructed from a set of 
rollers of a flat surface. Such a flat construction of 
the drafting rollers causes an irregular drafting 
operation to be taken place, due to the fact that a 
widening of the sliver is not limited when it passes 
between the drafting rollers. Furthermore, in the prior 
art construction, foreign matter such as honeydews are 
apt to be attached to the surfaces of the measuring 
rollers and the drafting rollers, and a separate cleaning 
unit is necessary to clean these honeydews. Furthermore, 
in the prior art, in order to obtain a smooth threading 
of a sliver, a manual operation by an operator is 
essential so that the free end of the sliver is guided to 
the nip point of the drafting rollers. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
roller device for controlling the unevenness of a sliver 
in a carding machine, capable of overcoming the above 
mentioned drawbacks in the prior
