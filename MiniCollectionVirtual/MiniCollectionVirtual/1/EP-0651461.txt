<ABSTRACT>
This antenna with an array of radiating elements has its radiating elements grouped together on reception into two sets of imbricated, solid, parallel, linear sub-arrays (30, 31) oriented along the two horizontal and vertical directions. It includes two beam-forming circuits (32, 33) each receiving the signals of one of the sets of sub-arrays and performing two reduced beam formations, one in the elevation plane, the other in the azimuth plane, and an output circuit (36) delivering, from a non-linear combination: product or convolution of the two signals generated by the beam-forming circuits (32, 33), a reception signal simulating that of an antenna with complete beam formation in the two elevation and azimuth planes.

<CLAIMS>
Antenna with array of radiating elements, characterized
in that its radiating elements are grouped, for

reception, into two sets of parallel linear sub-arrays
(6, 7) pointing in two different directions, and in that

it includes two beam formation circuits (8, 9) each
receiving the signals from one of the sets of linear sub-arrays

(6, 7) and each delivering a reduced-beam-formation
signal, and an output circuit (10) delivering a

reception signal from a nonlinear combination of the two
reduced-beam-formation signals generated by the two beam

formation circuits (8, 9).

including gaps and the missing radiating elements being
fewer in number than the radiating elements present.
Antenna according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it is rarefied, its array of radiating elements

including gaps and the missing radiating elements being
greater in number than the radiating elements present.
Antenna according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that in each set of parallel linear sub-arrays (20, 21),
