<ABSTRACT>
A versatile workbench with supports (2) and a supporting beam (1) comprises at least one screw cramp (4). This cramp has a retaining arm (40) which is free at one end a clamping arm (41) at the other with a threaded rod (42) arranged thereon. The free end of the retaining arm (40) can slide and tilt in a retaining arm guide (5') in the supporting beam (1). Several retaining arm guides (5') may be combined to form a retaining arm rail (5), thus reducing the production cost of the workbench. The workbench is thus suitable not only for supporting panels but also as a small, handy workbench.

A versatile workbench with supports (2), a supporting beam (1) 
and at least one clamping element (4), which has a retaining arm (40) 

with a free end on one side and a clamping arm (41) fixed to the 

other end, the free end of the retaining arm (40) being slidably 
arranged in at least one retaining arm passage (5') in the 

supporting beam (1), characterised in that a threaded rod (42) or 
cam is located on the clamping arm parallel to the retaining arm and 

that the retaining arm (40) is fixable by tilting in said at least one 
retaining arm passage (5') on clamping a workpiece to be machined. 
A versatile workbench according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the supporting beam (1) is provided with a plurality of 

retaining arm passages (5'), which are incorporated in at least one 
reinforced retaining arm passage rail (5), which is fitted to the 

supporting beam (1). 
A versatile workbench according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a reinforcing element (6) is provided in the at least one 

retaining arm passage (5'). 
A versatile workbench according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the retaining arm passage rail (5) is produced from a flat bar 

with pairs of spacers (51) located thereon, the distance between the 
spacers (51) of a pair corresponds to the width of the retaining 

arm (40) of the clamping element (4) to be introduced and the 
spacers (51) engage directly with the supporting beam (1) on the 

side remote from the flat bar (50). 
A versatile workbench according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the retaining arm passage rail (5) is positioned laterally on 

the supporting beam (1).  
 
A versatile workbench according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the retaining arm passage rail (5) is located in a groove in 

the supporting beam (1), in which are located passage holes aligned 
with the retaining arm passages (5') of the rail (5). 
A versatile workbench according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the retaining arm passage rail (5) is formed from two flat 

bars (50) with pairs of spacers (51) located between them, the 
distance between the spacers (51) of a pair corresponding to the 

width of the retaining arm (40) of the clamping element (4) to be 
introduced. 
A versatile workbench according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the retaining arm passage rail (5) is produced from a box 

section (53) in which the retaining arm passages (5') are located. 
A versatile workbench according to claim 5 or 6, characterised 
in that the retaining arm passage rail (5) is made from two parallel 

flat bars (50) with square tube sections (54) held between them and 
whose inside diameters form the retaining arm passage openings (5'). 
A versatile workbench according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the retaining arm passages (5') are arranged vertically and 

horizontally. 
A versatile workbench according to claim 1, characterised in 
that at least one of the supports (2) has at least one retaining 

arm passage (5'). 
A versatile workbench according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the clamping arm (41) is displaceable in a clamping arm guide 

(43) and is fixable by tilting.
