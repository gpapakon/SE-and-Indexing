<ABSTRACT>
A device for monitoring an ethylene oxide sterilisation process 
in which 100% ethylene oxide is utilised as the sterilant, 

comprises wick means which is impregnated with an ethylene 
oxide responsive chemical compound, a quantifier and a pH 

sensitive dye; an ethylene oxide impervious backing strip upon 
which the wick means is mounted; and a cover strip comprising 

an ethylene oxide impervious film. The backing and cover 
strips are adhered to one another, and in intimate contact with 

and sealed to the wick means. At least one of the cover and 
backing strips has a centrally located perforation, through 

which the ethylene oxide sterilant can gain access to the wick 
means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The sterilisation of surgical supplies and parenteral drugs is 
a carefully controlled process. An effective commonly used 
method of sterilisation is by steam under pressure. However, 
many surgical instruments and supplies are adversely affected 
by heat. Sterilisation at high temperatures is not practical 
for such items. An outgrowth of agricultural and industrial fumigation is 
sterilisation utilizing gaseous ethylene oxide. The advantages 
of sterilisation utilizing ethylene oxide include, 
sterilisation at lower temperatures thereby avoiding the 
detrimental effect of elevated temperatures on the goods to be 
sterilized, items to be sterilized can be terminally sterilized 
in their packages, and the equipment required to carry out the 
process is simple. The preferred method of utilizing ethylene oxide in 
sterilisation process has been to dilute the ethylene oxide 
with a gas inert to the ethylene oxide, such as Freon™, a 
fluoro-chloro substituted ethane or CO₂. The Freon selected 
should be a gas at the sterilisation temperature. Generally, 
the concentration of ethylene oxide is about 450 mg.l⁻¹ to about 
1500 mg.l⁻¹, while processing temperatures can range from about 
70 to about 140°F (21 to 60°C). Preferably, where the diluent 
is Freon, the ethylene oxide concentration is about 12 wt.%. in 
the sterilant gas. Where the diluent is CO₂, the concentration 
of ethylene oxide is about 10 wt.%. For such processes, the 
parameters which affect ethylene oxide sterilisation processes 
are exposure time, gas concentration, temperature and humidity. 
For diluted ethylene oxide, relative humidities below 30% 
relative humidity limit the effectiveness of the ethylene oxide 
sterilisation process. High humidities, for example 90% 
relative humidity, also results in inadequate processing.  The classical method for determining whether or not a 
particular sterilisation process has been effective is to 
include in the system exposed to the sterilizing process a 
suitable resistant organism. For ethylene oxide sterilisation 
the organism of choice is spores of Bacillus subtilis var.niger, since these spores exhibit high resistance to ethylene 
oxide. Such a control method suffers from the fact that at 
least several days are required to culture the spores in order 
to confirm the effectiveness of the sterilisation process. 
Additionally, the spores being living organisms, the rate at 
which they are killed is a logarithmic relationship with time, 
resulting in a broad time window between initial and
