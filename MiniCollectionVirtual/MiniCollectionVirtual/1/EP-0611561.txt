<ABSTRACT>
An adjustable gastric banding device (10) for regulating 
the size of a stoma opening in the stomach of a patient 

includes an elongate band (12) having a portion (12a) that 
encircles the stomach so as to limit the food intake by the 

digestive portion of the stomach. The device can be readily 
implanted and removed using laparoscopic procedures. A 

locking element (20) protruding from a location near the 
distal end of the encircling band portion (12a) is inserted 

into a slot (22) formed in a receiving segment (126) at an 
intermediate location along the encircling band portion (12a) 

so as to form a circle or loop of fixed diameter. The 
receiving segment (12b) has a thickness which is greater than 

the thickness of the encircling band portion (12a) and of the 
rear portion (12c) of the band. A movable bolt (30) secures 

the locking element (20) in the slot (22). The bolt (30) can 
be displaced remotely, thus releasing the locking element (20) 

and allowing easy laparoscopic removal of the banding device 
(10). The entire circumference of the stomach encircling band 

portion (12a) is covered by an expandable section (24) in 
contact with the surface of the stomach. The size of the 

stoma opening can be adjusted by injecting into or removing 
fluid from the expandable section (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the
treatment of morbid obesity, and, in particular,
relates to gastric banding devices which encircle a
portion of the stomach to form a stoma opening of
reduced diameter so as to restrict food intake.In the previously known stoma adjustable silicone
gastric banding (SASGB), disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,592,339 (Kuzmak et al.),
an inflatable or expandable section of a
gastric band covers a portion of the circle defined by
the band. The expandable section of the device permits
some adjustment of the size of the stoma opening both
intraoperatively and postoperatively. This device is
simple in construction and enables the desired diameter
of the stoma opening to be maintained. A similar gastric banding
device is disclosed in WO 86/04498. U.S. Patent No.
4,696,288 (Kuzmak et al.)
discloses a calibrating
apparatus which facilitates controlling the size of the
stoma with a gastric band.Even with the ability to adjust the stoma size, it
may still be desirable in given situations, e.g., 
obstruction of the stoma from edema and migration of
the band to remove the band entirely when deflation is
insufficient to relieve the condition. A scheme for
enabling gastric bands to be removed is discussed in
U.S. Patent No. 5,074,868 (Kuzmak).
When a remotely situated
pull cord is retracted, a suture cutting blade severs
sutures securing overlapping portions of the band which
encircle the stomach. Another removable gastric band
device is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,160,338
(Vincent).A laparoscopic gastric band and a method for using
such a band is disclosed in U.S. Serial No. 07/719,123,
filed June 20, 1991, in the name of Lubomyr I. Kuzmak.
Reference is also made to Lubomyr I. Kuzmak, "Stoma
Adjustable Silicone Gastric Banding," Problems in General Surgery,
Volume 9, No. 2, J.B. Lippincott Co., April/June 1992.Although the devices disclosed in the Kuzmak and
Kuzmak at al patents and patent application referred to
above have proven to be successful in practice, some
potential disadvantages remain. For example, the belt-like
band construction of the devices wherein one end
of the band fits through a buckle at the other end can
be difficult to tighten, and bulges are created at the
ends of the inflated or expanded section (caused by the
fact that the expanded section only partially extends 
around the circumference of the band), thereby
resulting in localized compression of the stomach wall.
Further, the parts of the band must be sutured together
when the band is placed at

<CLAIMS>
A gastric banding device (10) for encircling a stomach
(S) to form a restricted stoma opening in the stomach (S)

so as to restrict food intake to a lower digestive portion
thereof, said device (10) comprising:


a band member (12) including a band portion (12a) for
encircling the stomach (S) so as to form the restricted

stoma opening, the band portion (12a) having a free end,
wherein the band member (12) further includes an expandable

section (24) secured to the band portion (12a) 
and comprising an elongate

inflatable member (24) extending completely along the band
portion (12a) such that the expandable section (24) fully

encircles the stomach (S) when the device (10) is in place
forming the restricted stoma opening; and being

characterised by 
a first interlocking securing means (20) disposed at a
first predetermined fixed position on the band portion

(12a) close to said free end, and a second interlocking
securing means (22) disposed at a second predetermined

fixed position located in an intermediate portion (12b) of
the band member (12) for interlocking with the first

interlocking securing means (20) to provide securing of the
