<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the general area of
medical genetics. More specifically, it relates to the
identification of a new gene--the ataxia-telangiectasia group
D gene--the ATDC gene.Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) is a human autosomal
recessive disease that exhibits progressive neuromuscular
problems, immunodeficiencies, a high incidence of
lymphoreticular cancer, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation
[Taylor, "Cytogenetics of ataxia telangiectasia," IN: Bridges
and Harnden (eds.) Ataxia-telangiectasia--a cellular and
molecular link between cancer, neuropathology and immune
deficiency, pp. 53-82 (Wiley, Chichester 1988); Boder, "Ataxia
telangiectasia an overview," IN: Gatti and Swift (eds.),
Ataxia telangiectasia: genetics, neuropathology and
immunology of a degenerative disease of childhood, pp. 1-63
(Alan R. Liss; New York, 1985); and Morrell et al., J. Natl.
Cancer Inst.. 77: 89-92 (1986)]. AT heterozygotes, which
constitute as much as 3% of the human population, have been
reported to have an increased risk of cancer after exposure to
ionizing radiation.Cells from patients with AT display two hallmark
characteristics: hypersensitivity to the killing effects of
ionizing radiation [Taylor et al., Nature. 258: 427-429
(1975)] and resistance to the inhibiting effects of ionizing
radiation on the rate of DNA synthesis, that is, 
radioresistant DNA synthesis [Young and Painter, Hum. Genet.,82: 113-117 (1989)]. Thus, the identification of genes that
are responsible for those abnormalities would greatly further
the understanding of human radiosensitivity and the regulation
of DNA replication after radiation-induced DNA damage. The
characteristic of AT cells to exhibit radioresistant DNA
synthesis has been used to establish the presence of several
complementation groups within this disease [Jaspers and
Bootsma, PNAS (USA), 79: 2641-2644 (1982); Murnane and
Painter, PNAS (USA), 79: 1960-1963 (1982); Jaspers et al.,
Cytogenet. Cell Genet., 49: 259-263 (1988)].Despite extensive investigation, the underlying
defects responsible for the pleiotropic abnormalities
presented by AT remain unknown. Genetic linkage analysis
[Gatti et al., Nature, 336: 577-580 (1988); McConville et
al., Nucl. Acids Res., 18: 4335-4343 (1990a); McConville et
al., Hum. Genet., 85: 215-220 (1990b); Sanal et al., Am. J.
Hum. Genet., 47: 860-866 (1990); and Ziv et al., Genomics, 9:
373-375 (1991)] and chromosome transfer studies [Lambert et
al., PNAS (USA), 88: 5907-5911 (1991)] have shown that the
gene(s) associated with three
