<ABSTRACT>
Electrical consumers (L1-Ln) are disconnected by referring to a motor vehicle's current operating situation and the state of its electrical supply. Under various operating situations different disconnection priorities are assigned to the electrical consumers. The different disconnection priorities can be stored in a memory (M). To detect the current operating state, a control device (P) receives data signals (D), containing information on the state of the weather and more about the context characterizing the motor vehicle's operating situation.

Method for reducing the loading of a motor vehicle electrical system, with individual electrical loads being switched off, taking into account switch-off priorities which are assigned to the loads, or being supplied with less power, taking into account switch-off priorities which are assigned to the loads, if the vehicle electrical system is in a critical state, with the respectively current operating situation being assessed and switch-off priorities which are dependent on the operating situation being assigned to the electrical loads (L
1
 to L
n
), with information about the surroundings and/or vehicle operating information being evaluated for the purpose of assessing the respectively current operating situation,
characterized in that

safety-relevant and comfort-relevant criteria are taken into account for the switch-off priorities, with the comfort-relevant criterion taken into account being the ability to perceive the function of an electrical load, and the ability to perceive an electrical seat heater being classified as low and a high switch-off priority being assigned to this electrical load when the interior temperature and/or ambient temperature are/is high, whereas the ability to perceive the electrical seat heater is classified as high and a low switch-off priority is assigned to the said seat heater when the interior temperature and/or ambient temperature are/is very low.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
, for each possible operating situation, a specific switch-off priority is provided for each electrical load (L
1
 to L
n
) which can be switched off.
Method according to either of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the weather situation is detected and electrical loads which are in the form of heating elements are assigned switch-off priorities as a function of the existing weather situation.
Control device for carrying out the method according to one of the preceding claims, which control device comprises a controller (P) for taking into account the state of the vehicle electrical system, and switching means (S
1
 to S
n
), which can be controlled by the controller (P), for switching the electrical loads (L
1
 to L
n
) on and off, with the controller (P) receiving information about the current state of the vehicle electrical system, 
characterized in that
 the controller (P) receives data signals about the current operating situation, and derives individual switch-off priorities for different electrical loads (L
1
 to L
n
) as a function of these data signals, and actuates the switching means (S
1
 to S
n
) to switch off the electrical loads (L
1
 to L
n
) in accordance with the switch-off priorities when the vehicle electrical system is in a critical state, with information about the surroundings and/or vehicle operating information being evaluated for the purpose of assessing the respectively current operating situation, and safety-relevant and comfort-relevant criteria being taken into account for the switch-off priorities, with the comfort-relevant criterion taken into account being the ability to perceive the function of an electrical load, and the ability to perceive an electrical seat heater being classified as low and a high switch-off priority being assigned to this electrical load when the interior temperature and/or
 ambient temperature are/is high, whereas the ability to perceive the electrical seat heater is classified as high and a low switch-off priority is assigned to the said seat heater when the interior temperature and/or ambient temperature are/is very low.
Control device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 switch-off priorities which are associated with different operating situations are stored in a memory (M) for each electrical load (L
1
 to L
n
) which can be switched off, the controller (P) calling up these switch-off priorities when the vehicle electrical system is in a critical state and evaluating them to determine the switch-off sequence and/or switch-off time.
