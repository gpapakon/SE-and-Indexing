<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container composed
of a saturated polyester resin composition, and more
particularly to a container composed of a saturated
polyester resin composition excellent in low-temperature
impact strength, rigidity, weld strength, weathering
resistance and fade resistance.Of various thermoplastic resins, a saturated polyester
such as polyethylene terephthalate is excellent especially
in mechanical strength and heat resistance.With respect to uses of such saturated polyester, it
is not curious that the saturated polyester is molded into
containers, pallets, etc. by means of, for example,
injection molding.However, the containers composed of the saturated
polyester are poor in low-temperature impact strength, and
there is involved such a problem that they are greatly
reduced in the low-temperature impact strength especially
when crystallized.Further, the containers composed of the saturated
polyester are sometimes lowered in the mechanical strength 
as compared with the strength just after the preparation,
if they are used outdoors for a long period of time.The present invention has been made under such
circumstances as mentioned above, and it is an object of
the invention to provide a container composed of a
saturated polyester resin composition excellent in low-temperature
impact strength, weathering resistance and fade
resistance as well as rigidity and weld strength.The container according to the invention is composed
of a saturated polyester resin composition comprising:
[A] a saturated polyester which is derived from a
dicarboxylic acid containing a terephthalic acid and a diol
containing ethylene glycol and has an intrinsic viscosity
[η] measured in o-chlorophenol at 25°C
of 0.5 to 1.4 dl/g, in an amount of 50 to 95 parts by
weight;[B] a metallic salt of an ethylene/unsaturated
carboxylic acid copolymer in an amount of 0.5 to 20 parts
by weight;[C] a modified ethylene/α-olefin copolymer rubber
obtained by graft modifying an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer
rubber with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or its
derivative, in an amount of 0.5 to 30 parts by weight;[D] a benzotriazole weathering stabilizer in an
amount of 0.01 to 2.0 parts by weight based on 100 parts by 
weight of the total amounts of the components [A], [B] and
[C];[E] a hindered amine weathering stabilizer in an
amount of 0 to 2.0 parts by weight based on 100 parts by
weight of the total amounts of the components [A], [B] and
[C]; and if necessary[F] a carbodiimide compound in an amount of 0.01 to
5.0 parts by
