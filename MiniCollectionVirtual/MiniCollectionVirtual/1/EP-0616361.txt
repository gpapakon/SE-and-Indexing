<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing defect enhanced CoSi2 formation and 
improved silicided junctions in deep submicron MOSFETs. A silicon 

wafer having a diffusion window is first precleaned with 
hydrofluoric acid. After the HF precleaning, the silicon wafer is 

transferred to a conventional cobalt sputtering tool where it is 
sputter cleaned by bombardment with low energy Ar+ ions so as to 

form an ultra-shallow damage region (7). After the sputter cleaning, 
and without removing the wafer from the sputtering tool, Cobalt 

metal (4) is deposited on the silicon wafer at room temperature and a 
CoSi2 layer is formed in the diffusion window.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved method of forming
semiconductor integrated circuit devices and more particularly to
an improved method of forming silicided junctions as part of such
devices.Silicides provide low sheet and contact resistance in deep
sub-micron MOSFETs (MOSFETS having junction depths smaller than
150 nm (1500 Angstroms)). Self-aligned silicide processes are useful in
deep sub-micron MOSFETS. The drive-in of dopants from silicides
also lowers the generation of defect induced junction leakage
current.The silicide formation at the silicon surface is determined by
the properties of the metal/silicon interface. The deposition of
highly pure metal and a clean surface are required for silicide
reaction. Any residues or contaminants lead to non-uniform and
rough silicide layers.The process of integration requires the formation of a stable
silicide phase. Metastable silicide layers may interfere with
adjacent layers and influence the performance of the devices. The
mechanism of the silicide formation and the thermal budget of the
integrated process determine the grain size of the cobalt
silicides. A high surface energy of cobalt silicide grains leads
to an agglomeration of large silicide grains during the annealing
process. The grains may even penetrate the diffusion layer.
Eventually, an epitaxial regrowth of silicon between the silicide
grains degrades the silicide layers. Leakage currents of such
silicided junctions are increased by some orders of magnitude.Conventionally, the cleaning of the silicon surface is
performed with hydrofluoric acid (HF) prior to the metal 
deposition. The thermodynamically stable CoSi2 phase is formed at
an annealing temperature of 750 degrees Celsius (30 seconds, rapid
thermal annealing RTA) via the Co2Si and CoSi phases. This results
in a rough suicide/silicon interface. Further processing, such as
ion implantation into the silicide, can lead to damage of the
silicon crystal if the suicide film is pulled off the corner of the
diffusion windows. The large grains agglomerate at higher
annealing temperatures, i.e. during the drive-in of the dopants.Neither an HF dip, and HF bath or HF spraying procedure
guarantee a uniformly clean silicon surface in diffusion windows
(adhesion, surface energy). Cleaning the corners of diffusion
windows efficiently is especially problematic. The disadvantages
are rough silicide/silicon interfaces and highly stressed silicide
layers which will often lead to heavy agglomeration, layer
degradation and leaky junctions.A method of
