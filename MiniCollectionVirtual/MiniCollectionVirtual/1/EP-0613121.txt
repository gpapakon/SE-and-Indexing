<ABSTRACT>
The present invention mounts a contact recording 
transducer/suspension assembly over a magnetic recording disk such that 

the rotation of the disk creates an additional dynamic loading to 
counteract the lift-off forces generated by rotation of the disk. As the 

rotation rate of the disk is increased and lift-off forces grow, so do 
the offsetting dynamic loads created by the transducer/suspension 

assembly. Optionally, the cross section of the transducer/suspension 
assembly is modified to further improve this dynamic loading effect. 
The present invention mounts the transducer/suspension assembly in 
a contact recoding disk file so as to place the assembly in compression 

once disk rotation is initiated. The assembly is mounted so that the 
frictional force between the assembly and the disk "pushes" the assembly 

against its mounting instead of applying a "pulling" force on the 
assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to rotating magnetic storage devices 
and their recording elements. Conventional magnetic disk drives are information storage devices 
which utilize at least one rotatable magnetic media disk with concentric 
data tracks, a read/write transducer for reading the data from or writing 
the data to the various tracks, an air bearing slider for holding the 
transducer adjacent to the track generally in a flying mode above the 
media, a suspension for resiliently holding the slider and the transducer 
over the data tracks, and a positioning actuator connected to the 
transducer/suspension combination for moving the transducer across the 
media to the desired data track and maintaining the transducer over the 
data track during a read or a write operation. The suspension is required to maintain the transducer and the 
slider adjacent to the data surface of the disk with a low controlled 
loading force. The actuator positions the transducer over the correct 
track according to the data desired on a read operation or to the correct 
track for placement of the data during a write operation. The actuator 
positions the transducer over the correct track by shifting the 
transducer/suspension combination generally transverse to the track. The air bearing slider supports the transducer above the disk with 
a cushion of air that is generated by the rotating disk. Because the 
recording density of a magnetic disk drive is limited by the height of 
this air cushion between the transducer and the media, a goal of air 
bearing slider design is to "fly" the slider as close as possible to the 
magnetic media while avoiding physical impact with the media. Alternatively, the transducer may operate in contact with the disk. 
Touching the media presents unique problems in wear and, during operation 
of the disk file, the possibility of a catastrophic impact between the 
transducer and an asperity on the media. To minimize these problems, it 
has been recognized that the loading force on the suspension system must 
be reduced to a low level. A variety of mechanisms have been disclosed 
which attempt to implement such a contact recording disk file. 
Structured to work in a perpendicular recording environment, these 
devices permit the head and suspension to be easily manufactured. U.S.
