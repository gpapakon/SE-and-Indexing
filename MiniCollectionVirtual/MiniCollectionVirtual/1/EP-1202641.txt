<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a liquid food composition in the form of a suspension of particles of foodstuff in a carrier liquid, excluding sugar-in-oil suspensions and nut pastes and nut butters; the particles having a mean particle size of less than 100 micrometres and a particle size distribution whereby the d[0.5] value is less than 100 micrometres and the d[0.9]
 value is less than 300 micrometres. The food composition can be for example a coating composition for snack foods or a sauce or bread improver composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid suspensions of foodstuffs such as sauces, bread
improver compositions, coating composition for food items, and more particularly to a
flavouring and/or seasoning composition for food items such as snack foods. The invention
also relates to food items coated with the compositions and to methods of preparing and
using the compositions.Snack foods such as potato crisps, corn chips and pork scratchings are usually coated
with a seasoning and/or flavouring composition in order to render the often bland tasting
basic food item palatable. Such coating compositions can consist predominantly of a
seasoning such as salt (e.g. in the case of potato crisps) or can have a more complex
composition.The coating behaviour of suspensions is discussed in the paper by E.R Lang & C.K.
Rha, Journal of Food Science, Vol. 47 (1981), 324-325 which discloses tests carried out on
inter alia sugar-in-oil suspensions. The authors found that suspensions having a sugar
content of 1-30% gave a thicker coating on a glass plate when the sugar was a relatively
coarse granulated sugar (446-463 micrometre diameter particles), but that suspensions having
a sugar content of 60% gave thicker coatings when powdered sugar (22-31 micrometre
diameter) was used.The behaviour of food suspensions is also discussed (although not in a coating sense)
in a number of patents to Procter & Gamble relating to nut pastes, nut spreads and nut
butters, see in particular US-A-5693357, US-A-5518755 and WO-A-96/21364. The
suspensions disclosed in the aforementioned documents, which contain relatively high
concentrations of solids (greater than 50%) and are described as being spreadable, are milled
using a high shear milling technique to give monomodal suspensions having carefully
controlled particle size distributions. EP-A-0 021 483 (also to Procter & Gamble) discloses flavour enhancing
compositions comprising microfine salts having particle sizes of I to 10 microns.US-A-4,375,483 (Procter & Gamble) discloses a flavour-enhancing fat composition
containing salt, lecithin and a hydrophilic fumed silica. The combination of the salt and
lecithin is stated as providing a synergistic improvement of the anti-stick properties of the fat
composition.Coating compositions are typically applied to a food item (e.g. snackfood) by
spraying, tumbling or dipping techniques in which the coating is presented as a suspension or
powder. A substantial problem with present coatings is that they are often poorly adherent to
the food substrate with the
