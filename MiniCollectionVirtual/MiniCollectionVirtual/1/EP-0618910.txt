<ABSTRACT>
The pH controlled selectivity of the sulfomethylation reaction is used to prepare a series of di-, tri-, tetra- and hexaazacyclomacrocycles with specified patterns of pendent side-chain chelating groups. The prepared mono and diacetic acid derivatives, together with monomethylenephosphonate and monomethylenephosphinate derivatives of [12]aneN4, [12]
aneN3 and [9]aneN3, make these types of ligands easily available by a synthetic pathway that avoids the use of protective groups. The invention thus comprises a variety of compounds, methods and uses characterized by relatively high synthetic yields of polyazamacrocyclic ligands exhibiting a wide and predictable choice of metal ion binding constants and water and lipid solubilities by reason of their substituent pendent groups.

(Inorg. Chem. ) ; Polikarpou et al . ; Delgado et al . ) , phosphonate monoester, and phosphinate side-chains have lead to30 considerable interest in their use as NMR shift reagents in biological systems or as magnetic resonance imaging r_ (MRI) contrast agents (Lauffer) . A new application for the tri- and tetraaza macrocycle derivatives having phosphorous-containing pendent groups is for noninvasive35 in vivo monitoring of intracellular concentrations of free Ca(II), Mg(II), and Zn(II) by 31P NMR (Ramasamy et al . ) . 

 In most cases, this application will require fine tuning of the binding constant under physiological conditions for a particular metal ion, keeping it in the same range as the free metal ion concentration in the cell, to achieve the desired equal concentrations of free ligand and metal ion complex.One method of fine tuning is to introduce two or more different pendent groups onto the macrocycle, but the synthesis of polyazamacrocycles with specific numbers of even a single pendent N-substituent group (acetic acid, for example) has proven difficult with prior art methods (Neves et al. } Tweedle et al . ; Kruper; Dischino et al; Studer et al . ) . Yields of diacetic acid derivatives prepared as in the prior art, with specified pendent group. istributions, have been poor. Such conventional synthetic methods produce mixtures of the desired product with macrocycles having different pendent group distributions, thus necessitating subsequent separation of the desired species.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to chemical synthetic methods and compounds and complexes derived therefrom. In particular, methods of the present invention improve the yield of polyazamacrocyclic
