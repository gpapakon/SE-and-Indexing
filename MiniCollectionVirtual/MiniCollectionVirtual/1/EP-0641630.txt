<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for monitoring and recording the working cycle of one or more paper handling and cutting machines, machines of this type having at least one saddle for the advance of a paper ream, the saddle position being registered by a measuring or sensor device and being fed to a data processing station. In order to provide a method and a device having the features mentioned at the outset which enable the operator at any time to obtain, in a simple and clear manner, an overview of the current status, of working steps already carried out and still to be carried out, in order to be able to intervene if necessary and, for example, to undertake further, improved planning and, in particular, also to optimise the control program of the machine, it is proposed according to the invention that the saddle position in an at least two-dimensional coordinate system has assigned to it one of these coordinates, while another coordinate is assigned to the time, the position resulting from the two coordinates being reproduced on an essentially flat image surface (for example a screen or a paper web).
