<ABSTRACT>
A process for reducing the amount of residual organic diisocyanate monomer in a polyurethane prepolymer reaction product mixture which comprises distilling the polyurethane prepolymer reaction product mixture in the presence of a combination of at least one inert first solvent with a boiling point below the boiling point of the residual organic diisocyanate monomer and at least one inert second solvent with a boiling point above the boiling point of the residual organic diisocyanate monomer, at a temperature which exceeds the vaporization temperature of the residual organic diisocyanate monomer and which is below the decomposition temperature of the polyurethane prepolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for
removing residual organic diisocyanate monomer from
polyurethane prepolymers.In preparing a polyurethane prepolymer, an organic
diisocyanate monomer is reacted with a polyol, usually
employing a stoichiometric excess of the diisocyanate
monomer(an NCO:OH ratio greater than 1:1, usually about
2:1 or greater). The use of such an excess of
diisocyanate monomer results in an undesirable amount of
unreacted volatile diisocyanate monomer in the prepolymer
reaction product mixture.Several techniques have been described in the art as
useful for reducing the amount of diisocyanate monomer in
the prepolymer reaction product mixture. For example,
British Patent 1,101,410 and U.S. Patent No. 4,182,825
describe a process for distilling the prepolymer reaction
product under vacuum conditions to reduce the amount of
diisocyanate. U.S. Patent No. 4,061,662 describes a
process for the removal of unreacted tolylene
diisocyanate from prepolymers by passing the prepolymer
reaction product through a column containing a molecular
sieve. U.S. Patent No. 4,385,171 describes a method for
the removal of unreacted diisocyanate from polyurethane
prepolymers by codistilling the prepolymer reaction
product with a compound which boils at a temperature
greater than the boiling point of the diisocyanate. U.S.
Patent No. 4,888,442 describes a two-step process
consisting of a first step of distilling the prepolymer
reaction product to remove the bulk of the diisocyanate
and then, in the second step, a solvent is added to the
distilled prepolymer reaction product and the resultant
mixture is passed through an agitated thin-film
evaporator. According to this patent, the vaporization 
temperature of the solvent should be exceeded under the
conditions employed in the thin layer evaporator. U.S.
Patent No. 4,288,577 describes the removal of unreacted
methylene bis(4-phenyl isocyanate) (MDI) via solvent
extraction with hexane.The procedures described above relate to reduction
of such traditional diisocyanate compounds as toluene
diisocyanate (TDI), methylene-bis-(4-phenyl)isocyanate
(MDI), and the like. Other diisocyanate monomers with
high melting points, such as para-phenylene diisocyanate
(PPDI), have not been easily removed from polyurethane
prepolymers using known procedures.It is known that in the distillation of diisocyanate
monomers from polyurethane prepolymers, high temperatures
must be avoided to prevent decomposition reactions in the
prepolymer. For example, British Patent
