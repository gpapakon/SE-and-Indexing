<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and
method for assisting a medical diagnosis by discriminating
attribution degrees for determining to which of multiple
disease groups, test data of a given patient is attributed
through multiple-group discriminant analysis by integrating
the results of two-group linear discriminant analysis. Such
an apparatus and method are useful, for example, for assisting
the diagnosis of diseases (or for assisting the determination
of which of multiple disease groups the patient belongs).The two-group linear discriminant analysis is one of
the most popular methods for statistically determining to
which of two disease group a given patient belongs. The two-group
linear discriminant analysis provides a highly dense
information from the viewpoint of knowledge acquisition
because the two-group linear discriminant analysis allows determining
to which of two disease groups the patient belongs
by determining whether two group-linear discriminant function
assumes a positive value or a negative value.On the other hand, examples of approaches for determining 
one group out of probable multigroups with respect to
given disease data (diagnosis systems) include an approach
represented by an expert system by which the disease group is
determined with coded information of knowledge and an inference
engine, an approach using the learning of a neural network,
and an approach for inductively determining the disease
group in a multiple-group discriminant analysis as an application
of multivariate analyses.A process by which an experienced medical specialist,
for example, selects one disease group from the rest of
multiple disease groups is as follows. The medical specialist
will never select one group at one time, but will rather select
several probable groups from multiple disease groups to
finally select the most probable group through comparison of
the probable groups. In general, this process is referred to
as "preferable selection process" in which humans exhibit a
relatively high ability.With respect to the recognition of multiple group patterns
as mentioned above, the Journal of Electronic
Information and Communications Society A, Vol.J 72-A,
No.1,pp.41-48, Jan., 1989 discloses a multiple group pattern
recognition by pair discrimination.In this multiple group pattern recognition, two groups
are discriminated from each other with respect to all pairs
to produce the discrimination result for multiple groups by
integrating the result of the two group discrimination. The
