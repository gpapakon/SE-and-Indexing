<ABSTRACT>
An image forming machine such as a copying machine and a 
printer for forming an image on a recording medium with plural 

laser beams. The image forming machine includes: an image 
reader for reading an original image and for generating image 

signals corresponding to the original image; plural laser beam 
generators for writing the image on the recording medium 

according to the image signals; an index signal generating 
circuit for generating plural index signals each of which 

initiates respective one of the plural laser beam generators 
to write the image; and a control circuit for controlling a 

reading operation of the image reader. In the image forming 
machine, the control circuit initiates the reading operation 

of the image reader according to one of the plural index 
signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus, and more particularly, to a technology for
synchronizing a reading operation and a recording operation
in an image forming apparatus which is of structure wherein an
image of a document is read through photoelectric conversion,
and information of the read image mentioned above are recorded
by means of a plurality of laser beams modulated based on the
information of the read image.Heretofore, there has been known a copying machine of a
digital type [Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public
Inspection No. 157070/1987 (hereinafter referred to as
Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication)] which is of structure
wherein a document is subjected to optical scanning and
resulted optical images are converted to electric signals by a
photoelectric conversion element such as a line image sensor
that receives the optical images, the electric signals are 
further digitized, and a laser beam is modulated based on
image information of the document converted to the digital
information to form an electrostatic latent image on a
photoreceptor.In a writing unit employing the laser beam mentioned
above, there is provided a sensor (an index sensor) that
detects a laser beam entering a scanning area of the laser
beam, and there are formed synchronization signals (horizontal
synchronization signals or index signals) for controlling the
start of recording by the laser beam based on the detection
signals of the sensor mentioned above. In the writing unit, a
data clock (a writing clock) is created based on the
synchronization signals mentioned above, and the laser beam is
modulated based on the data clock.On the other hand, some writing units employing a laser
beam as that mentioned above are of structure wherein a
plurality of laser beams are used for recording plural lines
simultaneously for the purpose of attaining high speed
recording. In the structure wherein a plurality of laser
beams are used as in the foregoing, when laser beams are
arranged in a line along the subsidiary scanning direction,
there is a limitation for the shortest distance between
adjacent laser beams, which is disadvantageous. In some
structures, therefore, plural laser beams are arranged to be
staggered in the primary scanning direction. In the structure wherein plural laser beams are staggered
in the primary scanning direction as mentioned above, it is
necessary, for avoiding slips in recording positions, that
synchronization signals are set for each laser beam so that
the start of each laser beam
