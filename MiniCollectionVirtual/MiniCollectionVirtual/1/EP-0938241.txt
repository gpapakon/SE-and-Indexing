<ABSTRACT>
A wireless telecommunications system architecture (400) is disclosed
that is capable of supporting a centralized block radio architecture (403) and of

distributing the information-bearing signals from the block radio to geographically-dispersed
radio heads (401-1...401-6) using relatively low-cost cable (402-1...402-3)

(e.g., twisted-pair, etc).
A radio multiplexes, modulates, and channel codes one or more information-bearing

signals and upconverts them, not to radio frequency, but to an intermediate
frequency that can be transmitted over a low-cost cable. Co-located with each radio

head is an upconverter that upconverts the intermediate frequency signal to radio
frequency in preparation for radiation by an antenna.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to telecommunications in general, and, more particularly, to
an architecture for a wireless telecommunications system.FIG. 1 depicts a schematic diagram of a portion of a typical wireless telecommunications
system in the prior art, which system provides wireless telecommunications service to a number
of wireless terminals (e.g., wireless terminals 101-1 through 101-3) that are situated within a
geographic region. The heart of a typical wireless telecommunications system is Wireless
Switching Center ("WSC") 120, which may also be known as a Mobile Switching Center
("MSC") or Mobile Telephone Switching Office ("MTSO"). Typically, Wireless Switching
Center 120 is connected to a plurality of base stations (e.g., base stations 103-1 through 103-5)
that are dispersed throughout the geographic area serviced by the system and to local and long-distance
telephone and data networks (e.g., local-office 130, local-office 138 and toll-office 140).
Wireless Switching Center 120 is responsible for, among other things, establishing and
maintaining calls between wireless terminals and between a wireless terminal and a wireline
terminal (e.g., wireline terminal 150), which is connected to the system via the local and/or long-distance
networks.The geographic area serviced by a wireless telecommunications system is partitioned into
a number of spatially distinct areas called "cells." As depicted in FIG. 1, each cell is
schematically represented by a hexagon; in practice, however, each cell usually has an irregular
shape that depends on the topography of the terrain serviced by the system. Typically, each cell
contains a base station, which comprises the radios and antennas that the base station uses to
communicate with the wireless terminals in that cell and also comprises the transmission
equipment that the base station uses to communicate with Wireless Switching Center 120.For example, when wireless terminal 101-1 desires to communicate with wireless
terminal 101-2, wireless terminal 101-1 transmits the desired information to base station 103-1,
which relays the information to Wireless Switching Center 120 via wireline 102-1. Upon receipt 
of the information, and with the knowledge that it is intended for wireless terminal 101-2,
Wireless Switching Center 120 then returns the information back to base station 103-1, again via
wireline 102-1, which relays the information, via radio, to wireless terminal 101-2.FIG. 2 depicts a block diagram of the architecture of a typical wireless
