<ABSTRACT>
A recombinantly produced L1 major capsid protein which mimics conformational neutralizing epitopes on human and animal papilloma virions is provided. The recombinant proteins are useful as vaccines protective against papillomavirus infection. Antibodies to the recombinant protein are also provided. Such antibodies are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of viral infection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the diagnosis, serotyping, prevention and treatment of viral diseases, particularly papillomavirus infections.Papillomaviruses (PV) are members of the papovavirus family and contain a double stranded circular DNA genome with a typical size of about 7900 base pairs (bp). Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are recognized as a cause of various epithelial lesions such as warts, condylomas and dysplasias. See, Gissman, L. Cancer Survey 3:161 (1984); Boshart et al, ENBO J. 3:1151 (1984); Romanczuk et al, J. Virol. 65:2739-2744 (1991); Jenson et al, In "Papillomaviruses and human cancer" (H. Pfister. Ed.), pp. 11-43, CRC Press (1990); Schlegel, R., "Papillomaviruses and human cancer" In: Viral pathogenesis (ed. Fujinami, R.), Seminars in Virology 1:297-306 (1990); and Jenson et al, "Human Papillomaviruses" In Belshe, R. ed. Textbook of human virology, Second Edition: MASS:PSG, 1989:951.HPVs are grouped into types based on the similarity of their DNA sequence. Two HPVs are taxonomically classified as being of the same type if their DNAs cross-hybridize to greater than 50% as measured by hybridization in solution under moderately stringent hybridization conditions.A number of distinct papillomaviruses have been shown to infect humans. Papillomaviruses are highly species and tissue-specific, and are characterized by a specific mode of interaction with the squamous epithelia they infect. These small DNA tumor viruses colonize various stratified epithelia like skin and oral and genital mucosa, and induce the formation of self-limiting benign tumors known as papillomas (warts) or condylomas. These tumors are believed to arise from an initial event in the infectious cycle where the virus enhances the division rate of the infected stem cell in the epithelial basal layer, before it is replicated in the differentiating keratinocyte.The term papillomavirus covers a large number of viruses which are considered responsible for several forms of viral infection ranging from relatively benign waits of the skin or mucous membranes to hyperplasias susceptible to progressing into dysplasias or intra-epithelial neoplasms, and malignant conversion to various forms of cancer, the most significant being that of the female uterine cervix.A number of HPVs types have been identified. Furthermore, the preferential association of certain HPV types with anatomic location and distinct types of lesions gives support to the hypothesis that different HPV-induced lesions constitute distinct diseases, and that the clinical
