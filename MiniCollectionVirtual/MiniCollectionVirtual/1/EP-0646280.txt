<ABSTRACT>
An installation device (1) working with a switch component (2), especially a switch knob, which is reset by a torsion spring (3) contained in a space (4) in the switch component (2) and supported by one end (7) of the spring on the body of the switch component (2) and, when the switch component is moved, by one end (8) of the spring on the body of the installation device or its casing. The space (4) is bounded by a jacket (5) of the component body, especially the switch knob which forms an engagement slot (9) for the end (7) of the spring supported on moving on the switch component (2) in such a way that a supporting edge (10) borders or is inclined upwards and downwards starting from a central position (11). A disappearing engagement recess (13) is formed below on the supporting base (12) for the torsion spring (3) and the upper side of the engagement slot (9) forms a further engagement recess (14) of one of the ends (end 8) of the torsion spring (3) after a certain sector to tension the spring.

Switching element (2) which operates in 
particular with an operating handle which is reset by 

means of a torsion spring (3) contained in a receiving 
space (4) in the switching element (2), which torsion 

spring is supported on the one hand by one spring end 
(7) on the body of the switching element (2) and on the 

other hand, during displacement of the switching 
element, by one spring end (8) on the body of the 

switching element base or of the housing containing the 
switching element (2), 
characterised in that
 the 
receiving space (4) is bounded by a casing (5) of the 

element body, in particular of the operating handle, 
which forms an engagement slot (9) for the spring end 

(7) supported on the switching element (2) during 
displacement, the said slot being formed in such a way 

that a supporting edge (10) slopes or is inclined 
upwards and downwards, starting from a mid-position 

(11), wherein a recessed engagement pocket (13) is 
formed below on the supporting base (12) for the 

torsion spring (3), and wherein the upper side of the 
engagement slot (9) forms a further engagement pocket 

(14), after a sector intended for tensioning the 
torsion spring (3), for one of the spring ends (spring 

end 8) of the torsion spring (3). 
Switching element according to claim 1, 

characterised in that
 the engagement slot (9) on the 
supporting base (12) for the torsion spring (3) turns 

into a supporting surface (15) for one of the spring 
ends (spring end 7), which supporting surface is formed 

outside the casing (5) and has a sloping design, the 
associated spring end (7) being formed bent back in a 

hook shape. 
Switching element according to claim 2, 

characterised in that
 the engagement pocket (14) on the 
upper side of the engagement slot (9) is formed in the  

 
shape of a step. 
Method for mounting a torsion spring in a 
switching element according to one of claims 1 to 3, 


characterised in that
 the torsion spring (3) is 
inserted in a receiving space (4) and is biased by 

means of its upper spring end (8) in the further 
engagement pocket (14) using a rotary motion.
