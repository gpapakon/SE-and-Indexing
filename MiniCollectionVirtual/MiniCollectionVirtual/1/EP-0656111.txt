<ABSTRACT>
The selectivity of response of resistive gas sensors to specific gases or vapours is improved by the selection of specified gas-sensitive materials which are not previously known for the applications described, which include detection of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO, H2S, SO2, chlorine, NO2, CO2 (especially in low concentrations), CFC's, ammonia, free oxygen by determination of partial pressure, and numerous organic gases and vapours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of resistive gas sensors and
the use of sensor arrays
comprising such sensors.Such a sensor, as is well known, comprises, in general
terms, a semiconducting sensing element such that its
electrical resistance changes, in response to a change
in the concentration of at least one gas or vapour
(sometimes referred to as a "target gas") that is
present, to a substantially greater extent than to other
gases or vapours.The sensor is thus selective in favour of the target gas
and is accordingly used for detection, and, where
required, measurement, of the target gas.Such a sensor will be referred to as a sensor of the
kind specified.Semiconducting oxide materials, when used for gas
sensors, provide devices which are inexpensive, light
and robust. However, they suffer a reputation for
unacceptable cross-sensitivity to different gases,
particularly to water vapour, which is always present in
the atmosphere at concentrations which can vary widely.
Devices based on tin dioxide, such as are widely used,
show strong effects of changes in relative humidity,
both on the baseline resistance and on the sensitivity
of the resistance change to the presence of gases such
as carbon monoxide.These devices also have a reputation for excessive 
baseline drift and show a long stabilisation time in the
atmosphere after the temperature of the device has first
been raised to its operating value. The present
invention relates to the use of sensor materials which are
more selective than those in current use, particularly
in respect of the discrimination of changes in the
concentration of the gas to be detected from the effects
of varying relative humidity.A second object of the invention relates to the use of sensor
materials with short stabilisation time and greatly
reduced baseline drift in comparison with those devices
that are currently in common use.A third object of the present invention relates to the use of
sensor materials which offer improved selectivity and
sensitivity for certain gases whose detection in the
environment is of concern,
for example in breathing atmospheres or in the exhaust
gases of combustion, and sensor materials useful for the
measurement of reactive gases such as hydrogen sulphide
in anaerobic atmospheres.A fourth object relates to the use of certain combinations of
sensors utilising different materials which can then be
used, in various ways well known in the art, to provide
more reliable alarm indications for certain conditions
that might be injurious to health and
