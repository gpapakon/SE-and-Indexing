<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for a pulp and paper mill, and methods of acting on liquid effluents produced in the mill, which minimizes the discharge of polluting gaseous and liquid effluents to the environment. Liquid effluents from the bleach plant (12) are concentrated (e.g. evaporated in 29, 30), incinerated (e.g. gasified in 32), leached (33), crystallized (e.g. freeze crystallized in 34) then washed, and then fed to the plant chemical recovery loop (19, etc.). White liquor produced from the recovery boiler (19) melt is fully oxidized and used in place of caustic in the bleach plant. Essentially all sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, caustic, and chlorine dioxide necessary for the pulp mill is produced from mill liquid effluents and gas waste streams, on site at the pulp mill. Typical bleaching sequences that can be used are DEopDnD, or AZEoPZP.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of and an apparatus
for recovering chemicals from the production of
chemical cellulose pulp.It has long been a desire of those working in the
paper pulp art to produce a pulp mill that does not in any
way significantly pollute the environment. A number of
proposals have been made for such a pulp mill in the
past, but the desired goal has yet to be achieved. For
example, a "closed mill" was constructed at Great Lakes
Forest Products, Thunder Bay, Ontario, in the 1970s,
but it was difficult to run the mill closed for extended periods
of time as a result of corrosion problems in the recovery
boiler, and elsewhere, due to chloride buildup.
See "Bleaching in the Closed Cycle Mill at Great Lakes
Forest Products Ltd." by Pattyson et al, Pulp & Paper
Canada, Vol. 82, No. 6, pp. 113-122(1981). In the Great
Lakes mill, bleaching plant effluents were introduced directly
into the chemical recovery loop, as shown schematically
in US-A-4,039,372.More recently, it has been proposed by HPD and
Jaakko Poyry that closing of a pulp mill can be accomplished
by evaporating acid effluent and then returning
the Eo bleach plant effluent to the brown stock washers.
However that approach has yet to be successful, despite
the utilization of inexpensive plastic falling film
evaporators which allow effective evaporation of the
bleaching chemicals, and it is believed unlikely that it
will ultimately be successful because of the buildup of
undesired chemicals due to the introduction of the flow
from the Eo stage back to the brown stock washing
stage.In CA-A-2041536 is taught the production of chemical
pulp by a means that provides partial but not complete
recovery of the bleach plant effluents.According to the present invention, a method and
apparatus are provided which utilize only existing technology,
so that future development of sophisticated additional
equipment or processes is not necessary, which
essentially can reduce the liquid polluting effluents from
a pulp mill to zero, provide only a minimum amount of
solid waste for disposal (and provide the high probability
that such solid waste can be used in an environmentally
acceptable manner), and minimize the production of
gaseous NOx and SOx products, so that the only significant
gaseous pollutant from the pulp mill is carbon dioxide.One of the basic aspects of the present invention
that makes it possible to achieve these beneficial results
is to treat the bleaching effluents completely separately
from the chemical recovery loop until the

<CLAIMS>
A method of recovering chemicals from bleach plant liquid effluents
(27, 28) resulting from the production of chemical cellulose pulp by

concentration of liquid effluents, said method being characterized by the
steps of:

   directly treating the bleach plant effluents
by:


(a) concentrating (29, 30, 31) the bleach plant liquid effluents to
produce a concentrated effluent;
(b) incinerating (32) the concentrated effluent to produce a
residue;
(c) acting on the residue (33, 34) to recover sodium, sulfate
and/or carbonate; and then
(d) using the recovered (19, 22, etc.) sodium sulfate and/or
carbonate in the production of the chemical cellulose pulp.
A method according to Claim 1, further characterized in that the
bleach plant liquid effluents comprise an acid (27) effluent flow and an

alkaline (28) effluent flow, and in that step (a) is practiced to separately
evaporate the acid (29) and alkali (30) flows in initial stages of

evaporation, and to combine them for final stages of evaporation (31). 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, further characterized in that
step (c) is practiced by leaching (33) the residue, and by crystallizing and

washing (34) the leachate from leaching the residue.
A method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the bleach plant
(112) comprises more than two bleaching stages (51-54), with

countercurrent flow of effluent from the last stage toward the first stage;
and further characterized in that step (a) is practiced by evaporating the

bleach plant liquid effluents from just the first two stages (51, 52) of the
bleach plant.
A method according to any preceding claim, further characterized in
that in step (c) the residue is leached (33) to produce a leachate;

pulp mill having a digester (10), bleach plant (12, 112) and recovery boiler
(19), whereby effluents from the cellulose pulp mill are minimised.

a level high enough for incineration;
(g) incinerating the concentrated black liquor in the recovery
boiler (19, 119) to produce a melt;

   and further characterized by the steps of:

(h) producing white liquor (23) and/or substantially sulfur free
NaOH from materials in the recovery loop including from the melt and the

leachate fed to the recovery loop; 
(i) oxidising (25, 26) at least a part of the white liquor; and
(j) using at least a part of the oxidized white liquor in place of
caustic in the bleach plant (12, 112).
A method according to any preceding claim, characterized by the
further steps of: collecting spills (39) of liquid from the pulp mill;

concentrating (41) the collected spills to a concentration level high enough
