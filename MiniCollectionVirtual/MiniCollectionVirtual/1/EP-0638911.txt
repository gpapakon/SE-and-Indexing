<ABSTRACT>
Coil ignition unit for an internal combustion 
engine having a plurality of cylinders, in which both 

the low voltage and high voltage internal connections 
of the ignition coils (A, B) are produced by a printed 

circuit (1) so as to eliminate risks of electrical 
discharges between the high voltage and low voltage 

connections. The unit can advantageously be produced 
simply and cheaply.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coil ignition 
unit for an internal combustion engine comprising 
support means on which ignition transformers are 
mounted each of which is intended to be connected 
to at least one associated spark plug, and each 
comprising a primary winding and a secondary winding 
disposed about an arm of a respective magnetic core or 
circuit. In recent times, the use of ignition systems with 
static electronic distribution, with ignition coils or 
transformers mounted directly on the engine, in the 
vicinity of the associated spark plugs, has become 
more widespread. For this purpose, solutions have been 
proposed in which a single ignition coil is coupled to 
a spark plug or to a pair of spark plugs. According to another type of solution, the 
internal combustion engine is associated with an 
integrated coil ignition unit comprising, in a single 
support casing, a plurality of ignition coils or 
transformers. This integrated unit has a plurality of 
outlets, each of which is coupled to an associated 
spark plug by a respective interconnection device. An ignition unit of this kind is disclosed, for instance, in EP-A-0 458 755. However, this type of integrated ignition unit 
involves difficulties in the production of the  
 
internal connection system both for low and high 
voltage. In particular, the connection between the 
outputs of the high voltage, or secondary, windings 
and the high voltage output paths is critical because 
of the danger of internal discharge in the high 
voltage coil. It is known in the art to produce internal 
connections by flexible conductors and thus with 
installations which may be geometrically inaccurate 
and in any case variable from one component to the 
other. In order to overcome this disadvantage, it is 
proposed that these connections be produced by 
semirigid conductors. However, this solution has the 
disadvantage of requiring the conductors to be 
preformed, which may be a difficult operation. The object of the present invention is to produce 
an integral ignition unit which enables all the above 
disadvantages to be overcome satisfactorily. According to the present invention, this object 
is achieved by an ignition unit having the 
characteristics given in the claims following the 
present description.  
 Further advantages and characteristics will 
become clear from the following detailed description 
given with reference to the appended drawings, 
provided by way of non-limiting example, in which:
