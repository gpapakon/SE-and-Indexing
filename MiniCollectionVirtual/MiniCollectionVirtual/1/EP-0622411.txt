a blend of: 


(A) from about 90 to about 10 % by weight of 
polymethylpentene, wherein the polymethylpentene has a 

molecular weight between from about 200,000 to about 700,000,

about 200 grams/10 minutes; 
(B) from about 10 to about 90 % by weight of 
polypropylene, wherein the polypropylene has a molecular 

weight between from about 150,000 to about 350,000, and a melt 
flow rate between from about 1 gram/10 minutes to about 10 

grams/10 minutes; 
 
   whereby the blend of (A) and (B) has improved elongation 

and improved release properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to release films formed from blends of polymethylpentene and polypropylene.
The invention
further provides a process for producing a release film.Polymethylpentene (PMP) is a polyolefin with high
chemical resistance, good mechanical and electrical
characteristics, and high light transparency. The
advantages of PMP are very low density (at 0.83 g/cm3 the
lightest of all industrial thermoplastics), higher rigidness,
tensile modulus, high use temperature, low surface tension and
transparency comparable to other polyolefins. PMP is
superior to polypropylene at higher temperatures because of
its higher melting and softening point. The impact strength
of PMP is 2-3 times higher than the impact strength of other
thermoplastics with comparable light-transmission
characteristics such as polystyrene and acrylics. Thermal and
chemical resistance provides the basis for PMP applications
including films, filaments, fibers, wire, and cable coating.
PMP is also utilized for film and paper coating with good
release properties.Polymethylpentene (PMP), however, has some disadvantages
which are also typical for release films made from it. These 
disadvantages are relatively low tensile strength (2,000-3,000
psi); relatively low elongation at break (60-120%); higher
price; high notch sensitivity and a decreasing release force
with aging, especially at high temperatures. In the past
there have been a number of attempts to minimize or eliminate
these disadvantages of PMP. Primarily, however, these
attempts have focused on methods to decrease the price and/or
methods to improve the properties of PMP. These methods
generally involve blending PMP with other thermoplastic resins
and/or by adding fillers.Polymethylpentene (PMP) has been blended with other
thermoplastics resulting in formulations with properties which
were comparable to film and sheet made of 100% PMP resin. In
spite of the large amount of work based on blending of PMP
with other thermoplastics including polypropylene (PP) there
is no suggestion of a PMP blend or alloy which allows for a
film with high tensile strength and elongation at break and
improved release properties (lower initial release force at
room temperature if compared to 100% PMP and lower or similar
release force after aging at temperatures higher than the room
temperature). Further, there is no suggestion based on the
properties of polypropylene that the addition of polypropylene
(PP) will improve the elongation, tensile strength, and
release properties of
