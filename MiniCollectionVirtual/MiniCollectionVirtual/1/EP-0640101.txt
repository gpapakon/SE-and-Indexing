<ABSTRACT>
A number of octapeptides were generated from the sequences encoding the 60 kDa Ro/SSA peptide, the La/SSB autoantigen, the 70 kD nuclear ribonucleoprotein (nRNP), and the Sm B/B' polypeptide, which represent linear epitopes for autoantibodies present in the sera of SLE and SS patients. These peptides are useful in solid phase assays for patients characterized by the presence of these autoantibodies, and can be used to categorize patients as to the likelihood of developing certain conditions associated with SLE. The peptides are also potentially useful in treatment of these patients using immobilized peptide to remove autoantibody and to block binding of the autoantibodies with patient molecules reactive with the autoantibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the area of the prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially systemic lupus erythematosus.The United States government has rights in this invention by virtue
of grants from the National Institutes of Health AR39577, AI24717,
AI21568, AI31584 and AR01844, and the Veteran's Administration.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is similar to many other
disorders in which autoantibodies are found and thought to be important in
etiology and pathogenesis. SLE can be grouped with those diseases that
commonly have autoantibodies present but for whom a central role of
autoantibody in pathogenesis leading to clinical expression has yet to be
fully established or accepted. Other such diseases include Sjogren's
syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile onset diabetes mellitus, primary
biliary cirrhosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, inflammatory bowel disease,
and many others.Typically, autoimmune diseases present with a wide array of
symptoms and clinical signs. The production of circulating autoantibodies
to ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) is a unifying characteristic of some
of the rheumatic autoimmune diseases. The most common antigens in SLE
and closely related disorders include: Ro/SSA, La/SSB, nRNP and Sm.
Initially, these antibodies were found using double immunodiffusion, but
more recently sensitive solid phase assays have been developed to
quantitate the autoantibodies.The Ro/SSA RNA-protein particle has been found to be a
constituent of all human cells evaluated to date. Approximately half of
Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients
have anti-Ro/SSA precipitins. Approximately 75% of patients with
subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus or complement component C2 
deficiency with SLE have anti-Ro/SSA precipitins. Over 80% of mothers
of newborns with neonatal lupus dermatitis or complete congenital heart
block have this autoantibody. As many as 5 % of patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, polymyositis, and progressive systemic sclerosis have anti-Ro/SSA,
as reported by R.M. Bernstein, et al., Mol. Biol. Med. 2:105-120
(1984); and J.B. Harley and K.K. Gaither, Autoantibodies. In Rheumatic
Disease Clinics of North American: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 14:1,
43-56 (1988).Autoantibodies to the La/SSB ribonucleoprotein antigen are also
found in patients with SS and SLE, as reported by Alspaugh, et al.,
Arthritis Rheum. 19:216 (1976) and Mattioli, et al., Arthritis Rheum.
17:421 (1974). In addition, these antibodies as reported by Horsfall, et
