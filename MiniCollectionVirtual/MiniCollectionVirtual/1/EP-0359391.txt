<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved 
moisture absorbent pad. A moisture impermeable 

thermoplastic substrate (22,24) includes gas bubbles (28) with 
interstices between the bubbles for moisture absorbent 

material (32). A moisture permeable inner film (34) is adhered to 
portions of the substrate where the gas bubbles are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
absorbent pads, for example absorbent pads for use in 
articles such as disposable diapers and bed pads. More particularly, the present invention relates 
to absorbent pads which are relatively non-squeezable, so 
as to avoid undesirable exudation of liquids absorbed in 
the pad. Typical absorbent pads for use in, for example, 
disposable diapers, consist of first and second surface 
layers, at least one of which is a moisture permeable or 
moisture transmitting surface layer. An absorbent material 
such as ground wood pulp or other cellulosic materials is 
disposed in between these two surface layers. These 
abosrbent pads, disposable diapers, and the like typically 
work well until pressure is applied to the article. When 
this occurs, previously absorbed moisture can be squeezed 
out of the pad, thereby reducing its effectiveness as an 
absorbent article. The present invention reduces this problem by 
providing a product which has absorbency but also resists 
squeezing out of previously absorbed contents. Of interest is U.S. Patent No. 4,248,822 issued 
to Schmidt and disclosing a moisture permeable film 
covering for absorbent material. According to the present invention there is 
provided a moisture absorbent pad including a moisture  
 
impermeable substrate with gas bubbles therein, moisture 
absorbent material between the bubbles and a moisture 
permeable film covering the moisture absorbent material and 
attached to the portions of the substrate where the bubbles 
are formed. More particularly the present invention provides 
a moisture absorbent pad comprising a moisture impermeable 
thermoplastic substrate having a first, outer, film, a 
second film adhered to the first film, and gas bubbles 
entrapped between the first and second films; a moisture 
permeable inner film adhered to the portions of the second 
film of the substrate where the gas bubbles are formed; 
interstices between the gas bubbles in the space between 
the moisture permeable inner film and the second film of 
the substrate; and said interstices containing a moisture 
absorbent material. In another aspect this invention provides a 
method of making a moisture absorbent pad comprising: 
providing a moisture impermeable thermoplastic film: 
shaping a second thermoplastic film; adhering the second 
film to the first film; and thereby forming gas bubbles 
between them; depositing moisture absorbent material in the 
interstices between the gas bubbles; and adhering a 
moisture permeable

1. A moisture absorbent pad including a moisture 
impermeable substrate with gas bubbles therein, moisture 

absorbent material between the bubbles and a moisture 
permeable film covering the moisture absorbent material and 

attached to the portions of the substrate where the bubbles 
are formed. 
2. A moisture absorbent pad comprising: 

a) a moisture impermeable thermoplastic substrate 
comprising: 

i) a first, outer, film, 
ii) a second film adhered to the first film, 

iii) gas bubbles entrapped between the first and 
second films; 
b) A moisture permeable inner film adhered to the 
portions of the second film of the substrate where the gas 

bubbles are formed; 
c) interstices between the gas bubbles in the 
space between the moisture permeable inner film and the 

second film of the substrate; and 
d) said interstices containing a moisture 
absorbent material. 
3. A moisture absorbent pad according to claim 1 
or 2 wherein the gas bubbles are air bubbles. 
4. A moisture absorbent pad according to claim 
1, 2 or 3 wherein the moisture absorbent material includes 

at least one of a cellulosic material and a hydrophilic 
synthetic polymer. 
5. A moisture absorbent pad according to claim 
1, 2, 3 or 4 wherein the gas bubbles are distributed in a 

substantially regular pattern. 
6. A moisture absorbent pad according to any 
preceding claim wherein the gas bubbles are between first 

and second films of the substrate.
