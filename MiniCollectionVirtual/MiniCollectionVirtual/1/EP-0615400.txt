<ABSTRACT>
Gaseous alcohol and steam emanating from food being 
heated are detected by an alcohol sensor (11) and a steam 

sensor (12) respectively. A control circuit (16) obtains 
maximum values V
Amax
 and V
Gmax
 serving as reference values 
from detection voltages generated by the alcohol and steam 

sensors (11, 12). Change rates ΔA (V
A
/V
Amax
) and ΔG 
(V
G
/V
Gmax
) are obtained on the basis of detection voltages 
V
A
 and V
G
 detected a predetermined time (40 seconds, for 
example) after initiation of the heating and a ratio r of 

the change rates is obtained from the expression, 

r=(1-ΔA)/(1-ΔG) 
 
. The control circuit (16) compares a value 

of the ratio r with a threshold set for each kind of food to 
discriminate the kind of the food, thereby setting a 

subsequent heating time to execute the heating. Since the 
ratios r vary largely depending upon presence of an 

alcoholic component contained in the food, the kind of the 
food can be reliably discriminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to microwave ovens
wherein food is heated by means of high-frequency waves, and
more particularly, to such a microwave oven wherein the food
is determined by discrimination of the kind of food on the
basis of data of detected volumes of gaseous alcohol and
steam each emanating from the food and a method of
determining the food, starting from Japanese patent publication
No. 62-123 226.Microwave ovens have been provided with a weight
sensor, a gas sensor and the like, for example. The weight
of food to be heated is detected by the weight sensor and a
volume of steam emanating from the food during the heating
operation is detected by the gas sensor so that detection
data is obtained. Heating conditions for the food are set on
the basis of the detection data, or a degree of the heating
is determined on the basis of the detection data so that an
automatic cooking is executed.The prior art has recently proposed a microwave oven
wherein a volume of gaseous alcohol emanating from the food
is detected so that the kind of the food is determined. A
volume of steam emanating per weight is very small in
different kinds of foods. Accordingly, there are some cases
where the kind of food cannot be determined only on the
basis of detection results of the weight sensor and gas
sensor. Even in these cases, however, a volume of gaseous
alcohol emanating from the food differs from food to food,
so that the volume of gaseous alcohol is detected for the 
purpose of discrimination of the kind of food. For example,
Japanese boiled rice and miso soup are sometimes warmed by
the microwave oven when they become cold. In this case, the
discrimination between the boiled rice and the miso soup is
made on the basis of the detection result that a volume of
gaseous alcohol emanating from the miso soup after
initiation of the heating operation is larger than that of
gaseous alcohol emanating from the boiled rice. More
specifically, the gas sensor detects the volume of gaseous
alcohol emanating from the food being heated a predetermined
time after the initiation of the heating, for example, 40
seconds after that, thereby generating a detection signal.
The detection signal generated by the gas sensor is compared
with a reference value of the sensor output previously set
for discrimination between the boiled rice and the miso soup
so that the kind of food being heated is discriminated
according to the magnitude of the detection signal.Upon discrimination of the kind of food, a heating time
suitable for the food
