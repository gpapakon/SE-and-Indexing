<ABSTRACT>
A free flowing powder composition with a particle size of 800 
µm or less comprising: 


(a) 100 parts by weight of a block copolymer comprising at least 
one poly(monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon) block and at least 

one hydrogenated or unhydrogenated poly(conjugated diene) 
block and having a monovinyl aromatic hydrocarbon content in 

the range of from 10 to 60% by weight based on total weight of 
block copolymer; 
(b) 50 to 200 parts by weight of plasticizing oil; 
(c) 50 to 200 parts by weight of a poly(monovinyl aromatic 
hydrocarbon) block compatible resin; and 
(d) 0.1 to 10% by weight based on total weight of composition of a 
dusting agent. 
Process for the preparation of the above free flowing powder 
composition, comprising first melt blending all components except 

the dusting agent and the blowing agent, if present, followed by 
cooling. The resulting composition is then pelletized or granulated 

and the granules or pellets thus obtained are cryogenically milled. 
Finally, the dusting agent and optionally the blowing agent are 

dry-blended with the powder resulting from the previous step. 
The free flowing powder composition is very useful for obtaining 
homogeneous layers having a smooth surface. These layers can be 

successfully be applied for carpet backings, conveyor belts, bottle 
cap sealants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a free flowing powder
composition, to a process for the preparation thereof and to
the use thereof to prepare homogeneous layers.Up to now rubber latexes are widely used in for instance
the carpet industry as backing for carpets as well as in the
paper and board industry for coating purposes. However, the
use of such rubber latexes, i.e. a dispersion of a
thermoplastic rubber in an organic solvent, are undesired
from an environmental point of view due to the evaporation of
organic solvent and due to the fact that recycling of latexes
is not possible. Hence, there is a need for suitable,
environmentally friendly alternatives for rubber latexes.US-A-3,985,702 discloses a process for producing a free-flowing
particulate mixture comprising
a) forming small particles (f = 1.7 mm; Example) of a
thermoplastic elastomeric block copolymer of styrene and
butadiene;b) forming particles of polystyrene having an average
particle diameter of 0.15-0.75 mm andc) dry blending the block copolymer and the polystyrene
with a plasticizing proportion of a mineral oil.
Fillers (e.g. whitings, silicas etc.) may be added.However, no critical sizes of these fillers were
specified and no reference was made to the use of any dusting
agent. Moreover, there was stated in column 3, lines 18 -
26, that for economic reasons it is preferred to utilize the
largest particle size will give the desired degree of
dispersion in the eventually molded article (footwear
articles). There was further indicated that whereas the size
of the thermoplastic polymer is critical there is more leeway
possible with the particle sizes of the thermoplastic
elastomers.The eventual particles prepared by dry blending can thus
be 
expected to be larger than the component particles.US-A-4,163,031 discloses a powder composition useful for
coating applications comprising a blend of 25 to 90% by weight of
a selectively hydrogenated block copolymer and 75 to 10% by
weight of one or more aromatic melt flow modifiers which are at
least partially hydrogenated to remove the aromatic character
thereof. The block copolymer comprises monovinyl arene endblocks
and at least partially hydrogenated conjugated diene midblock(s)
and has a monovinyl arene content of from 5 to 50% by weight.
The powder composition may further contain up to 8% by weight of
a silicon containing adhesion promoter. US-A-4,163,031 further
discloses a process for preparing such powder composition
comprising the subsequent steps of melt blending the components,
followed by
