<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to techniques for improving the efficiency of feed conversion, growth and yield of meat from ruminant livestock. According to the broadest aspect of this invention there is provided a method of improving the growth rate and modifying the carcass quality of ruminant livestock, which comprises simultaneously feeding to the livestock, protected protein and protected lipid in ratios selected to meet protein and energy requirements favourable to the achievement of desired carcass characteristics.

 Feed ConversionTechnical FieldThis invention relates to techniques for improving the efficiency of feed conversio growth and yield of meat from ruminant livestock.5 Background ArtThe competitiveness of world beef markets is presenting producers with increasin pressures to achieve more efficient feed conversion by animals during the growing an fattening phases of their development. As dietary ingredients account for approximatel 70% of the costs associated with feedlotting of ruminants, small increases in the efficienc * o of feed conversion, growth rate and meat yield can have significant effects on the overa economic profitability of feedlot operations. At the same time, there are wider mark opportunities for producers who are able to manipulate carcass characteristics to me various national preferences.Hitherto, both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of beef production hav - = generally been approached by providing carefully regulated diets based on tradition feedstuff s, and by the adoption of controlled management practices, such as feedlotting It has, however, been recognised since the late 1960s that by feeding proteins or lipid which are protected from degradation in the rumen but available for absorption from th abomasum and lower digestive tract, it is possible to improve wool, meat or mil 20 production, and to modify carcass fat composition, in particular to increase th unsaturated fatty acid content of the fat.US Patent 3 507 662 concerns a feed supplement in which the protein content i primarily protected from rumen degradation by cross-linking with natural tannins. Th specification includes examples showing that the protein is indeed, protected but there i 25 no exemplification of body weight response.US Patent 3 541 204 concerns the encapsulation of biologically active substance such as amino acids, vitamins and drugs with hydrogenated fats to protect them fro rumen degradation. According to one example, finishing steers fed encapsulate methionine over a 10 week period exhibited weight gains which were of the order of 22 o better than those of animals on an unprotected control diet. In another example involvin growing/fattening steers, feeding encapsulated methionine over 30 days resulted in weigh gains approximately 14% better than those of animals on the control diet.Australian Patent 402 712 discloses a supplement in which the protein, by treatmen with an aldehyde, is rendered insoluble in the rumen but soluble in the abomasum. Th 5 invention is particularly directed to

 Feed Conversion
Claims
1. A method of improving the growth rate and modifying the carcass quality of ruminant livestock, which comprises simultaneously (as hereinbefore defined) feeding to ε the livestock, protected (as hereinbefore defined) protein and protected (as hereinbefore defined) lipid in ratios selected to meet protein and energy requirements favourable to the achievement of desired carcass characteristics.
2. A method according to claim 1, wherein the source of both protein and lipid is oil seed (eg. cotton, sunflower, canola). o 3. A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the source of both protein and lipid is animal (eg. casein, tallow, lard).
4. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein the degree of rumen protection (protein) lies in the range 50 to 70%.
5. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the degree of rumen s protection (dietary fats) ranges from 65 to 90%.
6. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the degree of rumen protection (dietary fats) ranges from 75 to 90%.
7. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the ratio of protected protein to protected fat is selected in accordance with the stage of growth and fattening of o the animals.
8. A method according to claim 7, wherein the protected protein and protected lipid are fed in the proportions of about 3: 1 to about 1: 1 for approximately 90 to 100 days for optimum feed conversion, growth rate and carcass yield.
9. A method according to claim 7, wherein the protected protein and protected 5 lipid are fed in the proportions of about 1: 1 to about 1:3 as the body weight of the animal increases from 400kg to 700kg during a 150 day feedlot period.
10. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the animals are fed a supplement which combines a protected protein and a protected lipid.
11. A method according to claim 10, wherein the supplement is fed at the rate of o about 20 % of the total feedlot ration
12. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 11, wherein the animals are fed an oat concentrate ration together with protected protein/Iipid supplements during the growing period.
13. A method according to any one of claims 1 to 12, wherein protected 5 proteϊn/lipid supplements are fed in association with ionophores during the growing phase.
14. A method of improving the growth rate and modifying the carcass quality of ruminant livestock, which comprises simultaneously feeding to the livestock, protected 


 protein and protected lipid in ratios substantially the same as the carcass protein/fat rati indicated in Figure 1.
15. A method of improving the growth rate and modifying the carcass quality ruminant livestock, which comprises simultaneously feeding to the livestock, protecte
. protein and protected, lipid in ratios varying from about 3: 1 to 1: 1 during the growin phase to 1: 1 to 1:3 during the fattening phase.
16. A synergistic composition for improving the growth rate and modifying th carcass quality of ruminant livestock, which comprises protected (as hereinbefore defined protein and protected (as hereinbefore defined) lipid in ratios selected to meet protein an
•
 o energy requirements favourable to the achievement of desired carcass characteristics.
17. Meat and/or other products of ruminant livestock fed in accordance with th method of any one of claims 1 to 15.
