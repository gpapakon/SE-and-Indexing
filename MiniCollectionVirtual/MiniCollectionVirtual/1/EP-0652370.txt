<ABSTRACT>
A durable, single action, variable displacement 
vane
 pump capable of undervane pumping, components 
thereof, and pressure balancing method. The pump 

comprises a cylindrical barstock rotor member 
having large diameter journal ends and central vane 

slots uniformly spaced therearound. The vane slots 
are elongate and have a central vane-supporting 

portion of maximum depth surrounded at each end by 
extension portions having depths which decrease 

axially to the surface of rotor member. The vaned 
rotor is rotatably supported within a unitary cam 

member having opposed faces and a circular bore 
therethrough forming a cam chamber having a 

continuous interior circular cam surface. The cam 
member is pivotably supported relative to the rotor 

to adjust the displacement capacity of the pump by 
means of a fluid pressure-powered adjustment 

system. The vane slot extensions in the rotor 
project outwardly beyond the cam chamber. An 

opposed pair of manifold bearings rotatably support 
the journal ends of the rotor and overlap the vane 

slot extensions to admit fluid to expanding vane 
bucket areas of the rotating vaned rotor and also 

into the vane slot extensions and undervane areas 
for pressure balancing purposes. The vane slot 

extensions also permit discharge of pressurized 
fluid from contracting vane bucket areas, and from 

undervane areas as the vanes are depressed into the 
vane slots, to increase the displacement capacity 

of the pump. Fluid passages and pressures within 
the pump are arranged to balance forces acting on  

 
various parts to reduce stress, improve sealing, 

and permit sharing of a fluid pressure source.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to single acting,
variable displacement fluid pressure vane pumps and
motors, such as fuel and hydraulic control pumps
and motors for aircraft use, component parts
thereof and to a method for balancing fluid
pressures.Over the years, the standard of the commercial
aviation gas turbine industry for main engine fuel
pumps has been a single element, pressure-loaded,
involute gear stage charged with a centrifugal
boost stage. Such gear pumps are simple and
extremely durable, although heavy and inefficient.
However, such gear pumps are fixed displacement
pumps which deliver uniform amounts of fluid, such
as fuel, under all operating conditions. Certain
operating conditions require different volumes of
liquid, and it is desirable and/or necessary to
vary the liquid supply, by means such as bypass
systems which can cause overheating of the fuel or
hydraulic fluid and which require heat transfer
cooling components that add to the cost and the
weight of the system.Vane pumps and systems have been developed in order
to overcome some of the deficiencies of gear pumps,
and reference is made to the following U.S. Patents
for their disclosures of several such pumps and
systems: 4,247,263; 4,354,809; 4,529,361 and
4,711,619.Vane pumps comprise a rotor element machined with
slots supporting radially-movable vane elements,
mounted within a cam member and manifold having
fluid inlet and outlet ports in the cam surface
through which the fluid is fed radially to the
inlet areas or buckets of the rotor surface for
compression and from the outlet areas or buckets of
the rotor surface as pressurized fluid.Vane pumps that are required to operate at high
speeds and pressures preferably employ
hydrostatically (pressure) balanced vanes for
maintaining vane contact with the cam surface in
seal arcs and for minimizing frictional wear. Such
pumps may also include rounded vane tips to reduce
vane-to-cam surface stresses. US-A-3 153 384 discloses a vane pump which comprises a rotor member with
a central vane section comprising a plurality of radial vane slots uniformly
spaced around the central circumference. Into each vane slot a vane element
is slidably engaged wherein each vane element extends substantially over the
whole axial extent of the corresponding vane slot. The vane slots extend over
the whole axial length of a cam member wherein a circular bore of the cam
member provides a continuous interior cam surface which is supported axially
and non-concentrically with respect to the central vane
