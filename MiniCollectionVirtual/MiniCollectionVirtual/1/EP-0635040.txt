<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions
and methods for encapsulating biologics such as biologically
active materials, especially mammalian cells, or diagnostic markers. More
specifically, the present invention relates to an ionically
and covalently photocrosslinked biocompatible material
which provides a non-cytotoxic, immunoprotective barrier
for a biologic, including a xenotransplanted biologic. In
another aspect, the present invention relates to a mixture
of an ionically crosslinkable component and a covalently
photocrosslinkable component, suitable for use in encapsulating
mammalian cells. The present invention also relates to processes
for encapsulating biologics with the crosslinked
biocompatible material.Many biocompatible materials such as lipids,
polycations, and polysaccharides, such as hyaluronic acid,
have been used to encapsulate materials such as living
cells and tissue. For instance, the polysaccharide
alginate has been used for the encapsulation, immunoisolation,
and immobilization of cells. The combination
of alginate with multivalent cations, such as calcium, can
form mechanically stable, ionically crosslinked microencapsules.
However, when used in a physiological environment,
such as in the transplantation of microencapsulated
islets or cells, the mechanical stability of the ionically
crosslinked alginate microcapsules will erode since the
extracellular concentration of monovalent cations exceeds
the concentration of the divalent calcium cations,
resulting in the exchange by diffusion of the monovalent
and divalent cations.Attempts to chemically modify alginate microcapsules
or gels by utilizing covalent crosslinking rather 
than ionic crosslinking have been made in order to improve
mechanical stability. However, the reagents and reaction
conditions involved with these techniques often prove
toxic and even fatal to the encapsulated materials. In
order to further improve mechanical stability, covalently
modified alginates have been photopolymerized to produce
covalently crosslinked alginate gels. The rapid photopolymerization
or photocrosslinking of the alginate avoids
the exposure of the encapsulated materials to the toxic
species that are present during the above-described
processes.It has also been found that implanted alginate
gels having higher fractions of α-L-guluronic acid (G
blocks) are more biocompatible than those containing a
larger fraction of β-D-mannuronic acid (M blocks), since
they do not induce a cytokine response from monocytes.
