<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a card processing device
including a reader and writer for data on magnetic cards.To accurately process data on a card (i.e. to read and
write magnetically encoded data on the card) while that
card is being conveyed along a course, one must produce
clock signals to serve as a reference for the timing of
processing operations based on the displacement of the card
as it is conveyed.Existing card processing devices have an encoder
provided either on the rotating shaft of the motor which
generates the force to convey the card, or on a rotating
member of the mechanism which transmits the motor's
rotation to the card. The motor is controlled for constant
velocity based on pulse signals outputted by this encoder.
These signals are also used as clock signals for the
reading and writing of data.An existing card processing device is pictured in Fig.
21. This device has three sets of paired conveyor rollers
201(a-c). The route the card follows is located between
these pairs of rollers. Magnetic head 202, which is
mounted on the shaft of the central pair of rollers 201a
processes the data on the card. During data processing,
conveyance force is applied to the card only by rollers
201a, as it is crucial to prevent changes in the speed of
the card that might occur as forward rollers 201b stop
supplying conveying force and rear rollers 201c begin
supply conveying force.Existing card processing devices do not detect the 
displacement of the card along the route of conveyance in
a way which is directly dependent on the movement of the
card. The dimensional accuracy of the gears, cogged belts
and pulleys constituting the transmission mechanism have an
effect on the detection signal produced by the encoder, as
would the stretching or slipping of the belts over time.
The linear relationship between the rotational velocity of
the encoder and the velocity at which a card is conveyed
can be affected, and the device would no longer be able to
generate a clock signal in good enough conformity with the
true displacement of the card to allow it to serve as a
reference to perform processing.Because the existing card processing devices have
three sets of rollers, their construction tends to be
complicated, and such devices cannot easily be made
smaller, nor can their cost be reduced.An existing card processing device according to the
preamble of claim 1 is shown in Figure 12(c).A card processing device with one pair of rollers for
moving a magnetic card to be read by a magnetic head is
known from
