<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metal window sill (1;15) with a rear on-edge portion (4;17) which is designed as a profile part and is intended for fastening the window sill (1;15) on a corresponding building part (3). In order to ensure in a simple manner that, after its mounting, the window sill (1;15) can change in terms of its length on the corresponding building part (3), even in the event of large temperature fluctuations, without the window frame (3) and masonrywork, etc. being damaged, it is proposed to connect in a positively locking manner the on-edge portion (4;17) on a separate, rail-like profile part (fastening rail) (2;16) fastened to the building part (3), the on-edge portion (4;17) being arranged such that it can be displaced in the longitudinal direction (100) with respect to the fastening rail (2;16).

A sill of metal with a rear edging (4;17), constructed 
as a section piece, for the securing of the sill (1;15) to 

a corresponding building part (3), the edging (4;17) being 
connectable in a form-fitting manner to a separate rail-shaped 

section piece (securing rail) (2;16) which is to be 
secured to the building part (3), and is arranged so as to 

be displaceable with respect to the securing rail (2;16) in 
longitudinal direction (100), characterised by the features: 


a) both the edging (4;17) and also the securing rail 
(2;16) have approximately U-shaped sections; 
b) the two shanks (5,6; 18,19) of the edging (4;17) 
embrace the corresponding shanks (7,8; 20,21) of the 

securing rail (2;16), so that the edging (4;17) and securing 
rail (2;16) form a hollow body; 
c) the upper shank (7;20) of the securing rail (2;16) has 
a groove-shaped recess (9;22) with a cross-section having 

the shape of a circular arc, into which a corresponding 
section rail (11;23) of the upper shank (5;18) of the edging 

(4;17) engages in a form-fitting manner. 
The sill according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the lower shank (8) of the securing rail (2) has a groove-shaped 

recess (10) with a cross-section having the shape of 
a circular arc, into which a corresponding section rail 

(12), having the shape of a circular arc, of the lower shank 
(6) of the edging (4) engages in a form-fitting manner (Fig. 

1). 
The sill according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the lower shank (21) of the securing rail (16) and the lower 

shank (19) of the edging (17) are connected with each other 
by a sawtooth-shaped detent connection (24) (Fig. 3).  

 
The sill according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the dimensions of the shanks (5,6; 

18,19) of the edging (4;17) are selected such that the 
section rail (11;23) of the edging (4;17) is insertable from 

above into the corresponding groove-shaped recess (9;22) of 
the securing rail (2;16) and then the sill (1;15) is able to 

be swivelled downwards until the lower shanks (6,8; 19,21) 
are connected with each other in a form-fitting manner. 
The sill according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a seal (27) is arranged between the 

securing rail (16) and the building part (3), the upper end 
(28) of which seal (27) partially overlaps the upper shank 

(18) of the edging (17). 
The sill according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the securing rail (2;16) has oblong 

holes (14) through which screws (13) are passed for securing 
the securing rail (2). 
The sill according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the wall thicknesses of the shanks 

(5,6; 18,19; 7,8; 20,21) of the edging (4,17) and af the 
securing rail (2,16) and also the shapes of these shanks 

(5,6; 18,19; 7,8; 20,21) and their spacings are selected 
such that an elastic force-fit is also produced in addition 

to the form fit. 
The sill according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the sill (1;15) consists of aluminium.
