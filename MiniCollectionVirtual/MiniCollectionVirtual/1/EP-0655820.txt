<ABSTRACT>
A residual current device, in particular for insulation monitoring of electrical circuits, having a summing current transformer which has a secondary winding and a primary winding which is formed from a phase conductor and a neutral conductor. The secondary winding controls a relay (which acts on switching contacts) via an amplifier and a limiter circuit. An oscillator is provided between the limiter circuit and the relay and is connected to a voltage supply circuit such that a resistance is connected to the electrical mains power supply, which consists of a live conductor and a neutral conductor. A fault current is produced which flows continuously through the primary winding, as a result of which a low-frequency signal is produced in the secondary winding, which signal causes the oscillator to oscillate.

Fault current protection switch, particularly for the 
isolation-monitoring of electrical current circuits, 

having a summation current transformer (1) which has a 
primary winding (3, 4) formed from a phase conductor (L) 

and a neutral conductor (N) and a secondary winding (5) 
which controls, via an amplifier (8) and a limit value 

circuit (16), a relay (20) acting on switching contacts 
(22),
 
characterised in that
 
a switching stage (18) which is connected to a voltage 

supply circuit (14) is provided between the limit value 
circuit (16) and the relay (20) and that 

a resistor (10) is provided between the phase conductor 
(L) and the neutral conductor (N), which leads to the 

voltage supply circuit (14), of the mains, so that there 
is generated, at the resistance (10), a fault current 

which constantly flows through the primary winding (3, 4) 
and generates, in the secondary winding (5) of the 

summation current transformer (1), a low-frequency signal 
which switches the switching stage (18) via input wiring 

(7), the amplifier (8) and the limit value circuit (16). 
Fault current protection switch according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
in the event of a fault current amplitude which lies 

below a predetermined triggering value, the limit value 
circuit (16) applies a control signal, vi
a the switching 
stage (18), to the relay (20) for the purpose of keeping 

the switching contacts (22) closed. 
Fault current protection switch according to one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that,
 
in the event of a fault current amplitude which lies 

above the predetermined triggering value, the limit value 
circuit (16) applies a control signal, via the switching  

 
stage (18), to the relay (20) for the purpose of opening 

the switching contacts (22).
