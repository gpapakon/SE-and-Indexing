<ABSTRACT>
Two half-casings (1, 2) interconnecting respective 
inlet and outlet pipelines (3, 4) combine to create 

a radial chamber (9), affording passage to the gas 
and occupied by a valve element (7) of which the 

axis is set at right angles to the axis (X) of the 
pipes; the valve element (7) is composed of a fixed 

first ring (6) , fashioned with a first solid sector 
compassing a significant angle (α) and thus partly 

occluding the radial chamber (9), also a parallel 
second ring (10) supported by and interacting with 

the first (6), fashioned similarly with a second 
solid sector compassing the same angle (α) , which 

is constrained to rotate about its own vertical 
axis (Y) together with a motorized spindle (13) 

through a range of intermediate settings, within 
the overall angle (α), between limit positions in 

which the flow passage (L) afforded by the valve 
element (7) is either completely occluded or open 

to admit the fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas flow control
valve arrangement, in particular for industrial burners.The term industrial burner generically describes
those appliances used to generate heat in a variety
of industrial applications, for example the firing
of paints or bricks in infrared tunnel kilns, or in
special equipment for the manufacture of components
fashioned in glass (vials, bottles, electric light
bulbs, etc.).Certain of these burners utilize a mixture of air
(serving to assist combustion, which is delivered
forcibly either by suction or by blowing, according
to the type of engineering solution adopted in the
burner) and natural gas (the fuel), supplied by
respective nozzles with interconnected regulating
levers. Most gas burners encountered in domestic
applications are used typically to heat a fluid of
which the temperature does not need to be held at a
constant value, so that the gas can be supplied to
the appliance by means of a simple on/off control, 
whereas burners of the industrial type in question
are designed for a type of space heating in which
constant temperatures are fundamentally important,
and achieved by monitoring and direct regulation of
the fuel mixture, or at least the gas, supplied to
the kiln.To this end, use is made of variable flow on/off
valves installed on the gas inlet pipeline. The
valve most widely adopted is a rotary "disc" type
driven by a stepping motor or similar actuator,
designed for installation on a straight gas inlet
pipeline, which comprises at least one annular
sealing element interposed between two sections of
the pipeline and occupying a position outside their
circumference, with which the regulating disc is
paired in flush contact; the disc is keyed at the
centre in such a way as to rotate about its own
axis (vertically disposed in most instances) when
activated from externally of the valve, thereby
widening or narrowing the passage afforded by the
annular element and thus varying the flow of gas to
the burner during operation.German Patent DE-C-97 245 discloses a mechanical
valve for controlling the gas flow in a burner
which comprises a casing encompassing a radial 
chamber internally of which is positioned a valve
element. The valve element has a disk with a series
of calibrating holes having different increasing
passage sections. The rotation of the disk element
permit the selection of one hole for the passage of
the gas and correspondingly a regulation of the gas
flow. Since the disk element presents only a given
number of holes, the

<CLAIMS>
A gas flow control valve arrangement for installation on a pipeline, said
arrangement comprising:


at least a first half-casing (1) and a second half-casing (2), each
half-casing being provided with a centre hole, said half-casings (1,

2) being mutually opposed and connected axially one to the other
by way of fluid-tight flanges (1f, 2f) in alignment with a horizontal

axis (X) and being adapted to be associated respectively with a first
pipeline (3) through which gas enters at an inlet pressure and a

second pipeline (4) through which gas leaves the valve at a
required outlet pressure;
at least a first disc-type valve element (7); and
an external drive means (8);

characterized in that

said half-casings (1, 2) encompass a first radial chamber (9)
affording passage to the gas, internally of which the valve element

(7) is positioned;
said disc-type valve element (7) comprises a first ring (6) and a
second ring (10),

said first ring (6) being fixed to the half-casings (1, 2) and
presenting a solid portion of angular value approximating to the

angle (α) of rotation, said second ring (10), supported by the first 
ring (6), similarly presenting a solid portion of angular value

approximating to the angle (α) of rotation, being placed parallel to
and interacting with the first ring (6) and being constrained to rotate

about its vertical axis (Y) perpendicular to said horizontal axis (X)
together with the drive means (8) through a plurality of angularly

distinct intermediate positions between two limit positions in order to
continuously regulate the rate of gas flow through the valve, said

two limit positions being separated by a distance equal to the angle
(α) of rotation, in which a flow passage (L) is respectively

completely open and completely occluded. 
A valve as in claim 1, wherein the valve element
(7) comprises a third ring (11) located adjacent to

the first or the second ring (6, 10), functioning
as a second valve element of predetermined radial

depth (S) and angular value approximating to the 
angle (α) of rotation, rotatable independently of

the second ring (10) through the agency of second
drive means (8s) between a limit position of radial

non-interference, and a limit position of radial
interference in which the second valve element is

displaced through the same angle (α), within the
compass of the flow passage (L) created by the

first valve element (7), in such a manner as to
determine a different rate of flow of the gas from

the first pipeline (3) to the second pipeline (4).
A valve as in claim 2, wherein the third ring (11)
is interposed between the first ring (6) and the

second ring (10).

a sector to a circle and exhibiting a profile (Pr)
of which the depth varies either continuously or by

discrete increments.
