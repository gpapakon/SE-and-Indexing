<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water-impermeable and at the same time breathing-active film produced in a self-supporting manner by extrusion which also exhibits an antistatic behaviour, where the film has a DIN friction index of less than 0.8, and the film comprises thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer resins whose melt flow index is at most 70 at 190 DEG C and a test load of 10 kg, where the soft segment of these elastomer resins comprising polyethylene oxide and/or contains ethylene oxide reaction products, and the relative proportion by weight of the soft segment in the polyurethane resin is between 35 % by weight and 60 % by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the polyurethane employed.

Watertight and, at the same time, breathable and
antistatic film produced without a support by

extrusion, 
characterized in that
 the film has a DIN
friction coefficient of less than 0.8, its surface

resistance is less than 10
12
 ohm and the film consists
of thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer resins whose

melt flow index at 190°C under a test load of 10 kg is
at most 70 g/10 min, determined according to

DIN 53 735, the soft-segment of these elastomer resins
consisting of polyethylene oxide and/or containing

ethylene oxide reaction products, and having a carbon-to-oxygen
weight ratio of at least 1.3 and at most 2.5

and the relative percentage by weight of the soft
segment in the polyurethane resin being between 35% by

weight and 60% by weight, based in each case on the
total weight of the polyurethane used.
Film according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
polyurethane elastomer resin used has a melt flow

index, as measured at 190°C under a test load of 10 kg,
of at most 40 g/10 min, determined according to

DIN 53 735.
Film according to Claim 1 to 2, 
characterized in
that
 the relative percentage by weight of the ethylene
oxide soft segment in the polyurethane resin used is at 

least 40% by weight and at most 50% by weight, based in
each case on the total weight of the polyurethane used.
Film according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
that
 the film is additionally provided with at least
0.3% by weight and at most 1% by weight of lubricants

and waxes, based in each case on the weight of the
total mixture used for the film production.
Film according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in
that
 the film has a thickness of 15 µm to 100 µm and,
in a preferred embodiment, of 20 µm to 50 µm.
The use of a film according to Claims 1 to 5 as an
antistatic membrane film with a selective barrier

effect against liquid and/or solid media combined with
high permeability to water vapour and an ability to

dissipate static electricity.
The use according to Claim 6 as a breathable
covering film for sheet-form textiles.
The use according to Claim 6 for producing
waterproof textiles.
The use of a film according to Claim 6 as a
breathable covering film for porous sheet-form

materials.
The use of films according to Claims 6 and/or 9 for
sealing mattresses against mites, bacteria and other

microorganisms and/or their metabolism products.
