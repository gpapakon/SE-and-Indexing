<ABSTRACT>
The instant invention introduces a method for 
producing polydiorganosiloxanes which comprises contacting 

(A) at least one organosilicon compound having in the 
molecule at least one silanol group and/or (C) 

triorganosilyl endblocker and (D) a diorganocyclicsiloxane 
with (B) a cation exchanged acid treated montmorillonite 

clay. The polydiorganosiloxanes which are produced have 
less branching along the siloxane chain than those 

polydiorganosiloxanes produced by other methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
Polydiorganosiloxanes are generally produced by
polymerizing a diorganosiloxane such as hydroxyl endblocked
dimethyl fluids, dimethyl cyclicsiloxanes, phenylmethyl
siloxanes and others in the presence of a triorganosilyl
endblocker. One typical catalyst for this reaction is an
acid such as an acid treated montmorillonite clay. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,005,023 describes linear
hydraulic silicone fluids having 2 to 2,000 silicon atoms in
the polymer chain. These fluids can be produced by several
methods. One method comprises equilibrating a silicone
fluid (produced from hydrolysis of organohalosilanes) using
an acid-treated clay. Another method comprises polymerizing
cyclicsiloxanes and mono-functional compounds using an acid
catalyst such a FILTROL™ (an acid clay).While the acid treated montmorillonite catalyst is
effective in producing the polydiorganosiloxane, it also
creates undesired branching along the polydiorganosiloxane
molecule.Further, U.S. Patent No. 4,888,405 discloses a
method for treating organocyclosiloxanes with an acid
treated montmorillonite catalyst to reduce hydroxyl content
and thus produce organocyclosiloxane-containing mixtures
which are suitable as starting materials for silicones
having reproducible viscosities. The employed catalysts
include acid activated bleaching earths and zeolites. The
cited document teaches that the catalyst condenses the
silanol while the equilibration of the cyclics occurs only
to a very small extent.Although it is fairly well known in the art that
acid treated montmorillonite clays may be used to catalyze 
certain silicone reactions, the use of cation exchanged acid
treated montmorillonite clays in the production or treatment
of polydiorganosiloxanes is unknown. "Solid Acid-Catalyzed
Allylation of Acetals and Carbonyl Compounds with Allylic
Silanes", Chem. Lett., 1986, (3), 381-384, Kawai et al.,
suggests the use of an aluminum cation or proton exchanged
montmorillonite to catalyze an unrelated reaction between
allylic silanes and carbonyl compounds.The instant invention introduces a method for
producing polydiorganosiloxanes wherein the method comprises
contacting (A) at least one organosilicon compound having in
the molecule at least one silanol group with (B) a Mg2+ or
Ca2+ cation exchanged acid treated montmorillonite clay. In
addition to the organosilicon compound having in the
molecule at least one silanol group, there may be present in
the reaction mixture (C) a triorganosilyl endblocker and/or
(D) a diorganocyclicsiloxane. The
