<ABSTRACT>
Modified polyaspartic acids are obtained by polycondensing (a) 1 to 99.9 mol % aspartic acid with (b) 99 to 0.1 mol % fatty acids, polybasic carboxylic acids, anhydrides of polybasic carboxylic acids, polybasic hydroxycarboxylic acids, monobasic polyhydroxycarboxylic acids, alcohols, amines, alkoxylated alcohols and amines, amino sugars, carbohydrates, sugar carboxylic acids and/or non-proteinogenic aminocarboxylic acids, or by polymerising monoethylenically unsaturated monomers in the presence of polyaspartic acids, in the manner of radically initiated graft copolymerisation. Also disclosed is a process for preparing these modified polyaspartic acids, as well as the use of these modified polyaspartic acids as additives to washing and cleaning agents, as water conditioning agents and as deposit inhibitors during the condensation of sugar juice.
