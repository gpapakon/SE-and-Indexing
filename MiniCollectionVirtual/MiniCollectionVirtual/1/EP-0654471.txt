<DESCRIPTION>
Novel pyridine derivatives exhibiting activity
in treating or preventing peptic ulcers,
pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and
methods of medical treatment are described.Duodenal and gastric ulcers, known collectively
as peptic ulcers, are localized erosions of the
mucous membrane of the duodenum or stomach,
respectively, which expose the underlying layers of
the gut wall to the acid secretions of the stomach
and to the proteolytic enzyme pepsin. They are
believed to be caused by autolysis which is caused by
an imbalance between offensive factors, such as acid
or pepsin, and defensive factors, such as resistance
of the mucous membrane, mucilage secretion,
bloodstream or control of the duodenum. Peptic
ulceration is the most common disease of the
gastro-intestinal tract and it is estimated that 
approximately 10 to 20% of the adult male population
will experience at some time in their lives.Peptic ulcers are cured or prevented by medical
treatment, in principle, and many pharmacotherapies
have been suggested, some with high degrees of
success.Clinically useful modialities include
H-2-blockers, such as cimetidine and ranitidine, as
anti-ulcer agents. It has been noted, more recently,
that inhibitors of H+-K+-ATPase, an enzyme
specifically present in the parietal cells of the
stomach, can effectively inhibit the secretion of
gastric acid in mammals, including man, therefore it
has been expected that a new class of anti-ulcer
agents from this viewpoint will come into existance.
More specifically, a wide variety of compounds having
a benzimidazole structure have been proposed. Among
these compounds is Omeprazole, currently under active
development, as the most promising compound; see U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,337,257; 4,255,431; and 4,508,905.
These patents describe compounds with a methoxy group 
in the 4-position of the pyridine ring. Omeprazole,
having the formula:

and further 2-(4-methoxyethoxypyridine-2-yl)-methylsulfinyl-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazole
in the
working examples thereof.Related benzyimidazole-type compounds having
anti-ulcer activities are described in published
application GB 2,134,523A. More specifically,
compounds in Which the 4-position of the pyridine
ring is substituted with an alkoxyalkoxy group with
each alkoxy group containing 1-2 carbons are
described. Example 157 of this patent describes
2-(3,5-dimethyl-4-methoxyethoxypyridine-2-yl)methylsulfinyl-5-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole.
Other
substitutions on various positions of the benzyl and
pyridine rings are also described.Biological
