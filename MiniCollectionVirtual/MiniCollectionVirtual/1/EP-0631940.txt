<ABSTRACT>
A reusable transporting and packaging system having a crate (40) for containers for free-flowing or pourable or pasty products, the containers (10, 20, 30) having a neck (11) with a round opening (12), the screw-on lid (13) having an approximately circular depression (13'), and the containers (10, 20, 30) having a base (14) at the bottom which has a downward projection (15) so that the projection (15) can be inserted in the depression (13') in the lid (13) of the container (10, 20, 30) located below it when the containers are stacked one above the other, and a stackable crate (40) which is open at the top being provided to receive a multiplicity of containers (10, 20, 30), which crate has side walls (41) formed from upright webs with connecting webs arranged at the top and a square grid of upright intermediate walls (43), the bottom (42) of the upper crate (40) being seated on the lower crate (30) when two crates (40) are stacked one above the other, the containers (10, 20, 30) having a different capacity V1, V2, V3 which have a ratio of 4:2:1 to one another, and the side walls (41) and intermediate walls (43) of the crate (40) having a height which is approximately equal to the height H of the container (10) with the capacity V1.

Reusable transport and packaging system with a crate 
(40) and containers for liquid, powdery, granulated 

or paste-like substances, whereby the containers 
(10, 20, 30) are of generally square or approximately 

circular cross-section with a side length B or 
diameter D and have at the top a centrically located 

neck (11) with a round opening (12) which can be 
closed by a screw lid (13), whereby the neck has an 

inside diameter d, whereby d is smaller than B or D, 
and the screw lid (13) is provided on its outside 

with a centrically located and approximately circular 
depression (13') whose diameter is approximately 

equivalent to the inside diameter d of the neck 
(13), and the containers (10, 20, 30) have a base 

(14) which is provided with a centrically located 
and approximately circular projection (15) pointing 

downwards whose outside diameter d' is slightly 
smaller than the inside diameter d of the neck (11) 

so that when containers are stacked on top of one 
another the projection (15) fits into the depression 

(13') of the lid (13) or into the neck (11) of the 
container (10, 20, 30) below, and the crate (40) is 

open at the top and stackable and with a generally 
rectangular cross-section to hold a large number of 

containers (10, 20, 30) and has side walls (41) 
formed from uprights with connecting crosspieces at 

the top and a grid of square fields formed by partition 
walls (43) rising vertically from the base (42)  

 
of the crate (40) at distances slightly greater than 

B or D, whereby when two crates (40) are stacked on 
top of one another the base (42) of the upper crate 

(40) rests on the top edges of the partition walls 
(43) and the side walls (41) of the lower crate 

(40), and whereby the containers (10, 20, 30) placed 
in the crate (40) are of different capacities V1, 

V2, V3 but with the cross-sections of the containers 
(10, 20, 30), necks (11) and bases (42) being of the 

same dimensions, whereby three container sizes are 
intended whose capacities V1, V2, V3 are in a ratio 

to each other of 4 : 2 : 1, and the side walls (41) 
and partition walls (43) of the crate (40) have a 

height approximately equivalent to the height H of 
the container (10) with capacity V1. 
Transport and packaging system as per claim 1, in 
which a handle (44) is located approximately centrally 

at the top edge of the partition walls (43) of 
the crate (40) and a depression (45) is provided 

approximately centrally in the base (42) of the 
crate (40), the depression (45) being so dimensioned 

and positioned that when two crates (40) are stacked 
on top of one another the handle (44) of the lower 

crate (40) fits into it. 
Transport and packaging system as per claim 1 or 2, 
in which the base (42) of the crate (40) is provided 

with a depression (46) which has a breadth b of 14 
to 16 cm, is located centrally and extends right 

across the base at right angles to the longitudinal 
axis. 
Transport and packaging system as per claim 1 to 3, 
in which the grid of square fields has two rows of 

three fields each arranged side by side.  
 
Transport and packaging system as per claim 1 to 4, 
in which the containers (10, 20, 30) are made in one 

piece out of glass or plastic or metal. 
Transport and packaging system as per one of the 
claims 1 to 5, in which the crate (40) is made in 

one piece out of plastic.
