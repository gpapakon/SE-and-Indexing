 CENTRAL CHOLECYSTOKININ ANTAGONISTS HAVING PHARMACEUTICAL ACTIVITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAgents acting at central cholecysto inin (CCK) receptors induce satiety (Schick, Yaksh, and Go, Regulatory Peptides 14:277-291, 1986. They are also expected to act as analgesics (Hill, Hughes, and Pittaway, Neuropharroacoloαrv 26:289-300, 1987, and as anticonvulsants (MacVicar, Kerrin, and Davison, Brain Research 406:130-135, 1987.Reduced levels of CCK-peptides have been found in the brains of schizophrenic patients compared with controls (Roberts, Ferrier, Lee, Crow, Johnstone,Owens, Bacarese-Hamilton, McGregor, 0'Shaughnessey, Polak, and Bloom, Brain Research 288:199-211, 1983) . It has been proposed that changes in the activity of CCK neurones projecting to the nucleus accumbens may play ~- role in schizophrenic processes by influencing dopaminergic function (Totterdell and Smith, Neuroscience 19:181-192, 1986) . This is consistent with numerous reports that CCK peptides modulate dopaminergic function in the basal ganglia and particularly the nucleus accumbens (Weiss, Tanzer, and Ettenberg, Pharmacology. Biochemistry and Behaviour 30:309-317, 1988; Schneider, Allpert, and Iversen, Peptides 4:749-753, 1983). It may therefore be expected that agents modifying CCK receptor activity may have therapeutic value in conditions associated with disturbed function of central dopaminergic function such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. 

 CCK and gastrin peptides share a common carboxy terminal pentapeptide sequence and CCK peptides can bind to the gastrin receptor of the stomach mucosa and elicit acid secretion in many species including human (Konturek, Gastrointestinal Hormones , Ch. 23 , pp . 529-564, 1980, G. G. J. Glass , ed. , Raven Press , NY) . Antagonists of the CCK-8 receptor would also be expected to be antagonists at the stomach gastrin receptor and thus be of value for conditions involving excessive acid secretion .CCK and gastrin peptides have trophic effects on the pancreas and various tissues of the gastro¬ intestinal tract (Johnson, ibid. , pp. 507-527 ) , actions which are associated with increased DNA and RNA synthesis . Moreover, gastrin secreting cells are associated with certain gastrointestinal tumors as in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (Stadil, ibid. . pp. 279-739) , and some colorectal tumors may also be gastrin-/CCK-dependent (Singh, Walker, Townsend, and Thompson, Cancer Research 46 : 1612, 1986, andSmith, J. P . , Gastroenteroloqy 95 : 1541 , 1988 ) . Antagonists of CCK/gastrin
