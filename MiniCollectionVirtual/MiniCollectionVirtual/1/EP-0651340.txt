<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for translating a series of source words in a first 
language to a series of target words in a second language. For 

an input series of source words, at least two target hypotheses, 
each comprising a series of target words, are generated. Each 

target word has a context comprising at least one other word in 
the target hypothesis. For each target hypothesis, a language 

model match score comprises an estimate of the probability of 
occurrence of the series of words in the target hypothesis. At 

least one alignment connecting each source word with at least one 
target word in the target hypothesis is identified. For each 

source word and each target hypothesis, a word match score 
comprises an estimate of the conditional probability of 
occurrence 
of the source word, given the target word in the target hypothesis 

which is connected to the source word and given the context in the 
target hypothesis of the target word which is connected to the 

source word. For each target hypothesis, a translation match 
score comprises a combination of the word match scores for the 

target hypothesis and the source words in the input series of 
source words. A target hypothesis match score comprises a 

combination of the language model match score for the target 
hypothesis and the translation match score for the target 

hypothesis. The target hypothesis having the best target 
hypothesis match score is output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to computerized language translation, such
as computerized translation of a French sentence into an English
sentence.In EP-A-0 525 470 (originally filed as United States patent application serial number 07/736,278,
filed July 25, 1991 entitled "Method and System For Natural
Language Translation" by Peter F. Brown et al) there is described
a computerized language translation system for translating a text
F in a source language to a text E in a target language. The
system described therein evaluates, for each of a number of
hypothesized target language texts E, the conditional probability
P(E|F) of the target language text E given the source language
text F. The hypothesized target language text Ê having the
highest conditional probability P(E|F) is selected as the
translation of the source language text F. Using Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability P(E|F) of the
target language text E given the source language text F can be
written as
P(E|F) = P(F|E)P(E)P(F)Since the probability P(F) of the source language text F in the
denominator of Equation 1 is independent of the target language
text E, the target language text Ê having the highest conditional
probability P(E|F) will also have the highest product P(F|E) P(E).
We therefore arrive at
In Equation 2, the probability P(E) of the target language text E
is a language model match score and may be estimated from a target
language model. While any known language model may be used to
estimate the probability P(E) of the target language text E, Brown
et al describe an n-gram language model comprising a 1-gram model,
a 2-gram model, and a 3-gram model combined by parameters whose
values are obtained by interpolated estimation.The conditional probability P(F|E) in Equation 2 is a translation
match score. As described by Brown et al, the translation match 
score P(F|E) for a source text F comprising a series of source
words, given a target hypothesis E comprising a series of target
words, may be estimated by finding all possible alignments
connecting the source words in the source text F with the target
words in the target text E, including alignments in which one or
more source words are not connected to any target words, but not
including alignments where a source word is connected to more than
one target word. For each alignment and each target word e in the
target text E connected to  source words in the source text F,
there is estimated the fertility probability n(|e) that the
target word e is connected to the  source words in
