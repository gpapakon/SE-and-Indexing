<ABSTRACT>
A brake device includes actuators (31) for brake pads 
(30), which can be pneumatically powered to which urge the 

brake pads (30) into engagement with a brake disc (20). The 
actuators (31) are mounted on a front housing portion (2) 

which is pivotable on a rear housing portion (4) to open the 
housing and allow access to the actuators (31), as for 

servicing. Opening the housing causes a normally closed 
orifice (49) in the compressed air supply line to be opened, 

relieving pressure on the actuators (31), and protecting 
them from damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to brake devices, specifically to 
brake devices which are operated pneumatically, that is, 
which include at least one pneumatic actuator operable to 
urge a brake pad against a brake disc. Such brake devices are typically arranged to allow ready 
access to the actuators for servicing. For example, the 
brake device described in EP 0 219 938 A1 has actuators 
mounted on a door of a housing containing the brake disc, the 
door being hinged to the housing so that opening the door 
allows convenient servicing. Opening the door effects actual 
displacement of the actuators, as distinguished from 
operational movement thereof, so that the brake pads are 
removed from engagement with the brake disc. It is of course 
necessary to close off the air supply to a pneumatic brake 
device before any action is taken which involves spacing the 
brake pads away from the brake disc, because there is then no 
resistance to the forces urging the brake pads outwardly from 
the actuators, which could be destroyed as a consequence. 
The present invention is concerned with the provision of 
means eliminating the possibility of such damage in these 
circumstances when the air supply has inadvertently not been 
disconnected. The invention thus relates to the kind of brake device 
in which at least one actuator can be pneumatically powered 
to urge a brake pad against a brake disc on a shaft to be 
braked, and in which the actuator can be displaced , as when 
servicing is required, so as to bring the brake pad out of 
engagement with the brake disc. The invention provides a brake device of this kind in 
which the air pressure within the actuator housing is 
relieved as a consequence of the actuator displacement. The 
invention also provides a brake device of this kind in which  
 
the air supply to the actuator is at least partially diverted 
as a consequence of the actuator housing displacement. Whilst it would be possible to achieve the desired 
pressure relief for the actuator by inclusion of a valve in 
the compressed air supply line which closes as a consequence 
of the actuator housing displacement, it is preferred to 
provide for relief of the air pressure supplied to the 
actuator by opening an alternative path. The invention is 
then not dependent on the correct functioning of a valve, and 
the opening in the air supply path can be employed to signal 
to the operator that he has neglected to turn off the air 
supply to the brake device. Thus the invention can provide a passage communicating 
with

<CLAIMS>
A brake device having an operative position in which 
at least one actuator can be pneumatically powered to urge a 

brake pad against a brake disc on a shaft to be braked, and 
an inoperative position in which the or each actuator can be 

displaced, so as to bring the brake pad out of the 
engagement with the brake disc, and in which, as a 

consquence of the actuator displacement, the air pressure 
within the or each actuator is relieved and the air supply 

to the or each actuator is at least partially diverted. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 1, comprising a 
passage communicating with the or each actuator, the passage 

having a relief orifice arranged to be opened to provide 
pressure relief on displacement of the or each actuator from 

the operative position of the device. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 2, in which the 
relief orifice is provided at a position on the supply line 

between the compressed air inlet to the brake device and the 
or each actuator. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 3, in which the 
orifice is included in the supply line, or in a side passage 

leading from the supply line. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 2, 3 or 4, in 
which the orifice is normally closed by engagement with a 

closure member, and becomes separated from the closure 
member as a consequence of the actuator displacement. 
A brake device as claimed in claim 5, in which the 
closure member is a resilient plug. 
A brake device as claimed in any one of claim 2 to 6 
in which the relief orifice and closure member are each 

located on respective portions of a housing of the brake 
device, one of which portions is movable with respect to the 

other portion to displace the or each actuator to the 
inoperative position of the device and to allow access to 

the or each actuator for servicing.
