<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to semiconductor devices and to the
packages thereof.In particular, the invention relates to a semiconductor
device comprising a material non-wettable by a
solder, an electrically conductive area of a material
wettable by said solder disposed on said surface, and a
terminal lead including a base portion solder bonded to
said conductive area.An object of the invention is to provide stress
relief at the bond between the terminal lead and the
substrate.To this end, a semiconductor device according to
the invention is characterised in that: the electrically
conductive area has a slot in one edge thereof, the slot
overlying and exposing a portion of the substrate; the
shape of the base portion corresponding generally to that
of the conductive area including a slot in one edge
thereof; a vertical portion of the terminal lead is
connected to the base portion at the bottom edge of the
slot in the base portion; and the base portion fits within the periphery of the
underlying conductive area except that the slot in the
conductive area is deeper than the slot in the base
portion, whereby the bottom edge of the slot in the base
portion has a portion overlying said exposed portion of the
substrate surface.Although not limited thereto, this invention has
particular utility in the case of semiconductor devices of
the type shown in U.S. Patent 5,028,987. This Patent
discloses a package comprising a cup-like base including a
side wall having a flat upper surface. On the inside 
bottom of the base is soldered a semiconductor chip having
terminal leads attached to and extending upwardly from an
upper surface of the chip. The package includes a flat lid
which is soldered to the upper surface of the side wall of
the base. The chip terminal leads extend through and
beyond apertures through the lid and are soldered to the
side walls of the apertures. The package hermetically
encloses the chip.One disadvantage of the foregoing described package
is that, in the process of soldering the lid to the base,
unwanted impurities released during the soldering process
can become trapped within the package and damage the
device.A semiconductor device embodying the present
invention may be combined with a package including a cup-like
base having a bottom wall and an encircling side wall
which has, at its upper end, a laterally, outwardly
extending metal flange. The flange extends entirely around
the upper periphery of the base. A lid for the package
comprises a plate-like member, e.g., of ceramic, having, at
the

<CLAIMS>
A semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor
substrate (12) having a surface comprising a material non-wettable

by a solder, an electrically conductive area (60)
of a material wettable by said solder disposed on said

surface, and a terminal lead (28) including a base portion
(30) solder bonded to said conductive area (60)

characterised in that: the electrically conductive area
(60) has a slot (80) in one edge (82) thereof, the slot

(80) overlying and exposing a portion of the substrate
(12); the shape of the base portion (30) corresponds

generally to that of the conductive area (60) including a
slot (84) in one edge (86) thereof; a vertical portion (32)

of the terminal lead (28) is connected to the base portion
(30) at the bottom edge (88) of the slot (84) in the base portion (30); and the base

portion (30) fits within the periphery of the underlying
conductive area (60) except that the slot (80) in the

conductive area (60) is deeper than the slot (84) in the
base portion (30), whereby the bottom edge (88) of the slot

(84) in the base portion (30) has a portion overlying said
exposed portion of the substrate surface.
A device according to Claim 1, wherein the
conductive area (60) is of generally rectangular shape.
A device according to Claim 1 or 2 in combination
with a package (14), wherein the vertical portion (32)

extends through an aperture (34) in a lid (42) of the
package (14). 
A device according to Claim 3, wherein the lid (42)
of the package is a ceramic lid (42) for a metal cup-like

bottom (16) of the package, and in that said lid (42) and
said bottom (16) each has a metal flange (48, 26) around

its periphery that overlap and that are bonded together.
A device according to Claim 4, wherein said flange
(48) of said ceramic lid (42) is bonded to an interior

surface (62) thereof.
