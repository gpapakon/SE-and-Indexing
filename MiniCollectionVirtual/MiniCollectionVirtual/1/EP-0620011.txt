<ABSTRACT>
Immunoconjugates of antibodies or antigen-recognizing 
fragments of antibodies and monovalent 

cytotoxic drug derivatives make use of β-alanine derived 
linkers wherein the antibody or fragment thereof is 

attached to the linker's carboxy group via an ester or 
amide group and the drug is attached through the linker's 

2-position methylene group. Intermediates, compositions 
and methods of use also are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
In recent years, pharmaceutical chemists have 
worked to provide more specific and potent drugs for the 
treatment of disease. In the case of cancer and other 
disease which function by the creation of specific 
abnormalities of cells, most of the useful drugs have been 
of the cytotoxic type which function by killing the 
abnormal cell. Such drugs are quite potent and may be 
hazardous to the recipient, even life-threatening. In an attempt to direct a drug to particular 
cells, tissues, or pathogen within a host, efforts have 
been made to develop a mechanism for targeting such drugs, 
particularly highly cytotoxic drugs, directly to the 
afflicted area or pathogen, without administering a whole-body 
dosage. However, no antibody-drug conjugate has been 
approved for therapeutic use. The present invention 
expands the scope of immunoconjugate technology by 
providing novel immunoconjugates useful for cell-/tissue-/pathogen-specific 
drug delivery in mammals and 
intermediates thereto. The present invention belongs to the fields of 
organic chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, and 
immunology, and provides immunoconjugates which are 
vehicles for targeting large doses of pharmaceutically-active 
compounds to undesirable cells, tissues, and 
mammalian pathogens. Immunoconjugates of the present invention 
consist of antibodies, preferably monoclonal antibodies 
which act as targeting agents, a pharmaceutically-active 
compound which has activity against the cell, tissue, or 
host in need of treatment, and an organic compound which 
joins or links ("linker") such antibodies with such 
pharmaceutically-active compounds. Intermediates for the 
preparation of the immunoconjugates are also provided.  The present invention provides a 
physiologically-acceptable drug conjugate of Formula I 
wherein
 
   R¹ is C₁-C₄ alkyl;
 
   R² is a monovalent drug derivative having a 
reactively-available amino, hydroxy or thiol function;
 
   m is an integer from 1 to 10; and
 
   Ab is an antibody, or antigen-recognizing 
fragment thereof, which recognizes an antigen associated 
with a cell, tissue, or pathogen to which delivery of the 
drug is desirable. The invention also provides intermediates of 
Formula II 
wherein
 
   R¹ is C₁-C₄ alkyl;
 
   R⁴ is a carboxy protecting group;
 
   R⁵ is H₂, =C(OH)₂, =CHOR⁶, or =CHSR⁶; and
 
   R⁶ is C₁-C₄ alkyl. This invention also provides intermediates of 
Formula III 
wherein
 
   R¹ is C₁-C₄ alkyl;
 
 
   R² is a monovalent drug derivative having a 
reactively-available amino,
