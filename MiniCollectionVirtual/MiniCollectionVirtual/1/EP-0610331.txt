<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a circuit assembly including a measurement coil (L) located in one arm (2) of a bridge circuit. To power the bridge, the invention calls for two synchronized signal generators (14, 16) which can be controlled independently of each other and can supply the bridge simultaneously with different voltages. This makes it possible to balance the bridge, and hence carry out eddy-current testing at different frequencies, without the need for mechanically changeable circuit elements in the bridge arms (2, 8).
