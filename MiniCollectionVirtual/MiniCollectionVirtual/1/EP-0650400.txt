<ABSTRACT>
The present finding relates to a suitable apparatus for end cleaning water closet (WC) bowls by means of concentrated water jets, and for disinfecting them and their seat by means of steam jets, which is characterized in that it is a portable apparatus suitable for being hand-traversed by the user, provided with a tank (2) suitable for being filled with water, and containing the devices (5, 11, 23, 9) for generating, on command, water jets and a steam jet, respectively, and with a power supply pot or support means equipped with electrical tap, battery charger, timer and connectors, suitable for feeding the electrical power and heat accumulators the apparatus is equipped with. Thanks to its electricity (5) and heat (23) accumulators, the apparatus can operate as a stand-alone water jets and steam jet generating unit, disconnected from both its power supply pot or support means, and power supply cables from mains.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present finding relates to a suitable 
apparatus for the end cleaning of the water closet 
(WC) bowls by means of concentrated water jets, and, 
for disinfesting them and their seat, by means of 
steam jets. (DE-A-3 530 954). It frequently happens that, after that the 
physiological evacuation has been performed, the water 
flushing stream commanded by the user by a pushbutton, 
a handle, a chain system, or the like, is not enough 
in order to adequately clean the water toilet bowl and 
that some residues of excrements may remain 
tenaciously sticking to the inner surface. In these 
cases, use is made of the purposely provided brush, 
which is a standard toilet fitting. Such a kind of operation, which, per se, is not 
so pleasant, is also an unhygienic one, because a 
portion of removed matter unavoidably remains on the 
same brush, and even repeated flushes are surely 
insufficient for a thorough cleaning of the bristles, 
so that the user will place again the brush inside its 
container being perfectly aware that he is storing 
some "foreign matter" together with it -- although 
both said parts, i.e., the brush and the container are 
usually thoroughly cleaned from time to time. Another problem, still arising in connection with 
the use of the water closet bowl, relates to the seat, 
i.e., where the toilet user seats. Not always said seat is clean and, besides all,  
 
in particular in the case of toilets shared by a 
plurality of users, e.g., in large office buildings, 
communities, restaurants, and so forth, it certainly 
does not gain the users' confidence; on the contrary, 
a great mistrust, and, as a matter of fact, the 
application has spread of dispensers (nearly always 
against payment) of paper rings suitable for covering 
the toilet bowl seat. Now, with the validity of such an approach being 
fully acknowledged -- paper ring is an extremely good 
isolating means for dirt and germs -- it, in our 
opinion, is anyway still affected by a number of weak 
points, such as, e.g., a further paper waste, the 
relatively high cost of the dispenser unit, the 
objective difficulty of a diffusion thereof in private 
homes, in which it would be unaesthetic and expensive. Concrete doubts may however be raised also in 
those cases when this device is installed, because it 
may happen that owing to such reasons as avarice, lack 
of immediate availability of coins or tokens, faults, 
store exhaustion, and the like, this service cannot be 
taken advantage of. It may also happen that sometimes, before
