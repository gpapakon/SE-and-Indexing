<ABSTRACT>
The expansion chamber (11), in fluid-exchange contact with the upper plastic fluid box (header box) (3) of the cooling radiator (1) of the heat (internal-combustion) engine of a motor vehicle, is fixed on lugs (12, 13) which are integrally moulded with the metal fluid boxes (7) of a radiator (2) for cooling air on the supercharger of this engine, this second radiator being attached to the front face of the first radiator.

Rigid assembly comprising a first heat exchanger (1), 
flat in shape overall, having at least one plastic top fluid 

chamber, and an expansion tank (11) in fluid-exchange 
relationship with the top fluid chamber, situated in the 

vicinity thereof, characterised in that it comprises a second 
heat exchanger (2), flat in shape overall, the first and 

second heat exchangers being oriented parallel to the same 
substantially vertical plane and juxtaposed so as to have pass 

through them in series a flow of air directed perpendicularly 
to this plane, and in that the expansion tank is rigidly fixed 

to at least one element (7, 8) of the second heat exchanger. 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said element is a fluid chamber. 
Assembly according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
expansion tank is elongated in a substantially horizontal 

direction parallel to the said plane, and is fixed by its two 
end regions respectively to the top end regions (9, 10) of two 

opposing lateral fluid chambers (7, 8) of the second heat 
exchanger (2). 
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterised in that each 
end region of the expansion tank is fixed to two lugs (12, 13) 

made in one piece with the corresponding fluid chamber, 
respectively by two fixing points (15, 17) separated from each 

other around the transverse section of the expansion tank. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised 
in that the fluid chambers of the second heat exchanger are 

cast in aluminium alloy. 
Assembly according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the said top fluid chamber (3) of the 

first heat exchanger (1) is made from plastic.  
 
Assembly according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the second heat exchanger (2) is 

disposed opposite the face of the first heat exchanger (1) 
turned towards the rear of the vehicle. 
Assembly according to Claim 7, characterised in that the 
expansion tank (11) is disposed in front of the first heat 

exchanger, its dimension in the front-to-rear direction being 
partly superimposed on that of the second heat exchanger. 
Assembly according to Claim 8, characterised in that the 
expansion tank extends to a level below the top fluid chamber 

of the first heat exchanger, and is situated in the lateral 
direction between the two fluid chambers (7, 8) of the second 

heat exchanger (2). 
Assembly according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the first heat exchanger is a cooling 

radiator for the thermal engine driving the vehicle and the 
second heat exchanger is a radiator for cooling the booster 

air for the said engine.
