<ABSTRACT>
Method for proving volume flowmeters, in which in dynamic operation with flying start-stop a predetermined minimum quantity of the liquid is guided through the volume flowmeter (specimen) to be proved, and whose indication is compared with the desired indication determined by comparative measurement or by weighing and converting the liquid volume guided through, a rapid balance being used as comparison standard, the volume inlet into the weighing container being configured such that no dynamic force component is exerted on the balance as a result of the kinetic energy of the inflowing proving liquid, and the beginning and the end of the proving process, that is to say the reading of the respective balance states, being triggered in each case by a volume pulse of the volume flowmeter to be proved, as well as a device for carrying out this method.

Method of proving volume flow meters, wherein in dynamic operation with
flying start-stop a specified minimum quantity of the fluid is passed through

the flow meter (4) and its read-out is compared with the set-point read-out
determined by weighing and converting the volume of fluid passed through,

the beginning and end of the proving operation, i.e. the read-out of the
respective weighing scales, being determined in a manner known 
per se
 by a
respective volume pulse of the flow meter (4) to be proved, 
characterised in
that
 a weighing scale (5) is used whose weighing container (9) is provided
with an inlet tube (12) immersed in the fluid (11) and with means for the fluid

to flow out radially.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 a plurality of flow meters
(4) connected in series and traversed by the same stream of fluid are tested

simultaneously and start and end their proving operation independently of one
another by volume pulses.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the flow meter (4)
are first flushed and after a specified flushing phase a general readiness

signal is sent to the test bay computer (7), after which each flow meter carries
out its respective proving operation independently of the others.
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the
weighing scale weight is corrected by the reaction force to the changed

upward thrust brought about as a result of the changing immersion depth of
the inlet tube (12) in order to introduce the fluid (11) into the weighing

container (9). 
Method according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the correction of upward
thrust is calculated from the inlet tube cross section and the change in

immersion depth calculated from the increase in the weighing scale read-out.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one of claims 1 to 5,
having an outlet container (1), from which fluid is sent through the flow meter

(4) disposed in a test bay (3), the fluid being introduced via an inlet tube (12)
into the weighing container (9) of a preferably electronic weighing scale (5),

which is coupled to a test bay computer, to which also the individual flow
meters are connected, 
characterised in that
 the weighting scale (5) has
measuring times of less than 40 milliseconds and a degree of error of less

than 0.1%, 
in that
 the weighing container (9) is provided with an inlet tube (12)
immersed in the fluid and with means for the fluid to flow out radially, and 
in
that
 the individual flow meters (4) are so connected to the test bay computer
(7) that a respective volume pulse of each flow meter (4) starts the proving

operation by fixing the weight of the weighing scale at that moment, and a
further volume pulse of the flow meter (4), specifiable by the test bay

computer by fixing the weight of the weighing scale at that time and making a
comparison between the volume deduced therefrom, ends with a

measurement read-out of the flow meter (4).
Apparatus according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the test bay computer
is wired for processing pulses of variable valency according to a byte-pulse

method.
Apparatus according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterised in that
 the weighing
scale (5) is formed as a beam weighing scale with the weighing container (9)

on one side and testing weights on the other side and with a force-free
distance or phase-angle sensor for detecting the position of the interpolation

indicator preferably fixed thereto. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that
 various
scales (5) are provided with different ranges of measurement and

corresponding weighing containers (9) with comparative relative accuracy and
weighing speed, which are used according to the test through-flow.
