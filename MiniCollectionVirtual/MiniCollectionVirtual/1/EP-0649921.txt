<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high-tenacity polyamide
fiber. More particularly, it relates to a high-tenacity
polyamide fiber which is characterized as, when it is
embedded in rubber as a reinforcing fiber and the rubber is
vulcanized, exhibiting tenacity reduction only to a minor
extent and yielding a vulcanized cord having a high
tenacity.Polyamide fibers have good toughness, adhesion,
fatigue resistance and other properties, and are widely used
as industrial materials. Of polyamide fibers, a polyhexamethylene
adipamide fiber is especially suitable for
products which are used under severe conditions or for which
a high quality is required. Excellent dimensional stability
to high temperature and thermal resistance of this fiber is
utilized in the step of processing the fiber for the
manufacture of the products.It is always required that industrial products are
light-weight and thus it is important that the amount of
reinforcing fibers contained in the industrial products is
minimized without substantial reduction of the reinforcing
performance. For satisfying this requirement, fibers having
a higher tenacity have been eagerly desired and many
attempts of developing high-tenacity fibers have heretofore
been made. With regard to polyamide fibers, proposals of
making high-tenacity polyamide fibers were made, for
example, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application No. 1-168913
and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-241007.Namely, a high-tenacity polyhexamethylene adipamide 
fiber having a special structure defined by specific fiber
structural properties is described in Japanese Unexamined
Patent Application No. 1-168913. This fiber is
characterized by the following features (a) through (f) as
compared with conventional polyhexamethylene adipamide
fibers:
(a) the crystal orientation function is the same or
higher,(b) the amorphous orientation fuction is higher,(c) the long period in the direction of the fiber axis is
the same,(d) the long period in the direction perpendicular to the
fiber axis is larger,(e) the main dispersion temperature of a mechanical loss
tangent curve as obtained by a dynamic viscoelastic
measurement is lower, and(f) the DSC melting point as measured by a Zep method is
higher and the perfection of crystal is higher.In other words, the high-tenacity polyhexamethylene
adipamide fiber has a fiber structure capable of developing
a high tenacity, i.e., features (a) and (b), as well as a
fiber structure capable of developing stability against
mechanical functions, i.e., features (d),
