<ABSTRACT>
In order to be able to feed a load either with a controlled pressure or a supply pressure, a pressure-medium inlet of the load is connected to the pressure-medium outlet of a shuttle valve, the first pressure-medium inlet of which is connected to the pressure-medium outlet of a control valve and the second pressure-medium inlet of which is connected to the pressure-medium outlet of another valve. The pressure-medium inlet of the other valve is connected to a source of pressure medium. To reduce the expenditure on connecting parts and connecting lines, the shuttle valve (14, 21, 37) is integrated into the control valve (1). With its free end, a first passage (9) in the housing, the said passage being connected to the pressure-medium outlet (48) of the first valve (1), forms a first valve seat (14), and with its end opposite the first valve seat (14), a second passage (24) arranged in an additional housing part (23) which is secured on the housing (41) of the first valve (1) in the region of the first valve seat (14) forms a second valve seat (21). A valve member (37) is arranged movably between the two valve seats (14) and (21). The first passage (9) in the housing forms the first pressure-medium inlet and the second passage (24) forms the second pressure-medium inlet of the shuttle valve (14, 21, 37). The pressure-medium outlet of the shuttle valve (14, 21, 37) is formed by another passage (36) in the housing, which adjoins a pressure-medium chamber (38) in which the two valve seats (21, 14) and the valve member (37) are situated.

valve member (37) is movably arranged; 
e) the pressure medium output (10) of the shuttle 
valve is formed by the pressure medium chamber  

 
(38) and by a pressure medium line (36
) adjoining 
the pressure medium chamber (38); 
f) the first pressure medium input (49) of the

first valve seat (14) for the shuttle valve (14, 

21, 37); 
i) an additional housing part (23) is provided, which 
is secured in the region of the first valve seat 

(14) to the housing (41) of the first valve (1) in 
such a manner that it forms with the housing (41) 

of the first valve (1) the pressure chamber (38) 
in which the first valve seat (14) of the shuttle 

valve (14, 21, 27) lies; 
k) the additional housing part (23) has a second 
channel (24) which opens into the pressure medium 

chamber (38) of the shuttle valve (14, 21, 37); 
l) the end of the second channel (24) opening into 
the pressure medium chamber (38) is constructed so  

 
that it serves as second valve seat (21) of the 

shuttle valve (14, 21, 37).
