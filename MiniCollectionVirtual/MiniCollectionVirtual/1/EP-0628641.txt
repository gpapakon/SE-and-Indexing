<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a constrained hardening apparatus for hardening a rod type special member, which is 
liable to be bent during the hardening thereof, while preventing the same member from being deformed. In a set of 

metal mold in which the contact surfaces of adjacent mold members are in an engaged condition, the inner side of 
the metal rnold consists of a plurality of projecting portions and recessed portions which have free ends the shape of 

which is in agreement with that of a material to be hardened, and hardening liquid ejection ports are provided in these 
recessed portions. Since the material is not pressed while it is soft, i.e., when the cooling of the material is started, 

deformation, such as flattening does not occur on even a hollow material, such as a pipe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a constrained quenching
apparatus for hardening a workpiece, e.g. a round bar,
without warping and to a heat treatment apparatus employing
that apparatus. The present invention is directed towards
quenching of an asymmetrical workpiece which has a notable
tendency to warping and of a hollowed workpiece which is difficult
to be dealt with conventional quenching apparatus.Many machinery components having a round bar shape are
subjected to a hardening process. When the component is symmetrical
about a center axis, it is usually rotated about
the axis during quenching to prevent warping. If the workpiece
is asymmetrical about its center axis, such as round
bar component extending a flat side thereof, it tends to warp
by inconsistency of a cooling rate. For preventing from warping
by the quenching such axially asymmetrical component,
a press quenching method which is one of the constrained
quenching is commonly utilized. In the press quenching
method, a part or the entire of a workpiece is securely held 
at a pressure in a set of dies of which inside wall is adapted
to match and accommodate the shape of the workpiece, and cooled
down by thermal dissipation throughout the dies or direct
immersion into cooling liquid. In the case of thermal dissipation
throughout the dies, the cooling of the workpiece is
effected through the dies which are directly cooled by liquid. US-A-3 294 597
provides a method for quenching a metal member such
as a long channel member for use as truck trailer side
rails.
The moveable sidewall of the female
die is moved to clamp the hot channel member between
the fixed and moveable sidewalls of the female die
sections, and thereby cause hot straightening of the
channel member. The expandable male dies are then moved
toward the female die members and into the channel
member throughout its length and expanded laterally
into engagement with the side flanges of the channel
member. The female dies press against the outer surface
of the channel member while held from the inside by the
male dies, firmly clamping the channel member. Recently, tubular shaped components tend to be adopted
instead of the traditional solid bars in machinery primarily
in automobiles for minimizing the overall weight of the products.
However, in the conventional press quenching method,
the tubular workpiece is easily collapsed because it has a
hollow inside thereof and being softened by heat.The press quenching method allows the cooling speed to
be hardly controlled in desired locations.

<CLAIMS>
A constrained quenching apparatus comprising a set of
two or more dies disposed on a pressing means, said dies having

plural projections provided on the inner side thereof;
said projections coinciding with the contour of a workpiece when

said dies are closed with their die faces being in contact, and
having plural recesses therein defined by the projections for

communicating with one another and extending to the outside
of said dies; one or more of said recesses in at least one of

said dies being provided with one or more cooling liquid blow
holes.
A constrained quenching apparatus according to claim
1, wherein plural cooling liquid blow holes are allocated in

the each die and a flow controlling means is fitted into each
of said cooling liquid blow holes for determining an amount

of the cooling liquid flow.
A constrained quenching apparatus according to claim
1, wherein the dies are constructed by cutting the place of

the recesses from blocks, inner walls of said blocks coinciding
with contour of the workpiece.
A constrained quenching apparatus according to claim
1, wherein the dies are constructed by mounting separate projections

to inner walls of blocks, said inner walls being
larger than the contour of the workpiece. 
A heat treatment apparatus comprising an induction
heater arranged close with the constrained quenching apparatus

as defined in claims 1, 2, 3 or 4 so that the workpiece can travel in the
same height.
