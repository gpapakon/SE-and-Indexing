<ABSTRACT>
A composition which is effective in preventing or 
treating cancer comprises ground germinated rice or a liquid 

extract of rice or germinated rice. The extract is obtained 
by treatment with water or an organic solvent, optionally in 

conjunction with an enzyme treatment or fermentation. 
The anti-ulcer agent may be administered orally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for the 
prophylaxis and treatment of cancer, the agent being 
obtained from rice or germinated rice and capable of being 
used in the fields of medicine and food. The most usual cause of death in Japan at present is 
cancer, and various medicaments have been developed for its 
prophylaxis and treatment. However, these medicaments pose problems in respect 
of their side effects, and restrictions on dosage and the 
dosage period. Also, since these medicaments are almost 
always mixtures of single compounds problems arise from the 
side effects of each single compound and furthermore the 
taking of a medicament for a long period of time causes 
anxiety. An agent, which is effective for the prophylaxis 
and treatment of cancer, exhibits no side effects, and is 
safe has not yet been developed. On the other hand, uses of rice have been developed 
such as for producing 'sake', 'shochu' (Japanese spirits 
distilled from rice), sweet sake, vinegar and 'koji' (malted 
rice), in addition to its use as a staple food, and thus 
rice has long been an indispensable part of life. As 
another known use of rice, there may be cited the use of a 
small rice-bran bag for cosmetic purposes. Accordingly rice 
has been considered to be at most a simple staple food 
providing a starch source, and there has been neither the 
conception that rice contains a therapeutically effective 
component nor that this effective component might be 
utilized. Currently, the side effects of medicaments on human 
beings have become a problem and hence there has been desire  
 
for a cancer prophylactic and treatment agent which has no 
side effects and which is safe, even when the agent is 
regularly used. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
cancer prophylactic and treatment agent obtained from rice 
or germinated rice, which is safe and inexpensive and which 
is also utterly safe when the agent is regularly used. The inventors have investigated various vegetable 
components centring around rice which is a staple food from 
the view point of an environmental balance between animals 
and plants; and during the course thereof, it has become 
apparent that rice has many possibilities and effects which 
have never been anticipated until now. Thus, rice which has 
been used as a stapie food and the great safety of which has 
thus been actually proved has been targeted as the subject 
of the present investigation into its general utilization. 
During the course of the investigations, it has

extract of rice or germinated rice, for use in medicine. 
A composition comprising germinated rice, or an 
extract of rice or germinated rice, for use in the 

prophylaxis or treatment of cancer. 
A composition as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein 
said germinated rice is in ground or particulate form, or 

said extract is derived from rice or germinated rice in 
ground or particulate form. 
A composition as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein

from amylolytic enzymes, proteolytic enzymes, lipases, fibre 

decomposition enzymes, lignin decomposition enzymes, pectin 
decomposition enzymes and 'koji', and separating the liquid 

product. 
A composition as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the extract is obtained by treating polished rice or 

germinated rice with an organic solvent, and separating the 
liquid product.
