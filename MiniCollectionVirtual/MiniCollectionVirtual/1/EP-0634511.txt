<ABSTRACT>
A web is composed of microfine mixed fibers spun 
according to melt-blown process and comprising high 

melting point microfine fibers and low melting point 
microfine fibers having a melting point difference of 

10°C or more, the low melting point microfine fibers 
being present in a proportion of 10 to 90% by weight of 

the microfine mixed fibers. The web may be converted, by

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microfine mixed fibers spun 
according to melt-blown process, a fiber product consisting 
of the microfine mixed fibers and a process for producing 
the fibers and the fiber product. More particularly, it 
relates to fiber products consisting of microfine mixed 
fibers consisting of high melting point microfine fibers 
and low melting point microfine fibers, the melting point 
difference between both the fibers being 10°C or more, 
and the content of the low melting point microfine fibers 
in the mixed fibers being 10 to 90% by weight, and a process 
for producing the fiber products. Concretely, it relates to a cylindrical filter having 
a good pressure resistance strength and filtration accuracy 
and a long filtration life. Microfine fibers have been processed into non-woven 
fabrics or molded products and have been broadly used as 
the surface material for disposable diaper, dust-proof 
clothes, mask, wiping cloth, filter for microfiltration, 
etc. As the filter for microfiltration, an air filter, 
a filter for washing liquid during the steps of producing  
 
electronic equipments, a prefilter for water for 
pharmaceutical preparations, a filter for removing 
microorganisms from foods or potable water, etc. are known. Japanese patent application laid-open No. Sho 54-134177 
discloses a process for producing a non-woven fabric of 
microfine fibers wherein a thermoplastic resin is degraded 
to have a low viscosity in a spinning device, followed 
by spinning according to melt-blown process. Further, 
Japanese patent application laid-open No. Sho 60-99057 
discloses a process for producing a non-woven fabric of 
microfine conjugate fibers wherein two kinds of 
thermoplastic resins are conjugated into side by side type, 
followed by spinning according to melt-blown process. As the filter, Japanese patent application laid-open 
No. Sho 60-216818 discloses a filter for microfiltration 
obtained by stacking microfine fibers on a shaft and 
supporting the structure only by way of mechanical 
entanglement of the fibers to one another, and having a 
constant void ratio. Japanese patent application laid-open 
No. Hei 1-297113 discloses a cylindrical filter 
obtained by winding up non-woven fabrics, wherein the closer 
to the outer surface of the filter, the larger the fiber 
diameter and the pore diameter. Japanese patent application 
laid-open No. Hei 4-126508 discloses a cartridge filter 
consisting of microfine conjugate fibers, prepared according 
to melt-blown process. Japanese
