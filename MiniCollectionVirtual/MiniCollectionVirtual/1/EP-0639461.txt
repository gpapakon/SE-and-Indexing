<ABSTRACT>
An ink cartridge for supplying ink to a 
recording head includes a vacuum producing material 

accommodating portion (4) for accommodating a vacuum 
producing material (3); an ink containing portion (6) for 

containing ink, adjacent the material accommodating 
portion (4), with which the ink containing portion (6) is in 

fluid communication through an opening at a bottom 
portion; an ink supply opening for permitting supply 

of the ink, in the material accommodating portion (4); an 

inward projection (13) in the ink containing portion (6); and 
the projection (13) is not less than 0.2 mm away from a 

boundary between the material accommodating portion (4) 
and the ink containing portion (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
cartridge for containing ink to be supplied to a
recording head, which is detachably mountable to the
recording head, or to the recording apparatus.An ink jet recording apparatus, particularly
an ink jet recording apparatus using thermal energy
for ejecting ink, is widely used with various
apparatuses such as printers, facsimile machines,
copying machines or the like, as a means for recording
on a recording material.From the standpoints of apparatus downsizing,
cost reduction, maintenance free or the like, a
cartridge type recording means in which a recording
head and an ink container are connected and are
detachably mountable to a carriage in a recording
apparatus.The cartridge type recording means includes
two types, in one of which the recording head and the
ink container are unified, and in the other of which
the recording head and the ink container are separate
but are unified on the carriage. Recently, the
service life of a recording head is extended as
compared with the ink capacity of the ink container,
the latter type cartridge is noted. As for the structures of the exchangeable ink
containers, there are various types, in one of which
an ink absorbing material occupies substantially the
entirety of the ink containing space to provide the
recording head with a desired vacuum, which will be
called hereinafter "full-sponge type". In another
type, the ink absorbing material occupies
approximately one half of the ink containing space.
This has been proposed for the purpose of increasing
the ink capacity. This will be called "half-sponge
type".In a further example, the inside of the ink
container is filled with the liquid ink only for the
purpose of further increasing the ink capacity, in
which the vacuum is provided by another mechanism.
This will be called "full-ink type".Among these types, the present invention is
directed to a half-sponge type cartridge with which
the ink capacity is relatively large, and the vacuum
generation is relatively easy.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown an
example of a half sponge type ink cartridge in a
perspective sectional view. The main body 1 of the
ink cartridge is provided with an ink supply port 2
for connection with an ink jet recording head, and an
air vent 10 for introducing the ambient air, provided
above the ink supply port 2. It comprises a vacuum 
producing material containing portion 4 for containing
the vacuum producing member such as a water absorbing
sponge or the like for retaining the recording ink,
and an
