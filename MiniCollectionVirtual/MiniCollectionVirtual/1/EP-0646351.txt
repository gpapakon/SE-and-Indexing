<ABSTRACT>
An applicator for applying a sheet (65) of surgical 
material, e.g., a surgical mesh, to internal body 

tissue includes a delivery tube (100), a deployment tube (102) 
slidably received within the delivery tube, and a 

shaft or irrigation tube (106) slidably received within 
the deployment tube. An expandable spreader tip (60) is 

connected between the distal ends of the shaft and 
the deployment tube. The spreader tip is collapsed 

and inserted in the delivery tube with the surgical 
mesh. The applicator is inserted through a trocar 

tube into a body cavity and the spreader tip is 
exposed by retracting the delivery tube relative to 

the deployment tube and shaft. The applicator has 
a first actuator (122) for urging the spreader tip and 

surgical mesh into engagement with the tissue as 
the deployment tube is retracted and a second 

actuator (130) for advancing the deployment tube relative 
to the shaft to expand the spreader tip to apply 

the surgical mesh to the tissue. The spreader tip 
includes a plurality of flexible strips each having 

its opposite ends pivotally connected to the distal 
ends of
 the shaft and the deployment tube. The 
applicator includes a return spring to bias the 

deployment tube proximally relative to the shaft to 
normally maintain the spreader tip collapsed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an applicator
adapted for applying a sheet of surgical material
such as a surgical mesh to tissue within a human
body and, more particularly, to a surgical mesh
applicator including an expandable spreader tip
which is insertable into the body through an
incision to enable a surgeon to apply a surgical
mesh to tissue inside the body. The applicator is
particularly suitable for insertion through an
endoscopic tube for spreading a surgical mesh over
internal body tissue in the performance of surgery
to repair a hernia.In the prior art, it is known to utilize an
inserter device for the purpose of installing an
absorbant tampon in the internal vaginal cavity.
For example, U. S. Patent 3,857,395 discloses an
inserter device which includes a pair of outwardly
bendable arms which bilaterally spread the tampon
within the vaginal cavity.In addition, other types of instruments are
known in the prior art for manipulating internal
body tissue. For example, U. S. Patent 4,909,789
discloses observation assisting forceps including a
set of expandable wires mounted on a shaft which is
normally retracted into a sheath. When the shaft
is advanced, the wires project out of the sheath
and expand into a fan-shaped configuration in the 
same plane. The expanded wires can be used to set
aside internal organs obstructing the observation
with an abdominal cavity endoscope. The wires are
provided at the tips with spherical members which
prevent the organs from being hurt.U. S. Patent 4,654,028 discloses an incision
opening expansion holder including a plurality of
wires at the end of an inner tube which are three
dimensionally expanded when projecting out of an
outer tube to expand an incision of a blood vessel
graft for purposes of inosculation. U. S. Patent
4,705,041 discloses a tissue dilator comprising a
catheter which supports an expandable member, e.g.,
a balloon or a scissor-like member. U. S. Patent
1,878,671 discloses a dilator for opening a body
cavity including an ovate head mounted on a wire
received in a tube which is inserted into the body
cavity. U. S. Patent 4,655,219 discloses a tissue
grasping accessory including a plurality of
flexible grasping arms for use with an endoscopic
instrument to grasp a tissue specimen. U. S.
Patent 4,590,938 discloses a device for removal of
kidney stones through the working channel of an
endoscope including a basket comprising four
outwardly bowed, generally flat spring arms which
are expandable into a bulbous shape and collapsed
when retracted into
