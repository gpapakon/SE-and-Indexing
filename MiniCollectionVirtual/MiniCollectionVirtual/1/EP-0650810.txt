<ABSTRACT>
The device has a feed unit with pressure rollers. The diameter of each roller (8), approx. above the cutting edge (11) of the blade (10), decreases in a step (15). The larger diameter is on the side located in front of the cutting edge in direction of movement, the smaller diameter is one the side behind the cutting edge. Each pressure roller has two cylindrical sections (16,17). The sections are connected by a conical roller section in the area of the diameter step. The larger roller section is slightly conical.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for slicing timber laminae (3) from square timber (1) using a cutter (10), 
the cutting edge (11) which is arranged obliquely in an angle (a) to the conveying 

direction of the squared timber (1), including a feed device (4) pressing the squared 
timber (1) against an opposite timber guide (9), conveying the said timber in its 

longitudinal direction, with the feed device (4) including several pressure rollers (8, 8') 
extending transversally to the conveying direction of the timber, characterised in that the 

diameter of each pressure roller (8, 8') is reduced approximately above the cutting edge 
(11) of the cutter (10) in a diamter step (15) from a larger diameter on the side prior to the 

cutting edge (11) in conveying direction to a smaller diameter on the side behind the 
cutting edge (11) in conveying direction. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that each pressure roller (8) 
includes 2 cylindrical roller sections (16, 17), connected with each other at the diameter 

step (15) by a tapered roller section (18). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that the roller section (16') of a 
larger diameter is designed at least in the case of the pressure roller (8), passed last by the 

squared timber (1), with a diameter increasing towards the roller end, thus being slightly 
tapered.
