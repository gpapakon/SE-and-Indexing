<ABSTRACT>
A photographic processing method is provided 
which avoids folding of a film during storage without a 

problem of bulkiness in the storage and allows easy 
identification of images of the film, and which includes 

the steps of: winding a film finished with printing into 
a cartridge; and providing an index print representing a 

content of the film to the cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic
processing methods and, more particularly, to a
photographic processing method which allows one to tell
the content of a developed film wound into a cartridge at
a glance.It is a conventional practice to cut a developed
film into several pieces to store it within a pouch of
translucent film (hereinafter referred to as "film
sheet"). If a multiplicity of films are to be stored,
many film sheets are needed therefor, which results in
problems that the film sheets become significantly bulky
and resources are wastefully used therefor. There is
another problem that images of a film in such a film sheet
are hard to identify and, hence, each piece of the film
must be taken out from the film sheet and held directly to
the light for its identification. In this case, care
should be taken so as not to fold the negative film or
leave a fingerprint thereon.Also on the part of the dealers concerned,
in case that a developed film accommodated in a film sheet
is returned to a customer, time and labor are needed to
cut the film, and if the film is to be extra-printed,
troublesome operations would be further needed therefor
due to the film cut into several pieces. Furthermore, a
used cartridge of the film must be disposed of.In view of the foregoing circumstances, it is an
object of the present invention to provide a photographic
processing method which is capable of storing films in a
non-bulking fashion, avoiding the films from being folded
during storage and allowing one to know the content of
each film with ease.In accordance with the present invention, there
is provided a photographic processing method comprising 
the steps of: winding a film, which has been developed and printed, into a
cartridge; and providing an index print representing a
content of the film onto the cartridge.Preferably, the index print is affixed to the
cartridge or directly printed thereon.In the photographic processing method of the
present invention, a film once developed is wound into a
cartridge for its storage, and an index print
corresponding to the film is provided onto the cartridge.
