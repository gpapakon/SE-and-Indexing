<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a monodispersed silver
halide emulsion. More precisely this invention relates to a process to prepare
silver halide emulsions by means of a single jet nucleation and a double jet
growth of the silver halide crystals in a gelatin solution. The silver halide
emulsions obtained with the process of the present invention are mainly
composed of silver chloride.The formation of silver halide grains comprises two main steps, the
nucleation step and the crystal growth step. Under some conditions of
precipitation two additional processes, Ostwald ripening and recrystallization,
can occur.As disclosed in T.H.James "The Theory of the Photographic
Process", 4th Edition, Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., New York, the nucleation
step is the process in which there is a population explosion of the number of
crystals when entirely new crystals are created. The crystal growth step
represents the addition of new layers of silver halide to crystals that are already
present. Ostwald ripening occurs principally at higher temperatures, in the
presence of silver halide solvents, and where there is a wide distribution of grain
sizes. Under these conditions a strong tendency exists for the smaller crystals to
dissolve and the large crystals to grow even larger. Recrystallization is the
process in which the composition of the crystals changes. This occurs when
crystals of different composition are present, because the formation of a solid
solution of intermediate composition is thermodynamically favored. The
recrystallization process proceeds more rapidly when silver halide solvents are
present because some of the ions must dissolve and diffuse through the
emulsion to form the mixed crystal phase of intermediate composition.The silver halide grains may be precipitated by a variety of conventional
techniques. The most common techniques, widely employed in the photographic
industry, are the single-jet and double-jet method. In the single jet method a silver nitrate solution is added to a reaction
vessel containing a solution of halides in a protective colloid, usually gelatin. In
this method, because the varying concentration of halides in the solution
determines which silver halide grains are formed, the formed silver halide grains
are a mixture of different kinds of shapes and sizes. This process usually
creates crystals with a certain number of lattice defects, useful to improve
speed, but with disuniform or wide distribution of the particle sizes.In the double-jet method a silver
