<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor 
body (6) of multi-layer structure of two or more semiconductor 

layers (1-4) with alternately changing 
conductivity types, wherein a concentration of a heavy 

metal such as gold or platinum 
for controlling a lifetime of a carrier is lower 

in a peripheral or surrounding region (5) of a cathode-emitter 
layer (4) than in the cathode-emitter layer (4) 

and in a region of another layer (1-3) just below the 
cathode-emitter layer (4). 

The seggregation of gold or platinum atoms (for controlling the 
lifetime) with heavy metal atoms (such as Fe, Cn, Ni) is more likely in 

a peripheral or surrounding region (5) due to the gettering effect of 
phosphorus atoms used for doping the n-type emitter (4). As the amount 

of gold or platinum is small in this peripheral or surrounding region 
(5), the breakdown voltage 

characteristics of the semiconductor device are 
enhanced, and degradation in turn-off characteristics is 

prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relations to a semiconductor 
device having a semiconductor body of multi-layer structure 
made of two or more semiconductor layers with the 
conductivity types of the semiconductor layers being 
changed alternately, and a method of manufacturing the 
same, and more particularly to a semiconductor device 
used as a power device of high-breakdown voltage and 
large capacity such as a rectifier and a method of 
manufacturing the same. FIG. 1 shows a conventional semiconductor device 
(thyristor) of this type. Reference numeral 1 denotes 
a P-type emitter layer, 2 an N-type base layer, and 3 a 
P-type base layer. An N-type emitter layer (cathode 
emitter) 4 is provided in the P-type base layer 3 by 
selective diffusion of impurity. Numeral 5 denotes a 
peripheral or surrounding region of the cathode emitter 
4, which is seen when a semiconductor device body 6 is 
viewed from above (i.e. in plan view). In general, in a thyristor used at a frequency not 
greater than that of a commercial power, in order to 
improve turn-off characteristics, the lifetime of carriers 
needs to be decreased by means of diffusion of a 
heavy metal such as gold or platinum or radiation of 
electron beams. In an electric power device, gold used 
as lifetime killer is superior in terms of relationship 
between on-voltage and turn-off characteristics. Thus,  
 
the diffusion of gold is adopted predominantly, but it 
may be combined with radiation of electron beams. In a gold diffusion process, gold is plated or 
deposited on a semiconductor wafer, and then the gold is 
diffused on the entire surface at temperatures of 750 
to 850Â°C. Thereby, the lifetime is decreased to a 
predetermined value. However, gold tends to segregate 
with such a heavy metal as iron in silicon, and the 
segregation may results in degradation in breakdown 
voltage of the semiconductor device. The heavy metal 
such as iron tends to be gettered by phosphorus within 
the cathode emitter layer 4. Thus, the amount of the 
heavy metal is small in the cathode emitter layer 4 and 
in regions of the other layers just below the cathode 
emitter layer 4, and it tends to be greater in the surrounding 
region 5 than in the regions under the cathode 
emitter layer 4. On the other hand, in order to increase a main 
breakdown voltage, a beveled portion is provided at a 
peripheral wall portion of the surrounding region 5, 
although not shown, and is protected by a passivation 
film. However, a degradation in breakdown voltage 
may occur easier in the
