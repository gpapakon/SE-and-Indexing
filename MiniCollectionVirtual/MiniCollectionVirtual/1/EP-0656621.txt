<ABSTRACT>
A thin film deposited magnetoresistive head 
includes a thin film permanent magnet having a rectangular 

body longer than the magnetoresistive element in the head 
and arranged coplanar and parallel with the 

magnetoresistive element. The permanent magnet (12) has a set 
of tabs (20) that extend in the width direction and the 

magnetoresistive element (14) is located between the tabs. The 
magnetoresistive element is effectively biased by the 

permanent magnet, but the magnet is located at a distance 
from the head medium interface and is therefore not exposed 

to environmental corrosion and does not distort the 
information recorded on the medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thin film 
magnetoresistive reproduce head having a thin film 
permanent magnet for biasing the magnetoresistive 
element in the magnetoresistive head. As magnetic recording is pushed to greater 
storage densities through higher linear densities and 
narrower track widths, magnetoresistive (MR) reproduce 
heads are increasingly recognized as the technology of 
choice. Two technological hurdles presently stand in 
the way of practical application of MR heads: the 
establishment of an optimum bias magnetization 
distribution for linearization of the reproduce signal; 
and stabilization of domain-wall-free, quasi-single 
domain magnetization throughout the central (active) 
region of the MR element. Permanent magnet (PM) 
biasing methods are particularly attractive in that 
they require no power dissipation, nor entail any loss 
of signal due to shunting of the MR sense current. U.S. Patent No. 4,903,158 issued February 20, 
1990 to Smith, teaches the use of a deposited PM 
element having the same or nearly the same geometry as 
the MR element and overlying the MR element. As 
illustrated in Fig. 2, the MR head, generally 
designated as 10, includes: (1) a PM element 12 
deposited on a substrate (not shown) and magnetized in 
the direction of arrow A; and an MR element 14 
deposited over the PM element on the substrate. In the 
descriptions of the drawings that follow, the MR head 
will always be designated 10, the PM element will be 
designated as 12 and the MR element will be designated  
 
14. The deposited PM element 12 provides a very 
spatially non-uniform longitudinal stabilization field 
which complementarily cancels the similarly non-uniform 
internal demagnetization field of the MR element 14 
(which is the fundamental source of single domain 
instability). The underlying deposited PM element does 
not apply excessive longitudinal field to the central 
active area of the MR element 14, which would reduce 
the reproduce sensitivity of the MR head. A problem 
with the MR head taught in the '158 patent is that the 
relatively large magnetic field at the edge of the PM 
element 12 adjacent the head medium interface can 
distort the information recorded on the magnetic 
medium. Yet another problem with the MR head arises 
because the inhomogeneities in the closely adjacent PM 
can perturb the magnetic and/or the reproduce 
properties of the MR element. In addition, the PM head 
of the present invention positions the PM adjacent to 
the planar surface of the of the MR head.
