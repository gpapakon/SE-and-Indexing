<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disposable garments having fixed sides, which are placed in position on the wearer
by inserting the wearer's legs into the leg openings and sliding the disposable garment into position about the wearer's
lower torso. Examples of such disposable garments would include disposable underwear for children (e.g., toddlers) or
adults, and disposable panties which may be used with catamenial devices such as tampons or sanitary napkins. The
present invention relates more particularly to disposable absorbent articles such as training pants, incontinent garments
(panties or briefs), and the like, having separable side seams.Infants and other incontinent individuals wear disposable absorbent articles to receive and contain urine and other
bodily exudates. Absorbent articles having fixed sides have been popular for use on toilet-training children. This is
because it is desirable to have an absorbent article which is very garment-like in appearance and feel so a toilet training
child will distinguish it from a diaper and will easily adjust to cloth undergarments. It is very desirable that the fixed sides
be separable, so the absorbent article can be easily removed. This becomes especially important when the absorbent
article is soiled and the soilage could be spread and smeared if the absorbent article had to be removed by sliding it
down the length of one or both legs.An example of a disposable undergarment having separable side seams is shown in U.S. Patent 4,205,679 issued
to Repke, et al. on June 3, 1980. The Repke, et al. patent discloses a unitary disposable undergarment for use by toilet-training
infants or incontinent adults having a fabric to adhesive bond which is weaker than the fabric itself thereby permitting
the undergarment to be torn apart at the seams for easier removal when the undergarment is soiled.Another disposable garment having separable side seams is shown in U.S. Patent 4,335,425 issued to Jones, et
al. on October 26, 1982. The panty assembly is first folded in half so that the inner surface of the panty is presented
outwardly and the transverse edges are adjacent one another. The transverse edges of the folded panty are then glued
sewn, heat sealed, or the like, to form flanges or fin seams. The panty is then inverted so that the exterior surface of the
panty is presented outwardly and the flanges are presented inwardly in the finished garment. In an especially preferred
embodiment the transverse edges will be sealed using an ultrasonic welder with a 0.5

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a disposable garment which is a
training pant or incontinence garment and which has

separable seams, the method comprising the steps of:

(a) providing a chassis (14) comprising a front
portion (56) having longitudinal side regions (88) made of polymeric material,

elasticated side panels (71), and an elasticated waistband
(34), a rear

portion (58) opposed to said front portion, having
longitudinal side regions (88),

made of a
polymeric material having a similar melting point as said

polymeric material of said longitudinal side regions of
said front portion elasticated side panels

(72), and an elasticated waistband (34), and a crotch portion (57) between said
front portion (56) and said rear portion (58);
(b) superposing said longitudinal side regions (88) of
said front portion with said longitudinal side regions of

said rear portion to form a first seaming area (40) and a
second seaming area (40); 
characterised in
(c) simultaneously sealing and cutting a portion of
said first seaming area by inputting

ultrasonic energy to said first seaming area
sufficient to cause the polymeric material of said first

seaming area to flow and thin away to sever the polymeric
material in a first area (658) while simultaneously bonding

the polymeric material in a marginal area (660) adjacent
said first area to form a first flangeless seam which is

a mass of fused polymeric material, which extends from the
disposable garment 0.79mm (1/32 of an inch) or less and

forms a first leg-opening; and
(d) simultaneously sealing and cutting a portion of
said second seaming area by inputting

ultrasonic energy to said second seaming area 
sufficient to cause the polymeric material of said second

seaming area to flow and thin away to sever the polymeric
material in a first area (658) while simultaneously bonding

the polymeric material in a marginal area (660) adjacent
said first area to form a second flangeless seam which is

a mass of fused polymeric material which extends from the
disposable garment 0.79mm (1/32 of an inch) or less and

forms a second leg-opening, and a waist-opening
substantially encircled by said front waistband and said

rear waistband, said second leg opening being separated
from said first leg opening by said crotch portion.
The method of claim 1 wherein said layers of
material of said longitudinal side regions (88) are made of

the same polymeric material, and preferably comprise a 100% polymeric
nonwoven.
The method of any of the preceding claims comprising
the additional step of securing an absorbent assembly (22)

to said inner cover (46), preferably said absorbent
assembly is an insert comprising a topsheet (24), a

backsheet (26) secured to said topsheet, and an absorbent
core (28) interposed between said topsheet (24) and said

backsheet (26).
