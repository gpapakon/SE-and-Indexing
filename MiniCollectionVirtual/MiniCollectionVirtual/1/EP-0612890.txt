<ABSTRACT>
A sheeting system for trenches consists of sheeting plates (1) opposite one another in pairs and held at a distance apart by struts. The sheeting plates (1) have a wedge-shaped foot part (8) at their bottom edge and can be connected at their top edge to heightening plates (1) by means of connecting devices. The wedge-shaped foot parts (8) are connected to the sheeting plates (1) by means of connecting devices (4, 5') which correspond to the connecting devices (4, 5) serving to connect the heightening plates (1). A simple-to-manipulate connection is obtained if the wedge-shaped foot part (8), has one plate (5') projecting upwards at each of its two ends and opposite the wedge (9). The plates (5') engage in pockets (4) provided on the underside of the sheeting plate (1) and are secured by bolts.

Shoring device for graves, with building slabs (1) 
standing opposite one another in pairs and held at a 

distance by stays, which slabs have a wedge-shaped base 
part (8) and can be connected at their upper edge by 

means of connecting devices with members (1), the 
wedge-shaped base parts (8) being connected by means of 

connecting devices (4,5') with the building slabs (1) 
which correspond to the connecting devices (4,5) 

serving to connect the members (1), 
characterised in 
that
 the members are designed as stacking slabs and the 
wedge-shaped base part (8) has on each of its two ends 

and lying opposite the wedge (9) a slab (5') projecting 
upwards, which engages in pockets on the underside of 

the building slab (1) and is secured by bolts.
