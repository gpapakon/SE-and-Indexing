<ABSTRACT>
Processes are disclosed for incorporating a water-insoluble 
substance in a diffusion resistant form into a hydrophilic colloidal 

layer of an element. In a first process A the water-insoluble 
substance is present during the polycondensation of diol(s) or 

polyol(s) and carboxylic acids, whereby at least 6 mole % of the 
reagents bear a water-solubilizing group, preferably a sulpho group 

in the salt form ; the obtained mixture of polyester and water-insoluble 
substance is then dispersed in an aqueous medium. In an 

alternative process B the polyester is first prepared and then mixed 
homogeneously with the hydrophobe substance by melting in a reactor 

or extruder ; the mixture is then similarly dispersed. The obtained 
latex is then incorporated in a hydrophilic colloidal layer which is 

coated on a support. 
The obtained element can serve as base for a reprographic image, 
e.g. a colour proof image, or can form part of a complete 

photographic material. 
In a preferred embodiment the water-insoluble substance is a 
brightening agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for incorporating a 
water-insoluble substance into a hydrophilic layer, more 
particularly a hydrophilic layer of a photographic element, in a 
diffusion-resistant form. In the colour field of pre-press graphic arts there has been a 
long felt need for a simple and fast technique offering "colour 
proofs" of high quality and reproducibility. Photographically produced colour proofs are a simulation for 
multicolour halftone reproductions as will be produced by successive 
printing in register with the separate standard inks : magenta, 
yellow, cyan and black on a conventional printing press. A process for producing a multicolour pattern using silver 
halide emulsion materials is described in published European Patent 
Application EP 0 185 410. This method comprises the following steps 
: 
(1) the scanningwise exposure of a multicolour original attached to 
a rotating scanner drum in order to obtain separate red light, 
green light and blue light output signals received by 
photon-detectors to produce corresponding electrical signals, 
which are fed into a computer, (2) the computer controlled exposure, of differently coloured 
hardening developable photographic materials each comprising on 
a temporary support one or more hardenable hydrophilic colloid 
layers at least one of which contains dispersed photosensitive 
silver halide, either (3) transferring integrally said hydrophilic colloid layer(s) of a 
first of said exposed photographic materials onto a permanent 
support, which at its surface is less hydrophobic than the 
temporary support, by pressing the permanent support in the 
presence of an aqueous liquid against the hydrophilic colloid 
layer side of said photographic material and removing the 
temporary support, thus leaving said hydrophilic colloid 
layer(s) on said same permanent support, and (4) developing the transferred exposed photosensitive silver halide  
 
with a hardening developing agent to form imagewise hardened 
coloured hydrophilic colloid portions and removing the non-hardened 
colloid portions to leave a coloured relief image on the 
permanent support, and (5) producing a multicolour pattern on said same permanent support 
by repeating the steps (3) and (4) with one or more other 
scanning-wise exposed differently coloured photographic materials, 
the transfer procedure of step (3) being effected in 
image register. The permanent support preferably comprises a paper base and an 
overcoat consisting of a white opaque gelatinous layer.

Process for incorporating a water-insoluble substance into the 
hydrophilic colloidal layer of an element, comprising a support 

and a hydrophilic colloidal layer, in a diffusion-resistant 
form, comprising following steps : 


(1) preparing a homogeneous mixture of a polyester and a water-insoluble 
substance by the following substeps : 


(1.1) preparing a mixture of : 

(a) one or more diol(s) or polyol(s) or a mixture 
thereof, 
(b) one or more di- or polycarboxylic acid(s) or 
lower alkyl ester(s) thereof, or a mixture thereof, with the 

proviso that at least 6 mole % of the compounds of the mixture 
of (a) and (b) bear a water-solubilizing group, 
(c) at least one polymerisation catalyst, 
then either, 
(1.2) adding to said mixture said water-insoluble substance, 
(1.3) effecting a polycondensation reaction by heating, thus 
forming a homogeneous mixture of said water-insoluble substance 

and of a polyester resin containing recurring ester groups 
derived from said diol(s) or polyol(s) and from said di- or 

polycarboxylic acid(s),
 
or,

forming a polyester resin containing recurring ester groups 

derived from said diol(s) or polyol(s) and from said di- or

(4) coating said hydrophilic colloidal coating composition onto 
a support thus forming said element. 
Process according to claim 1 wherein said one or more di- or
