<ABSTRACT>
Device for producing sintered colour samples for dental prostheses, comprising an open mould (1) with a ram (3) guided therein so as to be axially adjustable and mounting a moulding plate (2, 7). The mould (1) is provided with a hollow shaft (4) onto whose end there is screwed an axially displaceable adjusting nut (5) in which the end of the ram (3) is held. The moulding plate (2, 7) is mounted on the ram (3) by means of a spherical head connection (6). The ram (3) can be held correspondingly in the adjusting nut (5) so as to be freely rotatable. The moulding plate is designed in one part and is releasably fastened on the ram (3), or else it is designed in two parts from a support plate (2) and a moulding (7) releasably fastened on the support plate (2).
