<ABSTRACT>
A device for assembling a stack of perforated papers contains a pin (1) provided with a widened head (2), and having a circular thread (4) along its shank. The pin (1) is pushed through the perforations until it makes contact with its head (2). A nut element (6) is screwed onto the threaded shank (4) projecting on the other side. The pin element (1) is produced integrally together with the nut element (6), in a divided form, by injection.

Apparatus for combining perforated papers into stacks having

1.1 a pin member (1), which
1.1.1 has a head (2) and
1.1.2 a shank (3), which
1.1.2.1 is provided with an external thread (4), as well as
1.2 a nut member (6), which
1.2.1 has an internal thread (10) corresponding to the external thread
(4), characterized in that
1.3 the pin member (1) is manufacturable from plastic by injection
moulding in a mould split along one surface and demouldable,
1.4 the internal thread (10) is provided on the nut member (6) and
1.5 the external thread (4) is so placed on the shank that the paper
stack can be fixed between the screw head (2) and the nut member

(6).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the pin member
(1) and the nut member (6) can be manufactured in one piece.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the thread
(10) of the nut member (6) has a single pitch.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
the nut member (6) is shaped onto the tip of the pin (1) by means of

a separating point.
Apparatus according to one of the claims 2 to 4, wherein
the axis of the internal thread (10) of the nut member (6) is at right

angles to the longitudinal axis of the pin (1).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
the thread (4, 10) is a round thread.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
the pitches of the shank thread (4) are flattened in the parting plane

of the two mould halves. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, wherein
the pin member (1) has an elliptical cross-section in its portion

having the thread (4).
Apparatus according to claim 8, wherein the major axis of the ellipse
in the parting surface of the two parts of the mould for manufacturing the

pin member (1).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the longitudinal
axis of the pin member (1) is located in the parting plane of the

two mould halves.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the pin
member (1) is made from a flexible plastic.
