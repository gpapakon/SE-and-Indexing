<DESCRIPTION>
Title: FUNGICIDALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to fungicidally active compounds and derivatives thereof, and processes and microorganisms for producing such compounds. Furthermore the invention relates to fungicidal compositions comprising these compounds, either alone or in combination with other biocides or growth regulators, and to the use of the compounds or compositions of the invention for controlling fungi.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFor a number of years it has been known that various microorganisms produce secondary metabolites exhibiting biological activity and that these can be useful as biocides for controlling diseases and pests.Although progress has been made in the field of identifying and developing biological biocides for controlling various diseases and pests in plants and animals of agronomical importance, most of the pesticides in use are still synthetic compounds that are difficult to decompose in nature and have a broad spectrum of activity.In the last decade there has been an increasing concern for the impact of such pesticides on the environment and the ecosystems surrounding farmlands, and consequently there exists an outspoken need for biocides that are more specific in their activity, and are readily degradable in the natural environment.Natural products can often provide an alternative to synthetic fungicides in that they may have another mode of action, may be more biodegradable and safer in the environment. 

It is consequently an object of the invention to identify novel fungicidally active compounds such as microbial secondary metabolites which originates from natural sources or are direct derivatives of such compounds.US Patent No. 5,008, 187 and Chaiet et al (The Journal of Antibiotics 42 1718-1721, 1989) describe a secondary metabolite of formula lb below as an antifungal agent obtainable by fermentation of a microorganisms belonging to the genus Fusaήum designated MF 5000 (ATCC No. 20883)The invention concerns compounds closely related to the compound described in the above US Patent No. 5,008,187 and their use in agriculture for controlling fungi.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONBriefly stated the invention relates to compounds of the formula I belowwherein R 11 is hydrogen, straight or branch ωed alkyl with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as methyl, straight or branched hydroxyalkyl with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as CH2OH, straight or branched alkylethers with 1 to 6 carbon atoms or optionally substituted aromatic ethers; each R2
