<ABSTRACT>
A device for joining floor boards comprises an elongated, plate-shaped body (1) with legs (2, 3) adapted to engage a longitudinal groove (14, 15) in each of the adjoining floor boards (12, 13). The legs (2, 3) are shaped at a distance from the ends of the plate-shaped body (1) in such a manner that the plate-shaped body (1) supports the boards (12, 13) on each side of the grooves (14 and 15).

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: A device for joining floor boardsTechnical FieldThe invention relates to a device for joining floor boards and comprising an elongated, plate-shaped body with a leg adapted to engage a longitudinal groove in each of the adjoining floor boards.Background ArtDevices for mounting floor boards are known in form of substantially U-shaped clips. The legs of these clips are formed by way of bending and are optionally provided with barbs in such a manner that they are locked in grooves on the bottom side of the floor boards. Such clips are for instance known from EP-PS No. 126,764. The object of the clips is to keep adjoining floor boards together and optionally to press said boards together. As it is a question of relatively thick floor boards of a thickness of from approximately 12 to 22 mm, both the legs of the clips and the grooves receiving said legs can be shaped rather large without strict tolerance standards without acting on the already laid flooring. However, a flooring depends highly on the accuracy of the control of each floor board when subjected to oscil¬ lating effects, such as moisture. When it is a question of production of floorings made of relatively thin, solid floor boards of undressed wood and of a thickness of less than about 12 mm, it turned out to be impossible to obtain completely satisfactory results by means of the existing clips. Accordingly, it has only been possible previously to put down such floorings by gluing the boards together or by carrying out a hidden nailing at the tongue/groove connections. Both fastening methods can cause problems when the flooring is subjected to an oscillating moisture of the atmosphere. A low moistur of the atmosphere causes formation of chinks in the 

 flooring, and a high moisture of the atmosphere has the effect that the flooring has a tendency to bulge up. The thinner the floor board is the faster the moisture in the wood and consequently also the size of the floor board changes or adjusts to the surroundings. Thin floorings have therefore necessitated development of a device eliminating these drawbacks.Description of the InventionThe object of the invention is therefore to provide a device suited for use in connection with thin floorings , especially floorings made of solid undressed wood and subjected to a varying moisture of the atmosphere, and where said device allows a simple and fast laying of the looring.The device according to the invention is characterised in that the legs are shaped at a distance from the ends of the

 Claims .
1. A device for joining floor boards and comprising an elongated, plate-shaped body with a leg adapted to engage a longitudinal groove in each of the adjoining floor boards, c h a r a c t e r i s e d in that the legs (2, 3) are shaped at a distance from the ends of the plate-shaped body (1).
2. A device as claimed in claim 1, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that the legs (2, 3) are shaped by bending two webs (6, 7) projecting away from one another, said webs resulting from a punching out of a substantially I- shaped opening (4, 5) in each end of the plate-shaped body (1), where the two transverse legs of the I extend in the longitudinal direction of the plate-shaped body (1).
3. A device as claimed in claim l or 2, c h a r a c - e r i s e d in that the bent webs (6, 7) are of a substantially hook-shaped cross section.
4. A device as claimed in claim 3, c h a r a c t e r ¬ i s e d in that the bent webs (6, 7) are bent substan- tially perpendicular from the plate-shaped body at a distance from the location where the webs (6, 7) extend from the plate-shaped body (1) and project into the punched out portion.
