<ABSTRACT>
Biodegradable polymer microspheres, preferably formed of zein, are used for in vivo release of erythropoietin (EPO). Examples demonstrate administration of the EPO in zein and polylactides and polymer microspheres to dogs and monkeys, with appropriate increases in blood levels and an increase in reticulocyte counts.

<DESCRIPTION>
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a 34 to 38 kda glycoprotein of 165 amino acids, with approximately 40% of its molecular weight provided by carbohydrate, originally isolated from urine, but subsequently produced by recombinant genetic engineering, that is used to increase red blood cell counts. Normal production of human red blood cells requires the secretion of erythropoietin by the kidney, apparently as the mature glycoprotein. In the steady state this hormone circulates in the blood at a concentration of 10 to 18 milliunits (128-230 picograms) per milliliter. The hormone triggers proliferation and differentiation of a population of receptive stem cells in the bone marrow, stimulates hemoglobin synthesis in maturing erythroid cells, and accelerates release of red cells from the marrow into circulation, thereby increasing the red cell mass and ameliorating the hypoxic conditions.Patients with deficiencies of EPO often suffer severe anemia. EPO is used to treat patients with anemia associated with chronic renal failure, including patients on dialysis (end stage renal disease) and patients not on dialysis, as well as anemia associated with AIDS. EPO is administered as an intravenous bolus three times a week for patients on dialysis and as a subcutaneous injection three times a week for patients not on dialysis. For patients who are receiving EPO on a chronic basis subcutaneously, the frequent injections result in peak and valley plasma levels as well as problems with patient compliance.It is desirable to find a method and means for oral or parenteral delivery of EPO that is economical, safe and effective.An oral formulation would be a significant advance in drug administration. An oral formulation would require significant enteric protection from the degradative pathways in the gastrointestinal tract. Microencapsulation of EPO in a suitable polymeric system could protect the incorporated protein from the harsh environment of the intestinal tract. Any microencapsulation process would require mild formulation conditions such as low temperature, physiological pH, and a compatible solvent system for preservation of the biological activity of the EPO.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for controlled, delayed release of EPO when administered orally or parenterally.Biodegradable polymer microspheres, preferably formed of zein, are used for in vivo release of erythropoietin (EPO). The microspheres are preferably administered enterally, but can be administered by other routes, for
