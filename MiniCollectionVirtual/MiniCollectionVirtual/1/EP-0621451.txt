<ABSTRACT>
The modular floor sub-structure is provided 
with discrete floor modules having bottom surfaces and 

sides extending upwardly to support paired floor tiles. 
The modules are interconnected to sit upon a floor 

surface and, in turn, support rack-mounted computer 
components. Select ones of the floor modules contain air 

cooling coils and blowers, while others are provided 
with uninterrupted power supplies and still others 

retain power distribution networks. The cooling system 
of a given module as well as the UPS components of 

another given module are provided having a capacity for 
supporting one computer component. Where more than one 

computer component is to be supported by the system, 
then additional modules are provided to develop an 

expanded elevated floor surface with power and heat 
removal servicing specific to each computer component. A 

step arrangement is provided, the interior of which is 
utilized to retain flexible chilled water conduits for 

servicing the cooling coils within adjacently disposed 
floor modules as well as for providing servicing access 

to the cooling coils, the UPS system and a power 
distribution console. The step structure pivots from a 

seated to an open position to provide service access.

<DESCRIPTION>
Traditionally, industrial data centers have been designed to accommodate relatively 
large "mainframe" computer systems. These systems include stand-alone hinged cabinet 
contained control processing units, tape guide systems, disk drives, printers, control 
consoles, and the like. When assembled within a data center, the systems have required a 
relatively larger amount of floor area within a given building, as well as a carefully 
controlled environment. Control over that environment requires a dedicated, sealed 
computer room which is serviced by corresponding dedicated air-conditioning systems. In 
similar fashion, critical equipment within the room is serviced by dedicated uninterruptible 
power supplies. Because of the extensive amount of electrical interconnection required 
both for power supply and system communication, these computer rooms typically contain 
raised floors formed of tiles supported upon frames beneath which the complex cable 
networks can be laid. Generally, the provision of such computer rooms has represented a 
substantial financial investment on the part of the user. Over the recent past, the computer industry has introduced processing systems 
employing more modern, modular electronics and supporting components permitting their 
rack mounted installation. Such modularized designs provide for substantial flexibility in 
accommodating for varying processing demands. For example, these systems readily are 
expanded incrementally as the growth of processing needs on the part of the user increases. 
As a consequence of improved design, such systems exhibit lower heat loads, lower noise 
output, and a compactness in packaging such that they are promoted for installation within 
the environment of a business office as opposed to a data center. One such system, for 
example, is identified under the trademark "AS/400", marketed by International Business 
Machines Corporation. This system offers a family of processor related modular units 
generally employing rack-mounted packaging. Cabinetry carrying the rack mounted 
modules will, for example, have nominal dimensions of 26 inches width by 36 inches 
depth, and 62 inches height. To facilitate their delivery to an intended operating location, 
they are supported for movement upon casters. With the racks fully loaded, the equipment 
may, for example, exhibit a heat load of 11,000 BTUs per hour, representing a demand for  
 
about one ton of air-conditioning. Similarly, the units will call for an uninterrupted power 
supply load
