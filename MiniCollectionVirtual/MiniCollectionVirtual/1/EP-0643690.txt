<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to salts of desferrioxamine-B, and to pharmaceutical compositions
containing such salts as active ingredients.The preparations of desferrioxamine-B and pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts
thereof are described in U.S. Patent No. 3247197 and FR-M-1.898. The amine and salts thereof such as
those described in the above mentioned U.S. patent exhibit a marked ability to form stable
complexes with trivalent metal ions, especially Fe3+. Consequently, desferrioxamine-B
(as the methanesulphonate salt) is of immense importance as a pharmacological
iron-chelator in the treatment of iron-overload diseases such as beta-thalassemia. As the
only currently marketed drug which is available for the treatment of thalassemia,
desferrioxamine-B is vital to the survival of patients suffering from this disease.Administration of desferrioxamine-B (as the methane sulphonate salt) via slow (8 to 12
hour) subcutaneous infusion is now widely accepted as the route necessary to control
transfusional iron overload in beta-thalassemics. However, such a mode of treatment is
laborious, uncomfortable and inconvenient for the patient, and involves high costs.
Patient compliance is poor: non-compliance with iron-chelation therapy has been
suspected to be the most important cause of death amongst British thalassemics. Hence
there is a great need for simpler, more convenient and cheaper iron-chelation therapy,
criteria which would be met via an oral dosage form.This need has been apparent for a long time, and numerous attempts have been made over
many years to obtain a form of desferrioxamine-B which is effective in iron-overload
therapy when administered orally. Such attempts have included formulations based on the
methanesulphonate salt, other known salts and other derivatives - see WO 85/03290 and US 5185368. All of these attempts
have proved unsuccessful.It has now been found, in accordance with the present invention, that novel salts of
desferrioxamine-B having enhanced lipophilicity provide a means of improving the
clinical efficiency of the drug to such an extent that it is effective when administered
orally. These salts can exhibit unexpectedly high lipophilicity under physiological 
conditions, whilst at the same time having good stability and effective iron-chelating
properties.Accordingly, the present invention provides, in one aspect, a salt of formula

where X denotes a group of formula

Y denotes a group of formula

and R denotes the residue of an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic sulphonic acid having
