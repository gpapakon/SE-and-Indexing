<ABSTRACT>
A control system for controlling both a lean 
combustion engine (E) equipped with a swirl control valve 

(1) and an automatic transmission (A). The control system 
comprises: a shift detector (2) for detecting that a shift 

is being executed in the automatic transmission; and a 
valve control inhibitor (3) for inhibiting the switching 

the ON/OFF state of the swirl control valve (1) in the 
course of the shift in the automatic transmission. A 

regulation level changer (7) is provided for changing the 
regulation level of the oil pressure of the automatic 

transmission in accordance with the ON/OFF state of the 
swirl control valve (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
controlling both an engine having its torque highly 
fluctuating, when the ON/OFF state of a control valve 
disposed in an intake port is switched, and an automatic 
transmission connected to the engine. As is well known in the art, an automatic transmission 
for vehicles is set to a predetermined one of 
gear stages when the power transmission path of a gear 
train is changed by friction device including clutches 
and brakes. This friction device has its load (or 
torque) capacity varied with not only the coefficients 
of friction and the diameters of frictional members 
but also the pressure of engagement (i.e., the line 
pressure). This oil pressure is controlled in accordance 
with the load to be applied to the friction device. 
When in shifting, on the other hand, not only 
the engine speed but also the speeds of various rotating  
 
members such as gears also vary. For this shift, 
therefore, the friction device is caused to slip by 
changing the oil pressure applied to them gently for a 
predetermined time period so that the inertial energy 
accompanying the change in the rotational speeds may 
be absorbed to prevent an abrupt change in the torque 
of an output shaft, namely, the shift shocks. The aforementioned engagement pressure is controlled 
through a change in the level of pressure regulation 
by applying a pilot pressure corresponding to 
the engine load to a regulator valve for regulating 
the oil pressure generated by a hydraulic pump. Specifically, 
either the throttle pressure to be fed from 
a throttle valve having its regulation level varied by 
a throttle cam or the throttle pressure sent from a 
linear solenoid valve to be controlled according to 
the throttle opening is applied as the pilot pressure 
to the regulator valve to change the regulation level. 
On the other hand, the oil pressure for engaging the 
friction device may be controlled when in shifting by 
applying either the oil pressure (i.e., the line pressure) 
regulated by the aforementioned regulator valve 
or the oil pressure coming from an accumulator control 
valve to the back pressure chamber of an accumulator. 
Incidentally, an example of changing the regulation  
 
level by using the linear solenoid valve is disclosed 
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 215157/1987. In the aforementioned ordinary control method existing 
in the prior art, the line pressure will rise 
as the throttle opening increases, so that the torque 
capacity of the friction device is augmented

<CLAIMS>
A control system for controlling both: an engine (E) 
having a plurality of cylinders (11), a plurality of 

intake ports (12,13) formed individually for said cylinders 
(11), a plurality of intake valves (14,15) for opening or 

closing said intake ports (12,13) individually for said 
cylinders, and a control valve (1,10) for opening or 

closing one (12) of the intake ports (12,13) of each of 
said cylinders (11); a transmission (A) connected to said 

engine (E); valve control means (4,16) for opening said 
control valve (1,10) when an engine load is high, and 

closing said control valve (1,10) when the engine load is 
low; and air/fuel ration control means (5,16) for making an 

air/fuel ratio, when said control valve (1,10) is closed, 
higher than that when said control valve (1,10) is open; 

characterised in that said transmission is an automatic 
transmission (A) having friction means (Fd) to be engaged 

by an oil pressure regulated by pressure regulation means 
(8,17) and by regulation level change means (7,17) for 

changing a regulation level by said pressure regulation 
means (8,17) in accordance with the ON/OFF state of said 

control valve (1,10), and in that said valve control means 
(4,16) outputs a control valve switching signal to said 

regulation level change means (7,17) and switches said 
control valve (1,10) after said regulation level change 

means (7,17) has changed the regulation level. 
A control system according to Claim 1, 

wherein said pressure regulation means (8,17) includes 
an accumulator and an accumulator back pressure control 

valve, and 
wherein said regulation level change means (7,17) 
raises the pilot pressure for said accumulator back 

pressure control valve, when said control valve (1,10) is 
open, and drops the same when said control valve (1,10) is 

closed.
