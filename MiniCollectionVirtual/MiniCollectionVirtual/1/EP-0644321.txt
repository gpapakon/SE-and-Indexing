<ABSTRACT>
A compact, short stroke breakover throttle lever assembly (10) which 
prevents damage to high pressure internal combustion engine fuel pumps 

is provided. The compact, short stroke breakover throttle lever (10) 
of the 

present invention includes a throttle lever element (22) 
and a throttle control 

link element (20) which are coaxial and move synchronously 
with a fuel pump 

throttle shaft that are pivotally connected at an end of the 
throttle lever 

element (22) a maximum distance from the fuel pump throttle shaft. 
A central 

throttle control link connection and return spring connection (25) 
are provided 

on the throttle control link element (22). The pivotal movement of 
the throttle 

control link element (20) relative to the throttle lever element (22) is 
limited by the 

travel limits of a spring engaging element (32,34) 
which cooperates with a spring (40) 

to hold the throttle lever element (22) and throttle control 
link element (20) in alignment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to throttle levers for internal
combustion engines and specifically to a breakover throttle lever which
avoids damage to the fuel pump and associated structures when excessive
force is applied to the throttle lever.In particular, the present invention
relates to a throttle lever assembly according to the preamble of
claim 1.Throttle operating devices have long been employed in automotive
and other vehicular internal combustion engines. These operating devices
typically include a throttle lever attached to a throttle shaft and operatively
connected to an associated throttle control linkage. The throttle control
linkage is operatively connected to a foot-operated throttle pedal or
"accelerator" or to another type of operator-actuated throttle control
element within the vehicle's passenger compartment. This permits the
operator to control the action of a fuel supply system, such as a fuel
injection system or throttle valve, through the throttle control linkage and
associated throttle lever simply by pressing down or releasing the throttle
pedal or by moving the throttle control element.Throttle levers are normally arranged to move between two
positions: an idle position wherein sufficient fuel is supplied to the engine
so that it will run at a predetermined idling speed, and a full throttle
position wherein a maximum amount of fuel is supplied to the engine. The
idle and full throttle positions are normally defined by adjustable stops. 
When the accelerator is fully depressed or the throttle control element is
fully advanced, the fuel supply control is in a full throttle position, and the
engine is capable of running at a high speed. A return spring is typically
used to bias the throttle lever to the setting required to maintain a preset
engine idle speed when pressure on the throttle pedal is released or when
the throttle control is fully retracted.Various structures have been proposed to insure control over engine
throttling and to avoid the creation of an "uncontrolled" engine wherein the
operator loses control over the position of the throttle shaft. One
circumstance which can overstress the throttle lever and potentially lead to
loss of throttle shaft control occurs when the throttle shaft encounters a
stop while continued advancing force is applied to the throttle lever through
the throttle control linkage. Typically a "breakover" mechanism is
provided in situations of this sort to protect the throttle shaft against such
excessive force. The throttle lever

<CLAIMS>
Throttle lever assembly for operating a throttle shaft adapted to control the flow
of fuel to an internal combustion engine as the throttle shaft is moved between

an idle position and a full throttle position in response to a throttle control lever
means (20), comprising:


a) a throttle lever means (22) adapted to be connected with the throttle shaft
for moving the throttle shaft between the idle and full throttle positions in

response to movement of the throttle control lever means (20);
b) throttle link means connected to the throttle lever means (22) and to the
throttle control lever means (20) for limiting the degree of force which may

be applied to the throttle lever means (22) when the throttle shaft reaches at
least one of the idle and full throttle positions;
c) pivotal connector means (25) located at an end of the throttle lever means
(22) distal from the throttle shaft for pivotally connecting the throttle lever

means (22) and the throttle control lever means (20);
characterized in that
d) the throttle control lever means (20) extends from the pivotal connector
means (25) towards the throttle shaft substantially in alignment with the

throttle lever means (22), and
e) a throttle control connector means (18) is located at the throttle control lever
means (20) substantially centrally between the pivotal connector means (25)

and the throttle shaft for engaging a linkage element for the throttle control
lever means (20).
Throttle lever assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that the pivotal
connector means (25) includes a spring biasing means for biasing said throttle

lever means (22) and said throttle control lever means (20) into a normal operating
position, wherein said throttle lever means (22) and said throttle control lever

means (20) are axially aligned and rotate synchronously with said throttle
shaft. 
Throttle lever assembly according to claim 2, characterized in that said throttle
lever means (22) includes a first spring engaging portion and said throttle control

lever means (20) includes a second spring engaging portion and said spring
biasing means includes a spring (40) having a pair of legs (42, 44), wherein one

of said legs (42, 44) is engaged by said first spring engaging portion and the
other of said legs (42, 44) is engaged by said second spring engaging portion.
Throttle lever assembly according to claim 3, characterized in that said throttle
lever means (22) includes an aperture means (38) for receiving said second

spring engaging portion, wherein said aperture means (38) is sized relative to
said second spring engaging portion to limit the lateral movement thereof in the

event said leg (42, 44) of said spring (40) is prevented from contacting said second
spring engaging portion.
Throttle lever assembly according to claim 4, characterized in that said second
spring engaging portion is formed on a link member configured to conform to

the configuration of said throttle control lever means (20) and secured to said
throttle control lever means (20) so that said second spring engaging portion

that said throttle control lever means (20) is rotatable from said normal operating

position to a breakover position when the force on said throttle control connector
means (18) exceeds the force of said spring biasing means.
