<ABSTRACT>
Before and/or during the execution of a spinning programme, the laundry drum is operated in a mass-determining segment M within three phases A. The first phase is characterised by a delayed increase in speed to a final speed n1 above the starting speed and below the resonant speed. The second phase B has a constant desired speed equal to the final speed n1 of the ramp. In the third phase C, the laundry drum runs down drivelessly to a minimum speed n2 which is still higher than the laundry breakaway speed. From the moment t1 when the drive is switched off to the moment t2 when the minimum speed is reached, the time span TC, which is a measure for the mass of the laundry, is measured. This detection of the loading can be carried out in an extremely simple way, is considerably more accurate than conventional methods and can be repeated at any time. A measurement of residual moisture for the purpose of checking the spinning result is likewise possible.

Method of determining the mass of wet laundry in a laundry drum, which is drivable
by a universal motor, which is regulated in rotational speed, with the aid of regulating

magnitudes, characterised in that before and/or during the performance of a spinning
program the laundry drum is operated in a mass determining section (M) within three

phases (A, B, C), in which the first phase (A) is distinguished by a delayed rise in rotational
speed up to a final rotational speed (n1) above the laying-against rotational speed (nA), at

which the laundry lies against the drum shell, and close to but below the resonance
rotational speed (nR) of the drive system, the second phase (B) has a constant target

rotational speed equal to the final rotational speed (n1) of the ramp and in the third phase
(C) the laundry drum runs down without drive to a minimum rotational speed (n2) which is

still sufficiently high that the previously formed laundry ring does not detach or detaches
only to a small part from the drum shell, and that this time period (TC) from the instant (t1)

at the switching-off of the drive to the instant (t2) at the attainment of the minimum
rotational speed (n2) is measured and is a measure for the mass of the laundry.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the mean power of the drive
motor is measured during the second phase (B) and is a measure for the braking couple at

the drum, which is taken into account as a variable in the determination of mass.
Method according to claim 2 with assumption of a constant mains voltage,
characterised in that the mean phase lead angle of the rotational speed regulating

equipment of the drive motor is determined for the determination of power of the motor.
Method according to claim 2 without assumption of a constant mains voltage,
characterised in that the mean phase lead angle of the rotational speed regulating

equipment of the drive motor is determined for the determination of power of the motor and
during that in addition the mains voltage is measured and taken into account in the

determination of the braking couple as a correction value.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that at least one
further determination of mass takes place during the performance of the spinning program. 
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that the value from the further
determination of mass is set into relationship with the value of a determination of mass,

which is undertaken before or at the start of the preceding washing process, of the dry
laundry in order to determine the attained spinning effect in the form of a value for a

residual moisture still remaining.
Method according to claim 5, characterised in that the value from the further
determination of mass is set into relationship with the value from the preceding

determination of mass and, with use of a value for the determination of the absorption
capability of the laundry undertaken before or at the beginning of the preceding washing

process, the residual moisture present at the further determination of mass is inferred.
