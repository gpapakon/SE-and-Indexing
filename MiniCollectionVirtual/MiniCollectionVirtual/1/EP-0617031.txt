<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new series of azole derivatives of
general formula I having a potent antifungal activity. The invention also
relates to a process for their preparation, to the pharmaceutical compositions
containing them and to their use for the manufacture of a medicament for
the treatment of fungal diseases.The compounds of the present invention are antifungal agents whose
mechanism of action is based on the inhibition of the biosynthesis of
ergosterol in fungi. Other antifungal agents having this type of activity are
known in the medical practice and are currently used in therapy. Some of
them are applied in the topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin,
vagina and nails, such as candidiasis, dermatophytosis and pityriasis. More
recently discovered compounds are used orally in the treatment of systemic
and organ mycoses, such as systemic candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcal
meningitis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis,
sporotrichosis, chromoblastomycosis and blastomycosis. These diseases
appear frequently in immunosupressed patients, such as AIDS and cancer
patients. Some other compounds related to the ones of the present invention
are also used as agrochemicals to protect plants from a variety of fungi.EP 510700, EP 480215, EP 54974, Chem. Pharm. Bull, vol 40, 1992, pages
661-665, Chem. Pharm. Bull., vol 39, 1991, pages 2581-2589, and Chemical
Abstracts, vol 119, abstract 139186j all disclose imidazolyl- or triazolylalkanol
derivatives having antifungal activity. However, none of these compounds
possess the ring structure of the compounds of the present invention.Chem. Pharm. Bull, vol 40, 1992, pages 661-665 and WO 92/17474
disclose 3-carboxy-2-aryl-1-triazolyl-2-butanols in racemic form.European patent application EP 332,387 describes, among others, certain
antifungal compounds of general formula

wherein:
Ar is a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or two halogen or
trifluoromethyl groups; R2 is C1-C6 alkyl, haloalkyl, optionally substituted
phenyl, naphtyl or an heterocycle; and R1 is H or C1-C4 alkyl. These
compounds are useful for the treatment of fungal diseases in animals and
plants.In a study aimed at improving the activity of these compounds, we
have found that an increase in the lenght of the alkyl radical R1 in a
compound of the above formula (that is to say the change of methyl for ethyl,  
propyl and butyl) translates into a progressive loss of in vivo activity. But,
surprisingly, the introduction of an heteroatom into the
