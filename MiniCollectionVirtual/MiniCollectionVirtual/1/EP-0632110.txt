Luster pigments comprising coated platelet-shaped 
substrates wherein the coating comprises a layer comprising 

bismuth vanadate. 
Luster pigments as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
bismuth vanadate layer further comprises phosphate, 

borate, sulfate, silicate and/or metal oxide or metal 
oxide hydrate. 
Luster pigments as claimed in claim 1 or 2 
wherein the bismuth vanadate layer further comprises 

oxide or oxide hydrate of an alkali earth metal, silicon 
and/or titanium. 
Luster pigments as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
3 wherein the outer layer is an essentially colorless 

layer comprising metal oxide, metal silicate and/or metal 
phosphate. 
Luster pigments as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
4 wherein the substrate is a silicate with or without a 

coating of metal oxide. 
A process for preparing the luster pigments of 
any of claims 1 to 5, which comprises using an alkaline 

vanadate solution to precipitate bismuth vanadate from an 
acidic bismuth salt solution in the presence of the 

substrate particles to be coated and of a base and in the 
presence or absence of dissolved phosphates, borates 

and/or hydrolyzable metal salts, filtering off the coated 
substrate particles thus obtained and washing and drying 

them. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
alkaline vanadate solution is added to the acidic bismuth 

salt solution in which the substrate particles are  
 

suspended, the mixture is adjusted with a base to pH 2-6, 
stirred at that pH for about one hour, then adjusted 

again to pH 5-8, heated at constant pH to the reflux 
temperature, and then further heated for 0.5-5 hours, and 

the pigment is isolated. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
acidic bismuth salt solution in which the substrate 

particles are suspended is added to the alkaline vanadate 
solution, the mixture is adjusted with a base to pH 3-6.5, 

the pH is kept constant with further base during the 
heating to 100°C until the pH does not decrease again, 

and after 0.5-5 h the pigment is isolated and heat-treated 
at 300-600° for 0.5-5 hours. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 6 to 8, 
wherein the substrate particles coated with a bismuth 

vanadate layer are further coated in aqueous suspension 
with an outer layer of metal oxide or metal oxide hydrate 

by hydrolysis of a metal salt or with an outer layer of 
metal silicate or metal phosphate by precipitation of a 

metal silicate or metal phosphate and the pigment is 
isolated in a conventional manner. 
The use of the luster pigments of any of claims 
1 to 5 for coloring paints, printing inks, plastics, 

glasses, ceramic products and decorative cosmetic 
preparations.
