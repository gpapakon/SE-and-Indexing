<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a 
method of fabricating a superconducting thin film. This invention specifically 
relates to a copper oxide superconductor. J.G. Bednorz and K.A. Muller discovered a high-Tc 
superconductor including a perovskite oxide compound of the Ba-La-Cu-O 
system (J.G. Bednorz and K.A. Muller: Zeitshrift Fur Physik 
B, Condensed Matter, Vol. 64, 189-193, 1986). After the discovery 
by J.G. Bednorz and K.A. Muller, other perovskite oxide 
superconductors have also been discovered which have various 
chemical compositions. S. N. Putilin et al discovered that a mercury-bearing 
perovskite oxide compound of HgBa2CuO4+δ was superconducting 
below a temperature of 94 K (S. N. Putilin et al: Nature, Vol. 362, p. 
226, 1993). This superconducting oxide compound is thought to be 
of a crystal structure in which perovskite Ba2CuO4 layers containing 
CuO6 octahedrons are separated by 1-atom layers mainly containing 
mercury atoms. It should be noted that 1-atom layers mean layers 
having thicknesses corresponding to one atom. When the HgBa2CuO4+δ superconductor is practically used  
 
and operated as a superconductor at the liquid nitrogen 
temperature (77 K), its superconducting transition temperature Tc 
being 94 K is close to the lower limit of a usable transition 
temperature range in consideration of a necessary temperature 
margin. Accordingly, superconducting transition temperatures Tc 
higher than 94 K are desirable for sure use and operation of 
superconductors at the liquid nitrogen temperature. Since a mercury vapor pressure is very high, mercury-containing 
oxide compounds are generally made in a sealed 
container where oxygen gas and mercury vapor are held in 
pressurized states. Such methods of making mercury-containing 
oxide compounds are complicated, and thus have a problem in 
industrial application thereof. Available HgBa2CuO4+δ superconductors are usually in the form 
of ceramics. One reason for this fact is that a mercury vapor 
pressure is very high. Generally, thin-film configurations of 
superconductors are desirable for their applications to electronic 
devices. Accordingly, thin-films of HgBa2CuO4+δ superconductors 
have been desired. Furthermore, regarding applications of thin-film oxide 
superconductors to electronic devices, each of the superconductors 
is sometimes required to be made of a single crystal without grain 
boundaries. Some cases require a laminate of a thin-film oxide 
superconductor and a layer of other material. To meet such 
requirements, it
