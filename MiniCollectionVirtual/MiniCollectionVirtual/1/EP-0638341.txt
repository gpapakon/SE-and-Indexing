<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ski brake which is intended to slow the motion of a ski. The brake comprises two braking arms (2, 3) having two active braking segments (4, 5) which can be moved in rotation between an active braking position and an inactive rest position about a substantially transverse spindle (10, 11) carried by a base (20), two actuation elements (12, 13), for the braking arms, which extend beyond the transverse articulation spindle, and a return spring (35). It is characterised in that the braking arms (2, 3) are independent, in that the return spring (35) is independent of the braking arms, in that it laterally has two means (36, 37) for tight fitting onto the actuation elements (12, 13) of the braking arms, and a loop (40) in its central region, which loop descends towards the base, the bottom part (41) of which bears against the upper surface of the base.

Ski brake designed to slow the travel of a ski in motion following the 
release of the boot, comprising two brake arms (2, 3, 89, 90) with two active braking 

segments (4, 5) movable in rotation between an active braking position and an inactive 
rest position around a substantially transverse axis (10, 11) borne by a base (20) or a 

backplate (93), two actuators (12, 13) of the brake arms which extend beyond the 
transverse axis of articulation, a return spring (35, 85) acting on the actuators of the 

brake arms in order to bring the active brake segments elastically back into active braking 
position,
 
   characterized by the fact that the brake arms (2, 3) are independent, that the return 

spring (35, 85) is independent of the brake arms, that it possesses laterally two means 
(36, 37) for connection to the actuators (12, 13) of the brake arms, and, in its central 

area, a loop (40, 88) extending downward toward the base, whose lower base (41) rests 
against the upper surface of the base. 
Brake according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the connection 
means are windings (36, 37) made of the wire constituting the spring which extend on 

each side of the loop (40).  
 
Brake according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that the actuators (12, 
13) incorporate, at their upper end, two transverse connection segments (14, 15) 

substantially aligned with each other on which the windings (36, 37) of the spring are 
fitted. 
Brake according to claim 3, characterized by the fact that each winding (35, 
36) incorporates, toward the outside, a hook-shaped end (38, 39) which grips the actuator 

(12, 13) of the brake arms. 
Brake according to claim 4, characterized by the fact that the loop (40) 
incorporates an inclination to the horizontal greater than that of the plane formed by the 

actuators (16, 17). 
Brake according to claim 5, characterized by the fact that the wire of the 
windings (36, 37) is wound on the actuators (38, 39) in the direction of tightening the 

windings on the actuators when the loop (40) is brought into the plane of the actuators 
(12, 13). 
Brake according to claim 2, characterized by the fact that, at rest, the axes 
of the windings (36, 37) of the spring form an obtuse angle between them.  

 
Brake according to claim 7, characterized by the fact that the obtuse angle 
is formed opposite the loop (40), so that, after assembly, the loop (40) is prestressed in 

open position. 
Brake according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the base covers 
a backplate (26, 93) which, forwardly of the transverse axis of articulation of the arms, 

has a hook (43) open to the rear in which the base (41) of the loop (40) is engaged in the 
active position of the brake arms. 
Ski brake according to claim 7, characterized by the fact that, in the active 
braking position, the base (41) of the loop (40) is prestressed in the hook (43) which 

holds it in place.
