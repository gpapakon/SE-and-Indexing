<ABSTRACT>
A mounting hook and clip (30) for merchandise display incorporates a display and 
identification panel (37) on one of two spaced limbs (34, 37) between which a garment 

is entrained, for example through the intermediary of a folded mounting card (40) 
forming opposed side panels (41, 43), with a laterally offset locking tongue (39) on one 

of the elements (37) penetrating either or both slots (47, 49) in one or both card side 
panels (41, 43).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mountings, fastenings and supports, such as hooks and
clips, and is particularly, but not exclusively, concerned with mounting hooks and
clips, such as are used in retail environments for mounting merchandise on display
racks at a point of sale.Such a display rack typically carries stock of merchandise in an accessible array,
through which a customer can browse and examine goods - if necessary by
temporarily removing and replacing individual items from the rack.A great diversity of such mounting hooks has been devised hitherto for bespoke
mounting purposes, either directly or indirectly (ie through an intermediate element,
as discussed later) - and of these one kind is typically moulded from synthetic plastics
material configured as a shallow profiled strip.Such plastic strips may integrate with an intervening product information and
identification display mounting card, to which an individual product item (eg garment
or garment set, such as a pair of socks) is attached - thus spreading the mounting
loads over a larger surface area and reducing the risk of tearing of either the mounting
card or indeed the fabric of the product itself.Typically for a garment mounting, a display card is folded to embrace the garment
thickness and a proprietary adhesive bonding or mechanical fastening, such as a
plastics staple or rivet, is fired through the combined depth of folded card (doubled)
and the garment in order to secure he attachment of the card and garment.However, such card has limited mechanical robustness itself and so, in order to mount
the 'carded' garment upon a merchandiser display and storage rack, a supplementary
integrated hook and clip element is provided for interaction with the card, rather than
the garment direct.In this way, the product (eg garment) mounting loads are spread between the plastics
and card.WO-A-90/00505 (Wilkins) discloses an earlier mounting hook proposal which employs a
hook with depending outwardly splayed legs, to fit within a slot in a mounting card
(typically at a fold in the card), by inwardly resiliently deformable deflection of the legs.
The hook (automatically) becomes entrained in the card after passage through the
card slot - by outward restorative movement of the legs, whose ends then have a
span greater than the slot width, thereby inhibiting hook separation from the card.However, garments, mounting hooks and display cards are not necessarily produced
by the same manufacturer, or on the same site, and the display information is very
particula

<CLAIMS>
A mounting, comprising

a mutually entrainable clip (10) and card (20),
for attachment to an item to be mounted,
the card having a location aperture (29) for the clip,
the clip having an integral hook (13),
a leg portion (17) and a tongue portion (19),
the leg and tongue portions being marginally spaced
to receive the card,
with the tongue (19) inserted through the card aperture.
A mounting, as claimed in Claim 1,

with an additional limb (34),
spaced from said leg by a bridge (35),
to receive said card (20),
at least part of the tongue (39) lying in, or closely adjacent,
the plane of the limb (34),
whereby to entrain the card (20)

between the limb (34) and leg (17),
once the tongue has penetrated the card aperture (49).
A mounting as claimed in Claim 2,

comprising a ledge (38) between the tongue (39) and the leg (37),
whereby laterally to offset the tongue (39)

towards the limb (34).
A mounting as claimed in Claim 2 or 3,

incorporating a display panel on the leg (37).
A mounting as claimed in Claims 2 to 4,

wherein the limb (34) is configured as a perimeter frame
embracing the leg (37) and tongue (39).
A mounting, as claimed in any of the preceding claims,

adapted for mounting a garment,
through the intermediary of a mounting card (20)
with a face in direct garment fastening contact,
the card (20) being folded

and the garment nesting between folds,
an aperture (27) in the card, at or adjacent the fold,
to receive the mounting clip,
and a further aperture (29),
in one of the card fold panels (21),
to receive the tongue (19),
whereby the clip and card are secured together

and thus with the entrained garment.
