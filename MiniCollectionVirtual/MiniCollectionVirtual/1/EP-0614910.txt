<CLAIMS>
A purified form of streptogramins, characterized
in that it consists of the combination of one or more

group B components of streptogramins, of general formula:

in which A
1
 is a radical of general formula:

for which R' is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl radical and
Y is a hydrogen atom, a methylamino radical or a

dimethylamino radical, 
R is an ethyl radical or, when R' represents a hydrogen
atom, R can also represent a methyl radical, and
R
1
 and R
2
 represent a hydrogen atom, or alternatively
A
1
 is a radical of formula:

R is an isobutyl radical, and
R
1
 is a hydroxyl radical and R
2
 is a methyl radical,

and one more group A minority components of
streptogramins, of general formula:


in which R'' is a hydrogen atom or a methyl or ethyl
radical, in the state of a cocrystallizate, of a

coprecipitate or of a physical mixture of the powders.
A purified form of streptogramins according to
claim 1, characterized in that it contains less than 6 %

of impurities.
A purified form of streptogramins according to
one of claims 1 and 2, consisting of a combination in

proportions of 10:90 to 90:10 (by weight), respectively,
of one or more group B components of streptogramins and

one or more group A minority components of streptogramins

as are defined in claim 1, in the state of a
coprecipitate or of a physical mixture of the powders.
A purifed form of streptogramins according to one
of claims 1 to 3, consisting of a combination of 20:80 to 

80:20 (by weight), respectively, of one or more group B
components of streptogramins and one or more group A

minority components of streptogramins as are defined in
claim 1, in the state of a coprecipitate or of a physical

mixture of the powders.
A purified form of streptogramins according to
claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it is a

cocrystallized compound of one or more group B components
of streptogramins and one or more group A minority

components of streptogramins as are defined in claim 1,
in a mole ratio of the order of 1:2.
Use of a cocrystallized compound according to
claim 5, for the preparation of a purified form of

streptogramins according to one of claims 1 to 4.
Use of a cocrystallized comound according to
claim 5, for the purification of a group A minority

component of streptogramins as is defined in claim 1.
A process for preparing a purified form of
streptogramins according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that the group A component(s) of
streptogramins is/are cocrystallized with the group B

component(s) of streptogramins as are defined in claim 1,
and the cocrystallized compound obtained is then, if need

be, combined with the appropriate group A or B
component(s) to obtain a combination in the desired

proportions.
A process for purifying a group A minority
component of streptogramins which is defined in claim 1,

characterized in that a cocrystallized compound of this
component with one or more group B components of

streptogramins is prepared, and the group B component(s)
is/are then removed by treatment in an acid medium.
A purified group A component of streptogramins as
is defined in claim 1, when it is obtained via a

cocrystallized compound according to claim 5.

formula: 



in which R'' is a hydrogen atom or an ethyl radical.

streptogramins as are defined in claim 1, for the

preparation of cocrystallizates with one or more group B
components of streptogramins or their derivatives.
Cocrystallized compounds consisting of one or
more group B components of streptogramins or their

derivatives, and one or more group A minority components

it contains a purified form of streptogramins according

to one of claims 1 to 5, in the pure state or in the
presence of any compatible and pharmaceutically

acceptable diluent or adjuvant.
