<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stirrer lid for paint containers on paint mixing machines and to the process for manufacturing these lids. This stirrer lid for paint containers on mixing machines, of the type with a frustoconical closure edge, comprising a dome-shaped main body (5), fitted with a pouring lip (spout) and with a stirrer shaft in the middle, is characterised in that it has an annular ring (7) which is coaxially fixed to the base of the body and has a downward-tapering frustoconical cross-section, the said ring (7) forming the closure edge of the lid.

A stirring cover for paint cans on stirring machines of the type 
with a frustoconical closure edge, comprising a cap-shaped main body (5) 

provided with a pourer and a stirrer shaft at its centre, characterised in 
that it comprises an independent annular ring (7) fixed coaxially to the 

base of the body and of a downwardly tapering frustoconical section, said 
ring (7) forming the closure edge of the cover. 
A stirring cover according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
configuration of the ring (7) is variable, being matched to the 

corresponding opening edge (13) of the receiving can (3), the body (5) of 
the cover remaining unchanged for a given range of capacities of the cans, 

for example 1, 3 or 5 litres. 
A stirring cover according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised 
in that said ring (7) is made of a metal alloy and is of suitable 

mechanical strength and hardness to ensure closure integrity in gripping 
relationship on the opening edge (13) of the cans, the closure pressure 

being afforded in conventional manner by fixing cams (21) which are fixed 
with respect to the body of the cover and in engagement below the opening 

edge (13) of the cans, or by hoop portions which are fixed with respect to 
the can and engaged over the cover. 
A stirring cover according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said ring (7) is fixed to the cover by crimping by 

means of lower steps which are fixed with respect to the body (5) of the 
cover and preferably a lower annular collar (11) which extends over the 

whole of its external periphery. 
A stirring cover according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised 
in that said ring (7) is riveted to the body (5) of the cover.  

 
A stirring cover according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said ring (7) is produced by machining. 
A stirring cover according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said ring (7) serves as a support for a closure seal 

interposed between said ring and the can edge (13), said seal being 
received in a suitable housing, for example a groove, which is formed on 

the ring, which seal may vary according to the configuration of the cans. 
A stirring cover according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that said ring (7) is produced by moulding in a specific 

ring mould cavity simultaneously with that of the body of the cover which 
is moulded in an i
nvariable mould cavity. 
A process for producing a stirring cover as defined in any one of 
claims 1 to 5, 7 and 8 characterised in that it comprises the following 

steps: 

moulding the cover body (5) and a ring (7) of frustoconical section 
intended to form the closure edge of the cover, in a body mould cavity and 

in a separate ring mould cavity respectively, preferably simultaneously in 
a cycle for moulding the cover, the body mould cavity remaining unchanged 

for cycles for the production of different series of covers in a given 
range of capacities of the cans to be equipped, while the ring mould 

cavity is changed according to said series, and 
assembly of the ring (7) and the cover body (5) by which the ring 
(7) is fixed to the base of the cover coaxially with the body for example 

by means of a suitable press tool in which it is crimped or riveted to 
said body. 
A process for producing a stirring cover according to claim 9 
characterised in that said assembly operation comprises pushing back on to 

the front circular face of the ring (7) a peripheral collar (11) provided 
at the base of the body (5), by means of which the ring is crimped to the 

body of the cover.  
 
A process for producing a stirring cover according to claim 10 
characterised in that the collar (11) is fitted by crimping on to the ring 

(7) on its front face, being turned slightly towards the interior relative 
to the vertical.
