Pneumatic brake-booster comprising a casing (10) 
inside which is a piston formed by a hub (20) and by a 

skirt (14) and which, with the aid of an unrolling 
membrane (12), defines a front chamber (16) permanently 

connected to a partial vacuum source and a back chamber 
(18) connected selectively to the front chamber (16) when 

a first valve passage (56, 58) is opened or to the 
atmosphere when a second valve passage (76, 78) is 

opened, the first and second valve passages (56, 58; 76, 
78) being formed by valve seats (58, 78) co-operating 

with annular valve surfaces (56, 76), and being actuated 
by a control rod (35) capable of bearing, through the 

intermediary of a plunger(32), against one of the faces 
of a reaction disk (42) securely attached to a push rod 

(44), the skirt (14) of the piston being movable in axial 
translation with respect to the hub (20) over a predetermined 

distance (D), a spring (74) being disposed between 
the skirt (14) and the plunger (32) and constituting a 

spring for returning the control rod (35) and acting as 
a shutter valve spring, characterized in that the plunger 

(32) includes a cylindrical part (70) sliding in leak-tight 
manner around a cylindrical part (15) of the skirt 

(14) of the piston, the valve seat (78) of the second 
valve passage (76, 78) being formed on the hub (20) 

following a circle of diameter equal or very close to 
that of the cylindrical part (15) of the skirt (14). 
Booster according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the hub (20) is formed with an annular front end 

(48) slidable received in an annular groove (50) formed 
on the back face of the skirt (14). 
Booster according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the predetermined distance (D) is equal to the axial 

distance at rest between a retaining ring (52) disposed 
in an aperture (54) formed in the skirt (14) and a 

step (90) formed in the hub (20) facing the retaining 
ring (52). 
Booster according to claims 2 and 3, characterized  
 

in that the aperture (54) is formed in one of the 
walls of the annular groove (50) and in that the step 

(90) is formed in the annular front end (48) of the 
hub (20). 
Booster according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that at least one one [sic]
 of 
the valve seats (58, 78) is formed by a bead (58, 78) 

formed on the hub (20) of the piston, and co-operating 
with an annular surface (56, 76) formed on the skirt (14) 

or the plunger (32). 
Booster according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that at least one of the valve seats 

(56, 76) is formed by a bead (58, 78) formed on the skirt 
(14) or the plunger (32) and co-operating with an annular 

surface formed on the hub (20) of the piston.
