<ABSTRACT>
An intracorporeal knot tying device. The knot tying 
device comprises a cannula tube having a proximal end and 

a distal end and passage therethrough. A suture is 
movably mounted within the tubular passage. A needle is 

mounted to the distal end of the suture. The cannula has 
in its distal end a slit or a distally extending arm for 

retaining the suture and maneuvering the suture while 
tying an intracorporeal knot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention relates is 
surgical instruments, in particular, surgical instruments 
used with surgical sutures for tying knots. Endoscopic surgical ("endosurgical") procedures are 
becoming widely accepted within the medical community and 
by the patient population. Endosurgical procedures, which 
include arthroscopy, laparoscopy, thoracoscopy and 
endoscopy, have been shown to have many benefits. The 
benefits include reduced post-operative recovery time, 
reduced stay in the hospital, reduced pain and reduced 
scarring. Numerous endosurgical instruments have been developed 
to assist the surgeon in performing endoscopic procedures. 
The instruments include trocars and trocar cannulas, 
ligating clip appliers, stapling devices, graspers, 
endoscopic pouches, and the like. In addition, endoscopic 
suturing devices have been developed which assist the 
surgeon in suturing within a body cavity. In most endosurgical procedures, trocars are inserted 
into a body cavity in order to give the surgeon access to 
the body cavity. Conventional trocars typically consist 
of an elongated piercing obturator concentrically housed 
within a trocar cannula. Trocar cannulas typically 
consist of an elongated tube mounted in a hollow handle. 
After the trocar is inserted into the body cavity, and  
 
positioned properly, the surgeon removes the trocar 
obturator thereby leaving the trocar cannula as a passage 
to the body cavity. Several trocar cannulas are typically 
employed in an endoscopic procedure. An endoscope is 
inserted through one of the trocar cannulas so that the 
surgeon can observe the interior of the body cavity. The 
remaining trocar cannulas are used for inserting various 
endosurgical instruments. It can be appreciated that suturing during an 
endoscopic procedure presents challenges to both the 
surgeon and the equipment manufacturer. Various 
endoscopic surgical devices have been developed which 
allow the surgeon to suture remotely in a patient's body 
cavity. For example, endoscopic loop suturing devices 
have been developed. The loop suture devices consist of 
a pretied loop mounted to a cannula. Other endoscopic 
suturing devices have been developed such as pre-tied 
knots mounted to cannulas. Although the endosurgical suturing devices which have 
been developed are suitable for their intended purposes, 
there is a continuing need in the rapidly progressing 
endoscopic surgical arts for new instruments useful in 
endoscopic suturing. Therefore, it is an object of the

<CLAIMS>
An intracorporeal knot tying device, comprising: 
   a cannula tube, the tube having a proximal end and a 

distal end, the tube further having a longitudinal passage 
therethrough, a longitudinal axis, and an inner surface and 

an outer surface; 
   means mounted to the distal end of the cannula for 

engaging a suture. 
An intracorporeal knot tying device, comprising: 
   a cannula tube, the tube having a proximal end and a 

distal end, the tube further having a longitudinal passage 
therethrough; and 

   a slit in the distal end of the tube extending 
proximally and radially inward a sufficient distance to 

effectively retain a suture. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the suture engaging means 
comprises a first arm member extending radially outward from 

the outer surface of the distal end of the cannula, said 
member having an outer end, and a second arm member 

extending distally from the outer end of the first member, 
substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the 

cannula, such that there is a space between the second arm 
member and the outer surface of the distal end of the 

cannula effective to retain a surface. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the suture engaging means 
comprises a cylindrical member having a proximal and a 

distal end, said cylindrical member comprising a plurality 
of adjacent connected coils and a distal arm member 

extending distally from the distal end of the cylindrical 
member. 
The device of any preceding claim wherein the cannula 
tube additionally comprises a distal tapered end. 
The device of any preceding claim further comprising a 
suture mounted in the passage, the suture having a distal 

end and a proximal end wherein the distal end of the suture 
extends through the passage beyond the distal end of the 

cannula. 
The device of claim 6 further comprising a surgical 
needle mounted to the distal end of the suture. 
The suture of claim 6 or claim 7 further comprising a 
loop means in the distal end of the suture. 
The combination comprising: 
   an intracorporeal knot tying device according to any of 

claims 1 to 4; and 
   a suture. 
A method of tying an intracorporeal knot comprising the 
steps of: 

   inserting a cannula, said cannula comprising a proximal 
end and a distal end and a longitudinal axis, into a body 

cavity, said cannula further comprising means for engaging 
a suture mounted to the distal end thereof and a 

longitudinal passage therethrough, said cannula additionally 
comprising a suture mounted in said longitudinal passage, 

said suture having a distal end extending from the distal 
end of the cannula, such that at least the distal end of the 

cannula is in said body cavity; 
   engaging a section of the distal end of the suture in 

the suture engaging means; 
   rotating the cannula at least about two revolutions 

about its longitudinal axis to form at least about two loops 
of suture about the distal end of the cannula; 

   releasing the suture from the suture engaging means; 
   releasing the suture loops onto the suture; and 

   forming a surgical knot in the suture.
