<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of removing oil from waste oil consisting of oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions using compounds selected from (A) the group comprising quaternary pyridinium and ammonium salts and betaine with at least one alkyl group having 6 to 22 C-atoms and/or (B) the group comprising tertiary or quarternary polyamines with mean molecular weights lying between 50,000 and 250,000 Daltons, and subsequently separating the two phases.

A process for dewatering industrial spent oils in the form of water-in-oil 
emulsions or oil-in-water emulsions with an oil content of greater than 15% 

by weight which accumulate as an oil-rich phase in the working up of 
industrial oil-in-water emulsions by creaming in a mechanical separator, by 

concentration using membrane filtration processes or by primary demulsification, 
characterized in that one or more cationic amine compounds from 

the following groups: 

A) quaternary pyridinium or ammonium salts or betaines containing at 
least one C
6-22
 alkyl group, 
B) tertiary or quaternary polyamines with average molecular weights of 
50,000 to 250,000 dalton 
 
is/are dispersed in the emulsion to induce ph
ase separation. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the compounds 
of group A) are selected from N-alkyl pyridinium salts containing a C
10-16
 alkyl 
substituent, trimethyl alkyl ammonium salts containing a C
10-18
 alkyl group, 
dimethyl benzyl alkyl ammonium salts containing a C
10-16
 alkyl group, dimethyl 
dialkyl ammonium salts containing two identical or different C
6-12
 alkyl groups 
and dimethyl alkyl ammonium betaines containing a C
8-18
 alkyl group. 
A process as claimed in one or both of claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the compounds of group B) are selected from polymers containing the 

following groups: 

  
 

and/or 

 
where X
n-
 is a preferably inorganic ion carrying one, two or three negative 
charges. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that dewatering agents of group(s) A) and/or B) are combined with ethoxylation 

products of C
10-18
 and preferably C
12-16
 fatty amines or fatty alcohols with 
5 to 29 moles of ethylene oxide and with ethoxylation/propoxylation products 

of C
10-18
 and preferably C
10-16
 fatty amines or fatty alcohols with 4 to 10 moles 
of ethylene oxide followed by 1 to 4 moles of propylene oxide, the fatty 

alcohols or fatty amines preferably being saturated compounds or product 
mixtures of the type obtained from natural fats and oils and the alkylene oxide 

chains having a conventional or narrow homolog distribution. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that dewatering agents of group(s) A) and/or B) are combined with one or 

more of the following agents: polymers and/or oligomers of ethylene oxide 
and/or 1,2-propylene oxide, alkoxylated phenolic resins, block polymers or 

copolymers of ethylene and 1,2-propylene oxide crosslinked with diisocyanates, 
dicarboxylic acids, formaldehyde and/or diglycidyl ether and polyether 

urethanes. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the dewatering agents are used in a total concentration of 5 ppm to 

60,000 ppm and preferably in a total concentration of 100 ppm to 30,000 
ppm, based on the total quantity of liquid to be dewatered.  

 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 6, characterized in 
that dewatering is carried out at temperatures of 15 to 95°C and preferably 

at temperatures of 20 to 80°C. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the spent oil to be dewatered is a water-in-oil emulsion obtained by 

primary demulsification of an oil-in-water emulsion. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that phase separation 
by centrifugation is carried out after the dewatering agent has been 

mixed with the emulsion.
