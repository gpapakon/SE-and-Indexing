<CLAIMS>
Method of metallising non-conductive surfaces, 
characterised by the following steps: 


a) possible etch-cleaning, 
b) conditioning by a chelate former and/or cationic, 
surface-active substance, 
c) possible etch-cleaning, 
d) possible treatment with a preliminary immersion 
solution, 
e) treatment with a colloidal acidic solution of a 
precious metal, which solution is stabilised by an organic 

polymer, 
f) treatment with a solution which contains, as one or 
more sulphur compounds, sulphinic acid, sulphites, 

bisulphites, thiosulphates, dithionites, dithionates and/or 
tetrathionates, and 
g) galvanic metallisation. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the colloidal 
acidic solution of method step e) is produced by mixing 

acid, precious metal and/or precious metal salt, organic 
protective colloid and a reducing agent in a solvent. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
palladium, platinium, rhodium, ruthenium, silver and gold 

are used as the precious metals. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein polyvinyl 
pyridine, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 

polyvinyl acetate, polyacrylates or copolymers or mixtures 
are used as the organic polymer. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein quaternary 
polyvinyl imidazole, triethanol amine or monoethanol amine 

is used as the conditioning agent.  
 
Use of hydroxymethane sulphinic acid in a method 
for metallising non-conductive surfaces.
