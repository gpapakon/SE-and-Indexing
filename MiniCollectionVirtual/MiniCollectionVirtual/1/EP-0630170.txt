<CLAIMS>
Glazing pane equipped with at least one accessory (4, 20,
24) supplied with electrical signals from electrical equipment

situated outside the glazing pane, the electrical connection
being implemented by means of at least one electrical

connection device comprising conductive elements (5, 6, 11, 12,
13, 25, 27, 29, 57, 62) disposed on the glazing-pane substrate

forming part of the glazing pane, the said device consisting of
at least one cable (10, 19, 26, 47, 52, 69, 70, 71, 72)

situated outside the glazing pane and comprising conductive
filaments (14, 16, 30, 38, 53, 61, 64), possibly covered with a

sheath (17, 34, 35, 36, 54, 55, 80), the accessory being
connected to the conductive elements which are themselves

connected to the cable, 
characterised in that
 the cable also
passes in the area of the glazing pane beyond the area at which

the cable arrives at the edge of the glazing pane and is fixed
to the substrate.
Glazing pane according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

one and the same cable electrically connects several
accessories (4, 20) supplied with electrical signals.
Glazing pane according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that

the glazing pane comprises only one cable outlet (21).
Glazing pane according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the cable is fixed either directly or indirectly to the
substrate by means of a foam comprising an adhesive layer on

each of its faces.
Glazing pane according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at 
least one conductive element of the electrical connection is

covered with a coating (18, 28, 48, 56, 65).
Glazing pane according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that

the material constituting the coating is chosen from amongst
the following materials: polyvinyl chloride, polyurethane, EPDM

(ethylene propylene diene monomer), polysulphide, polyamide or
a mixture of polyurethane and polyamide.
Glazing pane according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that

the coating is a profiled piece (65) covering a conductive
element, in particular the conductive filaments of the cable

and/or an electrical connection.
Glazing pane according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that

the profiled piece comprises a cavity within which a hot-melt
glue is injected.
Glazing pane according to Claim 7 or Claim 8, 
characterised
in that
 the conductive element is supported by a base (66).
Glazing pane according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that

the coating is a sheath (36) within which the conductive
filaments of the cable are embedded, the said sheath being in

particular fixed to the substrate by adhesive bonding.
Glazing pane according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that

the profile of the sheath comprises at least one lip (37)
applied against the glazing pane.
Glazing pane according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that

the sheath is extruded. 
Glazing pane according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that

the cable is composed of two superimposed sheaths.
Glazing pane according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that

the sheaths are coextruded.
Glazing pane according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the conductive filaments of the cable are in direct electrical
contact with at least one accessory supplied with electrical

signals.
Glazing pane according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the cable, at its exit from the glazing
pane, passes across the boundary between two areas, the area

(C) referred to as the sealing area and the area (B) referred
to as the non-sealing area, the part of the connection intended

to cross the boundary between these two areas being embedded in
an attached piece (74) comprising a fixing means intended to

fix it to the substrate.
Glazing pane according to Claim 17, 
characterised in that

the fixing means is a part or a lug (87) fixed to the attached
piece, the said lug or part being intended to be fixed to the

substrate, in particular by adhesive bonding.
Glazing pane according to Claim 16 or Claim 17,

characterised in that
 the fixing means is a mechanical
anchoring between the attached piece and an auxiliary piece

intended to be fixed to the substrate.
Glazing pane according to Claim 18, 
characterised in that

the mechanical anchoring is provided by a bulge (81) situated
on a piece, attached or auxiliary, the other piece comprising 

the complementary part.
Glazing pane according to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the attached piece (74) comprises a lip
(92) intended to provide the continuity of a lip, attached

moreover to a mounting joint in order to facilitate the
mounting of the glazing pane in an opening.
