<ABSTRACT>
Expandable, modular decorative frame for the supports or bases of electrical units, consisting of a standard regular module with symmetric corners or vertices, fitted internally and diagonally with female anchor points for force-fitting on male means situated on the base-casings, which are substantially flat and in line with the base of the frame, including a floating radial segment for elastic connection with the vertex and a free, insertion-fitting end in the shape of a clip, the said frame possibly being produced in double, triple or more versions by modular and successive sizing of two parallel (longitudinal) sides of the module, while keeping the vertices of the latter unchanged. This frame is recommended for single or combined electrical unit supports, with single or multiple components in horizontal and vertical projection, or in both directions.

Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases 
for electrical apparatus, which is constituted by a modular frame of 

standardized format, characterized in that it comprises a regular square 
moulding (2) with symmetrical corners (5) of convex semi-arch outer 

profile (2) and straight inner planes (3) perpendicular to the base, 
with female anchoring means (4) projecting axially along the bisectrix 

of the apices (5) of said corners, substantially flat and in bundles or 
level with the base or lower face (15) of the frame (1). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases 
of electrical apparatus, which comprises a moulding (1) of 

standardized square format, according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it is only necessary to dimension modularly, in repeated and successive 

manner, two longitudinal parallel sides of the frame (1), while 
maintaining the apices (5) invariably symmetrical, to obtain double, 

triple or successive versions of said frames (1) and/or incorporating 
equidistant female anchoring means (4) proportional to each 

dimensioning. 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases 
of electrical apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 

female anchorings (4) comprise a radial ramification merging with the 
bisectrix of the angle (5) composed of two sections, one free or in 

overhang, for female fitting (6) and the other internal (10a), elastic and 
for connection to said apex (5). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases 
of electrical apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 

free section of the anchoring ramification (4) is an annular fork (6) 
provided with a radial opening (+/- 45Â°) (7) comprising vertical edges 

in re-entrant chamfer or bevel (8) and, inside, with a centred toric rib 
(7a) which acts as male fitting for locking.  

 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases 
of electrical apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 

inner elastic section for connection to the anchoring apex comprises an 
annular rib (9) associated with a flat angle gusset (10a) and intersected 

by a bisectrix groove (10) axial to the apex (5) that it also intersects on 
a portion (11). 
Polydimensional modular decorative frame for supports or bases 
of electrical apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 and 3 to 5, 

characterized in that, for its locking, the male anchoring means 
comprise a cylindrical stud (12) of diameter adapted to the inner 

diameter of the fork (6) of the anchoring (4) abutting against and 
tangential to the edges (13) of the inner framework (14) of the base-frames 

(14a) of reversed cone-formed projection and provided 
complementarily with a likewise toric notch (16) acting as female 

fitting for locking.
