<ABSTRACT>
The defluxing agent for flux residue after soldering 
contains an acid (preferably an organic acid, and 

particularly an acid stronger than abietic acid; for 
example, acrylic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, 

benzoic acid) and an organic solvent (for example, 
xylene, benzyl acetate, methyl α-hydroxyisobutyrate, 

cyclohexanone, methyl β-methoxyisobutyrate), and if 
necessary it further contains a monohydric alcohol, a 

surfactant and a corrosion inhibitor. Rinsing is 
preferably performed after the cleaning, using a solvent 

which is miscible with the defluxing agent, in order to 
completely remove the acid. There is also disclosed a 

cleaning apparatus which may be generally used for this 
and other cleaning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a defluxing
agent, a cleaning method and a cleaning apparatus, and
especially it relates to a defluxing agent, cleaning
method and cleaning apparatus for non-chlorine-type
defluxing after soldering.The production and use of chlorine-type organic
solvents which deplete the ozone layer are recently being
ever more regulated by the legislatures of participant
nations to the Montreal Protocol. Since chlorine-type
organic solvents have been used in the past as defluxing
agents for cleaning flux after soldering, there has been
a great acceleration in the development of defluxing
agents which do not use chlorine-type organic solvents.During the production of electronic circuit
parts by soldering, the post-solder flux has
conventionally been cleaned for removal using
1,1,1-trichloroethane.1,1,1-trichloroethane not only has a high
ability to dissolve rosin, the main component of post-solder
flux, but it also has a low toxicity and no
inflammation point, giving it superior safety as a
defluxing agent, and it has thus been indispensable for
the cleaning of flux.Since 1,1,1-trichloroethane is to be completely
banned in 1996, from that time on the cleaning of post-solder
flux during the production of electronic circuit
parts by soldering will become more difficult, and
because the long-term reliability of the electronic
circuit components will be reduced as a result of
corrosive substances contained in the flux, the
development of a substitute defluxing agent for 1,1,1-trichloroethane 
has become an urgent issue.With the prolonged heating during soldering the
acid components of the rosin contained in the flux
react with the solder to cause chemical reactions such
as the production of salts (metal carboxylic acid
salts), etc., thus becoming insoluble to the solvent,
and therefore the substitute defluxing agent for 1,1,1-trichloroethane
must not simply dissolve the rosin
prior to heating but must also dissolve the altered
flux components which have reacted due to heat.Nevertheless, because in the past most research
has centered on chlorine-type solvents such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
no non-chlorine-type solvents which
dissolve heat-altered flux have been known.WO-A-91/06690 discloses a mixture for cleaning
printed circuit boards containing at least one
aliphatic hydrocarbon of an average 8 - 20 carbon atoms
and at least one organic compound with at least one
polar group. Carboxylic acid is one example of the
polar organic compound.US-A-3 994 751 discloses an activator for
