<ABSTRACT>
What is proposed is a conveyor, especially continuous conveyor, for single hangers, which is inclined at an angle  beta  relative to a horizontal axis A extending perpendicularly to the direction of transport T and the conveying means of which forms a chain 1 driven in rotation. The chain 1 has triangular drivers 3 which project above the individual chain links 2 and which serve for transporting the hanger hooks. The chain 1 is guided in a two-part profile 7, the deflection also taking place directly in the profile. Altogether, a low overall height can be achieved with such a design, so that hangers which have only a short hook 20 can also be conveyed.

A conveyor, especially a continuous conveyor for articles of clothing hanging 
on hangers (21) provided with hooks (20), with a circulatorily driven chain 

(1) which transports the hangers (21) by their hooks (20), characterised in 
that the chain (1) is inclined at an angle (Î²) to the horizontal (A) extending 

orthogonally to the direction of transport (T) and that individual chain links 
(2) are provided with three-sided drive portions (3) which project upwardly 

beyond the chain (1). 
A conveyor according to claim 1, characterised in that the leading edge (3') 
of the drive portion (3) viewed in the direction of transport (T) extends 

orthogonally to the direction of transport (T). 
A conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the drive 
portions (3) are arranged off-centre with respect to the longitudinal axis (18) 

of the chain (1). 
A conveyor according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that the chain runs guided in a transversely-divided section (7) and the - 

with respect to the direction of transport (T) - anterior (7a) and posterior 
(7b) section halves formed through the dividing joint (10) are each provided 

with a recess (blind holes 5, 6), wherein the openings lie opposite each 
other in the fitted position of the section halves (7a, 7b) and together 

accommodate a compression spring (4). 
A conveyor according to claim 4, characterised in that the section (7) is 
provided with limbs (8, 9) which extend parallel to the chain (1) and in the 

direction of the hook (20) and are of different height (H
8
, H
9
). 
A conveyor according to claim 5, characterised in that the limbs (8, 9) slope 
downwardly at the anterior end (7a') of the section (7). 
A conveyor according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterised 
in that a horizontally-extending guard strip (11) is arranged above the upper 

strand (1') of the chain (1) and runs in the direction of transport (T) for 
almost the full length of the strand (1'). 
A conveyor according to claim 7, characterised in that the guard strip (11) 
can be displaced in a vertical direction against the force of at least one 

spring (12). 
A conveyor according to claim 5, characterised in that the limbs (8, 9) serve 
to guide the hook (20).  

 
A conveyor according to claim 4, characterised in that the section (7) 
directly serves to deflect the strands (1', 1'') of the chain (1) and to guide 

the chain (1) during the deflection process.
