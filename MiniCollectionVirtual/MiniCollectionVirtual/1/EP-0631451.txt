<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the strategies for 
the handover (handoff) of the communication zones allocated 
to the base stations at the mobile station in the cellular 
system such as the portable mobile telephone system. In order to deal with the increase of the subscribers 
of the mobile communication service, it is popular to adopt 
the cellular scheme in which a transmission power of each 
of the base stations constituting the service area is set 
low to keep the communication zone called cell indicating a 
communication supported region of each base station to be 
in a relatively small range, such that the identical 
frequency can be utilized repeatedly at geographically 
separated regions. In this cellular scheme, the radius of 
the cell is made smaller for the purpose of improving the 
frequency utilization efficiency, but the smaller cell 
radius in turn requires more frequent channel switching 
(handover or handoff) operations in conjunction with the 
movement of the mobile station. The channel switching is carried out when the 
monitored communication quality at the channels used 
between the base station and the mobile station become 
lower than the prescribed reference value, or when there 
appears a base station capable of providing the higher 
communication quality than that provided by the currently 
communicating base station above the prescribed reference  
 
value, by acquiring the idle channel at the switching 
target base station. Here, in order to eliminate the 
influence due to the unnecessary handover, the comparison 
of the communication quality with the reference value is 
carried out by taking an average over a prescribed period 
of time. The relationships of a forceful call cut off rate and 
a frequency of unnecesary handover, i.e., a number of 
unnecessary channel switching operations which occur at 
locations where neighboring cells are overlapping with each 
other which indicates the control load, with respect to the 
channel switching control parameters such as the averaging 
time and the reference value for judging a necessity of 
channel switching are summarized in the table shown in Fig. 
1, which shows a result of the computer simulation using 6 
m/sec as the moving speed of the mobile station. It is 
noted here that the reference value for judging a necessity 
of channel switching indicates the reference value for the 
received signal level difference between the currently 
located cell and neighboring cell, while the averaging time 
indicates the number of
