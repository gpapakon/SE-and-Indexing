<ABSTRACT>
A passenger seat, preferably for installation in land vehicles, watercraft and aircraft, has a seat base frame which has supporting feet. There can be attached to the supporting feet at least one crossbar which is designed as a box-type spar 1 and has attachment webs 2, 3 connected in one piece thereto. At least one box 4, 5 of the box-type spar 1 is divided by at least one web 6, 7. The web extends from a wall 8, 9 of the box 4, 5, which wall extends horizontally when the box-type spar has been installed, to a wall 10, 11 of the box lying opposite the wall 8, 9. At least one of the walls connected by the web thickens towards the web.

A passenger seat, preferably for installation in land vehicles, 
water-craft and aircraft, comprising a seat support free having support 

legs on which can be fixed at least one transverse bearer which is in the 
form of a box beam member (1) and which has fixing limbs (2, 3) 

integrally connected thereto, wherein there are at least two boxes (4, 5) 
and at least one box (4, 5) of the box beam member (1) is subdivided by 

at least one limb (6, 7) which extends from a wall (8, 9) of the box (4, 
5), which wall extends horizontally in the installed condition, to a wall 

(10, 11) of the box, which is opposite thereto, characterised in that at 
least one (10, 11) of the walls (8, 9, 10, 11) which are connected by the 

limb (6, 7) increases in thickness towards the limb (6, 7), the boxes (4, 
5) of the beam member being of such dimensions that both in respect of 

width and also in respect of height they are each more than half the 
corresponding dimensions of the beam member whereby they would 

respectively project into the region of the respective other box, and 
overlapping is prevented by virtue of the fact that extending through the 

overlapping region is a limb (18) which is common to both boxes (4, 5) 
and which extends diagonally through the overlapping region. 
A passenger seat according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
wall (10, 11) increases in thickness in such a way that on both sides of 

the limb (6, 7) the plane (12, 13, 14, 15) of the side of the wall (10, 
11), which is in the box, forms an angle of about 10Â° relative to the 

plane (16, 17) of the side of the wall (10, 11), which is outside the 
box. 
A passenger seat according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
thickening extends into the box (4, 5). 
A passenger seat according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised  
 

in that the fixing limbs (2, 3) are in the form of fixing rails with T-shaped 
grooves whose walls (19) which are at the outside of the beam 

member are increased in thickness. 
A passenger seat according to claim 4 characterised in that the 
walls of the groove (2, 3), which are at the outside of the beam member, 

are approximately three times as thick as the remaining limbs forming the 
T-shaped groove. 
A passenger seat according to claim 4 or claim 5 characterised 
in that the limb which upwardly delimits the crossbar of the T-shape 

forms the one wall (8, 9) of the box (4, 5). 
A passenger seat according to claim 6 characterised in that the 
overlap is so great that the corresponding walls of the boxes of the beam 

member are arranged displaced relative to each other by about 7 to 10% of 
the extent of the box of the beam member, which extent is delimited by 

the corresponding walls.
