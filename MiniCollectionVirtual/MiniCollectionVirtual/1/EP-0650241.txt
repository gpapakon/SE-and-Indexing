<ABSTRACT>
A permanent magnet rotor (20) for an electric motor has a shaft (30), a coupler 
(40) mounted on the shaft, a flux ring (50) fitted to the coupler (40) and located 

within a ring magnet (60). The flux ring (50) is a split ring having a nominal 
outside diameter greater than the inside diameter of the magnet and is keyed to the 

coupler (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric motor and in particular to a 
permanent magnet rotor for an electric motor. Permanent magnet rotors are well known and are used, for example, in 
brushless D.C. motors and synchronous motors. Various methods have 
been tried to attach the magnets to the rotor. A common construction 
is to use a ring magnet rather than individual bar magnets to overcome 
centrifugal forces. These are usually sintered magnets formed as 
simple rings with ground internal and external surfaces to provide 
accurate diameters. The return path for the magnetic field in the rotor is provided by a 
flux ring made from an iron tube, a stamped stack of steel laminations 
or a solid ring. The flux ring needs to have a highly accurate outside 
diameter to match the inside diameter of the magnet as the magnet is a 
press fit on the flux ring. If the interference is too great the 
magnet may crack. If the interference is too little, the magnet may be 
loose on the flux ring resulting in slippage under load. It is known to use a plastics material coupler to connect the flux ring 
to the motor shaft. The coupler is usually in the form of a solid 
sleeve. Again, the external diameter of the coupler needs to be 
accurate to ensure a good fit and reliable transfer of torque between 
the magnet and the shaft. This is a particular problem when the motor 
is designed or required to operate over a wide temperature range due to 
the differences in thermal expansion of the various parts. It is also known from GB - A - 2007146 to use a plastics hub to couple 
a ceramic ring-type magnet to a shaft of an electric induction motor. 
The hub is formed by injection moulding a structural foam plastics 
material which is caused to foam in the die during the injection 
moulding process to reduce the amount of bursting stress which would  
 
otherwise be imposed on the ring of magnetic material. A radially 
resilient tubular member may also be engaged within the bore of the 
ring of magnetic material to absorb radially outwardly directed forces. This problem is overcome in the present invention by providing a split 
flux ring having a nominal outside diameter greater than the inside 
diameter of the magnet and detent means between the flux ring and the 
coupler. In this manner, the flux ring is compressed to fit inside the 
magnet and due to its resilience provides a sprung interference fit 
able to tolerate reasonable variations in the inside diameter of the 
magnet while providing sufficient friction to reliably
