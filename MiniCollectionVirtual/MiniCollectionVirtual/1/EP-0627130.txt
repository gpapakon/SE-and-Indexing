<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a plug-in connector comprising a trough-shaped socket unit and a plug unit which fits into the socket unit, the ends of said connector each having safety ribs which together give the plug unit a width larger than the greatest internal diameter of the socket unit. This prevents the plug unit from being inserted crooked and hence damaging the pins located in the socket unit.

Plug connector, comprising a trough-shaped
receptacle part (20) and a plug part (1) which can be

inserted so as to fit into the latter, having the
following features:


the receptacle part (20) has a plug channel (27) which
has an elongate, approximately rectangular cross-section,

is bounded by longer longitudinal side walls
(23, 24) and shorter transverse side walls (25, 26) and

is closed off at its inner end by a bottom (21), from
which a multiplicity of plug pins (22) protrude at right

angles;
on account of recesses (33, 34) in the longitudinal
side walls (23, 24), the plug channel (27) of the

receptacle part (20) has an enlarged unobstructed width
approximately in the central region;
the plug part (1) has an essentially rectangular
cross-section having longitudinal side surfaces (3, 4)

and transverse side surfaces (5, 6) and having a front
closure surface (7), in which insertion openings (8) are

arranged for the passage of the plug pins (22) to plug
sockets lying behind it, the transverse side surfaces

(5, 6) being guided on the transverse side walls (25,
26) and the longitudinal side surfaces (3, 4) being

guided on guide sections (28, 20, 30, 31) of the
longitudinal side walls, during insertion of the plug

part (1) into the receptacle part (20), 
in the vicinity of the two end edges, safety ribs (35,
36, 37, 38) which extend in the insertion direction are

formed in each case on the two longitudinal side
surfaces (3, 4) of the plug part (1),
complementary safety grooves (45, 46, 47, 48) are
formed in each case in the longitudinal side walls of

the receptacle part (20), in the vicinity of the two end
edges, for receiving the safety ribs (35, 36, 37, 38),

the width of the plug part (1) having the respectively
opposite safety ribs (35, 36; 37, 38) being larger than

the maximum unobstructed width of the plug channel (27)
between the recesses (33, 34), the free ends (22') of

the plug pins (22) being situated at a specific safety
distance away from and underneath the closure edge (39)

of the side walls of the receptacle part (20), and the
safety ribs (35, 36, 37, 38) being set back from the

front closure surface (7) of the plug part by a distance
which is less than the safety distance between the plug

pins, and the corresponding safety grooves also having a
correspondingly adapted length.
Plug connector according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the safety ribs (35, 36, 37, 38)

of one side surface (3 or 4) are each at a different
distance away from the end edges of these side surfaces.
Plug connector according to either of Claims 1
and 2, characterized in that at least some of the safety

ribs (35, 36) are formed as projections on an encoding
rib (12).
Plug connector according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that at least some of the

safety ribs are formed on a closure plate (10) plugged
onto the plug part (1).
