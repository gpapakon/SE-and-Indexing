<ABSTRACT>
A hirudine variant having the sequence represented by the sequence identification number 1. A DNA coding for the amino 
acid sequence of the variant, an expression vector, a recombinant colon bacillus, and a process for producing the variant by using 

the bacillus. An anticoagulant containing the variant as the active ingredient. Because this variant is deficient in the sequence 
Asp³³-Gly³⁴- or Asp⁶²-Ala⁶³- contained in the amino acid sequences of the conventional hirudine and variants thereof, it 

can inhibit the formation of the succinimide derivative and β-transfer derivative otherwise caused by the above sequence and 
has a high stability and a high antithrombine activity, thus being useful as an anticoagulant. Furthermore, a hirudine variant having 

the sequence represented by the sequence identification number 1, wherein the sequence VAl¹-VAl²- contained in the amino 
acid sequence of the conventional hirudine variants has been replaced by the sequence Ile¹-Ile²-, has a significantly high antithrombin 

activity especially suitable for the use as an anticoagulant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns novel hirudin analogs, the 
amino acid sequences of which differ from those of natural 
hirudin analogs. The present invention also relates to the 
DNAs which provide the sequence code for the above-mentioned 
novel polypeptides. Furthermore, the present invention concerns vectors used to 
express the above-mentioned novel hirudin analogs, recombinant 
E. coli transformed by the expression vectors, and a method of 
producing the hirudin analogs through a secretion approach by 
amplifying transformed E. coli. Finally, the present invention concerns anticoagulants 
containing at least one novel hirudin analog with the 
above-mentioned novel amino acid sequence as their active 
ingredient. Hirudin is a polypeptide with anti-thrombotic activity which 
is isolated from the salivary glands of the medicinal leech, 
Hirudomedicinalis. Three hirudin analogs, HV1, HV2 and HV3 are 
known as natural hirudins. The amino acid sequence of these 
natural hirudins has been identified. The genes coding the 
identified amino acid sequence have been cloned as c-DNAs, and  
 
the DNA sequences have also been identified. Expression vectors were prepared using the c-DNAs cloned 
from natural genes. Expression of the polypeptides, the hirudin 
analogs, has been carried out by introducing the expression 
vectors into host microorganisms such as E. coli (Escherichia 
coli) and yeast (Saccharomycescerevisiae). Furthermore, based on knowledge related to the amino acid 
sequences of the natural hirudins, hirudin analogs with an 
artificial mutation of the amino acid sequence have been 
produced. The following are reported as examples. HV2(Lys⁴⁷) 
was made by introducing one amino acid substitution into the 
natural hirudin HV2. This hirudin analog exhibited an increased 
antithrombin activity as compared with that of the natural 
hirudin HV2, and exhibited a high antithrombin activity 
equivalent to that of the natural hirudin HV1. Other examples 
include an analog of the natural hirudin HV1 in which the amino 
acid sequence of the N-terminal region was substituted with other 
amino acids, and the HV1-like analog having extra amino acids 
attached to its N-terminal. An analog made by replacing the 
amino acid sequence of the N-terminal of natural hirudin HV1 from 
Val¹-Val²- to Ile¹-Ile²- was reported to exhibit a higher 
antithrombin activity than that of the natural hirudin HV1. The 
N-terminal region of a hirudin is thought to form an 
intermolecular bond with the enzyme active center or its
