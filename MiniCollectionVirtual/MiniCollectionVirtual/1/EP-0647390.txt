<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a construction for milking 
animals, such as cows, comprising a milking robot (8) for 

automatically connecting the teat cups (14; 15; 16; 17) to 
the teats of an animal. Near the upper end of a teat cup (14; 

15; 16; 17) a removable cover for at least this teat cup is 
disposed. When the relevant teat cup is inoperative, it is 

protected from contamination from the exterior, so that 
milking can be effected in very good hygienic circumstances.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a construction for milking
animals, such as cows, comprising a milking robot for
automatically connecting teat cups to the teats of an animal,
according to the preamble of Claim 1.Such constructions are known, see e.g. EP-A-0300582.In said constructions, the teat cups are usually
disposed on a robot arm. Prior to and after milking, the teat
cups are in a position next to the milking box. In this
stage, dirt can penetrate into the teat cups.The invention has for its object to provide a
construction of the above-described type, in which said
disadvantage does not occur or is at least obviated to a
significant extent.According to the invention, this is achieved in
that a cover which is movable over the upper end of the teat
cups is attached to the head of the milking robot. When the relevant teat
cup is not operative, it is protected from contamination, so
that milking can be effected in very hygienic circumstances.
In accordance with a further feature of the
invention, the milking robot head is provided with a covering
member which is slidable over the upper end of the teat cups.
Thus, immediately after the teat cups have been disconnected
from the teats, the teat cups can be covered with the aid of
a slidable covering member.So as to effect that the legs or other portions of
the animal are kept clean to an improved extent, the
construction in accordance with the invention includes a
movable collecting member for collecting the excrements of an
animal present in the construction, which member is disposed
at the trailing side of the construction. In accordance with
a still further feature of the invention, the collecting 
member is placed just above the floor of the construction. In
this manner, the rate of fall of the excrements can be kept
low.
In accordance with a still further feature of the invention the
construction includes a collecting member for collecting the
excrements of an animal present in the construction placed
just above the floor of the construction. In order to render
it easier for an animal to enter the milking box, the collecting
member is further characterized in that it is so connected
with the aid of a four-bar linkage that it can be
moved in the longitudinal direction of the construction, and
the entrance door of the construction is positioned in a
longitudinal side thereof. In accordance with a still further
feature of the invention, the bottom of the collecting member
extends rearwardly and obliquely downwards. Splashing of the
dung on hitting the bottom
