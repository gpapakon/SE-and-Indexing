<ABSTRACT>
Tiltable bracket for tilting devices, in particular driver's seats or the like under restricted spatial conditions with a support and a mechanism for pivoting the driver's seat with respect to the support, the support (3) and the driver's seat (7) being indirectly connected by means of a transmission which superimposes a lateral offsetting movement of the driver's seat (7) with respect to the support (3) on the tilting movement of the driver's seat (7).

<CLAIMS>
Tilting bracket for the tilting of 
devices, in particular driver's seats (7), or the 

like, in the case of restricted space conditions, 
having a support (3) and a mechanism for pivoting 

the driver's seat (7) with respect to the support 
(3), wherein the support (3) and the driver's seat 

(7) are in indirect connection 
via
 a mechanism, 
which superimposes on the tilting movement of the 

driver's seat (7) a lateral displacement movement 
of the latter with respect to the support (3), 

wherein the mechanism comprises a connection part 
(8) which is rotatably secured both on the support 

(3) and on the driver's seat (7), characterised in 
that the tilting and displacement movement of the 

driver's seat (7) with respect to the support (3) 
is performed 
via
 a link mechanism which is formed 
of a control cam (5) and a control pin (4) wherein 

the control cam (5) is formed in a plate, which 
extends downwards from a tilting plate (6). 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the lateral displacement 

movement is established in such a manner that an  
 

installation width (b) of the driver's seat is not 
exceeded at any time during the tilting movement. 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, characterised in that the mechanism 

comprises at least one connection part (8), in 
particular articulation levers (8). 
Tilting bracket according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the control cam (5) of the link mechanism comprises a 

control pin (4) located therein, wherein the control cam (5) is in connection 
with the driver's seat (7) and the control pins are in connection with the 

support (3). 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that the control cam (5) is 

preferably disposed perpendicular to the tilting 
bracket and comprises an arcuate slot, which 

establishes the superimposed displacement 
movement. 
Tilting bracket according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

control cam (5) is disposed on one side, on the 
side of the driver's seat (7) to which a handle 

(11) has been provided.  
 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that two articulation levers (8) 

are disposed on either side of the support (3), 
wherein an articulation lever cooperates with the 

control cam. 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that the articulation lever(s) 

(8) is/are pivotable at a first securing point 
(8a) about a shaft which is provided on the 

support side and at a second securing point about 
a shaft which is provided on the driver's seat 

(7). 
Tilting bracket according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that a tilting 

plate (6) is provided on the upper side of the 
support (3) which tilting plate bears the driver's 

seat (7) and in that the control cam (5) is 
disposed on the tilting plate (6), preferably 

perpendicular towards the bottom. 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that there is disposed, between 

the tilting plate (6) and the upper side of the 
support (3) a locking device for retaining the 

seat position of the driver's seat (7).  
 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that a locking hook (10) is 

formed as the locking device, which hook is 
located at the upper side of a bearing plate (9) 

at the upper end of the support (3). 
Tilting bracket according to Claim 10 or 
11, characterised in that the retainer of the 

locking device or locking hook (10) can be 
detached by moving the handle (11) which is 

disposed on the tilting plate (69). 
Tilting bracket according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

driver's seat (7) is accommodated in a 
displaceable manner on the tilting plate (6). 
Tilting bracket according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

driver's seat (7) comprises a back rest which is 
preferably hinged. 
Tilting bracket according to one of the 
preceding Claims, characterised in that the 

installation width of the driver's seat (7) is 
between 400 mm and 600 mm.  

 
Seat installed in a rigid manner, in 
particular a driver's seat, characterised in that 

it comprises one tilting bracket (1) according to 
one of the preceding Claims.
