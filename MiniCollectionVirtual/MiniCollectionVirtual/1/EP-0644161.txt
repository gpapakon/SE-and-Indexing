<ABSTRACT>
A mounting means for use in a glassware forming machine 
for moving an operative member, such as a funnel, baffle or 

blowhead, between an out of the way and operative positions. 
The machine comprises a vertical operating shaft and a 

parallel support shaft, and the mounting means comprises a 
first link adjustably mounted on the operating shaft and a 

second link slidably mounted on the support shaft. 
The two links are both pivoted to a head and form a parallel 

linkage with it. Means, for example a key and keyway, 
maintains the first link in a desired angular relationship 

with the operating shaft. The head is provided with a 
releasable device by which the operative member may be 

secured to the head in a desired angular relationship.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with mounting means for use
in a glassware manufacturing machine for an operative member
such as a funnel, a baffle or a blowhead.In a glassware manufacturing machine of the so-called
"individual section" type, it is necessary to move operative
members between out-of-the-way positions out of alignment
with an opening of a cavity of a mould of the machine and
operative positions in which the operative member is in
alignment with the opening of the cavity and in close
proximity thereto. For example, each section of the machine
comprises a blank mould in which parisons are formed from
gobs of molten glass, by either a pressing or a blowing
operation, and it is necessary to move a funnel into
alignment with the mould opening so that the funnel can
guide a gob into the mould cavity. The funnel is then moved
to an out-of-the-way position, to allow a baffle to close
the mould cavity opening, The baffle is moved in a similar
manner to the funnel in relation to the blank mould. A
blowhead, though which air is blown into a finishing mould
of the section and in which parisons transferred to the
finish mould from the blank mould are blown into articles of
glassware, is moved in a similar manner.Conventional moving means for moving the funnel baffle
and blowhead of a machine of the individual section type
operates in a similar manner in each case. The moving means
comprises a vertically disposed piston and cylinder assembly
having a piston with two integral piston rods. One piston
rod extends vertically-upwards providing a
vertically-extending shaft on which the mounting means for
the operative member is mounted for movement with the shaft. 
The other piston rod extends vertically downwards and
carries a cam follower which engages a cam track shaped so
that, during part of the movement of the piston along the
cylinder, it is caused to turn so that the first-mentioned
piston rod turns about a vertical longitudinal axis thereof.
The mounting means for the operative member comprises an arm
which extends horizontally and on which the operative member
is mounted and clamping means by which the mounting means is
clamped to the vertically-extending shaft so that the
mounting means moves with the shaft. The arrangement is,
thus, such that movement of the piston causes the
upwardly-extending piston rod to move vertically and to turn
about its longitudinal axis so that the operative member
makes a movement which has a rotary component about a
vertical axis and a linear component in a vertical
direct

<CLAIMS>
A mounting means for use in a glassware forming machine
for moving an operative member between an out of the way

position and an operative position in alignment with a mould
cavity opening of a mould of the machine, the machine

comprising a vertically extending operating shaft (6) which
is arranged to perform axial and rotary movements and a

parallel vertically extending support shaft (8), the
mounting means comprising a head (38) for supporting the

operative member; a first link (10,120) having a first end
portion (12,122) secured to the operating shaft (6) and a

second end portion (26) pivoted to the head; a second link
(46,156) having a first end portion (48,158) rotatably

mounted on the supporting shaft (8) and a second end portion
(52,162) pivoted to the head (38), the two links and the

head forming a parallel linkage characterised in that the
first link (10,120) is capable of adjustment up and down on

the operating shaft (6) and comprises means (18,21,131)
which co-operates with the shaft to maintain the link

(10,120) in a desired angular relationship to the shaft and
the operative member is supported on the head (38) by a

releasable device (84,92) which ensures that the operative
member is maintained in a desired angular relationship with

the head.
Mounting means according to claim 1 characterised in
that the first end portion (12,122) of the first link

(10,120) is clamped to the shaft by means of a bolt (16)
and an axially extending key and keyway (18,21,131) is

provided between the shaft and the first end portion to
maintain the shaft and the first link in the desired angular

relationship. 
Mounting means according to one of claims 1 and 2
characterised in that the first end portion (12) of the

first link (10) comprises a slot (24) which is arcuate about
the axis of the operating shaft, the support shaft (8)

extending through said slot.
Mounting means according to one of claims 1 and 2
characterised in that the first end portion (12) of the

first link (10) comprises two arcuate lugs (20,22) spaced
vertically apart, each lug comprising a slot (24) which is

arcuate about the axis of the operating shaft (6) the
support shaft (8) extending through the two slots and the

first end portion (48) of the second link (46) being mounted
on the support shaft between the two lugs.
Mounting means according to one of claims 1 and 2
characterised in that the first end portion (122) of the

first link (120) comprises a cutaway portion (132) and the first
end portion (158) of the second link (156) has a boss which

extends into the cutaway portion (132) and is supported by
closely fitting bearing blocks (136,138) in the cutaway

portion (132).
Mounting means according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that means (56 68) are provided to

provide for fine adjustment of the effective length of one
of the links (10,46).
Mounting means according to any of the preceding claims
characterised in that one of the pivots by which the head

(38) is supported on the two links (10,46) is an eccentric
pin (56).
Mounting means according to any one of the preceding
claims characterised in that the releasable device (84,92) 

is provided by a tongue and groove connection (70,80,86)
between the head (38) and the operative member which ensures

the head and the member are in a desired angular
relationship, and a readily releasable bolt (88) which

serves to clamp the operative member to the head.
