<ABSTRACT>
The invention specifies a system for avoiding erroneous coupling of supply hoses, connected to discharge stubs (6, 7, 14, 15, 16) on a tanker, of a stationary receiving tank, in the case of which system provision is made for control lines which are assigned to the supply hoses, and it is possible to activate the discharge stubs selectively by means of a selector switch (2). According to the invention, each discharge stub is assigned a switch (12, 13, 20, 21, 22) which, upon actuation of a valve (10, 11, 23, 24, 25) which is activated by the selector switch (2), switches over said discharge stub. The control lines of each supply hose connected to a discharge stub are each led to the switches assigned to the rest of the connection stubs and, from there, to the control unit, said control unit (1) emitting a switching signal to the selector switch (2) as soon as a switch, assigned to a discharge stub and via which the control signal is sent, carries out a switching-over operation.

System for connecting, in such a way that confusion 
between connections is impossible, one of a plurality of 

supply hoses, which are connected to discharge nozzles on a 
tanker vehicle and belong to a stationary reception tank, in 

particular a filling station, with control lines allocated to 
the supply hoses, wherein the at least two discharge nozzles 

of the tanker vehicle can be controlled selectively by means 
of a selector switch (2), characterised in that a switch 

(12, 13, 20-22) is respectively allocated to the discharge 
nozzles (6, 7, 14-16) and, upon actuation of a valve (10, 11, 

23-25) triggered by the selector switch (2), switches over 
this discharge nozzle, that the control lines of each supply 

hose connected to a discharge nozzle lead respectively to the 
switches allocated to the remaining discharge nozzles and 

from there to a control unit (1), and that the control unit 
(1) gives out a switching signal to the selector switch (2) 

as soon as a switch allocated to a discharge nozzle is 
switched over, by way of which switch the control signal is 

fed. 
System according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
control line allocated to a supply hose leads respectively by 

way of a series connection of the switches allocated to the 
discharge nozzles for the other supply hoses, and that 

interruption of the control line by opening a switch triggers 
the switching signal to switch over the selector switch (2).  

 
System according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
control line allocated to a supply hose leads to a parallel 

connection of the switches allocated to the discharge nozzles 
for the other supply hoses, and that switching on one of the 

switches triggers the switching signal to switch over the 
selector switch (2). 
System according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the switching signal of the control 

unit (1) triggers a pneumatic valve (4) to reverse the 
pneumatic selector switch (2). 
System according to claim 1 or 4, characterised in that 
the selector switch (2) is a pneumatic multi-way valve which 

gives out a respective switching signal to switch over one of 
the valves (10, 11, 23-25), allocated to the discharge 

nozzles, and an associated switch (12, 13, 20-22). 
System according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
switching pressures of the switches (12, 13, 20-22) allocated 

to the discharge nozzles are lower than the switching 
pressures of the valves (10, 11, 23-25) allocated to the 

discharge nozzles. 
System according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that 
the switching signal of the control unit (1) switches the 

selector switch (2) in a pressure free manner. 
System according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,  
 

characterised in that the control lines are electric lines 
and the switches are electric switches.
