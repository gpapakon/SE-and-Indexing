<ABSTRACT>
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus having a movement mechanism for a 
disc cartridge (220, 221) including a cartridge holder (3) for loading a disc 

cartridge (220, 221) containing a magneto-optical disc (200) or an optical disc (201) in 
a main body (1) of the apparatus. The apparatus includes a head device (13) for 

recording or reproducing information signals on or from the disc (200, 201), a 
movement mechanism (700) for moving the disc (200, 201) from a first position 

enabling recording and/or reproduction of information signals by the head device (13) 
and for moving the disc (200, 201) between the first position and a second position 

overlying the first position for performing the disc exchange operation. The apparatus 
also includes a lock unit (115) for locking the movement unit at the first position and a 

control mechanism (338) for moving the head device (13) between a position proximate 
to the disc (200, 201) and an upper position spaced apart from the disc (200, 201). The 

apparatus further includes an engagement mechanism (94) moved by the control 
mechanism (338) for being engaged with the lock unit (115). The engagement 

mechanism (94) is engaged by the control mechanism (338) with the lock unit (115) and 
is moved between a position disengaged from the lock unit (115) by an ejecting 

operation and a position of being released from the position of being disengaged from 
the lock unit (115). When the head device (13) is at an upper position spaced apart 

from the recording medium (200, 201), the engagement mechanism (94) is positioned at 
the position of being engaged with the lock unit (115) and releases the lock of the 

movement mechanism (700) by the lock unit (115) at the first position. When the head 
device (13) is proximate to the recording medium (200, 201), the engagement 

mechanism (94) is at a lock release position by the control mechanism (338). There is 
provided a first detection switch (160) for detecting that the movement 

mechanism (700) for the disc cartridge (200, 201) is at the first position of enabling 
recording and/or reproduction of information signals on or from the disc (200, 201). 

Unless the first detection switch (160) is actuated, recording or reproduction of 
information signals on or from the recording medium (200, 201) by the head device 

(13) is inhibited.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording and/or reproducing
apparatus employing a disc such as a magneto-optical disc or an
optical disc as a recording medium for information signals. More
particularly, it relates to a recording and/or reproducing
apparatus having a loading device for loading a disc cartridge
containing a magneto-optical disc or an optical disc as a
recording medium for information signals on a main body of the
apparatus.Up to now, a recording and/or reproducing apparatus
employing a recording medium such as a magneto-optical disc or
an optical disc for information signals has been proposed. The
magneto-optical disc or the optical disc, employed as a recording
medium for such recording and/or reproducing apparatus, is
contained in a main cartridge body to form a disc cartridge and
loaded in such state in the recording and/or reproducing
apparatus.The recording and/or reproducing apparatus has an optical
pickup and a magnetic head as means for writing and/or reading
information signals on or from the magnetic recording medium.
The optical pickup and the magnetic head are mounted on a chassis
provided in the main body of the apparatus to constitute a
recording and/or reproducing unit. On the other hand, the disc
cartridge having a disc cartridge containing the magneto-optical 
disc or the optical disc therein as a recording medium, is loaded
at a cartridge loading position in the recording and/or
reproducing apparatus so as to be positioned relative to the
recording and/or reproducing unit provided in the recording
and/or reproducing apparatus. By the disc cartridge thus being
loaded at the cartridge loading position, information signals are
recorded on the magneto-optical disc, with the aid of the optical
pickup and a magnetic head, or the information signals recorded
on the magneto-optical disc or the optical disc are reproduced.The recording and/or reproducing apparatus employing the
disc cartridge containing the magneto-optical disc or the optical
disc as a recording medium has a cartridge loading device for
loading the disc cartridge in a cartridge loading section within
the main body of the apparatus. The cartridge loading device has
a cartridge holder for holding the disc cartridge which is
movably mounted relative to the recording and/or reproducing unit
provided in the main body of the apparatus. The cartridge loading
device is operative to load the disc cartridge on the cartridge
loading section provided in the main body of the apparatus and
to load the magneto-optical disc or the
