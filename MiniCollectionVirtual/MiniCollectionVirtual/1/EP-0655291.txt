<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a high-speed flying shears, as set forth in
the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 and as known from FR-A-666.433.The invention concerns also a method employing this flying
shears to shear the leading and trailing ends of a rolled
bar, as set forth in the relative main claim.The flying shears according to the invention acts on
rolled stock, whether the rolled stock be a wire rod, or a
section to be supplied in bars leaving the last rolling mill
stand of a rolling train.The flying shears according to the invention is suitable
to shear rolled stock travelling at even more than 120
metres per second.It is known that the leading and trailing ends of the
rolled stock leaving the last rolling mill stand of a
rolling train include along their length geometric
deformations, non-homogeneous structures or unacceptable
inclusions and therefore have to be removed; this removal is
carried out generally in the line with a flying shears.The state of the art contains various disclosures of high-speed
flying shears for rolled stock.Embodiments which are substantially efficient but have
been found unsatisfactory for rolled stock travelling at
very high speeds are disclosed in FR-666.433, DE-804.056,
GB-2,075,899 and FR-1.578.587.To be more exact, these disclosed embodiments are not able
to meet the required accuracy of shearing nor the required
high speed.Moreover, these embodiments entail the problem of
discharging, shearing for scrap and recovering the end
segments sheared by the flying shears. Theses embodiments also involve the problems of energy
consumption and the obtaining of samples.FR-A-666.433, for instance, discloses a flying shears
governed by a rolling assembly that shears the rolled stock
to size with rotating blades. According to this document
the rolled stock is momentarily switched along a loop so
that the shearing can be performed. Even if the disclosed
drive and control system is used, the invention disclosed in
this document, owing to the formation of the loop, is only
suitable to process rolled stock travelling at medium
speeds. Moreover, no mention is made of the problem of
shearing for scrap the sheared leading and trailing end
segments or of obtaining sample segments.US-3,834,260, US-A-5,040,440 and DE-A-2.900.013 disclose a
flying shears employed to shear the leading and trailing
ends of bars leaving a rolling train but do not describe a
cycle to shear for scrap the leading and trailing end
segments of the bar nor a strictly and accurately guided
path of the bar downstream
