<ABSTRACT>
The device consists of a supporting structure (1) which forms a free space (2) which is to be enclosed, the upper opening (3) of which is enclosed by an outer grate-type supporting frame (4) and into which an inner grate-type supporting frame (15) is inserted once the supporting structure (1) has been firmly installed in a tree pit (5), the tree pit (5) filled with vegetable mould and the tree planted by way of its root ball (8). The supporting structure (1) supports the substantially horizontally running annular outer grate-type supporting frame (4), which is connected to downward-pointing bearing feet (9). The latter have foot rails (11) which are extended in central directions and on which the inner grate-type supporting frame (15) is borne via bearing rods (14).

An apparatus for the pressure-resistant covering of the ground in which a tree is 
rooted, having a supporting framework (1) with frame segments (22), which 

surrounds the tree (5) and which is provided with support legs (9) which run towards 
the ground supporting them, and the supporting framework (1) comprises an outer 

supporting grid frame (4) and an inner supporting grid frame (15) running 
concentrically therewith, wherein the support legs (9) are each provided with a foot 

rail (11) at their lower ends (10) remote from the outer supporting grid frame (4), 
which foot rails are each aligned towards a centre line of the supporting framework 

(1) and project beyond the outer supporting grid frame (4) at a distance from and in 
the direction of the centre line, wherein the foot rails (11) each comprise, at their 

inner ends (12) facing the centre line, a receiving device (13) for a lower end (26), 
which faces them, of a support rod (14) for the inner supporting grid frame (15), and 

wherein the lower end (26) of the support rod (14) and the receiving device (13) are 
matched to each other in the sense of a fixing and of the transmission of force into 

the respective foot rail (11). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer and the inner 
supporting grid frames (4, 15) consist of frame segments (22) which are of 

trapezoidal construction and which surround a tree (7) substantially annularly and 
concentrically in the region of its tree trunk (23). 
An apparatus according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the frame segments 
consist of angle sections. 
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that supporting grids (17, 
21) are disposed in the frame segments (22).  

 
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in that at least one grating 
(18) is placed on the supporting grids (17, 21). 
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the frame segments 
(22) of the inner supporting grid frame (15) comprise guide sleeves (25) which run 

parallel to the centre line and which are disposed on struts (31) which are aligned 
towards the centre line. 
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the guide sleeves (25) 
project beyond the struts (31) in the direction of the foot rails (11). 
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the support rods (14) 
are longitudinally displaceably mounted in the guide sleeves (25). 
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the support rods (14) 
have holes near their upper ends (27) facing the guide sleeves, wherein threaded 

bolts pass through the holes and fix the support rods (14) in the guide sleeves (25). 
An apparatus according to claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the support rods (14) 
extend between the inner supporting grid frame (15) and the receiving devices (13) 

of the foot rails (11) and are mounted on the inner supporting grid frame (15) 
supported on the foot rails (11).
