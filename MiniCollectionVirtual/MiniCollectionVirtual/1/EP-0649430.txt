<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with new antibiotics. In particular, this invention 
relates to compounds which are derivatives of the macrolide antibiotic 
repromicin; 
to the pharmaceutically-acceptable 
acid addition salts of such derivatives; to a method of using such derivatives in the 
treatment of illnesses in animals caused by bacterial and mycoplasmic pathogens; and 
to pharmaceutical compositions useful therefor. The term "animals" includes mammals, 
fish and birds. There are numerous agents known to combat bacterial infectious diseases in 
animals, but for many specific diseases the current agents of choice leave much to be 
desired. In some instances the agents may not persist long enough in the host and, 
therefore, require frequent dosing to maintain therapeutically effective blood and/or 
tissue levels. For meat producing animals (cattle, poultry, sheep and swine) this will 
require considerable labor intensive animal handling which is costly to the producer. 
In other cases, the agent may be poorly tolerated or even toxic to the host at 
therapeutically effective doses. Agents with increased potency, a longer half-life, an 
increased therapeutic index and a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity as well as 
agents with greater oral absorption would improve the scope of animal diseases that 
could be more effectively treated. Thus, the need for new antibacterial and anti-mycoplasmic 
agents with improved properties endures. Diseases of particular concem are: bovine respiratory disease, the principal 
causative bacterial pathogens of which are Pasteurella haemolytica,P. multocida and 
Haemophilussomnus; pasteurellosis in swine, goats, sheep and poultry (P. multocida); 
swine pleuropneumonia (Actinobacilluspleuropneumoniae); swine streptococcus 
infections (Streptococcussuis); and for all of the above mentioned hosts, infections by 
Mycoplasmaspp.Derivatives of tylosin and its related macrolides have been shown to be effective 
against infections in poultry, cattle and pigs caused by certain gram-positive and gram-negative 
bacteria: Kirst et at., U.S. Patent 4,920,103; Tao et at., U.S. Patent 4,921,947; 
Kirst et at., U.K. Patent Application GB 2135670A.  
 This invention is concemed with new antibiotics which are derivatives of the 
macrolide repromicin 
and to the 
acid addition salts of such derivatives. These new antibiotics have enhanced potency 
against bacterial pathogens over the parent compounds and are active against 
mycoplasmic pathogens. The compounds of the present invention
