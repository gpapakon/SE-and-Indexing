<ABSTRACT>
A method for driving in screws is proposed which is usable in an impact or impulse screwdriver. In this method, the prestressing force in the screw to be driven in is increased and evaluated stepwise as the screw is driven in. By measuring the prestressing force in the screw, there results the advantage that the friction at the screw head and the thread is eliminated and as a result a precise determination of the prestressing force of the screw is possible. The height of the steps of the prestressing-force increase may be used, as well as the number of impacts or impulses, as a criterion for the screwing quality or for controlling the screwing.

Method for tightening a screw, using a
hammer-action or impulse screwdriver which tightens the

screw step-by-step by individual torque impulses and at
the same time detects the prestress force (K) which

produces screw deformation in the screw, by measuring a
physical variable, characterized in that the number of

torque impulses (S
n
) in a screwdriving process is
counted, in that, after each torque impulse (S
n
), the
change in the prestress force (K
n
-K
n-1
) caused by the
torque impulse is determined, and in that, on reaching

a predetermined value for the change in the prestress
force (K), the screwdriving process is switched off

when a predetermined range has been reached for the
number of torque impulses (Sn).
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the prestress force (K) on the screw is detected

by means of a stress gauge or a piezo-sensor.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the prestress force (K) on the screw is detected

using an ultrasound delay time measurement method.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the number of torque

impulses (S
n
) which have been counted before the
hammer-action or impulse screwdriver is switched off as

well as the corresponding prestress forces (K) measured
before switching off are checked for plausibility. 
Hammer-action or impulse screwdriver for
carrying out the method according to one of the

preceding claims, having at least one measurement
sensor (5) for detecting the prestress force on the

screw, having a controller (3) with an input means for
inputting a switching-off value (E) corresponding to

the required prestress force, having calculation means
for determining their respective actual value based on

the values measured by the measurement sensor and for
respective comparison with the switching-off value (E)

in such a manner that the hammer-action or impulse
screwdriver can be switched off on reaching the

required prestress force, and having a data output,
characterized in that the hammer-action or impulse

screwdriver has a counter for counting the torque
impulses of a screwdriving process, in that the

controller is suitable for determining a respective
actual value which corresponds to the respective change

in the prestress force produced by one respective
torque impulse, and in that the controller switches off

the hammer-action or impulse screwdriver by evaluation
of the respective actual value as a function of the

input switching-off value (E) for the prestress force
and taking account of the number of torque impulses.
Hammer-action or impulse screwdriver according
to Claim 5, characterized in that the data output has

an indicator for an actual value of the prestress force
and/or the switching-off value.
Hammer-action or impulse screwdriver according
to Claim 5 or 6, characterized in that the data output

is designed to output a good screw connection (screw
connection satisfactory) or a poor screw connection

(screw connection not satisfactory).
