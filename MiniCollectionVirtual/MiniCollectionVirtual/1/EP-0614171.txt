<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a signal processing
device
according to the preamble of
claim 1.Recently, speech detection devices for detecting the
presence/absence of speech have been widely used for
applications such as speech recognition, speaker recognition,
equipment operation by speech, and input to computer by
speech.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a prior art speech
detection device, whose configuration and operation will be
explained hereinafter. A power detection section 19 detects
a power value in an input signal to render the value to be
compared by a comparator 21, and then the comparator 21
compares the value with a predetermined set value of a
threshold setting section 20 to output a speech-detected
signal when the value is larger than the predetermined set
value.According to the prior art speech detection device as
described above, however, even if a speech input is small ,
when the input signal contains a noise other than the speech, 
a power detected by the power detection section 19 larger
than the set value of the threshold setting section 20,
causes the voice-detected signal to be outputted, thereby
developing an inconvenience of frequent erroneous detections.The article "Auswertung von Echtzeit-Cepstra zur
schnellen Detektion stimmhafter Laute" of M. Timme, H. Idler
und T. Lay, Nachrichtentechnische Zeitschrift, 1973,
Vol. 7, pp. 112 and following teaches to use a cepstrum of
a speech signal for speech recognition.US 4 239 936 discloses a speech recognition system
adaptable to noisy environments. The system includes a recognition
unit for recognizing input speech signals and a
noise measuring unit for measuring the intensity of ambient
noises. The system also includes a rejection unit responsive
to a rejection standard controlled by the intensitiy of
the measured noise for rejecting the rejection results given
from the recognition unit when the rejection standard
is exceeded.It is the object of the present invention to provide
an improved method of recognizing speech signals.This object is solved in accordance with the features
of the independent claims. With the above claimed configuration,
a cepstrum calculation section through a peak
detection section detects a cepstrum peak of a speech input. 
Then, a speech detection section detects the presence/absence
of speech on the basis of the detected cepstrum
peak and supplies a first control signal corresponding to
the presence/absence of speech to a matching section.
Also, a control section, when a mode setting input is
