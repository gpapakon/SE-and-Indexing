<ABSTRACT>
The cap assembly (1) comprises: a cap (2) which 
when unscrewed causes a detachment or distancing 

of a safety strip (3) from the cap (2); and a 
convex seal (4) which, when the cap assembly is 

inserted on a bottle, is deformed by internal 
pressure in the bottle and guarantees a seal on an 

internal wall of a bottle neck (5), even when 
there are small axial movements of the cap 

assembly (1) with respect to the bottle neck (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cap for bottles 
containing gassed liquids. In particular, reference is made to caps made of 
plastic or other suitable material, wherein by 
unscrewing or lifting the cap a safety strip is 
detached or at least distanced. Caps of the above type not only present drawbacks 
connected to construction simplicity and fast 
screwing-on by automatic machines, but also pose a 
significant problem, common to all caps comprising 
safety strips, of safeguarding a consumer against 
illicit opening of the bottle. Several known caps offer quite satisfactory 
solutions to this problem, but it has been noted 
that often it is possible to unscrew a cap very 
slightly, not enough to break the safety strip 
(and thus prove that the bottle has indeed been 
opened) but, on the other hand, quite enough to 
break the original seal and allow gas, and even 
liquid, to escape from inside. What is more, and  
 
more serious, it would be possible to introduce 
fluids into the bottle in this way, and all 
without its being obvious thereafter to a 
consumer. Especially with plastic bottles, this 
risk is high, since pressing on the lateral wall 
of the bottle causes it to function like a suction 
pump; but the risk also exists with glass or other 
rigid bottles, which could be totally immersed in 
a bath of liquid to cause invasion of extraneous 
fluid. A principal aim of the present invention is to 
obviate the above-mentioned drawbacks, by 
providing a cap which allows no gas to escape from 
the bottle, nor any introduction of extraneous 
fluid therein bottle, unless the safety strip has 
already been removed. One advantage of the invention is that no extra 
cost is incurred by its use, nor is cap use 
consequently complicated. The above aims and advantages, and others besides 
are all attained by the invention, which like 
known cap assemblies comprises a cap which, when 
unscrewed, causes a safety strip to break or be 
distanced from the cap itself, and which exhibits 
an upper convex seal which, when the assembly is  
 
inserted on the bottle, is deformed by internal 
pressure in the bottle and guarantees a seal 
against an internal wall of a bottle neck, a seal 
which is guaranteed even when the assembly is 
slightly moved in an axial direction. Further characteristics and advantages of the 
present invention will better emerge from the 
detailed description that follows, of a preferred 
but non-exclusive embodiment here illustrated in 
the form of a non-limiting example in the 
accompanying
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cap assembly (1) for bottles containing gassed 
liquids, comprising a cap (2), applicable on a 

neck of a bottle, which when unscrewed or lifted 
in an axial direction causes a detachment or 

distancing of a safety strip (3), characterised in 
that it comprises a convex seal (4) made of a 

plastically deformable material connected to an 
internal upper part of the cap (2); a chamber (7) 

being afforded between an internal side of the 
convex seal (4) and said internal upper part of 

the cap (2); said convex seal (4) being deformed 
by a pressure within the bottle when inserted on 

the bottle neck; said convex seal (4) being able 
to assume a non-deformed conformation in which the 

convex seal (4) inserts into the bottle neck and a 
second conformation, in which the convex seal (4) 

is deformed by said pressure within the bottle and 
is forced against an internal 
wall of the bottle 
neck. 
A cap assembly, as in claim 1, characterised in 
 

that the convex seal (4) comprises: an annular 
zone (4a) which connects with an annular recess 

made in an internal upper part of the cap (2); a 
truncoconical zone (4b) having a larger base which 

coincides with an internal circumference of the 
annular zone (4a) and which minimum diameter is 

slightly smaller than an internal diameter of the 
bottle neck (5) and which height is greater than a 

minimum displacement distance of the cap (2) in 
order to break the safety strip (3); a dome-conformed 

zone (4c) connected to a lower base of 
the truncoconical zone (4b), having a straight 

section exhibiting an arc of length which is 
longer than the internal diameter of the bottle 

neck (5); a striker element, made on a concave 
internal wall of said dome-conformed zone (4c), 

which following a deformation of the convex seal 
(4) interferes with the cap (2) and limits a 

camber of a deformation of the convex seal (4). 
A cap assembly as in claim 2, characterised in 
that the striker element comprises a cross-rib (8) 

fashioned on the convex seal (4) coaxially to the 
dome-conformed zone (4c), said cross-rib (8) 

presenting arms which are shorter than a diameter 
 

of the lower base of the truncoconical zone (4b) 
and which height is equal to a difference between 

a maximum height of the chamber (7) and a maximum 
camber of the dome-conformed zone (4c) of the 

convex seal (4). 
A cap assembly as in claim 2, characterised in 
that a connection between the annular zone (4a) 

and the annular recess made in the upper internal 
part of the cap (2) is conformed such as to allow 

the convex seal (4) to rotate freely with respect 
to the cap (2).
