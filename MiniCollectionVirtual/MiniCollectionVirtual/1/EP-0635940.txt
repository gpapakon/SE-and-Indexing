<ABSTRACT>
An assertive latching flip-flop circuit is provided which 
prevents the occurrence of metastable outputs. The circuit 

comprises a single flip-flop which is comprised of standard 
switching transistors which are switched by a clocking 

mechanism having no additionally introduced delay. The circuit 
includes an imbalancing element which is coupled to a latching 

portion of the circuit. The latching portion of the circuit 
comprises a pair of cross-coupled transistors, in current mode 

embodiments of the invention, or a pair of cross-coupled 
inverters, in voltage mode embodiments of the invention. The 

imbalancing element introduces an electrical disturbance on the 
input line to one of the latching transistors or inverters. 

The imbalancing element is a capacitor in voltage mode 
embodiments of the invention and an additional transistor in 

current mode embodiments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to latching flip-flop 
circuits and more particularly to a flip-flop circuit having a 
mechanism for preventing the occurrence of a metastable output 
state. Bistable latches, such as flip-flops, are capable of assuming 
either of two stable binary output states. The state of the 
output depends on the states of a data input and a clock 
signal. Latching flip-flops used in asynchronous systems, 
wherein a clock signal and a data input signal are switched 
asynchronously, are typically subject to a third, or 
metastable, output state. A metastable output may occur if the 
data input signal is undergoing a transition in its logic state 
simultaneously with an active edge of the clock signal. In 
such a case, the output of the flip-flop may latch at an 
unstable or metastable state somewhere between a logical high 
state and a logical low state. Such an invalid logic level 
cannot be interpreted by subsequent logic stages receiving the 
output signal from the flip-flop, resulting in system errors. Typically, the metastable state will resolve itself over time 
as noise in the system stabilizes the output of the flip-flop 
by driving the output to either a high or low logical state. 
If noise does not resolve the metastability problem, however, 
the output of the flip-flop may be hung in an uncertain logical 
state until the next active clock cycle occurs. Often, the 
delay associated with either waiting for the output of the 
flip-flop to stabilize itself or waiting for the next active 
clock cycle is sufficiently long to cause subsequent logic 
circuitry to fail.  A known manner of correcting the metastability problem of 
flip-flops in asynchronous systems is to arrange two separate 
flip-flops in a cascaded configuration. U.S. Patent No. 
4,929,850 to Breuninger, for example, discloses two D-type 
flip-flops which are separately driven by clock pulses which 
are separated in time by a sufficient duration to nearly negate 
the possibility of the first latch being in its metastable 
state when the second latch is clocked. The output of the 
first flip-flop is permitted to stabilize before data is 
clocked into the second flip-flop. U.S. Patent No. 4,800,296 to Ovens, et al. discloses a 
metastable resistant flip-flop circuit including a single 
emitter transistor and a dual emitter transistor. During a 
metastable condition, each of the transistors conducts current. 
The second emitter on the dual emitter transistor, however, 
conducts additional current after a delay
