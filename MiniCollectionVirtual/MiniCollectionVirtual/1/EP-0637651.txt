<ABSTRACT>
The sanitary appliance comprises, integral therewith and 
projecting lowerly from its lower outer surface, a profiled wall 

(10) arranged to define a cavity (11) which encloses the water 
stream emerging both from the discharge port (3) and from the 

overflow aperture (7), and having a lower edge (12) defining the 
open lower end of the cavity (11); to the wall (10) there is 

joined a profiled cup (30) which is shaped to define a trap 
passage, has an open upper end into which the inlet of the trap 

passage opens and of which the edge (32) is arranged to sealedly 
mate with the lower edge (12) of the profiled wall (10), and has 

an outlet port (33) communicating with the final end of the trap 
passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sanitary appliances of sink, wash basin, 
bidet and similar type, ie appliances comprising at least one 
water-containing bowl with a discharge port in its base and 
overflow apertures in its side. In the known art, relatively complex means and operations are 
required to connect said discharge port and overflow apertures to 
the waste pipe. Usually the discharge port and the overflow each require an 
appropriate coupling which is connected to the lower outer surface 
of the appliance, and a common manifold which is then connected to 
a trap element, itself connected to the waste pipe. The various connection operations are relatively complicated and 
require specialized labour and relatively lengthy assembly/removal 
times. These means and operations are further complicated if other 
discharge pipes are to be connected to said manifold, for example 
the discharge from a washing machine or from a dishwasher. A further drawback derives from the fact that the joints between 
the various elements of the discharge-trap assembly and between 
this and the sanitary appliance are often a cause of water leakage 
because of their relative complication.  
 In particular it is frequently difficult and complicated to 
connect the couplings to the bowl at the overflow apertures. The object of the present invention is to obviate the aforesaid 
drawbacks. Said object is attained according to the invention both by 
modifying the lower outer surface of the sanitary appliance and by 
a special profiled cup applied to the sanitary appliance. In FR-A-1017211 a sanitary appliance is disclosed having the features of the preamble of claim 1. This appliance comprises a profiled 
wall projecting downwardly from the outer lower surface of the 
appliance to define, together with a profiled cup, a cavity 
enclosing in use the two streams leaving the discharge part on 
the overflow aperture respectively. is shaped in such a way that the two streams deriving from the 
discharge part and the out-flow respectively are gathered 
together and then discharger through a circular aperture coupled 
to a trap. The bowl has a relatively complex shape, which makes 
the building of the bowl itself relatively very complex and costly. According to the invention the sanitary appliance comprises the features of claim 1. The appliance comprises a 
profiled wall projecting lowerly from the lower surface of the 
appliance and integral therewith, to define, together with the 
lower surface of the appliance, a cavity enclosing
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A unit with a sanitary appliance of sink, wash basin, bidet or similar 
type and relative discharge means, said appliance containing at least one 

water-containing bowl (2) with a discharge port (3) and an overflow 
aperture (7) laterally apart placed with respect to the discharge port (3), 

comprising: 

a profiled wall (10) projecting downwardly, in a substantially straight 
direction, from the outer lower surface of the appliance (1) and having a lower edge (12) of elongate closed ring form and sides rising from the lower edge (12) which are vertical when the unit is in use to define 

together with said outer lower surface , a cavity (11) enclosing in use the 
tvo water streams leaving the discharge port (3) and the overflow 

aperture (7), respectively, 
a profiled cup (30) which is associated with the profiled wall (10) and 
shaped to define a trap passage, which cup has an open upper end into 

which the inlet of the trap passage opens, and has an outlet port (33) 

communicating with the final end of the trap passage, 
 
characterised by that: 


said profiled wall (10) is integral with the lower part of the appliance and 
has a lower edge (12) defining the open lower end of the cavity (11); 
the profiled cup (30) is connectable and disconnectable from the profiled 
wall (10) and has an edge (32) arranged to sealedly mate with the lower 

edge (12) of the profiled wall (10), 
the lower edge (12) of the profiled wall(10) and the edge (32) of the profiled 
cup (30) having an identical profile in plan and mutually engaging in a 

sealed manner when the profiled wall (10) and the profiled cup (30) are 
brought together. 
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
profiled cup (30) comprises: 


a container body (38) the upper end of which defines said upper 
end of the cup and having a first portion closed lowerly by a cup-shaped 

lower wall (381) and a second portion positioned to the 
side of the first portion to define said outlet port (33); 
a baffle (39) of inclined profile joined to two opposing sides and 
to the downstream region of the container body (38), to terminate 

within the first portion below the level of the water contained in 
said cup-shaped lower part (381). 
A unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said 
profiled cup (30) has at least one lateral inlet port (41) 

communicating with the inlet of the trap passage. 
A unit as claimed in claim 3, characterised in that said 
profiled cup (30) has at least one deviator baffle (42) positioned 

facing the lateral inlet port (41) at a short distance therefrom. 
A unit as claimed in claim 1, in which the sanitary 
appliance (1) comprises two bowls (2) with two relatively close 

opposing lateral walls (6), said overflow apertures (7) 
communicating with the space defined between said lateral walls 

(6), each bowl (2) having respective discharge ports (3), 
characterised in that said profiled wall (10) comprises a lower 

portion (103) of closed ring form surrounding the two discharge 
ports (3) and from which there extend two mutually parallel 

upwardly elongate upper portions (104), each of which joins a 
lateral wall (6) of one bowl (2) to the opposing lateral wall (6) 

of the other bowl (2), to define a sort of vertical duct for the 
water leaving from the overflow (7). 
A unit as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that 
said profiled cup (30) is shaped to define two trap passages, each 

having its inlet positioned in correspondence with a respective 
discharge port (3) and its final end connected to a common outlet 

port (33).
