<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the alternative production of a hot-rolled strip (24), a hot-deformed, pre-strip (14) or a non-deformed slab made of steel by means of continuous casting, to achieve a high product quality for the thinnest possible strips and to achieve a high degree of operating flexibility, the following features are realised individually or in combination:   - casting of a strand (4) of slab thickness (2) in an open-ended mould (1) having a constant cross-section throughout, - a first deformation step, comprising deformation of the strand (4) having a liquid core to reduce its thickness (2), - a second deformation step, comprising deformation of the strand (4) which has already completely solidified for further thickness reduction of the same to a pre-strip size (12), and - a third deformation step, comprising deformation of strand pieces (14) cut off from the strand (4) and preferably having a pre-strip size (12), by hot-rolling the strand pieces (14).

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a plant

comprising an open-ended mold (1) having a continuously constant cross section of a slab,
a first forming stage (5 to 9) provided in the region below the mold, in which the strand (4)
has a liquid core,
a second forming stage (10) provided in the region in which the strand (4) has already
completely solidified,
a third forming stage (17) constituted by a one- or multi-stand hot-rolling stand (19), and
a separating means (13) provided between the second and third forming stages for producing
strand pieces (14) separated from the strand (4),

characterized in that
for alternatively producing a hot-rolled strip (24) of steel or a hot-formed pre-strip (14) of
steel or an unformed slab of steel, different forming stages are activated or deactivated,

respectively,
for producing a strip (24) as thin as possible, all of the forming stages are activated in sum,
for producing a strip (14) having a slightly larger thickness, only the second and third
forming stages are activated individually or in sum, and
for producing an unformed slab, all of the three forming stages are deactivated.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that, for producing a strip (24), the
first and second forming stages are activated individually or jointly as a function of the steel

grade and under consideration of the forming properties of the latter at the temperature
conditions prevailing during these forming stages.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that only the second and third
forming stages are activated for high-alloy or high-carbon structural steels, for high-strength

tube steels, for austenitic steels and for duplex steels.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that forming in said first forming
stage is carried out in a manner known per se immediately upon emergence of the strand (4)

from the mold (1).
A method according to claim 4, characterized in that forming in said first forming
stage is carried out in a plurality of partial steps in a manner known per se. 
A method according to one or several of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that said
second forming stage is preceded by descaling in 
a manner known per se.
A method according to one or several of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that
temperature homogenization of the separated strand pieces (14) is effected before said third

forming stage.
A method according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that a reduction
of the thickness of the strand (4) down to a minimum thickness of 30 mm is effected by the

first two method stages applied individually or jointly.
