<ABSTRACT>
The line protection circuit breaker contains a magnetic short-circuit current release and a thermal overcurrent release having a bimetallic strip (10). In the case of this line protection circuit breaker, the line current is carried in a current path which, in addition to two contacts (44, 48) (which can move relative to one another) and a section of the bimetallic strip (10), also has an electromagnetic coil (22) and a section of a yoke (which contains a ferromagnetic material) of the short-circuit current release. The magnetic field which is produced by the coil (22) in the event of a short-circuit current is used to attract the armature (24) of the short-circuit current release and for magnetic blowing of a switching arc which is formed while the contacts (44, 48) are opening. The live yoke section (18) is formed from a non-ferromagnetic metallic material whose mechanical strength is comparable to the ferromagnetic material of the yoke but has a much higher electrical conductivity than this material. The line protection circuit breaker is distinguished by a very high rated current capacity with a compact construction.

Circuit breaker having a magnetic short-circuit 
current release and having an overcurrent release which 

contains a bimetallic strip (10), in the case of which 
the line current is carried in a current path which, in 

addition to two contacts (44, 48) which can move relative 
to one another as well as a section of the bimetallic 

strip (10), also has an electromagnetic coil (22) and a 
section of a yoke of the short-circuit current release, 

in which the yoke contains a magnet bow (16), which is 
bent in the U-shape and is made of ferromagnetic 

material, and a yoke plate (18), which is connected to 
said magnet bow at the end, forms the current-carrying 

yoke section and fixes the bimetallic strip (10), and in 
which circuit breaker the magnetic field which is produced 

by the coil (22) in the event of a short-circuit 
current is used to attract an armature (24) of the short-circuit 

current release and for magnetic blowing of a 
switching arc which is formed when the contacts (44, 48) 

open, characterized in that the yoke plate (18) is formed 
from a non-ferromagnetic metallic material whose mechanical 

strength is comparable with that of the ferromagnetic 
material of the magnet bow (16) but whose electrical 

conductivity is a plurality of times greater than that of 
this material, and in that the yoke is open because of 

the yoke plate (18), which is formed from non-ferromagnetic 
material. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the non-ferromagnetic material is an 

alloy based on copper, silver and/or aluminium. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the non-ferromagnetic alloy contains 

predominantly copper or at least iron or tin. 
Circuit breaker according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that a flexible electrical link, 

which is configured as a first double braid (12), is 
arranged in the current path between the bimetallic 

element (10) and a first (14) of two electrical connections  
 

(14, 72). 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the first double braid (12) is mounted on 

the bimetallic strip (10) in an electrically conductive 
manner such that the section of the bimetallic strip (10) 

through which the line current flows is considerably 
shorter than the length of the bimetallic strip 10 which 

is required for overcurrent tripping. 
Circuit breaker according to one of Claims 4 or 
5, characterized in that a flexible electrical link, 

which is configured as a second double braid (74), is 
arranged in the current path between a second (72) of two 

electrical connections (14, 72) and a moving contact (48) 
of the two contacts (44, 48). 
Circuit breaker according to one of Claims 4 to 
6, characterized in that the first electrical connection 

(14) and/or the second electrical connection (72) contain/contains 
no brass and are/is made predominantly of 

copper. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that at least one of the two contacts (44, 48) 

has an insert which contains noble metal. 
Circuit breaker according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the insert is formed from an alloy which 

contains silver and nickel.
