<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 
for forming color toner images on an electrophotographic 

photosensitive member (4a) and for transferring 
the color toner images onto a transfer member (2), in 

which the vibration is prevented from acting on the 
photosensitive member (4a) during a latent image 

corresponding to each color image is formed, thereby 
improving the image quality. That is to say, when a 

peripheral length of the transfer member (2) is L₁, a 
distance between a light illuminating position (21) of 

the light information illuminating means on the 
photosensitive member (4a) and a transfer position (22) of the 

transfer member is L₂, and a length of a maximum 
image formed on the transfer member (2) is L₃, a relation 

(L₁-L₃) 
>
 L₂ is established, thereby preventing the 
vibration from developing device switching 

from acting on the photosensitive member (4a).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color 
image forming apparatus of electrophotographic type 
such as a color copying machine, a color printer and 
the like. In some color image forming apparatuses, 
latent images corresponding to various color components 
are formed on an iamge bearing member and such 
latent images are developed by developer having 
colors corresponding to the latent images to obtain 
color toner images. Whenever each toner image is 
obtained, the toner image is transferred onto a 
transfer material held by a rotating transfer drum. 
By repeating such transferring operations by several 
times corresponding to the number of color toner 
images, a multi-color image is obtained. In this 
case, as shown in Fig. 5, by firmly assembling an 
electrophotographic photosensitive drum (image 
bearing member) 4a to a body 9 of the image forming 
apparatus with high accuracy, disarrangement or 
vibration of rotation of the photosensitive drum 4a 
is prevented, thereby obtaining the color image with  
 
higher quality. Further, since the photosensitive durm 4a 
must have a relatively large diameter (at least a 
half of a diameter of a transfer drum 3) in order to 
improve the durability of the photosensitive drum 
4a, the diameter of the photosensitive drum 4a was 
50 mm or more. However, in the conventional combination of 
the photosensitive drum 4a and the transfer drum 3, 
regarding a plurality of developing devices 5 (i.e., 
magenta developing device 5M, cyan developing 
device 5C, yellow developing device 5Y and black 
developing device 5K), after development for a 
certain color was finished, a mechanical switching 
operation for bringing the next developing device to 
the photosensitive drum 4a to perform development 
for a next color was effected before the previous 
transferring operation is completely finished. That 
is to say, it was designed so that a distance (X₁) 
between a latent image forming position (where image 
information light λ is incident to a surface of the 
photosensitive drum 4a) and a transfer position 
(where the photosensitive drum 4a is opposed to the 
transfer drum 3) becomes greater than a value 
obtained by subtracting a length (X₃) of the 
transfer material 2 wound around the transfer drum 3 
from a peripheral length (X₂) of the transfer drum 3,  
 
that is, (X₂ - X₃) < X₁. With this arrangement, 
unless the previous developing device is changed or 
switched to the next developing device during the 
transferring operation, the next latent image 
formation cannot
