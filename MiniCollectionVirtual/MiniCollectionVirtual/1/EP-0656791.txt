<ABSTRACT>
Therapeutic physiologically acceptable mixtures comprising PQQ and a reducing agent or agents characterized by a net reducing capacity greater than the oxidizing capacity of PQQ originally in the mixture. The reducing agent(s) is present in substantial molar excess of the PQQ. Kits for forming such mixtures are also disclosed comprising a supply of PQQ stably maintained in reduced form, and a supply of the reducing agent(s), separately packaged from the supply of PQQ. The preferred reducing agent is ascorbate. Other reducing agents include anionic -ene diols, thiols, sulfhydryl-containing amino acids. Specific reducing agents include TironR, mercaptosuccinate, D-penicillamine, glycine and dopamine. Also disclosed are methods for treating a PQQ-responsive condition in a mammalian patient, comprising administering to the mammal a composition comprising PQQ and the reducing agent(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions and
therapeutic methods involving 2,7,9,-tricarboxy-pyrroloquinoline
(which we will refer to as "PQQ" for
convenience, and which is sometimes also known as
methoxatin) and related compounds including redox forms
of PQQ.PQQ was isolated in 1979 from methylotrophic
bacteria. The structure of a crystalline acetone adduct
of PQQ was elucidated by X-ray diffraction (Salisbury et
al., 1979, Nature 280:843-844), and the organic synthesis
of methoxatin has been described (Corey and Tramontano,
1981, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103:5599-5600; Gainor and
Weinreb, 1982, J. Org. Chem. 46:4317-4319; Hendrickson
and deVries, 1982, J. Org. Chem. 47:1148-1150; Gainor and
Weinreb, 1982, J. Org. Chem. 47:2833-2837; Buchi et al.,
1985, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 107:5555-5556). The entire
carbon and nitrogen skeleton of tyrosine (a metabolic
precursor of PQQ) is incorporated into PQQ, probably
through a dopaquinone intermediate (van Kleef and Duine,
1988, FEBS Lett. 237:91-97), and the remainder of PQQ is
most likely derived from glutamic acid (Houck et al.,
1988, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110:6920-6921).PQQ is the redox factor in several bacterial
enzymes (oxidases) from which it can be removed by
dialysis. It is reported to be covalently bound to some
mammalian enzymes in which case the complex has been 
designated as a quinoprotein (Duine and Jongejan, 1989,
Ann. Rev. Biochem. 58:403-426), a term that describes
enzymes purported to contain covalently bound PQQ.
However, several investigations do not confirm the
occurrence of covalently bound PQQ in mammalian enzymes
(Gallop et al. (1990) Chemtracts-- Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology1: 357-374; Robertson et al., 1989, J.
Biol. Chem. 264:19916-19921; Paz et al., 1991, J, Biol.
Chem. 266:689-692; Veldink et al., 1990, FEBS Lett.
270:135-138; Michaud-Soret et al., 1990, Biochem.
Biophys. Res. Comm. 172:1122-1128; Kumazawa et al., 1990,
Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 283:533-536; Klinman et al.,
1991, FEBS Lett. 282:1-4). Recent work has led to the
identification of the posttranslationally derived redox-cofactor,
6-hydroxydopa quinone, in bovine plasma amine
oxidase (Janes et al., 1990, Science 248:981-987), and of
another type of covalently bound posttranslationally
derived quinone in the bacterial methylamine
dehydrogenase (McIntire et al., 1991, Science 252:817-824).In another study, when mice were fed a chemically
defined diet devoid of PQQ, they grew poorly, failed to
reproduce and became osteoarthritic (Killgore et al.,
1989, Science 245:850-851). The presence
