<ABSTRACT>
The preparation of thermoplastic polymers of 
vinyl and ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid 

anhydride monomers, of compositions containing these 
polymers, especially blends thereof with other 

thermoplastic or elastomeric polymers, and of shaped 
articles obtained from these compositions and blends is 

described. The process for preparing a thermoplastic 
polymer comprising at least one vinyl monomer includes 

heating a polymer based on at least one vinyl monomer, at 
least one ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid 

anhydride, and, optionally, a copolymerisable derivative 
of said anhydride chosen from the free dicarboxylic acid, 

esters or imides thereof, at a temperature which is 
sufficient to promote evolution of carbon dioxide while in 

the presence of a basic salt of a metal. The blends of the 
polymers obtained by this process with further 

thermoplastic and/or rubbery polymers find application in 
the construction of moulded articles for the automotive 

industry, for electric and electronic devices and 
household articles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation 
of thermoplastic polymers of vinyl and ethylenically 
unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride monomers, to 
compositions containing these polymers, especially blends 
thereof with other thermoplastic or elastomeric polymers, 
and to shaped articles obtained from these compositions 
and blends. Thermoplastic polymers which comprise moieties 
derived from a vinyl monomer and an ethylenically 
unsaturated dicarboxylic acid anhydride are known. 
Special interest has been focused on such polymers, 
wherein the vinyl monomer is a vinyl aromatic monomer, 
such as styrene, and the dicarboxylic acid anhydride is 
maleic anhydride (SMA copolymers). They are described in, 
e.g., EP-A-0183313. The high molecular weight SMA 
copolymers are of interest in the automotive industry and 
in the fabrication of domestic articles. These copolymers 
are usually prepared by mass polymerisation or solution 
polymerisation. According to US-A-2971939 it is possible 
to obtain SMA by reacting styrene with maleic anhydride in 
the presence of a peroxide. The reaction can be better 
controlled if a solvent is used, for instance, methyl 
ethyl ketone, acetone, xylene, dioxane, ethylbenzene, 
dimethylformamide or toluene. In a standard process, the maximum amount of 
maleic anhydride (MA) that can be incorporated into high 
molecular weight SMA is 50 mol.-% (alternating copolymer), 
since maleic anhydride does not homopolymerise under the 
standard reaction conditions. Copolymers with lower MA  
 
content can be obtained if in a continuous polymerisation 
process a mixture containing much styrene and little MA is 
introduced into a polymerisation vessel at high 
temperature during firm stirring and, at the same time, 
the same amount of polymerisation mixture is removed from 
the vessel (cf. A.W. Hanson, R.L. Zimmermann, Industrial & 
Engineering Chemistry, 1957, 49, No. 11, pp. 1803-1807). It is known to modify the SMA copolymers 
obtained in this way by hydrolysis, esterification with an 
alcohol or imidification with a primary amine to partially 
or completely transform the anhydride groups into the 
corresponding free diacid, ester or imide. Several blends of SMA or its derivatives with 
other thermoplastic polymers, such as SAN, and/or with 
rubbers, including ABS, have also been described (cf. DE-A-3332326). As thermoplastic polymers, the SMA copolymers 
and their derivatives are normally processed in extrusion 
and injection moulding processes. Due to their high 
softening
