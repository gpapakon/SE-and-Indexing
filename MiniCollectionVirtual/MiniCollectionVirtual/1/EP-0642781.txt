<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new oil-in-water type emulsions which are both stable and of pH less than or equal to 3.5, in particular of pH less than or equal to 3, the said emulsions comprising, as stabilising agent, a cross-linked anionic copolymer which is substantially soluble in water and consisting of units derived from the reaction between (i) acrylamide, (ii) 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulphonic acid and (iii) at least one compound with an olefin polyunsaturation (cross-linking agent), the said compound with an olefin polyunsaturation being present in the copolymer at a concentration of between 0.06 and 1 millimole per mole of the monomer units as a whole. It also relates to cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical compositions comprising such emulsions.
