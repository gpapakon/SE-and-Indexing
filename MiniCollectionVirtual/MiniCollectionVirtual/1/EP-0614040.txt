<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reticular structure, 
namely a sectional network structure of a type specially 
designed to be light, easily and rapidly assembled, 
flexible in its application and functional in its adaptability 
to a variety of requirements. These and other 
objects and advantages will be made clear by the following 
text. Substantially, the structure in question comprises, 
in combination, lattice elements with successive sides 
inclined in opposite directions; longitudinal connecting 
pieces and partial longitudinal terminal connecting 
pieces for the joining of successive lattice elements in 
alignment with each other; links for snap connection 
between longitudinal connecting pieces of adjacent 
lattice elements which have been brought together; 
components for mechanical connection and alternatively 
components for mechanical and electrical connection 
between successive lattice elements; adaptors which may 
be fitted to said longitudinal connecting pieces for 
lighting or consumer units to be combined with the 
reticular structure. The connecting links are electrically insulating; at 
least some of the connecting components are components 
for mechanical and electrical connection, so that the 
successive lattice elements of a line form a low-voltage 
current conductor to be combined with another conductor 
formed by a contiguous line of successive butted lattice 
elements, for the supply of the lighting units. To 
achieve this, the adaptors have current take-off type 
clamps, for the supply of the corresponding lighting or 
consumer units. Jaw-type clamps which can be locked onto the lattice 
elements, for the electrical power supply or for transverse 
electrical connections, may be fixed to the structure.  The components for mechanical connection may comprise 
a body and a plate used as terminals for terminal 
cross-pieces for transverse connection between the ends 
of upper and lower sections of the adjacent lattice 
elements; said body and said plate being joinable by, in 
particular, a snap fit. One body and one plate may form 
a trim terminal when fitted to the abutting ends of contiguous 
lattice elements, said components having nut and 
bolt means passing through them for a mechanical joint. The components for mechanical and electrical connection 
may comprise a U section capable of containing the 
adjoining terminal cross-pieces of successive lattice 
elements, and a plate which can be tightened with a screw 
against said section. Other details are specified in dependent claims
