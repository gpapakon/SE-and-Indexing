<ABSTRACT>
System for joining a component (1) in the form of a sheet to a rigid component (2) mechanically fastened to the sheet in a substantially planar contact region (4'), characterised in that the sheet around the contact region has a plurality of concentric circular undulations (crinkles) (10, 11). The invention applies to any device including a mechanical connection between a rigid component and a component in sheet form, particularly in the form of a metal sheet.

<CLAIMS>
Assembly of a sheet-metal component (1) and of a
rigid component (2) mechanically fixed to the metal sheet

at a substantially plane area of contact (4'), characterized
in that the metal sheet includes, around the contact

area, several concentric circular corrugations (10,
11).
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the metal sheet includes several concentric corrugations

(10, 11) of amplitude decreasing towards the
periphery.
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the metal sheet is fixed to the rigid component by

a fixing means (3) which passes through a hole (13) in
the metal sheet.
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the metal sheet includes, around the hole (13), a

raised flange (12).
Assembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a washer (8) is interposed

between the metal sheet and the rigid component.
Assembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the corrugations are

produced on the metal sheet, before assembly, by stamping.
Assembly according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the metal sheet is made of

steel.
