<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for detecting the operational state of an ink ribbon in a printer, in particular in a printer in a travel agency. The said ink ribbon is conveyed via an electric rotary actuator motor which is connected to the drive shaft of an ink ribbon cartridge, the magnitude of the transmitting drive force being inferred from the current taken up by the rotary actuator motor. According to the invention it is proposed that predetermined threshold values of the current characteristic (12) are detected during a measuring period (11) in which the rotary actuator motor (4) is operated in a pulsed manner, that, during this process, the value of the motor current pulse is compared with the threshold value in an evaluation unit (7), and that whenever the threshold value is exceeded a change in level takes place at the output of the evaluation unit (7) so that the resulting clock sequence is counted in a microprocessor (8) and used for the measurement result and for a display which is dependent thereon.

Procedure for the recognition of the condition of functioning of an ink-ribbon in
a printer, especially in a ticket-printer, whereby the ink-ribbon is transported by

an electrical motor which is connected to the axis of revolution of the ribbon
cartridge, and whereby the electrical current consumption of the electrical

motor is equivalent with the amount of the propulsive power,
characterised by a measuring duration (11) during which the electrical motor

(4) is driven by signal pulses, and a defined treshold value is detected, that
during this phase the signal pulses of the current value is compared with the

treshold value in a system evaluator (7) and that by exceeding the treshold
value the electronic level is changed at the exit of the system evaluator (7), so

that the arising clock pulse rate is counted in a microprozessor (8) and the
measuring result is measured in dependance of a defined number of clock

pulses and is measured for a dependant indicating device.
Procedure according to claim 1, wherein the treshold value is defined in such
a manner, that the treshold value is reached only during starting the run of the

electrical motor or by blocking the electrical motor.
Procedure according one of the claims 1 or 2, wherein the measuring is
caused by switching on the printer and / or by closing the printer-housing.
Procedure according one of the claims 1 to 3, wherein the measuring duration
(11), the pulse frequency and the pulse duty factor are tuned to the electrical

motor (4). 
Procedure according one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the period length of the
cycles during switching on the electrical motor (4) and the pulse duty factor of

the electrical motor (4) are brought to an optimum value in such a manner that
the electrical motor (4) is reaching a minimum number of revolutions before it

is powered again.
Procedure according claim 1, wherein based on a lower number of clocks the
ink-ribbon (1) is missing, is teared or is totally blocked and wherein based on

a higher number of clocks the ink-ribbon (1) is present and is mechanically
working.
Device for the recognition of the condition of functioning of an ink-ribbon in a

printer, especially in a ticket-printer, whereby the ink-ribbon is conducted
endless in an ink-ribbon cartridge and the ink-ribbon cartridge has an axis of

revolution which is connected to the electrical motor (4), whereby the electrical
motor (4) is driven under pulse conditions and is connected to a system

evaluator (7) and the generated clock pulse rate or impulse rate of the system
evaluator (7) is given to a microprocessor (8) whereby the microprocessor (8)

is connected with the motor driver circuit (9) and the motor driver pulses (10)
are gated as ON- / OFF - signals to the electrical motor (4), characterised that

the system evaluator (7) on the base of former defined treshold value pulses
the recognition of the condition of functioning of the ink-ribbon is measured by

counting the clock pulse rate in the microprocessor (8).
