<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
deflector for performing optical control using a 
mechanically movable portion, a method of manufacturing 
the same, and an image display device using this 
optical deflector. Most of the existing optical deflectors use, for 
example, a mechanical stop used for-light amount 
control in a camera or the like, a solid-state optical 
shutter (Electrophotography, Vol. 30, No. 4, 1991, 
pp. 447-494) for controlling, within a small area, the 
amount of light radiated from a rear surface using an 
electrooptical effect of a liquid crystal cell or 
ferroelectric material (e.g., a PLZT), and the like. 
Of these conventional examples, the optical shutter has 
been considered for a variety of applications such as 
an optical deflector in an optical switch or the like 
used for switching an optical fiber transmission line 
or terminal device, an optical printer head in an 
electrophotographic printer as an image display device 
using a one-dimensional optical shutter array, and a 
liquid crystal display using a two-dimensional liquid 
crystal cell array.  The mechanical optical deflector as an optical 
element for optical communication such as an optical 
switch can perform deflection and light shielding 
independently of the wavelength of light. For this 
reason, the mechanical optical deflector is useful when 
a multiple wavelength light source is used or a light 
source has variations in wavelength. However, the 
mechanical optical deflector is inferior to the 
solid-state optical shutter in response speed, 
compactness, array formation, and the like. Therefore, 
the application fields of the mechanical optical 
shutters are limited. A micro-mechanical member having a compact movable 
mechanism using a semiconductor photolithographic 
process has recently been taken into consideration in 
accordance with micro-mechanical techniques. Such a 
micro-mechanical member can easily form a low-cost 
array in accordance with the semiconductor 
photolithographic process and is expected to have a 
high response speed in a compact arrangement. Examples 
of the optical deflector as a mechanical optical 
element using the micro-mechanical techniques are a 
torsional scanning mirror using silicon, proposed by 
K.E. Petersen et al. (IBM J. RES, DEVELOP., VOL. 24, 
NO. 5, 9, 1980, pp. 631-637), a display device (U.S. 
Pat. No. 4,229,732), and a spatial optical deflector  
 
using an Al thin film, proposed by L.J. Hornbeck 
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2-8812). In such a
