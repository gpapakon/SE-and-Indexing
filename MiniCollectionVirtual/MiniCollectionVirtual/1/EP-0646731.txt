<ABSTRACT>
The screw head (4) is positioned so far down in a countersinking (5) of a structural part (1) that its end surface (6) is beneath the outer surface (7) of the structural part. Pressed into a cylindrical section (8) of the countersinking (5) is a disc (9) which makes contact with the screw head (4) in the centre and, at is periphery, is spaced apart from the screw head. Consequently, soiling of the screw slit is avoided. In order to dismantle the screw-connection, the disc (9) can be pressed down at the border and then easily removed.

Screw connection in two components (1,2), wherein a screw head (4) is 
countersunk in a bore (5) of the first component (1), the end face (6) of the screw 

head (4) is disposed in a recessed manner with respect to an outer surface (7) of 
the first component (1), the bore (5) comprises adjacent to the outer surface (7) a 

cylindrical portion (8) and in this cylindrical portion (8) a disc (9) is pressed in, 
characterised in that the disc (9) contacts in the middle the screw head (4) in a direct 

or indirect manner and on the edge has a spaced interval from the screw head (4), 
so that when the disc is pressed in on the edge on one side 

using a tool, it can be tilted about the middle of the screw 
head and can be removed. 
Screw connection according to claim 1, characterised in that the ratio of the 
diameter (d) to the thickness (h) of the disc (9) at its edge is greater than 10. 
Screw connection according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the outer 
surface (10) of the disc (9) which is remote from the screw head (4) is flush with the 

outer surface (7) of the first component (1). 
Screw connection according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the disc (9) consists of metal or synthetic material. 
Screw connection according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the screw 
(3) is formed as a hexagon socket screw, characterised in that a body (14) is 

inserted into the hexagon socket (13) of the screw (3) and protrudes beyond the end 
face (6) of the screw (3) and the disc (9) lies on said body. 
Screw connection according to claim 1, characterised in that the outer surface 
(7) of the first component (1) and the outer surface (10) of the disc (9) comprise 

different colours.
