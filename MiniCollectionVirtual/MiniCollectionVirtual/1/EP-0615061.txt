<ABSTRACT>
A combined cycle power plant has a plurality of 
gas turbine units (A,B) each having a gas turbine 

(3,503) and a heat recovery boiler (5,505) for 
generating steam from heat from exhaust gas from the 

gas turbine. The gas turbine (503) of a first one of 
the gas turbine units is a steam-cooled gas turbine. 

Steam turbines (19,20,21,519,520,521) are driven by 
steam from the heat recovery boilers. For start-up of 

the first gas turbine unit (A), cooling steam generated 
in a heat recovery boiler (5), not being the heat 

recovery boiler of the first gas turbine unit (A) is 
fed to the steam-cooled gas turbine (503) to effect 

cooling thereof during at least part of the start-up 
operation of said first gas turbine unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combined 
cycle power plant having prime movers driven by gas 
turbines and steam obtained from the waste heat from 
the gas turbines, and to a method of operation of such 
a plant. In a combined cycle power plant system, it is 
required to cool a high temperature part of a gas 
turbine such as the turbine moving blade. Increased efficiency of the operation of the 
combined cycle power plant can be achieved by increase 
of the gas turbine inlet temperature, but this 
temperature increase makes cooling of high temperature 
parts of the turbine more critical. Air cooling can 
consume a substantial part of the compressed air from 
the compressor driven by the turbine. In view of the 
higher specific heat and thermal conductivity of steam, 
it has been proposed to use steam to cool the high 
temperature part of the gas turbine, as disclosed in 
JP-A-4-148035. In this proposed steam cooling gas 
turbine system, heat is exchanged between the exhaust 
gas of the gas turbine and feed water by a waste heat 
recovery boiler, and the generated steam is fed to the 
high temperature part of the gas turbine to cool it.  
 
At the time of start-up when steam is not yet generated 
by the waste heat recovery boiler or at the time of 
shut-down, the compressed air of the gas turbine 
compressor is fed to the high temperature part of the 
gas turbine to cool the high temperature part. This 
temporary use of compressed air is disadvantageous, 
because the cooling structure cannot be optimized for 
both steam and air as coolants. A large amount of 
compressed air is required for cooling, reducing the 
amount available for combustion. Start-up and shut-down of a combined cycle 
power plant may typically occur once per day each, and 
therefore a rapid and efficient start-up procedure is 
required. It is mentioned that JP-B-3-41644 describes the 
supply of steam from another source to drive the steam 
turbine of a combined cycle power plant during start-up. 
The gas turbine in this plant is not steam-cooled. The object of the present invention is to 
provide a combined cycle power plant and a method of 
operation, in which steam generated by the combined 
plant is effectively used as cooling steam to cool the 
high temperature part of the gas turbine when the 
combined plant is started, particularly in the case 
where the plant has a plurality of gas turbine units. In one aspect the invention provides a combined  
 
cycle power plant having: 
(i) a plurality of gas turbine units each having 
a
