<ABSTRACT>
A developer supply container (1) includes a 
developer containing portion having an opening (2) for 

supplying the developer therefrom; a shutter (3) for 
closing the opening (2); a shutter support for supporting 

said shutter for movement between closing position 
where said shutter (3) closes the opening (2) and an opening 

position where said shutter (3) is retracted from the 
closing position to open the opening (2); and a sealing (4) 

mounted on such a side of said shutter (3) as is faced to 
the opening (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developer supplying container for replenishing developer to a developing device of an image forming apparatus such as an electrostatic copying machine, printer or the like.In such an image forming apparatus powdery toner is used as a developer. When the developer in the main assembly thereof is used up, the toner is supplied from a toner supplying container to the main assembly. The toner supplying container comprises a cylindrical or rectangular parallelepiped or the like main body made of synthetic resin material or the like and a seal for sealing an opening of the main body provided for permitting supply of the powdery toner to the developing device.Most conventional seals are in the form of an easy peel, which is bonded to the periphery of the opening by bonding material or by way of heat sealing or the like. The film is removed to permit the supply of toner. With this system, the container can not be sealed after the toner has been supplied, and therefore, the toner remaining in the container may scatter and fall.Various developer supplying containers are known with sliding type shutters. Such a container comprises a reciprocally slidable shutter, a capping member which is mounted to the opening of the container and which functions to guide the shutter, and a sealing member, disposed between the shutter and the capping member, for sealing the container. The opening of the container is opened by moving the slidable shutter to permit the toner in the container to be supplied into the main assembly. After completion of the toner supply to the main assembly, the shutter is closed, so that the sealing of the container is reestablished, and therefore, even if some toner remains in the container, the container can be removed without possibility of the toner scattering. The material of the sealing member in this case is for example, foamed polyurethane, foamed polyethylene, rubber, rubber sponge or another elastic material, which is compressed between the shutter and the capping member to provide the sealing.Generally, in the case of the slidable shutter type container, the sealing member between the shutter and the capping member is in the form of a ring extended around the toner supplying opening. However, with this structure, a flange of the cap is required to have a portion to which the sealing member is bonded and a guiding portion for the shutter, with the result of a tendency to increase the size of the capping member. When the developer hopper of the main assembly

<CLAIMS>
A developer supplying container for an electrophotographic image-forming apparatus (P), comprising:

a developer containing portion (1) having an opening (1a) through which developer can be supplied from the containing portion;
a manually-operable shutter (3) for opening and closing the opening (1a), said shutter being provided on a side facing said opening with an elastic sealing member (4);
guiding means (2, 2c) for guiding opening and closing of said shutter, said guiding means having guide portions (2c) for guiding respective lateral sides of the shutter, said guiding portions having configurations substantially sandwiching said sealing member (4) and said shutter (3) to prevent leakage of the developer;
wherein said sealing member (4) continuously extends over a region corresponding to said opening (1a) and a region corresponding to said guide portions (2c) where said guiding means directly sandwich said sealing member and said shutter, and
characterised in that
 said shutter (3) has a rigidity sufficient to cooperate with said guiding means to compress said sealing member by 10 to 30%;
and 
in that
 the side of said shutter which is opposite to the sealing member has a low friction
 material thereon for sliding relative to said guiding means (2, 2c).
A container according to claim 1, wherein said shutter has a bending elasticity of 20,000 - 100,000 kg/cm
2
, preferably 50,000 - 80,000 kg/cm
2
.
A container according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the sealing member is of rubber or sponge material.
A container according to claim 3, wherein a compression stress of the sealing member is 0.1 - 2.0 kg/cm
2
, preferably 0.6 - 1.5 kg/cm
2
.
A container according to any preceding claim, wherein said sealing member and said shutter are two-colour-injection-moulded.
A containing according to any preceding claim, wherein said shutter (3) has a grip portion (3c) for facilitating opening and closing thereof.
