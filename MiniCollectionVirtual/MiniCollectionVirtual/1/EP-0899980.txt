<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, a telecommunication network comprises
an operation and maintenance device and a plurality of

network elements each of them comprising hardware objects. At
least one network element communicates state changes to the

operation and maintenance device. The operation and maintenance
device comprising a memory device and a processing

device. The memory device stores a state dependency graph
with objects, states of the objects and operators, and a set

of rules allocated to the operators. The processing device
processes the communicated state changes by applying the

rules to the operators of the graph and calculates the new
states of all objects that depend on the communicated state

change.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telecommunication network
and a state propagation method for monitoring and performing
the state propagation of various objects of network elements.Operation, maintenance, and administration functions exist in
any telecommunication network. The GSM (global system for
mobile communication) specification covers these functions,
too. The general philosophy of telecommunication management
networks is that all management operation will take place on
an abstract representation of network elements. The information
model of GSM, see M. Mouly, M.B.Pautet, The GSM System
for Mobile Communications", 1992, gives an abstract system
view.Network elements are modeled as managed objects (MOs). More
generally, managed objects represent anything which is
managed. For example, the information model covers also
managed objects such as tests or observations. The objects
themselfs are instances of classes. A class is a description
of the attributes, properties, and actions which are common
to all objects belonging to the class. The concept of generic
GSM object classes is very close to object oriented
programming.Generic states and status attributes are used to describe the
operability and availablity of the managed objects. For
instance, the state of a managed object may be locked,
disabled or degraded. Between the managed objects there may
exist complex relationships. The relationship stem from the
GSM containement tree, the hardware architecture, the wiring
of the boards, the grouping of boards to functional units
etc. Generally, any state transition of a managed object may 
result in a sequence of state changes of other related
managed objects.These dependencies are described as relationships in the
source code of a maintenance software for a network element.
This code is complex and difficult to adapt in case of a
hardware modification of the network element. Large numbers
of managed objects cause a breakdown of this concept,
espacially if all multiple faults are considered.An objective of the present invention is therefore to identify
a telecommunication network and a state propagation method
which manage even a large number of managed objects and which
guarantees the state consistency of all managed objects even
in the case of multiple faults. The objective is achieved by
the telecommunication network according to Patent Claim 1 and
the method according to Patent Claim 14.According to the invention, a telecommunication network comprises
an operation and maintenance device and a
