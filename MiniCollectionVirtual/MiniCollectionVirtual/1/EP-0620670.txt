<ABSTRACT>
In a digital imaging system including an array of imaging 
devices that image a substrate in a lateral series of adjacent 

longitudinal swaths, methods and apparatus for correcting 
device offset and hiding between regions imaged by adjacent 

devices. Along the direction of imaging (i.e., the dimension 
along which the imaging device(s) and the substrate move 

relative to one another during an imaging pass), adjustments 
take the form of compensating increases or decreases to the 

normal intervals between discharges to adjacent image points. 
Transverse to the direction of imaging, the invention 

compensates for imprecise device orientation and "seam" 
artifacts by, first, commencing imaging with the device having 

the greatest offset from proper orientation, and second, as a 
fine adjustment, repeating at least one imaging swath to 

produce intentional transverse overlap between adjacent swaths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to digital imaging, and in
particular to control systems for processing digitally stored
images prior to output to imaging devices.Various methods and technologies exist for encoding
images digitally and transferring the digital representations
to output devices. At the encoding stage, these range from
hobbyist scanners and graphic-arts software to elaborate
prepress systems, and at the output stage can include laser
printing, digital exposure of photographic films, and transfer
of the image to lithographic plates for subsequent mass-quantity
printing. In the latter case, suitable techniques of
plate production include the use of electromagnetic-radiation
pulses, produced by one or more laser or non-laser sources, to
create physical or chemical changes at selected points of
sensitized plate blanks, which are used (immediately or after
exposure to conventional development processes) for
planographic printing; ink-jet equipment used to selectively
deposit ink-repellent or ink-accepting spots on plate blanks,
also to produce planographic printing plates; and spark-discharge
equipment, in which an electrode in contact with or
spaced close to a plate blank produces electrical sparks to
alter the characteristics of certain areas on a printing
surface, thereby producing "dots" which collectively form a
desired image. As used herein, the term "imaging device"
includes radiation sources, ink-jet sources, electrodes and 
other known means of producing image spots on blank printing
plates, and the term "discharge" means the image-forming
emissions produced by these devices.In a typical laser-based imaging configuration, laser
output is provided directly to the surface of a substrate via
lenses or other beam-guiding components, or transmitted to the
surface from a remotely sited laser using a fiber-optic cable.
A controller and associated positioning hardware maintains the
beam output at a precise orientation with respect to the
substrate surface, scans the output over the surface, and
activates the laser at positions adjacent selected points or
areas of the substrate. The controller responds to incoming
image signals corresponding to the original document or picture
being copied onto the substrate to produce a precise negative
or positive image of that original. The image signals are
stored as a bitmap data file on a computer. Such files may be
generated by a raster image processor (RIP) or other suitable
means. For example, a RIP can accept input data in page-description
language,

A method for use in a digital imaging system including
an array (65, 150) of a plural number of imaging devices

respective plural number of spaced apart imaging dots on

a substrate (55), means for bearing (50) the substrate

continuous longitudinal movement of the array (65, 150)
