The control faces are divided into sections in the longitudinal direction of the bridge, and a plurality of detectors (19, 26) are provided for measuring the movements of the bridge girder. A local control unit (20, 25) associated with each control face section is adapted to control the control face section in response to information from one or more of said detectors. In a method according to the invention the control faces (14, 15, 16, 17, 34, 35, 36) are divided into sections in the longitudinal direction of the bridge, and a plurality of detectors (19, 26) measure the movements of the bridge girder, following which a local control unit (20, 25) associated with each control face section controls the control face section in question in response to information from one or more of said detectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a system and a method of counteracting 
wind induced oscillations in bridge girders on long 
cable supported bridges, wherein a plurality of control 
faces arranged substantially symmetrically about the longitudinal 
axis of the bridge utilize the energy of the 
wind for automatically reducing said oscillations in response to the movement of the bridge girder. In connection with long-span bridges having insufficient 
stiffness and damping, oscillations may occur because of 
aerodynamic instability. At worst, these oscillations may 
be fatal and cause the bridges to collapse. The oscillations 
may also be termed flutter. They may be torsional 
oscillations or vertical oscillations or a combination of 
these. For example, it was torsional oscillations which 
caused the Tacoma bridge in the USA to fail in 1940, which 
was the longest suspension bridge in the world at that 
time. Aerodynamic instability occurs when the aerodynamic forces 
reduce the torsional stiffness of the bridge girder, or 
the total damping (structural as well as aerodynamic) 
becomes negative, which means that the bridge receives 
more energy than is absorbed in the oscillatory motion. 
The wind velocity at which aerodynamic instability occurs 
is called the flutter wind velocity or the critical wind 
velocity, and it decreases with decreasing structural 
stiffness and damping. Traditionally, the problem is solved by e.g. increasing 
the stiffness of the bridge girder or by mounting mechanical 
damper devices. For a given cross-section of the  
 
bridge girder its torsional stiffness decreases with increasing 
span. When the span is increased, it is therefore 
necessary also to increase the bridge cross-section to 
establish the sufficient torsional stiffness. However, the 
increased bridge cross-section gives rise to greater wind 
loads, which in turn involves increased demands on the 
structural stength of the bridge girder and thus adds to 
the costs of construction. Furthermore, owing to the desired 
appearance of the bridge there is of course a limit 
to the increase in the bridge girder cross-section. These 
circumstances have thus set an upper limit to the spans 
that can be achieved. From US-A-4 741 063 a system is known that uses control 
faces for counteracting the wind induced oscillations in a 
bridge girder utilizing the energy of the wind. A face is 
placed on each side of the longitudinal axis of the 
bridge. The faces are preferably firmly fixed, but they 
may be adjustable in position, even
