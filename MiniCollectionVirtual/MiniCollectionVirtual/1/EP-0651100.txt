<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a connector (1) in 
which the connector (1) can be inserted into or fixed to in advance the 

abutting surfaces of the structural members to be connected, an adjustment 
of direction of the connector is not required, its workability and 

installing work can be remarkably improved at the same time the connector (1) 
inserted into and fixed during connection can be prevented from being 

pulled off and its superior high safety in shearing resistance is 
attained. 
This connector (1) is comprised of a connecting plate (2) formed in a flat 
plate; a hollow tubular member (3) having its one end fixed to both surfaces 

of said connecting plate (2) and the other end opened; a branch pipe (8) engage 
part (7) communicating from a side part of the base end of said tubular 

member (3) to hollow part; a hollow branch pipe (8) having an engage part (9) 
removably engaged with the branch pipe engage part (7) formed at at least 

one end thereof; and a fixing hole (12) formed at a predetermined part of 
the connecting plate (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector for use in connecting inter-timbers, 
inter-laminated woods, inter-stone members, inter-concrete 
members, or between timbers, laminated woods and stone members, concrete 
members and the like. In recent years, there have been developed the connectors for use in 
connecting between a beam and a pole plate, between a pole plate and a 
column, between a furring and an independent column so as to provide a 
labour saving and a streamlining of the work in a building such as a 
dwelling and the like or similarly developed a connection structure or a 
coupling structure so as to get a streamlining of the work. For example, 1 ○ the gazette of Japanese U. M. Laid-Open No. Sho 63-162008 
discloses a framework jig used in a wooden framework process, 2 ○ 
the gazette of Japanese U. M. Laid-Open No. Hei 2-93401 discloses a 
reinforcing jig at a connection part between a lower end of a column and 
a foundation of a framework type wooden building, 3 ○ the gazette of 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 3-295946 discloses trap dowel jig and a 
lathing structure of the framework wooden building applied with the trap 
dowel jig, 4 ○ the gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 2-300442 
discloses a connecting structure of wooden structural material in which 
the wooden framework is not decomposed after connection. In these prior 
arts, fittings, bolts and nuts are used at the connection between the 
structural members.  In addition, as the connection structure, Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. Sho 63-14939, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 63-14940 and Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No. Sho 63-14941 disclose the connection structure in 
the wooden framework structure so as to improve a structural strength of 
the connection structure. However, there were problems that the aforesaid prior art connector 
or connector structure required a large number of parts such as bolts, 
nuts, washers and the like, a troublesome fixing work was required and a 
lack of workability occurred when they were worked. In addition, it had 
other problems that the metal fitting was large in size, had a heavy 
weight, it was lacked in a transporting characteristic and lacked in 
safety at a high location. There was also another problem that an erroneous metal fitting 
occurred during the work, a troublesome operation was needed, an embedding 
of the cylinder or plug member punched at the predetermined position into 
a desired location and a threadable fitting of bolts into said embedded 
cylinder or the
