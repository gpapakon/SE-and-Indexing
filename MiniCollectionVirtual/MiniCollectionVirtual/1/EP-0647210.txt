<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONSCAVENGING OF HYDROGEN SULPHIDEThe present invention relates to the scavenging or removal of hydrogen sulphide. More particularly it relates to the removal of hydrogen sulphide from a gaseous medium, a liquid medium or the like.The present invention is of general applicability to hydrogen sulphide removal from situations in which it is an undesired contaminant. Such situations include contamination of hydrocarbon deposits in the oil industry and products of the sewage industry. It is, however, of particular applicability to the removal of hydrogen sulphide which occurs in the extraction of hydrocarbons and associated water from subterranean deposits, for example, those deposits which are beneath the sea-bed, for example in the North Sea. It may also be used, for example, for the removal of hydrogen sulphide occurring in liquid/gas media after extraction, i.e. during production.The presence of hydrogen sulphide associated with many hydrocarbons and possibly associated water deposits may arise from the action of microorganisms on organic sulphur compounds occurring therein. Particularly as hydrocarbons and possibly associated water are removed from subterranean deposits, water, for example sea water, is introduced into the 

hydrocarbon bearing formation, particularly to maintain the pressure therein. The hydrocarbons(liquid and/or gas) removed from subterranean deposits can be associated with water, and also can have present therein hydrogen sulphide as an undesired contaminant. Unless the hydrogen sulphide can be satisfactorily removed, it constitutes a hazard even at low concentrations and as the level increases it can lead to premature closure of the well which extracts the hydrocarbons and associated water from a particular hydrocarbon bearing formation.Since removal of as much of the hydrocarbons as possible is desired from any particular hydrocarbon bearing formation, any means of removing the hydrogen sulphide from the hydrocarbons and associated water represents the solution of a problem in the industry.The concentration of hydrogen sulphide in such hydrocarbons and associated water mixture (usually an emulsion) may be, for example, of the order of 5 -1000 pp . If it is not removed, it may find its way into the sea, or be flashed off into the atmosphere, particularly in the atmosphere associated with an extraction process for separating the liquid and/or gaseous hydrocarbon from its associated water. Such extraction is conventionally conducted on a platform which may be adjacent to or
