<ABSTRACT>
An inexpensive arrangement for mounting multiple, 
closely spaced integrated circuit chips (18, 20, 22, 24) on 

a low temperature co-fired ceramic substrate (10) uses a 
mandrel-produced thin film decal (26) having patterns of 

interconnecting conductive traces (34, 46, 47) that connect 
to the fine pitch connecting pads (60) of the integrated 

circuit chips at one end and connect to the relatively 
coarse pitch connecting pads (50) of the low temperature 

co-fired ceramic substrate at the other end. The 
interconnect decal is formed independently of the LTCC 

substrate and is provided with chip connections at a pitch 
of about 0.004 inches. The interconnect pads of the decal 

are connected by conductive traces on the decal to the LTCC 
pads which have a pitch in the order of about .01 inches or 

greater. The decal, which is formed independently of the 
LTCC substrate, is connected to the substrate pads by a one 

of several different electrically conductive adhesives, 
including silver loaded epoxy, Z-axis conductive epoxy and 

anisotropically and isotropically conductive epoxy or low 
melting temperature solder. The decal enables use of a 

"fan-out" arrangement in which connections are routed under 
the chip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multichip integrated 
circuit module assemblies and more particularly relates to 
an improved arrangement for coupling fine pitch pads of 
integrated circuit chips to coarse pitch pads of an 
interconnection substrate. Many types of electronic devices employ a number of 
integrated circuit chips which are interconnected to one 
another and assembled in a single package or module. These 
multichip modules may employ state of the art semiconductor 
devices that are typically 0.5 x 0.5 inches in size with 
peripherally positioned input output contacts having a 
0.004 inch pitch (e.g. center to center spacing). This 
pitch requires use of connecting lines and spaces between 
lines of 0.002 inches. Most commonly these multichip 
modules are mounted on multilayer polyimide dielectric 
substrates that employ thin film processes for forming 
electrically conductive traces to interconnect with the 
various chip contacts. The multilayer dielectric 
substrates are made employing techniques that have been  
 
initially developed for various types of semiconductor 
processing. They can be made with fine pitch traces but 
are time consuming and expensive to fabricate. A different, less costly technology, termed Low 
Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC), has been developed for 
forming multilayer interconnecting circuits for multilayer 
electronic packages. LTCC technology employs multiple 
layers of ceramic tape processed by thick film techniques 
to provide conductive circuit traces and interconnections 
extending between the many layers of the LTCC module. The 
LTCC module is capable of high volume low cost 
manufacturing but is subject to the limitation of 
relatively coarse pitch interconnecting traces and vias. 
In the LTCC process, metalization is applied using thick 
film technology which limits the pitch of conductors and 
connecting elements to approximately 0.016 inches. 
Attempts to provide LTCC modules with a much finer pitch 
greatly degrades the manufacturing yield. In general, the 
requirement of a coarse pitch is not a major handicap for 
LTCC processing since a large number of layers of this 
multilayer substrate can be employed. However, fine pitch 
lines or connections cannot be formed in the LTCC module, 
and thus, an integrated circuit chip having a set of fine 
pitch peripheral contacts cannot be mounted on or otherwise 
accommodated on the top layer of the multilayer LTCC 
module. Arrangements for directly connecting the 
peripheral contact pads of the integrated
