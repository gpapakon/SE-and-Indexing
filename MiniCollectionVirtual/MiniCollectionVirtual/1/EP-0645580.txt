<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for illuminating tunnels by
means of a linear type light source.More particularly, this invention concems a system for
illuminating tunnels by means of a linear light source, comprising a
continuous type illumination path adapted to enable both the pavement of
the tunnel and its lining as well as particular marking locations thereof to
be contemporaneously illuminated.As it is well known, the conventional tunnel illumination
systems are divided into two types according to the types of lamps used
therein.The systems of a first type use high or low pressure sodium
lamps and quinconce arranged fixtures, attached to a steel channel which
is overhung from the vault of the tunnel at a level of 5,50 m from the
pavement, a distance of about 12 m being provided between two
successive lamps.Due to its construction, this system has the following
drawbacks: a noticeable illumination uneveness; a badly delineated
planimetric pattern of the tunnel, which is based in this case exclusively
upon retroreflectors; a noticeable maintenance difficulty due to the fact
that the illumination plant is arranged above the traffic; the creation of
very sharp shadows and of an absolutely negative effect caused by the
intersection of the light beam and of the vault surface.The second currently used system provides for employment of
illumination fixtures with three band fluorescent lamps having a length of
1,20 m and forming effectively continuous illumination lines.The fixtures are laterally arranged at a low height level.When tunnels lined by aluminium sheeting or by valuable
concrete panels are involved, the combination is hardly possible and it is
not generally possible to correctly illuminate also the lining when the
pavement is correctly illuminated.Furthermore, DE-U-91 04 502.9 discloses an illumination
system consisting of a number of successively combined tubular modules 
comprising a light ray source and light emission duct for propagation of
said light rays, wherein said light ray source element has an inwardly
mirrored surface and said light ray duct is light transparent.From the above, it can be realized that all of the presently
adopted systems have noticeable disadvantages both from the view point
of the possibility to illuminate the vanous portions of the tunnel, and in 
respect of the complication and manufacturing costs for producing the
illumination plant, as well as in respect of the possibility to perform
maintenance operations under traffic conditions.It is, therefore, apparent
