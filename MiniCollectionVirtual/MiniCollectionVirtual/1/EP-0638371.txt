<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to servicing of large
containers. It relates more specifically to a method of
servicing an interior of a large container, and to a
servicing apparatus suitable for use inside a large
container.It is envisaged that this invention will
advantageously be applicable in inspection, maintenance and
other services, like cleaning, in respect of large vessels
or containers in the food and beverage industry, the petrochemical
industry, or the like. The invention is, however,
not limited to those fields. French Patent Document 2 289 249 discloses cleaning of
a large, round, cylindrical container tank having a narrow access
opening in a top thereof by lowering a collapsible support by
means of a winch mounted at a high elevation on a gantry crane
via the narrow opening into the tank. The collapsible support
is supported via a rigid post extending from an external support
base mounted on the gantry crane through the opening. The
collapsible support has radial arms pivoted at inner ends thereof
to a bottom of the rigid post, to allow the radial arms to be
pivoted between closed conditions alongside the post to open
conditions extending radially decumbently from the post. Stays
are pivoted at inner ends thereof to a bush around the post and
at outer ends thereof to the radial arms at positions spaced
toward outer ends of the radial arms. The bush is displaceable
up and down the post by means of lead screws driven from an
electric motor mounted on the gantry crane. Appropriate
displacement of the bush selectively opens and closes the radial
arms. The radial arms carry rams which can be extended to abut
an inner wall surface of the tank to anchor the collapsible
support. The collapsible support can be pivoted by withdrawing
the rams and turning the post by means of torque providing means
mounted on the external base on the gantry crane.US patent document 5 179 757 discloses a collapsible
support which is similar to the disclosure in French patent
document 2 289 249 in many respects and differs therefrom in that
the collapsible support is suspended by means of a flexible cable
extending into the tank, in that the radial arms are openable and
closable by displacement of the bush by means of a hydraulic
piston and cylinder arrangement; in that the collapsible support
supports a working tool such as to form a stable base for the 
working tool from which it can be rotated relative to the stable
base and tilted relative to the stable base.In accordance with the present invention, there is
provided a

recumbently alongside the chine, and a deployed condition in
which the respective arm extends generally radially away

from the chine;
deploying means (32; 132, 140) connected between the
chine and the respective arms and being selectively operable

to cause progressive pivoting of the arms between their
collapsed conditions and their deployed conditions, and

between their deployed conditions and their collapsed
conditions;
stays (34; 134) connected between the respective arms
and the chine to stay the respective arms against the chine

such as to be able to support weight when the arms are in
their deployed conditions; and
elevating means comprising a winch (22; 122) and an
elongate flexible suspension element (20; 120) around the

winch and operatively connected by said connection means to
the chine;

the method including

operating the deploying means to pivot the arms to
their collapsed conditions;
lowering the chine with the arms in their collapsed
conditions via the narrow access opening into the container

to a desired level and suspending the chine within the
container;
operating the deploying means to pivot the arms to
their deployed conditions;

the method being characterised by

abutting the inner surface of the circular 
cylindrical wall of the container by means of a roller (46;

146, 222) mounted at the radially outer end of each arm by
means of mounting means (48; 148, 218, 219) which allow

resilient extension and contraction of each arm, the rollers
being arranged symmetrically around the chine, and by
rotating the device within the container by means of
first rotary drive means (66; 200) driving against the inner

surface of said cylindrical wall (18; 118);
operation of the deploying means being by means of
second rotary drive means (38; 138) supported on the chine

within the container, the deploying means (32; 132, 140)
being drivingly connected to the second rotary drive means

to be selectively operable by means of the second rotary
drive means.

inner end and an outer end, each arm being pivoted (30; 130)

by its inner end to the chine for pivoting between a
collapsed condition in which the respective arm extends

recumbently alongside the chine to allow the service
apparatus to pass through the narrow access opening, and a

suspension means to suspend the chine in use within the

container via the narrow access opening and to raise and
lower the chine in the container,

the service apparatus being characterised by

a separate roller (46; 146, 222) mounted at the
radially outer end of each arm by means of mounting means

(48; 148, 218, 219) allowing each arm to be resiliently
displaceable within limits to allow limited extension and

contraction of each arm, the rollers being positioned
generally on a circle diameter falling in a predetermined
