<ABSTRACT>
A servo control system for a shock-proof disk player comprising a digital 
signal processor (10), a voltage-controlled oscillator (88), a reference clock 

generator (90), a clock mode changeover switch (89), a phase comparator (92) for 
controlling a head-rotating spindle motor (2), and a bulk memory (23) of a large 

capacity for storage of data, wherein the phase lock of a PLL at the time of a seek 
is switched on or off under control to thereby shorten the required seek time. The 

clock signal frequency is selectively changed in such a manner as to lock the PLL 
in accordance with the rotation rate, whereby the power consumption can be 

lowered. The bulk memory (23) is used as a data buffer, and the servo system is 
controlled as the data are read out from the memory while the data quantity stored 

and left therein is detected, so that a reduction of the power consumption can be 
achieved with another advantage of enhancing the resistance against shock.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disk player for reproducing recorded audio
data from a digital audio disk such as CD (Compact Disc) or MD (Mini Disc)
(hereinafter referred to as disk), and more particularly to a disk player wherein the
audio data reproduced from a disk are once stored in a bulk memory of a large
capacity and then are read out therefrom to be outputted. And the invention further
relates to a servo system for use in such a disk player.In disk players inclusive of CD players, there is known a shock-proof
type
the construction of which is so contrived that, when any track jump is caused
during reproduction of recorded data due to some external disturbance such as
shock, the continuity of the reproduced data is maintained to prevent occurrence of
any sound skip.Here, "track jump" signifies a phenomenon that a data-reading light spot of
an optical pickup for reading out the recorded data while following up a record
track (pit string) on a disk jumps the record track.In an ordinary CD player, a data rate for reproduction of the recorded data
from a disk (hereinafter referred to as reproduction data rate) is equal to a data rate
for outputting the audio data (hereinafter referred to as output data rate).However, in any conventional shock-proof type CD player, a disk is driven
at a higher rotation speed which is twice the normal speed in an ordinary CD
player, so that the data are read at a reproduction data rate higher than that in the
ordinary CD player and, while the read data thus obtained are stored temporarily in
a bulk memory of a large capacity, the stored data are read from the bulk memory
at the same output data rate as in the ordinary CD player.And when there occurs a track jump during data reproduction, the data-reading
light spot of the optical pickup is returned to the position immediately
before occurrence of such a track jump, and the data reproduction is resumed from
that position while the reproduced audio data obtained after resumption of the
reproduction are linked, by utilizing the stored data in the bulk memory, to the
preceding audio data reproduced immediately before occurrence of the track jump,
whereby the continuity of the reproduced audio data is maintained to consequently
prevent generation of any sound skip.Furthermore, in the known construction where the normal rotation speed of a
disk is twice the velocity in an ordinary CD player, each of servo systems for 
focus, tracking, sled and spindle control is kept in operation, and when the data
quantity stored in the

<CLAIMS>
A disk player having a first servo means (18) for controlling the rotation
speed of a disk (1) and a second servo means (26) for controlling the operation of

an optical pickup (3) which reads recorded data from the disk (1), wherein the data
are read from the disk at a first data rate and then are stored in a bulk memory (23)

of a large capacity, while the stored data are read out from said bulk memory at a
second data rate lower than said first data rate, said disk player further comprising:


a memory control means (22) for monitoring the data quantity stored in
said bulk memory (23) and outputting a first control signal when the data quantity

has exceeded a first preset value, or outputting a second control signal when the
data quantity has become smaller than a second preset value lower than said first

preset value; and
a servo control means (20) for turning off said first and second servo
means (18, 26) in response to said first control signal, or turning on said first and

second servo means (18, 26) in response to said second control signal,
characterised in that said second pre-set value is the data quantity corresponding to

a necessary read time period for attaining the completely steady operating state of
at least said first servo means (18).
A disk player according to claim 1, characterised in that said second pre-set
value is the data quantity corresponding to a necessary read time period for

attaining the completely steady operating state of said first servo means (18) and
said second servo means (26).
