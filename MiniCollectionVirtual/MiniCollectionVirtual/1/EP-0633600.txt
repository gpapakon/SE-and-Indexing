<ABSTRACT>
A thin film forming apparatus, a collimator (30) adapted to 
function as a particle getter is disposed between a target 

(22) and a wafer (32). The collimator (30) is fabricated by 
assembling a plurality of embossed, slitted particle getter 

sheets (65, 66) into a lattice (40) honeycomb, or other 
structure having a number of rows of openings, and fixing the 

assembly into a frame (41). The particle getter sheets 
capture and hold particles and thereby prevent particle 

generation that would otherwise result when deposited films 
peel off of the collimator surface, without deteriorating the 

performance of the collimator (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the formation of thin films 
on substrates. Vapor phase growth technology is widely used to form many 
different types of thin films, e.g. thin films for the 
electrodes and diffusion barriers of integrated circuits, 
magnetic films for magnetic recording media, and clear 
conductive films of indium-tin oxide ( ITO'') for liquid 
crystal display units. Thin film formation techniques using 
vapor phase film growth technology include chemical vapor 
phase growth methods, such as thermal decomposition, hydrogen 
reduction, disproportionation reactions, and plasma chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD); physical vapor phase methods, such as 
vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering, and ion beam techniques; 
and other discharge polymerization methods. For example, in 
a sputtering process, a target and a substrate, such as a 
semiconductor wafer, are located opposite of each other, and 
atoms released from the target by sputtering are deposited 
onto the substrate to form a thin film thereon. Continuing advances in the integration of electronic devices 
have created a need for new techniques of forming thin films. 
In at least one process for fabricating semiconductor devices 
on a semiconductor substrate, it is necessary to coat wafers 
having deep pits in the wafer surface with a uniform film 
(see Fig. 1). The coating 12,13 that is sputtered onto the 
wafer 15 from the target 10 must also cover the bottom 
surface of each pit 14. In ordinary sputtering, a majority 
of sputtered atoms are scattered aslant with respect to the 
wafer surface. The atoms are unable to travel deep into the 
pit, and are deposited mostly around the inlet opening of the  
 
pit. Consequently, it is not possible to form a uniform film 
on the wafer surface that extends to the bottom of the pit 
using conventional sputtering techniques. A technique referred to as collimation sputtering is known. 
See, for example Japanese Patent Application Public 
Disclosure No. 123021/1991 (see, also Fig. 2). Collimation 
sputtering uses a collimator 16 that is disposed between a 
substrate 15 on which a film 17 is to be formed and a film 
forming source 10 that is held opposite to the substrate in a 
film forming apparatus. The collimator 16 only allows 
sputtered atoms to pass therethrough in the direction 
perpendicular to the surface of the substrate. Thus, in 
collimation sputtering the collimator 16 captures obliquely 
scattering atoms and passes only the atoms that are sputtered 
perpendicularly to the wafer surface.
