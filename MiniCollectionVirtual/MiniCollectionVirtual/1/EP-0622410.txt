<ABSTRACT>
Syndiotactic polypropylene is blended with isotactic 
polypropylene and the blend melt processed into medical 

articles. The blends have molding cycle times which are 
up to 12 times shorter that for pure syndiotactic 

polypropylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
1. Field of the Invention. This invention relates
to plastic articles, and more particularly relates to
medical articles of syndiotactic polypropylene
compositions and a process for their manufacture.2. Background of the Invention. Molding is a
process in which melted or plasticized polymeric material
is forced into a mold where it is held until removed in a
solid state having a shape which duplicates the cavity of
the mold. The process consists of three basic operations:
1) raising the temperature of the plastic to a point where
it will flow under pressure into the mold cavity,
(2) allowing the plastic to solidify in the mold
(conventionally referred to as hold time) while
maintaining pressure during removal of heat, and
(3) opening the mold to eject the plastic permanently
frozen in the shape of the mold. The productivity of the
molding operation depends on the speed of melting the
plastic, the speed of injection and ejection, and the hold
time required to cool and solidify the product in the
mold. Thus, in the molding art, cycle time is defined as
the time required for one complete operation of a molding
press from closing time to closing time. In most molding
operations, the largest part of the cycle time is the hold
time, which generally accounts for up to 80% of the cycle
time, and may be as high as 95%.Prolypropylene has long been used in molding and
extruding operations for articles such as containers and
films for the food packaging industry, and is known to
exist in three forms. In isotactic polypropylene (IPP), 
the methyl groups are attached to the tertiary carbon
atoms of successive monomeric units on the same side of a
hypothetical plane through the polymer chain.
Syndiotactic polypropylene (SPP) has the methyl groups
attached on alternating sides of the polymer chain.
Atactic polypropylene (APP) has the methyl groups attached
randomly with respect to the polymer chain. APP is
essentially a waxy product of low melting point whereas
SPP and IPP are crystalline and of higher melting point.Conventional molding and extruding grades of
polypropylene are substantially isotactic, and, depending
on the polymerization catalyst and conditions, contain
various amounts of monomeric units having other
configurations.SPP, although known for many years in various degrees
of syndiotactic purity, has been only a laboratory
curiosity until recently. A new crystalline SPP of
exceptionally high syndiotacticity purity prepared by a
process using syndiospecific metallocene catalysts is
disclosed by Ewen et al.

b) holding said blend in said mold until said blend crystallises in said mold to
give an article having the shape of said mold; and
c) ejecting said article from said mold, wherein method steps (a) to (c) are
complete in a cycle time at least four fold less than the cycle time required to

complete steps (a) to (c) with the pure syndiotactic polypropylene used in a
step (a).

give an article having the shape of said mold; and
c) ejecting said article from said mold, wherein method steps (a) to (c) are
complete in a cycle time at least ten fold less than the cycle time required to

complete steps (a) to (c) with the pure syndiotactic polypropylene used in
step (a).
