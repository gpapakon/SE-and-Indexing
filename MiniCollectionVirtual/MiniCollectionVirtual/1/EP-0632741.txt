<ABSTRACT>
For selective reduction of the NO-content in exhaust gases from a kiln plant, a method is described according to which a mixture of ammonia and water is introduced into the exhaust gases. According to this method the ammonia and water is mixed just prior to being sprayed into the kiln plant by the ammonia being dosed into a preferably even stream of water. Hence an inexpensive and efficient removal of the NO-content in the exhaust gases is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for selective 
reduction of NO-content of exhaust gases from a kiln plant 
by means of ammonia, according to which method the ammonia 
is introduced into the NO-containing exhaust gases in the 
presence of oxygen (02) at a temperature between 700째 and 
1100째C. The invention also relates to an apparatus for 
carrying out the method. A method of the aforementioned kind is known from the 
description of US patent No. 3900554. This patent provides 
a general description of the method in terms of the 
necessary quantities of ammonia and oxygen which must be 
present and the temperature range within which the process 
must take place. However, the patent does not provide any 
solutions of the practical implementation of the method. By use of this method a number of problems will occur. 
For example, if liquid ammonia from a pressure tank is 
used, in which tank the ammonia is normally kept at its 
boiling point, then the ammonia will tend to boil up when 
it is conveyed to the point of application, which will 
typically be located at a higher level than the tank, which 
again, besides giving rise to cavitation problems, makes it 
difficult to control the supply rate of ammonia to the 
exhaust gases. This problem may simply be solved by 
increasing the hydraulic pressure of the ammonia, for 
example by means of a pump, but this would require that the 
pressure is lowered again, for example in a nozzle 
injecting the ammonia, but it has then turned out that the 
nozzle employed for spraying the ammonia into the exhaust 
gases has a very limited service life. Practical experience has further shown that 
introduction of pure ammonia into an exhaust gas will not 
lead to any reduction of the NO-content; instead, the NO-content 
will be increased due to the fact that the ammonia 
is burnt off  
 
in the exhaust gas duct, giving rise to NO-formation. Finally, it has turned out to be difficult to obtain a 
uniform and constant flow of ammonia into the exhaust gases 
to be cleaned, a satisfactory distribution of the ammonia 
in the exhaust gases and besides to have the ammonia 
charged into the exhaust gases at the locations where the 
temperature and the oxygen content is optimal for the 
chemical processes. One method suggested for solving the distribution problems 
involves vapourization and dilution of the ammonia in a 
large airstream, which is subsequently distributed to a 
number of spraying points. However, this solution has a 
distinct disadvantage in that the amount of false
