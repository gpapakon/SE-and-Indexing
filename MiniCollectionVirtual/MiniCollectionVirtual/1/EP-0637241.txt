<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists of a combination of a substance that increases the intragastric pH and an acid degradable antibacterial compound. By this combined product regimen it will be possible to obtain maximal local antibacterial effect of acid degradable antibiotics as well as enhanced bioavailability of the active antibiotic, thus resulting in higher amounts of the active compound in the gastric mucosa due to secretion of weak bases. Both pharmacological effects contribute to drastically increased antimicrobial capacity of acid degradable antibiotics to be used against local infections in the gastrointestinal tract causing gastritis and/or peptic ulcer. The invention also selects to the use of said combination and a process for the preparation thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combination of a
substance with inhibiting effect on the gastric acid
secretion, thus a substance which increases the
intragastric pH e.g. proton pump inhibitors, histamin-H2-blockers
and one or more antibacterial compounds which
are acid degradable.In the treatment of the peptic ulcer disease current
therapy aims at reducing the gastric acid secretion, thus
resulting in a recess of the injuries in the gastro-intestinal
tract. Inhibitors of the gastric acid
secretion, proton pump inhibitors in particular, induce a
rapid relief of pain and other symptoms associated with
the ulcer disease. However, relapses of the disease is a
documented fact. Since gastric antisecretory therapy only
leads to reduction of the major tissue irritating factor,
gastric acid, the plausible cause of the disease,
Helicobacter pylori, remains mainly unaffected.
(Helicobacter pylori was earlier named Campylobacter
pylori.)Helicobacter pylori is affected by certain antibiotic
compounds e.g. macrolides and penicillins as has been
shown in vitro and in vivo. However, these products are
degraded into nonantibacterial metabolites in the 
presence of gastric acid, which drastically reduces their
antibacterial efficacy.In view of the widespread use of antimicrobial pharmaceuticals
in the treatment of infectious diseases or for
other purposes and the consequent emergence of drug-resistant
strains, increased incidence of microbial
substitution due to disturbance of the normal bacterial
flora, changes in profile of infectious diseases, etc.,
there has been a constant demand for the development of
new antimicrobial agents or combinations thereof.Proton inhibitors e.g. omeprazole and its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts, which are used in accordance with
the invention, are known compounds, e.g. from EP 5129 and
EP 124495 and can be produced by known processes. From US
5093342 it is also known that omeprazole can be used in
the treatment of Helicobacter infections. Further it has
earlier been proposed in WO 92/04898 to use a specific
antibiotic, amoxycillin, which is stable in gastric
acid, in combination with pantoprazole in the treatment of
duodenal ulcers. No specific test data are included in
said document. It has also been described earlier by the Applicant to use
amoxycillin in combination with omeprazole in the treatment of duodenal ulcers.From e.g. Science, March 22, 1946, p. 359-361 it is known
that if acid degradable penicillins are administered
orally they will be destroyed by the acid content in
