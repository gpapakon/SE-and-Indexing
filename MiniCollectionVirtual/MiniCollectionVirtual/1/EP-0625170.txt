<DESCRIPTION>
«DECORATIVE FLOOR COVERINGS HAVING THE APPEARANCEOF CERAMIC TILE AND COMPOSITIONS AND METHODSFOR MAKING SAME5 The present invention relates to decorative surface coverings. More particularly, this invention provides resilient, wear resistant polymer products having unique appearance with thorough decoration and improved aesthetic properties, and compositions and methods for making such 10 products.Wear resistant synthetic resins have been used in sheet, film or tile form for many purposes. For example, such materials have found widespread use as surface coverings, and particularly as resilient flooring. Compared to other types 15 of floor covering materials, synthetic resins possess many advantages. For example, resilient floor coverings formed of synthetic resin are generally easier to install and are more comfortable to walk on than, for example, ceramic tile.Despite its advantages, flexible resinous floor 20 covering has nevertheless failed to provide the aesthetic appeal of some of the more earthy materials, such as ceramic tile. It is well known that the appearance of surface coverings frequently has a major impact on the commercial success of such products. Thus, while resilient, plastic * 25 flooring generally performs as well as or better than other types of flooring products in terms of wear and feel, it has '* frequently been less than satisfactory in terms of its aesthetic appeal.Many techniques and processes have been suggested 30 for the manufacture of resilient, plastic flooring material 

having improved aesthetic qualities. For example, it is known to incorporate relatively small particles, chips or flakes in decorative plastic sheet materials in order to provide enhanced appearance to the resulting product, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,126,727 - Kaminski.The use of chips or particles embedded in sheet material has also been suggested for the purpose of providing non-slip plastic floor coverings, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,501,783 - Hiragami et al. This patent describes a plastic flooring material comprising a poly(vinyl chloride) matrix layer having dispersed therein from about 3% to about 30% of resin particles such as poly(methyl methacrylate) and similar acrylic resins. Hiragami et al. require that the resin particles have a softening point higher than the processing temperature of the composition which forms the matrix layer, as well as higher abrasion-resistance than the matrix layer. The patent discloses processing temperatures which are said to be at least about 20C°
