<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus and method for auto-self testing of a power converter and motor system wherein the power converter has three parallel legs, each including two series connected gate-turn-off thyristors (GTO) connected between a pair of DC power source buses. A microprocessor controls the test sequence in which each GTO is individually turned on in a predetermined order so as to create a transient snubber current through the motor and through each GTO when it is turned on. The snubber current and a voltage in each leg is measured and compared to a respective reference to detect wiring errors, and defects in the motor, the GTOs, and other system components. Error messages are generated in response to detection of abnormalities or defects.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTO SELF TEST OF AC MOTOR 8YSTEMThis Application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application S.N. 07/630,681 filed December 20, 1990 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for testing AC motor power systems and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for nondestructive in-circuit testing for short-circuit conditions in an inverter power circuit.It is common in AC electric motor drive systems to employ power inverter systems to furnish electric power from a DC source to an AC motor. These inverter systems are of various types, but are often comprised of gate turn-off thyristors (GTO) in a bridge arrangement. The GTOs in the bridge are selectively gated to control the electrical power supplied to the motor by converting DC power from the DC source into AC power which drives the motor. Typically, two GTOs are connected in a series arrangement in what is commonly referred to as a "leg" between relatively positive and relativelySUBSTITUTE SHEET 

negative busses of the DC source. A common converter of this type is a three-phase converter having three legs connected in mutual parallel between the positive and negative DC source busses. The GTOs of each of the legs are rendered conductive in a predetermined order or sequence in order to control the electrical power delivered from the DC busses to the AC motor.The above described motor systems require regular maintenance to avoid or detect a variety of common failure modes. For example, if both GTOs of a leg were to become conductive simultaneously, there would exist a short between the DC source busses which, if allowed to continue, could result in great damage to the motor, power source, and/or to the GTOs. In addition, failure of various components and segments of the system such as the feedback circuits, drive circuits, and the motor load itself can occur. In prior art, expensive and time consuming manual off-line testing has been necessary to detect many errors at an early enough stage to ensure proper operation. In order to enhance maintenance of such systems, it would accordingly be highly desirable to provide an auto self test capability and, in particular, to provide a test capability to identify short-circuit conditions prior to initiating operation of an inverter.The above as well as other desirable features are achieved in accordance with the present invention by testing a power inverter prior to enabling inverter operation.
