<ABSTRACT>
The electrode-less high pressure discharge lamp has a lamp vessel (1) 
which is surrounded by an electric coil (2). A zero-conductor (5) and a phase-conductor 

(6) extend away from the coil to be connected to a power-supply. The conductors (5, 6) 
are connected to a heat-sink (7). The phase-conductor (6) is insulated from the heat-sink 

(7) by aluminium nitride (8). The phase-conductor, and thereby the coil (2), is cooled 
by heat transfer to the aluminium nitride (8) and from there to the surroundings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a electrodeless high-pressure discharge lamp 
comprising: 
a light-transmitting lamp vessel which is closed in a vacuumtight manner 
and which has a ionizable filling; around the lamp vessel, an electric coil with end portions which are 
electrically connected to a neutral electric lead extending away from the coil and to a 
live electric lead, respectively, which leads are to be connected to an electric supply, the electric leads being connected to a heat sink. Such an electrodeless high-pressure discharge lamp is known from 
EP-A-0,440,381. Heat generated by current passage through the electric leads or through 
the coil and heat radiated by the discharge vessel towards the coil render it necessary to 
cool the leads so as to prevent the supply assuming a too high temperature. The coil 
should also be prevented from assuming a comparatively high temperature, and thus a 
comparatively high electrical resistance. A higher electrical resistance would cause the 
ohmic losses to increase, and thus also the temperature. 
In the known lamp, cooling is realised in that a heat sink is fastened against each of the 
two electric leads. Heat is thus removed from these leads through the heat sinks to the 
surroundings. Metals are highly suitable, being good thermal conductors, for forming 
heat sinks and any fins thereof. Since only one of the two electric leads can be 
connected to earth, while the other one is live, the heat sink of this other electric lead is 
live. This is a safety hazard of the known lamp. In the known lamp, a dielectric is accommodated between the electric 
leads so as to form a capacitance Cp in parallel to the coil. Dielectrics which can be 
used are polytetrafluoroethene, mica and polyimide. The said capacitance Cp renders it  
 
possible in conjunction with another capacitance Cs connected in series with the coil 
elsewhere to adapt the impedance of the load, consisting of the coil and the discharge, 
to the electric supply. A similar electrodeless high-pressure discharge lamp is also known from 
US-A-5,030,889. US-A-5,039,903 and US-A-5,042,139 disclose electrodeless high-pressure 
discharge lamps in which each of the ends of the electric coil is connected to a ballast 
via a respective heat sink, and the electric leads extend at a distance from these heat 
sinks. It is also possible to circulate water through the coils in these lamps in order to 
cool the coils. A drawback of this is that lines, a drive and energy consumption are 
necessary for this purpose.
