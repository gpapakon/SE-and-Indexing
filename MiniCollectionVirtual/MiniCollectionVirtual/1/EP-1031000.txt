<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for combustion of fuels of any specific state of aggregation which are burnt with air and water is possibly added. The invention also relates to a reactor for said method, designed to optimise the combustion process. Solid, liquid and/or gaseous fuel, possibly water and/or an oxidizing agent are conducted by means of compressed air into a reaction chamber (2) in an axial direction, whereby the amount of compressed air thus injected corresponds to the amount of air required for full combustion and the mixture introduced by means of a nozzle is conducted to a deflecting surface(7) in the inner area of the reaction chamber (2), whereupon it is atomized, sublimated and/or vaporized and burnt in an explosive manner before it can reach the wall or the bottom of the reaction chamber (2). The reactor (1) for this combustion method has a hyperbolic reactor head (3) which is connected to the outlet opening (4) of the reaction chamber (2) and which extends therefrom with an expanded cross-section, giving the reactor (1) a nozzle shape.

Method for the combustion of fuels, in which the fuels
are introduced into a reaction chamber (2) in its axial

direction by means of pressurized air and burnt, possibly
with the addition of water,

   
characterized in that
(a) a solid and/or liquid and/or gaseous fuel are used,
possibly with the addition of an oxidizing agent,
(b) the amount of injected pressurized air corresponds
to the amount of air required for the complete combustion,

and
(c) the introduced mixture is led to a deflection
surface in the interior of the reaction chamber (2), whereby

it is distributed, liquid and/or solid components are further
atomized, liquid components evaporate, solid ones sublimate

and the mixture burns explosively, before it car. reach the
wall or the bottom of the reaction chamber (2).
Method of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pressurized
air flow or the pressurized air flows are injected into the

reaction chamber (2) at a pressure of about 2 to 10 bar,
preferably at 3 to 5 bar.
Method of one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that

the inflow velocities into the reaction chamber (2) are
adjusted so that the combustion flame leaves the reaction

chamber (2) at least with the velocity of sound at a
predetermined geometry of the reaction chamber.
Method of one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

the interior space of the reaction chamber (2) is formed 
fluid dynamically by inserts introduceable into the reaction

chamber.
Method of one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

the hydrocarbons containing fluid is catalytically cracked in
the combustion.
Reactor for a combustion method, in which fuels are
burnt together with air, possibly with the addition of water

and/or an oxidizing agent, said reactor having a reaction
chamber with supply openings for the'fuel, the air, the

oxidizing agent and/or the water and with an outlet opening
for the combustion products, 
characterized in that
 the
reactor (1) has a hyperboloidal reactor head (3), which is

disposed adjacent to the outlet opening (4) of the reaction
chamber (2) and the cross-section of which widens from there,

and that a deflection surface (7) is disposed in the interior
of the reaction chamber (2) in the influx direction given by

the supply openings.
Reactor of claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the reaction
chamber (2) tapers at least at the upper part in the

direction of the outlet opening (4).
Reactor of claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the tapered
part of the reaction chamber (2) is formed as a frustrum of a

pyramid or a cone.
Reactor of claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the reaction
chamber (2) is formed hyperboloidally. 
Reactor of one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterized in that

the openings of the supply leads (5, 6) are embedded in the
bottom of the reaction chamber (2) and are directed parallel

to the axis of the reaction chamber (2).
Reactor of one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterized in that

the deflection surface (7) is formed by a cone or pyramid,
the tip of which points in the direction of the supply

openings.
Reactor of one of claims 6 to 11, 
characterized in that

a metal catalyst is provided in the interior of the reaction
chamber (2), for example in the reaction chamber walls, in

fire-resistant inserts in the interior of the reaction
chamber (2) or in the deflection surface (7).
