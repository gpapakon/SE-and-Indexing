<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED PROCESSFORMETHYLALCOHOLField of the InventionThe present invention relates to an improved method of producing methyl alcohol (methanol) from methane using two reaction steps operated in tandem. In the first reaction step two chemical reactions occur simultaneously: a) perchloroethylene (CC12CC12) is oxychlorinated with hydrogen chloride and oxygen to obtain hexachlorethane(CCI3CCI3) and water, and b) methyl chloride (CH3C1) is hydrolyzed with water to give methyl alcohol and hydrogen chloride. In the second reaction step methane is chlorinated with hexachlorethane to produce methyl chloride, hydrogen chloride and perchloroethylene. By recycling the methyl chloride, hydrogen chloride, and regenerated perchloroethylene produced in the second step to the first step the process can be operated in a balanced mode whereby the internal consumption of hydrogen chloride is equal to its formation. The process has the distinct advantage of providing high yields of product and offering significant cost savings over existing technology.Background of the InventionA process for the manufacture of methyl alcohol is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,990,696. The patent discloses a process involving three reaction steps operated in conjunction with each other. Beginning with the first step, perchloroethylene is oxychlorinated with hydrogen 

chloride and oxygen to obtain hexachloroethane. In the second step methane is chlorinated with hexachloroethane to produce methyl chloride, hydrogen chloride and regenerated perchloroethylene. The methyl chloride from the second step is isolated and hydrolyzed with water in the third step to give methyl alcohol and hydrogen chloride. The reactions are operated in a balanced mode by recycling perchloroethylene from the second step to the first step, and by recycling hydrogen chloride produced in each of the second and third steps to the first step.A number of difficulties, however, are encountered with existing technology. Perhaps the greatest shortcoming is the unfavorable equilibrium in the hydrolysis reaction of methyl chloride with water to produce methyl alcohol. At ambient temperatures the reverse reaction, namely, the formation of methyl chloride from methyl alcohol and hydrogen chloride, is greatly favored. Elevated temperatures are required to shift the equilibrium, but even then only partial conversions are possible. Thus, an excess of water or steam is favored, and unreacted methyl chloride must be recycled to the hydrolysis reaction.An additional problem identified

Claims 1. A process for the production of methyl alcohol from methane comprising the following steps operated in tandem: first, reacting methyl chloride, hydrogen chloride, perchloroethylene and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst to give reaction products comprising methyl alcohol and hexachloroethane; separating the methyl alcohol product from the hexachloroethane; and second, reacting the isolated hexachloroethane from the first step with methane to produce methyl chloride, hydrogen chloride and perchloroethylene, which are separated from any unreacted methane before being recycled to the first step.
2. A process according to claim 1 in which the source of oxygen for the first step is air.
3. A process according to claim 1 in which the catalyst used in the first step comprises copper chloride.
4. A process according to claim 3 where the catalyst comprises an admixture of copper chloride with a salt selected from the group consisting of potassium chloride, ferric chloride, lead chloride, zinc chloride, and bismuth chloride.
5. A process according to claim 1 in which the 


catalytic reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range from about 200째C to about 375째C.
