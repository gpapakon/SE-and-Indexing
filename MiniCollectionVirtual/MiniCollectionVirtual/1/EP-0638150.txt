A pilot valve as claimed in claim 11,
characterised
 in that the pilot member (14) is 
pressure-balanced. 
A pilot valve as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,
characterised
 in that a preferably cylindrical 
part (47), interacting with the pilot member (14), is 

provided, the end surface of which may be subjected to the 
pressure prevailing in the pilot chamber (23). 
A pilot valve as claimed in claim 1,
characterised
 in that the electromechanical
