<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to power
amplifiers particularly adapted to provide modulation
for an output stage of an AM RF amplifier. More
particularly, the invention relates to a power
amplifier including multiple stages for selectively
coupling power from a DC power supply to a load,
wherein responses from the multiple stages are summed
together and the number of stages that couple power to
the load is determined by the amplitude of a signal
source.Power amplifiers of the pulse width modulated type
are frequently used to provide modulating inputs to an
output electrode of an output stage of a high power AM,
RF transmitter. Some of the prior art technologies for
supplying a modulating input to an output stage of a
high power AM RF amplifier are Class B push-pull
amplifiers and Class D pulse width modulation
amplifiers. Exemplary of prior art patents disclosing
such modulation sources are Hulsey et al., United
States Patents 4,747,161 and 4,776,036, Weaver,
4,896,372, as well as Cummings 4,140,980, Swanson
3,506,920 and Swanson 3,588,744. In these prior art
devices, the modulating waveform controls the voltage
supplied to the anode, i.e., plate, or output 
electrode, of a power transmitting tube. Basically,
the plate DC power supply voltage of the output tube is
varied in response to an analog modulation source.Typically, pulse width modulated, Class D
amplifiers produce varying output signals by changing
the on and off times, i.e., duty cycle and frequency,
of a switch connected between a DC power supply and the
plate of the output stage. In some instances, the
amplitude, as well as duration, of current and voltage
fed by the switched supply to the output stage is
varied. The variable duration current pulses are
coupled to the anode of the output stage via a low pass
filter, to substantially reconstruct the original
analog input signal to the power amplifier.To obviate the disadvantages associated with high
voltage switching, e.g., 30,000 volts, some power
amplifiers use multiple pulse width modulation stages
controlled by phase displaced pulses having the same
duty cycle; see, e.g., U.S. Patents Swanson 4,468,626,
Swanson 4,164,714 and Kyrian et al 4,369,409. In these
modulators, referred to in the art as polyphase pulse
width modulators, the stages are switched at the same
frequency, but with relative phase differences. The
power fed through the multiple stages is summed.A disadvantage of the polyphase pulse width
modulation arrangement is that usually all of the
stages are being switched
