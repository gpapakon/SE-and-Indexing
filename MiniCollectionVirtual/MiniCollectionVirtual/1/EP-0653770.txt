<ABSTRACT>
A rocker switch assembly, typically for a heater, 
has a mounting box (14) for a rocker switch (3) which 

has a pivoted mount (15, 17) for an enlarged rocker 
cap (16) to enhance the look and feel of the switch. 

The cap (16) may be used as an annunciator light (22) 
shutter, may have tabs (19) for coupling adjacent 

switches to act in unison and may be acted upon by an 
automatic gravity operated safety mechanism (24, 26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to rocker switch 
assemblies. Rocker switches are used as electrical 
toggle switches in industry, domestically and in 
automobiles, for example. Because of their wide 
application and large scale manufacture the unit price 
of rocker switches is relatively low. There are 
applications in which it is useful to take advantage 
of the low unit cost of rocker switches but where it 
is desirable to enhance them. Their use in domestic 
electric convector heaters is one example. It is usual to provide a bank of switches in a 
convector heater to allow different options to be 
selected. For example, there may be an on/off switch; 
a fan switch; a 1 kW switch and a 2 kW switch. It is 
desirable to enhance the look, feel and operational 
effect of such rocker switches and this is an object 
of one embodiment of the invention. According to the invention there is provided a 
rocker switch assembly comprising a rocker switch 
having a rocker and a rocker axis about which the 
rocker pivots in operation; a base; switch mounting 
means on the base for mounting the rocker switch; a 
rocker operating cap which overlies and extends beyond 
the rocker; and a cap pivot arrangement whereby the 
cap is mounted on the base to pivot about a cap axis 
substantially in line with the rocker axis. With this 
arrangement the cap can effectively extend the size of 
the rocker and be attractively moulded and coloured. 
It may be transparent and illuminated from below. Preferably the base has a flat region and the 
switch mounting means comprises a pair of parallel 
walls upstanding from the flat region, the rocker 
switch being accommodated as a push fit between the  
 
walls and the cap pivot arrangement comprises a pair 
of spigots aligned with the rocker axis and a pair of 
notches which accommodate the spigots. Alternative arrangements are envisaged. It is 
possible to arrange for the spigots to be on the cap 
and inwardly facing to be held under a lip of the 
rocker switch, the notches then being in the walls. 
Preferably, however, the spigots are on the walls and 
the notches are in the cap. Preferably end walls link the ends of the said 
parallel walls to define an open-topped box which 
accommodates the rocker switch as a push fit. The 
base may have one or more apertures at the bottom of 
the box to allow at least terminals of the switch to 
be pushed through. In a bank of switches it is useful to indicate 
those switches which are active in such a bank and it 
has been proposed to provide annunciator

A rocker switch assembly comprising a rocker 
switch having a rocker and a rocker axis about which 

the rocker pivots in operation; a base; switch 
mounting meals on the base for mounting the rocker 

switch; a rocker operating cap which overlies and 
extends beyond the rocker; and a cap pivot arrangement 

whereby the cap is mounted on the base to pivot about 
a cap axis substantially in line with the rocker axis. 
A rocker switch assembly as claimed in Claim 1 
wherein the base has a flat region and the switch 

mounting means comprises a pair of parallel walls 
upstanding from the flat region, the rocker switch 

being accommodated as a push fit between the walls and 
the cap pivot arrangement comprises a pair of spigots 

aligned with the rocker axis and a pair of notches 
which accommodate the spigots. 
A rocker switch assembly as claimed in Claim 2 
wherein the spigots are on the walls and the notches 

are in the cap. 
A rocker switch assembly as claimed in Claim 2 or 
Claim 3 wherein end walls lin
k the ends of the said 
parallel walls to define an open-topped box which 

accommodates the rocker switch as a push fit. 
A rocker switch assembly as claimed in Claim 4 
wherein the base has one or more apertures at the 

bottom of the box to allow at least terminals of the 
switch to be pushed through. 
A rocker switch system comprising a plurality of 
 

rocker switch assemblies as claimed in any of the 
preceding claims mounted side by side on a common 

base, each with a rocker operating cap and an 
annunciator light system for indicating which of the 

switches is on, the annunciator light system 
comprising a light channel including a light source 

and, for each switch, an aperture in the channel 
adjacent the respective switch cap, the aperture being 

obscured by the cap when the switch is in the off 
position and being revealed to show an annunciator 

light when the switch is in the on position. 
A rocker switch system as claimed in Claim 6 or 
comprising a pair of rocker switch assemblies as claim 

in any of Claims 1 to 5 mounted side by side on a 
common base, the rocker caps having a coupling tab 

arrangement whereby a tap on one cap co-operates with 
the adjacent cap to ensure that one switch is switched 

on or off by switching the other switch on or off. 
A rocker switch system or assembly as claimed in 
any of the preceding claims incorporated in an 

electric heater. 
A rocker switch system or assembly as claimed in 
Claim 8 wherein the heater has a free-standing casing 

and one of the rocker switches is an on-off switch for 
the heater, there being provided a gravity operated 

linkage for the said on-off switch which mechanically 
couples the rocker cap for that switch with a pivoted 

plumb bob whereby tilting of the casing beyond 
predetermined limits causes the on-off switch to be 

automatically switched off.
