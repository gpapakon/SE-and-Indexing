<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of wax crystal modifying additives in oils obtained
from animal or vegetable material or both, or derivatives thereof.Oils obtained from animal or vegetable material are mainly metabolites comprising
trigylcerides from monocarboxylic acids, e.g. acids containing 10-25 carbon atoms
and of the form:

where R is an aliphatic radical of 10-25 carbon atoms which may be saturated or
unsaturated.Generally, such oils contain glycerides of a number of acids, the number and kind
varying with the source of the oil, and may additionally contain phosphoglycerides.
Such oils may be obtained by methods known in the art.Examples of derivatives of such oils are alkyl esters, such as methyl esters, of
fatty acids of the vegetable or animal oils. Such esters can be made by
transesterification.Reference within this specification to oils that are derived from animal or
vegetable material therefore includes reference both to oils obtained from said
animal or vegetable material or both, or to derivatives thereof.US Patent No. 2,610,915 describes glyceride oils to which are added, before or
after winterisation, a small amount of an oil-soluble polymerisation product of
esters having vinyl or substituted vinyl group, according to the general formula:
 
wherein X is a hydrogen atom and alkyl or aromatic hydrocarbon group, and Y is
-C-CO-R or -COOR in which R is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical or an
ether derivative thereof containing more than 4 carbon atoms.Fr-A-2,492,402 describes fuel compositions containing one or more fatty acid
esters of animal and vegetable origin described by the general formula:
R1-COO-R2
where R1 contain 5 to 23 carbon atoms, being a substantially linear saturated or
unsaturated aliphatic radical and R2 contains 1 to 12 carbon atoms, being a linear
or branched, saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic radical. Such fuel 
compositions are described as particularly suitable for use in diesel engines,
possessing a cetane-index range broadly equivalent to that of conventional diesel
fuels derived from mineral oils.However the usefulness of such fatty acid ester compositions as diesel fuels is
limited by their low temperature properties. DE-A-4,040,317 discloses that at
temperatures below -5°C, such fuels may solidify in supply lines due to inadequate
filterability, and describes a process for improving the low temperature filterability
involving the addition of mixtures of short chain methyl esters of fatty acids and
selected polymeric materials, namely polymeric esters or
