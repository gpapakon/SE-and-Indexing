<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a shed formation 
device for use in weaving. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to a shed formation device which is 
particularly useful in weaving narrow strips of fabric. Most 
particularly, the present invention relates to a shed forming 
device which is useful in an automatic seaming apparatus which 
is used to join the fabric ends to render the fabric endless. It is known to join woven fabrics in order to render them 
endless. Likewise, it is known to join the ends of a woven 
fabric through a process of reweaving. In the known processes, 
the ends of the fabric to be joined are processed so as to 
produce a yarn fringe which is comprised of yarns from the fabric 
body. The fringe yarns from each end are then interwoven, 
generally in the same repeat pattern as the remainder of the 
fabric, with a system of yarns selected in accordance with the 
original yarns that were interwoven with the fringe. Through 
this reweaving process, the resulting fabric is endless and has 
the same general construction throughout its length. In the prior art, it is been known to join the fabrics 
through manual procedures, semiautomatic procedures and automatic 
procedures. In connection with forming the weaving shed, 
standard loom harnesses, dobby movements and a Jacquard movement 
have been utilized to form the shed. Although the semiautomatic 
and automatic devices of the prior art have produced some 
improvement over the manual procedure, the prior art devices 
exhibit three principal flaws. One, the shed formation devices 
do not easily accommodate changes in the weave pattern. Two, the 
join speed of the prior art devices is limited by the speed of 
the shed formation. Three, the need for mechanical  
 
interconnection, generally, means that the shed formation control 
device and the actual shed formation apparatus must be positioned 
close to each other. One prior art device is disclosed in EP-A-0107099. This 
reference teaches a shed forming device with individual 
electromagnetic heddle controls which is adapted for use in 
existing looms. The device utilizes catches which cooperate with 
two reciprocating knives to form a shed. Documents DE-A-3524569 
and DE-A-406187 show additional shed forming devices with 
electromagnetoic heddle controllers which also utilize 
reciprocating lifting means or knives to effectuate movement of 
the heddles. It is the object of the present invention to provide a shed 
formation apparatus that can easily accommodate a

<CLAIMS>
A shed formation apparatus (10) having a plurality of 
movable heddles (42), a plurality of heddle selectors (80) 

connected to the movable heddles (42), a plurality of heddle 
selector controllers (60) which include stopper means (68) for 

retarding the movement of the heddle selectors (80), a first 
plurality of control leads (50) connecting the heddle selectors 

(80) to the heddles (42), repeat pattern output means that 
selectively activates the stopper means (68) in accordance with 

a shedding repeat pattern, and a second plurality of control 
leads (84) attached to the heddle selectors (80), wherein the 

improvement is characterized by: 

a first harness means (32, 34) which increases the spacing 
between the first plurality of control leads (50); [and]
 
a second harness means (36, 38) which is separated from the 
first harness means (32, 34) by the heddle selectors (60) and 

decreases the spacing between the second plurality of control 
leads (84); and 
a moveable plate (40) having a plurality of apertures (86), 
through which the second plurality of control leads (84) pass 

prior to terminating, the plate (40) is moved in accordance with 
the repeat pattern output means, movement of the plate (40) from 

an initial rest position to a second position causes movement of 
the heddles (42) from the rest position and, after activation of 

the stopper means (68) in accordance with a shedding repeat 
pattern, the moveable plate (40) moves toward its initial 

position and causes the non-selected control leads and their 
associated heddles (42) to return toward their initial position 

to form the shed opening in accordance with the repeat pattern. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein each heddle selector 
(80) is associated with a respective heddle (42). 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the stopper means (68) 
is located between the first and second harness means.  

 
A method for forming a shed opening in an array of 
yarns including: providing a shed formation apparatus (10) having 

a plurality of movable heddles (42), a plurality of heddle 
selectors (80) connected to the movable heddles (42), a plurality 

of heddle selector controllers (60) which include stopper means 
(68) for retarding the movement of the heddle selectors (80), a 

first plurality of control leads (50) connecting the heddle 
selectors (80) to the heddles (42), repeat pattern output means 

that selectively activates the stopper means (68) in accordance 
with a shedding repeat pattern, and a second plurality of control 

leads (84) attached to the heddle selectors (80); 

moving [all] the heddle selectors (80), and therefore their 

associated heddles (42) and yarns (12) from their initial 
position to a second position; 
selectively activating the stopper means (68) in selected 
controllers (60) in accordance with the repeat pattern output 

means to retard the movement of the selected heddle selectors 
(80), and therefore their associated heddles (42) and yarns (12), 

from the second position; and 
moving the non-selected heddle selectors (80), and 
therefore their associated heddles (42) and yarns (12) back to 

the initial position such that the shed opening is formed between 
the yarns (12) in the respective positions, wherein the improved 

method is characterized by: 
providing a moveable plate (40) through which the second 
plurality of control leads (84) pass prior to terminating that 

is controlled by the repeat pattern output means; 
moving the plate (40), and therefore the second plurality 
of control leads (84) to move all the heddle selectors (80) from 

their initial resting position to a second position; and 
moving the plate (40) to its initial position after the 
selected controllers (60) have been activated to retard the 

movement of the selected heddle selectors (80) in accordance with 
the repeat pattern 
output means such that non-selected heddle 
selectors (80) and their associated heddles (42) and yarns (12) 

move back to their initial resting position to form the shed 
opening. 
The method of claim 4 wherein the initial heddle (42) 
position is the rest position.
