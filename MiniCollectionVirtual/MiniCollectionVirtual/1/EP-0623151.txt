<ABSTRACT>
A one-part, photoactivatable, thermally curable epoxy composition containing epoxide; photoactive organometallic complex salt; polyol(s); and a non-reactive toughening agent. The inventive epoxy compositions exhibit superior pot-life before photoactivation of the organometallic complex salt catalyst and superior latency afterwards before curing of the photoactivated epoxy composition to an adhesive state by heat. The resulting adhesive is particularly useful for bonding plastics or metals to steel surfaces such as oiled, galvanized steel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a one-part, photoactivatable, thermally curable epoxy 
composition. This invention also relates to an epoxy adhesive made from the 
inventive photoactivatable, thermally curable epoxy composition. Epoxides, i.e., organic compounds having one or more terminal or pendant 
oxirane (epoxy) groups, have been widely used for many years in adhesive 
compositions. These compounds are commonly cured, or caused to harden, by the 
addition of a curing or hardening agent. Many epoxy compositions use curing agents 
that begin to react immediately, or after a short period of time, even at room 
temperature or lower. These two-part adhesive compositions require that the epoxide 
and the curing agent be stored separately and only mixed immediately before use. 
Various attempts have been made to prolong "pot life" prior to cure of curable epoxy 
compositions. This allows the epoxide and curing agent to be mixed and stored 
before use as a one-part adhesive that is curable upon heating. Generally, it has been 
found that any increase in pot-life of epoxy compositions results in a corresponding 
sacrifice of cure speed. Additionally, achieving complete reaction, i.e., where all the 
epoxide functional groups are consumed, may require longer cure times and/or higher 
cure temperatures. The preferred curing agents, Lewis acids, cannot be used where 
appreciable pot-life of the composition is desired. Because of the high affinity of the 
Lewis acid with the oxygen atom of the oxirane ring, almost immediate curing of the 
epoxy resin takes place. Modification of the Lewis acids utilized has been attempted 
in order to prolong the pot-life of epoxy resins. One method of accomplishing this 
result has been to complex the Lewis acid with a nucleophilic reagent such as an 
ether, an alcohol, amine, or the like. As with the above disclosed two-part epoxy 
adhesive compositions, however, such one-part compositions have also been found 
to sacrifice cure time and/or performance characteristics of the resulting cured resin. Various items disclosing the preparation and/or use of curing agents for epoxy 
resins and/or other curable compositions are discussed below.  
 US-A-4,404,355 (Eldin et al.) discloses the use of copper complex co-catalyzed 
onium salts as photoinitiators for epoxy resins. Such a catalyst system will 
cause gelation within several minutes at 120°C, yet allows good pot-life at 40°C. 
Achieving extended pot-life over a period of several months, however, is not possible 
with such a catalyst
