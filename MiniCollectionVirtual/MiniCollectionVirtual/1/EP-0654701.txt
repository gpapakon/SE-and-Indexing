<ABSTRACT>
An improved stereoscopic picture, comprising: 
(a) a lenticular faceplate material having a 

predetermined number of lenticules, the lenticules 
having a given pitch and a given subtended primary 

angle; and (b) a photographic receiver mounted on the 
lenticular faceplate material and on which are recorded 

sets of right and left perspective views of a first 
pair of stereoscopic pictures, the lenticular faceplate 

material and the photographic receiver being aligned so 
that each set on the photographic receiver corresponds 

to an associated given lenticule of the lenticular 
faceplate material, the width of the sets of right and 

left perspective views being less than the pitch of the 
lenticules.

This application is related to: 
US Application No 722,713 filed on June 27, 
1991 in the name of Chase and Taylor and entitled 
"Electronically interpolated integral photographic 
system"; US Application No 885,217 filed on May 19, 
1992 in the name of Syracuse, Kent and Taylor and 
entitled "Method and Apparatus for improving electronic 
recording of depth images"; US Application No 974,441 filed on November 
12, 1992 in the name of Taylor and entitled "CRT 
printer for lenticular photographs"; and US Application No 885,699 filed on May 19, 
1992 in the name of Taylor and Fogel and entitled 
"Electronically printed depth photography system with 
improved viewing range;  
   all incorporated by reference herein. The invention relates to the field of 
stereoscopic photographs and more particularly to a 
stereoscopic picture having an improved arrangement of 
the left and right perspective views for convenient and 
unambiguous viewing of stereo pairs printed on a 
photographic receiver (film or paper) and aligned with 
a lenticular faceplate for display. The invention 
relates also to a method for producing such a 
stereoscopic photograph.  Three-dimensional photography is 
comprehensively described in Three-Dimensional Imaging 
Techniques by Takanori Okoshi (New York: Academic 
Press, 1976, translated from the Japanese edition 
published in 1972) which provides a basis for 
describing the attributes and advantages of this 
invention. Okoshi initially distinguishes between 
truly three dimensional imaging and stereoscopic 
imaging on the basis of the amount of information 
involved. The quantity of information for a 
stereoscopic (or binocular) image is only twice that of 
a planar (one-dimensional) image, while much greater 
information is present for a truly three-dimensional 
image (which is often called an autostereoscopic 
image). Images of the latter type are truly spatial 
images that gradually show more of the right side of 
the object when the observer moves rightward, and more 
of the left side of the object when the observer moves 
leftward (which is often referred to as a "look around" 
capability). Integral photography is a method of 
recording a complete spatial image, that is, one 
viewable from a multiplicity of directions, upon a 
single flat photographic plate. The principles of 
integral photography were described by G. Lippman in 
1908 in a paper read to the French Academy of Science. 
Integral photography thus has a long history of 
theoretical consideration and demonstration, but

predetermined number of lenticules, said lenticules 

having a given pitch and a given subtended primary 
angle; and 
(b) a photographic receiver mounted on said 
lenticular faceplate material and on which are recorded 

sets of right and left perspective views of a first 
pair of stereoscopic pictures,said sets of right and 

left perspective views being of a given width, said 
lenticular faceplate material and said photographic 

receiver being aligned so that each set on said
