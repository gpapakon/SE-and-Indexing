<ABSTRACT>
A method of minimizing particle or residue accumulation within an
exhaust line of a substrate processing chamber (15) having a downstream plasma

apparatus (100) connected to the exhaust line (60). One embodiment of the method turns
ON the downstream plasma apparatus during a substrate deposition step and a chamber

clean operation, and switches the downstream plasma apparatus OFF at other times
including the time during which purge gases are flowed into the chamber and various

chamber set up or conditioning steps are performed. The method includes depositing a
film over a substrate disposed in the substrate processing chamber by (i) flowing a

deposition gas into the substrate processing chamber (15), exhausting at least some of the
deposition gas from the processing chamber through an exhaust line and into the

downstream plasma apparatus, and forming a plasma within the downstream plasma
apparatus; and then (ii) stopping the flow of the deposition gas, turning the plasma OFF,

and flowing a purge gas into the substrate processing chamber. After one or more film
deposition steps, the chamber is cleaned to remove film deposition from the interior

surfaces of the chamber by (i) flowing an etchant into the substrate processing chamber,
exhausting the etchant from the substrate processing chamber through an exhaust line and

into the downstream plasma apparatus, and forming a plasma within the downstream
plasma apparatus; and then (ii) stopping the flow of the etchant, turning the plasma OFF,

and flowing a purge gas into the substrate processing chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of semiconductor
processing equipment and more specifically to a method for eliminating contaminants and
residues from inside a vacuum exhaust line connected to a processing chamber.During chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processing, deposition gases are
released inside a processing chamber to form a thin film layer on the surface of a substrate
being processed. Unwanted deposition on areas such as the walls of the processing
chamber also occurs during such CVD processes. Because the residence time in the
chamber of individual molecules in some deposition gases is relatively short, however,
only a small portion of the molecules released into the chamber are consumed in the
deposition process and deposited on either the wafer or chamber walls.The unconsumed gas molecules are pumped out of the chamber along with
partially reacted compounds and reaction byproducts through a vacuum exhaust line that
is commonly referred to as the "foreline." Many of the compounds in this exhausted gas
are still in highly reactive states and/or contain residues or particulate matter that can form
unwanted deposits in the foreline. Given time, this deposition build-up of residue and/or
particulate matter presents a problem. For example, if enough of the deposition material
builds-up in the foreline, the foreline and/or its associated vacuum pump may clog if it is
not appropriately cleaned. Even when periodically cleaned, matter build-up interferes
with normal operation of the vacuum pump and can drastically shorten the useful life of
the pump. Also, the solid matter may backwash from the foreline into the processing
chamber and contaminate processing steps adversely effecting wafer yield.As is known in the industry, it is common to remove deposition material
that builds up on the interior of chamber walls with an in situ chamber clean operation.
Common chamber cleaning techniques include the use of an etching gas, such as fluorine,
to remove the deposited material from the chamber walls and other areas. In some
processes, the etching gas is introduced into the chamber and a plasma is formed so that
the etching gas reacts with and removes the deposited material from the chamber walls. 
Such cleaning procedures are commonly performed between deposition steps for every
wafer or every n wafers.Removal of deposition material from chamber walls is relatively
straightforward in that the plasma is created within the chamber in an area proximate to
the deposited material. Removal of
