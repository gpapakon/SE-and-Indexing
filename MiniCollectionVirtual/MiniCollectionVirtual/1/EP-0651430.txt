<ABSTRACT>
Nonpolar substrates (1) comprising off-axis growth 
regions (12) for the growth of polar semiconductors, and a 

method for making such substrates, are disclosed. 
According to the invention, an erodible material (6), such as 

a photoresist, is applied to a substrate at a site and is 
exposed to radiation at that site which has an linear 

variation in energy at the surface of the erodible 
material. Due to this variation in exposure energy, a 

taper (10) results in the erodible material (6) after development. 
The tapered region is then etched in a manner which etches 

both the erodible layer (6) and the underlying substrate (1). The 
taper (10) in the erodible layer (6) provides a varying attenuation 

during the etching process such that the taper (10) of the 
erodible layer (6) is transferred to the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surface preparation of 
nonpolar wafers to facilitate epitaxial growth of polar 
semiconductors. Growing polar semiconductors, such as III-V and II-VI 
compound semiconductors, on nonpolar substrates, such as 
silicon (Si) or germanium (Ge), is desirable for the 
implementation of a variety of integrated electronic and 
optical applications. Such applications include, for 
example, optical interconnects between integrated circuit 
chips, optical computing and photonic switching. 
It is, however, difficult to grow compound semiconductors 
on nonpolar substrates. The principal reason for this 
difficulty is that there are no preferential bonding sites 
for initial growth on the nonpolar substrate for the 
cations and anions of the compound semiconductor. As a 
result, some growth may begin in the cation plane, and 
some in the anion plane. This is referred to as antiphase 
disorder. Further, differences in the lattice structure 
of certain semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs) 
and Si, for example, present an additional impediment to 
satisfactory growth. Antiphase disorder and lattice 
mismatch may result in both structural and electrically 
active defects.
 
The difficulty with growing compound semiconductors, in 
particular GaAs, on nonpolar substrates, has been 
addressed in the prior art. See Fischer et al., "Growth 
and Properties of GaAs/AlGaAs on Nonpolar Substrates Using 
Molecular Beam Epitaxy," J. Appl. Phys. 58(1) at 374-81 
(1985); Biegelsen et al., "Heteroepitaxial Growth of Polar 
Semiconductors on Non-Polar Substrates," Mat. Sci. Eng.  
 
B14(3) at 317-331 (1992); Harris et al., "The Nucleation 
and Growth of GaAs on Si," Mat. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc., 
Vol. 91 at 3-14 (1987); Tran et al., "Growth and 
Characterization of InP on Silicon by MOCVD," J. Crys. 
Grwth. 121(3) at 365-72 (1992); Sporken et al., "Molecular 
Beam Epitaxy of CdTe on Large Area Si<100>," J. Vac. Sci. 
Tech. B 9(3) at 1651-55 (1991). All articles referenced 
in this specification are incorporated herein by 
reference. One approach for growing compound semiconductors on 
nonpolar substrates is to angle or tilt the substrate off 
the standard <100> orientation. See Harris et al. The 
designation "<100>" is known as a Miller indice. It may 
be used to describe the orientation of a planar surface. 
The <100> surface refers to a surface which lies along a 
face of a cubic lattice structure, and this is the 
standard orientation for substrates such as silicon. 
However, there are problems
