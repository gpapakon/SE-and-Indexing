<ABSTRACT>
An ignition system for internal combustion engines has a clamping circuit (10, 11, 12, 16) for limiting the primary voltage and protecting high-voltage conducting parts against destruction. The ignition system has a voltage clamping device for the ignition transistor (3), and the clamping voltage is variable depending on a load on the secondary side. The primary voltage (Up) is determined by an evaluation unit (9). When the secondary laod is high, a high clamping voltage is applied, and when the secondary load is low, a low clamping voltage is applied. Moreover, the evaluation (23-28) of the primary voltage enables to diagnose defects in the ignition system.

Ignition system for internal combustion engines, 
with an ignition coil and an ignition output stage (3) in 

series with the primary winding (1) of the ignition coil, 
with a terminal circuit (10,11,12,16) which limits the 

primary current flowing in the primary winding of the 
ignition coil when a prescribable primary voltage at the 

connection (14) between the primary winding (1) and 
ignition output stage (3) is exceeded, and contains at 

least one switching element (11) with a specific breakdown 
voltage, the branch of the terminal circuit (10,11, 

12,16) which contains the switching element (11) with a 
specific breakdown voltage being led from the connection 

(14) between the primary winding (1) and ignition output 
stage (3) to the control electrode of the ignition output 

stage (3), characterized in that the terminal circuit 
(10,11,12,16) can be modified with an evaluation unit 

(9), connected between the primary winding (1) and 
ignition output stage (3), as a function of a secondary-side 

load (6,7), in such a way that the terminal circuit 
(10,11,12,16) limits the primary voltage in the case of 

a high secondary load with a high primary voltage and in 
the case of a low secondary load with a correspondingly 

low primary voltage. 
Ignition system according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the evaluation unit (9) detects the rise 

time (tr) of the primary voltage (U
p
) as a measure of the 
secondary load. 
Ignition system according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the evaluation unit (9) detects the time  

 
between the ignition time and the time when a prescribable 

threshold voltage is reached in the primary winding 
as a measure of the rise time (tr). 
Ignition system according to Claim 1, characterized 

in that, after a prescribable time after the 
ignition time, the evaluation unit (9) detects the 

voltage in the primary winding as a measure of the 
secondary load. 
Ignition system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the detected primary 

voltage (U
p
) can be compared with limit values (U
REF
) for 
spark length and/or sparking voltage profile which 

represent a correct combustion. 
Ignition system according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that, in the case of a deviation of the 

primary voltage from the limit values, a faulty combustion 
is detected and a fault display signal (27) is 

output.
