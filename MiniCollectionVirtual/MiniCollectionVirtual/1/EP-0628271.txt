<ABSTRACT>
2.1 Known assembly display cases, which comprise merely horizontal frames and vertical panels placed in grooves of the same, exhibit sufficient stability only when the panels are inserted into the grooves using great force. For the rapid and simple assembly of a display case this is too laborious. 2.2 It is proposed that the grooves be assigned resilient clamping lips which act as a type of barb when forces are exerted on the panels to be inserted which try to remove the panels from the grooves again. 2.3 use for assembly display cases in fair and exhibition construction.

Display case structure wherein at least two horizontal
frames (3), which are arranged above one another with

spacing, are provided with grooves (5, 6) which run around
the upper side and/or underside and into which sheets (4, 7)

of identical height are introduced vertically and held,
characterised in that a resilient clamping lip (9, 14, 16,

18) which protrudes, with a movable portion, into the
groove, is associated with the grooves (5) and can be

positioned against the side of the associated sheet (4), and
in that the clamping lip is attached to the upper edge

region (10a) of the groove wall (10), which edge region
(10a) is narrower than the remaining width of the groove

wall (10) and is stepped back outwards from the course of
the groove wall, the clamping lip (9, 14, 16, 18) having

static friction, hardness and resilience properties such
that, when the sheet (4) is pushed in the course of the

introduction movement, only very small forces have to be
overcome, but, when it is pulled, the movable portion of the

clamping lip is clamped against the sheet (4), which results
in secure retention of the sheet in the groove (5).
Display case structure according to claim 1, characterised
in that the edge region (10a) is stepped back from the

course of the groove wall by a slope (10b).
Display case structure according to claim 1, characterised
in that the clamping lip (9, 14, 16, 18) is formed

integrally on the edge region (10a).
Display case structure according to claim 1, characterised
in that the clamping lip (9) is in the form of a curved 

profile bent towards the associated wall (10) of the groove
(5).
Display case structure according to claim 4, characterised
in that a tangent which is located against the clamping

lip (9) in the region of the free end (9a) of the profile on
the side directed into the groove (5) extends approximately

parallel with the securing wall (10) for the clamping lip
(9).
Display case structure according to claim 1, characterized
in that the free end of the clamping lip (14) is rolled

to form a hollow profile (15).
Display case structure according to claim 1, characterized
in that a second clamping lip (19), which is attached

at a somewhat lower point on the wall (10) of the groove
(5), is associated with the first clamping lip (18).
Display case structure according to claim 7, characterised
in that both clamping lips (18, 19) have a profile

which widens in the form of a teardrop from the point of
attachment towards the free end.
Display case structure according to any one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the frames (3) and

the clamping lip (9, 14, 16, 18) comprise a plastics
material and in that an unplasticised PVC is used for the

frames (3) and a plasticised PVC for the clamping lips.
