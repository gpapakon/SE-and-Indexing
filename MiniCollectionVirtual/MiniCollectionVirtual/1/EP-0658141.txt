<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for manufacturing decorable moulded parts made of plastic materials. An extrudable thermoplastic material is injected or pressed behind a non-dried or non-cured flat decorative layer or lacquer layer. In a preferred embodiment, the decorative or lacquer layer is powder coated and the support film, the lacquer layer and the thermoplastic material are co-extruded together. This process allows decorable moulded parts having complex geometrical shapes to be manufactured.

A process for manufacturing a moulded article made of 
plastic materials provided with a dried or cured decorative 

or paint layer, characterized in that an extrudable 
thermoplastic material is injected or pressed behind the 

decorative or paint layer in the non-dried or non-cured 
state. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein 

(a) a backing film is provided with a separable decorative 
layer on the entire surface thereof or a uniform 

paint layer, 
(b) an extrudable thermoplastic material is injected or 
pressed behind the so obtained laminate without 

preliminary drying or curing the decorative layer 
or paint layer, 
(c) the moulded article thus obtained is released from 
the mould and subsequently 
(d) the backing film and the decorative layer on the 
entire surface thereof or the uniform paint layer 

are separated from one another by stripping. 
The process according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the backing film, optionally a clear paint layer, the  

 
decorative layer or paint layer, and the thermoplastic 

material are sandwiched by coextrusion. 
The process according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in 
that a backing film having a thickness of from 30 to 

200 µm, in particular 30 to 100 µm, is used. 
The process according to any one of claims 2 to 4, characterized 
in that a plastic film, in particular from 

polyester, is used as a backing film. 
The process according to any one of claims 2 to 5, characterized 
in that the decorative layer or the uniform 

paint layer on the entire surface thereof is applied on 
the backing film by roller printing or electrostatic 

powder coating. 
The process according to claim 6, characterized in that 
the powder coating is selected from thermoplastic-duroplastic 

materials, in particular from polyamides, ethylene/vinyl 
acetate copolymers, polyesters, polyepoxides, 

and mixtures thereof. 
The process according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the polyepoxides are selected from solid epoxide resins 

on the basis of bisphenol A and especially a crosslinking 
agent which is solid at room temperature, selected from 

dicyanodiamides, phenolic hardeners, imidazoles, and 
dicarboxylic acid anhydrides, in particular maleic anhydride. 
The process according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the polyesters are selected from a mixture of polyesterpoly 

(carboxylic acids) and triglycidylisocyanruates.  
 
The process according to any one of claims 2 to 9, characterized 
in that the backing film is moulded, particularly 

deep-drawn, before applying the decorative layer 
or uniform paint layer thereon. 
The process according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the pre-moulded backing film is provided with a powder 

coating by spraying. 
The process according to any one of claims 2 to 9, characterized 
in that the laminate consisting of backing film 

and decorative layer or paint layer is positioned within 
a compression mould and moulded, in particular deep-drawn, 

at elevated temperature, optionally under reduced 
pressure. 
The process according to any one of claims 2 to 9, characterized 
in that the laminate consisting of backing 

film, decorative layer or paint layer, and extrudable 
plastic is positioned within a compression mould and 

moulded, in particular deep-drawn, at elevated temperature, 
optionally under reduced pressure. 
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the plastic material is selected 

from acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymers, polycarbonates, 
and polyolefines, in particular polyethylenes, 

polypropylenes, polyvinyl compounds, polyamides, 
polyacetals, polyepoxides, polyurethanes, 

ionomers, and mixtures thereof, in particular ABS/PC 
polymers containing optionally fillers. 
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that the plastic material contains 

reinforcing materials selected from reinforcing fibers,  
 

in particular glass fibers, carbon fibers, high-resistant 
organic fibers, metal fibers, or ceramic fibers. 
The process according to any one of claims 2 to 15, 
characterized in that a clear paint layer is incorporated 

between the backing film and the decorative layer or 
paint layer. 
The process according to claim 16, characterized in that 
the clear paint layer, in particular a commercial automobile 

clear paint, has a thickness of from 10 to 50 µm. 
The process according to claim 16 or 17, characterized 
in that the backing film is provided with the clear paint 

layer by spraying, dipping, or roller printing and, 
optionally, it is dried. 
The process according to any one of claims 6 to 18, 

characterized in that adhesion promoters or reinforcing 
agents, in particular perforated screens, reinforcing 

fabrics, and/or reinforcing webs are incorporated between 
the thermoplastic material and the powder coating. 
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 19, 
characterized in that the decorative layer or paint layer 

is cured in the temperature range of from 130 to 240 °C, 
in particular 180 to 200 °C, during 0.5 to 120 min, in 

particular 1 to 30 min. 
The process according to any one of claims 6 to 20, 
characterized in that the thickness of the powder coating 

is adjusted to 0.1 to 5 mm, in particular 0.02 to 0.1 mm 
or 0.1 to 0.5 mm.  

 
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 21, 
characterized in that there are produced moulded parts 

for the interior and exterior areas of automobiles, for 
the shop-fitting and/or exhibition construction.
