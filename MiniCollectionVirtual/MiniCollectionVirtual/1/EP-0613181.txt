<ABSTRACT>
A bipolar transistor (2), comprising a collector region 
(C1), base region (B1), and emitter region (E1), is a 

compatible type to CMOS processes leading to the formation, 
on a semiconductor substrate (10), of N-channel and P-channel 

MOS transistors having respective source and drain 
regions; in such transistor the collector region (C1) is a 

substrate diffused pocket (3) and the base region (B1) is 
formed within the diffused pocket (3) simultaneously with 

the source (8) and drain (9) regions of the P-channel MOS 
transistors (7). Further, the emitter region (E1) is 

incorporated, in turn, to the base region (B1) 
simultaneously with the source and drain regions of the N-channel 

MOS transistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bipolar transistor having a 
collector region, a base region, and an emitter region, and 
being compatible to CMOS processes which lead to produce, 
on a semiconductor substrate, N-channel and P-channel MOS 
transistors having respective source and drain regions. As is well known, CMOS technology manufacturing processes 
which allow the implementation of electronic integrated 
circuits including MOS transistors, also result in 
parasitic bipolar transistors being obtained which may be 
utilized as active components in various analog and band-gap 
reference devices. The utilization of this kind of parasitic bipolar 
transistors, in combination with MOS transistors, presently 
constitutes a useful alternative to the bipolar-CMOS 
combined technology processes and is gaining increasing 
acceptance. A major advantage resides in that these devices can be 
formed without any additional masking to the basic CMOS 
processes. The currently known CMOS processes, which provide for the 
aforementioned combination of MOS and bipolar transistors, 
are of two types:
 
N-Well MOS with either NPN lateral or PNP vertical bipolar 
transistors; and,
 
P-Well MOS with either NPN lateral or NPN vertical bipolar 
transistors.  While being in many ways advantageous, these prior devices 
still have some limitations, due to the process used to 
implement them, such limitations restrict their performance 
and range of possible applications. For example, lateral transistors of the type indicated 
above, usually have a low current gain and are only 
employed in actual practice for some special applications, 
such as in protection circuits against electrostatic 
discharges. The bipolar transistors of the vertical type have, on the 
other hand, a disadvantage in that they can only operate in 
the common-collector configuration because the substrate is 
held at a fixed reference potential, at all times. Furthermore, PNP transistors implemented by N-Well CMOS 
processes -- which are the more widely used ones -- have an 
additional disadvantage in that their current gain is lower 
than that of NPN transistors which are implemented by P-Well 
CMOS processes. Lastly, the scaling of such CMOS devices involves increased 
Well pocket concentration, which is apt to further impair 
the performance of the bipolar transistors incorporated 
thereto. Thus, on the whole, the aforementioned shortcomings greatly 
restrict the performance and range of applications for 
bipolar transistors implemented in CMOS technology. The
