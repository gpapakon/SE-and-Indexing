<ABSTRACT>
A high-level-language compiler allocates memory space for parameters 
detected in a source program in descending order of size and appearance, 

thus requiring less padding to ensure correct alignment of individual 
data items than if the allocation were based solely on the order of 

appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a language
processing system and a language processing method
therefor. More specifically, the invention relates to
a language processing system and a language processing
method for coding process of a high level language as a
program language of a microprocessor.In general, a machine language program
instructing operation of the computer is described by a
string of figures, such as binary number or hexadecimal
number and so forth. Since the machine language
program described by the string of figures is too
difficult to understand, a programmer typically
prepares a program (hereinafter referred to as "source
program") by a high level language employing expression
easier for the programmer to understand and then
translates the source program into the machine language
program. Then, the machine language program is loaded
to the computer for execution. A compiler is one of a
language processing system performing this translation.In the conventional language processing, data
assignment of external parameter information is
typically performed in the order of appearance of those 
external parameter information. For instance, in the
example of a source program described by C-language
shown in Fig. 20, the external parameter information in
the program are "c1", "i", "c2", "l" in order of
appearing. Then, the data assignment is performed in
the order of "c1", "i", "c2", "l". Here, "c1" and "c2"
are external parameter information having 1 byte of
data length, "i" is external parameter information
having 2 bytes of data length and "l" is external
parameter information having 4 bytes of data length.
In Fig. 20, "char", "int", "long" are identifiers
respectively indicating attributes of data.Also, Fig. 10 is an imaginary illustration
showing manner of assignment of "c1", "i", "c2", "l" in
data regions. In Fig. 10, when "c1" is assigned to an
address from 100C, "i" is assigned to an address from
100B, "c2" is assigned to an address from 1009 and "l"
is assigned to the address from 1008.However, in certain architecture of the
computer, it is possible that the data assigned in the
odd number address cannot be accessed or that while the
data in the odd number address can be accessed, the
access speed for the data in the even number address is
higher than that in the odd number address. In such
case, in order to make all data accessible and to
speed-up access for permitting higher speed execution
of the program, a process called as "alignment" is 
performed.The alignment is a restriction
