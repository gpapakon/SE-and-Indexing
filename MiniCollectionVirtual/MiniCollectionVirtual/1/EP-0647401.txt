<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of combatting pests at
a locus and to pesticidal compositions.Insecticidal 1,2,4-triazole compounds are known and have
been extensively described in, for example, U.S. Patent
No. 4 742 072, U.S. Patent No. 3 308 131, U.S. Patent
No. 3 973 028, U.S. Patent No. 4 054 664, U.S. Patent
No. 4 160 839, U.S. Patent No. 4 220 790, European Patent
Application No. 0 213 718, European Patent Application
No. 0 337 815 and European Patent Application
No. 0 338 685.Insecticidal pyrethroid compounds are also well-known and
have been described in, for example, U.K. Patent
Application No. 1 413 491 (NRDC), European Patent
Application No. 22382 (FMC), European Patent Application
No. 107296 (ICI), U.K. Patent Application No. 1 565 932
(Bayer), U.K. Patent Application No. 1 439 615 (Sumitomo),
U.K. Patent Application No. 1 560 303 (Sumitomo), U.K.
Patent Application No. 2 013 206 (Sumitomo), and U.K.
Patent Application No. 2 064 528 (Shell).This invention is based on the discovery of a novel
pesticidal method and composition which utilises both
1,2,4-triazole compounds and pyrethroid compounds.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
there is provided a pesticidal composition which includes
a substituted 1,2,4-triazole compound and a pyrethroid
insecticide.Said triazole compound and said pyrethroid insecticide
have, surprisingly, been found to act synergistically when
used in a method of combatting pests at a locus. Preferably, the wt% of 1,2,4-triazole in said composition
is greater than the wt% of pyrethroid insecticide in said
composition. The wt% of 1,2,4-triazole in said
composition may be at least twice, is preferably at least
four times, the wt% of pyrethroid insecticide in said
composition.Generally, when any moiety described herein comprises an
alkyl group this alkyl group may be linear or branched and
may suitably contain 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 6, and most
preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, suitable examples being
methyl, ethyl, propyl and t-butyl. When any groups are
designated as being optionally substituted, the
substituent groups which are optionally present may be any
of those customarily employed in the development of
pesticidal compounds, and/or the modification of such
compounds to influence their structure/activity,
persistence, penetration or other property. In relation
to moieties which comprise an optionally substituted alkyl
or alkylene group, specific examples of such substituents
include halogen, especially fluorine, chlorine or bromine
atoms, and
