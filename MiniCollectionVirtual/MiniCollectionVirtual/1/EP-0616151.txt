Pulley, in particular for a continuously variable transmission, 
provided 

with at least two discs (21,22,23,24), which are installed on a pulley 
shaft (25,26) and are 

fixed against mutual rotation and wherein at least one of the discs 
(22,23) is 

installed so as to be axially slidable in relation to the shaft (25,26). 
The pulley is provided with compensation means (49,50) which exert a 
resultant 

eccentric, axially-directed force between the discs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pulley in particular for a continuously 
variable transmission, provided with at least two discs, which are 
primarily co-axially installed on a pulley shaft and are fixed against 
mutual rotation, wherein at least one of the discs is slidable in 
relation to the shaft by means of displacement means and wherein 
compensation means are provided to exert a resultant eccentric, 
axially-directed force between the discs. Such a pulley is known from WO-A-90/01129. Said known pulley, in 
particular the compensation means thereof, is rather cumbersome which 
makes it less suitable for applications wherein the available space is 
limited. The object of the invention is to further develop such a pulley. 
This object is achieved in that at least that 
part of the shaft lying between the point of application of the 
resultant force to be exerted by the compensation means and that disc 
that is nearest to said compensation means are made primarily 
relatively flexible. An optimal compensation effect can be realized in case the 
relatively flexible part of the shaft is thinner than the basic shaft.  
 
The slidable disc is preferably at 
least partially mounted onto the relatively flexible part of the shaft. According to another feature of the invention, a disc is supported 
on the shaft by means of a hinge, preferably a ball hinge, to support the 
operation of the compensation means. The fixed disc and the shaft can be advantageously rigidly mounted 
by providing the part of the shaft adjacent to the side of the slidable 
disc which is furthest away from the fixed disc, with at least two 
bearings. The first and the second bearings can be connected by a securable 
torsion-rigid bearing housing. According to the invention, the compensation means can be equipped 
to exert a variable resultant eccentric axially-directed force, The first 
bearing at the location of the fixed disc, possibly surrounded by the 
fixed disc, and a second bearing at a distance from the fixed disc. Because 
of this, the resultant force can be adjusted depending on the desired 
contact pressure and/or the desired point of application. According to a further elaboration of the invention, the compensation 
means comprise a power cylinder. By connecting the power cylinder 
to an operating cylinder of a moveable disc, the following is realized: 
the prevailing pressure in the power cylinder is the same as, or is a 
derivative from, the transmission ratio-dependent pressure in the operating 
cylinder, which is also a
