<ABSTRACT>
The preparation of porous ceramic bodies by 
sintering certain curable organopolysiloxanes filled with 

silicon carbide powders. This process is advantageous in 
that the green bodies have relative high strengths and thus 

can be easily handled and, if desired, machined before 
sintering.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of porous
ceramic bodies by the pyrolysis of curable organopolysiloxanes
filled with silicon carbide powders and,
optionally, organopolysiloxane curing agents and sintering
aids. This process is advantageous in that both the green
bodies and the resultant ceramics have high strengths.In the art, it is known to mold mixtures of large
particle size silicon carbide and smaller size silicon
carbide into a desired shape followed by pyrolyzing the
molded mixture to form a ceramic article. The particle size
variation in this approach creates the desired pores.
Similarly, it is known to mold a mixture comprising a
carbonaceous binder, silicon carbide powder and a silaceous
powder into the desired shape followed by pyrolysis. In this
latter approach, the carbon formed by pyrolysis of the
carbonaceous binder reacts with the silaceous binder to form
silicon carbide, thus, leaving pores in the sinter. Neither
of these approaches, however, encompasses the use of
organopolysiloxanes as binders to form porous ceramics.Suganuma et al. in the Journal of Materials
Science, 28 (1993) pp. 1175-1181, teach the formation of
porous silicon carbide bodies by pyrolyzing a mixture of SiC
powder, polysilastyrene and an organic binder. This article,
therefore, differs from the present invention in that it
requires the use of an organic binder and it does not use
polyorganosiloxanes.Atwell et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,888,376 produce
high density silicon carbide bodies (> 2.4 g/cm3) by molding
a mixture comprising an organopolysiloxane, a sintering aid, 
an organopolysiloxane curing agent and silicon carbide
powder. The molded mixture is then heated to a temperature
above 1900°C. This reference, however, teaches that its
bodies are highly densified compared to the porous ceramic
bodies known in the art.GB-A-2 002 738 describes a process for producing a
thermal-resistant ceramic fired body in which an
organosilicon polymer is added to a ceramic powder, the
resulting mixture is molded and fired at a temperature of
800°C to 2000°C. The organosilicon polymer may be an
organopolysiloxane and must exhibit a high firing residual
ratio after heating at an elevated temperature. The
ceramic fired bodies have improved mechanical strength and
thermal resistance.The present invention provides porous ceramic
products, using organopolysiloxanes as binders, characterized
by green bodies and resultant ceramics of high strengths.This invention introduces a method of preparing a
porous silicon carbide ceramic
