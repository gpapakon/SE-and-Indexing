<ABSTRACT>
Metal sheets having a layer of a cured polyvinylidene fluoride paint (2) on the metal surface (1) and a layer of a cured fluorinated ethylene vinyl ether (3) paint on the polyvinylidene fluoride paint exhibit excellent weathering properties, have a gloss of 25 to 80 %, and may be bent to a sharp angle without cracking of the coating. Such sheets are particularly useful in the preparation of metal-resin composite laminates, because they do not experience thermal blocking during the lamination step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a coated metal plate which results in the
facile control of the gloss of the coating and prevents the
phenomenon of heat blocking from the heat treatment during
a lamination of the coated metal plate. The present
invention also relates to the coated metal plates prepared
by such a process and laminates comprising such coated
metal plates.Various composite laminates are known wherein a metal
sheet is laminated on a thermoplastic synthetic resin
sheet. U.S. Patent No. 4,508,425 discloses a mirror
manufactured by plating chromium on one surface of a metal
sheet bonded to a composite sheet, made up of a synthetic
resin sheet and the metal sheet, to form a mirror surface.
The mirror may be worked to a desired shape and may be
formed with a decorative pattern.U.S. Patent NO. 4,560,623 discloses a specular product
of bronze-like tone particularly suitable for use as a
decorative material. The specular product uses, as a
substrate, a composite board comprising a synthetic resin
sheet and metal sheets laminated thereon, and includes a
nickel deposit plated on the metal sheet and a specular
film of Sn-Ni alloy electroplated on the nickel deposit
using a specific electroplating bath.Such laminates are useful for a number of
architectural applications, because the laminates combine
light weight with high strength. These laminates may be
used as finished surfaces for all or portions of the
interior or exterior surfaces of a building. It is also desirable to produce metal-resin composite
laminates in a wide variety of colors and with a high
degree of gloss. It is also desirable that such
metal-resin composite laminates exhibit good weathering
resistance and be able to be bent to a sharp angle without
cracking of the coating on the exposed surface of the
metal. However, when metal sheets are coated with
conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) paints, the
coated plates exhibit a phenomenon known as heat blocking
upon subsequent lamination with the resin layer. This heat
blocking phenomenon seriously detracts from the aesthetic
appeal of the finished plate. In addition, use of
conventional PVDF paints results in coatings which have a
gloss within a fairly narrow range, 25 to 35%.Thus, there remains a need for coated metal sheets in
a wide variety of colors and a wide range of gloss, which
do not experience heat blocking on lamination and exhibit
excellent weathering resistance. There also remains a need
for laminates in a wide variety of colors and wide
