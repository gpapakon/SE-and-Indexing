<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for pretreating aluminum-bearing 
surfaces in a vacuum deposition chamber after a previous 

step of cleaning the chamber, and prior to depositing 
tungsten silicide on substrates in the chamber, which first 

comprises treating the aluminum-bearing surfaces with a 
mixture of silane and a tungsten-bearing gas, such as WF₆, 

to form a first deposition of a sliane-based tungsten 
silicide on the aluminum-bearing surfaces. In a preferred 

embodiment, the process further comprises subsequently 
treating the already coated aluminum-bearing surfaces of 

the chamber in a second step with a mixture of a tungsten-bearing 
gas, such as WF₆, and a chlorine-substituted silane 

such as dichlorosilane (SiH₂Cl₂), monochlorosilane 
(SiH₃Cl), or trichlorosilane (SiHCl₃), to form a chlorine-substituted 

silane-based tungsten silicide deposition over 
the previous deposited silane-based tungsten silicide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pretreatment process for a deposition chamber. More
particularly, this invention relates to a pretreatment process for treating the
surfaces of a deposition chamber, after a cleaning step and prior to deposition of
a materials such as tungsten silicide on a substrate.In the deposition of a material such as a tungsten silicide on a substrate, residues
from the deposition process, e.g., tungsten silicide residues, may also be deposited
on the surfaces of the deposition chamber, including the chamber walls and the
susceptor used to support the substrate in the deposition chamber. Repeated
tungsten silicide depositions results in the buildup of such undesirable residues on
the deposition chamber surfaces. To prevent such residues from flaking off the
chamber surfaces, which would result in contamination of the substrate being
processed in the chamber, the chamber is subject to periodic cleaning to remove
such deposition residues. The removal of such tungsten silicide residues from the
deposition chamber surface may be accomplished by the use of a fluorine-containing
etchant such as NF3 or C2F6 gas. Normally, the cleaning of the chamber is performed using a plasma in conjunction
with such fluorine-containing etchant gases and may be followed by a passivation
treatment with hydrogen to remove fluorine-bearing residues remaining in the
chamber. However, in the subsequent deposition of tungsten silicide, after such
a cleaning treatment, it has been found that the initial substrate subsequently
mounted on the susceptor is not adequately receptive to the deposition of a layer
of tungsten silicide.Thus, the tungsten silicide, deposited on the initial or first substrate processed
after cleaning, is of inferior quality and must be rejected. This, of course, is not
only a rejection or loss of the cost of the tungsten silicide layer but also is a
rejection or loss of any other structure previously formed on the substrate, e.g.,
an integrated circuit structure created to that point on a semiconductor wafer.
It will be seen that the loss is not insubstantial. If the vacuum chamber is
cleaned, for example, after every tenth wafer treated with tungsten silicide, the
number of wafers rejected can amount to ten percent.This problem is most apparent when a combination of a tungsten-bearing gas such
as WF6 is used in connection with a chlorine-substituted silane gas such as
dichlorosilane (DCS). Since the formation of a tungsten silicide layer using a
chlorine-substituted silane gas has been found
