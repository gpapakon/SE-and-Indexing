<ABSTRACT>
A composite toner image made up of first and second toners is 
formed on an image member (1). A first electrostatic image of a first 

polarity is formed on the image member (1). That electrostatic image 
is toned with a first toner of the first polarity. The image member (1) 

is imagewise exposed to create a second electrostatic image also of the 
first polarity. Exposure is overlapped into the portion of the image 

member (1) under the first toner image to prevent any charge on the 
photoconductor of the first polarity underneath the first toner image 

from repelling toner into the portions of the second electrostatic image 
that are discharged. Preferably, the second exposure is accomplished 

through the base (3) of the image member in order to thoroughly 
expose portions of the electrostatic image underneath the first toner 

image. A web image member (1) is conveniently exposed through its 
base (3) by a printhead (17) mounted in an assembly (50) including a 

positioning bar (70) for properly spacing the printhead (17) and a lens 
54 from the image member 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the formation of two or more toner 
images in a single frame or area of an image member. Although not 
limited thereto, it is particularly usable in a method and apparatus 
which forms accent color images on a single frame of an image 
member in a single pass. US-A-5,001,028 is representative 
of a number of references describing a process in which a 
photoconductive image member is uniformly charged and imagewise 
exposed to create an electrostatic image. Toner is applied to the 
electrostatic image to create a toner image. Usually, in this process, 
discharged area development is used. Thus, the toner applied is of the 
same polarity as the electrostatic image. It deposits in the areas of 
lowest charge (the discharged areas) to form a toner image having a 
density which is greatest in the portions of the image receiving the 
greatest exposure. Although not absolutely necessary in this process, the image 
member is, again, uniformly charged with a charge of the same 
polarity as the original charge and it is, again, imagewise exposed to 
form a second electrostatic image, generally in the portions of the 
image member not covered by the first toner image. The second 
electrostatic image is toned, again with a toner of the same polarity as 
the charge to create a second toner image. The process can be 
repeated with a third electrostatic image toned by a third color toner to 
create a three color image, etc. The two (or more) color image is 
transferred in a single step to a receiving sheet and fused also in a 
single step. Although the process is not necessarily limited to such 
applications, it is most commonly used to provide accent color prints 
or copies with laser or LED printhead electronic exposure. The process has a number of advantages in accent color 
applications. It eliminates the troublesome and expensive steps usually 
used in registering images at transfer. If it uses separate exposure 
stations, it can produce accent color output at the same speed as single 
color output.  
 It is important that the second and subsequent toning steps not 
disturb the first toner image. Otherwise, toner from the first toner 
image gets mixed into the second development station ("scavenging") 
and toner from the second development station can be deposited on the 
first toner image ("overtoning"). Recharging between images reduces 
overtoning. Much of the art prior to US-A-5,001,028 recommends use of 
projection toning for the second and subsequent toning steps in order 
not to

A method of forming a composite toner image 
comprising: 


forming a first toner image on an image member (1) 
made up of dry toner particles of a first polarity,
