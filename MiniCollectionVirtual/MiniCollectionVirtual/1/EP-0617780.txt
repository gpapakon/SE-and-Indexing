<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to low NOx burners for 
gas turbines engines, and in particular to 
stabilization and combustion efficiency improvement 
of the lean burner. Nitric oxide emissions from gas turbine engines 
contribute to the production of photochemical smog. 
An effective strategy for reducing 
combustor-generated NOx is to lower the flame 
temperature by mixing the air and fuel (prior to 
combustion) in proportions so the overall mixture is 
fuel-lean. If the combustor is designed to operate 
with a lean mixture at full-power conditions, then 
as fuel flow is reduced to part power conditions, 
the premixed air system becomes too lean to support 
stable combustion. As a result, some strategy must 
be used to sustain combustion. Examples are the use 
of staging wherein selected combustion zones are 
shut down so that the remaining zones are enriched, 
or the use of variable geometry air passages wherein 
a portion of the air which would normally enter the 
combustion chamber is bypassed around the combustion 
chamber so that the combustion chamber mixture is 
enriched. All strategies for increasing the range of 
operation of lean premixed combustion entail some 
compromise. For example, the use of staging 
complicates the fuel control system and requires  
 
additional cooled combustor walls which separate the 
combustion zones. The use of variable geometry burn 
passages compromises cost and reliability. A strategy 
which minimizes the penalties incurred is sought. According to the invention, we provide a low NOx 
burner for the combustor of a gas turbine comprising: 
   a flameholder plate having a face facing the 
combustor; 
   a plurality of perforations through said plate; 
   a gaseous fuel premixing tube extending through 
each perforation terminating as an open end at the face 
of said plate; 
   at least one gas pilot tube extending through said 
plate, and extending through the face of said plate, the 
or each gas pilot tube being located amongst the 
plurality of surrounding fuel premixing tubes; 
   a plurality of pilot jet openings in the combustor 
end of the or each pilot tube, each directing a jet of 
fuel substantially parallel to the face of said plate to 
zones between imaginary extensions of said fuel 
premixing tubes closest to said gas pilot tube; and 
   air passages for directing a portion of the gas 
turbine airflow through said premixing tubes. In accordance with this invention a small quantity 
of pilot fuel may be injected into those portions of the 
combustion zone
