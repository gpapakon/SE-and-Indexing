<ABSTRACT>
A door holder assembly (10), for attachment between a door 
jamb (14) and a door (12) to hold the door in an open 

position includes a jamb bracket (16) attached to the door 
jamb and a jamb arm (18) pivotally attached to the jamb 

bracket. A channel assembly (22) having a longitudinally 
extending channel (23) is attached to the door and a hold 

open stop (28) is fixed in the channel (23). The hold open 
stop (28) has a stop element (38) with first and second 

ramps (39, 40) engageable by a slide assembly (26). The 
slide assembly is pivotally attached to the jamb arm and 

positioned for longitudinal movement in the channel, with 
the slide assembly having a slide frame (27) supporting a 

rocker (42) pivotably connected to the slide frame. The 
rocker has a catch (44) on one side of a pivot (43) and a 

rocker face (45) on the opposite side of the pivot, with 
the catch able to slide over the first ramp for reversible 

engagement with the second ramp of the stop element to hold 
the door in an open position. The force required to slide 

the catch over the first and second ramps is determined by 
the preload force on an adjustment wedge that engages the 

rocker face.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus for 
holding open a door and, more particularly, to a door 
holder assembly having a shock absorber and an 
automatically engageable holding feature when the door is 
swung open to a predetermined angle. Temporarily holding a door in an open position is often 
necessary for convenience and safety. One commonly 
employed method of doing so uses an overhead door control 
device that includes a pivoting arm attached between an 
upper portion of a door jamb and an upper part of a door. 
When the door is to be held open at an angle that does not 
exceed about 110 degrees, an overhead door control device 
is efficient, effective and convenient to install and 
maintain. Overhead door control devices are less subject 
to damage by vandalism or accidents and do not present a 
potential stumbling hazard. Automatic door holders with a separate adjustment of the 
amount of force necessary to disengage the door holder from 
its held open position are useful. However, many 
conventional overhead door control devices are difficult to 
adjust, often requiring special tools or expertise. Even 
if the door holder is correctly set at installation, with 
time and wear on the door holder mechanism, the door holder 
opening angle and force required to disengage the door may 
change. If the door holder is difficult to accurately set, 
or if it requires special tools and expertise to adjust, it 
is likely that the door holder will not be appropriately 
maintained and will not provide the required convenience 
and safety. Too many overhead door holders are not 
durable, are not easy to install and maintain and are 
difficult to adjust. Such door holders often require  
 
special tools for installation and maintenance and have no 
provisions to prevent damage from violent or forceful door 
opening. They also may lack the desired automatic hold-open 
feature once the door is swung open a predetermined 
angle, and they may not allow for easy controllable release 
of the door from its held open position when desired. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
door holder assembly for attachment between a door jamb and 
a door for selectively holding the door in an open 
position, comprising a jamb bracket for attachment to the 
door jamb; a jamb arm pivotally attached to the jamb 
bracket; a channel assembly for attachment to a door and 
having a channel therein; characterised by a hold open stop 
fixed in the channel having a stop element with a first

<CLAIMS>
A door holder assembly (10) for attachment between a 
door jamb (14) and a door (12) for selectively holding the 

door in an open position, comprising a jamb bracket (16) 
for attachment to the door jamb (14); a jamb arm (18) 

pivotally attached to the jamb bracket (16); a channel 
assembly (22) for attachment to a door and having a channel 

(23) therein; characterised by a hold open stop (28) fixed 
in the channel (23) having a stop element (38) with a first 

ramp (39) and a second ramp (40); and a slide assembly (26) 
pivotally attached to the jamb arm (18) and positioned for 

longitudinal movement in the channel, the slide assembly 
having a slide frame (27) shaped to support a rocker (42) 

pivotably connected to the slide frame, the rocker having 
a catch (44) and rocker face (45), with the catch (44) 

shaped to slide over the first ramp (39) for reversible 
engagement with the second ramp (40) of the stop element 

(38) to hold the door in use in an open position. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the slide 
assembly (26) further comprises an adjustment wedge (46) 

having a wedge face (52), the adjustment wedge being 
positioned to contact the rocker face (45) and control 

positioning of the rocker catch (44) with respect to the 
stop element (38). 
An assembly according to claim 2, wherein the 
adjustment wedge (46) has a wedge channel (54) shaped to 

accommodate a position pin (56) attached to the slide frame 
(27) that provides a predefined limited range of movement 

of the adjustment wedge (46) with respect to the slide 
frame (27) and the rocker (42). 
An assembly according to claim 2 or 3, wherein a 
compression spring (50) is connected between the adjustment 

wedge (46) and the slide frame (27) to resist movement of 
the adjustment wedge as the catch (44) of the rocker (42) 

moves along the first ramp (39). 
An assembly according to claim 4, wherein an 
adjustment screw (48) holds the compression spring (50) and 

is attached to the slide frame (27) to allow adjustment of 
bias of the compression spring. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, and comprising a centring post for retention of a 

stop spring (30) which is positioned to resist compression 
and absorb door opening force as the slide frame (27) 

contacts the stop spring. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said rocker (42) terminates in said catch 

(44), which is on a first side of a pivot mount (43) of the 
rocker and said rocker face (45) is on the opposite side of 

the pivot mount. 
A door incorporating a door holder assembly according 
to any one of the preceding claims.
