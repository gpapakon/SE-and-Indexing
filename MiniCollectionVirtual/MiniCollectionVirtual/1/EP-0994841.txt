<ABSTRACT>
A method is disclosed for preparing 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde by using silica gel to isomerize 3,3-dimethyl-1,2-epoxybutane, which in turn may be prepared by oxidation of dimethylbutene. Also disclosed is a method for oxidizing dimethylbutene with dimethyldioxirane to form 3,3-dimethyl-1,2-epoxybutane. The methods provide an economical means of preparing 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for preparing 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde
in a highly economical manner by
regioselective isomerization of vaporized 1,2-epoxy-3,3-dimethylbutane
in the presence of silica gel. The
invention also relates to a method for preparing
1,2-epoxy-3,3-dimethylbutane from 3,3-dimethylbutene by
oxidation with dimethyldioxirane.Rearrangement of epoxides to carbonyl compounds has
long been known. See, e.g., Smith, J.G. Synthesis, 629
(1984). For example, epoxides have been converted to
aldehydes in a regiospecific manner through the use of
lithium perchlorate in dimethyl ether (LPDE).
Sudha, R., et al. J. Org. Chem. 61, 1877 (1996).
However, this reference discloses that acyclic terminal
olefin epoxides, such as 1,2-epoxyhexane did not react
in the LPDE medium. Yet another example is provided by Lemini, C., et al.,
Synth. Commun. 25, 2695 (1995) which report the
transformation of arylmonosubstituted and 2-aryl, 2-methyl
disubstituted oxiranes to aldehydes using silica
gel as a reagent in solution under very mild
conditions. U.S. Patent No. 2,660,609 is directed to
the isomerization of alkylene oxides such as ethylene
oxide, 1,2-propylene oxide or 1,2 butylene oxide to
aldehydes in the vapor phase using silica gel or
fuller's earth in a fluidized form. However, these
references do not disclose or suggest the regiospecific
isomerization of 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde with silica
gel.Moreover, the latter reference also describes the
formation of ketones and alcohols along with aldehydes
in the isomerization of 1,2-epoxyalkanes with silica.
The rearrangement gives different products (aldehydes,
ketones, or alcohols) depending upon the reagents,
reaction conditions and substituents (reviews on the
isomerization of epoxides to aldehydes: J.G.,
Synthesis 1984, 637; Rickborn, B. in Comprehensive
Organic Synthesis, ed. B.M. Trost, I. Fleming and G.
Pattenden, Pergamon, Oxford, 1991, vol. 3, p. 733-775).
Therefore, the behavior of the tert-butyl group is not
predictable from that of the straight or other branched
chain alkanes. For example, rearrangement of 1,2-epoxyalkanes
(House, H., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77,
5083; where R is alkyl group) with boron trifluoride
etherate gives only aldehyde and no ketone, whereas
when R is a tert-butyl group, a mixture of products or
the starting material are recovered (unpublished
results). With LiBr-basic alumina only ketone,
pinacolone, is formed (unpublished results). The
