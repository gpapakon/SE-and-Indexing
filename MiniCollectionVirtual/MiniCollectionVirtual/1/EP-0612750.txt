A cephalosporin derivative of formula


wherein R denotes a lower alkyl group and R
1
 denotes hydrogen or the methoxy group.
Use of a cephalosporin derivative of formula III according to claim 1 as an intermediate
in the production of a cephalosporin derivative.
Use according to claim 2, characterized in that the cephalosporin derivative of formula
III is obtained by reaction of a compound of formula


 
wherein R and R
1
 are as defined in claim 1 and R
2
 denotes the methyl or the amine
group, with a trialkyliodosilane.
Use according to claim 3, characterized in that the trialkyliodosilane is
trimethyliodosilane.
Use according to any one of claims 3 or 4 characterized in that 1.1 to 1.5 equivalents of
trialkyliodosilane are used per equivalent of cephalosporin derivative of formula IV.
Process for the production of a cephalosporin derivative of formula


wherein

R
1
 is hydrogen or methoxy,
R
3

characterised in that a cephalosporin derivative of formula III according to claim 1 is
reacted with a desired nucleophile and the derivative obtained which is substituted in

position 3 by the residue of the nucleophile is either deprotected by splitting off the silyl
protecting groups, or acylated with an acylating agent in position 7 and deprotected by

splitting off the silyl protecting groups.
Process according to claim 6, characterised in that the cephalosporin derivative of
formula III is obtained according to any one of claims 3 to 5.
