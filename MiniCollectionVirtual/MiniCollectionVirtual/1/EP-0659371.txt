<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cold showcase provided with 
a frame (1) comprising a storage 

space (3') for containing products to be displayed 
and kept in cold storage, which are placed on a display platform 

(3) of the 
cold showcase, whereby a front side of said storage space turned towards 

the clientele can be closed by at least one glass panel (8'), 
which pivots about 

an at least substantially horizontally extending pivot axis located near 
the upper side (11) of said 

glass panel (8'), so that the glass panel can pivot 
through the storage space (3'), from a position 

in which the glass panel closes 
said storage space at its front side in a direction towards the rear side 

of the storage space, and can be fixed in a position in which said storage 
space is at least partly accessible from its front side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cold showcase provided with 
a frame comprising a storage space for containing products to be displayed 
and kept in cold storage, which are placed on a display platform of the 
cold showcase, whereby a front side of said storage space turned towards 
the clientele can be closed by at least one glass panel, which pivots about 
an at least substantially horizontally extending pivot axis located near 
the upper side of said glass panel. In shops and supermarkets foodstuffs are brought to 
the notice of the customers inter alia by means of cold showcases 
especially developed for this purpose, in which the products are displayed 
in refrigerated condition. In a service showcase products are displayed 
which can be obtained by the customers through the intermediary of 
attendant staff. In a self-service showcase (usually pre-packaged) products 
are displayed, which the customers can take out of the showcase themselves. 
Due to the different functions there is a great difference in the 
construction of the two showcases. Already when designing the lay-out of his store or 
supermarket the entrepreneur will therefore have to decide on the 
proportion between service and self-service. Due to the rapidly changing 
purchasing behaviour the shop interior requires constant adjusting. Furthermore there are great differences in the turnover 
at the beginning of the week and at the end of the week. Because of this 
it is necessary to add part-timers to the number of personnel at the end 
of the week. Another possibility is to offer more products for self-service 
during that period, as indeed this manner of presentation requires fewer 
staff. The problem is thereby that different showcases are 
used for service and self-service. Consequently there is a need for a 
showcase which is normally used for service, and which can be transformed 
into a self-service showcase during peak hours in a simple manner. From DE-A-4 110 942 a cold showcase is known, wherein 
this problem has been solved by coupling the glass panel to the other part 
of the cold showcase by means of a rod assembly near its upper side, in 
such a manner that the glass panel is pivoted upwards from its position 
closing the storage space at its front side, in a direction remote from  
 
the storage space, and is furthermore moved in a direction remote from 
the side turned towards the clientele, until said glass panel occupies 
a horizontal position, in which the glass panel is positioned higher than 
the storage space and

<CLAIMS>
A cold showcase provided with a frame comprising 
a storage space for containing products to be displayed and kept in cold 

storage, which are placed on a display platform of the cold showcase, 
whereby a front side of said storage space turned towards the clientele 

can be closed by at least one glass panel, which pivots about an at least 
substantially horizontally extending pivot axis located near the upper 

side of said glass panel, characterized in that said glass panel can pivot 
through the storage space, from a position in which the glass panel closes 

said storage space at its front side in a direction towards the rear side 
of the storage space, and can be fixed in a position in which said storage 

space is at least partly accessible from its front side. 
A cold showcase according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said glass panel can be moved to at least two positions from its 

closing position. 
A cold showcase according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a supporting surface for mounting publicity means 

or the like thereon, which can pivot along with the glass panel, is 
provided on the upper part of the glass panel, said supporting surface 

extending at least substantially horizontally in the closed position of 
the glass panel and extending in upward direction in the open position 

of said glass panel. 
A cold showcase according to claim 3, characterized 
in that said supporting surface is formed by a plate-shaped part, which 

forms part of a supporting means which pivots about said pivot axis, and 
by means of which the upper end of said glass panel is clamped down on 

a part of the supporting means located under said glass panel. 
A cold showcase according to claim 4, characterized 
in that a locking means is pivotally coupled to said supporting means with 

one end, whilst the other end of said locking means can be fixed to the 
frame in several positions. 
A cold showcase according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a locking means is coupled with the glass 

panel at the side of the showcase remote from the clientele, which locking 
means is connected to the glass panel with one end and which can be fixed 

to the frame with its other end in the closing position of the glass panel.
