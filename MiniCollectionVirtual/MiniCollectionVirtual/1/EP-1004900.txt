<ABSTRACT>
A system for remotely controlling and monitoring the acquisition of
seismic data. The system includes remote equipment for collecting seismic

data and for transmitting and receiving communication signals to and from a
remote location. The system also includes local equipment for transmitting

and receiving communication signals to and from the remote location. In this
manner, the collection of seismic data at remote locations can be controlled

and monitored locally.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of provisional patent
application serial number           (attorney docket number
14737.604) filed on August 7, 1998.This invention relates generally to remote control systems, and in
particular to remote control systems for seismic acquisition systems.Seismic acquisition systems are used to gather seismic data.
Typically seismic acquisition systems are used to gather seismic data in
remote locations all around the world. Furthermore, seismic acquisition
systems are commonly installed and operated on mobile platforms such as,
for example, trucks, barges and boats. Existing seismic acquisition systems
do not permit remote control and monitoring of the acquisition of seismic
data.The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the
limitations of the existing seismic acquisition systems.According to one aspect of the present invention, a system for
remotely controlling and monitoring the acquisition of seismic data is
provided that includes a seismic data acquisition system, an Ethernet 
communications interface, an ISDN router, a first ISDN communications
interface, a first ISDN converter, a first RS-422 communications interface, a
first microwave communications transceiver, a second microwave
communications transceiver, a second RS-422 communications interface, a
second ISDN converter, a second ISDN communications interface, an ISDN
network, and a customer support center. The Ethernet communications
interface is operably coupled to the seismic data acquisition system. The
ISDN router is operably coupled to the Ethernet communications interface.
The first ISDN communications interface is operably coupled to the ISDN
router. The first ISDN converter is operably coupled to the first ISDN
communications interface. The first RS-422 communications interface is
operably coupled to the ISDN converter. The first microwave transceiver is
operably coupled to the first RS-422 communications interface. The second
microwave transceiver is operably coupled to the first microwave
transceiver. The second RS-422 communications interface is operably
coupled to the second microwave transceiver. The second ISDN converter is
operably coupled to the second RS-422 communications interface. The
second ISDN communications interface is operably coupled to the second
ISDN converter. The ISDN network is operably coupled to the second ISDN
communications interface. The customer support center is operably coupled
to the ISDN network.According to another aspect of the present
