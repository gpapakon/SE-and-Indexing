<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a blowing
composition for producing foams (foamed articles) of
thermoplastic resins, such as polystyrene, polyethylene,
polypropylene, etc. and polyurethane.In the specification and claims, "%" and
"parts" means "% by weight" and "parts by weight",
respectively.Dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC12),
dichlorotetrafluoroethane (CFC114) and like halogenated
hydrocarbons have been employed as blowing agents for
producing foams of themoplastic resins and polyurethane.
In resent years, however, it is pointed out that when
released into the atmosphere, some of CFCs would deplete
ozone in the stratospheric layer, thereby inflicting a
serious adverse influence on the ecosystem including man
on the earth. Consequently, a worldwide agreement calls
for the restriction of use and production of CFCs having
high possibility of depletion of ozone layer. From this
point of view, there is a demand for development of a
novel blowing agent which has no or very low risk to 
cause a ozone-depletion problem.LPG seems to be employed instead of CFCs with such problems. However, using
LPG as a blowing agent has another serious problem that foam products having
homogeneous cells can not be obtained by LPG.US-4,528,300 discloses the use of 1-chloro-1,1-difluoroethane or 1,1-difluoroethane
in conjunction with a stability control agent.EP-0 451 016 discloses an azeotrope of 1,1,1-trifluoroethane and propane for use
in industrial refrigeration processes.The present inventors have conducted extensive research in considering the prior
art, and found that a composition comprising (1) difluoromethane only, or more
than one member selected from the group consisting of difluoromethane, 1,1-difluoroethane
and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane and (2) at least one member selected
from the group consisting of propane, i-butane, n-butane, pentane, isopentane,
cyclopentane and dimethylether has blowing characteristics which can not be
predicted from those of the component substances taken individually, i.e.,
excellent in dimensional stability, appearance, compressive strength and
homogeneity of cells, thereby exerts excellent effects as a blowing agent on the
production of foams of a thermoplastic resin and urethane.Thus, the invention provides compositions for producing foams of a thermoplastic
resin and urethane shown below:
A blowing composition comprising (1) difluoromethane only, or more than one
member selected from the group consisting of 
difluoromethane (hereinafter HFC32), 1,1-difluoroethane
(hereinafter HFC152a) and
