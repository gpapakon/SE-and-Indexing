<ABSTRACT>
The invention connects the operation of a driving-force 
distributing device (8), for example a multi-plate 

friction clutch of a differential (7), with the 
operation of a driving-force suppressing device, such as 

a traction control device, to ensure stable performance 
of a vehicle. When both driven wheels (3,4) are racing, 

the driving-force distributing device (8) holds a 

differential operation limiting at a predetermined 
value. If racing further increases, the driving-force 

suppressing device holds the engine output at a 
predetermined value. At that time, if the slip rates of 

the inner or outer racing driven wheels are further 
increased, the driving-force suppressing device reduces 

the engine output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a driving-force
control-system for a vehicle, and more particularly, to a
driving-force control system for a vehicle for controlling
the operation of a driving-force distributing device and
the operation of a driving-force suppressing device in
connection with each other in accordance with a slipping
state of a wheel.One conventionally well-known driving-force
distributing device has a multi-plate friction clutch
disposed between left and right driven wheels, so that the
torque for the driven wheels is controlled by bringing the
multi-plate clutch into an engaged state to distribute a
predetermined differential operation limiting torque from
the raced driven wheel to the non-raced driven wheel. In
a vehicle including the driving-force distributing device,
the racing of one wheel can be prevented by distributing
a torque from the raced driven wheel to the non-raced
driven wheel, thereby enhancing the driving performance.
However, there is a possibility that the non-raced driven
wheel, which receives the distributed torque, will start
to race, resulting in a substantially reduced driving
performance and exerting an influence to the stability of
the vehicle.Another conventionally well-known driving-force
suppressing device reduces the engine output in accordance
with a slipping state of a driven wheel to prevent
excessive slipping of the driven wheel. In a vehicle
including the driving-force suppressing device, the torque
can be reduced during racing of the driven wheel to
prevent excessive slipping. However, there is a
possibility that the torque is reduced more than
necessary, resulting in a reduced driving performance of
the vehicle. A driving-force control system including both
the driving-force distributing device and the driving-force
suppressing device is known from Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open No. 85050/90.It is an object of the present invention to
connect the operation of the driving-force distributing
device with the operation of the driving-force suppressing
device at an appropriate timing to ensure a stable
performance of the vehicle.To achieve the above object, according to the
present invention, there is provided a driving-force
control system for a vehicle controlling the operation
of a driving-force distributing device for adjusting the
distribution of a driving force between driven wheels, as
well as the operation of a driving-force suppressing
device for suppressing the driving-force for the driven wheels.
