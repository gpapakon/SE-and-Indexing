<ABSTRACT>
A high temperature resistant, corrugated, metal 
wire mesh mounting mat (32) has a high temperature 

sealing material (34). 
The high temperature sealing material comprises binder material in the 

range from about 5 to about 85 percent by weight and dispersed therein 
glass particles in the range from about 95 to about 15 percent by 

weight, based on the total weight of said binder material and said glass 
particles, wherein said glass particles are made of a glass having a 

softening point of at least about 350°C, and wherein the combined weight 
of said binder material and said glass particles is at least 20 percent 

by weight of the total weight of said high temperature sealing material. 
The mounting mat is useful in the 

construction of catalytic converters and diesel 
particulate traps (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high temperature 
resistant, corrugated, metal wire mesh mounting mats with 
a high temperature sealing material. The mounting mats 
are useful in the construction of catalytic converters 
and diesel particulate traps or filters. High temperature metal (e.g., stainless steel) wire 
mesh mounting mats are used to hold monoliths (e.g., 
catalytic converter elements or diesel particulate 
filters) in place while being subjected to exposure to 
gases at moderate pressure pulsations and temperatures 
(typically less than about 700°C). The inherently porous 
nature of such mats, for example, when used as a mounting 
mat in a catalytic converter utilizing a monolithic 
catalytic converter element allows at least a portion of 
exhaust gases to bypass the catalytic converter element 
and flow through the mounting mat. The present invention provides a mounting mat 
comprising: 
(a) a high temperature resistant, corrugated, 
metal wire mesh mat having a lateral edge; 
and (b) a sufficient amount of a high temperature 
sealing material covering the lateral edge 
to reduce penetration, when exposed to 
hot, impinging gases (i.e., above about 
300°C, preferably above about 350°C, and 
more preferably above about 500°C), of the 
gases through the lateral edge, the high 
temperature sealing material comprising 
binder material in the range from about 5  
 
binder material in the range from about 5 
to about 85 percent by weight and 
dispersed (uniformly or nonuniformly) 
therein glass particles in the range from 
about 95 to about 15 percent by weight, 
based on the total weight of the binder 
material and the glass particles, wherein 
the glass particles are made of a glass 
having a softening point of at least about 
350°C, and wherein the combined weight of 
the binder material and the glass 
particles is at least 20 percent by weight 
(preferably, at least about 35 percent by 
weight, more preferably, at least about 50 
percent by weight, and, most preferably, 
at least about 75 percent by weight) of 
the total weight of the high temperature 
sealing material. In yet another aspect, the present invention 
provides a mounting mat comprising: 
(a) a high temperature resistant, corrugated, metal 
wire mesh mat having first and second lateral 
edges; and (b) a sufficient amount of the high temperature 
sealing material incorporated in the mounting 
mat to reduce penetration, when exposed to hot, 
impinging gases, of the gases through the first 
lateral edge to the second lateral edge. In
