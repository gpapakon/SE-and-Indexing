<ABSTRACT>
Described are shaped cellulose acetate articles within which or on whose surface is present an additive, said additive consisting of a nitrogen-containing organic compound whose degradation through microorganisms gives rise to basic decomposition products, in particular ammonia and/or basic compounds having an NH group or NH groups and/or an NH2 group or NH2 groups. The articles can have the shape of filaments, fibres, films, sheets, plates or other structures. The invention also relates to the use of the articles in the form of filaments and/or fibres for the manufacture of filter tow, to such a filter tow and to the use of such a filter tow for manufacturing a tobacco smoke filter element and to such a tobacco smoke filter element. The articles, the filter tow and the tobacco smoke filter element of the invention show improved biodegradation under the action of environmental influences, but the filter tow and the tobacco smoke filter element can be stored under the conditions customary today without risk of microbiological degradation.

<CLAIMS>
Structures formed from cellulose acetate which
have the form of filaments, fibres, free-standing

films, supported films, sheets or other articles
obtained by injection moulding, extrusion moulding or

blow moulding and in which there is present an additive
which consists of a nitrogenous organic compound whose

degradation by microorganisms gives rise to basic
decomposition products, especially ammonia and/or basic

compounds which contain an NH group or NH groups and/or
an NH
2
 group or NH
2
 groups.
Structures according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the nitrogenous organic compound is urea, a

urea derivative, a protein, especially Î²-lactoglobulin,
a condensation product of an aldehyde with ammonia or

with an amine, in which case this condensation product
is hexamethylenetetramine in particular, or a cyclic

compound, especially carbazole.
Structures according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the cellulose acetate is an

acetone-soluble cellulose acetate having an acetyl
number of less than 53%, especially an acetyl number

between 50 and 52%.
Use of the structures in the form of filaments
and/or fibres according to at least one of Claims 1 to

3 for producing filter tow by collecting a multiplicity
of these filaments and/or fibres to make a filter tow.
Filter tow, characterized in that it consists
of a multiplicity of the structures in the form of 

filaments and/or fibres according to at least one of
Claims 1 to 3.
Use of the filter tow according to Claim 5 for
producing a tobacco smoke filter element by essentially

providing this filter tow with a plasticizer for
cellulose acetate or an adhesive, then transverseaxially

compacting and optionally sheathing this filter
tow with a sheathing strip, cutting the thusly

compacted optionally sheathed filter tow into
individual tobacco smoke filter rods and finally

cutting these tobacco smoke filter rods into individual
tobacco smoke filter elements.
Tobacco smoke filter element consisting of a
section of a transverse-axially compacted filter tow

composed of cellulose acetate filaments and/or
cellulose acetate fibres and set with the aid of a

plasticizer for cellulose acetate or with the aid of an
adhesive, characterized in that the filter tow is a

filter tow according to Claim 5.
Tobacco smoke filter element according to
Claim 7, characterized in that the plasticizer present

in the cellulose acetate is biodegradable and/or
accelerates the microbiological colonization of the

cellulose acetate filaments and fibres or the adhesive
is water-soluble and/or biodegradable.
