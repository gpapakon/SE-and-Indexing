<ABSTRACT>
To make a ballastless track superstructure, an asphalt carrier layer 3 is applied to a substructure 2 consisting of concrete and sleepers 5 having a central recess 4 on their underside are laid on this asphalt carrier layer 3. In order to secure the sleepers 5 against transverse forces and in order to guarantee a wear-free anchoring of accurate fit, the sleepers 5 have a central bore 8 and the substructure has a blind bore 9. An adhesive is introduced into the blind bore 9 and a dowel 13, which is guided through a sliding and spacer bush 11 inserted into the sleeper bore 8, is then inserted into this blind bore 9.

A method of producing a ballastless track superstructure, in which
 
   an asphalt base course (3) is applied to a bed consisting of concrete 

and upon it are laid monoblock sleepers (5) which are provided on their 
undersides with central recesses (4) and at both sides of the recess (4) 

rest upon the asphalt base course (3), secured against transverse forces,
characterized in that
 
the sleepers (5) are provided in the centre with a drilled hole (8) and 

after the respective sleeper (5) has been laid another hole is produced, 
drilled via the aforesaid hole (8) down to the base course as a blind 

hole (9), an adhesive being introduced into the said blind hole (9) and 
then a fastener penetrating the drilled holes (8, 9) is driven into the 

blind hole (9) so as to be able to shift with respect to the wall of the 
one drilled hole (8) in the direction of the axis of the holes yet rests 

against the said wall. 
A method as in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
   a two-component adhesive is introduced into the blind hole (9) as the 

adhesive. 
A method as in Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 
   a cartridge (10) containing the two components of the adhesive is 

introduced into the blind hole (9). 
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 
   before the fastener is driven into the hole (8) drilled in the 

sleeper a sliding and spacer bush (11) is inserted. 
A method as in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
   a spacer bush (11) consisting of plastics is inserted. 
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 
   between the bearing areas (6) on the sleepers (5) and the asphalt 

base course (3) a geotextile (7) is laid on the asphalt base course (3). 
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 
   the sleepers (5) are surrounded by a cement or bitumen bonded sound-absorbent 

material.  
 
A method as in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
   the space between adjacent sleepers (5) is shelved with the said 

material. 
A method as in one of the Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 
   the amount of adhesive is adequate to fill the whole gap between the 

blind hole (9) and the fastener and when the fastener has been driven 
right in the adhesive escapes from the top of the blind hole (9). 
A ballastless track superstructure with a bed to which is applied
 
   an asphalt base course (3) with monoblock sleepers (5) laid upon 

it, which are provided on their undersides with central recesses (4) and 
at both sides of the recess (4) rest upon the asphalt base course (3), 

secured against transverse forces, 
characterized in that
 
the sleepers (5) exhibit central holes (8) drilled vertically and a blind 

hole (9) drilled to reach down into the bed is provided in line with the 
said drilled hole (8), whilst into the drilled holes (8, 9) is inserted a 

fastener which is glued into the blind hole (9) but is able to shift with 
respect to the wall of the one drilled hole (8) in the direction of the 

axis of the holes yet rests against the said wall. 
A ballastless track superstructure as in Claim 10,
 
   
characterized in that
 the fastener is a dowel (13) which stands up 
above the sleeper (5) and the hole (8) drilled in the sleeper is guided 

by sliding along it. 
A ballastless track superstructure as in Claim 10,
 
   
characterized in that
 the fastener is a threaded rod (16) which 
stands up above the sleeper (5) and the hole (8) drilled in the sleeper 

is guided by sliding along it. 
A ballastless track superstructure as in Claim 12,
 
   
characterized in that
 a nut is screwed onto the threaded rod (16) 
with a spring washer (18) inserted between the sleeper (5) and the nut. 
A ballastless track superstructure as in Claim 13,
 
   
characterized in that
 a plain washer (17) is arranged under the 
spring washer (18).  

 
A ballastless track superstructure as in one of the Claims 10 to 14,
 
   
characterized in that
 a sliding and spacer bush (11) which exhibits a 
collar (12) is inserted into the hole (8) drilled in the sleeper. 
A ballastless track superstructure as in one of the Claims 10 to 15,
 
   
characterized in that
 a sliding and spacer bush (11) which is inserted 
into the hole (8) drilled in the sleeper, ends at the top edge of the 

recess (4).
