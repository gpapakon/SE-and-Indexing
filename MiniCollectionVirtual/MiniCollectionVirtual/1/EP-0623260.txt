<ABSTRACT>
A transponder for use in an object indentification system including an interrogator which transmits a continuous interrogation signal and detects a responsive identification signal transmitted by the transponder. The transponder receives and detects the interrogation signal and, in response to receipt of the interrogation signal, produces a repeating identification signal having a fixed number of binary bits consisting of an identification data portion of a specified number of consecutive bits less than one half of the fixed number of bits, and a synchronization pattern of consecutive bits consisting of first, second and third bits of alternating binary values, a consecutive sequence of a plurality of bits which are all of the same binary value as the second bit, and a single bit of the same binary value as the first and third bits. The identification signal is modulated onto a carrier signal and transmitted. Preferably, the first, second and third bits and the sequence of a plurality of bits constitute one half of the fixed number of binary bits of the identification signal, with the binary value of the first bit being a binary 1.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved 
transponder for a proximity identification system. More 
particularly, the present invention related to an improved 
transponder for an identification system of the type 
wherein an interrogator, located for example at a fixed 
installation, transmits an interrogating signal to activate 
a portable transponder device or tag, which would 
ordinarily be carried by a person, an animal or an object, 
which is in the vicinity or proximity of the interrogator 
to cause the transponder to produce and transmit a coded 
identifying signal to a receiver conventionally located at 
the same location as the interrogator, The receiver, upon 
detection of a valid identifying code from the transponder 
then activates some system function, for example, to 
provide access to a controlled area or to keep track of the 
person, animal or object. In such proximity systems, the interrogating or 
activating signal is conventionally a continuous signal of 
a predetermined frequency which is inductively coupled to 
the transponder by means of an electromagnetic coupling 
arrangement and which supplies power to the transponder. 
The transponder, in turn, continuously produces its unique 
identifying signal for as long as it is activated, and 
transmits same back to the receiver by modulating a 
carrier, of a frequency different than the interrogating 
frequency, with the coded information signal. The output 
signal of the transponder is in turn inductively coupled to 
the receiver either by means of a magnetic field, an 
electrostatic field or simultaneously by both a magnetic  
 
and an electrostatic field as disclosed, for example, in 
US-A-5,099,227, the subject matter of which is incorporated 
herein by reference. US-A-4,926,182 discloses a microwave data 
transmission and receiving system in which an interrogator 
has a transmitter for transmitting microwave signals with 
a modulation period and a non-modulation period. The 
transponder gives a modulation based on data in the memory 
portion with respect to the carrier wave during the non-modulation 
period and transmits microwave signals after 
modulation.  
 As indicated above, upon being activated, the 
transponder continuously produces and transmits an output 
signal containing its unique identifying code. Accordingly, 
in order to be able to detect the code in the receiver, it 
is likewise necessary for the transponder to produce and 
include in its output signal a synchronizing signal or 
pattern. While various types of
