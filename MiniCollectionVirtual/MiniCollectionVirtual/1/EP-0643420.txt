<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating a self-aligned thin film transistor 
(TFT) with a lift-off technique includes the steps of forming a multi-tier 

island on a semiconductive layer such that the island structure is 
disposed in a desired alignment over the gate electrode. The island 

structure includes a base layer portion, an intermediate body portion, 
and an upper cap portion, which overhangs the intermediate body 

portion by an amount between about 0.5 µm and 1.5 µm. Source and 
drain electrodes are formed such that the source/drain material is 

disposed over the semiconductive material up to the sidewalls of the 
base portion of the island structure, which base portion is patterned 

such that the source and drain electrodes are self-aligned with and 
extend a selected overlap distance over the gate to provide desired 

TFT performance characteristics. The upper cap layer is removed in a 
lift-off technique and the intermediate body portion of the island is 

removed to complete fabrication oft the TFT.

Application PCT/US 94/01737 and EP 94909684.6 (corresponding
to the US application of G.Possin et al
entitled "Self-Aligned Thin-Film Transistor
Constructed Using Lift-Off Technique", Serial No.
08/024,050, filed 1 March 1993), and the European
application 94302246.7 (corresponoding to the US
application of R.Kwasnick et al entitled "Self-Aligned
Thin Film Transistor Constructed Using Lift-Off
Technique", Serial No. 08/043,043, filed 5 April
1993) both of which are assigned to the assignee of
the present invention and are incorporated herein by
reference.This invention relates to the manufacture of thin-film field
effect transistors, and in particular to a method of patterning the
source and drain electrodes to have a desired alignment with the gate
electrode.In solid state electronic devices thin film field effect
transistors (TFTs) are commonly used as switches. In particular, in
imaging and display devices, a TFT is commonly associated with
each pixel to enable a respective electrical signal to be coupled to or
from each individual pixel. To maximize the active pixel area in an
imager or display device, it is advantageous that the TFT be as small
as possible. Further, the large number of pixels in an array require
that the associated TFTs be relatively small so as to not require
physically larger arrays. Additionally, array performance is improved
as TFT size is decreased because total gate capacitance, gate to
source capacitance, and gate to drain capacitance can be minimized. The total gate capacitance should be small in order to
reduce the total capacitance of the address line (e.g., a scan line) that
control a row of TFTs in the imaging or display device. The charging
time of the address line is controlled by the product of the line
resistance and line capacitance. The total gate capacitance is added
to the line capacitance in determining the address line charging time.The gate to drain and gate to source capacitances,
respectively, should be small to minimize the coupling capacitance
between the input address line, which is connected to the gate, and
imaging or display element connected to the source or drain.A primary determinant of the gate to source and gate to
drain capacitances is the overlap of the source and drain electrodes,
respectively, over the gate electrode. Fabrication of small TFTs with
the source and drain electrodes aligned over the gate electrode can
be difficult. One reason is that photolithographic processes are
commonly used to pattern
