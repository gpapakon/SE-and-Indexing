A method of producing a material to be used as a bone 
substitute material or a means for anchoring 

endoprosthesis components, wherein the material 
comprises a polymer and/or copolymer and filler 

particles, wherein the polymer and/or copolymer 
component encompasses the filler particles at least 

partially and wherein the material is in the form of 
granules or fibres, the method comprising the following 

steps: 

preparing a plastic mixture of a polymer and/or 
copolymer powder and filler particles at a temperature 

below the temperature at which a complete liquefaction 
of the mixture occurs, 
extruding the plastic mass via at least one nozzle, 
and 
hardening the plastic mass and grinding it to obtain 
granules or drawing it to provide a fibre. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein initially a 
polymer and/or copolymer powder is homogeneously mixed 

with filler particles and the mixture is heated to a 
temperature at which it is at least in a plastic state. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the filler 
particles are heated separately from the polymer and/or 

copolymer powder and injected into the plastic polymer 
and/or copolymer component in a hot state under high 

pressure before, during or after the extrusion.  
 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the fibre is subsequently cut. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein 
heated filler particles are injected into the extruded 

fibres under pressure. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein 
conventional polymer and/or copolymer bead polymers 

without monomer are processed as the polymer and/or 
copolymer powder starting material, and/or wherein the 

material is based on an organic polymer, acrylate, 
methacrylate, polymethylmethacrylate and/or a copolymer 

thereof and/or an epoxy resin or a similar plastics 
material which can be used as a two-component plastics 

material. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein 
the filler particles and the polymer and/or copolymer 

powder are mixed at a ratio of 1 - 15 g of filler to 40 
g of powder, preferably 8 - 12 g of filler to 40 g of 

powder, or in a corresponding ratio in a larger 
quantity. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 7, wherein 
the mixture is heated to a temperature of up to 270°C, 

preferably less than 250°C, most preferably 130 to 
220°C, and/or wherein the extrusion through the nozzle 

is effected under high pressure of several bar, 
preferably more than 5 bar. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 8, wherein 
the granules are a mixture of particles having a size of 

1 to 160 µm, preferably 40 to 80 µm, wherein the granule 
particles are preferably polygonal, many-cornered or 

columnar and/or have another non-spherical shape.  
 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 9, wherein 
the filler particles are radiographic contrast agents, 

such as zirconium dioxide, bismuth compounds and/or 
barium sulfate, and/or wherein hydroxylapatite, 

tricalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate or other 
phosphate or carbonate derivatives, metals, such as 

magnesium or silicon compounds and/or aluminum ceramics 
are used as the filler particles, and/or wherein the 

filler particles have a particle size of between 1 and 15 
µm, preferably 3 to 10 µm, most preferably 5 µm. 
The method according to any of claims 1 to 10, wherein 
active ingredients are incorporated into the polymer 

and/or copolymer component or added to the granules or 
fibres, wherein the active ingredients are preferably 

antibiotics, wherein preferably gentamicin, clindamicin, 
lincomicin, streptomicin or similar antibiotic 

substances having a good releasability or combinations 
of these substances are used as the antibiotics, or 

wherein the active ingredients are bone morphogenetic 
protein (BMP), growth factors, growth-promoting 

substances on the basis of the growth hormone and/or 
metothrexate or another cytostatic agent. 
A material to be used as a bone substitute material or a 
means for anchoring endoprosthesis components, which 

comprises a polymer and/or copolymer and filler 
particles, wherein the polymer and/or copolymer 

component at least partially encompasses the filler 
particles, and the chains of the polymer and/or 

copolymer component are not cracked, and wherein the 
material is in the form of granules or fibers, the material 

being producible by means of a method according to any of 
claims 1 to 11.
