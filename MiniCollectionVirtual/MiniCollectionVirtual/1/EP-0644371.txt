<ABSTRACT>
A fuel tank carrier is formed from three parts -- a 
base (11), a handle (12), and a top ring (13). The base supports the 

bottom of 
a fuel tank bottle (48). The ring (13) is pivotally secured to the handle 

(12) and is pivotable between an upwardly extending loading position 
in which the fuel tank can be inserted into the base and a 

holding position in which the top ring encircles the fuel tank.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel tank carrier, and, 
more particularly, to a fuel tank carrier which is formed from 
three interconnected molded plastic parts. Propane is a commonly used fuel for lanterns, 
campstoves, soldering or brazing torches, etc. Propane fuel is 
usually contained in large, refillable tanks which hold about 20 
pounds of fuel and small, disposable tanks or bottles, which 
hold 14 or 16 ounces of fuel. The 14 and 16 ounce tanks are 
called bottles even though they are fabricated from metal. A conventional 14 ounce propane bottle is relatively 
long and narrow. The diameter of the bottle is about 3 inches, 
and the bottle can be easily gripped and carried by one hand. A conventional 16 ounce propane bottle is wider, having 
a diameter of about 4 inches. It is difficult or awkward to 
carry a 16 ounce bottle in one hand. Plumbers frequently use 16 ounce propane bottles for 
fueling torches for soldering or brazing joints. Plumbers have 
a particular need for a device which permits a 16 ounce propane 
bottle to be carried by one hand. However, such a carrying 
device could be used by anyone which uses 16 ounce propane 
bottles. Although 14 ounce propane bottles can be gripped 
relatively easily, the long, narrow bottle is relatively 
unstable. A device which could be used not only to carry the 
bottle but to provide stability would be advantageous. Other types of fuels, for example, butane, are also 
contained in disposable tanks. The invention provides an inexpensive, lightweight fuel 
tank carrier which enables the user to carry a fuel tank with 
one hand and which provides a stable support for the tank. The 
carrier is formed from three injection molded plastic parts --a  
 
base, a handle, and a top ring. The bottom of the handle snap 
fits into the base, and the top ring is pivotally secured to the 
top of the handle. The fuel tank is supported by the base, and 
the top ring pivots over the top of the tank to secure the tank 
to the carrier. The base provides a stable support for the fuel 
tank when the tank is not being carried. The invention will be explained in conjunction with an 
illustrative embodiment shown in the accompanying drawing, in 
which -- 
Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a fuel tank carrier 
formed in accordance with the invention; Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing a propane bottle 
being inserted into the carrier; Fig. 3 is a side elevational view, partially broken 
away, of the fuel tank carrier; Fig. 4 is a fragmentary top plan view of the fuel tank 
carrie

<CLAIMS>
A fuel tank carrier characterized by: 
   an annular base (11) having a cylindrical side wall 

(14) which provides a central opening which is sized to receive 
the diameter of a cylindrical fuel tank and bottom support means 

(17) extending radially inwardly from the side wall for 
supporting the bottom of the fuel tank, 

   a handle (12) secured to the side wall of the base and 
extending upwardly therefrom, the handle including a grip 

portion which extends generally parallel to the axis of the 
opening in the base and a top end portion, and 

   a top ring (13) pivotally secured to the top end 
portion of the handle, the top ring having a central opening 

which is sized to receive the diameter of a cylindrical fuel 
tank and being pivotable between a holding position in which the 

axis of the opening in the top ring is aligned with the axis of 
the opening in the base and a loading position which permits a 

fuel tank to be inserted into the base. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 1 further 
characterized by the axis of the opening in the top ring (13) in 

the loading position extending generally perpendicularly to the 
axis of the opening in the base (11). 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 1 further 
characterized by the top end of the handle (12) including a 

projection (44) which extends generally perpendicularly to the 
grip portion and which is received in a recess in the top ring, 

and a pivot pin (45) which extends through the top ring in the 
projection. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 3 further 
characterized by the top end of the handle including an abutment 

surface (46) which extends in a plane which is generally 
parallel to the axis of the opening in the base, the top ring 

 
including an abutment surface (39) which is engageable with the 

abutment surface (46) of the top end of the handle when the 
handle is in the holding position whereby the top ring is 

supported in a cantilever fashion. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 4 further 
characterized by a pivot pin (45) which pivotally connects the 

top ring and the top end of the handle, said abutment surfaces 
(46, 39) of the top ring and the top end of the handle being 

positioned between the pivot pin and the base. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 1 further 
characterized by the top end of the handle including an abutment 

surface (46) which extends in a plane which is generally 
parallel to the axis of the opening in the base, the top ring 

including an abutment surface (39) which is engageable with the 
abutment surface (46) of the top end of the handle when the 

handle is in the holding position whereby the top ring is 
supported in a cantilever fashion. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 6 further 
characterized by a pivot pin (45) which pivotally connects the 

top ring and the top end of the handle, said abutment surfaces 
(46, 39) of the top ring and the top end of the handle being 

positioned between the pivot pin and the base. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 1 further 
characterized by the base including an outer cylindrical wall 

(15) which surrounds said first-mentioned cylindrical side wall 
(14) and is spaced therefrom and a top wall (16) which connects 

the outer wall and the first wall, the handle including a bottom 
end portion (20) which is inserted into the space between the 

outer wall and the first wall. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 8 further 
characterized by the bottom end portion (20) of the handle 

includes a first radially inwardly extending shoulder (29) which 
extends through an opening in the first wall (14) and which is 

 
engageable with the first wall to prevent rotation of the handle 

relative to the base in the first direction and a second 
shoulder (30) which extends through an opening in the top wall 

(16) and which is engageable with the top wall to prevent 
rotation of the handle relative to the base in a second 

direction. 
The fuel tank carrier of claim 9 further 
characterized by the bottom end portion of the handle including 

a third projection (31) which extends through an opening in the 
bottom support means (17) of the base.
