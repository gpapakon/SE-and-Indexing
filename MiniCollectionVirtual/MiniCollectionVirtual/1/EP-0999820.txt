<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to oral and dental hygiene products consisting of aqueous, aqueous-alcoholic or anhydrous preparations containing an active combination of a water-soluble potassium or strontium salt and eugenol or oil of cloves, for desensitizing sensitive teeth. Said combination contains preferably at least 0.5 wt. % potassium or strontium ions, e.g. in the form of the nitrate, and at least 0.01 wt. % eugenol, preferably in the form of oil of cloves. Desensitizing toothpastes contain an additional 5-50 wt. % of a polishing agent, 1 wt. % thereof being dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and 10-60 wt. % being a humectant, and preferably 0.1-0.5 wt. % magnesium in the form of a dissolved salt and 0.2-2 wt. % monofluorophosphate.
