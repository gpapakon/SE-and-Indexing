<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a sucrose fatty acid ester 
wherein the sucrose fatty acid ester is recovered from a 

reaction mixture prepared by reacting sucrose with a fatty 
acid alkyl ester in the presence of an alkali catalyst by 

using dimethyl sulfoxide as a reaction solvent, the process 
comprising: (i) subjecting the reaction mixture to a first 

liquid-liquid extraction by using a hardly water-miscible 
organic solvent, which is selected from an alcohol having at 

least 4 carbon atoms and a ketone having at least 4 carbon 
atoms, and water as extractants, with regulating the pH value 

of the aqueous phase to 3 to 7.5, to thereby extract dimethyl 
sulfoxide in the reaction mixture into the aqueous phase, and 

the sucrose fatty acid ester into an organic solvent phase; 
(ii) subjecting the organic solvent solution containing the 

sucrose fatty acid ester thus obtained as the organic solvent 
phase in the first liquid-liquid extraction to a second 

liquid-liquid extraction by a continuous counter-current 
system using water, to thereby extract dimethyl sulfoxide 

remaining in the organic solvent solution into the aqueous 
phase, thus giving an organic solvent solution which is 

substantially free from dimethyl sulfoxide; and (iii) 
recovering the sucrose fatty acid ester from the organic 

solvent solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing a
sucrose fatty acid ester (hereinafter referred to simply as
SE). More particularly, it relates to an industrial
purification process by which an SE having a high purity can
be industrially advantageously and stably obtained from a
reaction mixture containing the SE, which has been prepared
by the solvent method.SE has been employed as additives for various
products including foods, cosmetics, drugs, dish detergents,
feeds and resins, because of its excellent surface-activating
performance, biodegradability and stability. In the field of
the chemical industry, these compounds are highly useful as
reaction aids in, for example, polymerization and
oxidization.Examples of a known method for producing an SE
include one described in JP-B-35-13102 (the term "JP-B" as
used herein means an "examined Japanese patent publication"),
wherein sucrose undergoes an ester exchange reaction with a
fatty acid ester such as a fatty acid methyl ester in a
reaction solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl
sulfoxide (hereinafter referred to simply as DMSO) in the
presence of an alkali catalyst. The reaction mixture obtained by the above-mentioned
method contains the reaction solvent, the unreacted sucrose
and the alkali catalyst in addition to the SE product.
There have been proposed several methods for separating the
SE from this mixture (as described e.g. in JP-B-48-21927,
JP-B-48-35049, JP-A-50-29417, JP-A-50-130712; the term
"JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese
patent application"). Usually, the mixture is subjected to
liquid-liquid extraction with the use of an organic solvent
(for example, hexane, butyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone,
ethyl isobutyl ketone) and water. Thus the SE migrates
mainly into the organic solvent phase, while the unreacted
sucrose and the reaction solvent migrate into the aqueous
phase. The organic solvent phase is then separated from the
aqueous phase and the organic solvent is removed from the
organic solvent phase containing the SE by, for example,
distillation. Thus the SE can be recovered.The preparation of pure SE is also dealt with in GB-A-0826801,
US-A-3054789, JP-A-4-243890, JP-A-51-029417, JP-A-50-105610
and JP-A-57-128 652.However the above-mentioned method can hardly be put
into industrial use, because it suffers from a number of
problems including the occurrence of hydrolysis of the SE in
the liquid-liquid extraction, the migration of the SE into
the aqueous phase, and the insufficient formation of
