<ABSTRACT>
A device for automatically milking animals, such as 
cows, comprises a milking parlour (1) and a computer controlled 

milking unit (29) with teat cups (52). The teat cups (52) 
are automatically connectable to the teats of an animal to be 

milked. Further, a computer controlled cleaning and/or drying 
unit (28) for the teats of the animal is provided. In a non-operativve 

position the milking unit (29) and the cleaning 
and/or drying unit (28) are located beside one another with 

respect to the length direction of the milking parlour (1), 
while, in turn, the milking unit (29) and the cleaning and/or 

drying unit (28) can be moved under the udder of the animal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for automatically
milking animals, such as cows, comprising a milking
parlour and a computer-controlled milking unit with a milking cluster with
teat cups which is automatically connectable to the
teats of an animal to be milked, and a computer-controlled
cleaning and/or drying unit for the teats of the animal.Such a device is known from EP-A-0 091 892.
For the purpose of obtaining a favourable arrangement
of the milking unit and the cleaning and/or drying unit,
the device is characterized by the features of the characterizing
part of claim 1. In order to limit the freedom of
movement of the animal, guide means may be provided
in the milking parlour. The milking unit and the cleaning
and/or drying unit may be located in their non-operative
position outside an area bounded by the guide means.
This construction permits an arrangement wherein the
milking unit and the cleaning and/or drying unit are each
supported by a support, the supports being mounted
outside the area bounded by the guide means, particularly
on the floor. In a specific embodiment the supports
are mounted in such a way that the milking unit and the
cleaning and/or drying unit can approach the udder of
the animal from a side of the milking parlour between a
foreleg and a hindleg of the animal.Further, according to the invention, a support
may comprise supporting arms hingeably connected to
each other, one of said supporting arms further being
hingeably connected to a height adjustable support
member mounted on the floor. The supporting arms
may be moved by means of a first, a second and a third
electric motor. This third electric motor may cooperate
with a spindle to realize the height adjustability of the
supporting arms. All the said electric motors may be
controlled by the computer.For a better understanding of the invention an
embodiment of the device for milking animals will now
be described with reference to the accompanying drawing.

<CLAIMS>
A device for automatically milking animals, such as
cows, comprising a milking parlour (1) and a computer

controlled milking unit (29) with a milking cluster with teat cups (52)
which is automatically connectable to the teats of

an animal to be milked, and a computer controlled
cleaning and/or drying unit (28) for the teats of the

animal, 
characterized in that
 the cleaning and/or
drying unit (28) can spray a fluid against the teats

and that in a non-operative position the milking unit
(29) and the cleaning and/or drying unit (28) are

located opposite to one another on opposing lateral
sides of the milking parlour (1), while, in turn, the

milking unit (29) and the cleaning and/or drying unit
(28) can be moved under the animal.
A device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that

in order to limit the freedom of movement of the animal,
guide means (27) are provided in the milking

parlour (1).
A device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that

the milking unit (29) and the cleaning and/or drying
unit (28) in their non-operative position are located

outside an area bounded by the guide means (27).
A device as claimed in claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in
that
 the milking unit (29) and the cleaning and/or
drying unit (28) are each supported by a support

(17), the supports (17) being mounted outside an
area bounded by the guide means (27).
A device as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that

the supports (17) are mounted on the floor.
A device as claimed in claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in
that
 the supports (17) are mounted in such a way
that the milking unit (29) and the cleaning and/or

drying unit (28) can approach the udder of the animal
from a side of the milking parlour (1) between a

foreleg and a hindleg of the animal.
A device as claimed in any one of the claims 4 - 6,

characterized in that
 a support (17) comprises supporting
arms (40, 41) hingeably connected to each

other, one of said supporting arms (40) further
being hingeably connected to a height adjustable

support member mounted on the floor.
A device as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized in that
