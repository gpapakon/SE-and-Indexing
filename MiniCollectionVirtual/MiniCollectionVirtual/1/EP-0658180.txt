<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates generally to paints and paint bases, and, more specifically to a process for providing in-situ generation of copper pyrithione biocide in a paint or paint base which comprises incorporating a compound of pyrithione, cuprous oxide and a controlled amount of water into the paint or paint base either during of after formulation of the paint or paint base.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
a process for generating copper pyrithione biocide in-situ in a paint
formulation.Pyrithiones (2-mercaptopyridine-N-oxide. salts thereof, and bis-2,2' derivatives)
are known to be excellent biocides in paint formulations. Combinations of zinc pyrithione
and cuprous oxide are known to be excellent antifouling agents when formulated into
paints and paint bases (i.e., the paint before pigment addition) also containing rosin, as
disclosed, for example, in US Patent No. 5,057,153. Unfortunately, however, such paints
may have a limited service life due to leaching of the biocide from the paint film during
use.US 5,098,473 (Hani et al) describes a process for providing stable gel free
dispersions of zinc pyrithione plus cuprous oxide in a paint which is gelation inhibited.
due to the zinc pyrithione having a purity assay of at least 98%. US 5,112,397 (Farmer
Jr. et al) describes processes for providing stable gel free dispersions of zinc pyrithione
plus cuprous oxide biocide in paints by incorporating in the paint base an amine
compound or esterified wood rosin to impart gelation inhibition, US 5,137,569 (Waldron
et al) describes processes for providing stable gel free dispersions of zinc pyrithione plus
cuprous oxide biocide in paints by incorporating a metal salt of wood rosin to impart
gelation inhibition.Copper pyrithione is known to have lower solubility in water than zinc pyrithione.
Such low solubility would provide an extended period of antimicrobial activity for copper
pyrithione relative to zinc pyrithione during use. Unfortunately, copper pyrithione is not
commercially available, possibly due to the fact that its manufacture is surprisingly more
difficult than the readily available zinc pyrithione, sodium pyrithione and bis-2,2'-pyrithione
and its adduct with magnesium sulfate. The present invention overcomes this
problem of lack of commercial availability of copper pyrithione by providing for the
generation of 
copper pyrithione in-situ in the paint formulation
through the reaction of another pyrithione compound with
cuprous oxide in the presence of a controlled amount of
water. Such a solution would be highly desired by the
paint manufacturing community.Thus, the present invention provides a solution
to the problem. Although individually cuprous oxide,
copper pyrithione and other pyrithione compounds are all
known biocides, the use of a combination of a pyrithione
compound and cuprous oxide in the presence of a
controlled amount of water in order to
