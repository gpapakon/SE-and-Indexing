<ABSTRACT>
The aperture setting apparatus for the 
illumination system of a film telecine scanner 

comprises a housing 
containing a continuous, single piece, elongated band (233) 

having first and second centrally disposed light 
obstructing or solid band sections (235,237) formed in parallel 

planes with respect to one another and first and second 
cut-out band sections separating 

the first and second light obstructing band sections and 
forming end loops (239₁,239₂,241₁,241₂) 

of the elongated band, the first and 
second shaped leading edges (235',237') 

formed as edges of the first 
and second light obstructing band sections defining one 

side of the first and second respective light 
transmitting band sections which face one another and 

interrupt the light beam in near the same plane as the 
first and second light obstructing band sections are 

moved in parallel with respect to one another and the 
opening. A motor drive assembly supported by the housing 

engages and provide rotational driving force to the end 
loop of the second light transmitting section. 

A position sensor provides a position feedback 
signal to the illumination control system for providing 

servo regulation of the positioning of the aperture 
defining leading edges of the band.

Patent entitled
"Illumination Control System for a Film Scanner" filed on
even date herewith.Field of the Invention--This invention relates to an
electro-mechanical aperture setting apparatus capable of
rapid, precise changes in aperture setting, and
particularly to an aperture setting system suitable for
regulating the illumination level in a light beam of a
telecine scanner that is capable of a dynamic range of
operation to a specified illumination level within the
time allotted for scanning a film frame.Description of the Prior Art--State of the art
illumination systems for telecine film scanners typically
include a light-sensitive, charge-coupled device (CCD)
linear array which provides a serial output representing
a line of a television raster and a light source for
illuminating a linear section of the film being scanned
with either a scanning light beam or a line of diffuse
light. For color television, one version of a film
scanner can include a light source that is subjected to
dichroic filtration to tailor the spectral content of the
light according to the film to be scanned and directed
into a light integrator which forms a line of diffuse
light for illumination of the film frame. The line of
light must be sufficiently uniform in intensity and
diffusion along its length and have the red, green and
blue spectral radiance for the film being scanned. The
film is held in a cylindrical shape and moved past the
line of diffuse light. The light passing through the 
illuminated linear section is color and intensity
modulated by the image therein and imaged onto three
color filtered CCD arrays as described, for example, in
commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,012,346 to DeJager
et al. and 5,003,379 to Moore, Jr. et al.The film motion provides the vertical (frame) scan,
and the linear, synchronized electronic cycling of the
CCD arrays provides the horizontal (line) scan of a
rasterized television signal with both chrominance and
luminance components. A number of the considerations
taken into account in scanning positive or print and
negative color film stocks with such telecine film
scanners is set forth in the article "Optical scanning
system for a CCD telecine for HDTV" by Kurtz et al. in
SPIE, vol. 1448 Camera and Input Scanner Systems, 1991,
pp. 191-205.As described in that article and in commonly
assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 4,868,383 and 5,155,596, to
Kurtz et al, and 5,012,346, to DeJager et al, such film
scanner linear light sources have
