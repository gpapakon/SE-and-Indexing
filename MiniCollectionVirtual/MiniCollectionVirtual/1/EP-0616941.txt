<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement can be used to avoid self-opening of a door or cover which is not correctly closed and locked, in an aircraft fuselage. It makes an efficient contribution to improving flight safety in aircraft. The arrangement consists of a door monitoring system (1) which is connected to a cabin pressure regulating device (4) and/or to a cabin temperature regulating device (5) and/or to an air tapping device (36), the regulating devices (4; 5; 36) providing suitable physical additional information from the interior of the fuselage of the aircraft (1). The latter have at least one connection which provides information to determine the aircraft operating mode.

Arrangement for preventing the automatic opening of a 
door or flap in the aircraft fuselage (35) which is not 

properly closed and locked, having a door-monitoring 
system (1) which is in communication with certain 

regulating devices that supply appropriate physical 
condition data from the interior of the fuselage of the 

aircraft (34), wherein the door-monitoring system (1) and 
the regulating devices are disposed at a suitable point 

in the aircraft fuselage (35), the door-monitoring system 
(1) consisting of a door-monitoring regulating device (2) 

and a number of sensors (3) that are installed in the 
fuselage doors of the aircraft (34), each fuselage door 

being associated with at least one sensor (3), which 
sensors, in the event of there being more than one sensor 

(3), are combined to form a sensor unit (3n) and are 
connected to the door-monitoring regulating device (2), 

the functional composition of which has at least one 
channel, and wherein the sensors (3) or sensor units (3n) 

associated with the fuselage doors detect the overall 
status of the fuselage doors by measurement techniques 

and pass it to the channels of the door-monitoring 
regulating device (2), all connections being made in an 

electrically and/or optically conductive manner and by 
means of signal lines, 
characterized in that
 the door-monitoring 
regulating device (2) is connected, on the 

output side, to a cabin pressure-regulating device (4) 
and/or to a cabin temperature-regulating device (5) 

and/or to a tap air-regulating device (36), and that at 
least one connection, which supplies data for determining 

the flight operating condition, is connected to the cabin 
pressure-regulating device (4) and/or to the cabin 

temperature-regulating device (5) and/or to the tap air-regulating 
device (36). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the cabin pressure-regulating device (4) is composed of a 

first and a second cabin pressure-regulator (8; 9), and  
 

that a front outlet valve (10) is connected in parallel 
with the one output of the first cabin pressure-regulator 

(8) and with the one output of the second cabin pressure-regulator 
(9), and a rear outlet valve (11) is connected 

in parallel with the other output of the first cabin 
pressure-regulator (8) and with the other output of the 

second cabin pressure-regulator (9), wherein the two 
inputs of the cabin pressure-regulators (8; 9) are run, 

by means of lines, to a first nodal point (16) associated 
with a signal line (23) and to a second nodal point (17) 

associated with another signal line (22), which nodal 
points are connected to a third nodal point (18) 

associated with the one signal line (23) and to a fourth 
nodal point (19) associated with the other signal line 

(22), and are applied to the two channel outputs of the 
door-monitoring regulating device (2). 
Arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 
the cabin temperature-regulating device (5) is composed 

of a first and a second cabin temperature-regulator (12; 
13) and that a first through-flow regulating valve (14) 

is connected in parallel with the one output of the first 
cabin temperature-regulator (12) and with the one output 

of the second cabin temperature-regulator (13), and a 
second through-flow regulating valve (15) is connected in 

parallel with the other output of the first cabin 
temperature-regulator (12) and with the other output of 

the second cabin temperature-regulator (13), wherein the 
two inputs of the cabin temperature-regulators (12; 13) 

are run, by means of lines, to a fifth nodal point (20) 
associated with the one signal line (23) and to a sixth 

nodal point (21) associated with the other signal line 
(22), which nodal points are connected to a third nodal 

point (18) associated with the one signal line (23) and 
to a fourth nodal point (19) associated with the other 

signal line (22), and are applied to the two channel 
outputs of the door-monitoring regulating device (2).

 one connection (24, 25, 26, 27, 37) in each case, 
via which appropriate data for determining the flight
