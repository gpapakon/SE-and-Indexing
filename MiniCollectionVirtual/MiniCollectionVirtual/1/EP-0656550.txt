<ABSTRACT>
An integrated optics polarisation state converter comprises optically 
in series a first TM₀ to TM₁ mode converter that is substantially 

transparent to TE₀, a concatenation of total internal reflectors (34a, 
34b, 34c 
&
 34d), and a second TM₀ to TM₁ converter, similarly 
substantially transparent to TE₀, which is connected the way round 

so as to operate as a TM₁ to TM₀ converter. Each TM₀ to TM₁ 
converter may comprise a tandem arrangement of a 2 x 2 TE₀/TM₀ 

polarisation beam splitting coupler and a mismatched, 3dB 
maximum, 2 x 2 beam splitting coupler. The place of the TM₀ to 

TM₁ converters substantially transparent to TE₀ may be taken by 
TE₀ to TE₁ converters substantially transparent to TM₀.

<DESCRIPTION>
In a variety of optical applications there is a need to convert light of
one state of polarisation (SOP) into another. For instance, in a
coherent light optical transmission system there is typically a
requirement for at least one polarisation state controller to establish
a match at the receiver between the state of polarisation of the
information carrying signal and that of the local oscillator signal.
Polarisation control by means of one or more polarisation state
controllers may also form part of a transmission system that has a
transmission path that includes optically in a series a number of
optical amplifiers, the controllers being employed to take care of
polarisation dependent effects liable to be exhibited by such
amplifiers.In optical communications applications the light, whose SOP is to be
converted, is typically in zero order mode which, in an integrated
optics environment, is resolvable into TE0 and TM0 mode
components. In a zero order mode integrated optics environment
therefore a polarisation state converter receiving for instance a TE0
mode input signal, delivers from its output a signal having TE0 and
TM0 components.An example of such an integrated optics polarisation state converter
is described by P Albrecht et a in a paper entitled, "Integrated
Optical Polarisation Splitter", IEE Colloquium Polarisation Effects,
22nd October 1990. That converter relies upon a direct conversion
between TE0 and TM0 modes using an electrostatic field aligned at
right angles to the direction of propagation of light in a waveguide.
Conversion is relatively weak in this instance, and proceeds
cumulatively only whilst the TE0 and TM0 modes remain in mutual 
phase coherence. Because phase coherence is difficult to achieve
over the necessary lengths, specific and quite elaborate means
have had to be provided for compensating phase mismatch on
individual devices.The present invention is directed to a polarisation state converter
that avoids some of the problems associated with direct TE0/TM0
conversion by making the conversion, an indirect one from a zero
mode of one polarisation (TE0 or TM0) to a first order mode of the
other (TM1 or TE1), followed by a selective conversion of the first
order mode of that other polarisation (TM1 or TE1 ) into a zero order
mode of the same (other) polarisation (TM0 or TE0).According to the present invention there is provided an integrated
optics polarisation state converter that includes optically in series a
zero-to-first order mode converter and a concatenation of total
