<ABSTRACT>
A phase locked loop (20) includes a standby control circuit 
(30) and recovers from standby with minimum lock time. A 

reference counter (21), a loop counter portion (22, 23) and a phase 
detector (24) are disabled in response to an activation of a 

standby signal. Both the reference counter (21) and the loop 
counter portion (22, 23) are enabled in response to a deactivation 

of the standby signal. A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) (26) 
output signal is decoupled from an input of the loop counter 

portion (22, 23) in response to an activation of a loop counter 
output signal. The VCO output signal is next recoupled to the 

input of the loop counter portion (22, 23) in response to an 
activation of a reference counter output signal. Finally, the phase 

detector (24) is enabled. In one embodiment, the loop counter 
portion (22, 23) includes a prescaler (22) which does not have a 

separate reset input, and a separate loop counter (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to phase locked loops, and
more particularly, to standby methods and circuits for phase
locked loops.Phase locked loops (PLLs) have important uses in
communications applications. One such use, a PLL frequency
synthesizer, generates an output signal having a programmable
frequency to be used in tuning two or more communication
channels. A reference oscillator generates a reference signal
which is counted in a reference counter to provide a first input of
a phase detector. An output of a loop counter provides a second
input of the phase detector. The phase detector provides a
voltage indicative of whether the inputs thereof are in lock, i.e.
have the same phase and frequency. The phase detector output is
filtered in a loop filter such as an integrator, the output of which
provides an input to a voltage controller oscillator (VCO). The
output of the VCO, which is the output of the PLL frequency
synthesizer, is then divided in the loop counter. If a different
output frequency is desired, the user need only change the
starting counter value of the reference counter or the loop
counter, and the feedback loop of the PLL frequency synthesizer
causes the output frequency to quickly lock.In many applications, the output of the VCO has a relatively
large frequency in relation to the reference frequency. For
example, the VCO may be programmed to output a signal having a
frequency of 1.2 gigahertz (GHz). Because this frequency is too
high for division in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) circuitry, the loop counter is usually broken down into two
components: a prescaler, and a subsequent counter also referred
to as the loop counter. The prescaler can then be made with 
higher-speed bipolar circuitry, while the loop counter is implemented in
CMOS circuitry.Low power consumption is a key consideration in many products
using PLL frequency synthesizers. Thus, these products often place the
PLL frequency synthesizer in a standby mode to save power. While in
standby mode, the prescaler, counters, and phase detector are disabled
to save power. The input to the VCO remains substantially constant,
causing the VCO output to maintain approximately the same frequency
as before the PLL frequency synthesizer entered standby. This creates a
problem on exiting standby, however. During standby, the output of the
VCO may have drifted in phase, but not in frequency. Additionally,
when the counters are re-enabled, they are not synchronized and the
phase detector will detect a large error,
