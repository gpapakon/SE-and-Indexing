<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a kit for constructing a luminaire arrangement in which the luminaires 8 are firmly clamped in rails which have current conductors and are suspended from the ceiling. The kit comprises the combination of a rail constructed as a pair 1 of rails, suspension rods 10 serving to suspend the rails 2 from the ceiling 9, and a low-voltage transformer 12. The rails 2 have, one beside the other, two recesses 4, 5 which are open towards the same side of the rail member 3, there being arranged in the one recess 5 at a distance from one another and opposite one another two low-voltage current conductors 6, and the other recess 4 serving to mount luminaires 8 and the rails 2 on a rail connector 7.

A mounting unit of a lighting system, in which the
lamps (8) are clamped into rails arranged as a pair

of rails (1) having conductors, and are suspended
from a ceiling (9) by means of at least two

suspension rods (10), whereby at least one low-voltage
transformer (12) is provided as a means of

supplying the rails with power, characterised in
that the rails (2) of each pair of rails (1) have,

adjacent to one another, two open recesses (4, 5) to
the same side of the rail body (3) and two low-voltage

conductors (6) are arranged lying opposite
one another and at a distance apart from one another

in the one recess (5) and the other recess (4) is
used to retain lamps (8) and the rails (2) on a rail

connector (7), a rail connector (7) is arranged on
each of the end portions (11) of the suspension rods

(10) facing away from the ceiling (9) providing a
mounting connector for the rails (2), and the at

least one low-voltage transformer (12) can be
connected via pins (20) to the low-voltage

conductors in the rails (2).
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that two tongues (13) which reduce the cross-section

of recesses (4) are arranged parallel with
one another on the recesses (4) of the rails (2) and

can be engaged from the rear by the heads (14) of
bolts (15) arranged in a spacing ring (16) of each

rail connector (7).
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 2, characterised
in that two pins (17) of a rectangular cross-section

are arranged lying parallel with one another on 
spacing rings (16) and can be inserted in the

recesses (4) between the tongues (13).
A mounting unit as claimed in claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the spacing rings (16) of the

rail connector (7) can each be connected to the
suspension rods (10) by means of a screw (18) so as

to be height-adjustable.
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 4, characterised
in that an elastic collar (19) made from rubber or

similar is arranged respectively between spacing
ring (16) and suspension rod (10).
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that each recess (5) containing low-voltage

conductors (6) is connected via a contact-piece (21)
on a pin to a low-voltage transformer (12).
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 6, characterised
in that the rods (10) are adjustable in length and

are each connected to a low-voltage transformer (12)
or jointly to a low-voltage transformer (12).
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 7, characterised
in that the low-voltage transformer (12) or the low-voltage

transformers (12) is/are arranged in a
housing which can be joined to the ceiling (9).
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 7, characterised
in that the low-voltage transformer (12) can be

detachably secured in a ceiling (9) by means of
holders (24) and can be covered on the visible side

by means of a covering plate (23). 
A mounting unit as claimed in claim 9, characterised
in that the holders (24) are spring clamps (25).
A mounting unit as claimed in claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that each lamp (8) can be connected

to the pair of rails (1) by means of an adapter
(26), having lying one above the other and facing

one another two pins (27, 27; 28, 28), the upper of
which pins (27, 27) lie between the tongues (13)

engaging in the recesses (4) of the rails (2) whilst
the lower pins (28, 28) can be mounted as power

contact pins to the low-voltage conductors (6) in
the recesses (5) of the rails (2).
