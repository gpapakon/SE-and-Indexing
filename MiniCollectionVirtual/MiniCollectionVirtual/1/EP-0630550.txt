<ABSTRACT>
An electric immersion heating element for a water boiling vessel has associated therewith a single thermal sensor which protects the element against overheating due to its being switched on when dry and also serves to switch off the element when water boils in the vessel. The heating element is of traditional construction with a sheathed wire-wound element proper affixed to a head plate and with a hot-return portion of the element proper affixed to the head plate to enable the element temperature to be sensed on the opposite side of the head plate, but the element sheath and the head plate are formed of stainless steel (or another material having a low thermal conductivity as compared to copper or brass), the fixation of the element hot return portion to the head plate is by means of a spot weld (or another highly localized fixation), an enclosure is provided on the element head in the region thereof whereat the element hot return portion is affixed and is arranged so that water fills the enclosure when the vessel is filled but is expelled therefrom by steam generated by water boiling in the vessel, and the single thermal sensor is arranged to be in close thermal contact with a highly localized area of the head plate corresponding to the location whereat the element hot return portion is affixed thereto on the opposite side thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements relating to
controls for electrically heated water boiling vessels
such as electric kettles and hot water jugs and also
including pots, pans, urns, laboratory equipment etc.
Whilst the present invention has particular
application to electric kettles and hot water jugs and
will be described in the following with reference to
such application, it is not limited to such an
application.Automatic electric kettles and hot water jugs are
conventionally provided with two thermal controls,
namely an element protector control adapted to switch
off the supply of power to the electric heating
element of the appliance in a sensed overtemperature
situation resulting from the appliance being switched
on empty for example, and a steam control for reducing
or switching off the supply of power to the heating
element when the water being heated boils, Such
controls generally have their own thermal sensors, 
commonly a bimetallic element, and the element
protector control may further include some form of
secondary or back-up protection arranged to operate in
the event, however unlikely, of failure of the primary
control. An exemplary element protector control is
the X1 control manufactured by Otter Controls Ltd. and
substantially as described in GB-A-2194099 with
reference particularly to Figs. 3A, 3B and 3C thereof,
and an exemplary steam control is the J1 control
manufactured by Otter Controls Ltd. and substantially
as described in GB-A-2212664 with reference
particularly to Figs. 3A to 3M thereof.A single sensor electronic control for a water
boiling vessel is described in GB-A-2228634. This
control utilizes a thermistor and senses element
temperature as a function of the electrical resistance
of the thermistor and the onset of boiling as a
function of the rate of change of the thermistor
resistance. However, even with the current state of
modern electronics a circuit capable of switching a
mains load cannot readily be manufactured at a price
competitive with bimetallic controls.A single sensor control is proposed in GB-A-1 143
834 (Matsushita) but has never been manufactured, so
far as we are aware. According to this proposal, a
sheathed, insulated, resistance heating element 
mounted to a head plate, providing for mounting of the
element in a kettle or other water boiling vessel, has
the heating element proper bent to define a hot return
portion which is attached to the element head plate at
a location above the general level of the major part
of the heating element, and an

<CLAIMS>
An electric heating element for a water boiling vessel, the element comprising a
head plate (1) and a sheathed heating element proper (2) having a hot return

portion (3) affixed to the head plate, the head plate (1) and the sheath of the
element proper (2) being formed of a material having a low thermal conductivity as

compared to copper or brass and the hot return portion (3) of the element proper
being affixed to the head plate by means of a highly localized fixation (6) such as to

concentrate the heat from the hot return portion (3) of the heating element to a very
restricted region of the head plate (1) in the immediate vicinity of said highly

localized fixation (6), and an enclosure (7) provided around the hot return portion
(3), the enclosure being such as to admit water thereto when a vessel fitted with the

element (1) is filled and such that water will be expelled therefrom by steam
generation when the water is boiled, the arrangement being such that, in use of the

heating element in a vessel and with a thermal sensor (5) arranged to be responsive
to the temperature of the element head plate (1) at a highly localized region of the

side thereof which is opposite to the side whereto the hot return portion (3) of the
element proper (2) is affixed and corresponds to the location of said highly

localized fixation (6), the sensor (5) will operate to switch off the heating element
when water boils in the vessel in the same way as it would operate to switch off the

heating element if it were to be turned on without any water in the vessel because
the boiling of water in the vessel and steam generation within the enclosure (7) will 

expel water therefrom whereupon the hot return portion (3) of the heating element
will overheat and cause the sensor (5) to operate.
An electric heating element as claimed in claim 1 wherein the head plate (1)
and the sheath of the element proper (2) are formed of stainless steel or of a nickel-silver

or cupro-nickel alloy.
An electric heating element as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
highly localized fixation (6) of the hot return portion (3) of the element proper (2)

to the head plate (1) comprises a spot weld.
An electric heating element as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein the highly
localized fixation (6) of the hot return portion (3) of the element proper (2) to the

head plate (1) comprises a high thermal conductivity link passing through the head
plate.
An electric heating element as claimed in any of the preceding claims
wherein the enclosure (7) is such that water is admitted thereto substantially only at

the points where the sheathed heating element proper (2) passes through the walls
of the enclosure (7). 
An electric heating element as claimed in any of the preceding claims having
a thermal sensor (5) arranged to be responsive to the temperature of the element

head plate (1) at a highly localized region of the side thereof which is opposite to
the side whereto the hot return portion (3) of the element proper (2) is affixed and

corresponds to the location of said highly localized fixation (6).
An electric heating element as claimed in claim 6 wherein said thermal
sensor (5) comprises a bimetallic element.
An electric heating element as claimed in claim 7 wherein the bimetallic element
(5) is located closely adjacent to the element head plate (1) with a small quantity of

heat sink compound thermally coupling said highly localized region (6) of the head
plate (1) to the bimetallic element (5).
An electric heating element as claimed in claim 6 or 7 or 8 wherein said
thermal sensor (5) is arranged to be responsive to a predetermined temperature at

said highly localized region (6) of the element head plate (1) to switch off the
supply of power to the heating element.
An electrically heated water boiling vessel having a heating element as
claimed in any of claims 6 to 9.
