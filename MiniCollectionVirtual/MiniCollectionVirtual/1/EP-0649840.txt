<ABSTRACT>
Cyclopropane derivatives of the following general formula 
(I) or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are provided, 

as well as anti-viral agents containing the same as the active 
ingredient: 


wherein R¹ and R², which may be the same or different, each 
represents a hydrogen atom or an acyl group; R³ represents a 

halogen atom, a 2-haloalkyl group, a 2-halo-1-alkenyl group, 
or a 1-alkynyl group. The derivatives and their salts have 

anti-viral activity, for example against varicella zoster and 
herpes simplex, and may be used as alternatives to acyclovir. And 

intermediates of formulae (3) and (9) 

wherein R₄ is a protective group for a hydroxyl group and R₃ is defined as 
above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cyclopropane
derivatives having an anti-viral activity especially
effective against varicella-zoster viruses and herpes
simplex viruses, and also to anti-viral agents containing
the same.Varicella-zoster viruses cause varicella in infants
with high fever and cause zoster in adults with much pain
such as neuralgia, etc. Some anti-viral agents such as
acyclovir and the like are used but are not always
satisfactory in view of their pharmaceutical potency and
unfavourable side-effect (Am. J. Med., 85, (Suppl. 2A),
116-122 (1988), JP-A-56/87599, JP-A-5/78357).Embodiments of the present invention desirably
provide compounds having high anti-viral potency against
varicella-zoster virus and having high safety.EP-A-0 484 843 discloses an optically active
cyclobutyl pyrimidine, in which the pyrimidine nucleus
carries a 2-bromoethenyl group at the 5 position. The
compound is active against herpes simplex virus 1 and
varicella-zoster virus.J. Med. Chem. (1992), 35(10), pp1799-1806 relates to
cyclobutyl compounds carrying a halovinyluracil group.
The compounds are said to have excellent activity against
varicella-zoster virus.EP-A-0 502 690 discloses cyclopropane derivatives
for use as antivirals. Some of these are thymine
derivatives, in which the pyrimidine nucleus has a methyl 
group at the 5 position.J. Med. Chem. (1988), 31(11), pp2304-2315 describes
the synthesis and antiherpetic activity of 9-[[(Z)-2-(hydroxymethyl)
cyclopropyl]methyl] guanine and related
compounds. Some compounds include thymine in place of
guanine.EP-A-0 291 230 discloses 1-[2,
(hydroxymethyl)cycloalkylmethyl]-5-substituted uracils
as inhibitors of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase
inhibitors. In each case the cycloalkyl group is a
cyclobutyl group or larger ring.EP-A-0 458 363 discloses fluorinated cyclobutyl
compounds in which the ring carries either a purine or
pyrimidyl residue. The compounds are antivirals.The present inventors have found that the following
cyclopropane derivatives have an excellent anti-viral
activity against varicella-zoster viruses and herpes
simplex viruses:
(i) 1-[1'S,2'R-bis(hydroxymethyl)cyclopropan-1'-yl]
methyl-5-[(E)-2-chloroethenyl]-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione;(ii) 1-[1'S, 2'R-bis (hydroxymethyl)cyclopropan-1'-yl]
methyl-5-[(E)-2-bromoethenyl]-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione;(iii) 1-[1'S, 2'R-bis (hydroxymethyl)cyclopropan-1'-yl]
methyl-5-[(E)-2-iodoethenyl]-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione;(iv) 1-[1'α,
