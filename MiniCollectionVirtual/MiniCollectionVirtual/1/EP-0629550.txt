<ABSTRACT>
In a film packaging machine wherein a pair of sealing 
bars (26) are caused to move linearly with a film (F) so 

as to increase the sealing cycle time, a pair of control 
belts (30) are mounted so as to reciprocate in unison 

with said sealing bars. The control belts (30), which 
are oriented vertically at opposite edges of a central 

product conveyor (24) and adapted to grip a product being 
wrapped, are rotated from a drive apparatus mounted to 

the machine body at a speed which equals the linear speed 
of reciprocation. Thus, the control belts (30) do not 

rotate when the reciprocating motion is in the same 
direction as the direction in which the film and product 

move, and rotate at double the linear speed of 
reciprocation when the reciprocating motion is in the 

opposite direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to packaging machines
incorporating conveyor apparatus and particularly to
packaging machines used for packaging of products in film
wrap. A machine as defined by the features indicated in the preamble
of claim 1 is known from US-A-4 313 288.A commonly used method of packaging items for sale
involves wrapping the item in a sheet of film and sealing
the film around the item. This method has been
commercially employed for the packaging of food items,
such as, for example, poultry products. In many
industrial horizontal packaging machines, the poultry
product is fed into a longitudinally sealed tube formed
of the film wrap and then the tube is sealed transversely
ahead of and behind the poultry product. This sealing is
typically done by thermal or ultrasonic welding
techniques using sealing bars.As wrapping equipment has been made to operate faster, it
has become necessary to modify the manner of conveying
the poultry product, frequently transported in a tray, in
order to maintain firm control of the product during
packaging and also during weighing and labelling
operations. One means of improving the control comprises 
the use of vertical conveyor belts placed so as to engage
opposite sides of the tray to enhance the synchronization
of the product tray motion with the machine motions.
See, for example, US-A-5,137,099 with
respect to use of vertical control belts in a weighing
and labelling operation.In order to improve the process speed and to maintain
reliable film seals, there has been developed a mechanism
able to cause the sealing bars which form the transverse
seals to travel along with the film, and thus increase
the seal cycle time. Such a mechanism is disclosed in
JP-A-4,121,444 for Packaging
Machine Seal Mechanism and Control by Suga filed April
15, 1992.In addition to the inherent problems associated with
handling trays of poultry at high production speeds, the
air within the wrapper is often evacuated so that a
minimum of air is available within the wrap. This
reduced quantity of air retards the natural degradation
of the poultry, thus preserving it in useful condition
for a longer time. However, the vacuuming needed to
remove the air is powerful and rapid, and tends to pull
the poultry toward the vacuum source. Since the most
effective time to apply this vacuum is at the last 
instant before completing sealing of the package, the
vacuum attempts to pull the poultry product from the
partially sealed package.In Applicant's copending application entitled "PACKAGING
MACHINE

<CLAIMS>
A packaging machine comprising:

a) means for feeding products to a belt conveyor
apparatus for packaging said products, said apparatus

including at least one belt conveyor (30,110,150) for
