<ABSTRACT>
The identification tag is interrogated by an interrogation/evaluation device which wirelessly transmits an interrogation signal to the identification tag. The interrogation/evaluation device then evaluates a reply signal which is returned from the tag. At least one reflector(s) of the ID-tag reflectors (4, 5) can be electrically switched over in its reflection. The switchable reflector is connected to a switch (7) which is operated by sensors (8). In one embodiment the switch is a sensor-operated bistable switch element.
