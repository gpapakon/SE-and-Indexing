<ABSTRACT>
In the bottom part, a pneumatic deep-hole hammer (10) has an outer tube (55), a control-housing shell (60) together with non-return valve (59), and a central tube (80) which has radial passages (81, 83) and on which a percussion piston (75) slides. The head of an axially displaceable drill bit (90) can be slipped onto the bottom end (84) of the central tube. A cylinder liner (70) guiding the piston (75) and the control-housing shell (60) are circumferentially welded to the outer tube (55) over an axial area (welding zone S, length l). Sitting above them is an adapter (40) which has top air passages (42), carries a blast ring (50) with nozzles (53) directed upwards, and is connected in a drive-transmitting manner to a sleeve (15) either directly or via a sliding piece (30) with guided shaft (20), which sleeve (15) sits under the connection cap (11). The bottom end (23) of the shaft (20) forms a control slide relative to the adapter top part (41), from which passages (42, 47) lead to a control-housing chamber (62) with passages (63). An annular chamber (68) follows below a tubular body (61) between outer tube (55) and cylinder liner (70). The free cross-section of the annular chamber (68) corresponds to the narrowest central bore (12, 22, 32, 42/47, 62, 82, 92) in the through components (11, 20, 30, 40, 61, 80, 87/90). Bores, passages and grooves (71, 72; 81, 83) in cylinder liner (70) and central tube (80) interact in a motion-controlling manner with recesses (76, 76') and bores (78, 78') of the piston (75).
