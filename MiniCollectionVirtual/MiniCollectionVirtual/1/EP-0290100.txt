<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a nickel upon transition alumina 
catalyst containing 5-40% ww of nickel, with an active 

nickel surface area between 80 and 300 m²/g of Ni, 
with a transition alumina that satisfies the following 

X-ray diffraction pattern: 

 
Preferably, the BET total surface area of the catalyst 

is between 50 and 200 m²/g catalyst and is 
substantially free from pores with a radius below 2.0 

nm. 
Also, a process is provided for hydrotreating 
unsaturated hydrocarbons, in which unsaturated 

hydrocarbons are treated with hydrogen in the presence 
of a catalyst as defined above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a nickel upon transition 
alumina catalyst, and more in particular to such a 
catalyst with a nickel content of 5-40% ww and an 
active nickel surface area between 80 and 300 m²/g of 
nickel. Many catalysts are of the type of a metal which has 
been dispersed as the active phase on a carrier or 
support material and, confining ourselves to petroleum 
chemistry, many carrier materials have been proposed. 
In the Oil and Gas Journal of October 5 (1987), pages 
41-78, the following supports have been named: alumina, 
gamma-alumina, alpha-alumina, zinc aluminate, calcium 
aluminate, magnesium aluminate, alumina-molybdenum 
oxide, amorphous and crystalline silica-aluminas, 
molecular sieves/zeolites, zeolite-aluminas, 
kieselguhr/diatomaceous earth, activated carbon, 
polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, pumice and 
sepiolite. More specifically, nickel upon transition alumina and, 
more in particular, gamma-alumina are known from 
US-A-4 490 480 (Octropa B.V.). These catalysts, 
however, have a relatively small pore radius and not a 
very high active nickel surface area. Consequently, 
with substrate material of a high molecular weight 
transport (intra-particle diffusion limitation) 
problems occur so that the active nickel area is not 
completely available for hydrogenation reaction. US-A-4 081 353 (Kehl et al.) discloses a process for 
the hydrodesulphurisation of a sulphur-containing 
charge-stock, using a catalyst comprising 2-25 weight  
 
percent of a metalliferous hydrogenation component on 
an alumina hydrate with x-ray diffraction peaks at 2 
theta = 14° and, judging from the figures in this 
patent, 2 theta = about 28° and 38°. This pattern is 
typical for AlOOH, i.e. boehmite(ZCPPS file 21-1307). 
The peak at 2 = 14° is the most intense peak in the x-­
ray diffractogramme of the boehmite; this peak is not 
found in the x-ray diffractogramme of theta-alumina. GB-A-1 528 413 (Batty et al.) discloses a process for 
the production of white oils of DAB 7 quality (DAB = 
Deutsche Pharmakopoeia, 7th Ed.). Especially the second 
stage hydrogenation process described is interesting. 
In this process, applying a nickel-containing catalyst 
supported on sepiolite is used. Sepiolite is a 
naturally occurring mineral (which can also be prepared 
via a synthetic route), mainly consisting of magnesium 
silicate. US-A-4 495 307 (Clements et al.) discloses catalytic 
particles shaped as a cylinder of polylobate cross-­
section having bluntly rounded, concave, interlobar 
interstices.
