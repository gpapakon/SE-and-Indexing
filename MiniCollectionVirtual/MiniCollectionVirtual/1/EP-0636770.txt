<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exhaust
purification device of an internal combustion engine.An internal combustion engine in which an NOx
absorber which absorbs the NOx when an air-fuel ratio of
an inflowing exhaust gas is lean while releases the
absorbed NOx when the air-fuel ratio of the inflowing
exhaust gas is a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio or rich is
arranged in an engine exhaust passage, the NOx generated
when burning a lean air-fuel mixture is absorbed by the
NOx absorber, the air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture
flowing into the NOx absorber is switched from lean to
the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio or rich for a
predetermined constant time before the NOx absorbing
capability of the NOx absorber is saturated to make the
NOx absorber release the NOx, and, at the same time, the
released NOx is reduced has been already proposed by the
present applicant (refer to EP-A-560 991, state of the art according to Art 54(3) EPC).However, the releasing speed and the amount of the
NOx released from the NOx absorber when the air-fuel
ratio of the exhaust gas flowing into the NOx absorber is
switched from lean to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio
or rich so as to release the NOx from the NOx absorber
greatly fluctuate according to the amount of NOx absorbed
in the NOx absorber, the temperature of the NOx absorber,
and the degree of richness at the time when the air-fuel
ratio is switched from lean to rich. Accordingly, when
the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas flowing into the
NOx absorber is designed to be switched from lean to the
stoichiometric air-fuel ratio or rich exactly for a
predetermined constant time when the NOx should be 
released from the NOx absorber as in the above-mentioned
internal combustion engine, if this constant time is too
short, the NOx absorbed in the NOx absorber is not
sufficiently released, and therefore the NOx absorbing
capability of the NOx absorber is gradually decreased and
the absorber finally becomes unable to absorb the NOx,
while if this constant time is too long, even if the
releasing action of the NOx from the NOx absorber is
completed, for example the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust
gas is maintained at rich, and thus a large amount of
unburnt HC and CO will be released into the atmosphere.To prevent a situation where the NOx absorber
becomes unable to absorb the NOx or a large amount of
unburnt HC and CO is released into the atmosphere, it is
sufficient if the air-fuel ratio of the exhaust gas
flowing into the NOx absorber is maintained at the
stoichiometric
