<ABSTRACT>
A self-locking twin-screw mechanism with parallel axes and with a linear contact of the screws having involute herringbone gearing is characterised in that the radii of curvature pnm1 and pnm2 in the cross-section and the radii of curvature pxm1 and pxm2 in the longitudinal section of the profile of the screws are each determined at the contact point M of the screw teeth according to the following equations:  pnm1 = ptm1/cos beta B1; pnm2 = ptm2/cos beta B2, pxm1 = pnm1.sin beta B1 = ptm1.tg beta B1; pxm2 = pnm2.sin beta B2 = ptm2.tg beta B2, in which ptm1 and ptm2 are the radii of curvature of an involute profile in the cross-section at the contact point M and  beta B1 and beta B2 are the tooth inclination angles on the base circles of the screws, with

 in which rm1 and rm2 are the working radii of the circles passing through the contact point M and rB1 and rB2 are the base-circle radii of the screws. A tool for producing the profile of the screws of the self-locking twin-screw mechanism has lathe-turning chisels with rounded cutting edges, having radii of curvature R1 and R2 which are determined by the following formulae:
