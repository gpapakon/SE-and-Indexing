<ABSTRACT>
In this tiltable guide-roller bearing arrangement according to the invention for supporting a rotary drum (3), a guide roller (2) mounted so as to be freely rotatable and an associated supporting structure (8) are provided, the said supporting structure being supported in such a way as to be tiltable relative to a fixed foundation plate (9) with the aid of supporting mounts (10) which are flexible to thrust and are arranged inclined relative to one another in such a way that the centre of rotation of this guide-roller bearing arrangement is situated in the region of the intersection (13) of the contact line between the guide roller (2) and the race (4) of the rotary drum with the vertical centre line of the guide roller. While being of particularly simple and reliable construction, this design permits compensation of tilting of the race of the rotary drum and, at the same time, a significant reduction or substantial avoidance of unwanted consequences of the axial forces resulting from longitudinal movements of the rotary drum.

Tiltable supporting roller bearing for supporting a 
rotary drum (3) which is driven in rotation, comprising 


a) a supporting roller (2) which is supported with its 
roller axle (5) so as to be freely rotatable in two 

pivot bearings (6, 7) and has a circumferential running 
surface (4a) of the rotary drum (3) mounted on its outer 

circumferential surface (2a), 
b) a bearing structure (8) on which the pivot bearings (6, 
7) are arranged and which is tiltably supported by way 

of bearing elements (10) on a stationary foundation 
plate (9), 
 
characterised in that
 
c) the bearing elements are constructed - avoiding a 

linkage with crank-like rockers - as resilient support 
bearings (10) which are easily shifted in their cross 

direction (Q), and in each case in the region below the two 
pivot bearings (6, 7) these support bearings are 

inclined towards one another between the bearing 
structure (8) and the foundation plate (9) in such a way 

that central axes (11, 12) passing vertically through 
them intersect in the region of the point of 

intersection (13) between the vertical central axis (2b) 
of the supporting roller and the line of contact (14) of 

the outer circumferential surface (2a) of the supporting 
roller and the circumferential running surface (4a) of 

the rotary kiln. 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the support bearings (10) are at least 

partially constructed in the form of resilient support bearing  
 

sets. 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the support bearings (10) are 

constructed as elastomeric support bearings. 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that each support bearing (10) is constructed 

in the form of at least one relatively flat strip or in the 
form of support bearing elements assembled in a row, wherein 

each strip or each row of support bearing elements is aligned 
at right angles to the longitudinal roller axis (2c) (cf. 

Figure 2). 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that in the basic position the support 

bearings (10) are inclined towards one another at the same 
angle (Î±) with respect to the horizontal (H). 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterised in that the bearing structure (8) and the 

foundation plate (9) each have in the regions below the two 
pivot bearings (6, 7) two opposing abutment surfaces (8a, 9a 

and 8b, 9b respectively) which run parallel to one another and 
between which an associated support bearing (10) is arranged 

in each case, the imaginary central lines of these abutment 
surfaces running perpendicular thereto coinciding with the 

intersecting central axes (11, 12) of the support bearings 
(10). 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterised in that at least the bearing structure (8) is 

constructed like a profiled frame. 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 1, in 
which two supporting rollers (2) with their bearing structure  

 
(8) are combined to form a supporting roller set, are arranged 

symmetrically on both sides of the vertical longitudinal 
central plane (3a) of the rotary drum (3) to be supported and 

co-operate with the same circumferential running surface (4, 
4a) of this rotary drum, characterised in that the two bearing 

structures (8) are connected to one another by at least one 
spacer element (15, 17, 18) in order to maintain a constant 

spacing. 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 8, 
characterised in that the spacer element (15) advantageously 

has connecting joints (15a, 15b) at its points of connection 
to the bearing structures (8). 
Supporting roller bearing as claimed in Claim 8, 
characterised in that in the region between the two bearing 

structures (8) on the one hand a stationary support element 
(16) is arranged - preferably approximately on the vertical 

longitudinal central plane (3a) of the rotary drum (3) to be 
supported - and on the other hand these two bearing 

structures (8) are connected to one another by two spacer 
elements (17, 18) in such a way that each spacer element is 

flexibly connected at one end to one of the two bearing 
structures (8) and at its other, opposite end to the 

stationary support element (16).
