<DESCRIPTION>
 POWDER COATING COMPOSITION WITH HYDROXYALKYLAMIDE CROSSLINKERThe invention relates to a powder coating compostion comprising as a binder a polymer with free carboxylic acid groups and as a crosslinker a compound containing β-hydroxyalkylamide groups. A powder coating comprising a co-reactable mixture of an amorphous carboxylic acid group containing polyester and a β-hydroxyalkylamide is known from EP-A- 322834. The composition described in this application is cured - after application to a substrate - by heating the powder to 160-200°C so that the powder melts, forming a smooth layer. At that temperature the coating is chemically crosslinked due to an esterification reaction between the acid groups of the polymer and the hydroxy groups of the compound containing β-hydroxyalkylamide groups. According to EP-A-322834, a de-gasifying agent, benzoin (0.5 to 3% by wt. of the powder composition), may be added to the composition. A de-gasifying agent is needed to ensure that the air and/or water entrapped due to melting of the powder (during a curing cycle) are removed from the paint layer as a result of the reaction. Any gas bubbles that remain in the coating reduce the adhesion of the coating to the substrate and markedly adversely affect the protection obtainable with the coating. Although coatings of this composition are characterized in EP-A-322834 as having good physical properties, such compositions are unsuitable for preparing a white or crystal-clear coating because the powder coating exhibits some degree of browning after curing, as indicated in Mercurio, New Perspective on Hydroxyamide Crosslinkers, 16th International Conf. in Org. Sci. and Tech. 235-49 (Athens, Greece 1990).Also, browning appears to intensify upon heating 

the cured powder coating at a temperature of 200°C for a prolonged period of time (for example between 30 and 60 minutes). This discolouration upon excessive curing (yellowing on overbake) increases with the amount of benzoin. A lower amount of benzoin, on the other hand, results in a lower blister limit, such as lower than 60 μm, which results in surface defects.The object of the invention is to provide a powder coating composition in which it is possible to use a small amount of benzoin, for example between 0.05 and 0.8 wt.%, to obtain the highest possible blister limit, for example higher than 120 μm. Of course, the powder coatings must also retain good mechanical properties, such as, for example, good gloss, toughness and impact resistance and chemical properties such as for
