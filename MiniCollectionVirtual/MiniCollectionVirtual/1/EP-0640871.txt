<ABSTRACT>
This invention describes the use of 
surfactants (30) of the following types: 


Type A - Surfactant comprising a 6 to 22 
carbon atom hydrophobic tail with one or more attached 

hydrophilic chains comprising at least 8 oxyethylene 
and/or glycidyl ether groups that may or may not be 

terminated with a negative charge such as a sulfate 
group. 
Type B - Block oligomeric surfactants 
comprising hydrophobic polyoxypropylene blocks (A) and 

hydrophilic polyoxyethylene blocks (B) joined in the 
manner of A-B-A, B-A-B, A-B, (A-B)
n
-G-(B-A)
n
, or 
(B-A)
n
-G-(A-B)
n
, 
where G is a connective organic moiety and 

n is from 1 to 3. 
Type C - Sugar surfactants, comprising from 
one to three 6 to 22 carbon atom hydrophobic tails with 

one or more attached hydrophilic mono or 
oligosaccharidic chains that may or may not be 

terminated by a negatively charged group such as a 
sulfate group. 
 
In combination with gelatin-grafted-polymer particles (20) 

to obtain aggregation and defect free photographic 
multilayer coatings that are considerably low in 

pressure sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to coating
compositions of soft polymer particles in combination
with certain types of long hydrophilic chain surface
active agents to prepare coated layers of photographic
elements less sensitive to mechanical pressure.U.S. Patents 4,855,219 issued to
Bagchi et al. and 4,920,004 issued to Bagchi described
strongly adhering matte bead particles for photographic
systems having a polymeric core covalently bonded to a
gelatin shell. These particles are referred to as
gelatin grafted polymer particles (gel-g polymer
particles).Soft polymer latex particles covalently
bonded to gelatin particles, the preparation thereof
and their use as materials that can be incorporated in
photographic layers to reduce the pressure sensitivity
of various photographic products are extensively
described in U.S. 5,026,632 and U.S. 5,066,572. The
particles are described as gelatin-grafted soft latex
particles (gel-g soft latex particles) which when
subjected to a subsequent crosslinking produces a soft
core surrounded by a shell of cross-linked gelatin and
referred to as case hardened gel-grafted soft latex
particles (CH gel-g latex particles). Thus, the term
"gel-g particles refers to both described types of
particles covalently bonded to a shell of gelatin.Even though in many cases photographic layers
comprising gel-g-latexes or case-hardened gel-g-latexes
can be coated without any difficulty or product defects
many times, defects due to aggregation or flocculation
involving the gel-g-latexes or case-hardened gel-g-latex 
particle have been seen in fabricated
photographic coatings. This is a serious disadvantage
for the formulation of photographic products with
layers comprising gel-g-latex or case-hardened gel-g-latexes.There is an urgent need to reduce coating
defects arising out of flocculation of the gel-g-latexes
or case-hardened gel-g-latexes that are coated
in photographic layers to reduce the sensitivity of
photographic products to mechanical stress or pressure.An objective of this invention is to produce
a photographic product with less pressure sensitivity
comprising gelatin-grafted soft polymer particles that
are free of defects arising out of the aggregation or
flocculation of its composite particles.Another objective of this invention is to
produce a photographic coating composition employing
gelatin-grafted-soft polymer particles that are free of
aggregates or flocculants of the said composite
particles.These and other objectives of this invention
are achieved by adding a surfactant
