<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automatic firing unit (1) for driving a blower (3) having a blower drive (2) and a fuel pump (5) having a fuel pump drive (4). The automatic firing unit (1) has a programmer (20) which controls and monitors a start-up process and continuous operation, blower (3) and fuel pump (5) being controlled at each operating point in accordance with the data stored in a desired value memory (22). According to the invention, the automatic firing unit (1) has an operating mode switch (28), in whose "SET" position a desired value generator (27) determines desired values for the units for controlling air quantity and fuel quantity, taking into account measured data from an exhaust gas probe (26) connected to an interface (25), and writes the said desired values into the desired value memory (22). By means of the invention, it is made possible to configure the automatic firing unit (1) at the first start-up and/or a later adjustment in such a way that optimal desired values are determined for the units for controlling air quantity and fuel quantity, in order to achieve favourable emission values from a burner controlled by the automatic firing unit (1), without having to connect a computer for this purpose.

<CLAIMS>
An automatic firing arrangement (1) for actuating a fan (3) with 
a fan drive (2) and a fuel pump (5) with a fuel pump drive (4), wherein 

the automatic firing arrangement (1) has a control input (13) serving for 
switching it on and off and for output presetting control, a reference 

data storage means (22) for reference values associated with individual 
output levels for the operation of units for the control of amounts of 

air and amounts of fuel, and a programmer (20) which controls and 
monitors a start-up procedure and continuous operation of a burner 

operated with liquid fuel in a low-output to medium-output heating 
installation, characterised in that 


the automatic firing arrangement (1) has a reference value 
generator (27) which can be activated by a mode switch (28), 
the mode switch (28) has two possible positions, namely 
a position 'RUN' in which operation of the combustion device 
managed by the automatic firing arrangement (1) is controlled by the 

programmer (20) in accordance with the data in the reference data storage 
means (22), and 
a second position 'SET' in which the reference value generator 
(27) ascertains reference values for the units for control of the amounts 

of air and the amounts of fuel, in consideration of measurement data from 
a flue gas probe (26) connected to an interface (25), and writes said 

reference values into the reference data storage means (22). 
An automatic firing arrangement (1) according to claim 1 
characterised in that the mode switch (28) can be automatically 

controlled into the position 'SET' by a signal from the flue gas probe 
(26) which occurs at the interface (25). 
An automatic firing arrangement (1) according to claim 1 or 
claim 2 characterised in that the mode switch (28) is controllable into 

the position 'SET' by the programmer (20).  
 
An automatic firing arrangement (1) according to one of claims 1 
to 3 characterised in that the reference value generator (27) 

automatically successively goes to different predetermined working 
points. 
An automatic firing arrangement (1) according to claim 4 
characterised in that the number of predetermined working points is 

restricted to three, wherein a first working point applies for a minimum 
output N
min
, a second working point applies for a medium output N
mittel
 
and a third working point applies for a highest output N , and that the 

reference value generator (27) automatically goes to further working 
points between those predetermined working points if the three working 

points do not approximately form a straight line.
