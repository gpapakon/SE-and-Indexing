<ABSTRACT>
In a speech communication system 
equipped with an echo canceller 

(30) for offsetting echoes reaching a microphone 
(14) from a speaker (13) for 

hand-free speech, the echo canceller (3) 
includes a volume controller (36) for 

changing the sound volume of a speech 
reception signal, an amplitude limiter 

(35) for limiting the amplitude of an output 
signal of the volume controller (36), 

echo cancellers (31, 32) for estimating 
a pseudo-echo signal from the output 

of the amplitude limiter and subtracting 
the estimated pseudo-echo signal from a 

transmission speech signal, and a nonlinear 
filter (34) for processing the output 

of the echo cancellers. In this manner the 
amplitude level of the reception speech 

signal is limited to not higher than a 
predetermined level. Accordingly, even 

when a reception speech signal having a 
high reception speech signal level is inputted 

to the echo cancellers, the echo 
cancellers can always cancel sufficiently 

the sound echo and so send speech without 
distortion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a speech 
communication apparatus having an echo canceler for 
canceling acoustic echoes generated during hands-free 
speech as in a mobile telephone apparatus. Of all radio telephone sets mounted in vehicles, 
such as a mobile telephone apparatus, an apparatus has a 
hands-free speech mode in addition to a handset talking 
mode. The hands-free speech mode is a mode in which a 
receiving speech loudspeaker and a transmitting speech 
microphone are arranged in a telephone apparatus body or 
a dashboard independently of a handset, and the 
loudspeaker and the microphone constitute a handset to 
perform talking. In this hands-free speech mode, a 
speaker can speak without holding a handset. The 
speaker can safely speak without having to hold the 
steering wheel with a single hand even during driving. 
The hands-free speech mode is very useful to improve 
safety during driving. In such a hands-free speech mode, however, a 
received speech output from the loudspeaker is input to 
the microphone during talking to produce an acoustic 
echo. This echo signal is often transmitted to the  
 
partner side. Therefore, an echo canceler for canceling 
the above echo signal is generally arranged in a 
telephone apparatus having such a hands-free speech 
mode. In a radio telephone apparatus for encoding a 
speech signal into digital data and transmitting the 
digital data, the echo canceler is inevitably used 
because signal delays caused by a speech 
encoding/decoding circuit (speech codec) and an error 
correction encoding/decoding circuit (channel codec) are 
large so that the acoustic echoes bother the speaker. A conventional acoustic echo canceler comprises a 
digital signal processor. This processor comprises 
arithmetic operation means for simulating acoustic 
characteristics of an echo path from the loudspeaker to 
the microphone, subtracting means for obtaining a difference 
between an output from the arithmetic operation 
means and an input from the microphone, and means for 
changing the acoustic characteristics of the arithmetic 
operation means such that the output from the subtracter 
becomes zero. In this processor, a speech signal 
supplied to the loudspeaker is supplied to the arithmetic 
operation means to generate a pseudo acoustic 
echo, and this pseudo acoustic echo is subtracted from 
an actual transmitting speech signal (containing the 
acoustic echo) transmitted from the microphone, thereby 
canceling the acoustic echo. An output from the 
subtracter is deviated
