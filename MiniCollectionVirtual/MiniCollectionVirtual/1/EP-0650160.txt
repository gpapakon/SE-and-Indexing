<ABSTRACT>
Provision is made of a traverse cycle measuring circuit (12) for measuring 
the traverse cycle based on a signal CNIN obtained by digitalizing the tracking 

error signal (TE) at the time of a track traverse, a register (RC, 14) in which any 
target value of the traverse cycle can be set, a circuit (16) for comparing the 

measured traverse cycle and set target value, control circuits (18-26), for 
controlling the tracking and sled so that the detected speed of traverse converges to 

a target value, and counting circuits (28, 30) for counting the number of traversed 
tracks based on the signal CNIN, the target value of the register (RC, 14) being 

reset to a value by which the speed of traverse is reduced when the count of the 
counting circuit (30) reaches a number of tracks (N-α) smaller than the target 

number of tracks by exactly α.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tracking traverse control circuit for
controlling the track jump operation in a CD player etc.In a CD player, there are often cases of jumping from one track to another
track, for example, at the time of going to the start of a music.In particular, in a CD ROM, it is particularly important in terms of
performance that data can be instantaneously retrieved. Therefore, the
performance of the optical servo signal processing circuit for processing optical
servo signals has important significance.US patent 4 914 725 and EP 0 408 392 show a tracking traverse control
circuit for making a head unit, disposed so as to face a recording medium on
which a plurality of tracks are formed, move from a current track to a target track
with the help of a movement speed detection means for detecting the speed of
movement of said head unit, a movement speed control means for comparing the
detected speed of movement and a pre-set target value of a speed of movement
and controlling the speed of movement converges with said target value. Said
head unit has a tracking servo system (TRK) and a sled servo system (SLD) for
making the entire head unit move.Optical system servo signal processing circuits for CD players have
already been realized by LSIs. At the present time, both analog processing and
digital processing types are in general use.In current general servo systems, circuits for controlling the servo signal
processing (servo auto sequencers) are being developed. These sequencers are
being controlled by microcomputers.Figure 1 is a block diagram of a servo signal control system of a CD
player.In Fig. 1, 1 represents a CPU used as a microcomputer, 2 represents a
servo auto sequencer, 3 represents a servo signal processing IC, and 4 represents
an optical system.In such a configuration, when a servo auto sequencer receives an auto
sequence command S1 from the CP1, a servo control sequence is started, and a
command code and 8-bit serial data are generated for controlling the servo signal
processing IC 3 to supply them to the servo signal processing IC 3 as a signal S2. The signal S2 supplied from the servo auto sequencer 2 to the servo
signal processing IC 3, more specifically, as shown in Fig. 2, is comprised of the
clock signal CLK, data DAT, and latch signal XLT.The data DAT, as shown in Fig. 4A, is comprised of D0 to D7 8-bit serial
code data. The upper four bits "0010" of the 8-bit serial code mean that the
command relates to tracking servo and sled servo control. Among the lower four
