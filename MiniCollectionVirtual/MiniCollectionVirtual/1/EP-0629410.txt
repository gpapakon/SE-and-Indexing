<ABSTRACT>
The steriliser comprises a sterilisation chamber (2) for reception of objects to be sterilised and used in medical treatments. The sterilisation chamber (2) can be locked with a door (1). An attached control unit (6) comprises a control panel (9) with operating elements (10) and a card reader (11) on the front. Above the control panel there is a display field (12), in particular, for display of equipment data and for displaying an operation guide by means of an LCD display. Chip cards which have an electronic component with a non-volatile storage medium and which can be connected electrically with the card reader, so that data exchange with the control unit is possible, can be used to run special sterilisation programmes, to monitor the authorisation for operating the steriliser in a simple way and to simply perform further functions such as locking or release of individual operating elements, without any impairment of the easy operation of the device.
