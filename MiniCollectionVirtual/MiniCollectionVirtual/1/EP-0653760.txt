<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory
device, and more particularly to a voltage boosting circuit
for boosting a supply voltage supplied from a system to a
desired boosting voltage level. The term "voltage boosting
circuit" has the same meaning in this field as "boosting
circuit", "boosting voltage generating circuit", "bootstrap
circuit", etc.In a dynamic RAM consisting of CMOS transistors, there
occurs a voltage drop by the threshold voltage of the MOS
transistor in the effective potential while the potential
is transmitted through the channel region of the MOS
transistor. This inevitable voltage drop becomes an
obstacle to the accurate reading or writing of data as well
as the loss of data. To solve such a problem, a voltage
boosting circuit for raising the voltage level has come to
be used. A voltage boosting circuit comprising bipole, diodes is known from U. TIETZE-CH. SCHENK, Halbleiterschaltungstechnik, Springer Verlag Berlin, 1974, pages 35-36. DE-A-4 237 589 discloses a voltage boosting circuit according to the preamble of claim 1, having precharge and transmission MOS transistors. As further examples of such a voltage boosting circuit,
there are Korean patent No. 91-19740; a paper entitled "A
35ns 64Mb DRAM Using On-Chip Boosted Power Supply", 1992
Symposium on VLSI Circuits Digest of Technical Papers,
pp.64-65 and U.S. patent No. 4,704,706 granted to Japan
Fujitsu Co.Fig. 1 schematically shows a characteristic portion of a
voltage boosting circuit which is generally well known in
the art and described in the aforementioned documents. An
input node 2 receives an oscillating signal OSC generated
from an oscillator (not shown). A pumping capacitor 4 has
one electrode terminal coupled to the input node 2 and the
other electrode terminal coupled to a pumping node 8. A
pumping capacitor 6 has one electrode terminal coupled to
the input node 2 and the other electrode terminal coupled
to a pumping node 10. A transmission transistor 12 with the
gate and drain connected to the pumping node 8 and 10
respectively generates a boosting voltage VPP. Although not shown in Fig. 1, there is further provided a
precharge circuit for precharging the pumping nodes 8 and
10 to a supply voltage VCC level. The construction of Fig.
1 is known in the art as a charge pump circuit. The
oscillator operates when the boosting voltage VPP is
lowered to a level lower than a normal level by an internal
circuit during power-up of a chip and active cycle. If the
oscillating signal OSC is supplied to the input
