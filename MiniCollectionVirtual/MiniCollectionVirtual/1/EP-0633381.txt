<ABSTRACT>
The composite panel (1) for producing rooms, cabinets, safes and similar secure facilities which are protected against fire, water, gas- and break-in exhibits a layered structure composed of an intermediate layer or armoured layer (2) made up of a multiplicity of pre-stressed flat bodies or large-surface-area arrangements (3) of elastic material with integrated, pre-stressed reinforcement elements (4), of a sheet-steel module (5) which receives the flat bodies (3) of the intermediate layer (2) and is arranged on the outer side of the same, of a layer (6) which adjoins the sheet-steel module (5) and consists of a heat-insulating material such as concrete, of two layers (7) which border the inner side of the intermediate layer (2) and consist of a heat-insulating material such as polyurethane, and of a layer (8) which consists of a heat-absorbing material such as sodium sulphate or phosphate, and of an outer casing (9) and an inner casing (10) which are designed as steel modules. The composite panel (1) offers optimum protection against the action of heat from the outside and against break-in.

<CLAIMS>
A composite board for constructing security devices, rooms, cabinets, safes for 
example, which protect against external damaging factors such as fire, damp, entry of 

water, burning gases, magnetic fields and against breaking in, with a layer structure of 
heat insulating and heat absorbing materials which resist breaking in, comprising a 

layer structure having an intermediate layer (2) known per se and resisting breaking in, 
which contains one or more prestressed flat bodies (3) of elastic material with 

embedded, prestressed reinforcing elements (4), at least one layer (6) of heat insulating 
material, such as concrete, adjoining the outside of the intermediate layer (2), at least 

one layer (7) of heat insulating material such as polyurethane adjoining the inside of 
the intermediate layer (2) and a layer (8) of heat absorbing materials such as sodium 

sulphate or phosphate, as well as an outer cladding (9) and an inner cladding (10), 
which are in the form of sheet metal cases.
