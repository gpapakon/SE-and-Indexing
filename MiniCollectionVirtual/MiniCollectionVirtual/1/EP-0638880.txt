<ABSTRACT>
A fake-proof card verification system allows for the 
reading of data from an EEPROM memory device. A photographic-type 

image is stored in the memory device. The data comprises 
a data table containing randomly distributed unique serialized 

information. This information may be the serial number of the 
encoding read/write terminal, or the issue number of the 

particular identification information created by the encoding 
terminal. Desired verification data is downloaded from a central 

processing system. Advantageously, the system uses color cell 
compression for the acquisition, digitization and compression of 

the photographic-type image, which may be a facial 
representation, fingerprint, signature, voice print, eye retina 

or any other unique personal identification in a compressed form 
which may rea
d by the decoding system to verify the positive 
identification of the presenter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a method of verifying fake-proof video identification data.Various forms of customer cards are in common use. In
many instances it is readily possible to create a fake or
fraudulent card which can be used to the detriment of the card
issuer or an establishment accepting a card. For example, one
common form of an identification card is a state issued drivers
license. This card usually includes a photograph of the card
holder. The photograph on a drivers license can be altered.
Alternatively a fraudulent card can be made. Credit or debit
cards are often used for purchases. Such cards include embossment
of the card holder's name and card number. Often, these
cards also include a magnetic stripe to provide a higher level
of security. However, these cards can also be easy to counterfeit.
To verify transactions using such cards, it is often
necessary to compare the card number to a list of fraudulent or
stolen cards or by telephoning a credit card verification
service.In order to minimize fraud, certain card identification
systems have been used in which a memory in some form on the card
stores data representing a user's credentials, such as a
photograph or fingerprint. Such systems are disclosed, for 
example, in US-A-4993068 and US-A-5027401. Both patents
disclose a system in which a photographic representation is
stored in the memory means for later retrieval at a remote
site. However it is not apparent that such systems would
provide adequate protection from counterfeiting.US-A-5214659 relates to a decoding system for reading
data from a user identification card memory device. Video
information is decoded from the memory device and video
information data is displayed on a display device to verify
authenticity of the user.According to the present invention there is provided
a method as set out in claim 1.Optional features of the invention include the step
of converting the video information data table for display
on a display device at the remote location to verify
authenticity of the user, and the step at the converting
step of decoding compressed digitized video information
stored in the information data table. The video data table
may comprise a table of N bytes of data and the separating
step may include the steps of creating an offset table
using the first M bytes of data, where M is less than N,
the offset table defining an offset value for each of a
plurality of index numbers, selecting index values using
video table data and sequentially removing bytes of data
from the

<CLAIMS>
A method of validating at a central location a
transaction occurring at a remote location, the transaction

comprising presenting a user identification device including
memory means for storing video information data made fake proof

by random distribution of non-related verification information
data elements, the method comprising the steps of:


transferring from a processing system at the central
location to a processing system at the remote location unique

digitized system verification information, said digitized
verification information comprising a desired verification data

table;
operating the remote location processing system in
response to a user identification device being presented by
reading a video data table from a memory means of the
presented user identification device, the video data table

including a video information data table having elements of
verification data at selected distributed locations,
separating said verification data from said video data
table to provide the information data table,
creating an actual verification data table using said
separated verification data,
comparing said actual verification data table to said
desired verification data table to verify authenticity of the

user identification device, and 
communicating with the central location processing
system to verify and report authenticity of the presented user

identification device; and
recording at the central location processing system a
log of remote transactions.
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step
of converting the video information data table for display on a

display device at the remote location to verify authenticity of
the user.
The method of claim 2 wherein said converting step
further comprises the step of decoding compressed digitized video

information stored in the information data table.
The method of claim 1 wherein said video data
table comprises a table of N bytes of data and said separating

step includes the steps of creating an offset table using the
first M bytes of data, where M 
<
 N, said offset table defining
an offset value for each of a plurality of index numbers,

selecting index values using video table data, and sequentially
removing bytes of data from the video data table at positions

related to the offset values associated with the selected index
