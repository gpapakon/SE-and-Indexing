<ABSTRACT>
A disk drive has an electrical interconnect (62, 70; 80, 80a) for 
coupling one or more conductors (56) provided on an actuator arm to a flexible 

connector (80, 80a). The interconnect consists of one or more tabs (62, 70) 
extending beyond a peripheral edge (52) of the actuator arm (26) and one or 

more slots (88-91) formed on the flexible connector (80) to receive the tabs 
(62, 70). After the tabs (62, 70) are inserted into the corresponding slots (88-91), 

the tabs (62, 70) and flexible connector (82) define L-shaped joints. Solder 
beads (93) are deposited in these L-shaped joints to electrical couple the 

actuator arm (26) to the flexible connector (80, 80a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to computer disk drives.Conventional computer disk drives have one or more actuator arms
which are moveable relative to one or more corresponding rotatable magnetic
disks. The movable actuator arm extends across the disk to position a magnetic
head radially over concentric tracks in the disk.This invention relates to the problems associated with electrically
interfacing the magnetic head with electronic circuitry located external to the
actuator arm. The most common interfacing technique is to hand solder each
conductive lead on the actuator arm to a flexible circuit. The flexible circuit is
designed to bend and yield as the actuator arm is moved across the magnetic
disk. The hand soldering technique is labor intensive and results in increased
manufacturing costs.An automated technique involving thermal compression bonding
has also been introduced, but has not been widely accepted within the industry
at this time.IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, vol. 32, no. 3A, pages 348-349, published
on August 1989, N.Y. U.S., and titled "Disk File Head Lead Connection"
discloses a disk drive having an actuator arm with the electrical conductor provided
on said arm and electrically connected to the read/write head on one end and to
tabs having conductive pads on the other end. The conductors are bonded by using
ultrasonic bonding.This invention introduces a new technique for electrically
interconnecting the actuator arm to the flexible circuit. The resulting
interconnect is durable and conducive to automation.The invention provides a disk drive as defined in claim 1.According to one aspect of this invention, a disk drive has at least
one storage disk and at least one actuator arm movable relative to the storage
disk. The actuator arm supports and radially positions a read/write head across
the disk. One or more conductors are provided on the actuator arm, with each
conductor having a first end electrically coupled to the read/write head and a
second end. The actuator arm has a shape defined by a peripheral edge running 
about its perimeter. A tab portion extends beyond the peripheral edge of the
actuator arm. One or more conductive pads are provided on the tab and are
electrically coupled to the second ends of the conductors on the actuator arm.
A flexible connector is positioned adjacent to the actuator arm. The connector
has one or more conductive traces formed on a flexible non-conductive layer. A
slot is formed in the connector adjacent to the conductive traces and sized to
receive the
