<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for regulating the common-mode output voltage of a balanced amplifier with two differential outputs (S, Ss), comprising a differential stage (D) supplying a correction signal for the said common-mode voltage corresponding to the offset between the mean (VCM) of the voltages on the differential outputs and a reference voltage (VCM0, and a current generator fixing the bias current of the differential stage. According to the invention, the current generator is a generator (M3) controlled only by the output current of the balanced amplifier.

A device for the regulation of the common mode
voltage at the output of a balanced amplifier having two

differential outputs (P, Ps), comprising a differential
stage (D) providing a correction signal of said common mode

voltage corresponding to the difference between an average
value (VCM) of the voltages at the differential outputs and

a reference voltage (VCM
0
), and a current generator setting
the polarization current of the differential stage, wherein

the current generator is a generator (M3) controlled by the
output current of the balanced amplifier.
The regulation device of claim 1, wherein the
balanced amplifier includes two output stages, each

comprising two current mirrors (M1, M2) having an opposite
polarity and whose outputs are interconnected, and wherein

said differential stage (D) provides an additional correction
current, having an appropriate polarity, to the input

current of a first (M2) of said two current mirrors.
The regulation device of claim 2, wherein the
current generator setting the polarization current of said

differential stage (D) includes a current mirror (M3) that
duplicates, possibly with a multiplying factor (k), the output

current of said first current mirror (M2).
The regulation device of claim 2, wherein the
differential stage (D) includes an output branch that is

connected to the input of a current mirror (M4) having its
output parallel-connected to the input of the first current

mirror (M2).
The regulation device of claim 3, wherein the
current mirror (M3) providing the polarization current to

the differential stage (D) is controlled by a second output 
(T7) of the first current mirror (M2), the first output (T4)

of said first current mirror being the output that is
connected to the output of the second (M1) current mirror of

the output stage.
