<ABSTRACT>
A one-way air valve for relieving pressure within the passenger compartment of an automobile includes a plastic frame (10) having an air passage (24) therethrough with a flap (38) integrally molded with the frame but of more elastic material and connected to the frame by a living hinge (44). The flap is molded in a position extending through the passageway and the living hinge is spring loaded by swinging the flap back through the passageway to overlie the outside of the frame over the passageway, thereby biasing the flap against the frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SPECIFICATION ONE-WAY AIR VALVEField of InventionThis invention relates to one-way check valves and particularly to such a valve for use in conjunction with air vent control for the passenger compartment of automotive-type vehicles.Background of the InventionWith the advent of nearly air-tight passenger compartments for automobile bodies, the need has arisen to provide venting which will permit the escape of air pressure occasioned by the slamming or rapid closure of the vehicle door while preventing the entry of outside air. Patents 4,691,623 and 4,972,765 disclose devices for permitting the escape of air from the passenger compartment to the outside of the body. The devices disclosed in these patents require two or more parts to be assembled together, such as a frame structure and a valve structure, and this necessarily raises the cost of the device. Other patents showing one-way check valves are: 2,249,5571,881,929 3,568,977 4,324,097Of these, patents 2,249,557 and 1,881,929 show a flap which is formed integrally with the valve seat. In both cases the flap and valve seat are formed of the same material and only 

gravity serves to bias the flap against the valve seat, and as a consequence the flap may readily flutter open.Summary of The InventionThe invention herein disclosed comprises a one-way air valve for mounting, for example, in the fire wall of the vehicle body and includes a molded plastic frame with an integrally molded plastic flap adapted to overlie the outside of the frame and cover an air passageway therein. The flap is swingable away from the frame to open the passage to allow escape of air from the passenger compartment and is tensioned against the frame over the passageway to keep it closed and prevent ingress of unwanted outside air. The flap has a plastic connecting portion or living hinge molded in situ integrally with the frame and flap and formed of a more elastic plastic than that of the frame. The flap is originally molded in a position projecting through the air passageway and is swung from this position through the passageway to overlie the outside thereof with such swinging movement elastically loading the connecting hinge portion to bias the flap against the outside of the frame over the air passageway. As a result of this construction, separate parts do not need to be assembled together as the entire structure is molded as a single unit. Following the molding operation it is only necessary to swing the air flap through the passageway to overlie the outside of the frame

CLAIMS: 1. A one-way air valve for relieving pressure within an automobile compartment when a door is closed rapidly comprising, in combination: a molded plastic frame for mounting at an aperture of a compartment wall and having an inside face and an outside face with at least one air passageway extending therethrough between the faces; a plastic flap overlying the outside face of the frame and covering the air passageway to block air flow into the automobile and swingable away from the frame to open the passageway upon air pressure build-up in the compartment; said flap having a plastic connecting portion molded in situ integrally with the frame and being formed of a more elastic plastic than the plastic of the frame and resistingly bendable to permit the flap to be swung from an initial molded position projecting through the air passageway and beyond the inside face of the frame to an operative position overlying the outside face of the frame and covering the air passageway, said flap portion being elastically loaded by the aforesaid swinging of the flap from said initial position to said operative position to urge the flap yieldingly against the outside of the frame covering the air passageway; and said flap portion, when the flap is in said operative position, blocking air flow through the air passageway in a direction to enter an automobile compartment and yielding to an increase in air pressure in such compartment to open and allow air flow through the passageway out of the compartment. 


 2. The invention of claim 2 wherein the frame is formed of plastic selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and the like. 3. The invention of claim 2 wherein the flap and hinge is formed of plastic selected from the group consisting of thermoplastic rubber, such as Santoprene, and Kraton. 4. The invention of claim 1 wherein the frame is formed of a plastic selected from the group consisting of polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and the like, and the flap and hinge is formed from a plastic selected from the group consisting of thermoplastic rubber, such as Santoprene, and Kraton. 5. The invention defined by claim 1 wherein said flap is sufficiently elastic to be distorted to pass through said passageway from its original molded position to its operative position and spring back to its undistorted shape to overlie the outside of the frame and cover the passageway. 6. A one-way fluid flow control valve comprising, in combination: a molded frame having an inside face and an outside face with at least one fluid passageway extending therethrough between the faces; a plastic flap overlying the outside face of the frame and covering the passageway to block fluid flow in one direction and swingable away from the frame to open the passageway upon fluid flow in the opposite direction; " said flap having a plastic connecting portion molded in situ integrally with the frame and being formed of a more 



elastic plastic than the plastic of the frame and resistingly bendable to permit the flap to be swung from an initial molded position projecting through the passageway and beyond the inside face of a frame to an operative position overlying the outside face of the frame and covering the passageway, said flap portion being elastically loaded by the aforesaid swinging of the flap from said initial position to said operative position to urge the flap yieldingly against the outside of the frame covering air passageway; and said flap portion, when the flap is in said operative position, blocking fluid flow through the passageway in one direction and yielding to fluid flow in the opposite direction to open and allow flow through the passageway.
