<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for determining the 
concentration of urea in a milk sample. Urea is present in milk in very small concentrations in the 
range of, normally, 0.01-0.06%. The concentration of urea in 
milk, in particular raw milk, combined with the concentration 
of protein, is an important factor in the regulation of the 
feeding of the livestock. Therefore, it is of great 
importance to be able to determine the concentration of urea 
in milk on a regular basis. However, the methods available 
for this purpose until now, predominantly based on 
determination of ammonia formed in enzymatic breakdown of 
urea with urease, are time-consuming and require relatively 
expensive reagents, for which reason the determination is 
normally performed at relatively long intervals, such as 1-3 
months, which, however, is unsatisfactory from the point of 
view of having an effective farm management. Infrared light measurements offer the means of rapid and 
inexpensive measurement of the components of milk. However, 
due to the relatively small amounts of urea compared to the 
variations of the major components of milk, and the fact that 
the spectral features of these components coincide with the 
spectral features of urea, in other words, there is no 
specific absorption wavebands characteristic to only urea, 
the known methods for determining components of milk by 
infrared light measurement are not able to provide useful 
information about urea concentration. The known methods for infrared determination of milk components 
are performed as follows: Apart from measuring the attenuation of light in a waveband 
showing a characteristic absorption of a component to be 
determined, such as, e.g., fat, the absorption in a waveband  
 
in the near vicinity and substantially representing the 
background (the influence from other components) is measured 
and subtracted from the result of the first measurement, 
thereby obtaining correction for spectral phenomena caused by 
interfering components. However, due to the exceedingly low 
concentration of urea compared to the major components of 
milk (thus, e.g. fat, which absorbs in the same wavebands as 
urea, is normally present in amounts which are about 100-500 
times larger than the amounts of urea, and can vary by 
amounts themselves are, e.g. 50-200 times the absolute amount 
of urea present, and similar effects apply in a lesser degree 
to the other major components of milk), and also due to the 
high degree of spectral interferences from those
