<ABSTRACT>
Break warning device for a sliding connector (1), which is permanently anchored to a carrier (2), of a current collector device. The sliding connector (1) has in the direction of its longitudinal extent in the half facing the carrier (2) of the sliding connector a groove (3) or hole (4) into which a signal rod (5) which breaks brittlely is fitted. On one of its sides, the signal rod (5) is secured in an unmovable holder (23) and a holding device (14) with a movable holding element (7; 8) engages on the other side, the said holding device subjecting the rod (5) to tensile stress. When the sliding connector (1) breaks, the signal rod (5) also breaks. As a result of the tensile force acting on it, the residual part of the signal rod (5) which is connected to the movable holding element (7; 8) moves in the direction of the resultant of the forces and, in this process or after it makes contact with a switching element (15), triggers a damage-limiting process.

Break indicator for a collector shoe (1), on a 
current-collector device of electrically operated 

vehicles, the collector shoe (1) transmitting 
electrical current and consisting substantially of 

carbon or completely of carbon, being firmly anchored 
to the collector-shoe support (2) of the current-collector 

device, with the collector shoe (1) at the 
side facing the collector-shoe support (2) having over 

at least a substantial part of its longitudinal extent 
a recess (3) extending in a straight line,
 
characterized in that
 
   a bar (5) adapted to the form of this recess (3) 

with regard to cross section and length is inserted in 
the recess in such a way that it can still be displaced 

along the longitudinal extent of the recess (3), 
in that this bar (5) consists of a brittle material 

and, when the collector shoe (1) breaks, this bar also 
breaks as a result of its arrangement in the recess (3) 

and its susceptibility to brittle fracture,
 
   and in that this bar (5) is fixed at a first end 

in an immoveable fastening (23) and is secured at the 
end opposite the first end by a displaceable element 

(7) of a holding device (14), which element loads the 
bar (5) with a tensile force, with this holding device 

(14) being constructed in such a way that, upon 
breaking of the collector shoe (1), and thus of the bar 

(5) located therein, the displaceable holding element 
(7) of the holding device (14) and the broken part of 

the bar (5) connected thereto are no longer secured to 
move in the direction of the action of the tensile 

force and according to set a switching and control 
mechanism into operation which leads to the release of 

a warning signal or to the current collector being put 
out of operation.  

 
Break indicator according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the recess (3) extending in a 

straight line is located in the half of the collector 
shoe (1) which faces the collector-shoe support (2). 
Break indicator according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the bar (5) in the recess (3) 

consists of carbon or graphite. 
Break indicator according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the bar (5) in the recess (3) 

consists of ceramics. 
Break indicator according to claim 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the bar (5) in the recess (3) 

consists of a synthetic resin which is brittle at 
temperatures up to + 120°C and has a content of more 

than 30% by weight powdery or granular fillers of non-elastic 
material. 
Break indicator according to one of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the tensile force acting on 

the bar (5) is applied by means of a pressure spring 
(13) which acts against a body of the holding device 

(14) which is constructed as a switching element (7) 
displaceable when the bar (1) breaks, the body being 

coupled to the end of the bar. 
Break indicator according to one of claims 1 
to 5, characterized in that the tensile force acting on 

the bar (5) is applied by means of a piston (7) which 
is loaded with a pressure fluid, is displaceable in a 

cylinder (6) firmly connected to the holding device 
(14), and acts as a moving switching element, the 

piston being coupled to the end of the bar. 
Break indicator according to one of claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that in relation to the cross 

section of the collector shoe (1) the upper limiting of 
the recess (3) located in the collector shoe (1) lies 

between one third and one sixth of the height of the 
collector shoe (1).  

 
Break indicator according to one of claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that the displaceable bar (5) 

largely fills the cross section of the recess (3) and 
does not extend beyond it at the side facing the 

collector-shoe support (2). 
Break indicator according to one of claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that the gap (10) between a side 

wall of the recess (3) and the wall of the bar (5) 
directly adjacent to this side wall does not amount to 

more than 0.5 mm. 
Break indicator according to one of claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that the gap (10) between a side 

wall of the recess (3) and the wall of the bar (5) 
directly adjacent to this side wall does not amount to 

more than 0.1 mm.
