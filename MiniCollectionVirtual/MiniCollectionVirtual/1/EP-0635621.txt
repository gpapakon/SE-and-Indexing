<ABSTRACT>
A lock mandrel for use in a locking system to 
releasably position well flow control devices in a flow 

conduit of a well. 
A lock mandrel (15) and a landing nipple (10) are 
mounted in a conduit. The lock mandrel has a longitudinal 

flow passage (15a) therethrough, and includes 

(a) an upper mandrel (17) with openings (18); 
(b) helically profiled segment means (19) to locate 
the locking mandrel in the landing nipple, which 

segment means are radially moveable in the 
openings; 
(c) a support (22) mounted in a first position in said 
mandrel, in which position the profiled segment 

means (19) are expanded, and is slidably moveable 
to a second position, in which the profiled 

segment means are in a retracted position; 
(d) a lower body (26) with a metal sealing surface 
(26a); 
(e) means (24) swivelably connected to the upper 
mandrel; and 
(f) force transmitting means (W) for transmitting 
force between the upper mandrel and said lower 

body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lock mandrel, and, in 
particular, to a lock mandrel for use in a locking system 
useful to releasably position well flow control devices in a 
flow conduit of a well. Known locking systems are described in US patents 
nos. 2,673,614 (to Ira A. Miller) and 3,208,531 (to Jack W. 
Tamplen). In both these systems, the running tool moves the 
lock mandrel downwardly into sealing and locking engagement 
with a compatible landing nipple in a well flow conduit. Our European application 91306289.9 describes and 
claims a rotary locking system which comprises: 
(a) a landing nipple having connecting means for 
connecting the nipple in a conduit, first locking 
means and a metal seat; (b) lock mandrel means having a metal sealing surface 
which is sealingly engageable with the metal seat 
in the landing nipple and second locking means; 
and (c) running tool means having a connector assembly; 
wherein the connector assembly of the running tool 
means is engageable with the lock mandrel means 
and rotatable to rotate the lock mandrel means to 
bring the second locking means into engagement 
with the first locking means of the landing 
nipple, and to bring the metal seat into seal with 
the sealing surface; and said connecting assembly 
is releasable from engagement with said lock  
 
mandrel means on application of a rotating force 
by said running tool means on said lock mandrel 
means. This application, which is divided therefrom, 
relates to a lock mandrel suitable for use with such 
systems, and, in particular, a lock mandrel arranged for 
releasable locking engagement with a compatible landing 
nipple in a conduit, said lock mandrel having a longitudinal 
flow passage therethrough and being characterised in that it 
includes: 
(a) an upper mandrel having openings therein; (b) helically profiled segment means for rotatably 
orienting and locking said locking mandrel in said 
landing nipple, said segment means being mounted 
for radial movement in each said opening; (c) a support slidably mounted and releasably 
positioned in a first position in said mandrel for 
expanding said profiled segment means, said 
support being longitudinally moveable to a second 
position permitting said profiled segment means to 
be moved to a retracted position; (d) a lower body having a metal sealing surface 
thereon; (e) means swivelably connecting said lower body to 
said upper mandrel; and (f) force transmitting means (W) between said upper 
mandrel and said body. In order to locate the lock mandrel

<CLAIMS>
A lock mandrel (15) arranged for releasable 
locking engagement with a compatible landing nipple (10) in 

a conduit, said lock mandrel having a longitudinal flow 
passage (15a) therethrough and being characterised in that 

it includes: 

(a) an upper mandrel (17) having openings (18) 
therein; 
(b) helically profiled segment means (19) for 
rotatably orienting and locking said locking 

mandrel in said landing nipple, said segment means 
being mounted for radial movement in each said 

opening; 
(c) a support (22) slidably mounted and releasably 
positioned in a first position in said mandrel for 

expanding said profiled segment means (19), said 
support being longitudinally moveable to a second 

position permitting said profiled segment means to 
be moved to a retracted position; 
(d) a lower body (26) having a metal sealing surface 
(26a) thereon; 
(e) means (24) swivelably connecting said lower body 
to said upper mandrel; and 
(f) force transmitting means (W) between said upper 
mandrel and said body. 
A lock mandrel as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
lock mandrel is a rotary lock mandrel.
