<ABSTRACT>
Pressure fluid operated impact mechanism having a reciprocating working member
(5), a stop member (17) and, formed between said members, a drive chamber (18)

with seals (15, 16) and a regulating valve (21) co-operating with a supply opening (25)
for pressure fluid, in which opening a sleeve (24) can be arranged for the journalling

of the valve. The valve blocks the opening when the working member (5) and the stop
member (17) have moved a distance away from each other and is open when they are

close to each other. Through the valve and the working member, a discharge channel
(33, 31, 20, 32) for pressure fluid is provided which is closed when its inlet opening

(33) is inside the stop member and is freed when the working and stop members have
moved a distance away from each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure fluid operated impact mechanism of
the type which comprises a working member arranged to reciprocate in relation to a
stop member which can also describe a reciprocating movement, and at least one
sealing member co-operating with the first-mentioned members to form a drive chamber
between those. Pressure fluid is supplied to the drive chamber through an opening
in the stop member, and forming part of the drive mechanism is also a regulating
valve which in the region of a rear end position of the movement of the working
member is open for the supply of pressure fluid to the drive chamber and which in the
region of a forward end position of said movement blocks said supply. Furthermore, a
spring is arranged to press the working member against the stop member, and if the
latter is movably arranged it, too, can be fitted with a spring which presses it against
the working member; i.e. in this case the two springs press the two members against
each other.An impact mechanism of the said type operates in such a way that the working
member, acted upon by the pressure fluid, makes a forward movement during the first
stage of which the regulating valve is open for the supply of pressure fluid to the drive
chamber, which is otherwise closed by the seal or seals. During a second stage the
supply of pressure fluid is stopped, and the drive chamber is opened for the discharge
of pressure fluid. The forward movement of the working member is interrupted and
replaced by a return movement. At the final stage of this movement the drive chamber
is again closed, and the regulating valve opens for renewed supply of pressure fluid
and a new forward movement. If the stop member is also movably arranged, it will
make a rearward movement simultaneously with the forward movement of the working
member, and vice versa.Impact mechanisms of the abovementioned type are known, in which the drive
chamber is emptied radially - see for example the Swedish patent No. 501 449. In
these mechanisms, a ring-shaped opening must be provided between a housing enclosing
the mechanism and the peripheral walls of the mechanism's drive chamber, so that
pressure fluid can pass through this opening towards one or more discharge openings
provided in the tool. This results in increased diameter of the tool housing which, for 
one thing, increases the price of the tool and, for another thing, results in an undesired
weight increase. A larger dimension entails an increased cost of material, but above all
it

<CLAIMS>
Pressure fluid operated impact mechanism of the type which comprises a reciprocating
working member (5) describing forward movements away from and return

movements towards a stop member (17) which can also describe a reciprocating
movement, and at least one sealing member (15, 16) co-operating with the first-mentioned

members (5, 17) to form a drive chamber (18) between those, to which
chamber pressure fluid is supplied through an opening (25) in the stop member (17), a

regulating valve member (21) fastened with one end in, and following the movements

of, said working member (5) and extending with an opposite end into the
opening (25), said valve member (21) permitting supply of pressure fluid to the drive

chamber (18) when the working member (5) is in the region of an end position of said
return movement, and blocking said supply when the working member (5) is in the

region of an end position of said forward movement, and a first spring (13) arranged to
press the working member (5) against the stop member (17), in addition to which a

second spring (34) can be arranged to press the stop member (17), which in such a
case is arranged to be able to reciprocate in relation to the working member (5),

against said working member, 
characterized in that
 an exhaust channel (33, 31, 20,
32) from the drive chamber (18) is provided through the regulating valve member (21)

and the working member (5), at least one inlet (33) to said channel being provided in
the regulating valve member (21) in such a way that said inlet (33) is inside the stop

member (17) and is blocked when the working member (5) is in the region of said end
position of its return movement, and that said inlet (33) is inside the drive chamber

(18) and is free to receive pressure fluid from said chamber (18) when the working
member (5) is in the region of said end position of its forward movement.
Impact mechanism in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterized in that

in the opening (25) of the stop member (5) a sleeve (24) for the journalling of the
regulating valve member (21) is arranged with a play against the opening (25) and retained

with limited movability with the help of a flexible retaining member, such as a
seal ring (22), said blocking of the inlet (33) of the regulating valve member (21) being 

caused thereby that said inlet (33) is inside said sleeve (24) when the working
member (5) is in the region of said end position of its return movement.
Impact mechanism in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 two
sealing members (15, 16) are provided in the drive chamber (18), each sealing member

(15, 16) supporting with one side against supporting surfaces of an intermediate ring
(14) provided between them, and with an opposite side against supporting surfaces

along an end surface of the working member (5) and the stop member (17), respectively,
and also supporting with peripheral surfaces against an inner wall (56) of a

housing (1) enclosing said impact mechanism, the supporting surfaces of the intermediate
ring (14) against the sealing members (15, 16) being smaller than the supporting

surfaces of the working member (5) and the stop member (17) against said sealing
members (15, 16), the sealing members (15, 16) thereby, by the action of the pressure

fluid, being held constantly pressed against the larger supporting surfaces of the
working and stop members (5, 17) during said reciprocating movement and in sealing

contact with and gliding along the inner wall (56).
Impact mechanism in accordance with any of the foregoing Claims, 
characterized
in that
 the regulating valve member (21) is flexibly connected to the working
member (5) in order to be capable of adjusting its position in relation to the opening

(25) of the working member (17) or the sleeve (24), respectively.
