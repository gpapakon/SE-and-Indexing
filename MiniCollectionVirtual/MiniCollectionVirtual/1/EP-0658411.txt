<ABSTRACT>
Porous articles made of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene are obtained by injection moulding polyethylenes with a limiting viscosity number from 500 to 5,000 ml/g, an average grain size of 100 to 1,500  mu m and an apparent density of at least 0.35 g/cm

>
. The processing of the polymer takes place in an injection-moulding machine at 160 to 260 DEG C and an injection pressure of 80 to 150 mPa. During this operation, the ratio of the flow length of the material in the injection mould to the wall thickness of the moulded article is not greater than 7.5.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of porous moldings of
pulverulent, ultrahigh-molecular-weight

polyethylene by injection molding, which comprises
processing polyethylene having an intrinsic

viscosity of from 500 to 5000 ml/g, a mean particle
size of from 100 to 1500 µm and a bulk density of

at least 0.35 g/cm
3
 in an injection-molding machine
at from 160 to 260°C and an injection pressure of

from 80 to 150 MPa, where the ratio between the
flow distance of the material in the injection mold

and the wall thickness of the molding is not
greater than 7.5.
The process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
intrinsic viscosity of the polyethylene is from

1300 to 3000 ml/g.
The process as claimed in one or more of patent
claims 1 and 2, wherein the mean particle size of

the polyethylene particles is from 200 to 1000 µm.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1
to 3, wherein the bulk density of the pulverulent,

ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene is from 0.4
to 0.6 g/cm
3
. 
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1
to 4, wherein the processing temperature is from

190 to 220°C.
The process as claimed in one or more of claims 1
to 5, wherein the injection pressure is from 100 to

120 MPa.
The process as claimed in one or more of patent
claims 1 to 6, wherein the internal pressure in the

mold does not exceed 0.05 MPa.
