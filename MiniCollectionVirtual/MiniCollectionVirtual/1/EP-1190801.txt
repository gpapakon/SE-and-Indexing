<ABSTRACT>
A device for applying solder paste on to circuit boards by means of a transfer device which can traverse relative to the circuit boards, and generates a specified solder paste pattern by means of a number of time-successive transfer procedures. The transfer device comprises a paste carrier with a number of paste chambers filled with solder paste and 'print head' for transferring the solder paste from selectable paste chambers on to the circuit board.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for applying solder paste to a printed
circuit board (LP) by means of a transfer device (TE)

which comprises a paste carrier (PT) and a pressure
head (DK), having the features


a) the paste carrier (PT) has a plurality of paste
chambers (PK) filled with solder paste (PA),
b) the pressure head (DK) can transfer solder paste
from selectable paste chambers to the printed

circuit board (LP) by means of at least one
transfer element (DN),
c) the paste carrier (PT) is movable relative to the
pressure head (DK), and the number of transfer

elements is less than 5% of the number of paste
chambers,
d) the transfer device is movable relative to the
printed circuit board,
e) the transfer device can produce a predeterminable
paste pattern on the printed circuit board by a

plurality of successive transfer operations.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the transfer element is displaceable through the
paste chamber perpendicularly to the printed circuit

board. 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the transfer element has a wire-shaped section
facing the printed circuit board.
Apparatus according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized
in that
 the number of transfer elements of the pressure
head is less than 1% of the number of paste chambers.
Apparatus according to Claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 a plurality of transfer elements are arranged in
at least one row running transversely to the direction

of movement of the paste carrier.
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized
in that
 the movement of the paste carrier is effected

progressively and is interrupted for a transfer
operation.
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized
in that
 the movement of the paste carrier is effected
continuously, and those ends of the transfer elements

which face the paste carrier run uniformly with the
paste carrier in the direction of movement at least

during the transfer operation.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the paste carrier projects from a
carrier disc as an annular shell which is circular

symmetric about an axis of rotation.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8,

characterized by
 a filling device for filling empty
paste chambers.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 9,

characterized in that
 means are provided for performing
an additional relative movement of transfer device and

printed circuit board in the printed-circuit-board 
plane with a small amplitude relative to the diameter

of a paste chamber.
