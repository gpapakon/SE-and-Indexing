<ABSTRACT>
Silver halide emulsions are disclosed in 
which at least 50 percent of total grain projected area 

is accounted for by tabular grains (1) bounded by {100} 
major
 faces having adjacent edge ratios of less than 
10, (2) each having an aspect ratio of at least 2 and 

together having an average aspect ratio of up to 8, and 
(3) internally at their nucleation site containing 

iodide and at least 50 mole percent chloride. The 
emulsions are prepared by a process comprised of the 

steps of (a) introducing silver and halide salts into a 
dispersing medium so that nucleation of the tabular 

grains occurs in the presence of iodide with chloride 
accounting for at least 50 mole percent of the halide 

present in the dispersing medium and the pCl of the 
dispersing medium being maintained in the range of from 

0.5 to 3.5 and (b) following nucleation completing 
grain growth under conditions that maintain the {100} 

major faces of the tabular grains, grain growth being 
continued until the tabular grains have an average 

aspect ratio of up to 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radiation sensitive 
silver halide emulsions. During the 1980's a marked advance took place 
in silver halide photography based on the discovery 
that a wide range of photographic advantages, such as 
improved speed-granularity relationships, increased 
covering power both on an absolute basis and as a 
function of binder hardening, more rapid developability, 
increased thermal stability, increased separation 
of native and spectral sensitization imparted 
imaging speeds, and improved image sharpness in both 
mono- and multi-emulsion layer formats, can be achieved 
by employing tabular grain emulsions. An emulsion is generally understood to be a 
"tabular grain emulsion" when tabular grains account 
for at least 50 percent of total grain projected area. 
A grain is generally considered to be a tabular grain 
when the ratio of its equivalent circular diameter 
(ECD) to its thickness (t) is at least 2. The equivalent 
circular diameter of a grain is the diameter of a 
circle having an area equal to the projected area of 
the grain. The term "intermediate aspect ratio tabular 
grain emulsion" refers to an emulsion which has an 
average tabular grain aspect ratio in the range of from 
5 to 8. The term "thin tabular grain" is generally 
understood to be a tabular grain having a thickness of 
less than 0.2 µm. The term "ultrathin tabular grain" 
is generally understood to be a tabular grain having a 
thickness of 0.06 µm or less. The term "high chloride" 
refers to grains that contain at least 50 mole percent 
chloride based on silver. In referring to grains of 
mixed halide content, the halides are named in order of 
increasing molar concentrations--e.g., silver iodochloride 
contains a higher molar concentration of chloride 
than iodide.  The overwhelming majority of tabular grain 
emulsions contain tabular grains that are irregular 
octahedral grains. Regular octahedral grains contain 
eight identical crystal faces, each lying in a different 
{111} crystallographic plane. Tabular irregular 
octahedra contain two or more parallel twin planes that 
separate two major grain faces lying in {111} crystallographic 
planes. The {111} major faces of the tabular 
grains exhibit a threefold symmetry, appearing triangular 
or hexagonal. It is generally accepted that the 
tabular shape of the grains is the result of the twin 
planes producing favored edge sites for silver halide 
deposition, with the result that the grains grow 
laterally while increasing little, if any, in thickness 
after
