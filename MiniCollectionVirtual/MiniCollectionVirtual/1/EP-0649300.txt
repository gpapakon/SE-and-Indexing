<CLAIMS>
Use, in the preparation of a poly(lactic acid)-based 
bioresorbable implantable membrane, intended to 

enhance the regeneration of the periodontal tissue and/or 
of the maxillae according to the technique of guided 

tissue regeneration, of a mixture of a first amorphous 
poly(lactic acid) having a molecular mass of at least 

20,000, and of a second amorphous poly(lactic acid) 
having a molecular mass not exceeding 5000, the said 

mixture comprising a sufficient proportion of the said 
second poly(lactic acid) so that the membrane has the 

desired degree of flexibility at a temperature not 
exceeding 37Â°C. 
Use according to Claim 1, characterized by the 
fact that the said first and second poly(lactic acids) 

consist of a mixture of units derived from D- and 
L-lactic acids, the proportion of D-lactic units being at 

least sufficient for the said poly(lactic acids) to be 
amorphous. 
Use according to the preceding claim, characterizad 
by the fact that the said first and second 

poly(lactic acids) contain 30 to 70% of D-lactic units. 
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized 
by the fact that the said first and second 

poly(lactic acids) contain, in equal proportions, units 
derived from D- and L-lactic acids. 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said mixture contains 

10 to 60% by weight of the said second poly(lactic acid). 
Use according to Claim 5, characterized by the 
fact that the composition of the said mixture is adjusted  

 
as a function of the desired rate of resorption for the 

implanted membrane, it being understood that the resorption 
is more rapid the higher the proportion of the 

second poly(lactic acid) and the lower its molecular 
mass. 
Use according to Claim 5, in the preparation of 
a membrane intended for the regeneration of the periodontal 

tissue, characterized by the fact that the said 
mixture contains from 20 to 60%, and in particular from 

20 to 50% by weight of the said second poly(lactic acid). 
Use according to the preceding claim, characterized 
by the fact that the said mixture contains from 

25 to 50% by weight of the said second poly(lactic acid). 
Use according to Claim 5, in the preparation of 
a membrane intended for the regeneration of the maxillae, 

characterized by the fact that the mixture contains from 
10 to 20% by weight of the said second poly(lactic acid). 
Use according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by the fact that the said membrane is 

prepared in the form of a film having a thickness which 
may range from 0.05 to 0.5 mm, and in particular from 0.1 

to 0.3 mm.
