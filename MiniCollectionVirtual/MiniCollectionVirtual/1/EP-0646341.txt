<ABSTRACT>
The support system, according to the invention, for a piece of sleeping or sitting furniture, in particular for a bed, consists of a multiplicity of supporting elements (1), for example slats, and at least two resilient bodies (2), the resilient bodies (2) being arranged transversely to the slats and the slats lying on the resilient bodies and being affixed thereto. In this arrangement, the slats have in cross-section, according to the invention, a seesaw profile and are fixed to the resilient bodies in such a way that they are pivotable to a limited extent with respect to the resilient bodies about an axis running parallel to the slat longitudinal axis. As a result of this pivoting possibility, each slat receives a further degree of freedom, allowing it to further adapt to the shape of a body resting on the slat support system as is possible through the elasticity of the resilient bodies. The lying or sitting comfort of the support system according to the invention is thus increased.
