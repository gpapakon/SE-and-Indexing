<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of the areas of different light 
reflectivity of a bar code symbol, or the like, are 

simultaneously illuminated, using, e.g., a beam of laser 
light that has an elongated cross-section. The laser light 

beam is swept over the symbol in a direction transverse to 
the elongated dimension of the illuminated region so that a 

two-dimensional area of the symbol is illuminated over time, 
until the symbol is read. The light that reflects from the 

illuminated region of the symbol is imaged on a linear 
sensor array, which is then scanned or read out to produce 

signals representative of spatial intensity variations of 
the imaged light along a linear path in the field of view.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to bar code readers.Typically, bar code symbols are formed from bars or
elements that are typically rectangular in shape with a
variety of possible widths. The specific arrangement of
these elements defines a character according to a set of
rules and definitions specified by the code or "symbology"
used. The relative size of the bars and spaces is
determined by the type of coding used, as is the actual size
of the bars and spaces. The number of characters per inch
represented by the bar code symbol is referred to as the
density of the symbol. To encode a desired sequence of
characters, groups of elements are concatenated together to
form the complete bar code symbol, with each character of
the message being represented by its own corresponding group
of elements. In some symbologies, unique "start" and "stop"
characters are used to indicate where the bar code begins
and ends. A number of different bar code symbologies exist.
These symbologies include, e.g., UPC/EAN, Code 39, Code 49,
Code 128, Codabar, and Interleaved 2 of 5.In order to increase the amount of data that can be
represented, or stored, on a given amount of surface area,
several new bar code symbologies have recently been
developed. One of these code standards, PDF 417 (developed
by the present assignee), uses a "two-dimensional" scheme in
which rows of characters are stacked vertically. That is, 
there are several rows of bar and space patterns, instead of
only one row.Thus, bar codes include not only the traditional
rectangularly-shaped bars and spaces, but any form of symbol
in which different portions of the symbol have different
light reflecting characteristics.Bar codes are typically scanned to transform the
graphic symbol elements into electrical signals, which are
then decoded into characters. A scanning system uses a
light source, typically a laser, which is directed to the
symbol or bar code by lenses or other optical components.
The reader functions by repetitively scanning the light beam
in a path or series of paths across the symbol. Scanning
systems also include a sensor or photodetector which detects
light reflected from the symbol. A portion of the reflected
light is detected and converted into an electrical signal,
and electronic circuitry or software decodes the electrical
signal into a digital representation. The symbol is decoded
according to the coding technique used.For example, in a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar
code typical on many supermarket items, the first five
digits indicate the
