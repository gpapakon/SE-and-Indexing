<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions
containing a silicate softening system. More in particular,
the present invention relates to softening through the wash
detergent compositions comprising layered silicates and
flocculating polymers.Detergent compositions providing fabric softening throughout
the wash cycle have been described in art. In particular,
clays are well known as fabric softening agents through the
wash. The relative ability of the softening clays to meet
various performance criteria is very much depending on the
presence and concentration of adjunct detergent ingredients.
An example of such adjunct detergent ingredient is the
presence of nonionic surfactants.
Said nonionic surfactants, when used at substantial
concentrations inhibit the deposition of the clay onto the
fabric. So far it was therefore necessary to limit the level
of nonionic surfactants in clay containing softening through
the wash compositions. It has now been found that the combination of layered
silicate and a flocculating polymer provide an efficient
softening system which is fully compatible with nonionic
surfactants. This finding allows to formulate detergent
compositions which have both excellent softening and cleaning
performance.Another type of adjunct detergent ingredient that can be
added to detergent compositions are dye transfer inhibiting
polymers. Said polymers are added to detergent compositions in
order to inhibit the transfer of dyes from colored fabrics
onto other fabrics washed therewith. These polymers have the
ability to complex or adsorb the fugitive dyes washed out of
dyed fabrics before the dyes have the opportunity to become
attached to other articles in the wash.Polymers have been used within detergent compositions to
inhibit dye transfer. Examples of such polymers are
vinylpyrrolidone polymers such as described EP-A-265 257 and
EP-A-508 034. Unfortunately, said vinylpyrrolidone polymers tend
to interact with the clays formulated therewith. Accordingly,
the dye transfer inhibiting performance of the polymers and
the softening performance of the clays are negatively
affected.It has now been found that polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers are
very compatible with the silicate softening system in that the
dye transfer inhibiting performance of the polymers is not
negatively affected in the presence of the silicate softening
system. In addition, it has been found that the softening
performance of layered silicates formulated with dye transfer
inhibiting polymers has been maintained.This
