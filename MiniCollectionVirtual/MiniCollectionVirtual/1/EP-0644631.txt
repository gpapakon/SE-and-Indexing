<ABSTRACT>
A connection element (14a, 14b), for end of wire, comprises a channel (17) for the said end of wire (FB), defined between two lugs (fasteners) (15) located opposite each other and connected to each other by a connecting part (15') constituting the bottom of the channel. The said lugs are intended to be folded over towards each other with a view to clamping the said end of wire. According to the invention, at least one of the lugs (15) includes, level with at least one lateral edge and near the said connecting part (15'), a notch (16) for accommodating part of the end of wire, bent over through approximately 180 DEG  and located between a first part of the end of wire extending inside the channel and a second part of the end of wire extending outside the channel.

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a wire and a connexion element (14a, 14b) for an end
of the wire, of the type comprising a channel (17) for said end of the wire

(FB), defined between two tabs (15) situated facing each other and
interconnected by a link portion (15') constituting the web of the channel,

said tabs being designed to be folded towards each other in order to clamp
said end of the wire, at least one of the tabs (15) including, in at least one

lateral edge thereof, a notch (16), the combination being characterized in
that, the or each, notch extends close to said link portion (15') and is

adapted to receive a portion of the end of the wire that is bent through
about 180Â° in order to position the wire in the channel, said portion of

the end of the wire being situated between a first portion of the end of the
wire extending inside the channel and a second portion of the end of the

wire extending outside the channel.
A combination according to claim 1, characterized in that each of the
two tabs (15) includes a notch (16).
A combination according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the, or
each, notch (16) is semicircular in shape.
A combination according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that said first portion of the end of the wire terminates said end, with the

channel (17) flaring from a side edge of each tab (15) that does not include
a notch towards an opposite side edge of each said tabs that does include

the, or each, notch (16).
A combination according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in

that the connexion element has a U-shaped profile in section across the
channel (17).
A combination according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that each tab (15) includes a projection (151) on its face that faces

towards the inside of the channel.
A combination of a wire and of a rigid conductor (123a, 123b),
characterized in that the conductor has one end terminated by a

connexion element combined with the wire according to any one to claims 
1 to 6, and in that the, or each, notch (16) is directed towards said rigid

conductor.
An add-on collector for an alternator, in particular for a motor vehicle,
the collector being of the type made by overmolding an insulating material

onto electrically conductive elements, and comprising a first generally
cylindrical portion (10a, 10b, 20, 22) including two collector rings (10a,

10b) on its outside surface, a second portion (34, 14a, 14b) including two
connexion elements for connection with the wire ends (FB) of a winding,

and an intermediate portion (12a, 12b, 32a, 32b) for electrically and
mechanically interconnecting the first and second portions, each

comprising two arms constituted by a conductive link portion (12a, 12b)
between the ring and the connexion element embedded in the insulating

material (32a, 32b), characterized in that it comprises two combinations of
a wire and a connexion element according to any one of claims 1 to 6, or

two combinations of a wire and a rigid conductor according to claim 7.
An alternator (A), in particular for a motor vehicle, characterized in
that it includes on a projecting shaft (AR) an add-on collector (1) according

to claim 8.
