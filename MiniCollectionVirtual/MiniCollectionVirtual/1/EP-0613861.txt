<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for at least partially desalinating drinking water for foodstuffs preparation having a receiver (1) for taking up filtered drinking water and having a top (2) which consists of an essentially funnel-shaped upper part which in its bottom (14) has a receiving orifice (5) for a filter cartridge (6). To provide a correspondingly simple device by means of which even laypersons are easily able both to filter drinking water for foodstuffs preparation in a conventional manner and, if necessary, in particular for the preparation of baby food, to obtain drinking water in largely desalinated form, it is proposed according to the invention that a second top (3) be provided, which can be mounted on the first top or can be inserted between the first top (2) and the receiver (1), and which likewise has a funnel-shaped part having a bottom orifice (5') in which a second filter cartridge (7) can be inserted.
