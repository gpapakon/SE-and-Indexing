<ABSTRACT>
A basketball training device is described for improving the shooting skills 
of the user including an elongated member (12) adapted to be strapped to the 

user's forearm and a hemispherical finger and hand engagement element (64) 
configured as a portion of a basketball facing the elongate member so as to 

be engagable with the user's fingers and hand. A resistance member (32) 
pivotally mounts the hemispherical engagement element to resist movement from 

an inclined position to allow the user to flex the hand, fingers and wrist 
against the resistance in a manner closely simulating the execution of a 

basketball shot. An elbow rest (20) is adjustably mounted at the opposite 
end of the elongate member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns training and exercising devices used 
as aids in increasing the shooting skill of a basketball player. 
Shooting skill improvement is usually achieved by sessions on the 
basketball court practicing the various shots, combined with 
general exercise, conditioning, and strengthening programs. Heretofore it has been recognized that the execution of a 
physical skill is enhanced by the strengthening of the muscle 
groups involved. In recognition of this fact, exercising devices 
specifically directed to development of the hand and wrist muscle 
groups have been devised. However, heretofore these prior exercise 
devices have not sufficiently simulated the basketball shot motion 
to be of maximum effectiveness particularly in regards to the hand 
and finger muscles. It would be useful if such exercising devices closely 
simulated the shot motion itself such as to contribute to the 
process of teaching the shot motion by repetition such as to 
provide an approximation of the benefit of actual practice shots. Therefore it is an object of the present invention to provide 
a basketball training and exercising device which in use closely 
simulates the shot motion, such as to develop the precise muscle 
groups in the fingers, hand, wrist, and arm necessary to execute 
the basketball shot such as to cause development of those muscle 
groups and thereby enable improved basketball shooting skills. It is a further object to provide a basketball training device 
which in use closely approximates the execution of the shot motion 
such that its use also contributes to the physical learning 
process. These and other objects of the present invention are achieved 
by a basketball training device comprising an elongated member  
 
adapted to be strapped or otherwise secured to the forearm of the 
user, with a elbow anchoring rest mounted at one end of the 
elongated member, preferably adjustably mounted to be fit to the 
size of the individual user. An inclined resistance member is pivotally mounted at the 
opposite end of the elongated forearm attaching member so as to be 
able to be swung towards and away from the side of the elongate 
member against which the user's forearm is secured. A resilient resistance means resists away swinging movement of 
the resistance member on its pivotal mount in a direction so as to 
be more nearly parallel to the elongated member. Attached to the free end of the resistance member, is a hand 
and finger engagement element, defining a generally spherical 
surface

<CLAIMS>
A basketball training device comprising: 
   an elongate member; 

   forearm securement means for detachably securing said elongate 
member to the forearm of a user; 

   a resistance member pivotally mounted to one end of said 
elongate member so as to be swingable between a retracted position 

inclined from said elongate member to an extended position more 
nearly parallel thereto; 

   resilient means generating a resilient force resisting 
swinging of said resistance member away from said retracted 

position inclined with respect to said elongate member to said 
extended position more nearly parallel thereto; 

   a finger and hand engagement element fixed to said resistance 
member having a finger and hand engagement surface comprising a 

spherically curving surface non rotatably fixed relative said 
resistance member and facing towards said elongate member with said 

resistance member inclined with respect thereto, said spherically 
curved shape able to be engaged by all of the fingers including the 

thumb, and the palm of the hand of a person having a forearm 
secured to said elongate member with said resistance member in said 

retracted position, to enable pushing of said engagement element 
and resistance member against the force of said resilient means to 

provide resistance exercising of the wrist, forearm, fingers and 
hand as said resistance member is swung between said retracted and 

extended positions. 
The basketball training device according to claim 1 
wherein said engagement surface comprises a hemispherical surface 

thereof facing said elongate element and positioned to be engaged 
with all of the fingers including the thumb and the palm of the 

hand with said elongate member secured to the forearm during use 
thereof. 
The basketball training device according to claim 1 or 2 
further including an elbow rest affixed to an end of said elongate 

member opposite said end whereat said resistance member is 
 

pivotally mounted. 
The basketball training devie according to claim 3 
wherein said elbow rest is adjustably mounted to said elongate 

member to enable adjustment in the lengthwise position thereof. 
The basketball training device according to one of the claims 1 to 4 
wherein said elongate member comprises a padded surface on one side 

thereof against which a forearm may be secured. 
The basketball training device according to claim 5 
wherein said forearm securement means comprises a series of straps 

and means for securing such straps encircling the user's forearm 
pressed against said elongate member. 
The basketball training device according to one of the claims 2 to 6 
wherein said finger and hand engagement element comprises a 

hemispherical member having a convex portion comprising said finger 
and hand engagement surface thereof facing toward said elongate 

member with said resistance member in an inclined position with 
respect thereto. 
The basketball training device according to one of the claims 1 to 7 
wherein said resistance member comprises a frame including a pair 

of arms extending outwardly away from said elongate member and 
wherein said resistance means comprises a resilient strap passing 

around said arms and anchored at either end to said elongate 
member. 
The basketball training device according to one of the claims 2 to 8 
wherein said engagement element comprises at least a portion of a 

standard basketball affixed to said resistance member.
