<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a facsimile apparatus 
capable of economizing the power required for the 

heater for heat fixation of the recorded image. 
Instead of continuous heating, the heater is activated 

in response to a particular signal in the received 
message, and is deactivated after the recording of 

a page, or plural pages in case of a continuous 
receiving operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus for forming a visible image on a recording
material according to received signals and fixing said
visible image by heat.In conventional recording apparatus, such as
facsimile apparatus, utilizing thermal image fixation,
such as a laser beam printer utilizing plain paper
for recording, the image fixing heater has to be
always turned on because the temperature elevation
thereof is slow. Thus the heater is so designed as
to be continuously turned on to maintain a constant
temperature regardless whether the facsimile
apparatus is in the stand-by, receiving or transmitting
state.Such continuous energization of the fixing
heater leads to following drawbacks:
(1) A high electric power consumption, giving rise
to a high running cost;(2) The operation becomes very uneconomical in
the facsimile apparatus if the percentage of
transmission is high, because the fixing heater is 
turned on during the stand-by state and transmission
state, though the recording is required only in the
reception and copying mode; and(3) cooling for example with a fan is indispensable
for avoiding temperature increase in the apparatus,
and the dimension of the apparatus is inevitably
increased for this reason.JP-A-63 063 276 and JP-A-61 029 261 describe facsimile devices in which
the fixing heater is powered upon an incoming fax call.In consideration of the foregoing, an object
of the present invention is to provide an improved
recording apparatus.Another object of the present invention is
to provide a recording apparatus capable of reducing
the electric power consumption.Still another object of the present invention
is to provide a recording apparatus capable of
preventing temperature increase therein.Still another object of the present invention
is to provide a recording apparatus forming an image
by an electrophotographic process, capable of
energizing image fixing means in response to a
received signal.Still another object of the present invention
is to provide a recording apparatus capable of
energizing image fixing means at every predetermined
communication unit. Still another object of the present invention
is to provide a recording apparatus capable of heating
control for image fixing means according to the
communication mode.Still another object of the present invention
is to provide a recording apparatus in which the power
supply to image fixing means is turned off in the
substituted reception mode.The foregoing and still other objects of the
present invention, and the

<CLAIMS>
A facsimile apparatus comprising:

communication means (3) for receiving through a
communication line transmitted image data from a remote

communication apparatus;
recording means (5) for forming a visible image on a
recording material (P) according to the image data which is

transmitted from the remote communication apparatus and
received by said communication means (3); and
fixing means (14) for heat-fixing the visible image formed
on the recording material (P) by said recording means (5);
characterized in that

said facsimile apparatus has a plurality of communication modes
which are represented by different control data signaling what

kind of image data is transmitted, wherein control means (7)
control the timing of the heating by said fixing means (14)

according to the content of said received image data
determining said communication mode.
An apparatus according to claim 1,
characterized by

storing means (6) for storing the image data received by said
communication means (3), wherein said control means (7) is

adapted to prohibit said control of heating of said fixing
means (14) in a substituted reception mode, said substituted

reception mode being a mode in which the received image data is
stored in said storing means (6) without being recorded by said

recording means (5). 
An apparatus according to claim 1,
characterized in that

said control means (7) starts the heating by said fixing means
(14) after reception of a call.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

generating heat by electric power supply, a heat-resistant

sheet (19) and pressurizing means (18), opposed to and
maintained in pressure contact with said heating member (8),

for maintaining said recording material (P) in close contact
with said heating member (8) across said heat resistant sheet

(19).
An apparatus according to claim 4,
characterized in that

said control means (7) is adapted to vary the time of start of
power supply to said fixing means (14) according to said

communication mode.
An apparatus according to claim 1,
characterized by

storing means (6) for storing the image data received by said
communication means (3), wherein said control means (7) is

adapted to interrupt the control of heating by said fixing
means (14) when a substituted reception mode is selected during

an image data reception operation, said substituted reception
mode being a mode in which the received image data is stored in

said storing means (6) without being recorded by said recording
means (5). 
An apparatus according to claim 6,
characterized in that

said fixing means (14) comprises a heating member (8)
generating heat by electric power supply, and said control

means (7) is adapted to turn on and off the power supply to
said heating member (8) at every predetermined communication

unit and to turn off the power supply to said heating member
(8) when said substituted reception mode is selected.
An apparatus according to claim 6 or 7,
characterized by

detection means (20) for detecting absence of the recording
material (P), wherein the substituted reception mode is

selected in response to a detection signal from said detection
means (20).
An apparatus according to claim 6 or 7,
