<ABSTRACT>
An improved radial ply pneumatic tire 30 is 
described. The improved tire 30 has a first annular 

surface 23 located between the heel 22B and toe 22A of 
each bead 33 and a second surface 24 extending 

radially outwardly from the bead heel 22B. The first 
surface 23 is designed to be in contact with the bead 

seat 42 of the design rim 40 when the tire 30 is 
mounted and inflated to normal pressure. The first 

annular surface 23, when the tire 30 is unmounted, 
forms an average angle β with the axis of the tire, 

when the beads 33 are axially spaced a distance D 
equal to the design rim width as defined herein. The 

average angle β is in the range of at least one-half 
degree and less than three degrees greater than the 

angle formed between the mating bead seat 42 of the 
design rim 40 and the axis of the tire. The second 

surface 24 is designed to be in contact with an 
annular flange 44 portion of the design rim 40 when 

the tire is mounted and inflated to normal pressure. 
The second surface 24 is perpendicular to the axis of 

rotation. 
Preferably the angle β is in the range of 1° to 
2° greater than the rim seat angle, more preferably 

the angle β is 1.5° greater. The angular 
relationships relative to the design rim flange 44 

permit the bead 33 to exhibit uniform compression upon 
mounting to the design rim 40, thereby improving the 

stiffness and handling characteristics of the tire 30.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic radial ply
tires and the interrelationship between the tire and
its design rim.Historically, with the introduction of the
tubeless type tire, the design fitment of the bead
portions of the tire to the design rim has increased
in significance. This fitment insures that the tire
remains air tightly sealed and securely fixed to the
rim during vehicle use.The typical rim has a bead seat and a rim flange
that defines the contact zone with the tire bead. The
tire bead has an annular surface between the bead heel
and bead toe that upon assembly to the rim contacts
the bead seat. The bead also has an annular surface
radially outwardly of the bead heel, this annular
surface contacts the rim flange when the tire is
mounted and inflated on the rim.The prior art teaches the use of a rim with
cylindrical or very slightly conical bead seats.
Typically such bead seats were inclined at an angle of
5° relative to the axis of rotation of the tire. To
ensure a proper fitment, the tire beads had an annular
surface having a similar 5° inclination relative to
the axis of rotation, the beads having a slightly
smaller diameter than the rim seat, thus upon
assembly, a snug interference fit would be achieved.
Such a prior art tire is shown in Figure 3A.As a later development, the radially innermost
flexible toe portion of the tire between the toe and
the annular tensile member comprised an inclined
surface about 5° greater than the rim seat. This 
added interference created by the angular variation
facilitated sealing the tire. This prior art tire is
illustrated in Figures 3B and 3C.The prior art tires had beads with a surface
radially outwardly of the bead heel. This surface
ideally should contact the rim flange, both the rim
flange and this axially and radially outwardly surface
being oriented at 90° relative to the wheel axis. This
area being under pressure while the tire is inflated over
a portion of its surface, contacts the rim flange
essentially fastening the tire on the rim.The prior art tires essentially relied on the rim
seat and flange orientation to establish the shape and
orientation of the bead, with the exception being the
flexible toe portion of the bead.International polymer science and technology, Rubber
and Plastics Research Association, vol.3, no.1, 1976,
Shrewsbury (GB), pages 73-74, discloses on Fig. 1 a bead
for a tractor or farm tire having one or two bead cores,
no interference on the rim flange and a close fit of the
bead sole on the rim seat.FR-A- 1.158.208 shows a
