<ABSTRACT>
Tread rubber composition for tires, which is 
prepared by the use of rubber components consisting, when 

the weight of the rubber components is assumed to be 100 
parts, of 20 to 80 parts of a diene rubber and 80 to 20 

parts of a styrene-butadiene copolymer having a glass 
transition temperature of from -50 to -25°C and 

satisfying a relation shown by an equation of 4.8X-Y ≧ 
32, in which a bonded styrene content is represented by X 

% by weight and a 1,2-bond content in butadiene portion is 
represented by Y % by weight. Also in the tread rubber 

composition of the present invention, the temperature 
dispersion curve of a tan δ of the rubber composition has 

plural peaks, the temperature difference between the 
highest temperature side peak thereof and a single peak of 

the rubber composition prepared by using the 
above-mentioned styrene-butadiene copolymer alone as a 

rubber component is within 10°C, and the tan δ measured 
at 50°C is 0.08 to 0.20. The tread rubber composition can 

provide tires having a low rolling resistance and an 
excellent grip characteristic on a wet road surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tread rubber
composition for tires, and more specifically to a tread
rubber composition for tires, which makes it possible to
obtain tires having a lowered rolling resistance while
maintaining grip characteristics, specifically those on a
wet road surface.Recently there is an increased demand for saving
of energy resources throughout the world, and so-called
fuel saving tires contributing to lowering of fuel
consumption of cars have been developed. However although
the conventional fuel saving tires are low in rolling
resistance and meet the requirements for lowering fuel
consumption, those tires are inferior in other
characteristics, particularly grip characteristics on a
wet road surface and thus are not satisfactory as a whole.Among tire components, it is a tread that has
the greatest influence on the rolling resistance of the
tire. In order to lower the rolling resistance, it is
effective to decrease an energy loss caused by deformation
of the tread rubber, such as compression and bending
thereof. The rolling resistance of the tire is said to be
usually related to tan δ at a tread rubber temperature of
around the range from 50° to 70°C, and be lowered by
decreasing the tan δ value. Also while the grip
characteristics of the tire on the wet road surface are
influenced by a friction coefficient of the road surface
itself, it is said that such characteristics also have
relation to the tan δ at around 0°C, and therefore
increase in the tan δ value enhances the grip
characteristics.However it is difficult to individually control
the tan δ at around the range from 50° to 70°C and one at
0°C. There is a tendency that when the former is
increased, the latter also increases, and decreases when
the former is decreased. Thus it was difficult to lower 
the rolling resistance and enhance the grip
characteristics at the same time.As a method to reduce an energy loss of the tread in
order to lower the rolling resistance of the tire, there
has been employed, for a tread rubber, a method in which
a styrene-butadiene copolymer having a low glass
transition temperature is blended with polybutadiene, and
natural rubber. However in such a method, though the
rolling resistance was lowered, the tan δ value of the
tread rubber at a temperature of around 0°C became lowered
and the grip characteristics on the wet road surface
remarkably decreased, and thus the tires having the
required characteristics could not be obtained.Tread rubber compositions comprising blends of
