<ABSTRACT>
The packaging has four walls (1-4) with adjoining folding lines (5,6,7) and flaps (10-13) each adjoining a wall by a folding line (14-17) and erected perpendicular to these lines. Each wall has an adjoining band (18-21) which is folded down against the internal or external face of the associated wall. The different bands are joined by a folding line so as to form a continuous girdle inside or outside the packaging. Each wall has a cut-out part (27-30) which form flaps which are joined to the wall by the same folding line as the associated band. These flaps are erected perpendicular to their walls and assembled together to close the packaging parallel to the flaps forming the upper part.
