<ABSTRACT>
A fabric sample press cell comprising a base (1) which cooperates with a cap (9) to enclose a chamber which is relatively narrow. The chamber receives a fabric sample folded back upon itself so that the fabric sample becomes creased. The base (1) is sealingly connected to the cap (9) by means of a resilient circular seal (6) so that the sample is maintained sealingly enclosed within the chamber. Abutting the sample is a metal disc (7) which is backed by a resilient sheet (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CREASE SETTING AND MEASUREMENT FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the setting of creases in fabrics whereby the crease setting performance of a fabric may be reliably tested and thereby standardised.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fabrics vary from each other in the sharpness of a crease which may be obtained in steam pressing operations performed on a garment made from the fabric. For example a high quality pure wool structured garment is pressed as one of the final processes in garment manufacturing. The aim of pressing is to give a smooth crisp appearance to the panels and seams of the garment. If during the pressing the seam can not be made flat and sharp, but tends to billow, then it is said to be "blown". Seam blowing can make a high quality wool garment unacceptable for sale and is occurring with increasing frequency in light-weight fabrics.The ability of a seam to press flat is not directly related to other fabric properties but can be modified during finishing. It is important therefore to be able to predict the performance in seam pressing of a fabric prior to cutting so that remedial measures can be taken where required.If a sample of fabric is conditioned, folded and pressed, and allowed to recover, the angle of the crease can be measured and used to predict whether seam blowing will occur. When this value is related to other fabric properties such as weight and formability, it can be used to predict the overall appearance of the pressed seam.In devising an appropriate test for predicting the crease setting performance of a fabric, it is necessary to bear in mind that fabric manufacturers will normally not have steam pressing apparatus available to them which is suitable as a test apparatus. Any apparatus that fabric manufacturers may have available, even if usable in a crease setting performance test, is liable to be subject to numerous unpredictable sources of error which would limit the value of the data obtained as a reliable predictor of a fabric's crease setting performance.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There is disclosed herein a method of setting a crease in a fabric for measurement of the fabric's crease setting performance comprising: conditioning a sample of the fabric to a predetermined water content level ; bending the sample of fabric upon itself to form a crease therein; 

 heating the sample of fabric and maintaining the crease therein, for. predetermined period, under conditions which ensure that the water content of the fabric remains substantially constant; and

CLAIMS
1. A method of setting a crease 1n a fabric for measurement of the fabric's crease setting performance comprising: conditioning a sample of the fabric to a predetermined water content level; bending the sample of fabric upon Itself to form a crease therein; heating the sample of fabric and maintaining the crease therein, for a predetermined period, under conditions which ensure that the water content of the fabric remains substantially constant; and rapidly cooling the sample to set the crease.
2. The method of claim 1, further Including providing an enclosure which is adapted to provide an airtight chamber, and wherein heating of the fabric takes place in said chamber.
3. The method of claim 2, wherein said chamber provides a narrow gap so that the sample located therein is placed under pressure.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein said enclosure includes a pair of cooperating plates between which said gap is defined, and said method further includes the steps of providing the first plate, mounting said sample on a press surface of said first plate, sealingly mounting the second plate on said first plate and pressing said plates together to apply pressure to said sample.
5. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein said sample is heated to the temperature of boiling water.
6. The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein conditioning of said sample is achieved by moving air of a predetermined humidity through the fabric.
7. The method of claim 2 or 3, further Including providing in said chamber to transmit pressure to said sample, a sheet of resilient material. 8. A fabric crease setting cell comprising: a base having a press surface; a cap having a press surface; seal means joining the base and cap and cooperating therewith to provide a sealed chamber to receive a folded fabric sample, so that a sample located therein is sealingly enclosed within the chamber; and clamp means maintaining said base and cap sealingly connected and placing said sample under pressure to crease the sample.

 9. The cell of claim 8, further including a resilient sheet said chamber, and a disc abutting said sheet, which disc engages sai sample.
10. The press cell of claim 8 or 9, wherein said seal means includes a resilient ring encompassing said chamber and sandwiched between said cap and base.
