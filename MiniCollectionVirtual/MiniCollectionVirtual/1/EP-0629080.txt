<ABSTRACT>
An adaptive method for suppressing video signal x(k) echoes 
in equalizers of TV sets including digital filters whose 

coefficients are updated in an adaptive and iterative manner 
using an LMS (Least Mean Square) algorithm until the 

difference, or output error, between a target output signal 
d(k), called the reference signal, and an outgoing signal 

y(k) from the equalizer is gradually reduced, comprises the 
steps of: applying a "combing" technique to an original 

filter having K*N coefficients in order to select K comb 
filters having N coefficients each; 


applying said LMS algorithm, with a variable convergence 
factor (µ) to each individual comb filter for a predetermined 

number of iterations; 
gathering the resultant configurations of the comb filter 
coefficients and selecting a subfilter with N largest modulo 

coefficients therefrom; 
updating the values of said N coefficients again by 
reiterating the LMS algorithm to said subfilter for a limited 

number of iterations; 
zeroing all the coefficients with a lower modulo than a 
predetermined threshold; 
selecting a group of F coefficients by a slotting operation 
across those of said coefficients which have a clust
er value: 
and 
 
updating the value of said group of F coefficients, by 
reiterating the LMS algorithm, until the output error e(k) 

becomes smaller than a predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an adaptive method of suppressing
video signal echoes in latest generation TV sets.More particularly, the invention relates to an adaptive
method of suppressing video signal echoes x(k) in equalizers
of TV sets incorporating digital filters whose coefficients
are updated in an adaptive and iterative manner using an LMS
(Least Mean Square) algorithm until the difference, or output
error, between a desired output signal d(k) -- called the
reference signal -- and an outgoing signal y(k) from the
equalizer is progressively reduced.As is well known, one of the main causes for deterioration of
the TV picture quality on the displays of today's analog TV
receivers is the appearance of duplicates of the original
signal which, by overlapping the primary image, create a so-called
echo effect.TV echoes, best known as ghost effects, are usually due to
reflections undergone by the primary TV signal against fixed
rebound surfaces, such as mountains, buildings, etc..Also, some moving objects, such as airplanes flying over the
area between the TV transmitter and the TV receiver, may
scatter the TV signal and generate such noise.The echoes thus generated are presented to the receiver in
the form of delayed, attenuated, and distorted duplicates of
the primary image. The video echo phenomenon actually is a
major deteriorating factor of TV pictures, and its influence
is most noticeable on the latest Improved Quality (IQTV)
receivers and the High Definition (HDTV) wide screen ones. In fact, with these new generation TV sets, the doubled line
scan frequency and the use of large size screens tend to
enhance the ghost effect on the display.Accordingly, while a standard TV receiver equipped with a
channel equalizer can provide a picture of
significantly improved quality, the use of an equalizer is
bound to become an absolute necessity in IQTV and HDTV sets.For a better understanding of the invention aspects, a review
of the traditional ghost-suppressing techniques will be
given first.The ghost cancelling operation is basically one of filtering
the TV signal being input to the TV receiver.The TV ghost cancelling process is usually based on a so-called
equalization system.Since the characteristics of an RF video channel vary over
time because they are strictly dependent on environment and
operating conditions, the ghost cancelling process is the
most effective when an automatic equalization system of the
adaptive type is used. Two different approaches are available
for implementing a video channel

Adaptive method for suppressing video signal (x(k)) echoes
in equalizers of TV sets including digital filters whose

coefficients are updated in an adaptive and iterative manner
using an LMS (Least Mean Square) algorithm such that the

difference, or output error signal, between a target output
signal (d(k)), called the reference signal, and an outgoing

signal (y(k)) from the equalizer is gradually reduced,
comprising the following steps:


receiving an input signal (x(k));
computing a difference between an output (y(k)) of an
equalizer including digital filters (2,5) having K*N

coefficients, and supplied with the input signal (x(k)), and
the reference output signal (d(k));
applying an LMS algorithm having a variable convergence
factor (µ) for a predetermined number (L) of iterations, to

reduce the error between said output (y(k)) and said
reference signal (d(k));
processing the digital filter coefficients in order to select K
subfilters having N coefficients each;
applying said LMS algorithm, with a variable convergence
factor (µ) to each individual subfilter for a predetermined

number of iterations; characterized by the further following
steps:
collecting the resultant configurations of the subfilter
coefficients;
carrying out a slotting operation, comprising selecting
groups of F coefficients, the coefficients of each group

being larger than a threshold value and being symmetrically
clustered about a peak coefficient value, the number of said 

groups being equal to the maximum number of echoes it is
desired to suppress;
clearing all the coefficients with a lower modulo value
than a predetermined threshold value;
reiterating the LMS algorithm, until the output error
signal (e(k)) becomes smaller than a predetermined value;
processing the input signal (x(k)) using the F coefficients
provided by the previous step.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that said
threshold value is selected based on the largest modulo

coefficient of the N coefficients selected.
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in that said
slotting operation consists of retaining the values of

the F coefficients selected,
wherein, in each selected group of F coefficients, F-1 coefficients

are substantially symmetrically disposed about the
coefficient of said group exhibiting the largest modulo value.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
step of selecting a group includes the step of slotting at

least three coefficients about said peak coefficient value.
