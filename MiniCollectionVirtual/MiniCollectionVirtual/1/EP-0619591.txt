<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a magnetothermal trip unit for one pole of a multipole circuit breaker. It comprises a magnetic yoke (100) having an E-shaped cross-section, the central branch (101) of which defines two compartments (102 and 103). It further includes a bimetallic strip (54) housed in one of the compartments, carrying an electric current between an input terminal and an output terminal of the said pole. It finally includes a movable blade (56) arranged to trigger the circuit breaker if the electric current exceeds a predetermined threshold. The bimetallic strip (54) is connected by a conducting flexible braid (104) to a conducting part (105a) which can be arranged in the other compartment or outside of the magnetic yoke. The two variants are produced with the same components, depending on the user requirements.

<CLAIMS>
A magnetothermal trip module for a pole of a multipole circuit breaker (10), 
equipped with an input terminal (40) and an output terminal (50), the module 

comprising a magnetic yoke (100) having an E-shaped transverse cross section 
defining two compartments arranged on each side of the central branch of the E, 

through which yoke (100) there passes a bimetal strip (54) through which a current 
flows between the input terminal (40) and the output terminal (50), and this yoke 

being associated to a movable blade (56) able to be attracted against the polar 
surfaces of the magnetic yoke (100) when the current flowing in the bimetal strip (54) 

exceeds a preset threshold, and to actuate in this case a trip bar (52) of the circuit 
breaker, characterized in that said bimetal strip (54) is placed in one of said 

compartments (102) and is connected by a flexible conducting braid (104) to a 
conducting part (105a, 105b) arranged either in the other adjacent compartment 

(103) or outside the yoke (100) depending on the magnetic tripping threshold 
required, that the blade (56) is urged to a position separated from the polar surfaces 

of the magnetic yoke by a retum spring (107), and that the adjustment means 
comprise a first adjustment screw (108) for adjusting the initial deflection of the 

bimetal strip (54), and a second adjustment screw (109) for adjusting the air-gap of 
the blade (56). 
The module according to claim 1, characterized in that the first adjustment screw 
(108) is engaged through a threaded bore arranged in the magnetic yoke (100) and 

that its end is pressing against the bimetal strip (54). 
The module according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the second adjustment 
screw (109) comprises a latching head (110) which passes through an opening 

arranged in the blade (56).
