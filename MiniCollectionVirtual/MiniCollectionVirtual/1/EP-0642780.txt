<ABSTRACT>
The delivery bed has a three-part reclining surface of a backrest part (17), a small of the back part (19), and a leg part (21). The latter is lowerable below the plane of the two remaining parts via a hoist (13). There is a swivel mechanism for moving the leg part into an inserted position under the small of the back part. The hoist consists of a telescoping hoist column, moving in a support column of the undercarriage frame. The entire reclining surface may be height-adjustable by another, lower hoist column (12).

Birthing bed having an undercarriage mounted on rolls 
and a substantially three-part lying face consisting of 

a back part, a pelvis part and a foot part, the foot 
part being lowerable by means of a lifting device beneath 

the plane of the other two lying face parts in a horizontal 
position and a tilting device is provided by means 

of which the foot part is retractable in a retracted position 
underneath the pelvis part,
 
characterised in that as a lifting device (13) a lifting 

post (13) is provided which is telescopically extensible 
by hydraulic or electromotive means from a supporting 

post (12a) of the undercarriage frame, the foot part 
(21) being mounted at this lifting post by means of frame 

supports,
 
that the whole lying face of the birthing bed is adjustable 

in height in a horizontal position by means of 
a further lower lifting post (12)
 
and that the respective lower ends of two supporting 

arms (14, 15) forming approximately a "U" are connected 
to the lower lifting post (12) and that a supporting post 

(12a) rests on the lower lifting post (12) which receives 
the upper lifting post (13) for the height adjustment 

of the foot part (21) in a telescopically extensible 
manner. 
Birthing bed as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the foot part (21) is adjustable in its inclination 

independently of the other lying face parts by means 
of a separate lifting device (25) by pivotment about 

a horizontal shaft (22). 
Birthing bed as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the back part (17) is adjustable  

 
by means of a separate lifting device (23) independently 

of the other lying face parts by pivotment about a horizontal 
shaft (18) in a position inclined upwardly as well 

as in a position inclined downwardly beneath the horizontal. 
Birthing bed as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the pelvis part (19) is adjustable 

in its inclination by means of a separate lifting 
device (24) by pivotment about a horizontal shaft (20). 
Birthing bed as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that for the retraction (pivoting) of 

the foot part (21) in its lowered position a swivel arm 
system (27, 32) is provided which is hinged at a stationary 

frame support of the lying face frame and is 
operable via a horizontal telescopic cylinder (26) engaging 

one of the swivel arms (27). 
Birthing bed as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the swivel arm system is designed 

such that the foot part (21) is subject to a linear shifting 
relative to the longitudinal axis of the bed over the 

whole shifting path during retraction. 
Birthing bed as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the retraction of the foot part (21) 

beneath the pelvis part (19) is prevented in the case 
of a foot part in inclined position by means of a stop 

mechanism. 
Birthing bed as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the swivel arm system comprises  

 
a first swivel arm (27) connected to a stationary frame 

support of the lying face frame so as to be pivotable 
about the vertical axis of a hinge joint (28) and further 

connected via a hinge joint (30) to an arm (29) fixedly 
connected to the underside of the foot part (21) in an 

articulated manner, as well as a second swivel arm (32) 
which at one of its ends is connected via a hinge 

joint (31) to the stationary arm (29) of the foot part 
(21) and at its other end is connected via a hinge joint 

(33) to a stationary support of the lying face frame, 
as well as a telescopic cylinder (26) which is, at one 

of its ends, articulatedly connected to a stationary support 
of the lying face frame and at its other telescopic 

end engages the first swivel arm (27).
