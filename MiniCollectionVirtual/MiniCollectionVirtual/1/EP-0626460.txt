<ABSTRACT>
The steel contains, in proportions by weight, from 20 to 30 % of chromium, 25 to 32 % of nickel, from 3 to 7 % of molybdenum, from 0.35 to 0.8 % of nitrogen, from 0.5 to 5.4 % of manganese, up to 0.06 % of carbon and up to 1 % of silicon. As a result of its great versatility in corrosion resistance, the steel can be employed in particular for the manufacture of equipment for decontamination of fumes, the paper pulp industry, for the chemical industry or for oil exploration, seawater plants and for the manufacture of tankers for transporting corrosive products. The steel has a very high structural stability.
