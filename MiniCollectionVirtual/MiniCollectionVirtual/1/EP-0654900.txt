<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radio transceiver having a radiofrequency output stage and a control loop for controlling the transmitted power, a signal which is derived from the transmitted signal being fed to the control loop as an actual value. In particular in the case of hand-held radio transceivers, the fact that the hand-held radio transceiver is held means that the surroundings of the antenna are necessarily changed continually, as a result of which antenna mismatches are continually produced. Interference can occur because of this in the case of power control circuit concepts which are customary in the prior art. In order to avoid such interference, the invention proposes feeding to the control loop as the actual value a signal which has been picked off upstream of the radiofrequency output stage, via a buffer amplifier (isolation amplifier) which is provided specifically for this purpose.

<CLAIMS>
A TDMA transceiver having a high-frequency power output stage (11)
and a control circuit (16, 17) for controlling the transmitter power, in which the control

circuit (16, 17) is supplied with an actual voltage in the form of a signal derived from
the transmit signal and the control circuit (16, 17) changes the input signal level of the

HF power output stage (11), characterized in that a sensor driver amplifier (15) is
provided which is supplied with the extracted input signal of the HF power output stage

and which is dimensioned such that its output signal contains a power that is
proportional to the output power of the HF power output stage and which is applied to

the control circuit (16, 17) as an actual voltage while at least the HF power output stage
(11) and the sensor driver amplifier (15) are together integrated with an integrated

circuit.
An integrated circuit for TDMA radio transceivers having a controllable
HF driver amplifier (10), a HF power output stage (11) and a sensor driver amplifier

(15) which is supplied with the extracted input signal of the HF power output stage (11)
and which is dimensioned such that its output signal has a power that is proportional to

the output power of the HF power output stage (11) and which can be applied to a
control circuit (16, 17) as an actual voltage for controlling the transmitter power.
A radio transceiver and integrated circuit respectively, as claimed in claim
1 or 2, characterized in that the integrated circuit is manufactured in Gallium Arsenide

technology.
