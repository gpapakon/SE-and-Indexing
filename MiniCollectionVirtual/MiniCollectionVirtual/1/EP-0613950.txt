<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixture of surface-active chemical compounds which are obtained by reacting yeasts or bacteria with natural, vegetable or animal fats and oils, the reaction being carried out in aqueous medium and in the presence of a catalytically active agent. These compounds can be used as essentially non-ionic surfactants with a slight anionic contribution, for example as foaming agents, cleaners, emulsifiers for a wide variety of organic substances in water and for water-in-oil emulsions, and as wetting agents in the widest sense.
