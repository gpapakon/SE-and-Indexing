<ABSTRACT>
Prodn. of granulated kieserite comprises granulating a (opt. pre-moistened) charge of kieserite (I), with the addn. of water, granulating assistant (A) and salts (B); drying the green pellets and sieving to obtain Saleable pellets. The pellets (II) which are unsuitable are returned and added with fresh (I) opt. after milling. The charge comprises particles with average size of 0.3-0.4 mm, dust-free milled particles with average size 0.02-0.04, and the returned (II). Granulation is carried out in a granulator or a granulating drum. (A) is a mono- or di-saccharide (0.2-0.7% based on the amt. of (I) without (II)). (B) is ammonium sulphate, chloride, dihydrogen phosphate or hydrogen phosphate (0.5-0.9%) and 0.25-0.45 (calculated on a water-free basis) disodium tetraborate. (A) and (B) are added as finely divided powder before moistening, or as an aq. soln. The green pellets are dried to a residual moisture content of 0.5-2.0%.

<CLAIMS>
A method of granulating kieserite by rolling a mixture which is 
pre-wetted or wetted in the operation of building up the pellets, 

comprising kieserite with a mean grain size of 0.3 to 0.4 mm, kieserite 
which is ground to dust-fine size with a mean grain size of 0.02 to 0.04 

mm and the return material obtained from defective grain of the 
granulation operation on the granulating plate or in the granulating 

drum with the addition of water and granulating additives such as 
saccharides and polysaccharides, and inorganic compounds from the group 

comprising ammonium salts and phosphates, drying of the green pellets to 
the required residual moisture content, sieving and discharging the 

saleable grain fraction as a product and returning the defective grain, 
possibly after crushing, as return material, characterised in that with 

respect to the amount of fresh material 0.2 to 0.7% of a mono- or 
disaccharide, 0.5 to 0.9% ammonium sulphate, chloride, dihydrogen 

phosphate or hydrogen phosphate and 0.25 to 0.45% disodiumtetraborate, 
calculated water-free, in a dissolved condition together with the 

granulating liquid or prior to the addition of the granulating liquid in 

finely divided form in a dry condition is added to the feed material 
into the rolling apparatus, and the shaped green pellets are dried to a 

residual moisture content of 0.5 to 2.0%. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
tetraborate is used in the form of its decahydrate borax in a metered 

amount of 0.5 to 0.8% with respect to the amount of fresh material, and 
the green pellets are dried to a residual moisture content of 0.7 to 

1.5%. 
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
disaccharide is used in the form of molasses with a 40 to 50% sugar 

content together with 0.2 to 0.5% starch, with respect to the fresh 
material.
