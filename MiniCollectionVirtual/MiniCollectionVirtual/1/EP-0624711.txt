<ABSTRACT>
A valve assembly comprising a tubular member (2) 
having an axial bore (4) which is selectively opened and 

closed by a gate valve. The gate valve includes a sliding 
gate (5), a first actuating stem (9,27) engagable with one 

side of the gate and a second actuating stem on the 
opposite side of the gate and also engagable with the gate. 

The actuating stems can move the gate between open and 
closed positions, and an intermediate position in which the 

gate can be run into and withdrawn from a support with the 
tubular member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a valve assembly
which can be used in a wellhead assembly.A valve assembly with the features of the preamble of claim 1 is in itself known from the GB-A-2 168 463.In a wellhead assembly, it is usual to fill the bore
of a tubing hanger with a wireline plug to isolate the
upper part of the bore from a production region. The use
of such plugs, of which there may be more than one in a
wellhead, increases the number of wireline operations as
each one has to be run in and set by a wireline. Further,
once the plug is set, it requires a further wireline
operation in order to remove it.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide means for sealing a bore which may be used in a
wellhead assembly without requiring extra wireline
operations.According to the present invention, there is provided
a valve assembly comprising a tubular member which seats,
in use, in a support and has an axial bore which is
selectively opened and closed by a gate valve, the valve
comprising a gate having an opening therethrough, a first
actuating stem engagable with one side of the gate and
reciprocable, in use, through the support, and a second
actuating stem, in use, engageable with the opposite side
of the gate and reciprocable through the support, wherein
the actuating stems can move the gate between open and
closed positions, and an intermediate position in which the
gate can be run into and withdrawn from the support with
the tubular member.The tubular member may be a tubing hanger or an
isolation cap. The support is preferably provided by a
spool body.The gate can be run into a wellhead with the tubing
hanger or isolation cap and makes the automatic control of
the opening and closing of the bore possible, for example
by hydraulic actuation. This therefore reduces the number
of wireline operations necessary. It is desirable that the gate be retainable in the
intermediate position so that the tubular member can be
withdrawn from the support without the gate interfering
with the support. The gate is preferably retained by means
of a detent which may comprise a spring loaded plunger in
one of the tubular member and gate, the end of the plunger
being engagable with a recess in the other of the tubular
member and gate.In order to ensure that the actuating stems do not
interfere with the tubular member when it is removed from
the support, it is preferable that actuating stems are
retractable from engagement with the gate when it is in the
intermediate position.So that the position of the

A valve assembly comprising a tubular member (2) which
seats, in use, in a support and has an axial bore (4) which

is selectively opened and closed by a gate valve, the valve
comprising a gate (5) having an opening (6) therethrough,

a first actuating stem (9,27) engagable with one side of
the gate and reciprocable, in use, through the support, characterised in that it further comprises

a second actuating stem (9,27) engageable with the opposite
side of the gate and reciprocable, in use, through the

support, wherein the actuating stems can move the gate
between open and closed positions, and an intermediate

position in which the gate can be run into and withdrawn
from the support with the tubular member.
A valve assembly according to claim 1, wherein the
gate (5) is retainable in the intermediate position so that

the tubular member (2) can be withdrawn from the support

without the gate interfering with the support.
A valve hanger assembly according to claim 2, wherein
the gate (5) is retained by means of a detent (22).
A valve assembly according to claim 3, wherein the
detent comprises a spring loaded plunger (24) in one of the

tubular member (2) and gate (5), the end of the plunger
being engagable with a recess (24') in the other of the

tubular member and gate.
A valve assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the actuating stems (9,27) project, in use,

from the support to provide a visual indication of the
position of the gate (5).
A valve assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the actuating stems (9,27) are retractable 

from engagement with the gate (5) when it is in the
intermediate position.
A valve assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the actuating stems (9,27) are

hydraulically actuated.
A valve assembly according to claim 7 when dependent
on claim 6, wherein each actuating stem (9,27) has an inner

part (16) adjacent to the gate (5), a central part (17) of
smaller diameter than the inner part, and an outer part

(18), remote from the gate, of larger diameter than the
inner part, and a piston (19) being sealed to and slidably

fitted on the central part such that it is retained on the
central part and abuts, in use, against the inner or outer

parts at respective ends (25,26) of the central part, the
piston being sealed to and slidably received in a cylinder,

which is fixed, in use, to the support, whereby the
application of pressure to the cylinder of one of the

actuating stems on the side of the piston remote from the
gate causes the gate to be moved to its open position, the

application of pressure to the cylinder of the other of the
actuating stems on the side of the piston remote from the

gate causes the gate to be moved to its closed position,
the application of pressure to both cylinders on the side

of the piston closest to the gate causes the gate be moved
to its intermediate position, and the application of equal

pressure to each side of both pistons causes the actuating
stems to be retracted from the gate when it is in the

intermediate position.
A valve assembly according to any one of claims 1 to
6, wherein a handwheel (29) is provided on each actuating

stem (27) at the end of the stem remote from the gate (5)
and each actuating stem is threadably engaged within a

housing (28), whereby each handwheel can be rotated to move
a respective stem axially. 
A valve assembly according to claim 9, wherein an end
cap (30), which provides a stop for the handwheel (29), is

fitted over the end of each housing (28), the cap being
selectively deployable in two axial positions relative to

the axis of the actuating stem.
A valve assembly according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein a seal ring (7) is provided on each side of

the gate which ring seals on one side against the gate (5)
and on the other side around the bore (4) of the tubular

member (2).
A valve assembly according to claim 11, wherein the
seals between the gate and seal rings, and between the

tubular member and seal rings are metal-to-metal seals.
