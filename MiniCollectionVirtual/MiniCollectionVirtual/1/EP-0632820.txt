<ABSTRACT>
High concentration collagen compositions having improved persistence when administered for soft tissue augmentation are prepared from both cross-linked and non-cross-linked collagen starting materials. Suspensions of the starting materials are subjected to vigorous mechanical disruption to reduce the average collagen fiber size to below a threshold level which enhances the injectability of the composition. Thus, both enhanced injectability and enhanced persistence may be achieved using the same formulations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
compositions, methods for treatment, and methods for
preparation of injectable collagen implant materials for
soft tissue augmentation. More particularly, the present
invention relates to high concentration collagen
compositions that have been homogenized to enhance
injectability.The use of both cross-linked and non-cross-linked
collagen compositions for soft tissue repair and
augmentation is known. The preparation and use of non-cross-linked
collagen compositions is described in U.S.
Patent No. 3,949,073.A commercial product
incorporating non-cross-linked collagen at a
concentration of 65 mg/ml is available from Collagen
Corporation, Palo Alto, California, under the tradename
Zyderm II. The preparation and use of cross-linked
collagen compositions is described in U.S. Patent No.
4,582,640.A commercial product incorporating
cross-linked collagen at a concentration of 35 mg/ml is
available from Collagen Corporation, Palo Alto,
California, under the tradename Zyplast.The use of both cross-linked and non-cross-linked
collagen compositions for soft tissue repair and
augmentation has been limited by a lack of "persistence,"
where persistence is defined as the tendency for the
implanted collagen to form a cohesive mass and resist
migration from an injection site. Previous injectable
collagen compositions have also suffered from syneresis
where the liquid component of the composition (typically
a gel) separates during or after injection, resulting in
a non-uniform consistency in the implant. One approach for improving persistence and
reducing syneresis might be to increase the collagen
concentration in the composition used for soft tissue
augmentation. Heretofore, the use of high concentration
collagen compositions has been shown to be ineffective
due to the difficulty in introducing the composition to
the treatment site. Most commonly, collagen compositions
are introduced as aqueous suspensions through a fine
gauge needle to the tissue site of interest. Injection
of high concentration collagen compositions is
problematic. The use has been further discouraged by a
perception that implants formed from high concentration
collagens will calcify and harden over time. Hardened
collagen implants are generally unacceptable for soft
tissue implantation. For these reasons, any benefits
which may derive from the use of high concentration
collagen compositions remain speculative.It would thus be desirable to provide improved
collagen compositions, improved methods for preparing
