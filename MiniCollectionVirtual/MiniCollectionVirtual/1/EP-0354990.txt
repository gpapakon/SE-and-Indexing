<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The invention is based on the object of improving a trunked radio network with a central radio control (ZS) and a plurality of mobile radio stations (M1,M2), in which the call is initiated by means of data messages, in such a manner that the time needed for setting up the connection is shortened. 2.2 The solution consists in that a first mobile radio station (M1), which has requested a connection from the central radio control (ZS), searches a control channel (OK) for the presence of a switch-over message (UT) intended for the called mobile radio station (M2). With a positive result of the search, the first mobile radio station sends an acknowledgement message (QT1) in the control channel (OK) to the central radio control and switches to the allocated voice channel (SK). At the same time, the called mobile radio station (M2) also switches to the allocated voice channel and subsequently sends an acknowledgement message (QT2) in the voice channel to the central radio control. 3. The drawing shows a block diagram of a trunked radio network according to the invention comprising a central radio control and three mobile radio stations.

Method for setting up a communication for a 
trunked radio network comprising a plurality of voice 

channels and a control channel, having a central radio 
control and a plurality of mobile radio stations, a 

mobile radio station transmitting its call request to the 
central radio control via the control channel by means of 

a call telegram which contains the identification of the 
mobile radio station in question and the call number of 

the desired mobile radio station, the said central radio 
control calling the desired mobile radio station by means 

of a switch-over telegram which contains, inter alia, the 
call number of the desired mobile radio station and the 

number of a free voice channel, and the called mobile 
radio station transmitting as confirmation of reception 

an acknowledgment telegram to the central radio control, 
characterized in that the mobile radio station (M1) which 

has transmitted a call telegram (RT) examines the control 
channel (OK) for the presence of the switch-over telegram 

(UT) intended for the called mobile radio station (M2) 
and when there is a positive result of the examination 

transmits an acknowledgment telegram (QT1) on the control 
channel (OK) to the central radio control (ZS) and 

subsequently switches over to the assigned voice channel 
(SK), while the called mobile radio station (M2) switches 

over immediately after reception of the switch-over 
telegram to the assigned voice channel and subsequently 

transmits an acknowledgment telegram (QT2) on the voice 
channel (SK) to the central radio control (ZS). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that in the case of an undersupplied trunked radio  

 
network the switch-over telegram (UT) is transmitted 

successively two or more times by the central radio 
control (ZS). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the switch-over telegram (UT) is repeatedly transmitted 

on the control channel (OK) and the assigned voice 
channel (SK) when no acknowledgment telegram (QT) of one 

of the mobile radio stations has been received. 
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the acknowledgment telegrams (QT) are 

staggered in terms of timing in such a way that the 
calling mobile radio station (M1) firstly transmits an 

acknowledgment on the control channel (OK) and the called 
mobile radio station (M2) transmits an acknowledgment on 

the voice channel assigned to it after a delay (t
v
) which 
corresponds approximately to the length of an acknowledgment 

telegram. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a calling mobile radio station (M1) which is 

already switched by a switch-over telegram (UT) from the 
control channel (OK) to the assigned voice channel (SK) 

is switched back to the control channel by a resetting 
telegram (RT) transmitted by the central radio control 

(ZS) on the voice channel when the subscriber of the 
called mobile radio station (M2) can no longer be 

reached. 
Method according to Claim 1, 2 or 5, characterized 
in that the data telegrams (RT, UT, QT1, QT2) have 

a first part (SYN) for the bit and block synchronization, 
a second part (BAK) for an operating-mode identification, 

a third part (STS) for a brief item of information, a 
fourth part (K) for a radio channel number, a fifth part 

(QA) for a source address and a sixth part (ZA) for a 
target address.
