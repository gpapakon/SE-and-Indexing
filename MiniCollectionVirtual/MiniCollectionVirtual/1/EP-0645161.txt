<ABSTRACT>
The invention specifies a tube connector of an elastomeric material for connection of a tube to thinner tubes, to be inserted in the tube connector, of different diameters and with removable coupling sections with gradually widening lumina, characterised in that the lumina of the coupling sections (2-8) are cylindrical and have at least one annular bead (25), or that the lumina of the coupling sections (32-38) are conical. The novel tube connector facilitates connection of tubes of different diameters and prevents unintentional release of the connection.

<CLAIMS>
A hose connector of rubber-elastic material for connecting a hose with
thinner hoses that are to be set into the hose connector and have different

diameters, comprising separable coupling sections with step-like flaring
cylindrical lumen,
characterized in

that
 the lumina of the coupling sections (2-8) have at least one annular
bead (25) or the lumina of the coupling sections (32-38) are of conical

configuration over the entire length of the section.
The hose connector of claim 1, 
characterized by
 a contiguous first set
of coupling sections with cylindrical lumen having at least one annular

bead (25), and a contiguous second set of coupling sections whose lumina
are conically shaped.
The hose connector of claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the lumina of the
conically shaped coupling sections are larger than the lumina of the

coupling sections with cylindrical lumen.
The hose connector of one of claims 1-3, 
characterized in that
 the annular
beads (25) are inclined in the direction of insertion of the hose.
