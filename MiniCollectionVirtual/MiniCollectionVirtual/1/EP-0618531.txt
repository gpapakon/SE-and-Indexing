<ABSTRACT>
In a read-only memory protected against erasual (program memory chip PSB) in processor-control devices (PG), loading is effected via a wireless data transmission interface (DUSF), the processor-control device (PG) being a mobile device in which a loading program intended for this purpose is installed which controls the communication of the data transmission interface (DUSF) and the erasure and the reprogramming of the read-only memory (PSB). The processor control program or program fragments to be reloaded are requested by the processor-control device (PG) block by block from a reloading station (NLS) having an also wireless data transmission interface (DUSN) and intended for this purpose, and stored. The individual program blocks are protected by checksums during the block-by-block transmission. After the programming has ended, the reloaded processor control program is checked for freedom from errors of the data transmission by length and checksum comparison.

Method for reloading processor control programs
which are loaded in a read only memory (PSB) which is

protected against erasure, for processor-controlled
appliances (PG), with the loading taking place via a

wire-free data transmission interface (DUSF) and the
processor-controlled appliance (PG) being a mobile

appliance in which a loading program is installed which
is intended for this purpose and controls the

communication of the data transmission interface (DUSF)
as well as the erasure and reprogramming of the read

only memory (PSB), characterized in that the processor
control program or program parts to be reloaded is or

are requested and saved by the processor-controlled
appliance (PG) in blocks from a reloading station

(NLS), which is provided for this purpose and has a
likewise wire-free data transmission interface (DUSN),

in that the individual program blocks are protected
during the block-by-block transmission (DÃœS) by means

of checksums, and in that once the programming process
has been completed, the reloaded processor control

program is checked for freedom from errors in the data
transmission by means of a length and checksum

comparison.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized in that the reloading station (NLS)
offers available programs or program versions for 

reloading by cyclic transmission of an information
block.
Method according to Claim 1,

characterized in that infrared light is used for
transmission.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims,

characterized in that said method is used in a known
traffic control and information system, with the

presence of a reloading control program being reported
to the vehicles via system transmission beacons.
Arrangement for reloading processor control
programs which are loaded in a read only memory (PSB)

which is protected against erasure,

having a reloading station (NLS) which has a data
transmission interface (DUSN),
having a processor-controlled mobile appliance
(PG) which has the read only memory (PSB) as well as a

further data transmission interface (DUSF) and an
installed loading program, with the loading program

controlling the wire-free communication of the further
data transmission interface (DUSF) with the data

transmission interface (DUSN) of the reloading station
(NLS) as well as the erasure and reprogramming of the

read only memory (PSB),

characterized

in that the reloading station (NLS) is in the form of a
fixed station having a computer (PC) and having a

display device (ANZ),

in that the processor-controlled appliance (PG)
comprises a vehicle computer (BR) which is arranged in

a vehicle (FZ) and is designed such that it requests
and saves the processor control program or program

parts in blocks from the reloading station, with the
individual program blocks being protected during the

block-by-block transmission by means of checksums, and
in that once the programming process has been

completed, the reloaded processor control program is
checked for freedom from errors in the data 

transmission by means of a length and checksum
comparison.
Arrangement according to Claim 5,

characterized in that the reloading station (NLS) has
at least one single-lane passageway (DF).
Arrangement according to Claim 5,

characterized in that the reloading station (NLS) is a
petrol station (T).
Arrangement according to one of claims 5 to 7,

characterized in that the data transmission interface
(DUSF) of the vehicle (FZ) is formed by the infrared

transmission interface which is already there, and the
data transmission interface (DUSN) of the reloading

station (NLS) is formed from the infrared transmission
interface, which is known from the infrared beacons, of

the known traffic control and information system.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 5 to 8,

characterized in that a display device (ANZ) on the
reloading station (NLS) indicates the reloading

process, or in that the reloading process can be
displayed in the vehicle (FZ) itself.
Arrangement according to Claim 5 or 8,

characterized in that the infrared beacons of the
traffic control and information system are provided

instead of the separate reloading station, with the
processor control program to be loaded being

transmitted to the vehicle piece-by-piece, that is to
say from beacon to beacon.
