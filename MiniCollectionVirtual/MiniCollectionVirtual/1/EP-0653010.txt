<ABSTRACT>
A central locking system for motor vehicles has all the opening and closing functions occurring in normal operation on the failure of individual components. A vehicle fitted therewith can be opened and locked even without operational door closing motors (50). The outside door handles (13) can be pulled without resistance or effect with the vehicle locked. To this end, a control cam (47) lifts an actuating arm (32) so that a door handle lever (35) can be operated without effect on the actuating arm (32).

Locking device for doors and, if appropriate, 
flaps or a bonnet or lid of a motor vehicle, having locks 

(10) assigned at least to the doors, outer and inner door 
handles (13, 14) assigned to said locks and at least one 

lock cylinder (12) which can be actuated from outside, 
the locks (10) in each case having a locking element 

(20), in particular a rotary latch, which interacts with 
a retaining element (16) in the door frame, can be locked 

in its closed position by means of a blocking element 
(23) and can be unlocked by actuating an unlocking lever 

(27, 28), the movability of which can be influenced by 
the position of a control member (44, 44') which can be 

adjusted by means of a motor (50), characterized in that 
each lock (10) has two unlocking levers (27, 28) which 

can be pivoted independently of each other and are in 
each case assigned to a door-handle lever (35) connected 

to one of the door handles (13, 14), and in that the 
door-handle levers (35) act, when actuated independently 

of one another but depending on the position of the 
control member (44), either on the assigned unlocking 

lever (27, 28) or, leaving the latter unaffected, can be 
pulled without any effect. 
Locking device for doors and, if appropriate, 
flaps or a bonnet or lid of a motor vehicle, having locks 

(10) assigned at least to the doors, outer and inner door 
handles (13, 14) assigned to said locks and at least one 

lock cylinder (12) which can be actuated from outside, 
the locks (10) in each case having a locking element 

(20), in particular a rotary latch, which interacts with  
 

a retaining element (16) in the door frame, can be locked 
in its closed position by means of a blocking element 

(23) and can be unlocked by actuating an unlocking lever 
(27, 28), the movability of which can be influenced by 

the position of a control member (44, 44') which can be 
adjusted by means of a motor (50), characterized in that 

each lock (10) has two unlocking levers (27, 28) which 
can be pivoted independently of each other and have 

drivers (34), which unlocking levers are assigned in each 
case to a door handle (13, 14), and in that the control 

member (44) has control cams (47, 48) which are arranged 
offset oppos
ite one another in such a manner that as the 
control member (44, 44') continues to rotate, at the same 

time at most one of the drivers (34) of the two unlocking 
levers (27, 28) is actuated. 
Locking device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the drivers (34), preferably mounted on 

bendable actuating arms (32, 33), are in each case 
connected movably, in a spring-loaded manner, to the 

unlocking levers (27, 28) and in that they can be grasped 
by door-handle levers (35) connected to the door handles 

(13, 14). 
Locking device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the drivers (34) can be 

brought independently of one another into two different 
positions by means of control cams (47, 48) of the 

control member (44), it being possible for the drivers 
(34) to be grasped in one position by the door-handle 

levers (35) and not in the other position. 
Locking device according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the drivers (34) and actuating arms (32, 

33) can each be raised by one of the control cams (47, 
48) and, with the control cam (47, 48) rotated away, can 

be lowered again by spring force. 
Locking device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the door-handle levers (35) 

each have entraining lugs (36) which, when the lock (10) 
is locked and a door handle (13, 14) is actuated, pass 

unaffected over the associated driver (34).  
 
Locking device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the unlocking levers (27, 

28) and the door-handle levers (35) of a lock (10) can be 
rotated around a common axis (22). 
Locking device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the motor (50) and control 

member (44) are arranged on a control-member carrier (45) 
which is fixed on a spindle (51) and is also held by an 

emergency release lever (53) which can be rotated away. 
Locking device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that when the emergency release 

lever (53) is rotated away, the control-member carrier 
(45) is rotated away downwards with the result that the 

driver (34) follows it into its position which can be 
reached by the door-handle lever (35). 
Locking device according to one of Claims 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the emergency release lever (53) is 

designed as an eccentric and can be actuated from outside 
by a key. 
Locking device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that there is mounted on the 

inside of the doors, for the purpose of emergency locking, 
a manually operable emergency locking lever (37) 

which engages, for outside locking, on the driver (34) or 
the actuating arm (32) and transfers said driver or 

actuating arm into its position which cannot be reached 
by the door-handle lever (35).
