<ABSTRACT>
An electrode assembly (12) for an electrosurgical instrument 
has an elongate tubular shaft (12S) with electrodes (12E) 

mounted on a distal end and, on a proximal end of the shaft, 
means (12M) for detachably mounting the assembly in a 

handpiece (10) of the instrument. Electrical conductors 
(20) pass through the shaft (12S) from the electrodes (12E) 

to contacts on the mounting means (12M) which are located so 
as to make a connection with a radio frequency source. The 

mounting means (12M) takes the form of a housing (12H) 
shaped for attachment to the handpiece (10) in a non-rotational 

relationship and, rotatably located within the 
housing, a sleeve (12SL) which is fixed to the shaft (12S). 

The conductors (20) terminate in contact portions (20C) 
secured in the housing (12H) of the mounting means (12M) and 

are so formed as to allow the electrodes (12E), the shaft 
(12S), parts of the conductors (20) in the distal end 

portions, the shaft (12S), and the sleeve (12SL) to rotate 
with respect to the housing (12H) and the contact portions 

(20C) about the axis of the shaft (12S).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrosurgical instrument,
particularly a laparoscopic instrument, and also to an
electrode assembly for such an instrument.
It is known to construct an electrosurgical instrument in
the form of a handpiece, a tubular shaft mounted in the
handpiece and, at a distal end of the shaft, at least one
fixed or movable electrode supplied with a radio frequency
electrical potential via a conductor passing through the
shaft and the handpiece. In an instrument for laparoscopic
use in particular, it is advantageous to be able to rotate
the electrode or electrodes about the axis of the shaft with
respect to the handpiece. In addition, it is conventional
to be able to remove and replace electrodes so that new
electrodes are used for each surgical procedure. Generally,
the remainder of the instrument is sterilisable and can be
used for a number (typically 10) of operations before
disposal. A known electrosurgical instrument of this type
is described in US-A-4 936 842.According to this invention, an improved electrode assembly
for an electrosurgical instrument comprises an elongate
tubular shaft mounting on a distal end portion thereof at
least one electrode, an electrical conductor passing through
the shaft and connected to the electrode, and, mounted on a
proximal end portion of the shaft, mounting means for
detachably mounting the assembly in a handpiece of the
instrument, the mounting means comprising a first component
shaped for attachment to the handpiece in a non-rotational
relationship, and a second component secured to the shaft
and rotatable with the shaft with respect to the first
component about a longitudinal axis of the shaft, the
conductor terminating in a contact portion housed in the
first component and being so formed as to allow the
electrode, the shaft, a part of the conductor in the distal
end portion of the shaft, and the second component to rotate 
with respect to the first component and the contact portion
about the longitudinal axis. This allows the assembly to be
detachably mounted in the handpiece whilst permitting
rotation of the shaft and electrode with respect to the
handpiece. Preferably, the or each contact portion is fixed
with respect to the first component whereby rotation of the
shaft and electrode can be achieved without simultaneous
sliding rotational contact between the contact portion and
a supply conductor in the handpiece, giving improved
reliability. Such an arrangement permits separate
sterilisation of the handpiece which can, as a result, be
use

<CLAIMS>
An electrode assembly (12) for an electrosurgical
instrument, the assembly comprising an elongate tubular

shaft (12S) mounting on a distal end portion thereof at
