<DESCRIPTION>
 PRODUCTION OF ARYL ETHANOLSThe present invention relates to an improved process for the production of aryl ethanols.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAryl ethanols are important intermediates in the manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. For example, 4-Hydroxyphenethyl alcohol (4-HPE) is useful as an intermediate in the preparation of several pharmaceutical compounds. U. S. Patent No. 4,760,182 describes the use of 4-HPE to prepare phenoxypropanolamines, in particular the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, betaxolol. EP patent application No. 249,245 describes the use of 4-HPE for preparing the anti-hypertensiveagents, phenyl (dialkyl)dihydropyridine dicarboxylates. JP 86-201940 describes its use - in preparing (aminopropoxyphenyl)alkanols and esters which are employed in the treatment of glaucoma.Synthesis of 4-HPE has been documented in the past. Ya ada et air Chem. Pharm. Bill., (Tokyo), Vol. 11, pp. 258-260 (1963) describe its preparation from the corresponding amine, which, however, is. not readily accessible. Khafaσy et al, J. Med. Chem.. Vol. 9(6), page 936 (1966) describe its synthesis from 4- hydroxyphenylacetic acid. Hussein, Anσew. Botan.. Vol. 38(1),pp. 1-43 (1964) reports its synthesis from phenethyl alcohol. 

 U. S. Patent No. 5,003,115 (assigned to Hoechst Celanese Corporation) describes the production of 4-HPE from 4-acetoxystyrene.There is a continuing interest in identifying improved and cost effective methods to prepare aryl ethanols such as 4-HPE, preferably from readily available materials or from materials that may be produced by- simple and economical processes.It has now been found that aryl ethanols can be prepared in high yields and in high purity from aryl methyl ketones, many of which are commercially available. The inventive process involves the oxidative conversion of aryl methyl ketones to ketoacetal derivatives, which can be hydrolyzed to glyoxals, which can then be reduced to aryl ethanols.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention includes a method for producing aryl ethanols from aryl methyl ketones which comprises" (a) oxidizing the aryl methyl ketone using an alkyl nitrite in a mixture of* an acid and a primary or secondary alcohol to a dialkylacetal derivative;(b) hydrolyzing the above dialkylacetal derivative to the corresponding glyoxal; and 

 (c) reducing both carbonyl functionalities of the glyoxal simultaneously to the aryl ethanol.The present invention further provides a process wherein an arylglyoxal is directly converted to an aryl ethanol by
