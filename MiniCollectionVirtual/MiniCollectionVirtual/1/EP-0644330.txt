<ABSTRACT>
A cold start control apparatus for diesel engines (26) 
includes a cold start switch (12), engine temperature and speed 

sensors (28, 24) and a transistor (16) all connected to a 
programmable controller (14). The transistor (16) is connected in 

a series circuit with a cold start relay (22) and the series 
circuit is connected to the run/crank positions of an ignition 

switch (10). The relay (22) has a pair of contacts through which 
a battery voltage (+12B) may be applied to a cold start assist 

apparatus provided for the engine. The cold start assist 
apparatus may be a thermostart element (30) such as a glow plug 

ignitor, or a solenoid controlled ether injection system (32). A 
permanent memory in the controller (14) stores an indication of 

the type of cold start assist apparatus provided for the engine. 
The controller (14) senses for actuation of the cold start switch 

(12) and applies a signal to the transistor (16) thus turning it 
on if (1) the ignition key is in the run or crank position, (2) 

the engine is cold and (3) the cold start assist apparatus is a 
thermostart element (30). On the other hand if the cold start 

assist apparatus is an ether injection system (32), the 
controller (14) responds to actuation of the cold start switch 

(12) to apply a signal to the transistor (16) only if (1) the 
engine is cold, (2) the ignition switch is in the crank position 

and (3) the engine speed is at least as great as a predetermined 
speed. While the transistor (16) is on, voltage is applied to the 

cold start assist apparatus. The controller (14) generates one 
signal to turn the transistor (16) on for each sensed actuation 

of the cold start switch (12). The duration of the signal is 
determined by the stored indication of the type of cold start 

assist apparatus provided for the engine (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a controller for 
controlling the application of a cold start aid to a diesel 
engine as shown in FR-A-2 339 750. More particularly, the invention provides a 
microprocessor-based controller which may be used to control 
either thermostarts or ether injection as aids in cold starting 
diesel engines. It is conventional in the prior art to provide some form of 
starting assist to aid in the starting of diesel engines when the 
engines are cold. Two widely used starting assists are ether 
injection and glow plug ignitors which ignite a small quantity of 
diesel fuel in the engine manifold, the ignitors being generally 
referred to as thermostarts. Ether injection is preferred by some 
because it provides a faster cold start. On the other hand, 
others prefer thermostart because of low cost and the advantage 
of not having to replenish the starting aid. Each type of starting assist has its own set of 
characteristics hence it has been conventional to provide 
separate hardware components and cabling specific to the starting 
assist on a particular engine. This increases manufacturing costs 
and complicates factory inventory and design. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a reconfigurable starting assist controller for starting 
cold diesel engines, the controller being equally suitable for 
controlling either ether injection or thermostarts. According to the invention a reconfigurable diesel engine 
cold start control apparatus is provided which is characterized 
in that the apparatus comprises : 
a programmable controller having stored therein 
configuration data defining first and second types of cold start 
assist apparatus; and a cold start assist apparatus for the engine, said cold  
 
start assist apparatus being one of said first and second types.  The invention aims to provide a starting assist controller 
as described above which is inexpensive and requires few parts in 
addition to those already present on a conventional diesel 
powered tractor. The cold start assist apparatus further comprises an 
ignition switch and a cold start switch; the controller being 
responsive to actuation of the cold start switch for generating 
a signal having a first duration when the configuration data 
defines the first type of cold start assist apparatus and a 
second duration when the configuration data defines the second 
type of cold start assist apparatus. Means are provided which are 
responsive to the signal and the ignition switch for energizing
