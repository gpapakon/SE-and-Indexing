<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stop for machine tools, in particular a right-hand stop for sizing circular saws having a pivotable saw blade. The stop has a stop rail (4) which is arranged parallel to a tool plane (6) and can be detachably fastened to a rest (8), movable and lockable on the machine frame (2) transversely to the tool plane (6), in one of two positions swivelled relative to one another by 90@ about the longitudinal rail axis. In a first position, the stop rail (4) turns a stop strip (18) of smaller height towards the tool. In a second position, the stop rail (4) turns a stop strip (20) of in contrast larger height towards the tool. A stop attached to the machine frame (2) interacts with a counter-stop on the rest (8) in order to limit the approach of the rest (8) to the tool. In particular, two stops (28, 30) are arranged on the machine frame (2) at different distances from the tool and interact with a counter-stop on the rest (8) set in each case to one of the stops as a function of the position of the stop rail (4).

A work seat for machine tools, especially a righthand stop 
for sizing saws with swivelling saw blade, which has a stop rail 

(4) arranged parallel to a tool plane (6), which rail can be 
detachably fixed to a support (8), capable of being moved and 

clamped on the machine frame (2) transversely to the tool plane 
(6), in one of two positions swivelled at 90Â° to one another 

about the rail longitudinal axis,
 
the stop rail (4) in a first position turning a stop bar (18) of 

lower height and in a second position a stop bar (20) of greater 
height towards the tool, and a first stop (28) on the machine 

frame (2) interacting with an opposing stop (34) on the support 
(8) in order to limit the approach of the support (8) to the 

tool,
 
characterised in that
 
on the machine frame (2) a second stop (30) is arranged at 

another distance from the tool and that the two stops (28, 30) 
interact with the opposing stop (34) an the support (8), adjusted 

to either of the stops respectively as a function of the position 
of the stop rail (4). 
A work seat as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterised in that the opposing stop comprises a part movably 

mounted on the support (8), which part in the first position of 
the stop rail (4) assumes a first position in which it is set to 

interact with the stop (28) further removed from the tool, whilst 
in the second position of the stop rail (4) it assumes a second 

position in which it interacts with the other stop (30), which 
is at a smaller distance from the tool. 
A work seat as claimed in claim 1, in which the stop rail (4) 
on two of its lateral faces has T-shaped slots (12) for fixing 

the stop rail (4) to the support (8),
 
the opposing stop being an elongated bolt (34), which is 

eccentrically mounted an the support (8) so that it is free to 
rotate about a horizontal axis, and which in the second position  

 
of the stop rail partially immerses in one of the T-shaped slots 

(12) under the force of gravity in such a way that it can move 
past the more distant stop (28) to the stop (30), laterally 

staggered in relation thereto, whilst the bolt (34) in the first 
position of the stop rail (4) is swivelled from this into its 

first position in which it interacts with the more distant stop 
(28). 
A work seat as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterised by an electro-mechanical sensor, which supplies 

different signals as a function of the position of the stop rail 
(4), which are used in order to traverse the opposing stop by 

means of an electric motor, so that one of the stops is 
activated. 
A work seat according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, with an electronic measuring and display unit, which 

determines the position of the support (8) in relation to the 
machine frame (2) and displays the value for the distance of the 

stop bar (18, 20) from the tool,
 
an electro-mechanical sensor supplying different signals 

according to the respective position of the stop rail (4) and 
delivering these to the measuring and display unit, which 

displays the actual distance of the stop bar (18, 20) from the 
tool, taking into account a variation of the distance of the stop 

bar (18, 20) from the support (8) when the position of the stop 
rail varies. 
A work seat as claimed in at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the stops (28, 30) are adjustable.
