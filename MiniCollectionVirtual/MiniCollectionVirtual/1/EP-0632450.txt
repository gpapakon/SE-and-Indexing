<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette comprises a supply and a 
take-up reel on which tape is wound, a cassette casing 

for rotatably enclosing the reels therein, a plurality 
of tape guide pins, each being press-fitted through the 

inner wall of the casing, for defining a tape path for 
the tape travelling between the pair of reels. The 

press-fit section of each guide pin is formed in a 
predetermined taper in such a manner as to gradually 

decrease its outer diameter towards its end. The 
straight press-fit section of the guide pin is formed in 

such a manner as to include a predetermined geometry of 
chamfered circumference at its end. In a tape guide pin 

used in conjunction with a tape guide roller, grease 
having a predetermined viscosity coefficient is disposed 

between the associated pin and roller. An electrical 
insulating cover is provided for surrounding the exposed 

underside of the electrically conductive lower half of 
the casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette
which is optimally adapted for use in recording and/or
reproducing apparatus.Recently, there have been proposed and developed
various magnetic tape cassettes to serve as an external
data storage medium.One such magnetic tape cassette has been
disclosed in US-A-4 198 013. This conventional tape
cassette includes a pair of reels, namely a supply reel
and a take-up reel, rotatably supported in the cassette
casing. As is generally known, magnetic tape is wound on
the pair of reels through a plurality of tape guide pins
by which the travelling path of the tape is controlled in
such a manner that the tape is wound on the reels at a
predetermined contact angle. That is, the tape travelling
path is defined by the upstanding guide pins, each
arranged at a predetermined location on the cassette
casing.The tape is driven by an endless belt 12 which
bears against the two rolls of tape. The tape is
maintained at the correct tension by applying drag to the
drive belt. This is achieved by using a springy cup
washer bearing against the roller and its support housing.Other ways of tensioning the belt are disclosed
in US-A-4 242 709, US-A-4 162 774 and US-A-4 688 742 which
provide a resilient member in or around the belt guide
roller to increase rolling friction and thus provide a
drag on the belt.As shown in Figure 1, a conventional guide pin
90 is integrally formed with a tape contact section 90a,
upper and lower flange sections 90b, and a press-fit 
section 90c extending from the bottom surface of the lower
flange section. Each section 90a, 90b or 90c has a
specific, constant, outer diameter. As seen in Figure 1,
the guide pin 90 is fixed on the cassette casing such that
the press-fit section 90c is press-fitted onto the
aluminium alloy lower half of the casing. Such guide pins
are traditionally formed by lathe machining. The
machining accuracy may be affected by various machining 
conditions, such as deflection of the workpiece,
fluctuation in bite by a cutting tool, and fluctuation
in lubrication by a cutting lubricant. For example, as
shown in Fig. 2, the press-fit section 90c is often
formed in a reverse taper fashion in which the outer
diameter is gradually increased from its root connected
to the bottom surface of the lower flange section 90b to
its end. Therefore, the outer diameter a at the root is
slightly smaller than that b at the end. If such a
reverse tapered press-fit section of the guide pin is
press-fitted into the lower half of the casing, the
greatest

<CLAIMS>
A tape cassette comprising:

a pair of reels (5,6) mounted side by side, on
which tape (7) is wound;
a cassette casing (1) for rotatably enclosing
said pair of reels (5,6) therein;
a driven roller (15) for rotation by a drive
device of a recording and/or reproducing apparatus

associated with said tape cassette, said driven roller
(15) being rotatably supported by an upstanding roller

shaft (18) fixed on the wall of said casing (1);
a pair of idle rollers (16,17), each rotatably
supported by an upstanding roller shaft (18) fixed on the

wall of said casing (1);
an endless flexible drive belt (25) for
drivingly engaging said driven roller (15) and said idle

rollers (16,17) to rotate said reels (5,6), such that a
portion of said drive belt (25) between said driven roller

(15) and each idle roller (16,17) pressingly contacts a
portion of the outermost peripheral surface of the tape

(7) wound on each reel (5,6), said drive belt (25) being
driven according to rotation of said driven roller (15); and
means for controlling tape tension of the tape
during operation of said tape cassette;

   characterised in that :

said means for controlling
tape tension includes grease (24) disposed between said associated

rollers (15-17) and shafts (18) for lubricating the
