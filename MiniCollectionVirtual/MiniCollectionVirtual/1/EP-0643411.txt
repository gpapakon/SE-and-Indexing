<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises an electromagnet (4) 
with a winding (6) and a movable core (22) with 

which is associated a return spring (28) which 
tends to retain the core in a rest position. This 

core (22) can be moved, by the excitation of the 
winding (6), towards an operative position in 

which it closes a switch (55; 54, 65a, 66a) which 
controls the supply of current to the starter 

motor. On the opposite side to the switch (55), 
the core (22) is associated with a control member 

(38), one end of which can be coupled to a lever 
transmission member (L) in order to couple a 

pinion (120) to a ring gear (122) of the internal 
combustion engine. This control member (38) is 

slidably coupled to the movable core (22) with 
predetermined relative axial clearance (P) between 

the two such that, when the movable core (22) 
moves from the rest position into the operative 

position and vice versa, the core (22) can perform 
an initial stroke of predetermined length before 

engaging and entraining the control member (38).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electromagnetic control
device for an electric starter motor for internal
combustion engines of the kind defined in the preamble of
claim 1.Such electromagnetic control devices are widely used in
vehicles for starting internal combustion engines.FR-A-2 571 783 discloses a device of this kind, in which
the movable core and the associated control member are
coupled with each other by means of a pair of springs
interposed therebetween. The said control member is
connected to one end of a transmission lever having a
central aperture surrounding with a predetermined play a
fixed fulcrum. The other end of said lever is connected to
a freewheel-pinion assembly displaceable along the shaft of
the starter motor. The arrangement is such that when the
control solenoid is energised, the movable core moves from
its rest position together with the said control member for
an initial stroke in which the said lever rotates about its
lower end, until said lever positively engages the
associated fulcrum pin. When the starter pinion does not
immediately mesh with the engine flywheel, the said control
member no longer follows the movement of the movable core,
and loads the springs interposed therebetween. These
springs cause a further rotation of the transmission lever
and the meshing of the starter pinion with the engine
flywheel as soon as the starter motor in energised. The object of the invention is to produce
an improved electromagnetic device of the previously defined kind.According to the invention, this object
is achieved by an electromagnetic device having
the features defined in Claim 1.In this way, the relative axial clearance
between the control member and the lever
transmission member is obtained inside the movable
core and no longer externally thereof.
Consequently, the axial size of the control means,
and hence the overall axial size of the
electromagnetic device, can be reduced.The invention will now be described with
reference to the appended drawings which
illustrate some preferred embodiments thereof,
presented solely by way of non-limiting example.
In the drawings: 
Figure 1 shows schematically a partial sectional
view of a starter motor;Figures 2, 3 and 4 are longitudinal sections of
an electromagnetic device according to the
invention, illustrated in different operating
steps;Figures 5 and 6 are longitudinal sections of an
electromagnetic device according to two variants
of embodiment.In Figure 1, a starter motor

(22) to which are associated return means (28)
tending to maintain the movable core in an axial

rest position, and which is movable by the
excitation of this winding (6) towards an axial
