<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an
optically active β-hydroxyketone of formula (I) shown below
by an asymmetrical aldol reaction in the presence of a
catalyst. The optically active β-hydroxyketone is useful,
for example, as an intermediate for biologically active
substances in the medical and pharmaceutical fields since it
has a plurality of functional groups.Known processes for preparing an optically active β-hydroxyketone
(an optically active alcohol) through a
catalytic asymmetrical aldol reaction include (1) reaction
between an aldehyde and a silyl-enol ether in the presence of
a binaphthol-oxotitanium complex (see T. Mukaiyama, et al.,
Chem. Letter., pp. 1015-1018 (1990)), (2) reaction between an
aldehyde and a silyl-enol ether in the presence of a boron
complex derived from tartaric acid (see K. Furuta, et al.,
Syn. Lett., pp. 439-440 (1991)), (3) reaction between an
aldehyde and a silyl-enol ether in the presence of a boron
complex derived from menthone (see E.R. Parmee, et al.,
Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 33, pp. 1729-1732 (1992)), and (4)
reaction between an aldehyde and nitromethane in the presence
of a binaphthol lanthanoid complex (see H. Sakai et al., J.
Am. Chem. Soc., Vol. 114, pp. 4418-4420 (1992)). However, 
these conventional processes were unsatisfactory in terms of
catalytic activity and optical purity (diastereo-selectivity
or enantio-selectivity). Besides, preparation of the above-mentioned
complex catalysts involves complicated operation.It is also known a process for preparing methyl 3-hydroxy-2,2,5-trimethylhexanoate
by reacting 1-Methoxy-2-methyl-1-trimethylsilyloxy-1-propene
with 3-methylbutanol in the
presence of (S)-binaphthol-dichlorotitanium complex (see
chemistry and Industry, vol. 23, 1986, page 824).As a result of extensive investigations, the present
inventors have found that an optically active β-hydroxyketone
can be obtained efficiently with high
diastereo-selectivity and high enantio-selectivity by using
an optically active binaphthol-titanium complex.The present invention relates to a process for
producing an optically active β-hydroxyketone represented by
formula (I):

wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, each
represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group; R3
represents a lower alkyl group, a phenyl group, a phenyloxy
group or a lower alkylthio group; and R5 represents a lower
alkyl group, a lower alkyloxymethyl group, a benzyloxymethyl
group or a lower alkyloxycarbonyl group, 
comprising reacting a silyl-enol ether represented
