<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of forming 
air layer over immersed surfaces of a structure having 
immersed portions and to a structure of a coating layer over 
the immersed surfaces intended to reduce the fluid friction 
resistance or drag of ships and the like. Structures having underwater surfaces or surfaces in 
contact with water, such as ships and liquid transport 
channels, produce a flow of water along their surfaces as the 
ships travel or liquid moves, with the velocity of water 
being zero at the submerged surface of the structure. A 
velocity gradient near the structure's submerged surface 
depends on the viscosity of fluid and the shearing forces due 
to viscosity constitute the fluid frictional drag. This fluid frictional drag experienced by the ship 
can be very large. Of the drags exerted on the ship as it 
navigates, which include a wave-making drag, a form drag and 
an air drag in addition to the fluid frictional drag, the 
fluid frictional drag accounts for as much as 60 to 70% of 
the total drag or resistance. Considering such a large proportion of the fluid  
 
frictional drag, the best way to economize the propelling power and increase the speed of 
a ship is to minimize the fluid frictional resistance and the development of such a 
technology has been strongly called for in the industry. Among the measures currently employed to reduce the fluid frictional drag on the 
ship are: a method which provides the bottom of the ship with projections to form 
flame-like air chambers and supplies air to the air chambers to form a layer of air over 
the surface of the ship's bottom; and what is generally called a micro-bubble method 
which blows out air over the surface of the hull to produce a large number of air bubbles 
over the surface. With the former method, however, there is a problem that when a ship moves, 
the air contained in the air chamber flows out and replenishing the lost air requires a 
large power. US-A-5,054,412 and GB-A-1,300,132 disclose such a method. In US-A-5,054,412, 
the air chambers are V-shaped grooves having a width of 0.25 to 1mm and a 
depth of 0.5 to 2mm, which extend in the direction of flow of the liquid. In GB-A-1,300,132, 
the air chambers are V-shaped having a depth of 0.1 to 1mm which 
transverse the direction of flow of the liquid. The latter method requires a large-scale compressor because friction resistance 
can only be reduced when a large quantity of air is supplied from nozzles provided at the 
side and bottom of the hull. This
