<CLAIMS>
Process for the continuous production of fibre-reinforced
thermoplastics, characterized in that

reinforcing fibres having a length of from 13 to
100 mm, and also conventional additives if desired, are

metered into the fluid plastics in a continuous mixing
apparatus composed of a multi-chamber kneader with more

than one chamber arranged in series, and the mixture is
homogenized under gentle conditions in a manner such

that at least 50% by weight of the reinforcing fibres
used retain at least 90% of their original fibre

length, and the mixture is then continuously discharged
from the mixing apparatus.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the fibre length of the reinforcing fibres used is

from 26 to 100 mm.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the fibre length of the reinforcing fibres used is

from 26 to 52 mm.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the plastics used are polyolefins
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the reinforcing fibres used are

glass fibres.
Fibre-reinforced thermoplastics which comprise
uniformly distributed reinforcing fibres having a

length of from 13 to 100 mm and obtained by metering
reinforcing fibres having a length of from 13 to

100 mm, and also conventional additives if desired,
into fluid plastics in a continuous mixing apparatus

composed of a multi-chamber kneader with more than one
chamber arranged in series, and homogenizing the

mixture under gentle conditions in a manner such that
at least 50% by weight of the reinforcing fibres used

retain at least 90% of their original fibre length, and
then discharging the mixture continuously from the

mixing apparatus. 
Mouldings made from fibre-reinforced
thermoplastics having uniform fibre distribution,

characterized in that they are produced by press-moulding
a web or sheet made from fibre-reinforced

thermoplastics according to Claim 6.
Process for producing mouldings from fibre-reinforced
thermoplastics, characterized in that the

fibre-reinforced plastics produced according to one of
Claims 1 to 5 are separated into portions after

discharge from the mixing apparatus and directly fed to
a moulding press and that mouldings are produced

therein.
