<ABSTRACT>
A steerable catheter (8) suitable for radiofrequency ablation of cardiac tissue comprises a catheter shaft (35) with a deflectable tip (16) at the distal end of the shaft. The tip is deflected by means of a shapable handle (24) coupled to pull wires fastened to the distal end of the deflectable tip. A core wire (42) extends from the handle to the distal tip, providing fine positioning of the deflectable tip by applying torque through the core wire to the tip. A spring tube (58) is further provided in the deflectable tip for improved torque transmission and kink-resistance. The catheter has an electrode at the distal end of the deflectable tip for positioning at a target site and applying RF power to accomplish ablation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field 
of electrophysiology. More particularly, this invention 
relates to apparatus for treating cardiac 
arrhythmias. Symptoms of abnormal heart rhythm are generally 
referred to as cardiac arrhythmias, with an abnormally slow 
rhythm being classified as a bradycardia and an abnormally 
rapid rhythm being referred to as a tachycardia. The present 
invention is concerned with the treatment of tachycardias 
which are frequently caused by the presence of an 
"arrhythmogenic site" or "accessory atrioventricular pathway" 
close to the inner surface of one of the chambers of the 
heart. The heart includes a number of normal pathways which 
are responsible for the propagation of signals necessary for 
normal electrical mechanical function. The presence of 
arrhythmogenic sites or accessory pathways can bypass or short 
circuit the normal pathways, potentially resulting in very 
rapid heart contractions, referred to as tachycardias. 
Tachycardias may be defined as ventricular tachycardias (VT's) 
and supraventricular tachycardias (SVT's). VT's originate in 
the left or right ventricle and are typically caused by 
arrhythmogenic sites associated with a prior myocardial 
infarction. SVT's originate in the atria and are typically 
caused by an accessory pathway. Treatment of both ventricular and supraventricular 
tachycardias may be accomplished by a variety of approaches, 
including drugs, surgery, implantable 
pacemakers/defibrillators, and catheter ablation. While drugs 
may be the treatment of choice for many patients, they only 
mask the symptoms and do not cure the underlying cause. 
Implantable devices only correct the arrhythmia after it 
occurs. Surgical and catheter-based treatments, in contrast,  
 
will actually cure the problem, usually by ablating the 
abnormal arrhythmogenic tissue or accessory pathway 
responsible for the tachycardia. The catheter-based 
treatments rely on the application of various destructive 
energy sources to the target tissue, including direct current 
electrical energy, radiofrequency electrical energy, laser 
energy, and the like. Of particular interest to the present invention are 
radiofrequency (RF) ablation protocols which have proven to be 
highly effective in tachycardia treatment while exposing the 
patient to minimum side effects and risks. Radiofrequency 
catheter ablation is generally performed after an initial 
mapping procedure where the locations of the arrhythmogenic 
sites and accessory pathways are determined.
