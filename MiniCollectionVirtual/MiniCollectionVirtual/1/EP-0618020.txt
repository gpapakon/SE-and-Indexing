<ABSTRACT>
A method for rolling the strip (3;4) in a hot-strip mill (6) having at least two rolling stands (6,7) with horizontally adjustable upper and lower work rolls (10,11) each of which is supported directly or by way of an intermediate roll on a back-up roll (9), or in a reversing stand on which at least two passes are performed, in which the strip is subjected to state control, for which purpose profile-and flatness-determining final control elements act on the strip, makes it possible to meet the requirements relating to the profile accuracy and flatness of the strip despite flexible rolling programs if a target contour for the profile of the strip (3;4) is specified, for the achievement of which two groups of final control elements act successively on the strip, the final control elements (12,13) of the first group being brought into action when the thickness of the strip is above the critical thickness and primarily influencing the contour of the strip in its central area relative to the centre of the strip, while the final control elements (12,13) of the second group are brought into action when the thickness of the strip in the region of the edge is below the critical thickness.

Method of rolling a roll strip in a hot strip rolling train, 
which comprises at least two roll stands with horizontally adjustable 

upper and lower working rolls, each of which is supported at a 
backing roll either directly or by way of an intermediate roll, or in 

a reversing stand at which at least two passes are rolled, in which 
the roll strip is subjected to a condition regulation, characterised 

thereby that a target contour of the profile of the roll strip is 
preset, for the attainment of which successively two groups of 

setting elements act on the roll strip, of which the setting elements 
of the first group are brought into use in the case of roll strip 

thicknesses lying above the critical thickness and predominantly 
influence the contour of the roll strip in the middle region thereof 

referred to the strip centre, whilst the setting elements of the 
second group are brought into use in the case of roll strip 

thicknesses, which lie below the critical thickness, in the strip 
edge region. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
preset target thickness of the strip profile is described by a 

polynominal function

wherein Y represents the strip thickness co-ordinate and X the strip 

width co-ordinate. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that in 
the case of a strip profile shape departing from the target contour 

the mechanical setting elements are so brought into use that a 
minimum deviation between the achieved Strip shape and the desired 

strip shape or target contour results. 
Method according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby that the mechanical setting elements are brought into use as 

early as possible.  
 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby 
that the mechanical setting elements are assisted by non-mechanical 

setting elements. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised thereby 
that working rolls used as mechanical setting elements are locally 

heated in targeted manner. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby 
that working rolls used as mechanical setting elements are ground 

during the rolling operation.
