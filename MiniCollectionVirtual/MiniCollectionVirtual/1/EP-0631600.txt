<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a commercially 
effective process for the production of an ethanol 
solution of the ethyl or butyl half-ester of a 
copolymer of maleic anhydride and a methyl vinyl ether. 
US-A-4939198 describes a solution feed, solution 
polymerization process for the production of alcoholic 
solutions of alkyl half-esters of copolymers of maleic 
anhydride and an alkyl vinyl ether using acetone as 
solvent. EP-A-310097 describes a similar process in 
which a portion of the monomer reactants were dissolved 
initially in precharged acetone as solvent, and the 
remainder was metered over several hours. In the first 
step of the present invention, the monomers are 
copolymerized in acetone as solvent in a predetermined 
manner to provide an acetone solution of the copolymer 
which is substantially colorless and odorless. The 
copolymer preferably has a predetermined specific 
viscosity corresponding to a K-value of 30-40; and it 
is present suitably in a high solids content, 
preferably about 48% or more, in the solution. At this 
point, the solution is substantially free of residual 
monomers, e.g. less than 2.3% methyl vinyl ether, or 
side reaction products between monomers and solvent, 
such as might arise by reaction between maleic 
anhydride and water present in the acetone solvent to 
produce maleic acid. The process thus comprises: 
(a) copolymerizing the monomers in acetone as 
solvent by simultaneously feeding molten maleic 
anhydride, a molar excess of methyl vinyl ether, and a 
solution of a free radical initiator in acetone, into a 
reactor precharged with acetone, at 68°-85°C, 
preferably 70°-80°C; (b) esterifying the acetone solution of said  
 
copolymer with ethanol or butanol; and (c) solvent exchanging ethanol for acetone in 
said esterified copolymer solution by continuously 
injecting vapors of ethanol at about 85°-95°C into said 
esterified copolymer solution while simultaneously 
distilling out acetone therefrom at atmospheric 
pressure. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the 
process is carried out by sparging the ethanol vapors below 
the surface of the copolymer solution to maintain the 
solution in an agitated state during distillation of 
acetone. Copolymerization of the monomers in acetone is 
carried out in the presence of a free radical initiator, 
preferably an alkyl or acryl peroxide or a peroxy ester. When ethanol is used for both esterification and 
solvent exchange, these steps may be carried out 
simultaneously upon addition of the ethanol
