<ABSTRACT>
An aromatic polysulfone produced by introducing a group represented by the general formula (I): A-CH (R¹)-CO-N 
(R²)-CH₂- as the side chain into the aromatic nucleus of the main chain, and a product of molding thereof. In said formula 

(I), A represents halogen, hydroxy, amino compound residue, acyloxy, alkoxy, phenoxy or sulfide; and R¹ and R², which 
may be the same or different from each other, represent each hydrogen or lower alkyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aromatic 
polysulfone polymer having an aromatic nucleus to which 
an acylamidomethyl group with a halogen atom, hydroxyl 
group, amino compound residual group, acyloxyl group, 
alkoxyl group, steroid residual group, or sulfide group 
is introduced as a side chain, a molded article thereof 
same, and a process for production thereof, more 
specifically, it relates to an acylamidomethylated 
aromatic polysulfone polymer capable of being suitably 
used for the absorption, separation, immobilization, etc. 
of ionic substances, bioactive substances, etc., a shaped 
article thereof, and a process for production thereof. Heretofore, specific bioactive substances etc. 
immobilized to an insoluble carrier have been made wide 
use of as adsorbents for affinity chromatography, 
therapeutic blood treatment agents, cell culturing 
equipment, antibiotic materials, analytical reagents, 
etc. This is an important field in which further broader 
applications may be expected in the future. Polymers having reactive functional groups are 
usable for immobilization of bioactive substances, so are 
useful as materials for affinity chromatography 
adsorbents, therapeutic blood treatment agents, 
antibiotic materials, etc. As a polymer having reactive 
functional groups, derivatives of polystyrene are well 
known, but these are brittle polymers and therefore, 
there are limits to their molding. For example, they 
have the defect that they cannot be molded into hollow  
 
fibers or catheters. Aromatic polysulfones are good in moldability, and 
therefore, are made wide use of as engineering plastics. 
Some are also used in the form of hollow fibers for 
applications for separating substances. If reactive 
functional groups are introduced to this polysulfone, the 
product can be used for immobilization of bioactive 
substances, the selective separation of substances, etc. 
and broader applications can be expected. Reactions for introducing reactive functional groups 
to a polysulfone, however, are not much known. There are 
only a few examples, such as a sulfonating reaction (A. 
Noshay, L.M. Robeson, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 
20, 1885 (1976)), a halomethylating reaction (Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 51-8179,
