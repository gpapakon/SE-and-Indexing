<ABSTRACT>
This invention features a yarn tensioning device comprising a freely rotatable pulley (P) mounted at the end of a spindle (5), the yarn engaging the surface of the pulley. This pulley is associated with a braking system constituted by permanent magnets (19) that can be moved away or towards said pulley. The control of the spacing is provided by a first set (23, 24) which exerts a thrust aimed at bringing the magnet support (20) towards the ring (18) associated with the pulley (P); a second set (25, 32) exerting a counter-thrust aimed at spacing the magnets (19). This counter-thrust is obtained by compressed air, the supply of which is provided simultaneously on all the yarn tensioning devices of the machine through a pneumatic feeder line.

A yarn tension device comprising :

a pulley (P) mounted freely rotatably at the end of a shaft (15) carried
by a housing (21), the yarn being in contact against the surface of said pulley ;
means for braking said pulley (P) which consist of concentrically
arranged permanent magnets (19) locked in terms of rotation relative to the shaft

(15) and arranged opposite a ring (18) made of ferromagnetic material and
mounted on the bearing (13) supporting the pulley (P);
means making it possible to vary the spacing between the magnets (19)
and the pulley-carrying bearing (13) by sliding one of these elements on the shaft

(15), said means consisting in a first assembly (23,24) exerting a thrust tending to
bring the support (20) of the magnets (19) nearer to the ring (18) associated with

the pulley (P), to a predetermined minimum value ;

   characterized in that the means for adjusting the spacing between the
magnets (19) and the pulley (P) to be braked comprise a second assembly (25,32)

exerting a counterthrust of adjustable value, tending to move the magnets (19)
away from the ring (18), said counterthrust means consisting of a compressed-air

source (36) acting on the face (26) of a piston (32) which is mounted fixedly on the
shaft (15) and bears against a bearing surface (29) of the latter and the other face

(27) of which is subjected to the action of the first thrust means (23), compressed
air being supplied simultaneously to all the tension devices which the machine

comprises by means of a pneumatic line (37).
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the variation
in the spacing between the magnets (19) and the ring (18) associated with the

pulley (P) is obtained by displacing said magnets (19) longitudinally on the shaft
(15) carrying the pulley, said shaft in that case being mounted fixedly on the frame

of the machine.
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the variation
in the spacing between the magnets (19) and the ring (18) associated with the

pulley (P) is obtained by displacing the shaft (15) supporting said pulley, fastening
to the frame of the machine being carried out by means of the housing (21)

supporting the magnets (19). 
A textile apparatus equipped with a tension device as claimed in one
of claims 1 and 3, comprising a plurality of identical workstations, wherein the

tension devices (8) are adjusted simultaneously on all the feeders of the machine
which perform the same function.
