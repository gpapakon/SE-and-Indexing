<ABSTRACT>
A bi-metallic switch element 10 has a contact wire 26 attached thereto by means of 
a plurality of crimps. A first crimp 28 applied at a first pressure fixes the contact 

wire to the element and a second crimp 30, formed at a lesser, more controlled 
pressure aligns the contact wire in a predetermined location.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to bi-metallic switch elements and more particularly 
to such elements having better control over the location of a contact wire which is a 
part of the element. The element can form a part of a switch which can be 
employed in the starting circuitry of high intensity discharge lamps. The basic elements of a bi-metal switch include at least a bi-metal member which 
usually is elongated and which can have a contact wire attached thereto. Generally, 
it is important that the contact wire be accurately positioned on the bi-metal. Two 
major forms of attachment have been employed in the past. A first simply involves 
welding the contact wire to the bi-metal and a second involves attaching the wire by 
means of a crimp. The latter method has been accomplished by stamping either a 
tunnel or a pair of tabs from the bi-metal, laying a wire in the opening thus 
provided, and crimping the tabs or tunnel to the wire. While these methods 
provided an adequate holding means for the wire they did not provide for accurate 
location, since very often the force applied to fix the wire disturbed whatever 
previous location had been determined. US-A-5,187,416 according to the precharacterizing part of claim 
1 discloses bi-metallic switch element which comprises an 
elongated bi-metallic member consisting of a relatively high 
expansion material and a relatively low expansion material in 
an operative, intimate contact with one another. One tunnel is 
provided in a first end of said bi-metallic member which 
projects upwardly for inserting and fixing an electrically 
conductive conduct wire to said tunnel. It is, therefore, an object of the invention to obviate the disadvantages of the prior 
art. It is another object of the invention to enhance bi-metal switch elements. Yet another object of the invention is the enhancement of the operation of bi-metal 
switch elements.  
 These objects are accomplished, in one aspect of the invention, by the provision of a 
bi-metallic switch element which comprises an elongated bi-metallic member having 
a longitudinal axis and comprised of a relatively high expansion material and a  
 
relatively low expansion material in operative, intimate contact with one another. 
Two spaced apart tunnels are formed in a first end of the member and project 
upwardly from the high expansion material. The tunnels are formed transverse to 
the longitudinal axis. An elongated, electrically conductive contact wire has one 
end thereof positioned in the tunnels. Crimps

<CLAIMS>
A bi-metallic switch element comprising: 

an elongated bi-metallic member (12) having a 
longitudinal axis (14) and comprised of a relatively high 

expansion material (16) and a relatively low expansion 
material (18) in operative, intimate contact with one 

another, 
wherein at least one tunnel (20;22) is formed in a first 
end (24) of said member (12) and projected upwardly from 

said high expansion material (16), arcuate projections 
forming said at least one tunnel (20;22) being transverse 

to said longitudinal axis (14), 
characterized in that
two spaced apart tunnels (20,22) are formed in the first 
end (24) of said member (12) and project upwardly from 

said high expansion material (16), arcuate projections 
forming both tunnels (20,22) being transverse to said 

longitudinal axis (14). 
The bi-metallic switch element of claim 1 wherein an 
elongated, electrically conductive contact wire (26) has 

one end thereof positioned in said tunnels (20,22).  
 
The bi-metallic switch element of claim 2 wherein another 
end of said contact wire (26) projects beyond a second 

end (23) of said elongated bi-metallic element (12). 
The bi-metallic switch element of claim 3 wherein each of 
said tunnels (20,22) is crimped to said wire (26), each 

of said tunnels (20,22) thereby separated into two tabs 
(28A,28B;30A,30B) said tabs (28A,28B;30A,30B) being 

asymmetric with respect to a centerline of said 
elongated bi-metallic member (12), and the tabs (28A,28B) 

of the (20) first of said tunnels (20,22) being 
asymmetric with respect to the tabs (30A,30B) of the 

second (22) of said tunnels (20,22) . 
The bi-metallic switch element of claim 1 wherein crimps 
(28,30) are formed in said tunnels (20,22), wherein a 

first crimp (28) formed in a first (20) of said tunnels 
(20,22) fixing an elongated, electrically conductive 

contact wire (28) to said bi-metallic element (12) and a 
second crimp (130) formed in a second (22) of said 

tunnels (20,22) positioning said wire (26) in a 
predetermined location relative to the bi-metallic 

element (12).
