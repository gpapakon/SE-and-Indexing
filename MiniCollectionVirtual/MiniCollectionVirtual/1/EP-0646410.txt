<ABSTRACT>
A hydrogenation reaction catalyst precursor of the 
present invention comprises a catalyst carrier (A) and a 

metal oxide composition (B) carried on or mixed with the 
catalyst carrier (A) at a weight ratio of (B)/(A) = 15/85 

to 65/35; the catalyst carrier (A) comprising a carrier 
base material of silica, alumin
a silica-alumina, magnesia, zirconia, 
zeolite or diatomaceous earth, and a coating of titanium 

oxide and/or titanium hydroxide, the metal oxide 
composition (B) comprising copper oxide, zinc oxide, and 

at least one oxide of a metal selected from the group 
consisting of an element of group IIa of the periodic 

table, an element of group IIIb of the table, a lantanide 
element, and an actinide element at a weight ratio of 

100/(0 to 25)/(0 to 25). A hydrogenation reaction catalyst 
with a high catalytic activity and a high reaction 

selectivity is obtained by reduction of the hydrogenation 
reaction catalyst precursor. By the use of the 

hydrogenation reaction catalyst of the present invention, 
a high quality alcohol can be produced at a high yield and 

with a high selectivity even at a low reaction temperature 
and a low hydrogen pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydrogenation
reaction catalyst precursor, to a process for production
thereof, to a hydrogenation reaction catalyst, and to a
process for producing an alcohol using the hydrogenation
reaction catalyst.In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 1-305042
and 5-177140 (corresponding US Patent Nos. are
4,918,248 and USP 5,229,346, respectively), there is
disclosed a process for producing an alcohol utilizing a
copper-zinc hydrogenation reaction catalyst precursor
having a copper-zinc catalytic component carried on a
titanium oxide and/or titanium hydroxide carrier base
material. The copper-zinc catalyst precursor undergoes
reductive activation and exhibits a high catalytic
activity and a high reaction selectivity in alcohol
production.However, the titanium oxide and/or titanium hydroxide
carrier base material of the catalyst precursors disclosed
in the above publications, e.g., a commercially available
titanium oxide which has a large surface area and a
titanium oxide and/or titanium hydroxide which is obtained
by hydrolysis of an alkoxide of titanium, are expensive as 
compared with ordinary carrier materials such as silica,
alumina, silica-alumina, and zeolite. Therefore, the
catalyst precursor using the titanium oxide and/or
titanium hydroxide as a carrier base material has a
problem of a high production cost. In addition, for
further enhancement of the economical efficiency of
alcohol production on an industrial scale, further
improvement in catalytic activity and reaction selectivity
has been sought.On the other hand, a hydrogenation reaction catalyst
using a less expensive carrier base material such as
silica, alumina, and zeolite, instead of titanium oxide
and/or titanium hydroxide, seemed to be significantly
inferior to those using titanium oxide and/or titanium
hydroxide in catalytic activity and reaction selectivity.
Therefore, it has generally been thought that a catalyst
using a material other than titanium oxide and/or titanium
hydroxide as a carrier base material cannot practically be
employed for alcohol production. EP-A-345695 relates to catalysts for the selective catalytic
reduction of NOx by ammonia. These catalysts are made from
porous formed supports having a certain fraction of the pores
with a pore diameter larger than 600 Å. Thus, macropores can
be introduced in a formed TiO2 support by adding burn-out
material or some inorganic oxide prior to forming the titania
into the formed support. Alternatively, titania is
precipitated onto a porous
