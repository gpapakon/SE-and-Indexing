<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a modified polyurea-polyurethane
RIM composition, molded articles of a modified
polyurea-polyurethane RIM composition, and a method of
forming a modified polyurea-polyurethane molded article.Polyurethane polymers prepared from an active
hydrogen-containing compound and an isocyanate are widely
employed in molding processes, particularly reaction
injection molding (hereinafter RIM) processes. RIM
articles are finding increased usage as automotive fascia.The basic polyurethane polymer systems are typically
based on an OH polyol component, an OH cross-linker and an
isocyanate component. However this system suffers from
long cream, demolding and cycle times, greatly increasing
the processing time. Modifications to the basic
polyurethane system to shorten these processing times have
been achieved through substitution of the OH cross-linker
with an aminic cross-linking system. Typically,
thermosetting urethane polymer compositions comprise an 
modulus by increasing the functionality of the polyol
component also suffers from "cold break".In addition to the mechanical properties of the
polyurethane polymer, the processing of the polymer systems
plays an important role in the usefulness of a polyurethane
system. In RIM processing, a short gel time is desired to
increase the productivity of the overall process. However,
polyurethane systems based on an OH polyol component, an OH
cross-linker and an isocyanate component had a gel time of
from 5-8 seconds and a cycle time of from 3-3.5 min.
Polyurethane systems using -NH2 crosslinkers and -OH polyols
(for example U.S. 4,595,742, 4,631,298, and 4,786,656)
reduced the gel time to about 1.2 seconds and the cycle
time to 1.5-2 min. This greatly increased the productivity
of RIM processes using these systems, but these -NH2
crosslinkers and -OH polyols systems suffered from an
inability to increase the flexural modulus above 30,000 psi
without observing "cold break", without the addition of
fillers.Polyurea systems based on amine terminated polyether
resins and aminic cross-linkers have been developed (U.S.
4,396,729, 4,433,067 and 4,444,910), which afford superior
heat resistance and mechanical properties. Due to the
extremely high reactivity of the amine terminated polyether
resin, the gel times are extremely short, in the range of
0.7 seconds and the demold times are very short. Such a 
isocyanate component with an excess of isocyanate groups
and an aromatic diamine as a chain extender, to form a
polyurea-type urethane polymer. Optionally,
