<ABSTRACT>
Milling tool with a shank-shaped support, which is rotatable about its longitudinal axis and has at one end an end slot (56) for accommodating a cutting tip (10), and a cutting tip (10) fastened in the slot and having a cutting-edge pair with two cutting edges (26, 28, 42, 44) running on radially opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the support. The cutting edges (26, 28, 42, 44) are formed by the outline of the cutting tip at the base of two adjacent, stepped recesses (30, 32, 38, 40), arranged on opposite sides of the cutting tip (10), of half the cutting-tip thickness, a total of two identical cutting-edge pairs (26, 42; 28, 44) being provided on opposite sides of the cutting tip (10), and the slot being of complementary form at its base with regard to a cutting-edge pair.

Milling cutter having a shank-shaped support (52)
which is adapted to rotate about its longitudinal axis and

incorporates a cutter head (54), and

having a cutting tip (10) which is inserted in a slot (56)
at the front of the head (54) and mounted in the head

(54), and which has two identical cutting edge pairs, each
with two cutting edges (26, 44; 28, 42) situated one

behind the other in the cutting tip's periphery, said
edges being aligned on opposed faces of the tip and formed

by step-shaped recesses (30, 40; 32, 38) situated on both
faces of the tip, with a pair of cutting edges having two

cutting edges extending on radially opposite sides of the
longitudinal axis of the support,

characterised in that
all the cutting edges (26, 44; 28, 42) are situated in the
middle plane (50) of the cutting tip (10) and immediately

follow one another in the circumferential direction of the
cutting tip (10),
the stepped recesses (30, 40; 32, 38) are constituted by
plane surfaces situated on half the thickness of the tip

and plane flanks (18, 36; 20, 34) which ascend diagonally
in relation thereto towards the full thickness of the tip,

and
the floor (72) and adjoining side walls (68, 70) of the
slot (56) are of complementary construction to a cutting

edge pair with recesses (30, 40; 20, 34).
Milling cutter according to claim 1, characterised
in that from the plane (50) which bisects the thickness of

the tip, the edges (46, 48) of the cutting tip (10) are
bevelled back to the cutting edges (22, 44; 28, 42).
Milling cutter according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the cutting tip (10) features a 

central mounting hole (12) and that in the region of the
slot (56) the support (52) features correspondingly

arranged holes (58, 60) in alignment, one of which (58) is
threaded to receive a straining screw (62).
Milling cutter according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the cutting tip (10) is perfectly

circular, that the cutting edges (24, 44; 28, 42) in each
case occupy a quarter of the circle and that the flanks

(18, 36; 20, 34) of the recesses (30, 40; 32, 38) are in
a square arrangement.
Milling cutter according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the cutting tip (10) has a

substantially elliptical outline and that the cutting
edges (24, 44; 28, 42) in each case extend between the

points of intersection of the main axes (14, 16) with the
circumference of the ellipse.
Milling cutting according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the cutting tip (10) has a square

outline and that the cutting edges (86, 88) in each case
extend between the points of intersection of the axes (74,

76) of the square with the circumference thereof, and that
the outline of the square is retracted slightly towards

the points of intersection of the axes (74, 76) of the
square with the circumference thereof.
