<ABSTRACT>
A switching type power supply apparatus decreases the amount of power 
used in computer and computer peripheral devices by utilizing a switching 

transistor which is set into switching operation responsive to a pulse signal 
received from a power source control circuit. This switching transistor 

controls the voltage applied to the primary winding of the power transformer 
by the switching transistor, and issues an output voltage from the secondary 

winding. The power supply apparatus includes a switch circuit which is 
connected in series to the starting resistor for supplying the output voltage 

rectified from the AC power source when starting up to the power supply 
control circuit. The power supply apparatus includes a switch control circuit 

which turns off the switch circuit when the output voltage rectified from the 
AC output of the tertiary winding of the power transformer reaches a voltage 

high enough for stable operation of the power supply control circuit. As a 
result, the power loss at the starting resistor is curtailed after startup of 

the switching type power supply apparatus such that the power consumption of 
the power-saving operation is also curtailed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power source apparatus of computer,
display and other computer peripheral devices.Recently, in the computer and computer peripheral device market, a power-saving
function for decreasing the power consumption of these devices when not
in the energized state is desired. In these devices, a switching type power
supply apparatus is used. Suppressing the power consumption by several
watts by the power-saving function, requires a reduction in the power
consumption at the primary side.Such a power supply apparatus is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows a circuit
diagram of a conventional switching type power supply device; a stabilizing
control circuit for stabilizing the output voltage is omitted.As shown in Fig. 5, a power supply rectifying diode 1 rectifies an
alternating-current (AC) voltage into a direct-current (DC) voltage, and a 
smoothing capacitor 2 smooths the rectified voltage. A starting resistor 3
supplies this rectified and smoothed voltage to a power supply control circuit
4. The power supply control circuit 4 issues pulse signals, and the base of a
switching transistor 5 is connected to this power supply control circuit 4.
The primary winding 6a of a power transformer 6 is connected to the collector
of the switching transistor 5, thereby supplying the rectified and smoothed
voltage. The power transformer 6 possesses secondary winding 6b and tertiary
winding 6c aside from the primary winding 6a. A pulse voltage generated in
the tertiary winding 6c is rectified and smoothed by a diode 7 and a capacitor
8, and its output voltage is supplied to both ends of the power supply control
circuit 4. The pulse voltage generated in the secondary winding 6b is
rectified and smoothed by a diode 9 and a capacitor 10, thereby yielding an
output voltage.Explaining the operation, first, when an AC voltage is fed to a terminal
a, the AC voltage is rectified and smoothed by the power supply rectifying
diode 1 and smoothing capacitor 2, and the voltage at point b is raised.
Along with the elevation of the voltage at point b, a voltage is supplied to
the power supply control circuit 4 through the starting resistor 3. When the
voltage at the power supply terminal c of the power supply control circuit 4
reaches a specific voltage, the power supply control circuit 4 issues a pulse 
signal, and this pulse signal puts the switching transistor 5 into switching
operation. By the switching operation of the switching transistor 5, a pulse
voltage is generated in the primary winding 6a of the
