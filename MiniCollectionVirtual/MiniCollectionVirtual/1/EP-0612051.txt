<ABSTRACT>
Sleeve intended to be placed around a container such as a can or the like so as to constitute an information medium, and formed by a body (10) made from a sheet of plastic which is shaped to fit round the periphery of the container and able to accommodate printing on its outside, the sleeve further including a part affixed removably on to the sleeve body, characterised by a removable part (4) with a large surface area able to accommodate or exhibit printing on at least one of its faces and secured to the sleeve body (10) by its two edges (6, 7) which are parallel to the generatrix of the sleeve body (10), while a pre-cutout (5) or similar detaching means is provided on the removable part (4) in order to detach it, in the vicinity of its two edges (6, 7).

Method for the manufacture of sleeves 
that are to be placed around a container, such as 

a can or the like, to form an information support, 
characterised in that a sleeve body (10) which is 

shaped to fit onto the circumference of the 
container is produced from a sheet (1) of plastics 

material, and in that a removable portion (4) 
likewise produced from a sheet of plastics 

material is added to the sleeve body (10) and is 
fixedly joined thereto by two edges (6, 7) 

parallel to the generator of the sleeve body, by a 
means of fixed joining, such as welding or the 

like, in such a manner that the removable portion 
(4) covers all or part of the sleeve body (10), 

and a pre-cut (5) is formed in the removable 
portion (4) in the vicinity of the edges (6, 7) in 

order to enable the removable portion (4) to be 
detached. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the sleeve body (10) and the 

removable portion (4) are produced from the same 
sheet (1) of plastics material divided 

longitudinally into three portions, a central 
portion (2) surrounded by two side portions 

(3, 4), in that, by folding, a first side portion  
 

(3) is turned down onto the central portion (2), 
then the second side portion (4), which is to form 

the removable portion (4), is turned down over the 
first (3) by bringing the free edge (6) of the 

second portion (4) into the vicinity of the 
folding line between the other two portions of 

sheet (2, 3), in that the three sheet portions are 
welded together longitudinally in the vicinity of 

each of the two folding lines, and in that, in the 
vicinity of the welds so formed, a pre-cut (5) is 

formed in the side portion (4) that is to form the 
removable portion. 
Method according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the sleeve body and the 

removable portion are produced from the same sheet 
of plastics material previously folded in two, or 

from a sheath of the same material, in that 
folding is carried out to provide four thicknesses 

of sheet and suitable welds and pre-cuts are 
produced, in order to obtain, from two sheet 

thicknesses, the sleeve body and, from the other 
two sheet thicknesses, the removable portion in 

the form of a sheath, in the form of a double 
sheet to be opened or in the 
form of two removable 
portions of sheet.  

 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the sheet is produced 

from polyethylene and has undergone, on its face 
that is to be directed towards the outside when 

the sleeve is in place on a container, a treatment 
enabling it to receive print. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the sleeves are 

manufactured continuously from a roll of preprinted 
plastics material.
