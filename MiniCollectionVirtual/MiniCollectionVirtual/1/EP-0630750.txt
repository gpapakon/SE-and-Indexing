operation is carried out while a recording head having 

a plurality of recording elements arranged on a line 
is reciprocated includes pattern printing device for 

printing adjustment patterns through a plurality of

plurality of recording elements of the recording head 
are different so that relative position between an odd 

number line and an even number line in direction of 
the reciprocation, are slightly deviated; and

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus having a recording head having a plurality
of recording elements aligned on a line.A so-called serial type recording apparatus
(serial printer) having a carriage carrying a
recording head reciprocable in a direction
perpendicular to a sheet feeding direction in which
paper OHP sheet or another recording material is fed,
uses various types of carrying method of the recording
head. The recording head used in the serial printer
may be a wire dot type, heat-sensitive type, thermal
transfer type, ink jet type or the like. Among the
various types of the serial printer, the ink jet type
is advantageous in that the running cost is low
because the ink is directly ejected on the recording
sheet, and the noise in the recording is small. In
the ink jet type, the recording head is spaced from a
recording material, non-contact type, and the load
required for moving the carriage is low, and
therefore, advantageous in high speed printing. In
addition to that, the limitation to the printing
direction is smaller than in the thermal type, and
therefore, bi-directional printing can be easily 
accomplished. In addition, since the ink is ejected
only to the required portion, color printing with low
running cost is easy. For these reasons, it is
particularly noted.Conventionally, when a vertical line is to be
printed as shown in Figure 14, in the serial type
printer, the lines printed for each lines are inclined
if the recording head is not positioned correctly on
the carriage, and therefore, the recorded line is not
straight.In a printer having a built-in recording head
(permanent type) in which the positional relation
between the recording head and the carriage are
definitely determined, the inclination can be avoided
by increasing the accuracies of the parts and
assembling accuracy and by making adjustment for
individual printers during assembling operation.
However, there arises a problem that the cost of parts
is increased, and the detection of the inclination of
the printing is difficult with the result of long time
adjustment with the result of higher assembling cost.Particularly, in a printer using a
replaceable recording head in which the positional
relation between the recording head and the carriage
is not definitely determined, the above-described
adjustment during the assembling operation is
unavailable. For this reason, there arises a problem 
of crooked vertical lines due to the variation of the
recording head and the variation in the mounting
position

A recording apparatus for printing on a recording
medium (5) by reciprocating a recording head (6) having

a linear array of recording elements along a main
scanning direction to allow printing during both forward

and backward scans of the recording head and effecting
relative movement between the recording head and the

recording medium in a subsidiary scanning direction
between scans of the recording head along the main

scanning path, comprising:

means (40, 46, 16, 47) for causing the recording
head to print adjustment patterns extending in a

direction substantially perpendicular to the main scanning direction by

scanning path so that each adjustment pattern comprises
three parts with the middle of the three parts being

printed during scanning of the recording head in the
opposite direction from the other two parts and with the

driving timings of the recording elements being selected
so that different adjustment patterns have different

degrees of misalignment in the main scanning direction
between the parts of the adjustment pattern; and
means (40, 46) for controlling the drive timing of
the recording elements during recording of an image on 

the basis of the adjustment pattern which most closely
resembles a straight line in the subsidiary scanning

direction.
