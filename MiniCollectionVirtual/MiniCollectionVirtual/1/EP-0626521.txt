<ABSTRACT>
In order to provide a manifold valve in which the 
overall height thereof can be lowered, a manifold base (10) is 

constituted by a fitting portion (18) with tube fittings (26,28) 
being attached to output openings (22,24) which open in a 

vertical direction on one side surface of the fitting 
portion (18), and a base portion (20) having a height lower than 

that of the fitting portion (18). A directional control valve 
(12) is constituted by a main valve (60) and a pilot valve (62) 

which is displaced upwardly from the main valve and attached 
at a height approximately equal to a difference in height 

between the fitting portion (18) and the base portion (20) from 
a lower surface of the main valve (60). The main valve (60) is 

disposed on the base portion (20), and the pilot valve (62) is 
disposed on or adjacent the fitting portion (18), wherein the 

directional control valve (12) is integrated with the manifold 
base (10). Since the height of the base portion (20) can be 

lowered owing to the displacement of the attachment position 
of the pilot valve (62) with respect to the main valve (60), the 

entire height and length of the manifold valve can be 
reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manifold valve in 
which directional control valves are provided on manifold 
bases. A manifold valve, in which directional control valves 
are installed on manifold bases each having a supply flow 
passage and exhaust flow passages for a pressurized fluid in 
order to collectively supply and exhaust the pressurized 
fluid to and from a plurality of directional control valves, 
has been already known, for which no special exemplary 
illustration may be necessary. In such a manifold valve, a 
plurality of directional control valves are arranged in a 
linking manner, whereby the pressurized fluid can be 
collectively supplied and exhausted to and from each of the 
directional control valves. In the aforementioned manifold valve, two output ports, 
which are provided in each of the directional control 
valves, communicate individually with two output openings 
provided and opened on a frontal surface of the manifold 
base in a vertical direction through output flow passages 
provided in each of the manifold bases, and tube fittings 
for respectively connecting tubes are attached to the two 
output openings.  
 However, the aforementioned tube fittings are restricted 
in diameter in accordance with the diameters of the tubes 
inserted thereinto; and therefore, the tubes and tube 
fittings generally are required to have fixed predetermined 
diameters. Therefore, when two of such tube fittings are 
attached on the frontal surface of the manifold base in a 
vertical direction, a problem arises in that the manifold 
base necessarily has a large height, the entire manifold 
valve has a large occupying space, and it is impossible to 
make the apparatus compact. A known type of manifold valve is shown in Fig. 12. The 
manifold valve 2 comprises a manifold base 4 and a 
directional control valve 6, wherein the directional control 
valve 6 is constituted by a main valve 8 and a pilot valve 
portion 9 including a solenoid. Therefore, since the 
directional control valve 6 is secured on the manifold base 
4, it is inevitable that the height H1 and length L1 of the 
manifold valve 2 are extremely large because the pilot valve 
portion 9 protrudes on the side surface thereof. This problem can be solved by allowing the two output 
openings to be provided and opened in a direction in which 
the manifold bases are linked together, namely in a 
horizontal direction. However, when the output openings are 
provided in such a horizontal direction, a difficult problem 
arises in that the
