<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lock device for window or bay opening frames of the sliding type. This device comprises:     - a standard-size plug-type lock cylinder (11) of European type; - a rack (13) connected to the lock cylinder for the purpose of being set in translational motion as a result of the actuation of the lock, the rack being connected to at least one rod (21), to which is fastened at least one bolt (17) capable of cooperating with a complementary keeper located on the fixed frame; - anti-picking or anti-unhinging means (25) for the closing points, cooperating with the said lock cylinder (11) for the purpose of locking the said rack (13) with the function of securing the lock, all the elements being installed between two walls (3) of an upright profile of the opening frame which are located at a distance D smaller than or equal to 23 mm.

Lockin device for the opening frames of windows or louvres of the 
translational type, comprising: 


a locking barrel cylinder (11) of the European type, having 
standard dimensions, 
a rack (13) connected to the locking cylinder so that it is translated 
by the actuation of the lock, the rack being connected to at least 

one rod (21) to which is fixed at least one bolt (17) capable of 
cooperating with a complementary catch (19) located on the window 

frame, characterised in that it furthermore comprises: 
anti-picklock and anti-unhinging means (25) for the closing points, 
cooperating with said locking cylinder (11) in order to lock said rack 

(13) as a functions of locking the lock, said anti-picklock or anti-unhinging 
means consisting of all of the following parts: 
an anti-picklock pin (25) capable of engaging with a 
complementary aperture (27) in the rack in order to lock it when the 

frame is in the closed position, or of being disengaged from said 
rack to release it and allow the opening of the frame; 
at least one connecting bar (39) with a longitudinal profile, 
articulated and comprising two parts which are opposite relative to 

its axis of articulation, one cooperating with a key bit (45) of the 
locking cylinder, and the other with said anti-picklock pin (25) such 

that the operation of opening the lock in one direction of rotation of 
the key bit causes said anti-picklock pin to be retracted, thereby 

allowing the translation of the rack, and that the operation of closing 
the lock in the opposite direction of rotation causes said pin to 

protrude in order to lock the rack closed, all of said elements, 
locking cylinder (11), rack (13) and anti-picklock and anti-unhinging 

means (25) being mounted between two webs (3) of a vertical 
section of the opening part, located at a distance apart D greater 

than or equal to 23 mm. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that it comprises an 
operating switch (9) mounted on the inside of the opening frame, 

said switch having the same function as that of the locking cylinder 
(11) acting on the one hand by means of a key bit (61) of its nut on 

the rack (13) which supports the bolts, and on the other hand on 
the anti-picking latch (25) by means of a connecting bar mechanism 

similar to that previously described with respect to the barrel 
cylinder; the mechanisms cooperating such that the action upon the 

cylinder is complementary with that of the operating switch and 
vice-versa. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the operating switch (9) and the locking cylinder (11) are 

mounted on either side of the anti-picklock pin (25). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that it comprises an anti-misuse pin (51), said pin being mounted 

with the possibility of being translated transversely with respect to 
the rack (13) and through the end-section (14), returned to the 

exterior such as to project out from the locking device on the frame, 
when the frame is opened, through an opening (55) made in the 

rack in order to lock the latter in the locked position during the 
opening of the frame, thereby preventing the bolts (17) from striking 

against the catches (19) if there is misuse of the lock, and to 

withdraw into the inside of the device under the pressure of a 
complementary stopping element (57) provided on the window 

frame, thereby releasing the rack, once the frame is closed. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that it is additionally fitted on each side of the frame with a handle 

(7) known as a pull, which allows the usual operation of translation  
 

for opening and closing the frame. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the anti-picklock means further comprise: 


a hook piece (47) integral with the axle or anti-picklock pin (25), 
said piece being guided transversally and returned to the rack (13), 

and which cooperates with a lower hook element (49) mounted 
such that it slides vertically and is partially integral with the rack by 

means of a lower supporting piece (52), the hook element (49) 
retaining the hook piece (47) of the anti-picklock pin (25) when the 

locking operation of the locking device begins; 
a connecting bar (39) mounted longitudinally in the space between 
the webs (3) and articulated, comprising an upper arm (41) : 

cooperating with a dog which acts directly upon the part of the hook 
integral with the pin when operation of the locking device by the 

movement of the key bit (45) of the cylinder (11) takes place; 
and an anti-misuse pin (51) mounted such that it slides 
transversally relative to the rack and through the end section (14) 

and returned towards the exterior of the device, said pin being 
screwed to an adjustable length onto a supporting piece (59) 

forming a retaining thrust for the anti-misuse pin by means of the 
clip (23) for joining the rack to the corresponding rod (21) when it 

is displaced during the operation of opening the frame, said pin 
holding the rack in the locked position of the locking device until it 

is released from the clip and thus from the rack when the operation 
of closure of the frame into contact with the window frame onto a 

complementary thrust element (57) takes place. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the bolts (17) are mounted such that their length is adjustable, 

for example by screwing onto their support, such as to allow precise  
 

adjustment of the bolts (17) with respect to the catches (19) in order 
to compensate for a possible faulty alignment of the frame with 

respect to its window frame. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that the distance useable for fitting the device is the distance apart 

(D) between the innermost web (3) and the external face of the 
second web (3), corresponding to the wall of the section (1). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in 
that when the locking device is locked, the lower tongue (73) of the 

supporting piece (52) prevents the key bit (45) of the cylinder from 
moving beyond the movement necessary for carrying out the 

locking of the locking device, and conversely, for the locking of the 
device, the width of the opening (55) in the rack (13) is less than 

that of the key bit (45) preventing it from entering therein to turn in 
the direction opposite the direction necessary for carrying out the 

locking.
