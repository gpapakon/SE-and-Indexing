<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for producing stable endohedral fullerenes of structure Z@Cx, in which x 
>
/= 60. A Z-atom is implanted in the fullerenes and both fullerenes and low energy accelerated Z-particles are produced at the same time and interact with each other in a vacuum vessel. The fullerenes are then withdrawn from the vacuum vessel, dissolved in a solvent and dried. Atoms of non-metals and metalloids are used as Z-atoms. The fullerenes are produced by vapour phase deposition of Cx on a substrate and and the accelerated Z-particles are produced by an ion source and directed onto the growing fullerene layer on the substrate. Alternatively, the fullerenes are produced by evaporating Cx in a furnace through which flows a gas mixture which contains the material to be implanted and the accelerated Z-particles are produced by a high-voltage gas discharge in the same furnace. The disclosed device for producing endohedral fullerenes by means of a high-voltage gas discharge has a cathode which is provided with cooling means and/or has an enlarged surface.

Method for preparing stable endohedral
fullerenes having the structure Z@C
x
 with x ≥ 60,
wherein a Z atom is implanted in the fullerene, as a

result of the fact that simultaneously both fullerenes
and low-energy accelerated Z particles are made

available in a vessel and interact with each other,
then these fullerenes are removed from the vessel,

dissolved in solvent and dried, characterised in that
the provision of the fullerenes takes place by

evaporation of C
x
 in a furnace through which a gas
mixture containing the material to be implanted flows,

and the provision of the accelerated Z particles takes
place by a high-voltage gas discharge in the same

furnace.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that atoms of the non-metals and semi-metals are

implanted as Z atoms.
Method according to claim 2, characterised in
that atoms of the elements C, N, P, O, S, B, Si, Ge and

fullerenes having the structure Z@C
x
 with x ≥ 60 in
accordance with claims 1 to 4, characterised in that

arranged in a high-voltage gas-discharge furnace (2)
are a heated source for the provision of the fullerenes

C
x
