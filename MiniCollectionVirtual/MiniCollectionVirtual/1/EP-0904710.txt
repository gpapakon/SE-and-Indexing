<ABSTRACT>
A bag (1) having at least a handle or strap
(3), including an expandable sack (4) arranged inside it;

means (5, 5a) for actuating the expansion of the sack
(4); means (5', 5a') for priming said means for actuating

(5, 5a), and means (6, 6') for activating said means for
priming (5', 5a') when at least one handle undergoes a

jerk by a bag-snatcher.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-emptying bag,
particularly, though not exclusively, to a long-strap
bag, having a single strap.It is known that a problem in bringing a bag is
represented by the possible bag-snatchings, a
particularly annoying problem in connection with the fact
that it is customary to bring, in addition to cash money
and toilet articles, personal documents and keys too in
bags.Moreover, long-strap bags are particularly
exposed to the danger of bag-snatchings.The object of the present invention is to
provide a bag that has a feature which, though not being
able to avoid a bag-snatching, at least prevents the
consequences thereof allowing the contents of the bag to
be immediately recovered.Such an object is reached by endowing a bag, in
its interior, with a sack means which under a traumatic
stress like a snatcher jerk expands in size causing the
outgoing of the contents of this one, which so can be
immediately picked-up after the bag-snatching.With this contrivance, in fact, after a bag-snatching
the contents are projected out of the bag and
goes to fall to the ground. So the thief remains with the
empty bag in his hands and the bag-snatched person can
pick the contents up.Therefore, it is the subject of the present
invention a self-emptying bag having at least a handle or strap,
characterized in that it includes
expandable means arranged inside it; means for actuating the expansion of said
expandable means;means for priming said means for actuating, andmeans for activating said means for priming
when the at least one handle undergoes a jerk by a bag-snatcher.Another problem of bag-snatchings is that the y
can do a person who brings a bag physical harm.It is a further object of the present invention
to provide a bag as set forth above, that solves this
second problem too.Such a problem is solved according to the
present invention by endowing at least a handle with a
weakness means.Under the impulse of a bag-snatching this
weakness means yields, the handle or strap then breaks in
two parts so that the impulse itself is not transferred
to the arm, the hand or the shoulder of the person who
carries the bag, and causes the priming for the intiation
of the sack means at the same time.Therefore, it is also the subject of the
present invention a bag as set forth above, further
characterized in that the at least one handle or strap is
endowed with a weakness means which makes it yield in
correspondence with it under the impulse of a bag-snatching,
and in that
said means for activating

<CLAIMS>
A self-emptying bag (1) having at least a handle or strap
(3), 
characterized in that
 it includes

expandable means (4) arranged inside it;
means (5, 5a) for actuating the expansion of
said expandable means (4);
means (5', 5a') for priming said means for
actuating (5, 5a), and
means (6, 6') for activating said means for
priming (5, 5a') when the at least one handle undergoes

a jerk by a bag-snatcher.
A bag according to Claim 1, further

characterized in that
 the at least one handle or strap is
endowed with a weakness means (3a) which makes it yield

in correspondence with it under the impulse of a bag-snatching,
and 
in that
said means for activating the means for priming
are comprised of a continuous contact medium provided in

at least one handle and which yields too under the
impulse of a bag-snatching.
