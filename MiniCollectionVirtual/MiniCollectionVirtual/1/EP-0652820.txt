<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the processes for producing plastic 
laminates using metal laminae. Plastic laminates usually consist of sheets formed of a 
number of layers of plastic materials stably associated, 
generally by pressing, on supports of paper, fabrics, fibreglass 
or other materials. The plastic materials used may be of phenol, melamine, epoxy, 
polyester, silicon, fluoride or others. To make printed circuits a metal lamina, especially one of 
copper, is glued onto one or both of their sides during the 
pressing process. A pile is formed of packages all virtually the same, each 
one comprising a certain number of sheets impregnated with 
plastic materials and copper laminae placed one on each side 
of the package. A metal sheet, of stainless steel or some other type, is 
placed between each package, and the pile so formed is put  
 
in a multiple-plate press which simultaneously provides 
heat and pressure. At the end of each heat cycle, in which a temperature of 
190°C may be reached at pressures of up to 100 kg/cm2 lasting 
over 100 minutes including a cooling stage to 70-80°C, 
a compact and rigid product is obtained the single components 
of which are closely associated together. Bearing in mind the many components needed, their nature 
and dimensions, formation of packages is a somewhat lengthy 
and complex process; this raises their cost considerably 
especially in production of laminates for printed circuits. Clearly the presses needed for this process are complex 
and of low output because of the many heating plates in 
them, because of the need to produce simultaneously both 
heat and pressure, with exact timing of these stages, and 
the need to create, by conduction, uniform temperatures 
in the various packages making up the pile of which, obviously, 
only those at each end of it are in contact with 
the heating plates. The presence of many plates in the press not only complicates 
it structure but lengthens the time required for 
loading and unloading packages while preparation of short 
runs is made problematic because relatively more costly. Subject of the invention is a process for production of 
plastic laminates, aimed at simplifying and speeding up 
formation of packages, to enable use to be made of more 
compact and simpler presses and to facilitate transmission 
of calories during the heating stage and of refrigerating 
units during cooling. The package or packages in the pile are made from a multi-component 
band fed in continuously and simultaneously with  
 
bands of

A process for producing plastic laminates with metal 
laminae, especially for printed circuits, by formation 

of packages (51-54) arranged in piles, each package composed 
of a set of sheets of supporting material impregnated 

with plastic material and of metal laminae of 
copper or other suitable material on one or both faces, 

the packages (51,53) having between them metal sheets 
(65,66) of steel or other suitable material, and by application, 

in suitable machines, in a press (60) or autoclave 
(80) or in some other, of pressure and heat sufficient to 

obtain close association among the various  
 

components of the package, 
characterised in that the packages (51-54) in the pile are obtained from a multi-component 

band (45) comprising bands (30-32) of supporting materials, impregnated 
with plastic material and one or two metal bands (33,34) of copper or 

other material, the bands of supporting material and the metal bands being 
feed continuously and simultaneously,  

 
said multicomponent band (45) being progressively laid 

serpentinewise in the machine (60,80), with folds at 180° being 
made between the various superimposed lengths and a metal 

sheet (65,66) of steel or of some other suitable material being 
laid between one length and another. 
Process as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that one end (46) of the multicomponent band 

(45) is placed on a flat surface (61) of the machine (60, 
80) and after a metal sheet (65) has been placed on said end, 

said band is folded at 180° and is matched with the second 
face of said sheet (65) and then, after a second metal sheet 

(66) has been placed upon the band (45) said band is once 
more folded at 180°, but in the direction opposite to that 

of the first fold, and is matched with the second face of the 
second sheet (66) then, after a third metal sheet has been 

laid on, it is once again folded at 180° in the direction opposite  
 

to that of the second fold, and so on in accordance with 
the number of packages (51-54) required, since each length of 

said multicomponent band (45), lying serpentine-wise between 
one sheet and another sheet (65, 66) and consequently between 

one fold and another (47 - 49) , constitutes a package complete 
all the component parts in packages as usually made, and 

in their proper order, it being obviously possible, when 
the process has been terminated, to separate the laminates 

so obtained one from another by cutting the multicomponent 
band (45) at the point where the folds (47-49) are made. 
Process as in claim 2,
 
characterized in that the necessary heat is entirely, or 

partly supplied by connecting the ends (35-36,37-38) of the 
metal bands (33, 34) at the beginning and end of a package 

or pile of packages (51-54) to a suitably powered generator 
(75) of electricity, in which case the metal bands 

in the length between said ends will act as electric resistances. 
Process as in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the various components of the multicomponent 

band (45), both the bands (30, 32) of supporting 
material impregnated with plastic material and also the 

metal bands (33, 34 ), are fed in off reels (40, 44) or off 
other suitable continuous feeding means.
