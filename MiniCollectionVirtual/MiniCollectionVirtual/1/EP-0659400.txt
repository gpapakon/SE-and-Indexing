<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the bleaching of keratinous fibres, which consists in bringing keratinous fibres, to which a bleaching composition containing at least one oxidising agent has been applied, into contact with a gas containing water vapour, the temperature of the aforementioned gas being above 75 DEG C and the contact time between the aforementioned gas and the aforementioned fibres to be bleached being less than ten minutes. A rapid bleaching is obtained which does not give rise to any auburn glint.

<CLAIMS>
Process for bleaching keratinous fibres, 
characterized in that it consists in bringing keratinous 

fibres, to which a bleaching composition containing at 
least one oxidizing agent has been applied, into contact 

with a gas containing water vapour, the temperature of 
the said gas being greater than 75°C and the contact time 

between the said gas and the said fibres to be bleached 
being less than ten minutes. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the gas has a temperature greater than or equal to 

85°C. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the gas has a temperature between 85 and 150°C. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the gas is brought into 

contact with the fibre to be bleached for a period of 
time ranging from 0.01 second to 5 minutes. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the gas is brought into contact with the fibre to be 

bleached for a period of time ranging from 10 seconds to 
3 minutes. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that application of the gas to 

the same fibre is repeated a number of times. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the gas contains solely 

water vapour. 
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the gas contains water vapour and 

at least one other compound in the form of gas or vapour.  
 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the gas contains water vapour and air. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the oxidizing agent is 

chosen from hydrogen peroxide, urea hydrogen peroxide, 
alkali metal bromates, persalts such as perborates and 

persulphates, or organic peracids such as magnesium 
monoperoxyphthalate. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the oxidizing agent is 

present in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10% by 
weight with respect to the total weight of the 

composition.
