<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a method for using certain
phenyl oxazoles and phenyl thiazoles for the treatment of
pain. The present invention provides a method which is
especially useful for the treatment of acute pain and
nociceptive pain.The present invention provides a method for
treating pain.For clinical purposes, pain can be categorized
into three groups: (1) acute pain; (2) continuous pain in
terminally ill patients; and (3) other forms of chronic pain.
In acute pain, a specific noxious stimulant of limited
duration can be identified. The present invention provides
a method for treating acute self-limiting ailments, low-grade
somatic-type acute pain, including for example, but
not limited to headache, arthritis, simple muscle strain,
dysmenorrhea and pain due to inflammation.An additional distinction that is relevant to
chronic pain is the difference between pain caused by a
tissue-damaging process that excites nociceptive afferents
and pain caused by pathologic changes in nociceptive neurons
(neuropathic pain). Nociception refers to the neural
mechanisms by which noxious stimuli are detected.
Nociception involves two steps: transductions of noxious
stimuli by peripheral nerve endings and transmission of
these signals to the central nervous system. Additionally,
this invention provides a method for treating nociceptive
pain.There are drugs used in the treatment of pain
which are known in the literature and to the skilled
artisan. See, for example, Merck Manual, 16th Ed. (1992), 
p. 1409. However, there is a demand for more active
analgesic agents with diminished side effects and toxicity
and which are non-addictive. The ideal analgesic would
reduce the awareness of pain, produce analgesia over a wide
range of pain types, act satisfactorily whether given orally
or parenterally, produce minimal or no side effects, be free
from tendency to produce tolerance and drug dependence.Applicants have discovered that certain phenyl
oxazoles and phenyl thiazoles can provide many of the
characteristics of an ideal analgesic for the treatment of
pain. It is known that these phenyl oxazoles and phenyl
thiazoles are useful for treating neurodegeneration.
Surprisingly, and in accordance with this invention,
Applicants have discovered that these compounds can also be
useful for the treatment of pain and could address a long
felt need for a safe and effective treatment for acute and
nociceptive pain.The present invention provides a method for
treating pain comprising administering to an animal in need
of such treatment
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for treating pain comprising administering
to a mammal in need of such treatment, an analgesic dosage

of a compound of formula I;

wherein


Ar is phenyl or pyridyl substituted with zero to two
substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-C6

alkyl, hydroxy and halo; and
substituted with either:

(i) one or two substituents selected from the
group consisting of


and (C1-C6
alkyl)R6; or
(ii) two substituents which when taken together
with the carbon atoms to which they are

attached form a pyridyl or tetrahydropyridyl
ring;

provided that when substituent pattern (i) is present,
the phenyl or pyridyl group of Ar may additionally be

substituted with two substituents which when taken
together with the carbon atoms to which they are

attached form a phenyl ring;
where R6 is NR7R8, morpholin-1-yl, imidazol-1-yl,
4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl, thiomorpholin-1-yl,

piperazin-1-yl or piperazin-1-yl substituted with
C1-C4 alkyl or


alkyl); and R7 and R8 are
each individually hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, (CH2)pOH

or (CH2)p-piperidyl;
X is O or S;
Y is CHR5, O or S;
R is H or C1-C6 alkyl;
R1 and R2 are each individually C1-C6 alkyl;
R3 is H or C1-C6 alkyl;
R4 is hydrogen, or when Y is CHR5, R4 and R5 are each
individually H or when taken together form a bond;
m is 0 or 1;
n is an integer from 0 to 4 both inclusive; and
p is an integer from 1 to 6 both inclusive;
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or
optical isomer thereof.
The method of Claim 1
where:


Ar is phenyl substituted with one or two substituents
selected from - (CH2)nR6,


-(C1-C6 alkyl)R6
where R6 is NR7R8 and R7 and R8 are H or C1-C6 alkyl;
and one or two substituents selected from hydrogen,
C1-C6-alkyl, hydroxy; or two substituents which when taken

together form a phenyl group.
R1 and R2 are C1-C6 alkyl;
R, R3, R4 and R are H;
X is O
Y is O or S;
The method of Claim 2 where R1 and R2 are 1,1-dimethylethyl.
The method of Claim 3 where Ar is phenyl
substituted with one or two substituents selected from

(CH2)nR6 or (C1-C6 alkyl)R6 and one or two substituents
selected from hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl.
The method of Claim 4 where Ar is phenyl
substituted with (CH2)nR6.
The method of Claim 5 wherein the compound of
formula I is 2-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(2-(4-methylethylaminomethyl-phenyloxy)ethyl)oxazole.
The method of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the
analgesic dosage of the compound of formula I is from

about 0.1 mg to about 30 mg per day.
The method of Claim 7 wherein the analgesic dosage
of the compound of formula I is from about 1 mg to about 20

mg per day.
The method of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the pain is
nociceptive.
The method of Claim 11 wherein the nociceptive
pain is selected from the gr
oup consisting of post-operative
pain, cluster headaches, dental pain, surgical pain, pain

resulting from severe burns, post partum pain, angina pain,
and genitolurinary tract relative pain.
The method of Claims 1 to 6 wherein the pain is
acute.
The method of Claims 11 wherein acute pain is
selected from the group consisting of headache,

arthritis, simple muscle strain, dysmenorrhea and pain
due to inflammation.
