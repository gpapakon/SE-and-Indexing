<ABSTRACT>
A method of providing a textured surface for recording media for a 
disk drive includes the following sequential steps: a) providing a metal substrate 

(10); b) providing a layer of NiP (12) atop the metal substrate, the NiP layer 
having a surface roughness of greater than 2.0 nanometers RMS; c) polishing 

the NiP layer (14) to a surface roughness of less than 2.0 nanometers RMS; and 
d) sputter depositing a metal layer over the polished NiP layer (18) without any 

intervening exposure of the NiP layer to texturing conditions after polishing of 
the NiP layer, the sputter deposited metal layer having a desired textured outer 

surface as a result of the sputter deposition, the textured outer surface being 
characterized by a cobblestone-like metallic grain structure with between 10 and 

100 grains per square micron, an RMS surface roughness of between 1.0 and 
8.0 nanometers, and with peak heights as measured from the mean plane of the 

surface over a 10 micron square area of between 2.0 and 20.0 nanometers. 
The invention includes recording disks produced according to a method and 

disks produced according to other methods which have the same attributes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to reduction of static and dynamic friction 
while achieving low flying height between a recording head and spinning 
recording media in hard disk drives. Hard disks are typically made from polished metal substrates, or 
platters, such as NiP plated aluminum. After polishing, the substrate is coated 
with various thin layers of materials which include magnetic material, and are 
then used either singly or in stacks within a disk-drive housing. Hard disks utilize read/write heads to transfer data to and from the 
disk according to well-known principles of magnetic recording. Unlike floppy 
disk drives, hard disk read/write heads are not in contact with the disk-drive 
surface. Rather, they "fly" or are supported a few millionths of an inch from the 
disk's surface on a thin layer of air produced by the rapidly spinning disk. The mechanical interface between the head and recording media in 
disk drives is viewed by many as one of the most challenging aspects of 
magnetic recording technology. The amount of information that can be packed 
onto a disk is determined in part by the spacing between the read/write 
transducer and disk. A closer spacing produces sharper transitions, allowing the 
data transitions to be recorded much closer together. Accordingly, there is a 
continuing effort to reduce the spacing between the read/write head and disk, 
yet still maintain physical separation between the head and media. Such small 
spacing between the disk and head implies the desirability of a very smooth disk 
surface having excellent flatness. Accordingly, the texture of the recording 
media surface is one component which plays an important role in reliably 
achieving reduced head/disk spacings. The close spacing between a head and disk results in both kinetic 
and static friction. Although when spinning the head and disk are separated by  
 
a layer of air, during spin down the proximity of the two relative to one another 
results in kinetic friction. Static friction, commonly referred to as "stiction", 
occurs when the disk is not rotating and the head contacts the uppermost peaks 
of the disk's surface at rest. Static friction is measured during a repeated series 
of contact start stop (CSS) tests to determine disk reliability and expected life. 
While low flying height is highly desirable and maximized by providing maximum 
smoothness, extremely smooth surfaces place more material of the disk surface 
in contact with the head when the disk is not rotating, thus greatly increasing 
stati
