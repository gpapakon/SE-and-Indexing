<CLAIMS>
Motor vehicle door, including an exterior panel (1), an 
interior panel (2) as well as further units arranged 

between the exterior panel (1) and the interior panel (2) 
such as window winder operating means, door hinges (37, 38) 

and door lock (39) as well as, if occasion arises, with a 
window frame (19) and an outside mirror (21), characterised 

in that the exterior panel (1) and the interior panel (2) 
are formed from extruded light metal profiles (7-10) to be 

joined together in a manner known in the art, and the units 
are mounted directly on the exterior panel (1) or on the 

interior panel (2), integrated in its profile (7-10). 
Motor vehicle door according to claim 1, characterised 
in that three or four extruded profiles (7-10) for forming 

lower elements (3, 4) and upper elements (5, 6) of the 
interior panel (2) and exterior panel (1) are shaped and 

adhered, hooked, riveted, welded, bolted or locked 
together. 
Motor vehicle door according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the extruded profiles (7-10) are 

designed essentially with a smooth surface towards the 
exterior of the door and comprise profile boxes (33-36) and 

profile branches forming longitudinal grooves (40, 41, 42) 
towards the interior of the door. 
Motor vehicle door according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the profile boxes (33-36) and the profile branches 

are resistant to deformation and the units are mounted in 
or on the profile boxes (33-36) and profile branches. 
Motor vehicle door according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that parts of the door hinges (37, 38), 

the door lock (39), the window winder operating means as 
well as a door brake (32) are mounted in the longitudinal 

grooves (40, 41, 42) of the extruded profiles (7-10).  
 
Motor vehicle door according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that in the region of a joint (11) between 

the lower element (4) and the upper element (6) of the 
exterior panel (1), a trim strip (16) or a stabilising 

strip is fitted on outwardly pointing profile lugs (14, 15) 
of the two extruded profiles (8, 10). 
Motor vehicle door according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that in the region of a door lower edge 

(23), a profile branch [profile lug (22)] points in the 

direction of the interior of the vehicle and forms with the 
door lower edge (23) a recess (24) in which an outwardly 

pointing profile branch [profile lug (25)] of a door sill 

(26) engages when the vehicle door is closed.
