<ABSTRACT>
A heat sink fan has a fan motor (1A) provided with 
blades (13), a rectangular upper casing (32) for 

holding the fan motor (1A), and a rectangular lower 
casing (36) fixed to the upper casing. The lower 

casing has a bottom portion (46) and heat dissipating 
fins (50) erected perpendicularly from the four side 

edges of the bottom portion. The upper and lower 
casings are fixed together by a mechanically 

interlocking mechanism consisting of a combination of 
pawls (42) and pawl receiving portions (38) formed on 

the upper and lower casings, respectively. Fin 
portions (350, 551, 629) are formed on the whole area 

or the area except for the fan motor and the blades to 
increase a heat dissipating efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat sink fan, 
and more particularly to a heat sink fan mounted on an 
electric component or an electric instrument such as an 
integrated circuit, for heating the same. A small heat sink fan is widely used for cooling 
an instrument which houses many electric parts, such as 
an OA instrument, a medical instrument or an 
experimental instrument. In Figs. 1 and 2 is shown a 
small heat sink fan used as a heat generation 
preventing apparatus. As shown in these figures, a 
heat sink fan 1 is of an axial type and comprises an 
upper casing 2 having a rectangular shape as viewed 
from above, a lower casing or a heat sink 3 having a 
rectangular shape as viewed from above, and a fan motor 
1A including a propeller-shaped impeller 4 and others. The upper and lower casings 2 and 3 define a space 
in which the fan motor 1A rotates. A plurality of 
vents 5 for passing air are formed in the outer casing 
2. Integral connection portions 7 each having a blind 
end are formed on the four corners of the outer casing 
2 (Fig. 2). The lower casing 3 forming a heat sink 
comprises a blind bottom portion or a bottom portion 8 
formed with a punched window of a circular shape or any 
other shape (not shown), heat dissipating fins 9 rising 
from the side edges of the bottom 8 and connecting 
portions 11 provided with projections 10 received in 
the respective blind holes 6 of the upper casing 2 and 
formed on the four corners of the lower casing 3. The impeller 4 is provided with a cup-shaped 
rotating member 12, and a plurality of blades 13 
projecting radially outward from the outer periphery of 
the cup-shaped rotating member 12. A rotary shaft 14 
is rotatably supported in a cylindrical central inner 
sleeve of the upper casing 2 by means of bearings 15,  
 
and the lower end of the rotary shaft 14 is fitted in a 
central through hole of the cup-shaped rotating member 
12. A rotor magnet 16 is fixed to the inner periphery 
of the cup-shaped rotating member 12 by means of a yoke 
12a. The cup-shaped rotating member 12, the yoke 12a 
and the rotator magnet 16 constitute a rotor 17. On 
the inner boss of the outer casing 2 is mounted a 
stator 18 comprising a stator core having a plurality 
of teeth arranged circumferentially of the inner boss, 
and a coil wound around the teeth. One casing must be disposed just over the other 
casing and fixed to the other casing by holding them in 
parallel and by adjusting them. Thus, the assembly 
requires special attention and skill. When an
