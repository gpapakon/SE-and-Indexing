<ABSTRACT>
Provides an apparatus for obtaining images of 
cornea endothelium, which is capable of detecting an 

optimum imaging position by virtue of its ability of 
reliably detecting endothelium reflected light 

substantially weaker than epithelium reflected light when 
an eyeball surface is illuminated through a slit and the 

resulting cornea reflected light is used to obtain a 
focusing, in order that a magnified image of cornea 

endothelium cells of a subject eye is obtained. Also 
provides an apparatus for obtaining images of cornea cells, 

which is capable of not only detecting epithelium 
reflection with high accuracy but also measuring cornea 

thickness with simplicity and reliability. An endothelium-focusing 
detection use receiving optics 18₁ is set in such 

a position as to receive cornea reflected light of the slit 
light on an optical axis 14₁ that passes an objective lens 

15 when an eyeball surface 2 is illuminated through a slit 
and an endothelium image of a subject part is formed in a 

focused state on an image receiving surface 22 of a TV 
camera 23 via a magnification-imaging optical system based 

on the illumination light. An epithelium-focusing 
detection use receiving optics 18₂ is set on an optical 

axis 14₂ branched from the optical axis 14₁ of the 
magnification-imaging optical system. For detection of the  

 
state how the slit light is received by the receiving 

optics 18₁, for example, a slit aperture 17 forward of the 
receiving optics or a detection-use slit aperture 7 in 

front of an illumination lamp 4 is used so that cornea 
endothelium reflected light can be detected with 

reliability. The receiving optics 18₁, 18₂ are provided by 
those optimum for their respective applications. In the 

case where cornea thickness is to be calculated, the cornea 
thickness is calculated in correspondence to an epithelium-reflected-light 

received position on the receiving optics 
18₂ such as a line sensor at the time when endothelium 

reflected light has been detected by the receiving optics 
18₁.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
obtaining images of cornea endothelium, by which images of
cornea endothelium cells of an eyeball of a subject person
can be observed or photographed under magnification. More
specifically, the invention relates to an apparatus for
obtaining images of cornea endothelium, which apparatus is
capable of detecting a cornea endothelium focused position
by detecting weak cornea-endothelium reflected light with
high accuracy and reliability, and also relates to an
apparatus for obtaining images of cornea endothelium, which
apparatus is capable of measuring cornea thickness with
high accuracy by detecting epithelium reflected light with
high accuracy.For seeing influences of contact lenses or for
medical examination and treatment before and after an
operation of cataract, it is necessary to observe the state
of cornea endothelium cells. Therefore, for observing or
photographing under magnification cornea endothelium cells
of an eyeball of a subject person, there have 
conventionally been used apparatus in which with an
objective lens of a microscope of non-contact type or
contact type with respect to the eyeball surface of the
subject person, slit illumination light is applied toward
an observation part obliquely of the eye axis, and its
reflected light from the cornea is magnified, in which
state the cornea endothelium cells can be observed, or in
which apparatus an optimum imaging position where a TV
camera or the like is focused on cornea endothelium is
detected by the principle of the so-called triangulation
method by detecting the position of the reflected light of
the slit illumination light from the cornea endothelium, in
which state the cornea endothelium cells of the subject
part can be imaged by the TV camera or the like.To solve these inconveniences in operation of the
conventional apparatus, the present applicant has
previously proposed an apparatus which is capable of
automatically observing or photographing under
magnification images of cornea endothelium cells of a
subject part and moreover which is capable of measuring
cornea thickness of the subject eye besides the observation
and photographing under magnification, in Japanese Patent
Application No. HEI 05-166132, filed June 10, 1993. In
this apparatus, for measurement of cornea thickness, one
light receiving element has been used to detect two rays of 
reflected light from cornea epithelium and cornea endothelium. However, in these conventional apparatus the focusing on the
cornea endothelium
