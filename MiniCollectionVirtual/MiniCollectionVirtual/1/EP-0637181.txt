<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radio system with frequency optimisation, especially a mobile radio system with radio base stations and subscribers (mobile stations or stationary stations) at low speed down to standstill. To avoid fluctuations and interruptions in the received level, the invention provides that in each subscriber station (mobile station or stationary station), the received levels and/or transmission quality of all frequencies or channels or of some of the frequencies or channels of the channels available to a radio base station are continuously measured and the measurement values are transmitted to the radio base stations, in which, from the total information, the frequencies or channels are allocated to the subscribers in such a manner that a most optimum frequency or transmission quality possible is allocated to each connection.

<CLAIMS>
Radio system

having fixed radio stations and subscriber
stations travelling at slow speeds down to zero,

having means, associated with a subscriber
station, for measuring the transmission quality of

at least one part of a fixed radio station, in
whose radio cell the subscriber station is

located,

having means at the network end for allocation of
channels so that a channel having a transmission

quality which is as optimum as possible is
allocated for each of the connections,
characterized by
 -

means, associated with the subscriber station, for
cyclic transmission of the measured values to the

fixed radio station,

the means at the network end being configured for
allocation of channels such that, from all the

information of the measured value transmitted to
the fixed radio station, one of its channels is

allocated to the subscriber station.
Radio system according to Claim 1,
characterized by

modulation means for use of multistage phase
modulation for the transmission. 
Radio system according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized by

transmission means for transmitting symbols which,
before the evaluation process, provide time for

the stabilization of the transmission channel.
Radio system according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized by

receiving means which use an FFT for simultaneous
evaluation of all the channels of interest.
Radio system according to one of the preceding
claims,
characterized by

means for arranging a number of channels at one
frequency by means of a time-division duplex

method.
Radio system according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized by

means for separating the transmission directions
between the fixed radio station and the subscriber

station by means of a frequency-division duplex
method.
