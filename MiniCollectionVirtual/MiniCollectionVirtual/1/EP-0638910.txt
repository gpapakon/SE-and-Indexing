 is calcined, an oxide hydroxide of a
dopant is added to an aqueous solution of the calcined

oxide mixture in the molar quantity x, and then
pressure compaction of the materials system is carried

out.
Process according to Claim 3, in which thermistor
tablets are produced from the materials system by

pressure forming, and the tablets are sintered at a
temperature in the region of 1550Â°C.
