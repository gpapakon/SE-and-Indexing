<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to synthetic quartz 
glass powder suitable for use as a raw material for ultra-high 
purity quartz glass products used in the field of 
semiconductor production, a process for producing such 
synthetic quartz glass powder, and to a semiconductor comprising 
such synthetic quartz glass powder. Crucibles used for producing semiconductor single 
crystals and jigs have been manufactured by powdering 
natural quartz and fusing the powder. Since natural 
quartz, even a high quality one, contains various metallic 
impurities, it does not have satisfactory 
purity. If metallic impurities contaminate high-purity 
single crystals, whose importance and demand are increasing 
with the recent trend toward higher performance in the 
semiconductor industries, the performance of the 
semiconductors produced therefrom is adversely affected to 
a considerable degree, so that it is impossible to use the 
crucibles or jigs which have the possibility of 
contamination by metallic impurities. Thus, a high-purity 
quartz glass powder produced by synthesis has been 
demanded. Recently, quartz glass produced by the sol-gel method 
in which an alkoxysilane is used as a raw material has been 
proposed as a high-purity silicate source. For instance, 
JP-A-62-176928  
 
(1987) discloses a method for producing a quartz (silica) 
glass powder by hydrolyzing an alkoxysilane at a specified pH 
to prepare a gel, powdering the gel, and after drying, 
calcining the powder. However, when using the obtained quartz glass 
powder as a raw material for glass products for 
semiconductors, a certain degree of fluidity is required 
for the transport of the powder. Also, when the quartz 
glass powder is fused and molded, a loss of volume 
inevitably takes place. It is desirable that the 
volumetric loss be minimized, and that the packing density 
thereof be close as possible to that of the conventionally used natural 
quartz powder. However, natural quartz powder 
is crystalline (α-quartz) and its theoretical density is 2.6 
g/cm3, whereas synthetic quartz glass powder is amorphous 
and its theoretical density is only 2.2 g/cm3, so that, naturally, 
the packing bulk density of synthetic quartz glass powder 
is lower than that of natural quartz powder if the shapes 
and particle sizes of both powders are the same. Therefore, 
there has been difficult in preparing a synthetic quartz 
glass powder having an appropriate packing density. It has now been found that by agitating the dry silica gel powder 
produced by the
