<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an acetabular cup for insertion into bone tissue, comprising an outer metal cup (1) and an inner sliding cup (2), the bearing surface (3) of the sliding cup (2) in the metal cup (1) being conical. In order to protect the sliding cup (2) against twisting and falling out, while it can nevertheless be pushed out of its seat and exchanged without being irreparably damaged, it is provided, according to the invention, that the sliding cup (2) rest upon the conical bearing surface (3) without automatic locking, and that the sliding cup (2) be fixed in the metal cup (1) via a retention ring (4).

Hip-joint socket for insertion in osseous
tissue, comprising an outer metal shell (1) and an

inner sliding shell (2) made of ceramics, wherein the
bearing surface (3) of the sliding shell (2) in the

metal shell (1) is conical in form, the sliding shell
(2) rests without self-locking on the conical bearing

surface (3) and is fixed in the metal shell (1) by way
of a retaining ring (4), the retaining ring (4) is

fastened on the end face of the metal shell (1) by
means of screws (5) and extends beyond the inside edge

of the metal shell (1), and, beneath the conical
bearing surface (3), between the sliding shell (2) and

the base (9) of the metal shell (1), is a clearance.
Hip-joint socket for insertion in osseous
tissue, comprising an outer metal shell (1) and an

inner sliding shell (2) made of ceramics, wherein the
bearing surface (3) of the sliding shell (2) in the

metal shell (1) is conical in form, the sliding shell
(2) rests without self-locking on the conical bearing

surface (3) and is fixed in the metal shell (1) by way
of a retaining ring (4), the upper outer edge of the

sliding shell (2) has an inwardly directed conical
slope (6) and the sliding shell (2) is anchored in the

metal shell by way of a clamping ring (7) as retaining
ring that rests on the conical slope (6), and, beneath

the conical bearing surface (3), between the sliding
shell (2) and the base (9) of the metal shell (1), is a

clearance.

to 5, characterised in that the clamping ring (7) is

screwed into the metal shell (1) by way of a thread
(8).
Hip-joint socket according to one of claims 2
to 6, characterised in that the clamping ring (7) has

bores and is fixed in the metal shell (1) by way of
screws (5).
