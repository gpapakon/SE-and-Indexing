<ABSTRACT>
An autocalibration system includes two loudspeakers (2, 4) spaced from three 
microphones (16, 18, 20). Acoustic transient pulses are emitted by each loudspeaker (2, 4) 

in turn and from the reception of of these pulses by each of the microphones (16, 18, 20), the 
time-of-flight for each pulse to each microphone may be derived. From these time-of-flight 

measurements are also derived the distance and angular displacement of each microphone (16, 
18, 20) from a reference point (12) flanked by the loudspeakers (2, 4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for determination of position
and has particular, although not exclusive, relevance to use in so-called
dummy-head recording
techniques.An example of a dummy-head recording system is disclosed in United States Patent US-A-4,119,798.
In this document a dummy-head having microphones mounted in the ear canals
thereof is used for multi-channel stereophonic sound recording. An acoustic cross-talk
cancellation circuit is arranged to receive the microphone signals thereby to provide a binaural
effect when reproduced through loudspeakers.There are circumstances, though, in which the use of further microphones remote from
the dummy-head may he used as part of the recording process to provide a binaural effect. In
such a situation it is necessary to know accurately the position of each remote microphone
relative to the dummy head.There exist a variety of methods by which this position may be measured, such as using
polar coordinates by utilising a theodolite and an optical range finder. Alternatively the
Cartesian coordinates of the remote microphones and dummy head could be measured with
respect to the boundaries of the room in which the recording is to take place, and then the
azimuth angle, depression/elevation angle and the time-of-flight distance between the dummy-head
and each remote microphone could be calculated.However such methods of measurement suffer from various shortcomings including the
fact that distance measurements take a considerable time to carry out and are often very
disruptive in a recording environment, especially if the remote microphones are deliberately
moved to a different location during a recording session. Also the calculations based upon the 
measurements made are prone to cumulative errors, particularly for extreme positions where the
angles subtended may be very small.Furthermore remote microphones may be physically difficult to access for measurement
purposes due to being suspended several meters from the ground above an orchestra, for
example.Another problem exists due to the fact that the time-of-flight between the remote
microphones and the dummy-had is dependent on the speed of sound in air, which is itself
dependent on both air temperature and humidity.JP-A-62 108 171 discloses a method of accurately calibrating the relative locations of a
pair of echo sound receivers using a plurality of echo sound sources whose position is known
from survey data. Information on sound source azimuth is known and is input as part of

A method of determining the position of a receiver (16) relative to a given reference
point (12) comprising:


a) transmitting acoustic signals from each of a plurality of acoustic signal generators (2,
4);
b) receiving transmitted acoustic signals at the receiver;
c) measuring the time-of-flight of the signals from each acoustic signal generator to the
receiver; and,
d) geometrically determining, from the time-of-flight measurements and the position of
the given reference point relative to each acoustic signal generator, the distance and

angular disposition of the receiver (16) relative to the given reference point,

characterized in that the angular disposition of the receiver (16) is also determined
geometrically from the time of flight measurements, and that the position of each

receiver relative to said reference point is determined independently of the position of
any other(s).
A method according to Claim 1 wherein the acoustic signals transmitted from each of
the acoustic signal generators are transient pulses.
A method according to either Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein acoustic signals are
transmitted from each of the plurality of signal generators in turn.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims including a plurality of acoustic
receivers (16, 18, 20).
A method according to Claim 4 wherein each of the receivers, after receiving the first of 
any signals transmitted by any given signal generator, does not register any subsequent

signals received from the same signal generator until each of the plurality of signal
generators has transmitted their signals.
Apparatus for determining the position of a receiver (16) relative to a given reference
point (12) according to Claim 1, comprising: a plurality of acoustic signal generators (2,

4) for transmitting acoustic signals therefrom; an acoustic signal receiver (16) for
receiving the transmitted acoustic signals; and a signal processor (30) for measuring the

time-of-flight of the acoustic signals from each acoustic signal generator to the receiver
and geometrically determining, from the time-of-flight measurements and the position of

the given reference point relative to each acoustic signal generator, the distance and

the acoustic signal generators are transient pulses.

Apparatus according to Claim 8 wherein the receivers are microphones.
Apparatus according to any one of Claims 6-9 wherein the acoustic signal generators are
loudspeakers.
