<ABSTRACT>
A tactile simulator has an array of actuators (1), with each actuator including a linear motor, the movable thrust rod (6) of which carries a force sensor (5). The position of each thrust rod (6) is sensed by a corresponding position sensor (8). Each actuator (1) also includes a corresponding controller (12) which drives the motor in dependence upon signals from the force sensor (5) and the position sensor (8). An array controller (13) controls the individual element controllers (12) in order to drive the thrust rods (6). The simulator can be used in a display mode, in which the thrust rods (6) are driven to occupy positions corresponding to a surface stored in a database, or in a scan mode, in which the thrust rods (6) are driven into contact with a surface to be registered or recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for scanning a surface or displaying a scanned surface.US-A-4 680 523 discloses a robotic gripping apparatus having a pair of movable fingers,
each provided with position sensors and force sensors. The sensors generate output signals
which are processed in a controller which regulates the operation of the fingers so as to
achieve the desired movements and gripping forces. US-A-3 226 833 discloses a similar
apparatus but used for automatic inspection.According to the invention the device comprises an array of actuators with each actuator
comprising:
(a) a linearly movable member with an operable element,(b) a motor for driving the movable member, (c) a position sensor for generating a first output signal representative of the position of
the movable member, (d) a force sensor for generating a second output signal representative of the force
applied to the operable element in the direction of movement of the movable member, and (e) a controller for driving the motor in dependence on the first and second output
signals, 
the device further comprising:
control means responsive to the first and second output signals in order to control the motors
so that in a scanning mode of the device the first and second signals represent the shape and
resilience of a surface being scanned and in a display mode of the device the elements are
representative of the shape and resilience of the surface to be displayed, in accordance with
the first and second signals supplied to the control means.Preferably, the motors are electrically driven linear motors having thrust rods guided for
movement in parallel directions, and in a preferred embodiment the array is a rectangular
array with mutually perpendicular length and width axes both of which are orthogonal to
the direction of movement of the thrust rods.A simulator according to the invention may operate in a display mode in which
information from a local or remote database drives the control means to cause the operable
elements to occupy positions determined by the information stored in the database. The
array of operable elements thus occupy positions which correspond to a surface stored in
the database. Moreover, the deformability of each operable element, i.e. its stiffness or
resistance to movement, is also representative of the stored surface so that an observer
putting his fingers on the operable elements feels the shape and resilience of the surface
stored in the database. The information from the database may be time-varying, so that
