<ABSTRACT>
The bits sent are coded according to the product of at least two codes in systematic blocs. An iteratif decoding is applied to determine, at each step of searching for code words, a data matrix and a decision matrix which are used for the following step. The new decision matrix is determined at each step by decoding the rows or the columns of the input matrix, and the new data matrix is determined by taking account of the correction terms which increase the reliability of the decoding at each iteration. Used particularly for high-efficiency block codes.

including a number m of decoding cycles, each decoding cycle

successively including code word search steps (32, 33) for
each elementary block code used in the product code,

characterized in that, at each code word search step (32,
33), a data matrix ({R'}) with multiple-valued components

and a decision matrix ({D}) with binary components are
received which, before the first search step of the

iterative decoding phase consist respectively of an input
matrix ({R}) consisting of samples of the received signal

(R(t)) and of a matrix, the components of which are those of
the input matrix ({R}) put into binary form, and a new

decision matrix ((D)) and a new data matrix ({R'}) are
produced for the following search step, in that the decoded

information bits (â
j

produced during the last code word search step, and in that

each code word search step (32, 33) includes a division of
the data matrix received into data vectors ([R']
