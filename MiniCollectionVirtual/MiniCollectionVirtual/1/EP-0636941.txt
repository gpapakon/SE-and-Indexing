<ABSTRACT>
A deep ultraviolet absorbent comprising at 
least one compound having one or more glycidyl groups in 

the molecule and at least one anthracene derivative, and 
a solvent capable of dissolving these compounds is 

effective for preventing reflection of deep ultraviolet 
light from a substrate during formation of resist 

pattern, resulting in forming ultra-fine patterns 
without causing notching and halation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
forming resist patterns in production of semiconductor 
devices. More particularly, the invention pertains to a 
deep ultraviolet absorbent used for eliminating or 
minimizing influence of reflected light from the 
substrate when forming a resist pattern on a 
semiconductor substrate by lithography using deep 
ultraviolet light, and a pattern forming method using 
such a deep ultraviolet absorbent. With a recent trend toward high-density 
integration of semiconductor devices, there has been 
rising call for shortening of wavelength of the energy 
source of exposure methods used for fine working, 
particularly photolithography, and now use of deep 
ultraviolet light (300 nm or less in wavelength), KrF 
excimer laser light (248.4 nm), ArF excimer laser light 
(193 nm), electron beams and soft X-rays is seriously 
considered. Higher sensitivity and higher resolution of 
resist material has been required in use of such energy 
source, and as an answer to such request, a chemically 
amplified resist material using an acid generated by 
exposure as medium has been proposed [H. Ito et al: 
Polym. Eng. Sci., Vol. 23, p. 1012, 1983]. Since then, 
significant advancements have been made, with many  
 
reports published, on the chemically amplified resist 
material, and at present there is available a resist 
material having a resolving capability on the order of 
0.25-0.30 µm. Generally, use of a chemically amplified 
resist on a flat silicon substrate provides a good 
resist pattern with a rectangular sectional shape. 
However, poly(hydroxystyrene) popularly used as base 
resin for the chemically amplified resist is highly 
transparent to deep ultraviolet light such as KrF 
excimer laser light, so that it is highly susceptible to 
intra-film multiple reflection of deep ultraviolet light 
such as excimer laser light from the semiconductor 
substrate. The resist film is varied in thickness under 
the influence of this intra-film multiple reflection, 
consequently causing a substantial change of resist 
pattern dimensions. Especially when the semiconductor 
substrate is nonuniform in thickness or in the case of a 
highly reflective substrate such as aluminum substrate, 
variation of the resist film thickness is large and also 
intra-film multiple reflection is intensified, giving 
rise to a problem of excessive variation of resist 
pattern dimensions or disconnection of the substrate. Use of an organic anti-reflective film has 
been proposed as a measure against
