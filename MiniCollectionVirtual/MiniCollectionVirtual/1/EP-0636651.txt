<ABSTRACT>
Organic polymers or copolymers containing pendant, optionally protected carbonyl groups and pendant, optionally protected diol groups in the same polymer molecule or in different polymer molecules are crosslinked in the presence of acidic catalysts with formation of 1,3-dioxane or 1,3-dioxolane groups. Similar crosslinking bridges can be formed from said pendant groups with the corresponding coreactive groups of a low-molecular-weight crosslinking agent.

Crosslinked polymer obtainable by intermolecular
crosslinking between polymer molecule chains, with the

formation of 1,3-dioxan or 1,3-dioxolan groups,
consisting of ethylenically unsaturated, radically

polymerisable monomers and monomers with lateral,
optionally protected carbonyl groups and/or monomers

with lateral, optionally protected 1,2- or 1,3-diol
groups, optionally using low molecular, at least

difunctional crosslinking agents, the crosslinked
polymer arising from the crosslinking of a polymer

wherein the lateral carbonyl group and the lateral diol
group are components of the same polymer or may consist

of a mixture of polymers of different compositions,
characterised in that the monomers with lateral,

optionally protected 1,2- or 1,3-diol groups used are
esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid of the structure

or


and the monomers with lateral, optionally protected
carbonyl groups used are ethylenically unsaturated,

radically polymerisable monomers with carbonyl groups of
the structure 


CH

wherein R is a hydrogen atom or an optionally
substituted hydrocarbon group, B is a divalent organic

group and R' denotes lower alkyl groups or, taken
together, an alkylene group and the proportions of the

unsaturated monomers with diol and with carbonyl side
chains each constitute about 1 to 20% by weight, based

on the weight of the polymer.
Crosslinked polymer according to claim 1,

optionally protected aldehyde groups.

characterised in that the carbonyl groups are used as

dialkyl acetals or as dioxolanes.
Crosslinked polymer according to one or more of
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the carbonyl group

is bound to the polymer via an aliphatic group.
Use of the crosslinked polymers or polymer mixtures
according to one or more of claims 1 to 4 for preparing

coating layers on substrates.

according to one or more of claims 1 to 4 for preparing

adhesives on substrates.
Use of the crosslinked polymers or polymer mixtures
