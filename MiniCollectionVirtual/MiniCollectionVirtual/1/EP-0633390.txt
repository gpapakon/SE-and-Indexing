<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention broadly relates to hydraulic
cement compositions and methods of their use, and more
specifically, to additives for retarding the set of
hydraulic cement compositions.In the construction and repair of wells, such as
oil, gas and water wells, various operations featuring the
use of hydraulic cement compositions are performed. For
example, in the completion of a well comprised of a well
bore which penetrates one or more subterranean formations, a
pipe, such as casing, is disposed in the well bore and a
hydraulic cement composition is placed in the annular space
between the walls of the well bore and the exterior of the
pipe. The cement composition is permitted to set in the
annular space whereby a cement sheath is formed therein
which bonds the pipe to the walls of the well bore and
prevents the undesirable flow of fluids into and through the
annular space. Formation of the cement sheath is referred
to herein as primary cementing.In repairing wells, hydraulic cement compositions
are often utilized to plug holes or cracks in pipe disposed
in the 
well bore; to plug holes, cracks, voids or channels in the aforementioned cement
sheath; and to plug permeable zones or fractures in subterranean formations. Such
holes, cracks, voids, channels, and permeable zones are plugged by squeezing
hydraulic cement compositions therein which harden and form impermeable plugs.
The above procedures are referred to herein as remedial cementing.A number of additives have been hitherto employed in prior art
cementing compositions, such as dispersants, fluid loss additives or the like. For
example, WO-A-91 16522 discloses dispersants suitable for use in cement slurries and
mixtures of drilling fluids and cement slurries. The dispersants can be selected
from the following - hydroxypropyl acrylate-acrylic acid copolymer; sulfonated
vinyl toluene - maleic anhydride copolymer; sulfonated vinyl toluene - maleic acid
copolymer; sulfonated methyl polyacrylamide; sulfonated ethyl polyacrylamide;
sulfonated phenyl polyacrylamide; a copolymer of ethylenic acids, acrylamides
and ethylenic esters of phosphonic acid; acrylic acid polymers; acrylamide
polymers; sulfonated copolymers of acrylic acid and acrylamide; phosphonated
copolymers of acrylic acid and acrylamide; and sulfonated and phosphonated
copolymers of acrylic acid and acrylamide.US-A-4674574 discloses a cementing composition comprising water,
hydraulic cement and a water dispersible fluid loss additive. The fluid loss
additive comprises a terpolymer of a
