<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel N-sulfonyloxyimide
compound suitable as a radiation-sensitive acid-generating
agent component of radiation-sensitive resin compositions used
as chemically amplified resists suited for fine processing made
by various radiations such as ultraviolet radiations,
far-ultraviolet radiations, X-raditions and charged particles.
It also relates to chemically amplified positive and negative
radiation-sensitive resin compositions making use of such an
N-sulfonyloxyimide compound.In the field of fine processing as typified by the
fabrication of integrated-circuit devices, the size of
processing in lithography is being made finer in order to
achieve a higher degree of integration. In recent years,
lithographic processes that enables stable fine processing in
a size of 0.5µm or finer is powerfully being developed.However, in conventional processes making use of visible
radiations (wavelength: 400 to 700 nm) or near ultraviolet 
radiations (300 to 400 nm), it is difficult to form such fine
patterns in a high precision. Accordingly, proposed are
lithographic processes that can achieve a wider focal depth
and make use of radiations having a short wavelength
(wavelength: 300 nm or shorter) effective for making design
rules finer.Radiations having such a short wavelength may include,
e.g., far-ultraviolet radiations of KrF excimer lasers
(wavelength: 248 nm) or ArF excimer lasers (wavelength: 193
nm), X-radiations such as synchrotron radiations, and
charged-particle radiations such as electron radiations.
Then, as a high-resolution resist adaptable to these
short-wavelength radiations, "chemically amplified resist
resist" is proposed by International Business Machine (IBM)
Corp. At present, improvements of this chemically amplified
resist are being energetically made.Chemically amplified resists are resists with which a
resist pattern is formed by generating an acid by irradiation
with radiations (hereinafter "exposure") to a
radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent contained therein
to cause a chemical change (e.g., change in polarity,
destruction of chemical bonds, or cross-linking reaction) in
resist film by the catalytic action of this acid and utilize
a phenomenon that the solubility to a developing solution
changes at the exposed areas.In such chemically amplified resists, the
radiation-sensitive acid-generating agent is known to have a
great influence on the function as a resist, and is commonly
grouped into an ionic one and a nonionic one.
