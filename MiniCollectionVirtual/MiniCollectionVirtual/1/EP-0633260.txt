<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is concerned with compounds having 5-HT1A 
antagonistic activity useful in treating CNS disorders and having formula 2 


wherein 

R‚ÇÅ
 is halogen, lower alkyl or alkoxy, hydroxy, trifluotomethyl or cyano, 
m
 has the value 1 or 2 and 
n
 has the value 
0
 or 
1
, 
A
 represents an alkylene chain containing 2-6 C-atoms which may be 
substituted with one or more lower alkyl groups or a monocyclic 

(hetero)aryl group, and 
B
 is methylene, ethylene, carbonyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl or sulfur, 
 
and salts thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a group of new 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-yl-piperazine
derivatives with interesting pharmacological. properties, to the preparation of these
compounds and to compositions containing at least one of these compounds or a
salt thereof as an active component.European patent No. 0190472 relates to compounds of the formula (1)

wherein Z together with the phenyl group preferably represents an optionally
substituted benzofuranyl group or benzodioxolyl group, and D may represent an
alkyl chain optionally substituted with a phenyl group, hetero-aryl group or
heterocyclic group.It is described that these compounds have interesting psychotropic properties, and
more particularly have anti-psychotic properties.Is has now been found that compounds of the formula (2)
whereinR1 is halogen, methyl, methoxy, hydroxy, trifluoromethyl or cyano,m has the value 1 or 2, R2 is hydrogen or chlorine,A represents an alkylene chain containing 2-6 C-atoms which may be
substituted with a phenyl group, andB is methylene, ethylene, carbonyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl or sulfur
and salts thereof have a selective 5-HT1A-antagonistic activity.Lower alkyl and alkoxy groups are groups having 1-4 C-atoms which chains may be
straight or branched.Suitable acids with which the compounds of formula (2) can form pharmaceutically
acceptable acid addition salts are for example hydrochloric acid, sulfunic acid,
phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and organic acids such as citric acid, fumaric acid,
maleic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid,
methanesulfonic acid and naphtalenesulfonic acid.When alkylene chain A is substituted a centre of chirality is present in the
compounds. The invention both relates to racemic compounds and individual
enantiomers.It has surprisingly been found that these new piperazine derivative of formula (2)
and their salts are selective 5-HT1A-antagonists which can be used for the
treatment of central nervous system (CNS)-disorders in which the serotonergic
transmission is disturbed, for example anxiety disorders, depression, psychosis,
loss of memory, sleep disturbances, feeding behaviour and sexual dysfunction.The compounds were tested for their ability to displace [3H]-2-(di-n-propylamino)-8-hydroxytetralin([3H]-8-OH-DPAT)
from its specific binding sites in rat frontal cortex
homogenates. This test is based on the method described by Gozlan et al. (Nature,
305, (1983), pages 140-142). In general the compounds bind to the 5-HT 1A-receptors
in a considerable greater extent
