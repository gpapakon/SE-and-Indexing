<ABSTRACT>
A method of preventing miscarriage in a female by administering to the female a therapeutically effective amount of an active substance selected from the group consisting of PP14, derivatives of PP14, muteins of PP14, fragments of PP14, and subunits of PP14, so as to prevent miscarriage. A method of testing a female for the possibility of future miscarriage by measuring the level of PP14 in the female, and comparing the measured level to the level of PP14 present in normal fertile women. A method of improving the efficacy of assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination, in-vitro fertilization, or gamete intra-fallopian transfer, by adding an effective amount of PP14 to a sample comprising an embryo, fertilized or unfertilized egg, mixture of eggs and sperm, or sperm alone, prior to, concurrently with, or following introduction of the sample into the patient.

 METHOD OF TREATING RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE ANDIMPROVING THE EFFICACY OF ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVETECHNIQUES USING PLACENTAL PROTEIN 14BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION ^ 1 • Field of the Invention:The present invention relates to inhibitors of immune cell proliferation and function, and more particularly to the use of Placental Protein 14 (PP14) to treat recurrent miscarriage. The invention also relates to methods for 10 improving the efficacy of assisted reproductive techniques, using PP14. 2. Background of the Invention:The human immune system functions to protect the organism from infection and from foreign antigens by15 cellular and humoral mechanisms. The immune system consists of a complex organization of many types of lymphocytes, and macrophage or other antigen-presenting cells . These agents regulate each other by means of multiple cell-cell interactions and by elaborating soluble20 factors, including lymphokines and antibodies, that have autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine effects on immune cells. Disorders of the regulation of this system may result in the uncontrolled proliferation of immune cellsV and eventually to malignancy, uncontrolled response to25 foreign antigens or organisms leading to allergic or1SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 inflammatory diseases, aberrant immune responses directed against host cells leading to organ damage and dysfunction, or generalized suppression of the immune response leading to severe and recurrent infections. Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is a peptide cytokine secreted by a variety of cell types including accessory cells of the immune system, and the antigen presenting cells. Interleukin 1 has a variety of functions including an involvement in the activation of immune system T-cells. Cells secreting IL-1 include monocytes present in the circulating blood, macrophages found in interstitial fluid, and dendritic cells.It now appears established that IL-1 is a central mediator of inflammatory reactions and is important in pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases, of which rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one example. Evidence of this function of IL-1 has been derived from a variety of experimental approaches and may be summarized as follows:1. Prostaglandins and leukotrienes are mediators of inflammatory reactions; hence non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, which inhibit cyclooxygenase and prostaglandin synthesis, are useful therapeutically in such conditions. IL-1 mobilizes free arachidonate, the precursor of prostaglandins and leucotrienes, by activating phospholipase, and also
