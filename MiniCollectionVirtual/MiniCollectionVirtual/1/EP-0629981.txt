<ABSTRACT>
A selective calling receiver includes a 
selective calling receiver main body, a chain clip, a 

detection circuit, and a control circuit. 
The selective calling receiver main body has a 

notification unit for calling and drives the 
notification unit a numerical signal is received to 

perform a notifying operation. The chain clip entirely 
consists of a conductive metal and has one end connected 

to the selective calling receiver main body and the 
other end connected to a clip. The detection circuit is 

arranged in the selective calling receiver main body and 
electrically connected to the chain clip to detect that 

a user touches a portion of the chain clip with his/her 
hand. The control circuit is arranged in the selective 

calling receiver main body and stops the notifying 
operation of the notification unit when an output is 

generated by the detection circuit in a notification 
enable state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a selective
calling receiver and, more particularly, to a selective
calling receiver having a chain clip fastened to the
clothes of a user to prevent the selective calling
receiver from being removed from the clothes.In recent years, selective calling receivers,
each of which is a so-called a "pocket bell", always
carried by a person, and called by a numerical signal in
an emergency state or the like, have been popularly
used. Some selective calling receiver generates a
buzzer sound to notify a call, some selective calling
receiver itself is vibrated to notify a call, and some
selective calling receiver has both the notification
modes. In addition, some selective calling receiver
automatically stops a notifying operation a
predetermined period of time after a notifying operation
is started. However, when the selective calling
receiver which automatically stops a notifying operation
a predetermined period of time after a notifying
operation is started is used, the notifying operation
may be stopped before a user notices a call. For this 
reason, a selective calling receiver which stops a
notifying operation by a manual switching operation
performed by a user is popularly used.Fig. 6 shows a conventional selective calling
receiver. This conventional selective calling receiver
comprises a reception antenna 11 for receiving a
numerical signal; a receiver 12 for demodulating the
received numerical signal; a signal decoder 13 for
checking whether the numerical signal is a numerical
signal for calling the self selective calling receiver
and outputting the received call signal to a signal
processing unit when the numerical signal is a numerical
signal for calling the self selective calling receiver;
an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only
Memory) 15 which stores the predetermined identification
number of the self selective calling receiver; a signal
processing unit 14 for controlling a notifying operation
for displaying a message in the numerical signal from
the signal decoder 13 on a liquid crystal display (not
shown) and calling a user; a manual switch 16 for
stopping this notifying operation and switching a
notification means; a switching detection circuit 17 for
detecting depression of the manual switch 16; a tone
generating circuit 18 for outputting a notification
signal representing that the selective calling receiver
user is called to a loudspeaker under the control of the
signal processing unit 14; a loudspeaker 19 for 
outputting a buzzer sound under the

<CLAIMS>
A selective calling receiver characterized by
comprising:


a selective calling receiver main body (112,
113, 114, 130), having notification means (119, 121) for

calling, for driving said notification means when a
numerical signal is received to perform a notifying

operation;
a chain clip (136) entirely consisting of a
conductive metal and having one end connected to said

selective calling receiver main body and the other end
connected to a clip (136b);
detection means (140), arranged in said
selective calling receiver main body and electrically

connected to said chain clip, for detecting that a user
touches a portion of said chain clip with his/her hand;

and
control means (114a), arranged in said
selective calling receiver main body, for stopping the

notifying operation of said notification means when an
output is generated by said detection means in a

notification enable state.
A selective calling receiver according to
claim 1, wherein said notification means has a plurality

of notification modes having a predetermined order, and 
said control means controls said notification means to

change the notification mode in accordance with the
predetermined order when an output is generated by said

detection means in a notification disable state.
A selective calling receiver according to
claim 2, further comprising a memory (114b) for storing

one of the plurality of notification modes stored in
said notification means and updating and storing a next

notification mode when the output is generated by said
detection means in the notification disable state, and

wherein said control means selects a notification mode
of said notification means in accordance with the

notification mode stored in said memory when a numerical
signal is received.
A selective calling receiver according to
claim 2, wherein said notification means comprises a

sound generating (121) device (119) and a vibration
generating device and selects a sound and a vibration

serving as the plurality of notification modes to
perform a notifying operation.
A selective calling receiver according to
claim 1, further comprising a manual switch (116) for

stopping a notifying operation, and wherein said
notification means has a plurality of notification modes 

having a predetermined switching order, said control
means stops a notifying operation of said notification

means when an output is generated by said manual switch
in a notification enable state, and controls said

notification means when an output is generated by said
manual switch in a notification disable state, thereby

changing a notification mode in accordance with the
predetermined order.
A selective calling receiver according to
claim 1, further comprising logical OR means (117)

having outputs of said detection means and said manual
switch as two inputs, for outputting a logical OR output
