<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a galanthamine derivative, a process for its
preparation and its use as a medicament.WO-A-88 08708 discloses galanthamine derivatives, including 6-O-demethyl-6-O-(dimethylaminocarbonyl)
galanthamine, for the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
and useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.This application provides a compound of the formula

or a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt thereof;
which is useful for inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and alleviating various memory
dysfunctions characterized by decreased cholinergic function such as Alzheimer's
disease.This invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition useful for
inhibiting acetylcholinesterase and alleviating various memory dysfunctions
characterized by decreased cholinergic function which comprises a compound of the
invention in an amount sufficient to affect cholinergic function and a
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Unless otherwise stated or indicated, the following definitions shall apply
throughout the specification and appended claims.The term "alkyl" shall mean a straight or branched alkyl group of the stated
number of carbon atoms. Examples include methyl, ethyl, 
n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, and straight and branched
chain pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and pentadecyl.The compound of the invention is prepared from the appropriate derivative of
galanthamine as described more fully below and shown in Scheme I.
The intermediate 6-demethylgalanthamine of Formula IV, a known
compound, was prepared in a novel process by treating the galanthamine of Formula
III with an alkaline salt of ethanthiol such as, for example, with EtSLi, EtSNa or EtSK.
The reaction is typically carried out in a polar nonprotic solvent such as
dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone or a protic solvent such as butanol
or pentanol at from about 80°C to about 135°C, preferably from about 90°C to about
125°C.The compound of Formula V wherein R4 is hydrogen and R5 is (C1-C12)alkyl is 
prepared by treating the compound of Formula IV with the appropriate isocyanato
compound R5NCO. The reaction is carried out in an aprotic solvent such as, for
example, tetrahydrofuran in the presence of base such as, for example, potassium
carbonate at from about -10°C to about 30°C for from about 0.5 hours to about 4
hours.The compound of Formula I of the present invention can be used for the
treatment of various memory dysfunctions characterized by decreased cholinergic
