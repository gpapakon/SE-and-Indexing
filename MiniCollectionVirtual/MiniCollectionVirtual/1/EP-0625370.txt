<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to silver-containing catalysts suitable 
for the preparation of ethylene oxide and to the use of the 
catalysts for the preparation of ethylene oxide. Catalysts for the production of ethylene oxide from ethylene 
and molecular oxygen are generally supported silver catalysts. Such 
catalysts are typically promoted with alkali metals. The use of 
small amounts of the alkali metals potassium, rubidium and cesium 
were noted as useful promoters in supported silver catalysts in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,962,136 and U.S. Patent No. 4,010,115. The use of 
other co-promoters, such as rhenium, or rhenium along with sulphur, 
molybdenum, tungsten and chromium is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 4,766,105 and U.S. Patent No. 4,808,738. U.S. Patent 
No. 4,908,343 discloses a supported silver catalyst containing a 
mixture of a cesium salt and one or more alkali metal and alkaline 
earth metal salts. U.S. Patent No. 3,836,481 discloses a catalyst combination of 
reduced silver and at least one rare earth metal compound 
distributed on the surface of the reduced silver. U.S. Patent No. 4,257,967 discloses a catalyst combination of 
reduced silver, a carbonate of a rare earth metal and yttrium, a 
salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal and a catalyst carrier. None of these references disclose the use of a promoting amount 
of rare earth which is present on a silver-based, alkali 
metal/rhenium-doped supported catalyst. The present invention relates to an ethylene oxide catalyst for 
the vapour phase production of ethylene oxide from ethylene and 
oxygen comprising a catalytically effective amount of silver, a 
promoting amount of alkali metal, a promoting amount of rhenium and 
optionally a rhenium co-promoter, supported on a suitable support, 
characterized in that the catalyst also contains a rare earth metal 
compound in an amount, expressed as the element, ranging from 10 to 
1000 parts per million by weight of total catalyst.  
 It has been found that catalysts containing a promoting amount 
of rare earth compound have higher selectivity stabilities than 
those obtained with catalysts containing no rare earth compound. Generally, in the vapour phase reaction of ethylene with oxygen 
to produce ethylene oxide, the ethylene is present in at least a 
double amount (on a molar basis) compared with oxygen, but often 
much higher. Therefore, the conversion is calculated according to 
the mole percentage of oxygen which has been consumed in the 
reaction to form ethylene oxide and any oxygenated
