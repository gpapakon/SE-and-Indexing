<ABSTRACT>
A porous polytetrafluoroethylene film which is obtainable by 
biaxially stretching a semisintered polytetrafluoroethylene 

(PTFE) material having a sintering degree 

(ΔH₁-ΔH₃)/(ΔH₁₋ΔH₂) 
 
of 0.30 to 0.80 (wherein ΔH₁ is the heat of fusion of the 

unsintered PTFE material, ΔH₂ is the heat of fusion of the 
sintered PTFE material and ΔH₃ is the heat of fusion of the 

semisintered PTFE material), at an area draw ratio of at 
least 50 and heat setting the stretched film at a temperature 

higher than the melting point of sintered 
polytetrafluoroethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a polytetrafluoroethylene
(hereinafter referred to as "PTFE") porous
film, and a filter comprising
the same. More particularly, the present invention
relates to a process for preparing a novel PTFE porous film useful as an air filter
which is suitable for trapping suspended fine particles in
air or other gases in an clean room to be used in a semiconductor
industry and which causes a small pressure loss of
the air or other gases.As a material of the air filter to be used in the
clean room, a filter material prepared by forming a sheet
from a mixture of glass fibers and a binder is often used.
However, such filter material has some drawbacks, for
example, presence of adhered minute fibers in the filter
material, occurrence of self-dusting during processing or
folding of the filter material, or increase of the pressure
loss caused by an increased amount of the binder to be added
to suppress the self-dusting (cf. Japanese Patent Kokai
Publication No. 16019/1988 and corresponding U.S. Patent No.
4,877,433). In addition, when such filter material is contacted 
with a certain chemical such as hydrofluoric acid, it
makes dust due to deterioration of the glass and the binder.To solve such drawbacks, an electret filter material
made of a synthetic fiber is proposed in Japanese
Patent Kokai Publication No. 53365/1979, but it suffers from
deterioration of the electret.To overcome the above defects, it is proposed to
use a stretched porous film of PTFE as an auxiliary member
for the filter material (cf. Japanese Patent Kokai Publication
Nos. 16019/1988 and 284614/1990).However, this proposal uses a porous PTFE film
having a pore size of 1 µm or larger to prevent increase of
the pressure loss.A theoretical reason for that the suspended particles
having a particle size smaller than the above pore size
can be trapped may be as follows:There are following three mechanisms for removing
the particles from a fluid by the filter (cf. a brochure of
Domnick Hunter Filters Limited).Comparatively large particles are intercepted by
microfibers of the filter material and removed as if they
are sieved.When the particles pass through winding spaces
among the microfibers, they cannot change their moving directions 
as quick as the gas so that they collide against the
microfibers and adhere thereto.Motion of very small particles is controlled by
intermolecular forces or static electricity and they spirally
move in the gas, so that their apparent diameters are
increased and
