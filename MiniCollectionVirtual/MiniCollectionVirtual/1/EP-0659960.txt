<ABSTRACT>
In a pivotably mounted door (2), in particular for household appliances, a handle element (4) running parallel to the opening edge is mounted and guided in a manner pivotable about a pin (5) running parallel to the hinge pin (3) of the door (2), such that, by pivoting with respect to the door (2), the handle element (4) maintains its spatial alignment irrespective of the door position.

<CLAIMS>
Pivotably mounted door, particularly for domestic appliances with a handle with a
grip element, which in the closed state of the door projects from the door front, in the

region of the door edge remote from the abutment edge of the door, wherein the grip
element (4) is mounted in the door (2) to be pivotable about an axis (5) extending parallel

to the hinge axis (3) of the door for maintenance of the spatial orientation of the grip
element to be substantially independent of the door setting, characterised in that a control

gear in the form of a pull/push device for transmission of the pivot movement of the door is
arranged between the door grip (4) and the stationary region (1) bounding the door (1).
Pivotably mounted door according to claim 1, characterised in that the pull/push
device is constructed as a lever transmission.
Pivotably mounted door according to claim 2, characterised in that the control gear
is constructed as a lever transmission consisting of the door spacing between stati
onary
mounting axis and mounting axis of the door grip, the door grip spacing between the

mounting axis for the door and a mounting axis for a coupling rod, the effective length of
this coupling rod from the mounting axis for the door grip and a stationary mounting axis,

and the spacing of this stationary mounting axis from the stationary door mounting axis.
Pivotably mounted door according to claim 1, characterised in that the pull/push
device is constructed as a chain wheel gear.
Pivotably mounted door according to claim 2, characterised in that the push/pull
device is constructed as a Bowden pull.
Pivotably mounted door with a horizontally disposed pivot axis and weight
compensating arrangement in the door according to one of claims 1, 2, 4 and 5,

characterised in that the control gear element (6) is arranged between the door grip
element (4) and the weight compensating arrangement (7) and coupled thereto.
