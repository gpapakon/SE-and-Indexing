<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR DETERMINING MULTIPLE IMMUNOCOMPLEXES ON ONE SURFACE USING SPECTROSCOPYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention.The invention relates to a process of detecting one or more analytes in a sample through light-based methodology, especially that of scattered total internal reflectance spectroscopy or reflectance, using a single, multi-functional reactive surface.Technology Review.As immunoassays become increasingly important in the medical diagnostic field, various methods for determining the results of immunoassays are being developed and used. For example, methods using light of some sort, such as reflected light, fluorescent light or scattered light, determine if appropriate immunological binding pair members have complexed. One such method uses reflected light. A binding pair member, such as antigen, is coated or "spotted" on a carrier, a solid support, then exposed to a sample that may or may not contain the matching binding pair member, an antibody, and after allowing time for the reaction to occur, is placed in a reflectometer. The reflectometer scans the surface of the carrier with a light, and the intensity of the light reflected will change if the immunocomplex has formed. Currently, only one "spot" of material is used on a solid surface, and therefore only one test assay can be run on each solid support.Another light-based method is scattered total internal reflectance (STIR) spectroscopy. This is an analytical method that relies on the differences in the optical properties of two mediums to investigate a 

sample deposited at, or very near to, the interface of the two mediums. In general, STIR analysis takes advantage of the phenomenon of total internal reflectance wherein light, when directed at or near a critical angle through a high refractive index material toward the interface of that material with a second material having a lower refractive index, is almost completely reflected from that interface except for a microscopic evanescent light wave which propagates into the second material for only a short distance. As disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,939,350, when materials that are fluorescently labeled are brought to the interface of materials with different refractive indexes and within the field of the evanescent wave, the molecules can be made to fluoresce. In STIR spectroscopic analysis what is detected is not the fluorescence of a labeled molecule near the interface but rather the elastic scattering of an evanescent light wave by a light-scattering material such as
