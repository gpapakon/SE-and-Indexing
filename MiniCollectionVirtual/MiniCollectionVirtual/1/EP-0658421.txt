<ABSTRACT>
The flexible coextruded multilayer sheet for the manufacture of puches 
bags, containers of liquids to be steam sterilized at about 121°C comprises 

at least three layers (A-B-C) made of polyolefin (Co)-polymers, at least one 
of said layers, the central one (B), comprises (Co)-polyolefins having a 

melting point below 21°C ("non retortable"), the inner layer (A) and outer 
layer (C) consisting of "retortable" polyolefins. 
The central layer (B) comprises, at least partially, polyolefinic 
regranulated material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns coextruded multilayer films for the 
manufacture of containers of fluids requesting a steam sterilization 
treatment, for instance in autoclave at about 121° C or more. The coextruded 
structures according to the invention are based exclusively on halogen free 
particularly chlorine free, polyolefinic materials such as the propylene and 
ethylene polymers and respective (co-)polymers with minor quantities of 
alpha-olefins and/or elastomers. Characteristically said structures do not 
contain adhesive materials such as aromatic adhesive and polyolefins 
grafted with maleic anhydride used as bonding tie resins. As known, it is commercially available a wide range of basic films 
which, for semplicity reaseons may be grouped in the two following classes: 
I) mono-layer films of ethylene-butylene co-polymers with density below 
0.9, which are soft, elastic and very transparent. Their melting point 
is however below 100° C; they are tacky even at room temperature and 
the friction coefficient is well above the values acceptable in the 
process of forming and filling the bags, the so called 
FFS-form-fill-seal processing. The friction can be reduced by adding a 
slip agent as based on high molecular weight amides 
(erucamide-oleamide-steramide etc.) in large concentration but at the 
expenses of the monolayer film clarity. II) Monolayer films made of straight reactor thermoplastic polyolefins as 
those obtained by HIMONT CATALLOY technology (terpolymers of propylene, 
ethylene and ethylene-propylene rubber produced in a series of reactors)  
 
which are soft and generally clear and which can be made heat-resistant 
to the retorting process by a carefull selection of their grades. 
However they are tacky even at room temperature and only high amounts of 
slip agents would reduce their friction to make them processable in FFS 
equipment but this is at the expense of the film clarity- Furthermore 
when stored during a certain time the film blushes as low molecular 
weight entities migrate to the surface. Therefore it can be stated that monolayer films of groups I) and II) have 
the required softness to make bags, pouches, cases and the like for 
sterilized fluids however the treatment of sterilization at 121° C or more 
does not lead to an acceptable product. For the sake of simplicity we can 
therefore say that these materials are soft but not sterilizable 
(retortable). Many, many solutions of this problem have been proposed, among which 
the following ones can be cited. The US

Flexible multilayer coextruded film for the manufacture of containers of 
solutions, emulsions or fluids requesting a steam sterilizable treatment 

in autoclave at about 121° C or more (so called "retorting"), said 
containers being easely incinerated without release of toxic fumes, 

characterized in that the film comprises at least three layers (A-B-C) 
each consisting substantially of only olefin (co)-polymers, without 

bonding adhesive materials containing aromatic or grafted compounds, 
at least one (B) of said layers consisting of co-polyolefins not 

sterilizable in autoclave not-retortable. 
Film according to claim 1, characterized by: - a core or central layer 
(B) of not sterilizable polyolefins, having a melting point below 121°C 

and a thickness of from 50 to 200 microns and selected from the group 
consisting of: i) thermoplastic polyolefins; ii) ethylene-butylene 

copolymers with a density below 0.9; iii) blends of i) and/or ii) 
and/or a "retortable" polyolefin in a minor proportion, and/or a 

regranulated material;- an inner layer A) and outer layer C) each 
having a thickness of from 10 to 80 microns, consisting of 

"retortable" polyolefins selected from the group consisting of: x) 
polymers of propylene or copolymers of propylene with ethilene and/or 

butylene; y) (co-)polymers of ethylene with a minor proportion of an 
alpha-olefin containing at least six carbon atonms; and z) blends of 

x) and/or y) and minor quantity ef elastomers. 
Film according to claim 2, characterized in that the central core B) is 
divided in more layers, at least one of which (D) consists of only 

regranulated polyolefinic material. 
Bags containing steam sterilizable fluids, formed of a multilayer 
coextruded film, at least one of said layers comprising polyolefinic 

material not sterilizable in an autoclave, according to the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the thicknesses of the inner A) and outer 

C) layers which during the sterilization at about 121° C contribute to 
impart resistance to the bag, increase with increasing weight of the 

fluid contained in said bag, and with increasing thickness of layer B), 
and are above 40 microns for thickness of B) above 50 microns and for 

fluid quantity of at least 1 liter.
