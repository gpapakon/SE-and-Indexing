<ABSTRACT>
An ink printing system including a device (8) for drying the 
ink jet images printed on the 

surface of a substrate (2) by the system including a plurality 
of nozzles (14) that direct a small volume 

of air onto the printed image at as high a velocity as possible without disturbing the wet 
image. The air so delivered while it must be dry, does not have to be heated to effectively 

dry the image. However, the drying time can, if desired, be reduced by increasing the air 
temperature. The use of high velocity air creates what is known as "skin effect" to dry the 

ink where the outer surface of the ink is quickly dried.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an ink printing system and, more particularly, to an improved
device for drying the ink jet images.Ink printing systems that utilise ink jet printers find application in a wide variety of
printing applications. One such application is the printing of images, such as expiration dates
and lot numbers, on cans, bottles and the like, on high speed automated production lines.
Typically, the cans or bottles are filled with product, capped and labelled. The labelling
process includes the application of the ink jet images directly to a surface of the cans and
bottles and/or the labelling therefor. Because the ink jet imaging process occurs as part of
the high speed operation of the production lines, it must be carried out rapidly and efficiently,
i.e. the images must be applied and dried for further handling in a matter of seconds.The ink jet printers used in these high speed applications typically include an ink jet
nozzle having an orifice providing a stream of ink. A piezoelectric device surrounds and acts
upon the nozzle to cause the formation of drops as the ink leaves the nozzle orifice. The
drops are selectively charged by a charging electrode and pass through a deflection field. The
deflection field is created by opposed upper and lower electrodes where one electrode is
connected to a power supply and the other electrode is grounded, or connected to a power
supply of opposite polarity. The deflection field deflects selected drops to cause them to
strike the substrate being marked, i.e. the can or bottle, to create a desired ink jet image.
The drops that are not deflected to the substrate are caught by an ink catcher that returns the
drops to the ink system for reuse. Typical ink jet printers are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,845,512 issued to Arway and U.S. Patent No. 5,196,860 issued to Pickell et al.As will be apparent from the foregoing, the ink drops applied to the substrate, i.e. the
can, bottle, or paper labelling, will be wet immediately after application. Because ink jet 
printers are used in high speed applications, the wet ink presents handling problems in that the
wet ink can be easily smeared, or smudged. Thus, it is desired to dry the ink drops after the
substrate, on which the ink jet image is formed, has left the printer.Known ink jet image driers typically consist of a heating element and blower positioned
downstream of the printing station. The blower forces air over the heating element and onto the
newly printed image. The blowers used in this process
