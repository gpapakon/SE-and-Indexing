<ABSTRACT>
In an internal combustion engine control system for
controlling an internal combustion engine, comprising a

fuel injection control means for controlling fuel injection
quantity to be injected by a fuel supply system for

supplying fuel to the internal combustion engine, and fuel
injection timing, and a variable valve control means for

continuously or gradually varying at least opening timing,
closing timing or lift of a intake valve or an exhaust

valve for sealing up a combustion chamber of the internal
combustion engine, the fuel injection control means

controls at least fuel injection quantity or fuel injection
timing on the basis of a value of a controlled variable

provided by the variable valve control means. Since air
quantity can be regulated by a variable valve timing

mechanism, pumping loss and fuel consumption can be
reduced. Fuel injected into the combustion chamber can be

atomized by opening the intake valve so that a shock wave
is generated in the combustion chamber and, consequently,

stable combustion can be achieved without deteriorating the
quality of the exhaust gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal
combustion engine control system for controlling an
internal combustion engine and, more particularly, to an
internal combustion engine control system for controlling
intake air and fuel in an internal combustion engine.Generally, the timing of operations of the intake
valve and the exhaust valve of engines including direct
fuel injection engines is dependent only on the cam
profiles of cams driven for rotation in synchronism with
the rotation of the crankshaft of the engine. Accordingly,
it is difficult to achieve optimum valve timing control in
a wide range of operating condition. It is desirable to
vary valve timing according to the operating condition to
improve the output performance of the engine and the like.
It is necessary to vary valve timing so that valve overlap
period, i.e., a period in which both the intake and the 
exhaust valve are open, decreases to prevent the blowby of
new charge while the engine is operating at a relatively
low engine speed, and so that valve overlap period
increases to supply new charge at a high charging
efficiency by using exhaust gas pulsation while the engine
is operating at a relatively high engine speed.A technique relating to such a mode of control of
valve timing is disclosed in JP-A No. 6-101508. This prior
art technique controls negative pressure in the intake
pipe minutely at an optimum value, and controls the timing
of closing the intake valve on the basis of parameters
indicating the operating condition of the engine including
cooling water temperature, intake air temperature and time-dependent
changes in the engine in addition to a map
showing a function of engine speed and load to reduce
pumping loss.In an engine which is provided with a throttle
valve disposed before an intake system to regulate the quantity
of intake air and regulates the quantity of fuel to be
injected according to the quantity of intake air, the pressure
in the intake pipe is lower than the atmospheric pressure
in an operating range in which the load on the engine is
relatively low, energy necessary for lowering the piston, 
i.e., energy necessary to achieve a suction stroke (pumping
loss) increases, the ratio of pumping loss to engine output
increases and fuel consumption increases.The prior art technique, however, keeps the lift of
the intake valve and the opening angle fixed and does not
control the same. Therefore, the quantity of intake air to
be sucked into the combustion chamber of the engine must be
controlled by a throttle
