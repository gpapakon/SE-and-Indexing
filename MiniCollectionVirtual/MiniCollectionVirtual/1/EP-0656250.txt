<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is 
to operate an ejector for performing gate cutting 

and ejection of a molded piece in an injection 
molding machine at an optimal speed according 

to a molding purpose. In the present 
invention, a means for setting an operation 

speed in gate cutting and a means for setting 
an operation speed in ejecting a molded 

piece are provided in a control device for a hydraulic 
or electric driving means for operating 

an ejector pin. In accordance with a structure 
like this, an ejector device is operated during 

gate cutting by the means for setting an 
operation speed of the ejector device in gate 

cutting, and during the subsequent ejection of 
a molded piece, the ejector device is operated 

by the means for setting an operation speed for 
the ejector device in ejecting a molded piece, 

which is different from that used in gate cutting, 
whereby a molded piece is ejected from 

a mold. In addition, when the operation speed 
of the ejector device in gate cutting becomes 

relatively high, there is generated no trace of 
the gate in a molded piece, and when the operating 

speed of the ejector device in ejecting 
a molded piece becomes low, there is generated 

no crack in a molded piece when ejected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gate-cut and 
product-ejection control apparatus and method for use in an 
injection molding machine wherein a melted substance is 
injected into metallic molds so as to produce a molded 
product. An injection molding machine for injecting a melted 
substance such as a synthetic resin by means of hydraulic 
pressure so as to produce molded products normally comprises 
components for carrying out a gate cut and a product 
injection which are carried out in different steps. A conventional type of the injection molding machine 
carries out a gate cut and a product ejection by using the 
same ejector pin driven by a hydraulic ejector cylinder. In 
this case, the gate cut is performed by a full stroke of a 
hydraulic ejector and, after resin in a cavity is cooled 
down, the hydraulic ejector is again operated for ejecting a 
product. Another type of the conventional injection molding 
machine is provided with a gate cut pin and an ejector pin. 
Immediately after the resin is injected or while pressure is 
applied, the gate cut pin is operated by the hydraulic  
 
ejector cylinder for carrying out a gate cut. After the 
gate cut is complete, the gate cut pin is returned to its 
initial position. Subsequently, after the resin in the 
cavity is cooled down, a product is ejected out by operating 
the gate cut pin and the ejector pin driven by the hydraulic 
ejector cylinder. Either of the above-described types of the injection 
molding machine has a problem that the gate cut and the 
product ejection are carried out by operation of the 
hydraulic ejector at the same speed (flow) and pressure. 
That is, the gate cut may be carried at a speed and a 
pressure which have been appropriately set for the product 
ejection. In this case, the speed and the pressure are 
insufficient for carrying out the gate cut, resulting in 
that a gate trace will remain on the gate cut surface and a 
molding cycle is unnecessarily prolonged. On the contrary, in the case when the hydraulic ejector 
operation is set at the speed and the pressure which are 
appropriate for the gate cut, the speed is too high for the 
product ejection and cracks may be generated in the product. There is another problem that a typical hydraulic 
injection molding machine which has been recently developed 
is provided with a single electromagnetic flow control valve 
and a single electromagnetic pressure control valve for 
controlling speed (flow) and pressure of actuators, 
respectively, and incapable of simultaneously
