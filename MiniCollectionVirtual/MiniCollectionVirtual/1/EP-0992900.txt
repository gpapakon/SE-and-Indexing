<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for downloading
control software/operating systems of user interfaces

into an electronic device (1), which comprises two or
more processor blocks (2a, 2b), where in at least two

processor blocks (2a, 2b) a user interface (UI1, UI2) is
used. Furthermore, one or more operating systems are

executed in the electronic device (1). The downloading
is executed via one said processor block (2a, 2b),

wherein the control software/operating systems are
downloaded into said one processor block (2a, 2b), from

which the control software/operating systems related to
other user interfaces are loaded into said other

processor blocks (2a, 2b). The invention also relates to
an electronic device (1) which comprises at least one

processor (3a, 3b), at least two processor blocks (2a,
2b), at least one user interface (UI1, UI2), memory

means (4a) for storing the control software of the user
interface (UI1, UI2), means (8a, 8b, 10) for data

transmission between a first (2a) and a second
processor block (2b), and means (3a, 3b) for executing

the functions of two or more operating systems. The
invention also relates to a storing means for the

downloading program of the control software/operating
systems of the user interfaces in an electronic device

(1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method according to the preamble of
the appended claim 1 for downloading the control software of two or
more operating systems/user interfaces into an electronic device. The
invention also relates to an electronic device and storing means
according to the method.In this specification, the downloading of an operating system/user
interface refers to the installation of the operating system and/or user
interface into an electronic device in connection with its initialization, as
well as to the updating of pre-installed control software of the operating
system/user interface e.g. with a new version or with a different
language version.Electronic devices have been developed, in which features of two or
more different devices, such as a mobile station and a data processing
device, are combined. An example of such a device is the Nokia
Communicator, in which a mobile station and a personal digital
assistant are integrated in the same housing. However, these different
functional units may have separate components, such as processors,
memory means and a user interface which comprises for example a
display, a keypad, a receiver and/or a microphone. Nevertheless, these
functional blocks, which hereinbelow will be called a processor block,
are provided with a data transmission connection between them, e.g. a
serial bus, wherein these processor blocks can communicate with each
other. To control the functions of such a device, a device-specific
operating system is often developed. Typically, in such an integrated
device, a separate operating system is implemented for each processor
block. The basic function of the operating system is to take care of
processor block system timings, resource management, user interface
control, as well as message processing and transmission between the
different program blocks of the same processor block and between
different processor blocks.In an electronic device, the operating system or part of it is stored e.g.
in a fixed memory, such as a read only memory ROM. A problem with 
such a read only memory is, however, that in order to update the
operating system into a newer version, a new read only memory circuit
has to be installed, in which a new operating system version is stored.
This change is difficult and requires opening of the housing of the
device. Therefore, it has become common to use non-volatile random
access memory circuits NVRAM, by means of which it is possible to
update the operating system without opening the housing of the device.
