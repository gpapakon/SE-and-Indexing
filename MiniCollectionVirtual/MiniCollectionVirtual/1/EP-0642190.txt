<ABSTRACT>
A compact radar system (100) includes a dielectric 
substrate (108) having an upper and lower surface. A ground 

plane (114) is formed on the upper surface (115) of the dielectric 
substrate (108) and includes a radiating slot (116,117) formed therein. A 

radar transceiver (118) is located below the dielectric substrate (108) 
and generates transmit signals. A frequency selective 

surface (122) spaced above the dielectric substrate includes a 
radiating aperture (146,148) with a plurality of uniformly spaced 

holes. The frequency selective surface (122) decreases flow of 
electromagnetic energy from the radiating slot in one 

direction towards the transceiver and increases the flow of 
electromagnetic radiation in an opposite direction away 

from the transceiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radar sensors and, more
particularly, to a compact, flexible, and built-in
radiation structure for a millimeter wave radar sensor.Radar sensors are generally employed for
detecting objects within a desired field. Typical sensing
systems have been developed which employ radar, laser,
infrared (IR), or ultrasonic principles. However, each of
these systems has its drawbacks. Current radar sensors
operate at frequencies which are too low to incorporate the
advanced monolithic millimeter wave integrated circuit
(MMIC) and compact patch antenna technology. Generally,
these sensing units are bulky and difficult to integrate
into a host system. In addition, current radar sensing
units require a large number of components which make the
units costly. As a result, these systems are limited in
modularity and flexibility, and therefore, applications.
Typical laser sensors generally suffer from high cost, in 
addition to potential health hazards. Furthermore, they
are limited by environmental conditions such as fog and
smoke. Infrared and ultrasonic sensors have limitations
which include sensitivity to environmental interferences,
as well as interference from other similar sources, in
addition to noise.There is a need for an effective compact,
flexible and integrated radar sensor that can be easily
integrated into many systems for various applications. In
particular, there exists a need for a compact, low cost,
flexible radar sensor for automotive and space and defense-related
applications and the like. Such applications may
include integrating such a radar sensor onto an automotive
vehicle to provide a blind spot detector for crash
avoidance purposes. For advanced vehicle designs, such as
those involving four-wheel drive functions, there is a need
for a smart sensor to determine the true ground speed of
the vehicle for cruise control purposes, accurate vehicle
speed measurement, and four-wheel steering. In addition,
there exists a need for a smart sensor to determine the
vehicle height and to project the road surface ahead for
advanced adaptive suspension systems. Furthermore, for
military applications, there exists a need for a compact,
modular, low cost sensor for collision avoidance or armored
vehicles, heavy robotic equipment and all types of
transportation equipment during night operations and under
adverse conditions such as fog and battle field smoke. Sensor systems have been developed and provided
for such applications. Typical systems have generally
employed radar, laser,
