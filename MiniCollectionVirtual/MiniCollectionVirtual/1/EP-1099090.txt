<ABSTRACT>
A missile (20) has a body (22) with a substantially circular nose opening (42) therein, and a ceramic radome (21) sized to cover the nose opening (42). A compliant metallic circular "T"-flexure element (46) is disposed structurally between the radome (21) and the body (22) and is integral with the body (22). A niobium-containing washer (47) is disposed between the radome (21) and the "T"-flexure element (46). The "T"-flexure element (46) includes an elongated compliant arm region (48) and a cross bar region (50) positioned adjacent the radome (21) such that the niobium-containing washer (47) is situated between a lower margin surface (36) of the radome (21) and an upper side (50a) of the crossbar region (50). A first brazed butt joint (54) is formed between the lower margin surface (36) of the radome (21) and an upper surface (47a) of the niobium-containing washer (47), while a second brazed butt joint (58) is formed between a lower surface (47b) of the niobium-containing washer (47) and the crossbar region (50) of the "T"-flexure element (46). Two separate brazing materials (92, 94) are employed to be compatible with the respective materials (radome (21) and niobium washer (47); niobium washer (47) and "T"-flexure element (46)), but have substantially the same brazing temperature to permit brazing the radome (21) to the body (22) in a single brazing operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is related to the following applications: (1) "Vehicle
Having a Ceramic Radome Affixed Thereto by a Compliant Metallic Transition
Element", Serial No. 08/710,051, filed September 10, 1996; (2) "Vehicle Having a
Ceramic Radome Joined Thereto by an Actively Brazed Compliant Metallic Transition
Element", Serial No. 08/711,637, filed September 10, 1996; and (3) "Vehicle
Having a Ceramic Radome with a Compliant, Disengageable Attachment", Serial
No. 08/709,929, filed September 9, 1996.The present invention relates to a vehicle having a ceramic radome, and,
more particularly, to the attachment of the ceramic radome to the vehicle.Outwardly-looking radar, infrared, and/or visible-light sensors built into vehicles
such as aircraft or missiles are usually protected by a covering termed a radome.
The radome serves as a window that transmits the radiation sensed by the sensor.
It also acts as a structural element that protects the sensor and carries aerodynamic 
loadings. In many cases, the radome protects a forward-looking sensor, so that
the radome must bear large aerostructural loadings.Where the vehicle moves relatively slowly, as in the case of helicopters, subsonic
aircraft, and ground vehicles, some radomes are made of nonmetallic organic
materials which have good energy transmission and low signal distortion, and can
support small-to-moderate structural loadings at low-to-intermediate temperatures.
For those vehicles that fly much faster, such as hypersonic aircraft or missiles flying
in the Mach 3-20 range, nonmetallic organic materials are inadequate for use in radomes
because aerodynamic friction heats the radome above the maximum operating
temperature of the organic material.In such cases, the radome is made of a ceramic material that has good elevated
temperature strength and good energy transmission characteristics. However,
existing ceramics have the shortcoming that they are relatively brittle and easily
fractured. The likelihood of fracture is increased by small surface defects in the ceramic
and externally-imposed stresses and strains. The ceramic radome is hermeticlly
attached to the body of the missile, which is typically made of a metal with high-temperature
strength, such as a titanium alloy.The ceramic has a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), and
the metal missile body has a relatively high CTE. When the missile body and radome
are heated, the resulting CTE-mismatch strain between the radome and the missile
body can greatly increase the propensity
