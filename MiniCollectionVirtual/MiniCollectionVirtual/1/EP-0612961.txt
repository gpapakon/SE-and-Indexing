A method of determining characteristic features of processes that form radicals by
detecting the radiation intensity of band radiation of multiple radicals, characterized in

that the temperature and / or the radical concentration is detected in such zones (8)
which are monitored simultaneously by at least two detectors wherein said radiation

sensed by the detectors (6) arriving from zones (8) along discret radiation directions
(7), is spectrally analysed, in order to simultaneously detecting the band radiation

intensities of multiple radicals and projected on a photon-sensitive detection-matrix,
comprising a number of columns corresponding with the number of radiation directions

and a number of lines corresponding with the fineness of the spectral analysis and
wherein the detectors transmit signals corresponding with the detected radiation

intensities through connections for their evaluation to an evaluation computing unit.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the radiation intensities of bandfree
wavelength ranges together with the radiation intensity of band radiation are also

detected.
A method according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the radiation spectrum is
sensed by detectors comprising a beam angle of essentially 90Â°.
A method according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the detectors sense integral
radiation intensities along various radiation directions.
A method according to claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the radiation spectrum is
evaluated tomographically. 
A method according to claims 1 to 5, characterized in that dust and / or soot particle
concentrations are determined within and outside of the zones.
A method according to claims 1 to 6, characterized in that additionally the radiation of a
reference radiator is detected.
Use of the method according to claims 1 to 7, for the detection of temperature and / or
radical concentration within an incineration chamber or within a reactor.
Device for determining characteristic features of processes that form radicals wherein
the radiation intensities of band radiation of multiple radicals is detected, characterized

in that at least two detectors are installed for the detection of radiation of zones (8),
which, along discrete radiation directions, can be monitored simultaneously by the

detectors, that the detectors comprise a spectrometer each for spectrally analysing the
arriving radiation and a photon-senvitive detection matrix, wherein each detection

matrix comprises a number of columns corresponding with the number of radiation
directions and a number of lines corresponding with the fineness of the spectral

analysis and comprising an evaluation computing unit (10) for temperature and / or
radical concentration within the zones (8), which are connected to the detectors.
