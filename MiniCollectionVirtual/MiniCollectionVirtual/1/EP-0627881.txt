Insect repellant containing at least one fatty acid 
alkyl ester having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl 

group and at least one natural, nature-identical or 
synthetic fatty alcohol as the active substance and at 

least one natural or nature-identical vegetable or 
animal fatty oil from the group comprising rapeseed 

oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil/butter, soya oil, 
safflower seed oil, cuphea oil, coconut oil, palm 

kernel oil, palm oil and fish oil as the carrier. 
Insect repellant according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 it contains 1 to 99 wt.% of the fatty acid 
alkyl ester and 99 to 1 wt.% of the fatty alcohol. 
Insect repellant according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 it contains 75 to 98 wt.% of the fatty acid 
alkyl ester and 2 to 25 wt.% of the fatty oil. 
Insect repellant according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 it contains 8 to 70 wt.% of the fatty acid 
alkyl ester, 5 to 90 wt.% of the fatty alcohol and 2 

to 25 wt.% of the fatty oil. 
Insect repellant according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
 it additionally contains at 
least one free fatty acid as a carrier. 
Insect repellant according to claim 5, 
characterised
 
in that it contains 75 to 98 wt.% of the fatty acid 

alkyl ester and 25 to 2 wt.% of the free fatty acid. 
Insect repellant according to claim 5, 
characterised 
in that
 it contains 1 to 97 wt.% of the fatty acid 
alkyl ester, 1 to 97 wt.% of the fatty alcohol and 2 

to 25 wt.% of the free fatty acid.  
 
Insect repellant according to claim 5, 
characterised 
in that
 it contains 1 to 96 wt.% of the fatty acid 
alkyl ester, 2 to 25 wt.% of the fatty oil and 2 to 

25 wt.% of the free fatty acid. 
Insect repellant according to claim 5, 
characterised 
in that
 it contains 1 to 95 wt.% of the fatty acid 
alkyl ester, 1 to 95 wt.% of the fatty alcohol, 2 to 

25 wt.% of the fatty oil and 2 to 25 wt.% of the free 
fatty acid. 
Insect repellant according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 the fatty acid alkyl ester is a 
methyl, ethyl or butyl ester of fatty acids prepared 

from natural or nature-identical vegetable or animal 
fatty oils from the group comprising rapeseed oil, 

sunflower oil, peanut oil/butter, soya oil, safflower seed 
oil, Cuphea oil, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, palm 

oil and fish oil. 
Insect repellant according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the natural fatty alcohols are obtainable from 
vegetable and/or animal oils and/or from the fatty 

acids and/or fatty acid alkyl esters obtainable 
therefrom. 
Insect repellant according to claim 1, 
characterised 
in that
 the nature-identical and/or synthetic fatty 
alcohols are obtainable from paraffin and/or ethene. 
Insect repellant according to claim 11 or 12, 

characterised in that
 the natural, nature-identical 
and synthetic fatty alcohols contain 5 to 18 carbon 

atoms. 
Insect repellant according to one of claims 11 to 13, 

characterised in that

and synthetic fatty alcohols are saturated or contain 
1 to 3 unsaturated bonds per molecule. 
Insect repellant according to claim 5, 
characterised 
in that
 the fatty acids are obtainable by hydrolytic 
cleavage of natural or nature-identical vegetable 

and/or animal oils. 
Insect repellant according to claim 15, 
characterised 
in that
 the fatty acids contain 6 to 19 carbon atoms 
in the chain. 
Use of the insect repellant according to one of claims
