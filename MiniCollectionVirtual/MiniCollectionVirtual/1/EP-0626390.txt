<ABSTRACT>
CDR-grafted antibody heavy and light chains comprise 
acceptor framework and donor antigen binding regions, the 

heavy chains comprising donor residues at at least one of 
positions (6, 23) and/or (24, 48) and/or (49, 71) and/or 

(73, 75) and/or (76) and/or (78) and (88) and/or (91). The 
CDR-grafted light chains comprise donor residues at at least 

one of positions (1) and/or (3) and (46) and/or (47) or at 
at least one of positions (46, 48, 58) and (71). The CDR-grafted 

antibodies are preferably humanised antibodies, 
having non human, e.g. rodent, donor and human acceptor 

frameworks, and may be used for 
in vivo
 therapy and 
diagnosis. A generally applicable protocol is disclosed for 

obtaining CDR-grafted antibodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to humanised antibody
molecules
and to therapeutic
or diagnostic compositions containing them.The term "humanised antibody molecule" is used to describe
a molecule having an antigen binding site derived from an
immunoglobulin from a non-human species, and remaining
immunoglobulin-derived parts of the molecule being derived
from a human immunoglobulin. The antigen binding site
typically comprises complementarity determining regions
(CDRs) which determine the binding specificity of the
antibody molecule and which are carried on appropriate
framework regions in the variable domains. There are 3
CDRs (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3) in each of the heavy and light
chain variable domains.In the description, reference is made to a number of
publications by number. The publications are listed in
numerical order at the end of the description.Natural immunoglobulins have been known for many years, as
have the various fragments thereof, such as the Fab,
(Fab')2 and Fc fragments, which can be derived by
enzymatic cleavage. Natural immunoglobulins comprise a
generally Y-shaped molecule having an antigen-binding site
towards the end of each upper arm. The remainder of the
structure, and particularly the stem of the Y, mediates
the effector functions associated with immunoglobulins.Natural immunoglobulins have been used in assay, diagnosis
and, to a more limited extent, therapy. However, such
uses, especially in therapy, were hindered until recently
by the polyclonal nature of natural immunoglobulins. A
significant step towards the realisation of the potential 
of immunoglobulins as therapeutic agents was the discovery
of procedures for the production of monoclonal antibodies
(MAbs) of defined specificity (1).However, most MAbs are produced by hybridomas which are
fusions of rodent spleen cells with rodent myeloma
cells. They are therefore essentially rodent proteins.
There are very few reports of the production of human MAbs.Since most available MAbs are of rodent origin, they are
naturally antigenic in humans and thus can give rise to an
undesirable immune response termed the HAMA (Human
Anti-Mouse Antibody) response. Therefore, the use of
rodent MAbs as therapeutic agents in humans is inherently
limited by the fact that the human subject will mount an
immunological response to the MAb and will either remove
it entirely or at least reduce its effectiveness. In
practice, MAbs of rodent origin may not be used in
patients for more than one or a few treatments as a HAMA
response soon develops
