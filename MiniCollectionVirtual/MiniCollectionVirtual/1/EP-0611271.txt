<DESCRIPTION>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION : This invention relates to polypropylene film,
specifically to mono-axially oriented polypropylene film with sodium
benzoate as a nucleating agent to reduce shrinkage and increase
stretchability.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART : Polypropylene copolymers and homopolymers
are produced in numerous grades and formulations. Among the outstanding
properties of polypropylene are low density, high melting point, high
tensile strength, rigidity, stress crack resistance, abrasion resistance,
low creep and a surface which is highly resistance to chemical attack.Polypropylene film (usually 1.27.10-5 to 2.54.10-5m (0.5 to 1.0 mil) in
thickness) is made by tubular and casting film extrusion methods. Two forms
of polypropylene film are produced, oriented and unoriented. Unoriented
film has good transparency, tensile strength, machinability, electrical
properties, high gloss, resistant to grease and oil, heat resistance and can
be printed, coated and heat-sealed. Orienting polypropylene film improves some of its properties, particularly
tensile strength, stiffness, moisture- and gas-barrier properties, grease
and oil resistance, low-temperature impact strength, abrasion resistance,
optical properties and heat shrinkability.In a tape orienting process, amorphous orientation and destruction of
crystal structure in cold-drawing lead to a thermodynamically unstable
system which, given some time, tend toward some equilibrium. Given the
opportunity, the strained molecular segments in this unstable system will
try to rearrange themselves in a state of lowest potential energy. The
process results in tape shrinkage and, consequently, tape dimension
instability.The use of inorganic fillers to improve the mechanical properties of
polyolefin films is known. Using very small amounts (below 0.5wt%) a
significant improvement in transparency is attained. This improvement is
attributed to the formation of smaller, more numerous spherulites as the
polymer solidifies from the molten state. Accompanying this change in
morphology is a marked increase in crystallization rate and a higher
crystallization temperature. In addition to the improved optical
properties, nucleation results in better processing characteristics and
improved strength.Certain inorganic fillers and organic compounds serve as nucleating agents
for polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamides,
polypropylene and polybutylene. Addition of these nucleating agents to olefin polymers provides an increase
in the crystallization temperature
