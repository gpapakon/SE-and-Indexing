<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a bismaleimide compound of formula (I) substantially free of oligomeric, amidic and uncyclized impurities, wherein Ar is an optionally substituted aromatic residue; and Ar' is an optionally substituted aromatic residue which provides either good conjugation between the nitrogen-containing groups shown in formula (I) or steric or other restrictions capable of moderating the reactivity of an unreacted amine moiety attached to said residue, methods for their preparation and curable compositions containing them. The curable compositions may also be used in impregnated fibre reinforced materials and advanced composite materials.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BISMALEIMIDE COMPOUNDSThis invention relates to bismaleimide compounds and polymers, particularly high temperature resistant polymers, prepared from them.Bismaleimide derivatives of simple arydiamines can be used to prepare polyimides of good thermal stability. However, such bismaleimide derivatives are often difficult to process, and produce on curing, polymers with properties only marginally better than epαxy derived materials. Furthermore, such bismaleimides compounds have either been derivatives of relatively simple diamino compounds or ill defined products made from the co-reaction of a number of polyfunctional materials.GB 1,137,592 and US 3,010,290 describe the preparation of bismaleimide compounds by reaction of maleic anhydride with some simple diarylamines. These products when converted to polymers with curing agents known in the art are generally more brittle than is desired for advanced composite use and as a result toughening agents are often necessary. This tends to lead to increased cost in processing and less reproducibility.An alternative approach to improve toughness is to prepare thermally stable bismaleimide compounds of higher molecular weight so that on curing there will be greater molecular weight between crosslinks. However, it is a challenge to prepare relatively homogeneous materials and still retain some processibility and good thermal properties.US 3,998,786 discloses a method of preparing maleimide terminated oligo-imide materials. This method involves a one pot reaction for preparing the curable resin of an arylimide type, relying solely on stoichiometry of the reactants (dianhydride, diamine and maleic anhydride) to determine the structure of the resulting maleimide. 

US 3,998,786 suggests that a wide range of possible diamines and dianhydrides are suitable starting materials in synthesis, and as a consequence, some of the claimed products are alleged to have structures corresponding to those of the present application. However in our attempts to duplicate the method described in US 3,998,786 complex mixtures of chemicals, including considerable amounts of uncyclized and oligomeric material, were produced. This result is not unexpected, given the number of possible reactions, this type of synthesis would be expected to produce a complex mixture of different types of products which are very difficult to separate. Although no data is provided in US 3,998,786, the resultant polyimides produced on curing such products could be inconsistent in properties from batch to batch
