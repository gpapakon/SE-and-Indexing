<ABSTRACT>
A flexible cable assembly for coupling an electronic apparatus, 
having a port for receiving personal computer cards in accordance with 

the PCMCIA standard, to at least one peripheral device, said flex cable 
assembly comprises a personal computer card connector, in accordance with 

the PCMCIA standard, for connecting into a corresponding port in the 
electronic apparatus, and a flexible cable connected to the personal 

computer card connector. The personal computer card connector also 
comprises an interface to said at least one peripheral device. In 

accordance with a further aspect of the invention, the flex cable 
assembly can also couple a first electronic apparatus, to a second 

electronic apparatus, each having a port for receiving personal computer 
cards in accordance with the PCMCIA standard. This flex cable assembly 

comprises (1) a first PCMCIA card connector for connecting into a 
corresponding port in either the first or second electronic apparatus; 

(2) a second PCMCIA card connector for connecting into a corresponding 
port in either the first or second electronic apparatus; and (3) a flex 

cable coupled between the first and second personal computer card 
connectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This present invention relates to connecting means for connecting 
personal computers to peripheral devices or to other personal computers. Personal computer systems in general and IBM personal computers in 
particular have attained widespread use for providing computer power to 
many segments of today's modern society. Personal computer systems can 
usually be defined as a desk top, floor standing, or portable 
microcomputer that consists of a system unit having a single system 
processor and associated volatile and non-volatile memory, a display 
monitor, a keyboard, one or more diskette drives, a fixed disk storage, 
and an optional printer. One of the distinguishing characteristics of 
these systems is the use of a motherboard, or system planar, to 
electrically connect these components together. These systems are designed 
primarily to give independent computing capability to a single 
user and are inexpensively priced for purchase by individuals or small 
businesses. Examples of such personal computer systems are IBM's 
PERSONAL COMPUTER XT and AT and IBM's PERSONAL SYSTEM/2 Models 25, 30, 
35, 40, 50, 55, 56, 57, 60, 65, 70, 80, 90, and 95. These systems can be classified into two general families. The 
first family, usually referred to as Family I Models, use a bus 
architecture exemplified by the IBM PERSONAL COMPUTER AT and other "IBM 
compatible" machines. The second family, referred to as Family II 
Models, use IBM's MICRO CHANNEL bus architecture exemplified by IBM's 
PERSONAL SYSTEM/2 Models 50 through 80. Many Family I models have used 
the popular INTEL 8088 or 8086 microprocessor as the system processor. 
These processors have the ability to address one megabyte of memory. 
Certain Family I and most Family II models typically use the high speed 
INTEL 80286, 80386, and 80486 microprocessors which can operate in a real 
mode to emulate the slower speed INTEL 8086 microprocessor or a protected 
mode which extends the addressing range from 1 megabyte to 4 Gigabytes 
for some models. In essence, the real mode feature of the 80286, 80386, 
and 80486 processors provide hardware compatibility with software written 
for the 8086 and 8088 microprocessors. Such personal computers are characterized as having an "open" 
architecture. That is, the systems are designed and constructed in such 
a way that additional peripheral devices, such as removable media direct 
access storage devices (or DASD) may be selected and added to the  
 
systems, or an existing device may be changed for a device of a
