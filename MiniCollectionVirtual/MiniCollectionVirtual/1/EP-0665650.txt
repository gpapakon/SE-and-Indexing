<ABSTRACT>
A circuit (2) is described for detecting the difference in phase and 
frequency between two incoming signals (F
IN
, F
BK
). Digital output signals (UP, DN) 
are produced whose widths vary according to the degree of phase lead or phase lag 

of one signal over the other. 
First sub-circuits (34, 36) are connected, one to each of the input signals 
F
IN
, F
BK
, and produce an output pulse of short duration compared to the period of 
the incoming signal at the rising transitions of the associated input signal; two 

resettable pulse detection circuits (44, 45) each have an output (Q
RPD
) set to a first 
stable state (1) when an active signal is received on a reset input (RST) and 

changing to a second stable state (0) when a short duration pulse is received from 
a respective one of said subcircuits (44, 45) on a pulse input (EDG). Further 

circuitry is connected such that when both outputs (Q
RPD
) of the resettable pulse 
detection circuits are in the second stable state (0), an active reset signal (RST) is 

supplied to both resettable pulse detection circuits (44, 45), to return both of their 
outputs (Q
RPD
) to said first stable state (1). The outputs of the resettable pulse 
detection circuits are the outputs (UP, DN) of the circuit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to phase and frequency comparators used in 
phase locked loops and more particularly to two-input/two-output comparators, the 
first output providing a signal of greater duty cycle than the signal provided by the 
second output when the first input signal is in phase advance with respect to the 
second input signal, and the second output providing a signal of greater duty cycle 
than signal provided by the first output when the second input signal is in phase 
advance with respect to the first input signal. Phase locked loops (PLLs) are well known and popular circuit blocks. They 
find application as clock generators, frequency or phase demodulators, frequency 
multipliers, clock recovery devices and 'cleaners' of noisy input signals. Considering figure 1, all phase locked loops 1 consist of certain functional 
elements - a phase detector 2 which detects the difference in phase between two 
input signals, the first of which, FIN, is the input to the PLL circuit. The phase 
detector 2 produces signals which are then processed by circuitry 3, 4, 5 to form an 
analogue voltage level representative of the phase relationship between the two 
inputs to the phase detector 2. This analogue voltage is used to vary the output 
frequency FOUT of a voltage controlled oscillator 6. The output FOUT of this oscillator 6 may directly be the second input signal 
FBK of the phase detector 2, providing negative feedback. Alternatively, a frequency 
divider 7 may be connected between the output of the oscillator 6 and the second 
input of the phase detector 2 in order to obtain an oscillator output FOUT which has 
a frequency a multiple of that of the input signal FIN. This multiple is determined 
by the division ratio of the frequency divider 7. The functionality of such a circuit is as follows: the phase detector 2 
compares the phases of the first and second input signals FIN, FBK, being the PLL 
input signal and the feedback signal, respectively. The phase detector 2 produces 
an output, usually in the form of digital pulses, representing the phase difference 
between these two signals. The PLL input signal FIN will either lead, lag or be in 
phase with the feedback signal FBK. If the PLL input signal FIN leads the feedback 
signal FBK the phase frequency detector 2 sends output pulses on what is normally 
called the UP output (to indicate that the oscillator needs to increase in frequency 
to reduce the phase difference between its output signal FOUT and the PLL input  
 
signal FIN).
