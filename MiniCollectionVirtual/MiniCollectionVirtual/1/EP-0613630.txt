<ABSTRACT>
A hair curler is disclosed, which consists of a curler body (2) and projections (1, 3) mounted thereon. The curler body has the basic shape of a cylinder and serves to receive the hair. At the two end faces of the curler body, a cord-like projection (1, 3) is mounted in each case, the two free ends (4, 5) of which projection can be tied on the side of the curler body and thus firmly hold the curler body with the hair wound onto it.

Hair curler for rolling up and securing dry or wetted 
hair, with a cylindrical winding body (2) comprising at 

both ends cord-like extensions (1, 3) which can be tied 
together, characterised in that the cord-like extensions 

(1, 3) comprise a respective thickened portion (4, 5, 4a, 
5a) at their free ends in order to obtain a positive 

locking component when the extensions are tied. 
Hair curler for rolling up and securing dry or wetted 
hair, with a plurality of cylindrical winding bodies (2a, 

2b, 2c) which are joined together like a chain at their 
end faces by cord-like connection pieces (8a, 8b), 

wherein the two outer winding bodies (2a, 2c) comprise at 
their outer ends cord-like extensions (1, 3) which can be 

tied together and comprise a respective thickened portion 
(4, 5) at their free ends in order to obtain a positive 

locking component when the extensions are tied. 
Hair curler according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the hair curler is made of one part. 
Hair curler according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the hair curler is formed from a round sealing cord 

foamed from plastic in an extrusion-type process. 
Hair curler according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the hair curler is made of several parts with a 

first part (7), which consists of a cord piece with the 
cord-like extensions and the thickened portions, and at 

least one second part (6), which consists of the 
cylindrical winding body (2) or the plurality of 

cylindrical winding bodies (2a, 2b, 2c), which comprise a 
bore for holding the first part.  

 
Hair curler according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the cord-like extensions (1, 3) 

each comprise a plurality of thickened portions along 
their length in order to obtain a positive locking 

component with a corresponding plurality of engagement 
points when the extensions are tied. 
Hair curler according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the winding body or bodies (2, 2a, 

2b, 2c) is/are covered with plastic, wood, cork, foamed 
plastic or metal. 
Hair curler according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the winding body or bodies (2, 2a, 

2b, 2c) is/are provided with longitudinal or cross ribs 
or depressions. 
Hair curler according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the thickened portions are formed 

by placing bodies of plastic, wood, cork, foamed plastic 
or metal over the free ends of the extensions (1, 3), 
Process for producing a hair curler according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the cylindrical 

winding body (2), the cord-like extensions (1, 3) and the 
thickened portions (4, 5, 4a, 5a) of the hair curler or 

the plurality of cylindrical winding bodies (2a, 2b, 2c), 
the cord-like connection pieces (8a, 8b), the cord-like 

extensions (1, 3) and the thickened portions (4, 5) of 
the hair curler are cut to length from a round sealing 

cord foamed in an extrusion type process and formed by 
machining, by changing the cross section of the outlet 

nozzle, by changing the take-off speed, by changing the 
pressure when using direct gassing, by twisting the cord 

when extrusion foaming or by using an appropriate mould 
following the emergence of the round sealing cord from 

the nozzle.  
 
Process for producing a hair curler according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the hair curler is 

produced according to an extrusion blow moulding process. 
Process for producing a hair curler according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the hair curler is 

produced according to an injection moulding process.
