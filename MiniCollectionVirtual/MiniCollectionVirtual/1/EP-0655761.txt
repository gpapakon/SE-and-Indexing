<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydraulic device for operating at least one component which can move linearly, especially the moving contact piece of a medium-voltage or high-voltage power circuit breaker (power switch), having in each case one piston/cylinder arrangement (20) which is assigned to the at least one component, having a high-pressure reservoir (36 to 42) from which a highly pressurised hydraulic fluid can be supplied to the piston/cylinder arrangement (20), and having a low-pressure reservoir for the hydraulic fluid. The hydraulic fluid is conveyed from the low-pressure reservoir to the high-pressure reservoir by means of a pump (28, 29). The individual components of the hydraulic device are connected to a central distribution device (18) which has at least one line (34, 35) in each case for hydraulic fluid which is subject to high pressure and hydraulic fluid which is subject to low pressure.
