<ABSTRACT>
The method involves using a balance device with ball weights (13) moving freely in a circular track (12) concentric to the drum (2). An imbalance detection unit (6b,c) produces an imbalance signal during rotation or fluctuations in rotation speed. The system is rotated at a speed below its critical rotation speed, or that of its bearing system. The balancing unit is made so that the ball weights are carried in the track at this rotation speed. An evaluation unit (6d) produces the curve of imbalance amount and accelerates the bodies to a rotation speed above the critical speed in the area of the curve minimum or on exceeding a threshold value.

Method of balancing-out a body, which is set in rotation by a regulated
drive, by using a balancing-out apparatus, comprising at least one circular travel

path (12), which rotates with the body and is disposed concentrically relative to
its rotational axis, within which travel path weights (13) are disposed in a freely

displaceable manner, and by using an imbalance detecting means (6b, c), which
converts the deflections, caused by an imbalance, of the system comprising the

body and the balancing-out apparatus during the rotation and/or the speed
variations of said system, caused by an imbalance, into an imbalance signal, the

system being rotated, in a first method step for imbalance detection, at a speed
below its critical speed or below the critical speed of its bearing system, and the

balancing-out apparatus being provided in such a manner that the weights (13)
are entrained at this speed by the travel path(s) (12), 
characterised in that
 an
evaluation circuit (6d) determines the envelope curve of the amount of the

imbalance signal and, in the region of its minimum or in the case of a limit
value not being reached, accelerates the body to a speed above its critical speed

or the critical speed of its bearing system.
Method of balancing-out a rotating body according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the evaluation circuit, by taking account of operating
parameters, determines a value for starting the acceleration to a speed above the

critical speed of the body or of its bearing system, the value occurring before
the first minimum of the envelope curve of the amount of the imbalance signal

is reached.
Method of balancing-out a rotating body according to claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 speed-setting or respectively regulating means, which act 
on the drive, impart at least one positive or negative acceleration pulse to the

system during a complete revolution of the system.
Method of balancing-out a rotating body according to claim 3,

characterised in that
 the positive or negative acceleration pulses act periodically
on the system.
Method of balancing-out a body, which rotates about an approximately
horizontal rotational axis, according to at least one of claims 1 to 4,


characterised by
 the use of a means, disposed in the travel path(s) (12), for
increasing the travel friction of the weights or of the flow resistance of the travel

path(s).
Method of balancing-out a body, which rotates about an approximately
horizontal rotational axis, according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the means
for increasing the flow resistance of the travel path(s) (12) comprises a viscous

damping means (14), the viscosity of which is such that the weights (13) are
entrained in the speed range in which the imbalance detection is effected.
Method of balancing-out the drum (2) of a drum-type washing machine
according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the imbalance
detection is effected above a speed at which the laundry abuts against the drum

casing (2c) by centrifugal acceleration.
Method of balancing-out a drum (2) according to claim 7, 
characterised in
that
 a laundry imbalance is produced, which is prescribed according to
magnitude and/or position.
