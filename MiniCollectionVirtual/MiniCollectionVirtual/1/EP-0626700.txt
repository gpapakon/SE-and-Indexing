<ABSTRACT>
A micro-channel plate for use in focusing X-rays or particles of 
equivalent wavelengths comprises a radially packed array of square 

pores (12). For focussing parallel rays, a micro-channel plate consisting 
of two, square-pore, spherically slumped radially packed micro-channel 

plate elements (14,15) of different radii of curvature and overlying one 
another, forming for example a concavo-convex compound plate, is 

capable of providing a greater effective area at high X-ray energies.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to micro-channel plates (MCP's). The 
invention is concerned particularly with MCP's for use in imaging x-rays 
and particles having equivalent wavelengths. MCP's have been utilised to perform a lens function in x-ray and 
the like imaging applications. X-rays, or, particles reflected at grazing 
incidence from the internal glass walls of the channels, or pores, of the 
MCP can be brought to a focus. Square pore MCP's have been successfully applied in focusing X-rays 
or particles having equivalent wavelengths, for example neutrons, 
and have been used for example in X-ray telescopes. Other possible 
uses include X-ray lithography, flux concentration for X-ray scattering 
experiments, neutron focusing, X-ray microscopy and in diagnostic and 
therapeutic X-ray machines. The use of square pore MCPs in X-ray imaging is described in, for 
example, the paper entitled "X-ray focusing using micro-channel plates" 
by P. Kaaret et al published in Applied Optics vol. 31, No. 34, pages 
7339 to 7343, 1992. In an experimental arrangement described in this 
paper a flat (planar) MCP is utilised to focus diverging X-rays from a 
point source located at a finite distance from the MCP to an image. The 
pores of the MCP are parallel to each other and tilted relative to the 
surface by a bias angle and the MCP is orientated such that the pore 
axes are parallel to the optical axis. As is mentioned in this paper, square pore MCP's are considered 
to offer an improvement over MCP's having circular pores as they lead 
to a significant increase in the intensity of the focused beam which, it 
is said, is due to the fact that the angles of incidence and reflection are 
the same regardless of the point of reflection in the square geometry.  
 Square pore MCP's for X-ray and the like imaging have also been 
produced in a spherically slumped configuration in which the axis of 
each pore is aligned radially with respect to a spherical surface. By 
arranging that the axes of the pores extend normal to the spherical 
surface in this manner, parallel rays from a source at infinity can be 
imaged. The use of such an MCP is reported in the paper entitled "X-ray 
focussing using microchannel plates" by G. W. Fraser et al 
published in SPIE Proceeding, Vol. 1546, page 41-52, 1991. In these MCP's the pores are square-packed, that is to say, in 
cross-section, the pores are arranged in othogonal rows and columns, 
in a grid like pattern. We have found that improved results are achieved with a different 
arrangement.
