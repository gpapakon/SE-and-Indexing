<ABSTRACT>
Flavor enhancing compositions include an aqueous mixture containing charged colloidal silica of preferable 10-100 angstrom particle size. The colloidal silica acts synergistically with other flavor inducing agents. The compositions enhance flavor, tenderize meats, aid in the formation of a stable crust on breaded fired foods, and impart improved body, consistency, and flavor in soups, dressings, and beverages. The colloidal silica may be generated by circulating an aqueous solution containing colloidal silica particles, preferably in about 3 to about 4 molar NaOH with citric acid or a salt thereof also present, through a magnetic field so that the silica particles cut through the field to generate a charge thereon. The solution is preferably circulated through a helical coil (21) in a magnetic field created by a quadrilateral arrangement of magnets (34, 35, 36 and 37), and then passes through an area of magnetic void (33) between the magnets. The solution is diluted and titrated as it is circulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLAVOR ENHANCING COMPOSITION CONTAININGCOLLOIDAL SILICA AND METHOD FOR ITSPREPARATION AND USESPECIFICATIONBackground of the InventionField; The present invention relates to flavor enhancing agents and flavor potentiators for use with foods, and to methods of preparing such enhancers.State of the Art; Various flavor potentiators and flavor enhancers are known and in common use with food products. Flavor potentiators are believed to increase the sensitivity of taste buds, thus increasing the natural flavors in foods. Flavor enhancers, when added to foods, are believed to act as solvents or detergents to free more flavor from foods, to make more flavor available for tasting, and to assist such flavors in penetrating the taste buds more readily. Disodium inosine- 5•-monophosphate [IMP], disodium guanosine-5'-monophosphate [GMP] , maltol, and ethyl maltol are known as weak flavor enhancers.It is well known that the combination of monosodium L- glutamate [MSG] and a flavor inducing 5•-nucleotide, such as disodium inosine-5'-monophosphate [IMP], disodium guanosine- 5*-monophosphate [GMP], or mixtures thereof, exhibit a synergistic flavoring activity. Thus, with, the use of MSG, lower amounts of total flavor enhancers can be used at a reduced cost to the user. MSG itself is a powerful flavor enhancer and, with or without other flavor enhancers, is widely used as a flavor enhancer in the food industry. It is added to many processed foods and is available as a powder to be added to foods during home preparation. However, MSG can act as a vasodilator. As such, it is a common cause of headache in migraine prone individuals. It also frequently causes a sensation of fatigue, bloating, and gastric distress in sensitive individuals. Recent studies have also linked other health problems to overuse of MSG. There is a need for 

a non-toxic flavor inducing agent, especially one that will exhibit a synergistic effect with other flavor inducing substances, so that it may be used in very small quantities tc enhance the flavor of foodstuffs. It is known that silica in small amounts is present in some drinking waters. The silica is considered a natural mineral in such waters with no known adverse health effects. However, such waters do not demonstrate any flavor potentiating or enhancing properties. It is also known that water can be treated magnetically to modify the properties of such water, see for example, my U.S. Patent No. 4,888,113. However, while such magnetic treatment in some instances can improve the taste of water
