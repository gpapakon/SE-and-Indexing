<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in cement admixtures for 
hydraulic cement compositions such as mortars, grouts and concretes. More 
particularly, the invention relates to novel bughole-reducing admixtures, 
cement compositions containing them, and methods for making hardened 
cement articles having substantially bughole-free and clean outer surfaces. Many concrete structural units are precast formations made at a location 
away from the construction site. This is done to provide uniform and high 
quality concrete formations which are difficult to form in the field. The 
precast formations are delivered to the job site and installed as part of the 
structure being formed. Such formed concrete units include, for example, 
beams, columns, exterior panels, pipes and culverts, and the like. The 
formation of such precast structural units conventionally requires using forms 
which contact a major portion of the unit's concrete surface as it is being cast 
and cured. In addition, job-site formation of concrete columns and the like 
are prepared similarly. In recent years, more and more concrete structures are being left 
exposed as architectural surfaces. Thus, the appearance of these surfaces is 
becoming more significant, particularly for vertically formed surfaces where 
texture and absence of surface blemishes are parameters designed into the 
fabrication of the concrete. Concrete surfaces are also being required to be smooth and blemish free 
for integrity of the concrete, for protection of the embedded reinforcing steel, 
for uninterrupted flow of fluid over the concrete surface, and for avoiding 
collecting foreign material on the surface. These criteria are important where 
concrete is used in highway bridges and culverts, sewer pipe applications,  
 
food processing plants, in surfaces that are exposed to freeze-thaw 
environments, and anywhere that imperfections in the concrete surface 
reduce the durability and functionality of the concrete article. During the mixing of the components used to form hydraulic cement 
compositions, such as mortars (small aggregate such as sand, hydraulic 
cement such as Portland cement, water) and concrete (small aggregate, large 
aggregate such as gravel, cement and water), air is entrapped in the 
composition. In certain instances, known cement additives are incorporated 
into the composition to enhance one or more of its properties. However, 
some cement additives, such as naphthalene sulfonate-based 
superplasticizers, are known to also cause additional
