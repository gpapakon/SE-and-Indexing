<ABSTRACT>
An electronic mail system connected to a network includes a
section for converting an image of a document surface into

corresponding document image data, and a section for compressing
the document image data into compression-resultant image data.

The electronic mail system also includes a section for converting
the compression-resultant image data into corresponding image

data of a given electronic-mail format, a section for receiving
information of an electronic-mail destination address, and a section

for transmitting the image data of the electronic-mail format toward
the electronic-mail destination address via the network. The

electronic mail system may further include a section for receiving
image data in an electronic mail, a section for converting the

received image data into corresponding received image data of a
given facsimile format, a section for expanding the received image

data of the facsimile format into expansion-resultant image data, and
a section for printing the expansion-resultant image data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic mail system which can
handle image information.Japanese published unexamined patent application 2-172348
discloses a facsimile apparatus which includes an interface for
connection with a computer network, and a controller for enabling
an electronic mail to be outputted to the computer network via the
interface. The facsimile apparatus is also connected to a telephone
line to receive and output image information from and to the
telephone line. In Japanese application 2-172348, the electronic
mail outputted to the computer network represents a facsimile
transmission result report or a facsimile reception result report
rather than image information.United States Patent 5,479,411 discloses that voice, facsimile,
and electronic mail messaging is integrated in a system which
converts e-mail messages into voice-and-fax messages. An e-mail
message is parsed into voiceable, prose, segments and non-voiceable,
non-prose, segments. Prose segments are converted into
voice message segments via text-to-speech facilities. Each non-prose
segment is converted into a fax segment. Voice pointers to
fax segments are inserted into the voice message, in places
corresponding to the non-prose segments in the e-mail message. 
The voice file and fax file are then stored for subsequent delivery of
the message as an integrated voice-and-fax message. Conversion of
integrated voice-and-fax messages into e-mail messages is likewise
envisioned.WO9403994 discloses an automatically initiated
scanning system for sending image data as a FAX and/or E-MAIL.It is an object of this invention to provide an improved
electronic mail system as set out in claim 1. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of an electronic mail system
