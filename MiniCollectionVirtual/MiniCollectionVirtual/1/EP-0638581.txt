<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel
phosphonic diester derivatives.The phosphonic diester derivatives of the
invention are novel compounds not heretofore described in
the literature.GB-A-2220206 and EP-A-0273444 disclose pharmaceutically active carboxamide
compounds useful in treating hyperlipidemia.Benzothiazole phosphonic acid diester derivatives are disclosed in EP-A-0010120 as
calcium-antagonistic pharmaceuticalsUS-A-4434162 discloses a coronary vasodilating composition containing a therapeutically
effective amount of 4-(benzothiazol-2-yl)benzylphosphonic acid ethyl isopropyl ester.WO-A-93/23409 discloses phosphonic diester derivatives which have the effect of reducing
blood sugar and lipid levels and are useful for treating diabetes and various types of
hyperlipidemic diseases.The object of the invention is to provide
compounds of value as medicines as will be described
hereinafter.The present invention provides a phosphonic
diester derivative of the following general formula (1):
