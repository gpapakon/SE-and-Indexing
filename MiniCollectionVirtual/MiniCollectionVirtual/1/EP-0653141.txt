<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for handling calls to a terminal (MS) in a mobile telephone system of the kind in which the call is handled by an ISUP/IAM message which has a static relationship between the address (PRN) of the visitor location register (GLR-2) in the network in which the terminal roams, and the unique terminal identity (IMSI). If the visitor location register (GLR-2) has no data record relating to the unique identity (IMSI), an attempt is made to collect from the home location register (HLR-1) of the called subscriber the data that is required to complete the connection, this data being stored in the visitor location register (GLR-2). If the attempt is successful and the called subscriber is active, the connection is set up in a known manner with the aid of this data.

<DESCRIPTION>
A METHOD FOR HANDLING CALLS TO A NON-REGISTERED MOBILE SUB¬ SCRIBER IN A MOBILE TELEPHONE SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a method for handling calls to a non-registered terminal in a mobile telephone system, and then particularly in a system which operates without specific roaming numbers.BACKGROUND ARTA public mobile telephone system that is intended to cover a wide area requires the application of advanced procedures to enable a call to a roaming subscriber to be directed to that radio base station which is in contact with the mobile telephone of the subscriber at that moment in time. Since fixed telephone networks, ISDN-networks and possibly other public land mobile telephone networks may be involved in setting up a single call connection, it is important that each point in the system can be quickly provided with information relating to the whereabouts of the roaming subscriber.Consequently, comprehensive signalling is required in order to keep the information in the system current and up to date.Known mobile telephone systems are NMT (Nordic Mobile Tele¬ phone System) , TACS (Total AccessMobile Telephone System) and AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone Service) , all of which are based on analog techniques, and GSM (Group Special Mobile) , ADC (American Digital Cellular) and PDC (Personal Digital Cellular) . NMT and TACS are described for instance in CMS88 Cellular Mobile Telephone System, ERICSSON document EN/LZT 101908 R2, 1988, whereas the GSM-system is described in CME 20 System, ERICSSON document EN/LZT 120226 R2A, 1991. ADC is described in the standardization document EIA/TIA IS 54, 55 and 56 and the network part in PDC is described in the 

standard Internode Specifications for Digital Mobile Com¬ munications Network, Ver. 3.2.These mobile telephone systems use mobile services switching centres which are each connected to a number of radio base stations and which maintain contact with mobile subscribers roaming within the areas covered by said mobile services switching centres. These switching centres are connected to means, visitor registers, which keep an account of which subscribers are located within the service area of respective centres. The visitor location register may be common to a number of mobile services switching centres or each mobile services switching centre may be connected to an own visitor location register. A common visitor location register can cover the whole of a mobile telephone network.Each subscriber is registered in a register in the network in which

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A method for handling a call in a mobile telephone system of the kind in which a subscriber (MS) roaming in a network (NW2) outside the home network (NWl) is called with a message which includes the address (PRN) of a visitor location register (GLR-2) which serves at least one mobile services switching centre (MSC2A, MSC2B) in the network (NW2) in which the called subscriber (MS) roams, and further includes an identification number (IMSI) unique to said subscriber (MS) , despite the visitor location register (GLR-2) lacking the called subscriber data that is required to connect the call, characterized in that the visitor location register (GLR-2) collects the data from the data record of the called subscriber in his home location register (HLR-1) using the unique identification number (IMSI) as the address, and stores said data in the visitor location register (GLR-2) ; and in that paging of the called subscriber (MS) is then started, whereafter if the called subscriber (MS) answers the paging, the call is set up in a known manner.
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the address (PRN) stored in the home location register (HLR-1) contains solely the address to the visitor location register (GLR-2) ; and in that paging is carried out over all mobile services switching centres (MSC-2A, MSC2-B) connected to the visitor location register.
3. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the address (PRN) stored in the home location register (HLR-1) includes both the address to the visitor location register (GLR-2) and the address to the mobile services switching centre (e.g. MSC-2A) within whose service area the called subscriber roams; and in that paging is solely effected over this mobile services switching centre. 


4. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that said address (PRN) and said unique identification number (IMSI) in the IAM-message are collected from the data record of the called subscriber (MS) in the home location register (HLR-1) in which the subscriber is registered.
5. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the call is aborted when no response is received.
6. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that when no response is received to the global paging of a subscriber, the calling subscriber is sent a speech message informing him that the called subscriber cannot be reached and that the call will be aborted.
