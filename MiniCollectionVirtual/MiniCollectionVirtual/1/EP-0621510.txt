<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a transfer paper comprising a support coated on at 
least one side with a transfer layer having a thickness of not less than 

3 µm and at least one constituent layer; with the outermost layer of 
said transfer layer being a coated layer containing at least a pigment 

and a binder, and having in the part extending to the depth of at least 
3 µm below the surface the hole distribution characterized by having at 

least one peak which shows the average pore diameter within the range 
of 0.1 to 1.0 µm and the height ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/g with 

respect to the pore volume when measured with a porosimeter of mercury 
injection type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transfer paper for xerography
or thermal transfer printing and, more particularly, to a transfer
paper which can reproduce images of high quality almost equal to those
obtainable in photography and graphic arts when used in a color printer
or color copying machine of the type which utilizes a xerographic
process or a thermally fused ink transfer process.As for the transfer paper for xerography, non-coated papers such
as wood free paper have been prevailingly used. Even when
conventional coated papers for graphic arts including art paper are
used, however, high quality images cannot be obtained.As a reason for it, it can be thought that prior to thermal
fixation a satisfactory toner image can be obtained on art paper or
another coated paper since such paper can come into uniform contact with
a photoreceptor upon copying operation because of its very high surface
smoothness, but it becomes difficult for the paper upon thermal
fixation to retain the whole toner thereon because the surface layer of
the paper is too compact, and thereby part of toner is scattered.Further, ordinary coated papers for graphic arts are usually
insufficient in gas permeability, because various kinds of adhesives
are admixed in relatively large amounts with the intention of enhancing
the surface gloss after printing and securing the surface strength upon
printing.when a coated paper as described above is used as transfer paper
for xerography, it is known that the coated paper causes a so-called
blister phenomenon, or a phenomenon such that the coated paper cannot 
completely let out the vapor generated therein by its moisture being
quickly heated through the fixation with heating rollers, thereby
causing interlayer separation in the coated layer part or the raw paper
part. This blister phenomenon roughens images ( Japanese Journal of
Paper Technology, vol. 27, No. (1984), pp. 31-36).As preventive measures taken against the blister phenomenon, there
are known, for instance, the method of controlling both surface
roughness and air permeability to no more than 4,000 seconds (Tokko Hei
5-82939 and Tokko Hei 5-82940, wherein the term "Tokko" means "examined
Japanese patent publication"); the method of providing a coated layer
having a coverage rate of 2 to 5 g/m2 and a sufficient water vapor
transmission rate, which is controlled within the range of 50 to 500
g/m2 × 24 hours, bn each side of a raw paper having a limited air
permeability (Tokkai Hei 1-245265, wherein ther term "Tokkai" means
"unexamined

binder,
said coated layer having in the part extending to the depth
of at least 3 µm below the surface a hole distribution

curve having at least one peak showing average pore diameter
within the range of 0.1 to 1.0 µm and a height ranging
