<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor processing method is provided for growing a 
polycrystalline film by preferably chemical vapor deposition 

(CVD) from a suitable precursor gas or gases on a 
substrate which has been coated with seeds, preferably of 

nanocrystal size, of the semiconductor material. The 
structure of the nanocrystal seeds (not the substrate) 

serves as a template for the structure of the final 
polycrystalline film. The density of the seeds and the 

thickness of the grown polycrystalline film determine the 
grain size of the polycrystalline film at the surface of 

said film. Epitaxial CVD onto the seeds to produce the 
polycrystalline film avoids the recrystallization step generally 

necessary for the formation of a polycrystalline 
film, and thus allows for the growth of polycrystalline 

films at reduced temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to forming a layer of 
polycrystalline material on a surface of a substrate. More 
particularly, the surface is seeded with particles on which 
the polycrystalline layer is grown from an atmosphere in 
which the substrate is placed. The invention relates to a processing technique for growth 
of a polycrystalline film on a substrate, preferably for 
growth of a polycrystalline semiconductor film on a 
substrate. This invention addresses the problems in 
polycrystalline semiconductor processing. In many 
instances, it is desirable to grow a polycrystalline semiconductor 
film on a substrate which is thermally incompatible 
with the standard growth processes for said film. For 
example, polycrystalline Si CVD typically requires temperatures 
in excess of 600°C. A desirable substrate for the 
support of a polycrystalline Si thin film is glass, which 
is incompatible with temperatures above 580°C. Glass typically 
melts or decomposes at temperatures above 580°C. 
Typically the electrical properties of a polycrystalline 
semiconductor film are determined by the grain size and 
grain boundaries of the film. A process for growing a 
polycrystalline semiconductor film which lends control over 
the grain size of said film is desirable. In the case of 
some materials, e.g. SiC, useful to practice the present 
invention there are a number of possible crystal structures, 
and very little is known about for growing a 
polycrystalline film of a given crystal structure.  Prior art which addresses the problem of growing a 
polycrystalline semiconductor film on a substrate which is 
thermally incompatible with the standard film growth 
process have typically relied upon techniques which provide 
for local heating of the substrate in the region of film 
growth while not heating the substrate bulk. Suzuki, 
Lubben and Greene¹ have shown that Si CVD on an amorphous 
SiO₂ substrate below 580°C produces an amorphous Si film. 
However, if a pulsed UV laser is directed at the substrate 
during film growth, polycrystalline Si is grown at temperatures 
as low as 535°C. This process is an in situ laser 
annealing (ISLA) process. It is difficult to adapt this 
process toward growing a film on a large substrate, as high 
laser powers ( > 100 mJ/cm²) are required, implying that 
many lasers would be necessary to continuously illuminate 
even a moderate sized substrate with energy sufficient to 
achieve polycrystalline film growth. Conversely, it is 
possible to grow an amorphous semiconductor film at low
