<ABSTRACT>
A device (18) for producing index inserts has a processing station (21) by means of which processing procedures are undertaken on the index insert at each location which has the tab or later becomes a tab. Since this location in each case has a different separation from the upper or lower edge of the index insert from index insert to index insert within one set, the transport device (28) for the index insert is configured such that the index insert to be processed is stopped in the correct position and is subsequently transported further after the processing procedure. For this purpose, the transport device (28) manages without stop means, with the result that damage to the edges of the index insert is excluded.
