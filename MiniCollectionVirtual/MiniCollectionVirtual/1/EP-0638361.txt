<ABSTRACT>
A suspension of alumina gel obtained by dispersing alumina gel into pure water so that the concentration of 
alumina is in the range of 0.1-12 wt.% and an aqueous solution of metallic salt in which a compound of metal in 

VIA group and that of metal in VIII group are dissolved are mixed, and the resultant mixture is dried and hardened 
by evaporating the water while agitating the mixture, whereby these metal components can be supported effectively 

on the alumina gel up to a sufficiently high support quantity. This enables a high-performance catalyst composition 
constituting a catalyst the performance, such as activity, of which is superior to that of a hydrogen treated catalyst, and 

such as a conventional hydrodesulfurized molten catalysts to be obtained easily. When this catalyst composition is 
brought into contact with sulfur-containing hydrocarbon in the presence of hydrogen, hydrocarbons from which sulfur 

has been sufficiently removed can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
preparing a catalyst composition and to a process for
hydrodesulfurizing sulfur-containing hydrocarbons by using
the catalyst composition as a desulfurization catalyst.
Particularly, the present invention relates to a method of
preparing a highly active catalyst composition, which may
be advantageously used for the hydro-refining (for example,
hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation and
hydrogenation), particularly hydrodesulfurization, of
various hydrocarbons, for example, petroleum hydrocarbons,
such as naphtha fractions, kerosene fractions, gas oil
fractions, atmospheric residues, vacuum gas oils, vacuum
residues and light cycle oils, shale oils and coal-derived
oils. The present invention further relates to a
hydrodesulfurization process, wherein the catalyst
composition is used as a hydrodesulfurization catalyst, so
that various sulfur-containing hydrocarbons, such as the
above-described hydrocarbons containing organic sulfur 
compounds, can be desulfurized efficiently to give
hydrocarbons of high quality which contain sufficiently
reduced amounts of sulfur and nitrogen and are useful as
fuel oils or the feed oils in the following catalytic
processes.Recently worldwide environmental disruption has
become a serious problem. In particular, combustion of
fossil fuels, such as petroleums and coals, is accompanied
by the generation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur
oxides (SOx), which when released into atmosphere, make
acidic rain or acidic fog, to damage severely the natural
environment of forests, lakes and marshes. Also, SOx and
NOx, and further the particulates (such as the particulates
of soot, dust and mist) released with the combustion
exhaust are harmful to human bodies inhaling them. These
circumstances demand some -measure for as much reduction of
the release of these pollutants including SOx, Nox and the
particulates as possible.A common measure for reducing the SOx release is
an after-treatment following the combustion, i.e. flue gas
desulfurization, which however is impractical for moving
exhaust sources even if operable technically. It is
therefore desirable to reduce the sulfur content in fuels 
to a degree which no longer requires the flue gas
desulfurization.On the other hand, NOx occur necessarily even
from well denitrified fuels as far as air is used for
combustion, and the particulates also occur in a large
quantity depending on the kinds of fuels and the manners of
combustion, thereby necessitating exhaust gas treatments
