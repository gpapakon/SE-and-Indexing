<ABSTRACT>
The rate of flow of water from a subterranean 
formation into a wellbore penetrating the formation is 

decreased by forming a gel in the formation. The gel is 
formed by polymerization of a water-soluble vinyl monomer 

and at least one multifunctional vinyl monomer crosslinker, 
a monomer in the formation, using an azo initiator which is 

temperature activated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the treatment of a
subsurface earth formation which is penetrated by a
borehole and, more particularly, to a method of decreasing
the rate of flow of water from a subterranean formation into
a borehole which penetrates the formation.When performing various types of operations below
the surface of the earth a problem often encountered which
interferes with the operation is the undesirable flow of
water from a subsurface formation into a work space or
volume which penetrates the formation. Such operations can
include, but are not limited to, mining operations,
foundation construction, road and bridge construction, oil
production and similar operations which require excavation
into or penetration of earth structures having
permeabilities conducive to the flow of water.Various attempts have been made to terminate, or
at least reduce, such undesirable flows of water. The
solutions attempted have involved, among other things,
pumping unwanted water from the work space, erecting
barriers, e.g. a casing, at the interface between the space
and the formation to prevent the flow of water from the
formation into the work space, and decreasing the
permeability of the formation itself by introducing a
material, e.g. a grout, into the formation. It is well known that both oil and water are
produced during the ordinary recovery of oil from a
subterranean formation. If the ratio of water to oil, i.e.
the water-oil ratio or WOR, is low, then the produced water
can be handled and disposed of in manner which will not
unreasonably reduce the economic benefits derived from the
produced oil. In such instances, water control can simply
involve pumping the water from the well and storing or
otherwise disposing of it in some acceptable fashion.
However, if the WOR is so high that the various costs of
pumping, handling, storing and disposing of the produced
water exceeds the economic benefits of the produced oil,
then the well is either abandoned or an alternate water
control technique is employed.Another water control method is disclosed by
McLaughlin in U.S. Patent 3,334,689, wherein an aqueous
solution of a polymerizable composition containing a
monoethylenically unsaturated acrylate monomer and a
crosslinking agent are injected into the formation producing
the water. The monomer and crosslinking agent are caused to
form a stable crosslinked gel in the formation to thus
reduce 
the water permeability of the formation and thereby terminate
or at least decrease the rate of flow of water from the
formatio
