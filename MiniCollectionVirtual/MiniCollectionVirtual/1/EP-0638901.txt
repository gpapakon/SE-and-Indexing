<ABSTRACT>
A disk cartridge includes a cartridge 
body, a shutter, a shutter lock 

member and a write-protect member. 
The cartridge body stores a rotating disc-like 

recording medium, and has a radial 
slot to expose part of the medium for 

recording/reproduction. This cartridge 
body comprises a pair of halves made, as 

a whole, of a transparent synthetic resin 
material. The shutter is movably fitted to 

the cartridge body and opens and closes 
the slot for recording/reproduction. The 

shutter lock member is disposed inside 
the cartridge body, engages with the shutter 

at the position at which the shutter 
closes 
the slot, and keeps the shutter at 
this closing position. The shutter lock 

member is made of a transparent synthetic 
resin material as a whole. The 

write protect member is movably disposed 
inside the cartridge body, and is 

operable from outside. It is made of a 
transparent synthetic resin as a whole.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a disc cartridge containing an 
information recording medium capable of recording information 
signals, such as an optical disc or a magneto-optical disc. 
More particularly, it relates to a disc cartridge having a 
cartridge main body molded from a transparent synthetic resin. In general, with a disc cartridge containing an information 
recording medium capable of recording information signals, such 
as music signals or video signals, e.g. an optical disc or a 
magneto-optical disc, scratches formed on or dust and dirt 
affixed to the surface of the information recording medium render 
it impossible to record or reproduce information signals. For 
this reason, the disc cartridge is provided with a shutter 
movably mounted on a main cartridge body for opening and closing 
a recording/reproducing aperture. The disc cartridge having such 
shutter member is provided with a shutter lock member for 
normally holding the shutter member at a position of closing the 
recording/reproducing aperture. The shutter lock member is rotatably supported on a 
supporting shaft set upright at a front side corner of the lower 
half of the disc cartridge. The shutter lock member has a 
pivotal supporting portion having an opening traversed by a 
supporting shaft, a lock arm portion having an engagement recess 
engaged with an engagement lug formed on the shutter member, and  
 
an elastic displacement portion protuberantly mounted from the 
pivotal supporting portion for facing the lock arm portion. When the disc cartridge is inserted into the 
recording/reproducing apparatus, the shutter lock member has its 
lock arm portion elastically displaced and run into partial 
rotation by a shutter opening member provided on the 
recording/reproducing apparatus. As a result, the engagement lug 
of the shutter member is disengaged from the engagement recess 
for unlocking the shutter member closing the 
recording/reproducing aperture. When the disc cartridge is 
further intruded into the recording/reproducing apparatus from 
the state of unlocking of the shutter member, the shutter member 
is moved in a direction of opening the recording/reproducing 
aperture for opening the aperture. Consequently, the shutter 
lock member, performing such elastic displacement or partial 
rotation, is formed of a polyacetal resin having superior sliding 
wear characteristics, spring characteristics or creep resistance. The disc cartridge has a mistaken recording inhibiting 
mechanism for inhibiting destruction or

<CLAIMS>
A disc cartridge comprising: 
   a cartridge main body made up of a pair of cartridge halves 

formed in their entirety of a transparent synthetic material, 
said cartridge main body having a disc-shaped recording medium 

rotatably contained therein and including a recording/reproducing 
aperture for exposing at least a portion of the recording medium 

contained therein to outside along its radius, a shutter mounted 
for movement on said cartridge main body for opening and closing 

said recording/reproducing aperture, and 
   a shutter lock member formed in its entirety of a 

transparent synthetic material, said shutter lock member engaging 
with and holding said shutter at a position of c
losing said 
recording/reproducing aperture by said shutter. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
transparent synthetic material of said upper and lower cartridge 

halves and the shutter lock member is a polycarbonate resin. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 1 wherein said 
shutter lock member comprises a support portion supported within 

the cartridge main body and an elastically deflectable arm 
portion formed integrally with said support portion and having 

an engagement portion engaged with said shutter. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 1 wherein the 
mistaken recording inhibiting member formed in its entirety of 

a polycarbonate resin is mounted for movement in the cartridge 
main body and mounted so as to be operated from outside of the 

cartridge main body. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 1 wherein the shutter 
 

is formed of an opaque material. 
A disc cartridge comprising 
   a cartridge main body made up of a pair of cartridge halves 

formed in their entirety of a transparent synthetic material, 
said cartridge main body having a disc-shaped recording medium 

rotatably contained therein and including a recording/reproducing 
aperture for exposing at least a portion of the recording medium 

contained therein to outside along its radius and a detection 
opening for indicating whether or not recording of information 

signals on the disc-shaped recording medium contained therein is 
possible, and 

   a mistaken recording inhibiting member movably mounted in 
said main cartridge body and including an operating portion 

having at least its portion exposed to outside via an operating 
opening formed in a lateral surface of said cartridge main body, 

an opening/closure portion for opening and closing said detection 
opening, and a holding portion operated by said operating portion 

for holding said opening/closure portion at a first position of 
closing said detection opening and a second position of opening 

said detection opening, said operating portion, opening/closure 
portion and the holding portion being formed integrally of a 

transparent synthetic material. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 6 wherein the 
transparent synthetic material of the upper and lower cartridge 

halves and the mistaken recording inhibiting member is a 
polycarbonate resin. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 7 wherein the holding 
portion of said mistaken recording inhibiting member has a pair 

 
of arm portions holding a guide portion formed for being 

protruded into one of the upper and lower cartridge halves. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 6 wherein one of the 
operating portion and the closure portion of the mistaken 

recording inhibiting member is colored. 
The disc cartridge as claimed in claim 6 wherein said 
operating portion of the mistaken recording inhibiting member has 

an index indicating the longest recordable time on the disc-shaped 
recording medium contained in the disc cartridge.
