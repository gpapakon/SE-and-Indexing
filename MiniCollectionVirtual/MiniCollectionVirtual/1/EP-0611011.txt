<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for repressing NOx 
formation and controlling flame shape and characteristic 

in a regenerative burner during combustion. The 
regenerative burner having heat storage units (216,216') with 

combustion effluent/combustion air ducts therethrough, 
fuel intake means (205) and a burner (204). 

The burner may provide for staged combustion, 
either by means of sequential fuel injection or 

sequential provision of combustion air, or the burner may 
repress NOx formation by vitiation of combustion air with 

products of combustion. The regenerative burner may also 
include an interconnecting duct (224) communicating with the 

burners having a coaxial gas nozzle (222) for injecting a high 
kinetic energy gas stream into the exhausting hot flue 

gas to induce a portion of the hot flue gas into the 
interconnecting duct to pass the hot flue gas t
o the 
firing burner for vitiation purposes thereby repressing 

NOx formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to generally regenerative 
type burners for heating a furnace, and more particularly 
to regenerative burners with minimized NOx formation in 
the ultimate combustion effluents. Regenerative-type burners for furnaces are 
well-known in the art in varied forms and designs, but 
they share the common feature whereby heat storage units 
are provided to withdraw and store heat from hot 
combustion effluents known as flue gas, with subsequent 
transfer of the heat to preheat incoming combustion air. 
The earliest regenerative-type furnaces were symmetrical 
arrangements having both burner(s) and heat storage units 
(often solid structural arrays of "checker chamber" 
bricks) in place on each of two sides of the furnace. 
Firing of such a regenerative furnace began with the 
burner(s) on one side, with concomitant storage of the 
heat present in the combustion effluents by the heat 
storage units on the second side. After optimal heating 
of the heat storage units, or the "checker chamber," the 
air flow in the furnace was reversed to draw combustion 
air in through the checker chamber, thus preheating the 
combustion air. Ducts in the checker chamber thus 
alternately conveyed combustion products and combustion 
air, and the burners functioned alternately as burners 
and as flues. Modern regenerative systems do not involve 
complete symmetrical furnaces but instead include 
specialized regenerative burners employed, typically, in 
pairs. Each of the paired regenerative burners is 
equipped with heat storage units, ordinarily in the form 
of compact regenerative beds, through which combustion 
air passes en route to the burner. Because the burners 
are employed in pairs, one burner is fired at a time 
while the other functions as a flue and heat storage bed. 
Then every 20-120 seconds or so, flow in the furnace is  
 
reversed and the burners "exchange" functions, that is, 
the first-fired burner becomes the flue gas exhaust/heat 
storage bed as the second burner fires. A system 
exemplary of one paired burner arrangement is found in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,522,588. A persistent problem with regenerative systems 
involves the extremely high NOx concentrations inevitably 
present in the combustion effluents, produced as a result 
of the extremely high air preheats and flame 
temperatures, as well as through fuel bound nitrogen. As 
a result, regenerative systems which historically enjoyed 
industry-wide acceptance now cannot meet the emissions 
standards in an ever-increasing number of
