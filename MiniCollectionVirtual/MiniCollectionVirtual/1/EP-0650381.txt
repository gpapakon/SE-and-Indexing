<ABSTRACT>
There is described a method of characterisation of cardiac electrophysiological behaviour for identifying patients at risk of sudden death from arhythmias, for example associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Paced ventricular electrograms are analysed, and latency values of transitions of the electrograms are used to construct conduction curves. Parameters of the curves such as the point of onset of a predetermined increase in latency and the increase in electrogram width in a predetermined interval during the pacing sequence are used to identify and/or characterise physiologically significant features of myocardial disarray.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Characterisation of Intraventricular ConductionThe invention relates to a method of characterisation of intraventricular conduction, and in particular to the detection and characterisation of electrophysiological effects of myocardial disarray on intraventricular conduction.Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common cause of sudden death other than by accident amongst people under 35 years old. One of the features of HCM in patients who are at risk is myofibrillar disarray, i.e. changes in the normal structure of the heart muscle, which is often accompanied by variation in cell diameter. This gives rise to scar tissue which causes thickening of the ventricle wall. These changes cause changes in intraventricular conduction behaviour, creating a number of different potential conduction paths between a paced and a recorded site within the ventricle. Conduction may then be dispersed which can indirectly give rise to uncoordinated contraction of the heart muscles in ventricular fibrillation. Such abnor¬ mal rhythms, or ventricular arrhythmias, are thought to be one factor involved in sudden death from HCM. However, a large number of patients with HCM are not at risk of sudden death. It is therefore desirable to be 

able to identify those patients who are at risk.Myofibrillar disarray may be expected to cause slow conduction between a paced and a recorded site within the ventricle due to an increase in the number of potential conduction paths between the sites, and vary¬ ing utilisation of the respective paths. Accordingly the demonstration of slow conduction may be useful in indicating patients at risk of sudden death.According to the invention there is provided a method of characterisation of cardiac electrophysio- logical behaviour by analysis of paced ve tricular elec¬ trograms, in which method latency values of transitions of the electrograms are used to construct conduction curves, selected parameters of the curves being used to identify and/or characterise physiologically-significant features of myocardial disarray.The pacing electrode may be located at one of the right ventricular apex, the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), the right ventricular inferior wall and the right ventricular septum. Electrograms may be recorded at each of the other sites.The pacing sequence may be computer generated. Preferably there is used a decremental sequence, which 

may consist of a 480 millisecond drive chain with an extrastimulus applied every third beat, followed by immediate continuation of the drive
