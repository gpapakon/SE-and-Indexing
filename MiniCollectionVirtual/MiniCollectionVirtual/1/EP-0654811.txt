<ABSTRACT>
An improved color picture tube (8) includes an 
evacuated envelope (10) having a rectangular faceplate panel 

(12). The panel includes a viewing screen (22) on an inner 
surface thereof and a mask-frame assembly (24, 25) mounted 

therein. The mask-frame assembly includes a shadow mask (24) 
attached to a peripheral frame (25). The improvement comprises 

the frame comprising a box-like enclosure that extends around 
the periphery of the mask. The frame material has approximately 

the same thickness as does the shadow mask material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color picture tubes of the 
type having shadow masks attached to frames that are suspended 
in relation to cathodoluminescent screens, and particularly to an 
improved, lighter-weight mask-frame assembly. As the sizes of color picture tubes have increased, 
there has been a corresponding increase in the sizes and weights 
of tube components. One of these components is the mask-frame 
assembly. Present color picture tubes use steel frames to support 
shadow masks within faceplate panels of the tubes. One type of 
frame is made from a continuous piece of L-shaped steel, that is 
bent and welded to itself at its ends. Another type of frame is 
formed by pressing a flat steel sheet into the shape of the frame. 
Typically, tubes have frames that are made from materials that 
are from about 1.00 mm (0.039 inch) thick to about 1.51 mm 
(0.062 inch) thick. The frames are usually rectangularly shaped 
and supported within faceplate panels by three or four springs 
that are attached to the sides of the frames; alternatively, the 
frames may be supported at their four corners. Embodiments for 
achieving such corner support are shown in U.S. Patent 4,723,088, 
issued to Sone et al. on February 2, 1988, and in U.S. Patent 
4,728,853, issued to Sone et al. on March 1, 1988. Because of the considerable weight of a conventional 
mask-frame assembly, there is an opportunity to reduce the 
overall weight of the tube, if the need for a support frame can be 
eliminated. The present invention provides a shadow mask 
assembly that utilizes a very lightweight frame. An improved color picture tube in accordance with the 
present invention includes an evacuated envelope having a 
rectangular faceplate panel. The panel includes a viewing screen 
on an inner surface thereof and a mask-frame assembly mounted 
therein. The mask-frame assembly includes a shadow mask 
attached to a peripheral frame. The improvement comprises the 
frame including a box-like enclosure that extends around the 
periphery of the mask. The frame material has approximately the 
same thickness as does the shadow mask material.  In the drawings:

<CLAIMS>
A color picture tube (8) including an evacuated 
envelope (10) having a rectangular faceplate panel (12), said 

panel including a viewing screen (22) on an inner surface thereof 
and a mask-frame assembly (24, 25; 36; 48) mounted within said 

panel, said mask-frame assembly including a shadow mask (24; 
46) attached to a peripheral frame (25; 38; 50); characterized in 

that said frame (25; 38; 50) forms a box-like enclosure around the 
periphery of said mask (24; 46), and said frame has 

approximately the same thickness as does said mask. 
The tube as defined in Claim 1, characterized in 
that said frame (25) is formed from two pieces (30, 31) that are 

L-shaped in cross-section and are welded together to form said 
box-like structure. 
The tube as defined in Claim 1, characterized in 
that said frame (38) is formed from two pieces (40, 42) which 

form box-like structure that is triangular-shaped in cross-section. 
The tube as defined in Claim 1, characterized in 
that said frame (50) is formed from a single piece which is bent to 

form a box-like structure that is rectangularly-shaped in cross-section.
