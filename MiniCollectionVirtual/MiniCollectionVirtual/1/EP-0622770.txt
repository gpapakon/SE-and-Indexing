<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle simulator is provided with a control device (10) for actuation 
by an operator which device's input is digitised (12) and fed to a vehicle 

model (14). The model (14) maintains an objective position and direction for 
the simulated vehicle which are fed to a lag means (16). The lag means 

operates to delay the rate of change of objective direction of the simulated 
vehicle to provide a subjective direction to a display generator (18). The 

display generator (18) provides a subjective view based on the objective 
position and subjective direction of the simulated vehicle on a display (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a simulation arrangement and more 
particularly to a fixed-bed vehicle simulation arrangement in which the 
operator is not physically moved around by the arrangement. 
One such simulation arrangement, in accordance with the 
preamble of claim 1, is disclosed in EP-A-0 404 381. Fixed bed simulators for training and entertainment purposes such as 
flight simulators and video games for driving are available at a variety of 
levels of sophistication. The crudest simulators provide the operator with a 
view from the vehicle which is merely translated in space relative to the 
previous view. More sophisticated simulators such as that described in Van 
Winsum, W., "GIDS Small World Simulation" Chapter 9 in Michon, J.A., 
"Generic Intelligent Driver Support", Taylor and Francis, London also rotate 
the view to provide the operator with an objective view from the simulated 
vehicle. Such simulators provide a much more realistic output to the operator 
than the crudest types of simulator. However, they are not as realistic (or as 
expensive) as a full simulator which moves the operator around. One difficulty that has arisen in the development of a fixed-bed 
simulator which both rotates and translates the view provided to the 
operator is that the operator sees a situation that does not correspond to 
what he feels. This anomaly can cause feelings of nausea in the operator. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fixed-bed 
simulation arrangement which results in reduced feelings of nausea in the 
operator. According to the present invention there is provided a vehicle 
simulation arrangement comprising display means for displaying a view from 
a simulated vehicle to an operator, at least one control device for actuation 
by an operator, means responsive to the at least one control device for 
maintaining an objective direction of the simulated vehicle, characterised in 
that lag means are provided for delaying the objective direction of the 
simulated vehicle before it is applied to the means for displaying a view from  
 
the simulated vehicle. The provision of a delay between the objective direction of the 
simulated vehicle and the direction of view actually provided to the operator 
means that the simulation apparatus does not always show the operator a 
view looking along the vehicle axis as is done in known systems and this is 
found to be less nausea-inducing. A simulation apparatus in accordance with 
the invention has also been found to be easier to
