<ABSTRACT>
A system for processing a high definition television 
signal includes a codeword prioritizer (30-34, 40-44) responsive 

to a codeword datastream derived from an MPEG-like encoder. 
The prioritizer generates a flag to indicate a breakpoint between 

high priority and standard priority codewords within a given 
image data group. Null codewords (26) are inserted into the 

codeword datastream during intervals when the prioritizer is 
analyzing codewords to determine where to establish the priority 

breakpoint. The null codewords are ignored by a following 
transport processor (50) which packs codewords into cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns apparatus for processing a
coded video signal. In particular, this invention concerns
apparatus for prioritizing a video signal subjected to variable
length coding (VLC) according to the MPEG standard.US patent 5,122,875-Raychaudhuri et al. describes a
system for processing a high definition television (HDTV) signal
subjected to MPEG-like variable length coding. MPEG is a
standardized coding format being established by the International
Organization for Standardization. The standard is described in the
document "International Organization for Standardization,"
ISO/IEC DIS 11172, Coding for Moving Pictures and Associated
Audio for Digital Storage Media, Rev. Nov. 23, 1991, which
document is incorporated herein by reference for description of
the general code format. The Raychaudhuri system includes a
priority selector which separates codewords into high and low
priority codeword sequences. The high and low priority codeword
sequences correspond to compressed video data of relatively
greater and lesser importance to image reproduction, respectively.The priority selector analyzes codewords in order to
calculate a breakpoint between high and low priority segments for
a given image slice. As will be seen, a "slice" is an image segment
corresponding to one of the layers of the MPEG coding syntax. The
codeword datastream is then passed to a transport processor
which packs the codeword data into transport cells each including
header and payload sections, and which provides output HP and
SP datastreams.It is herein recognized as desirable for a priority
selector unit in a data prioritizing system to exhibit synchronous
operation so as to simplify timing requirements, e.g., by requiring
only a single clock. In addition, it is herein recognized as
desirable for the priority selector to process the codeword
datastream without rendering the datastream incompatible with a 
standard data format, such as MPEG, when the prioritized data is received
and packed by a transport processor prior to an output channel.According to the present invention, there is provided apparatus for
facilitating the segmentation of a codeword datastream into first and second
prioritized codeword sequences in a video signal processing system, said
apparatus including:
means for providing a video signal codeword datastream comprising a
succession of data groups and for providing a length word concurrently with
each codeword of said video signal codeword datastream, said length word
designating the bit length of the

Apparatus for facilitating the segmentation of a codeword datastream
into first and second prioritized codeword sequences in a video signal

processing system, said apparatus including:

means (14) for providing a video signal codeword datastream
comprising a succession of data groups and for providing a length word

concurrently with each codeword of said video signal codeword datastream,
said length word designating the bit length of the associated codeword;
codeword processing means (30-36, 40-44) including analysing means
(42), said analysing means (42) being responsive to said codeword datastream

and being operative during an analysis interval for determining a priority
breakpoint between codewords within a data group;
transport processor means (50) for receiving an output codeword
datastream from said codeword processing means, and for formatting said

output codeword datastream into said first and second prioritized codeword
sequences for transmission via first and second prioritized data channels;
said apparatus being characterized by:
means (26) for generating null codewords during said analysis intervals,
said null codewords being codewords with a length of zero; and
means (28) for inserting said null codewords into said video signal
codeword datastream.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that

said video signal codeword datastream provided by said providing
means (14) exhibits a standardized coding format such as MPEG; and
said transport processor means (50) ignores said null codewords in the
process of packing codewords into data cells for transport.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that

said video signal is a television signal containing image information
constituted by a plurality of image frames each comprising a plurality of

image slices; and
said analysis interval encompasses an image slice interval.
Apparatus according to claim 1, and further characterised by

translating means (14) for providing a translated version of an MPEG-coded
video signal to said codeword processing means (30-36, 40-44); and
inversely translating means (48) for providing an MPEG-coded video
signal to said transport processor.
