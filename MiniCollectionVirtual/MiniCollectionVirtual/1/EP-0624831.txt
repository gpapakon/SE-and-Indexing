<ABSTRACT>
A control system is proposed which is to be used in conjunction with fluid-actuated systems. It has a valve station (4), which contains a plurality of valves (13) and valve drives (35), which are allocated to the said valves and can be actuated electrically with the cooperation of an electronic control unit (24). In addition, it is equipped with at least one signal connection (72) for a signal conductor (34) leading away from the valve station (4). At least one signal connection (32) is the input (32') and/or output (32'') of a signal transducer (37, 38), which is a component of the valve station (4). The relevant signal transducer (37, 38) is capable of converting ingoing non-electrical control signals into electrical signals which can be processed by the control unit (24), and/or vice versa.

Control device for use in connection with fluid-operated
equipment (2), such as working cylinders, with a valve station

(4) comprising several valves (13) and valve drives (35) associated
therewith and electrically controllable with the aid of an

electronic control unit (24), and equipped with at least one
signal port (32) for a signal conductor (34) leading from the

valve station (4) to an external object, said at least one signal
port (32) permitting the input of control signals from the object,

characterized in that the at least one signal port (32) is
the input (32') of a signal converter (37) forming part of the

valve station (4) and converting the incoming non-electrical
control signals into electrical signals which can be processed

by the control unit (24).
Control device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the valve station (4) is equipped with at least one signal converter

(38) with at least one signal port (32) serving as output
(32') and converting the electrical signals influenced by the

control unit (24) into outgoing non-electrical control signals.

several carrier modules (47) can be fitted to the valve station

(4) in a consecutive row.
Control device according to Claim 9 or 10, characterized in
that at least one carrier module (47) is an output module (50)

fitted exclusively with signal ports (32) designed as outputs
(32).
Control device according to any of Claims 9 to 11, characterized
in that at least one carrier module (47) is an input module

(49) fitted exclusively with signal ports (32) designed as
inputs (32').
