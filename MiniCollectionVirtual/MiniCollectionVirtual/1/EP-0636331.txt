from the spinning pack 1, whereby the spinning pack 1 is
provided with a resin flowpath changeover unit 2 and a

multi-hole nozzle plate 3 which are superposed, and the
resin flowpath changeover unit 2 is connected to the

extruders 6A, 6B by means of the communicating pipe lines
5A, 5B disposed at symmetrical positions in the

longitudinal direction, and main flowpaths 7A, 7B for
directly connecting the zone flowpaths 9A, 9B communicating

with each communicating pipe line 5A, 5B and a plurality of
branch flowpaths 8A, 8B connected with the main flowpaths

7A, 7B in crosswise manner are combined to be provided on
an almost entire surface of the resin flowpath changeover

unit 2, and each zone flowpath 9A, 9B is independently

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to colored doormats, a method
of manufacturing doormats and a doormat manufacturing
device in which the doormats, usually placed before a door
or other entrance of a building or a house, for scraping
mud or dirt from the shoes, and particularly, such doormats
are formed of numerous synthetic resin monofilaments in
random loops form, and such numerous synthetic resin
monofilaments are respectively colored, and these colored
synthetic resin monofilaments are combined with colored
monofilaments of two colors or more than two colors to
produce mottled doormats or a striped doormats whereby
attractively colored doormats having decorative effect or
attraction of beauty are available.Heretofore, many a mat which is produced by
accumulating synthetic resin monofilaments in random form
have been known. However, the conventional doormat of this
kind is not colored or decorated with a pattern, and the
entire mat is formed in monochrome, and as a result, such
mat is an extremely short of attractive power from the
standpoint of shadings of color, multi-coloration.US-A-3.836.416 discloses a mat having two laminated
sheets comprising loops of thermoplastic material
monofilaments, wherein one of the two sheets has one color
and the other sheet has another color. An object of this invention is to provide doormats
which are formed by accumulating numerous synthetic resin
monofilaments in random loops and combining the colored
synthetic resin monofilaments with colored synthetic resin
monofilaments of two colors or more than two colors whereby
mottled or striped doormats are available.The present invention thus provides a doormat of the type
consisting of a plurality of random loops formed from mutually
fused extruded synthetic resin monofilaments forming an
integral units, and comprising loops of monofilaments of at
least two different colors according to claim 1.Another object of this invention is to provide a doormat
manufacturing method and a doormat manufacturing device, in
which in order to produce mottled or striped doormats, numerous
synthetic resin monofilament are accumulated in random
loops by combining the colored synthetic resin
monofilaments colored in two colors or more than two
colors, and a spinning pack of plane rectangular shape for
spinning numerous synthetic resin monofilaments comprises a
resin flowpath changeover unit and a multi-hole nozzle
plate, and the resin flow path changeover unit is provided
with communicating pipelines 5A, 5B, ... at symmetric
positions in

<CLAIMS>
A doormat of the type consisting of a plurality of
random loops formed from mutually fused extruded synthetic

resin monofilaments (A,B) forming an integral unit,
the doormat comprising loops of monofilaments

of at least two different colors (A,B), characterised in that loops of
different colors are either randomly entangled with each

other in order to provide a mottled pattern of the mat,
or are arranged so that loops of one color form a stripe

in a fixed width and loops of another color form an adjacent stripe
in a fixed width in order

to provide a striped color pattern.
The doormat of claim 1, characterised in that it
comprises a surface layer, a middle layer and a bottom

layer, wherein the shape of loops are different in each
layer.
A method of manufacturing a multicolor doormat
comprising providing a spinning pack (1) of a plane

rectangular shape for spinning a large number of
monofilaments with a resin flowpath changeover unit (2) and

a multi-hole nozzle plate (3), provided with a plurality of
nozzle holes (10), whereby by means of the changeover unit different

groups of nozzle holes are connected through different
communication pipelines to different extruders of different

colors, forming a plurality of groove-shaped zone flowpaths
mutually independently which communicate with each

communicating pipe line on an almost entire surface of the
resin flowpath changeover unit, feeding molten resin

colored in mutually different colors from each extruder, so
as to spin monofilaments of different colors from said

different groups of nozzle holes, disposing a collecting belt 
supported on a pair of belt wheels rotating in the same

direction in the lower part of the spinning pack, and

middle layer of the doormat by accumulating the colored

monofilaments spun from the spinning pack sequentially to
receive them on the surface of the forming roll arranged

beneath said nozzle holes, forming a surface layer of the
doormat with the loops of irregular three dimensional curve

on the middle layer by accumulating the colored
monofilaments on the water level at a position lower than

the point of accumulation of the monofilaments of the
bottom and middle layers of the surface of the forming

roll, and forming an integrated doormat by mutually fusing
