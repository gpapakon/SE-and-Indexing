<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to piezoelectric pressure 
control valves. More specifically, the invention relates to 
a valve used in conjunction with a system, such as an anti-lock 
braking system, which requires high frequency actuation 
capabilities. The piezoelectric effect was discovered by Jacques and 
Pierre Curie in 1880. They found that certain materials 
deform when exposed to an electrical field. This has become 
known as the inverse piezoelectric effect 
t. The effect is practically linear, i.e., the deformation 
varies directly with the applied potential difference. It 
is also direction-dependent, so that if the material is 
exposed to an electric field, it will experience an elastic 
strain which causes its length to increase or decrease 
according to the polarity of the field. This behavior is 
manifest in such materials as piezoelectric ceramics, which 
are hard, chemically inert, and completely insensitive to 
humidity and other atmospheric influences. As an example of harnessing piezoelectric phenomena, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,690,465, which issued on September 1, 
1987, discloses an anti-skid hydraulic pressure modulator 
for a vehicular hydraulic braking system. The system 
includes a piezoelectrically operated pressure modulator, 
including a passage which is opened and closed by a 
piezoelectric actuator. The piezoelectric element expands 
and contracts almost instantaneously in response to voltage 
application and voltage drop. However, in such systems, 
responsiveness is limited in operation by a shut-off valve 
being positioned either in an "on" or "off" position. Such 
systems do not exhibit a continuously controlled modulation. An anti-lock brake system is one example of a device 
which may be controlled by a pressure control valve. 
Illustrative of other such devices are vehicular 
transmission systems, engine intake and outlet valves, and 
suspension systems. In the past, the effectiveness of such 
devices has been limited by the inherent sluggishness or  
 
delay with which fluid flow, for example, changes in 
response to a sensed condition (such as applied brake pressure). A member component of most piezoelectric pressure 
control valves is a movable spool and seat made of a 
silicious material such as 
silicon. Electrically activated, normally closed diaphragm 
valves have been fabricated using heated bi-metallic 
diaphragms to provide the operating force. Such valves have 
been designed to provide proportional control of flows at 
various input pressures. The valves are
