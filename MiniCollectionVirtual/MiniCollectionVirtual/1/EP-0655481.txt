<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of an aqueous
dispersion which is autocrosslinking at room

temperature, having an MFT of from 0 to 50°C, by
mixing at least one carboxyl-containing, soft latex

polymer A having an MFT of below 20°C and at least
one hard latex polymer B having an MFT of above

25°C and also at least one polyfunctional carboxylic
hydrazide C, the ratio of A to B being from

70:30 to 30:70, and the latex polymer A being
prepared by emulsion polymerization of one or more

monomers from each of the following groups:

a) from 99 to 60% by weight of acrylic esters,
methacrylic esters, styrene and styrene derivatives,
b) from 0.5 to 5% by weight of α,β-unsaturated
monocarboxylic acids and α,β-unsaturated

dicarboxylic acids,
c) from 0.5 to 30% by weight of carbonyl-containing
α,β-unsaturated compounds, and
d) from 0 to 5% by weight of α,β-unsaturated
carboxamides

and the latex polymer B being prepared by emulsion
polymerization of one or more monomers from each of

the following groups:

a) from 99.5 to 70% by weight of acrylic esters,
methacrylic esters, styrene and styrene derivatives, 
b) from 0.5 to 5% by weight of α,β-unsaturated
monocarboxylic acids and α,β-unsaturated

dicarboxylic acids,
c) from 0.5 to 10% by weight of carbonyl-containing
α,β-unsaturated compounds, and
d) from 0 to 5% by weight of α,β-unsaturated
carboxamides, and the molar ratio of the hydrazide

groups introduced via C to the sum of the
carbonyl groups introduced into A and B via

monomers c) being from 1:10 to 10:1.
