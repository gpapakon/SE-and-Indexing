<ABSTRACT>
MOSFETs and IGBTs contain parasitic structures (bipolar transistors or thyristors) which can be switched on, for example when short-circuiting the load. The component can be destroyed by this. Switching on of the parasitic structures is substantially suppressed in that the heavily doped contact zone (6) producing a local short circuit between the emitter zone (7) and the base zone (6) has a lateral separation of between 0 and 1  mu m from the gate electrode. The lateral voltage drop below the emitter (7) (source) is thereby kept very low, and the voltage across the pn junction between the emitter and the contact zone remains less than approximately 0.5 V.
