<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the invention is a folding bellows (1) for installation between vehicles (6,7) which are connected to one another in an articulated fashion, in particular articulated buses. The floor (5) of the tubular folding bellows (1) is an independent assembly which is assigned in an easily detachable way to the tunnel-shaped bellows component consisting of roof (2), side walls (3,4) and communication arc (14). Means which produce a particularly expedient connection between the communication arcs (14) at the lower ends of the side walls (3,4) and the floor (5) of the bellows are indicated. Here, the floor (5) of the bellows is to be small in terms of height or thickness and capable of being installed at a low level above the surface of the road.

A bellows (1) for installation between two
pivotably connected vehicles (6, 7) and, in the

installed state, forming a peripherally closed tube
surrounding a gangway floorplate with a roof (2), side

walls (3, 4) and floor (6), characterised in that the
tube is in two parts, the upper part (2-4) in the

peripheral direction consists of the roof (2) and side
walls (3, 4) as a unit and the lower part consists of a

sub-assembly which can be independently installed and
dismantled and constitutes the floor (5) and is

connected by releasable fastening means to the side
walls (3, 4) in the region of the lower ends thereof so

that after the sub-assembly forming the floor has been
associated, the peripherally closed tube is formed, the

connection being such that even in these regions no
environmental influences can reach the interior of the

bellows (1).
A bellows according to claim 1, the bellows cross-section
in the installed state having the shape of an

upright rectangle with rounded corners, characterised
in that the side walls (3, 4) of the bellows end at the

lower ends in transitional curves (14), and the ends
thereof remote from the side walls (3, 4) are

releasably connected to the bellows floor (5) forming a
sub-assembly.
A bellows according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the bellows (1) in the region of the roof (2)

and the side walls (3, 4) has the same distance between
the inner and outer bellows edges or fold edges (11,

12) and the thickness of the bellows floor (5) is 
considerably less than the distance between the inner

and outer bellows edges (11, 12) in the region of the
roof (2) and side walls (3, 4).
A bellows according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the bellows floor (5) is in the

form of a corrugated bellows (16, 17).
A bellows according to claim 4, characterised in
that the corrugations in the bellows floor (5) formed

by the web (17) of material of the bellows (16, 17) are
inwardly curved.
A bellows according to any of claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that folds of the bellows extend from

the free end of one lower transitional curve (14) over
the adjoining side wall (3, 4), the roof (2) and the

other side wall (4, 3) continuously to the free end of
the other lower transitional curve (14) and an

intermediate fold is disposed between each pair of
successive aforementioned folds in the region of the

lower transitional curves (14).
A bellows according to claim 3, characterised in
that the bellows floor (5) has a number of rods (170),

the rods (170) being disposed parallel to one another
and the rods (170) following one another in the

longitudinal direction of the bellows (1).
A bellows according to claim 7, characterised in
that the rods (170) are axially symmetrical. 
A bellows according to claim 7, characterised in
that the cross-sections of the rods (170) form ellipses

with their major axes on edge.
A bellows according to claim 8 or 9, characterised
in that the rods (170) are hollow profiles.
A bellows according to any of claims 7 to 9,
characterised in that a cloth (21) is smoothly

stretched between the free ends of the lower
transitional curve (14) and the rods (170) are passed

through loops (22) associated with the cloth.
A bellows according to claim 11, characterised in
that the cloth (21) is uniform with the material of the

bellows roof (2), the bellows side walls (3, 4) and the
transitional curve (13, 14) and is a rubber-coated

fabric but is intrinsically elastic.
A bellows according to claims 4 and 5,
characterised in that edge profile rods (16) hold

together individual webs of the bellows (5) which are
curved upwards with an approximately semicircular

cross-section between each pair of edge profile rods
(16).
A bellows according to claim 13, comprising edge
profile rods (16) which extend from the free end of a

lower transitional curve (14) to the free end of the
other lower transitional curve (14) and hold together

webs of bellows forming turn-over edges, characterised
in that the edge profile rods (16) of the 
bellows floor
(5) are releasably connected to second end formations 

(11a) on the first outer clamping strips of the roof
(2) and side walls (3, 4).
A bellows according to claim 14, characterised in
that the bellows webs of the bellows side walls (3, 4)

or their lower transitional curves (14) extend away
over the second end formations (11a) in the region of

the lower transitional curves (14) and abut the
underside of the webs (17) of material of the bellows

floor (5) and are tightly but releasably connected
thereto.
A bellows according to claim 15, characterised in
that the tight but releasable connection is made by a

Velcro fastener.
