<ABSTRACT>
In particular for pneumatic robot spot-welding guns, a control system is designed in such a way that the welding gun is held in slanting positions with a supporting force in a welding-gun carrier (14) by a control cylinder (11) and an associated piston rod (12). The supporting force corresponds to the weight component of the welding gun. The welding gun is preferably supported relative to the welding-gun carrier (14) in a working position inclined to the normal position by a pressure cushion in a pressure chamber (8) and by a pressure cushion with a pressure controlled as a function of inclination in a compensating chamber (6 or 7) in connection with a pressure piston (12a) and a compensating piston (12b) on the piston rod (12) fastened to the welding-gun carrier (14).

Welding gun comprising welding gun control means, in particular pneumatic 
robot-type spotwelder, the welding gun being supported in its fixture at a 

welding gun bracket (14) by means of a controlling pressure cylinder (11) 
and of an associated piston rod (12) in such manner that the supporting force 

corresponds to the weight force component of the welding gun in positions 
which deviate by inclination from a standard horizontal or vertical position. 
Welding gun according to claim 1, wherein in a working position inclined 
relative to the standard position, the welding gun is propped against the 

welding gun bracket (14) by a pressure cushion in a pressure chamber (8) 
and by a pressure cushion in a balancing chamber (6 or 7) under 

inclinationcontrolled pressure, in combination with a pressure piston (12a) 
and a balancing piston (12b). 
Welding gun according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein at a welding gun 
casing, a controlling cylinder (11) made up of to pneumatic cylinders (11a, 

11b) is axially shiftable along a piston rod (12) attached to the welding gun 
bracket (14), the piston rod (12) comprising two pistons (12a, 12b) of which a 

face of a primary pressure piston (12a) in a pressure chamber (8) receives 
compressed air fed from a compressed air line (10) during the return stroke 

of the welding gun cylinder, while either face of a secondary pressure piston 
(12b) in balancing chambers (6, 7) receives compressed air through 

checkvalves (1a, 1b) from an air pressure line (9) during the power stroke of 
the welding gun cylinder via compressed air lines (15a, 15b) loaded 

according to the welding gun inclination under control of a pendulum weight 
(4) by means of a pendulum lever (13) borne in a pivot bearing (5) and of a 

transverse pin (13a), diaphragm boxes (3a, 3b) and shafts (2a, 2b). 
Welding gun according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein for detecting the 
welding gun's angle of inclination, a potentiometer at a pivot axis of the 

welding gun bracket (14) is arranged to determine by its measuring value, via 
a servomotor, the opening angle of a reducing valve whose outlet is 

adjustable to the two balancing chambers (6, 7) through a two-way magnetic 
valve, depending on the measuring range section.
