<ABSTRACT>
New types of modified gelatins are disclosed, modified at part 
of the free carboxyl groups of the polypeptide chain, by the 

introduction of a new end-standing amino, sulphinic acid or thiol 
group. The modified gelatins show an enhanced reactivity towards 

vinylsulphonyl hardeners. The invention further includes hardened 
modified gelatin types and hydrophilic elements containing them. In 

particular, a differentially hardened multilayer element, preferably 
a photographic element, is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new types of modified gelatin
and to multilayer hydrophilic elements, in particular photographic
elements, containing such a new type of modified gelatin.In conventional photographic materials gelatin still is the most
commonly used hydrophilic binder in the photosensitive and non-photosensitive
hydrophilic coated layers. As well known to those
skilled in the art gelatin is prepared from collagen. Details on the
preparation of gelatin are described in e.g. "the Science and
Technology of Gelatin", A.G. Ward and A. Courts, Academic Press
1977, p. 295. Gelatin consists of a three-dimensional network of
polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide chain is built-up by repeating
units of about twenty different amino acids linked together by
peptide bonds. The dicarboxylic amino acids, i.c. aspartic acid and
glutamic acid, provide the free (unbonded) carboxyl groups in the
polypeptide chain, while the free amino groups are provided by amino
acids, containing more than one amino group, e.g. lysine and
arginine. Free carboxylic groups and free amino groups can act as
so-called functional groups in several chemical reactions, e.g.
modification reactions and hardening reactions. The ratio of free
carboxylic and free amino groups determines the so-called
isoelectric point, the pH at which the gelatine molecule is
electrically neutral. Low isoelectric point gelatines and high
isoelectric point gelatines exist depending on the chemical
treatment (acid or alkaline) of the collagen of which they are
derived.In order to be easy to handle without risk to physical damage
photographic materials have to be appropriately hardened. Hardening
agents include those of the epoxide type, those of the ethylenimine
type, chromium salts e.g. chromium acetate and chromium alum,
aldehydes e.g. formaldehyde, glyoxal, and glutaraldehyde, N-methylol
compounds e.g. dimethylolurea and methyloldimethylhydantoin, dioxan
derivatives e.g. 2,3-dihydroxy-dioxan, active vinyl compounds e.g.
1,3,5-triacryloyl-hexahydro-s-triazine, active halogen compounds
e.g. 2,4-dichloro-6-hydroxy-s-triazine, and mucohalogenic acids e.g. 
mucochloric acid and mucophenoxychloric acid. These hardeners can be
used alone or in combination. The binders can also be hardened with
fast-reacting hardeners such as carbamoylpyridinium salts as
disclosed in US 4,063,952.Usually the hardening reaction implies an intra-molecular and/or
inter-molecular cross-linking of polypeptide chains. The hardening
agents can be built-in in the polypeptide network
