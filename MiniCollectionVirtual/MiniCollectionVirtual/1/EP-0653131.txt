<ABSTRACT>
A communication system (100) segments a field of data such that segments of data are transmitted in their own timeslot with their own control field. The communication system (100) segments the field of data into segments of data, adds control to the timeslot in a field designated for user information, and transmits the segmented data and control during the timeslots to a receiving unit. A receiving unit receives the timeslot, stores the segment of data representing a segment of the field, and recombines the segments to produce the field of data. If a retransmission is requested by a receiving unit, the transmitting unit need only retransmit the single timeslot containing the segment of data received in error. There is never a need to retransmit multiple timeslots since, in effect, each timeslot contains a discrete segment of the field of data.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONVEYING A FIELD OF DATA IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEMField of the InventionThe invention relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to conveying fields of data in a communication system.Background of the InventionDigital communication systems, such as time division multiplexed (TDM) communication systems, require transmission on a given radio frequency (RF) carrier signal during timeslots. Transmission of voice information does not present a problem in the system since a particular coding rate (and consequently a time duration) is chosen to sufficiently meet the time constraints of the TDM timeslot. However, when large, multi-slot messages are required to be transmitted during a timeslot where the timeslot size is small in comparison to the message, problems are introduced into the system. Since the messages typically are generated at a particular layer of the communication system (where a layer is a convenient separation between functions pertaining to different levels of a communication system), typical solutions involve a segmentation scheme at a particular layer (say layer n) above the air interface, or data link layer.Such schemes are inadequate for two reasons. First, they recode the original message into multiple data link layer messages, each of size less than one timeslot. In order for a layer 

at a receiving unit to reassemble the message, layer n information is passed with each timeslot transmitted. Consequently, the resulting number of bits that are required to be transmitted is increased by the number of bits in a layer n header multiplied by the number of segments (or timeslots) needed to transmit the message. Second, if the layer n message fails to transmit correctly, the layer n entity has no recourse but to retransmit the entire message, including all of the timeslots required to transmit the message. Since the timeslot channel is a high bit error rate environment, retransmission of the entire message may, and does, frequently occur.The Pan-European Digital Cellular (PEDC) system designated group special mobile (GSM) is a layered protocol which attacks the above problem by only allowing a window size of one to be used. This is essentially an acknowledge /no-acknowledge protocol for control functions. In user data service applications, GSM has a layer 2 function run from a subscriber unit to an interworking function for data services. As such, it does not have a true point-to-point layer 2 function which exists from the subscriber unit to a
