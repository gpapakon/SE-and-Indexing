<ABSTRACT>
A peak hold circuit 11 holds a peak value of an 
output signal from a rotating angle sensor 6. A bottom 

hold circuit 12 holds a bottom value of the output signal 
from the rotating angle sensor 6. A threshold value is 

set from the peak value by the peak hold circuit 11 and 
the bottom value by the bottom hold circuit 12 by 

resistors 24 to 27, analog switches 28 and 29 and a NOT 
circuit 31. A comparator 10 compares the output signal 

of the rotating angle sensor 6 with the set value thus 
set, and outputs a binary signal (digitized signal) in 

accordance with the comparison result.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sensor signal 
processing unit according to the preamble of claim 1. A sensor signal processing unit corresponding to the 
preamble of claim 1 is, e.g., known in the art front JP-A-61 
091 770, JP-A-04 069 986 and US-A-4 665 318. For example, 
the sensor signal processing unit disclosed in JP-A-61 091 
770 comprises a peak hold means for holding a peak value of 
an output signal of a sensor and a bottom hold means for 
holding a bottom value of the output signal of the sensor; 
furtheron, there is provided a threshold value setting 
circuit for setting a threshold value from the respective 
peak value and the respective bottom value. The respective 
output signal of the sensor is compared with the respective 
threshold value set by the setting circuit so as to output 
a binary signal in accordance with the comparison result. The processing unit of JP-A-61 091 770 is provided for 
a sensor which, basically, is delivering a signal in the 
form of square-wave, i.e. a bi-level or binary signal. If 
the respective sensor, however, delivers an output signal 
which is rather a continuously varying signal, such as a 
sine wave or a triangular wave, the known circuit will provide 
an output signal the binary information of which most 
probably will not correspond to the binary information of 
the sensor signal. For example, the known signal processing 
unit will not be able to produce a correct binary signal 
from a sensor signal having the waveform as shown under 
"IN" in Fig.2 of the present invention. The same disadvantage 
holds true with the signal processing units known US-A-4 
665 318. The signal processing unit known from JP-A-04 069 986 
is provided for the detection of the revolution of a rotary 
member by using  
 
a magnetoresistance element (MRE) (for example a 
ferromagnetic thin film resistor). When a gear-like 
rotary member rotates, the direction of a magnetic flux 
passing through the MRE changes, so that the output of 
the MRE also changes. The 
revolution of the rotary member is detected by digitizing the output 
change and effecting an appropriate signal processing. In order to convert the wave-like output from the MRE to 
a digital output, or in other words, to digitize the 
output, the reference described above employs the 
following method to determine a threshold value. Namely, 
the method sets in advance the threshold values (an upper 
limit value S1 and a lower threshold value S2) of a 
binary pulse-forming comparator as digitization means, 
and
