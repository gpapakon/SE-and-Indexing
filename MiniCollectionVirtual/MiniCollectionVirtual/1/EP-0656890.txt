<ABSTRACT>
A method for chemically synthesising the various optical forms of ergothioneine, essentially comprising the steps of preparing or using an optionally optically active N alpha ,N alpha -dimethylated histidine ester salt; treating this compound with an aryl, alkenyl or alkyl halogenothionoformiate in the presence of a base; protecting the sulphur substituent of the resulting compound and converting said compound into a compound such as trimethylammonium; and releasing the desired ergothioneine by saponification or acid hydrolysis as appropriate. An improved yield and an excellent optical purity may thus be achieved.

-dimethylated histidine ester salt,
optically active if necessary ;
b) treating this compound, with an alkyl, alkenyl or aryl
halothionoformate, particularly a phenyl halothionoformate, in the presence

of a base;
c) after protecting the sulphur substituent of the compound
obtained, converting the latter compound into a trimethylammonium-type

halothionoformate, particularly a phenyl halothionoformate, in the presence

of a base ;
c) protecting the sulphur substituent, preferably by acylation, more
preferably by means of an alkyl or phenyl haloformate, in the presence of a

base, preferably triethylamine;
d) treating the resulting protected compound with a methylating
agent, preferably with a methyl halide in an alcohol ; and
e) releasing the D,L-ergothioneine by saponification, preferably by
means of an amine in a water/alcohol mixture.
A method of chemical synthesis of L-(+)-ergothioneine,

that the above-mentioned acidic hydrolysis is carried out in the presence of a

mercaptan, particularly for obtaining L-(+)-ergothioneine.
The method according to claim 4, characterised in that the
mercaptan is selected from an alkyl mercaptan or an aryl mercaptan, or β-mercaptopropionic

acid.

-C
6

out in a polar solvent and preferably in two steps, advantageously in a first
step a weak base is used preferably having a pKa of less than about 9,

particularly a bicarbonate, advantageously in the presence of a polar solvent
which favours the solubility of the chlorothionoformate, for example ethyl

ether ; and in a second step another base is used, preferably a base the pKa of

advantageously an amine- or alkylamine-type base, particularly diethylamine
or triethylamine, and advantageously in the presence of a polar solvent,
