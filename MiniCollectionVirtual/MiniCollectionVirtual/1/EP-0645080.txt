system to manage and control a fish breeding plant, in 

cooperation with fish breeding tanks and within those 
tanks, the device (10) being positioned substantially 

vertically and comprising a first upper chamber (23a) and a 
second lower chamber (23b), the first upper and second lower 

chambers (23a-23b) being separated by partition baffle means 
(24-26) defining an acceleration slit (25), the first upper 

chamber (23a) having at its upper upstream end an adjustable 
weir (18) and in its upper downstream portion a shut-off 

wall (15), the second lower chamber (23b) having in its 
lower upstream portion a closure wall (14a) and in its lower 

downstream portion at least one transit gap (22), delivery 
means (28) to diffuse oxygen being included in the lower 

portion of the second lower chamber (23b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device to oxygenate fish 
breeding plants, as set forth in the main claim. The oxygenation device according to the invention is 
employed in the tanks of fish breeding plants and, in 
particular, for the breeding of trout so as to ensure at all 
times a sufficient content of uniformly diffused oxygen in 
the water within the tanks. The state of the art discloses fish breeding plants 
comprising a plurality of substantially rectangular tanks 
placed side by side, into which water is run. The water is 
generally taken from a stream or spring and runs by gravity 
from one tank to the next one before being discharged 
thereafter into the stream downstream. The change-over of water has to be continuous so as to 
ensure that its oxygen content is greater than a minimum 
limit value, which is about 6% and is needed to ensure the 
survival and proper growth of the fish. When there is a lack of water due, for instance, to the 
dry season or to exhaustion of the spring, the changing of 
the water is no longer ensured and the oxygen content of the 
water in the tanks falls below the pre-set minimum value. For this reason attempts have been made to increase the 
oxygen content of the water by direct injection of oxygen 
into the tanks. This system of direct injection of oxygen has been 
employed successfully in the lorries which convey live fish 
but does not achieve the desired purpose in breeding tanks. In fact, seeing that the breeding tanks are of great sizes 
with a width of about 10 metres, a length of 200 metres or 
more and a depth of water of 1.2 to 1.5 metres, the oxygen 
cannot be diluted and distributed evenly.  Trials have also been made with surface delivery means and 
aerators, but the outcome has been very disappointing. In fact, the traditional oxygen injection systems entail 
the problem that the oxygen injected does not become diluted 
enough in the water and does not become evenly distributed 
over the whole tank. It has been found that the oxygen content is greater than 
the required minimum only in the neighbourhood of the oxygen 
injection chamber and that the content drops quickly below 
the threshold value to be ensured as soon as the water 
departs from the injection chamber. The oxygenation methods of the state of the art therefore 
do not enable the required minimum oxygen content to be 
ensured where fresh water is limited and, above all,where 
the breeding plant works with a closed circuit with 
continuous re-circulation of the same water and the addition 
of
