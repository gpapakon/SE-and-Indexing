<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fluid collection apparatus, such as
non-refluxing suction canister systems.During operative surgery and other medical and biological procedures,
suction canister systems are used to collect fluids from a patient, including blood,
saline, and any other fluids which may accumulate or must be removed and
contained during the procedure and disposed of after the procedure. The
collection system uses suction canisters and a vacuum source. While a single
canister can be and are often used, a multiple canister suction system will be
described because the use and operation of a single canister system is apparent
from that for a multiple system. Multiple canisters are arranged in tandem with
a first canister having a suction tube to collect fluids from a source and to deposit
the fluids in the first canister. Downstream canisters are coupled together with
their vacuum sources applied in series or in parallel from a vacuum source
connected at the end canister.Typically, a canister unit includes an open-top cylindrical canister closed
by a cover or lid to which is sealed an internal liner to be contained in the
canister. Vacuum is applied through the canister wall to the space or cavity
between the liner and the canister wall to expand the liner outwardly into contact
with the canister wall. Vacuum is also applied for each canister to a vacuum
port in the lid to develop a subatmospheric pressure or vacuum within the liner,
which vacuum then also develops at the collection tube at the desired level.
Tandem tubes connect the interior of the liner of the first canister to the inlet 
port on the lid of the next succeeding canister so that when the first canister fills,
fluid in the first canister thereafter passes to the second canister, and so on.The lid typically includes several access ports with associated attachment
or connection elements. A vacuum port accepts a tube from the vacuum source
to apply vacuum internal to the liner. An inlet or patient port accepts one end of
the suction tube. A large access port is typically capped until a fluid setting
agent such as Isolizer is to be added. An outlet or "ortho" port includes a wider
riser portion than the patient port for connection of a suction tube during
orthopaedic operations or for connection of a tandem tube for connecting an
additional collection canister to the first. The vacuum port of each canister
includes a float valve to prevent withdrawal of fluids into the vacuum system.
However, the other ports in the lid which are

<CLAIMS>
A fluid collection apparatus comprising a flexible fluid collection
reservoir (60) which has a length between an open end, secured to and

closed by a cover (62), and a closed opposite end, a container body (48)
closable by the cover (62) with the reservoir housed in the body, refining

means for connecting the cover with the body, and means (58) connectable
to a vacuum 
source for producing a vacuum between the reservoir and the
closed body, so that the reservoir forms a liner within the body;

   characterised in that the connection between the cover and the
container body is breakable by fluid pressure within the reservoir acting

on the cover after removal of the vacuum, whereby the cover is lifted off
the container body, and the reservoir has a longitudinally expandable

portion (64), which permits longitudinal expansion of the reservoir to
contain the fluid.
The apparatus of Claim 1 wherein the reservoir (60) includes a
surface forming a seal with the cover (62).
The apparatus of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the expandable portion (64)
includes a plurality of circumferentially, disposed pleats.
The apparatus of Claim 3, wherein the container body (48) includes
a bottom and wherein the circumferencially disposed pleats are positioned

closer to the cover (62) than to the bottom of the body (48).
The apparatus of Claim 3 or 4, wherein the pleats are formed so as
to permit approximately half or a fifth again as much volume to be added

to the reservoir (60) in an expanded configuration relative to an unexpanded
configuration. 
The apparatus of Claim 3, 4 or 5, wherein the pleats are arranged
axially relative to one another.
The apparatus of any preceding claim further comprising an inlet
port (46) in the cover (62) and a one-way valve (78) for the inlet port for

allowing fluid flow into the reservoir (60) but substantially preventing
fluid flow out of the reservoir (60).
The apparatus of Claim 7 wherein the one-way valve (78) includes
a flapper valve (84).
The apparatus of any preceding claim further comprising a second
fluid collection reservoir, having an inlet port (74) and a conduit (52)

fluidly connecting the reservoir (60) in the first container body (48) with
the reservoir of the second container body (50).
The apparatus of Claim 9 wherein the fluid conduit (52) is locked in
place on the cover (62) for the first container body (48).
The apparatus of Claim 9 or 10, further comprising a closeable
valve (136) between the first and second container bodies (48,50).
The apparatus of Claim 11, wherein the closeable valve (136) is
positioned in the fluid conduit (52) between the first and second container

bodies (48,50). 
The apparatus of Claim 11 or 12, wherein the closeable valve (136)
is held open while the fluid conduit (52) is connected between the first and

second container bodies (48,50).
The apparatus of Claim 11, 12 or 13, wherein the closeable valve
(136) includes a flapper valve.
The apparatus of Claim 14 further comprising a wiper valve (144)
for substantially preventing loss of fluid upon disconnection of the fluid

conduit (52) as the flapper valve (142) is closing.
The apparatus of Claim 15 wherein the second container body (50)
includes a connection riser to which the fluid conduit (52) is connected, a

connection housing (138,140) to enclose the riser and part of the fluid
conduit (52), wherein the flapper valve (142) and wiper valve (144) are

retained within the housing, the flapper valve (142) is held open when the
housing and riser are connected, and wherein the wiper valve (144) is

positioned between the flapper vale (142) and the exposed end of the
housing such that, when the fluid conduit (52) is connected to the second

container body (50), the wiper valve (144) is positioned between the
flapper valve (142) and the second container body (50).
The apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein the first container
body (48) is rigid and the reservoir (60) of the first container body (48)

has a shape generally conforming to said first body (48) when said cover
(62) covers an opening of the first body (48) and the vacuum in the cavity

is present. 
The apparatus of Claim 1, wherein the expandable portion (64) is a
bellows.
