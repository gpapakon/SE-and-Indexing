<ABSTRACT>
A connection device for making a hydraulic 
connection comprising a male connector (4), a female 

connector (2) adapted to receive the male connector so as 
to allow fluid communication therebetween, and a 

retaining staple (6) for retaining the male connector 
within the female connector. The retaining staple 

comprises two arms (32) connected together at one end 
thereof, and the female connector defines two 

passageways (24) adapted to receive the two arms of the 
retaining staple, the arms being adapted, when received 

within said two passageways, to engage with the male 
connector so as to retain the male connector within the 

female connector. At least one of the arms (32) is 
provided with a locking recess (38) or projection adapted 

to engage with the male or female connector in such a 
way as to allow removal of the locking staple, when the 

connection device contains hydraulic fluid under 
pressure, only after movement of the male connector 

further into the female connector against the action of 
the hydraulic fluid under pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to hydraulic connection 
devices, and particularly to hydraulic connection devices 
for use with hydraulic equipment in underground mines. A known connection device for making a hydraulic 
connection comprises a male connector adapted to be 
connected to an end of a hydraulic hose, a female connector 
adapted to receive the male connector, and a retaining 
staple for retaining the male connector within the female 
connector. The female connector may be connected to, or 
form part of, a piece of hydraulic equipment. 
Alternatively, two female connectors may be arranged back-to-back 
to form a double female connector which can be used 
to connect two hydraulic hoses, each provided with a male 
connector, together. In either case, the female connector 
comprises a generally cylindrical bore for receiving the 
generally cylindrical male connector. Furthermore, the 
female connector is provided with two passageways arranged 
perpendicular to, and intersecting with, the cylindrical 
bore. The male connector is provided with an annular 
circumferential groove which aligns, and intersects with, 
said two passageways when the male connector is inserted 
into the female connector. The male connector is retained 
within the female connector by passing the two arms of the 
staple through the two passageways formed by the female 
connector, so that the two arms engage within the annular  
 
groove of the male connector. In order to ensure that the staple remains in 
position once inserted into the two passageways of the 
female connector, the two arms of the staple, which are 
generally parallel, are shaped so as to curve slightly away 
from one another at their free ends. The two arms of the 
staple must therefore be pushed slightly together before 
insertion into the two passageways of the female 
connector. However, once the free ends of the arms of the 
staple emerge from the other ends of the two passageways 
of the female connector, the two free ends of the two arms 
of the staple are free to move part slightly, thus 
retaining the staple in position. The pressures used for hydraulic equipment can be 
considerable, and it can therefore be highly dangerous to 
remove the staple while the fluid within the connection 
device is under pressure. This is particularly hazardous 
in view of the fact that the male and female connectors are 
made of metal and can be of substantial weight. If a 
staple is removed while a hydraulic hose is under pressure, 
the male and female connectors may fly apart

the male connector further into the female connector 
against the action of the hydraulic fluid under 

pressure. 
A connection device as claimed in claim 1, 
further comprising resilient means (8) for biasing the 

 
male connector away from the female connector even when 

there is nu hydraulic pressure within the connection 
device. 
A connection device as claimed in claim 2, 
wherein the resilient means is a wave washer (8). 
A connection device as claimed in claim 2 or 
claim 3, wherein retaining means (40) are provided for 

retaining the resilient means either within the female 
connector or on the male connector. 
A connection device as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein said recess (38) or 

projection is provided on both arms (32) of the 
retaining staple. 
A connection device as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein at least one arm of the 

retaining staple is provided with a part circular recess 
(38) of complementary shape to, and adapted to receive, 

a portion of a cylindrical surface extending around the 
male connector. 
A connection device as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein said two passageways (24) 

intersect with a bore (20) within the female connector 
adapted to receive at least a portion of the male 

 
connector. 
A connection device as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the two arms (32) of the 

retaining staple are generally parallel to one another. 
A connection device as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein at least one of the arms 

(32) of the retaining staple is provided with a tapered 
or pointed free end so as to facilitate insertion of
