<ABSTRACT>
A chondroprotective agent comprising a carboxylic acid 
compound of the general formula (I): 


wherein R¹ and R² are, independently, a hydrogen atom or an 
alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a cis- or trans-isomer 

thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester 
thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is 

disclosed. The above compound strongly inhibits proteoglycan 
depletion from the chondrocyte matrix and exhibits a function 

to protect cartilage, and thus, is extremely effective for 
the treatment of arthropathy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an agent for protecting 
cartilage, i.e., a chondroprotective agent, more 
particularly, a chondroprotective agent containing a 
carboxylic acid compound of the general formula (I) as 
mentioned below or a cis- or trans-isomer thereof, or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof. There are various types of arthropathy, for example, 
rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic fever, and osteoarthritis. 
Many people particularly suffer from rhematoid arthritis and 
osteoarthritis. These diseases have been studied as the 
major types of arthropathy. There are congenital and 
secondary osteoarthritis, and further primary osteoarthritis 
caused by degeneration of the articular cartilage along with 
aging. Patients suffering from primary osteoarthritis have 
recently been increasing along with the increase in the 
population of the aged. Although there are considerable differences of the 
causes and conditions between rheumatoid arthritis and 
osteoarthritis, the articular function becomes eventually 
obstructed by the destruction of the cartilage in both of 
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The first choice of medicines for the treatment of 
rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic 
fever, systemic lupus erythematosus, and osteoarthritis are 
analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents, for example, aspirin 
or indometacin. Further, gold compounds such as Shiosol, 
immunomodulators, steroids, or D-penicillamine are used as 
medicines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The above conventional analgesic and anti-inflammatory 
agents, however, were not effective against the destruction 
of the articular cartilage, and in fact, sometimes exhibited 
adverse effect in experiments using chondrocytes. Further, 
no inhibitory effect on the destruction of articular  
 
cartilage was observed in the above medicines for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is known that caffeic, ferulic, isoferulic, or 3-ethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic 
acid may be used in the following 
pharmaceutical applications: Caffeic and ferulic acids 
exhibit an antiviral activity [Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 4-234319]. Caffeic acid may be used 
as a calcium antagonist [Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 4-243822], an anti-allergenic agent 
[Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 59-155314], 
and the like. Caffeic acid and methyl caffeate can 
be used for the treatment of autoimmune disorders 
(WO91/17749). Further, ferulic and
