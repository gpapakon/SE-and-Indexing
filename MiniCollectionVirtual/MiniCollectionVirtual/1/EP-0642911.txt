A molding apparatus for molding screws of a synthetic resin comprises upper mold members (2 and 4), lower 
mold members (3 and 5), and four sets of slide cores (2a, 4a, 3a, 5a), respectively, supported by these mold members

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of molding
screws of a synthetic resin and a molding apparatus for
carrying out the method.Screws made of a synthetic resin are not only remarkably
light in weight in comparison with screws made of a metal and
can be mass-produced, but also their production cost is
relatively low because their material is relatively
inexpensive. In addition, they can be easily produced with
different pitches and/or different thread shapes in section.
Therefore, they have been increasingly widely utilized as
being incorporated in various feeding devices.For example, paper sorters operatively associated with
copying machines are required to incorporate such a mechanism
that can move a number of vertically disposed sorter trays
successively to their prescribed positions so as to bring
them to be in spaced arrangement or to be collected at a
bottom position, or can broaden the spacing between adjacent
sorter trays on the side of the copying machine at which
copied papers are discharged than on the other side, and
synthetic resin-made screws are utilized in this mechanism. 
Synthetic resin-made screws are also used in various devices,
such as the zoom mechanisms of cameras or the head
transporting mechanisms of printers.If upper and lower molding blocks are used to mold such a
synthetic resin screw by means of a cavity the center axis of
which lies in a parting plane formed between the upper and
lower molding blocks, it will be difficult to withdraw a
molded screw longer than one pitch from a mold assembly.
Specifically, if the molded screw is observed from one side
thereof along its horizontal axis, by noting either one of
the side faces (flights) of a particular thread, it can be
seen that a top half which corresponds to an angular extent
of 90째 (a 1/4 pitch of the thread) above the center line is
visibly exposed, i.e., the top half is in the "non-undercut
state" in which the molded product can be withdrawn from the
mold assembly in the direction of the eyes. Further, it will
be seen that a bottom half which follows the top half and
corresponded to an angular extent of 90째 below the center
line is not visibly exposed, i.e., the bottom half is in the
"undercut state" in which no molded product can be withdrawn
from the mold assembly.Further, another top-half side face which is opposite to
the non-undercut side face of the thread above the center
line is in the undercut state. By noting the opposite side 
faces of two adjacent threads formed on the opposite sides of
a particular
