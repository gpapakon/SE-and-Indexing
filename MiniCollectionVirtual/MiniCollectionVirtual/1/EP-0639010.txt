<ABSTRACT>
Each path is identified by a delay (D1, D2) which is applied to at least one spreading sequence in order to determine a correlation between the received signal and the said spreading sequence. For each selected delay (D1, D2) a reception energy (E1, E2) contained in the CDMA signal consisting of the correlation between the received signal (r) and a reference spreading sequence (CP) is evaluated. Delays to be tested (D) are selected at random with a probability of choice which exhibits a maximum for a delay substantially equal to the smallest of the selected delays (D1). The delays (D) thus chosen are tested by evaluating their associated reception energy (E). When the reception energy for a tested delay is greater than at least one of the reception energies associated with the previously selected delays, the tested delay is substituted with that one of the previously selected delays for which the reception energy is lowest.

A method for selecting multiple propagation paths
retained for receiving mess
ages transmitted in a code-division
multiple access (CDMA) radiocommunication system,

each path being identified by a delay (D1, D2) which is
applied to at least one spreading sequence for determining

a correlation between the received signal and said spreading
sequence, wherein, for each selected delay (D1, D2), a

reception energy (E1, E2) contained in a CDMA signal
consisting of a correlation between the received signal (r)

and a reference spreading sequence (CP) is estimated, and
wherein other delays (D) are successively tested by

estimating the reception energy (E) for each tested delay
and, when the reception energy for a tested delay is greater

than at least one of the reception energies associated with
the previously selected delays, said tested delay is

substituted for the one of the previously selected delays
for which the reception energy is the lowest,

characterized in that the tested delays (D) are
randomly chosen with a choice probability having a maximum

for a delay substantially equal to the smallest of the
selected delays (D1).
A method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the law of the choice probability of the tested delays

is approximately an elevated Rayleigh function.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the law of the choice probability of the tested

delays has a peak about the value of the smallest of the
selected delays (D1), the time width (L) of said peak being

between 5 and 20 µs.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the tested delays (D) are randomly

chosen in a time window of predetermined width (ΔT), the
position of said window being defined with respect to the

value of the smallest of the selected delays (D1). 
A method according to claim 4, characterized in
that the ratio between the maximum probability of choice for

a delay in the window and the minimum probability of choice
for a delay in the window is between 5 and 15.
