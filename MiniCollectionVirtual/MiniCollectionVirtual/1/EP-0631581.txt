<DESCRIPTION>
Intermediates and a Process for Synthesis of Tetrahydropteridine C6-Stereoisomers, Including (6S)-Tetrahydrofolate and N5-Formyl-(6S)-tetrahydrofolate.Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to intermediates and a process for the preparation of tetrahydropteridine C6-stereoisomers.Background-Discussion of Prior ArtThere is a great need for tetrahydropteridine C6-stereoisomers. For example, N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolic acid (also known as ieucovorin) is being used to potentiate the effects of 5-fluoro-uracil in the treatment of several forms of cancer. Another use is the regime of Ieucovorin "rescue" following high dose methotrexate in cancer chemotherapy or for immunosuppression. Leucovorin is also co-administered with trimetrexate for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which is common in ADDS patients. Megaloblastic anemia and dihydropteridine reductase deficiency are also treated with leucovorin. Yet because of the unavailability of the natural (6S)-isomer, these therapies have been performed with (6R,S)-N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolic acid. The unnatural (6R)-isomer cannot perform the functions of the natural isomer. Furthermore, the unnatural isomer of N5-formyl-tetrahydrofolic acid is cleared much more slowly from the blood. Several hours after administration the concentration of unnatural isomer can exceed that of the natural isomer by two orders-of-magnitude. Enzymes, such as thymidylate synthase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase, are inhibited by the unnatural isomers of their tetrahydrofolate cofactors. Further, it is well known that high concentrations of folates can cause kidney damage. 

 Another natural tetrahydropteridine, (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin ((6R)-BH4) is required for metabolic control of phenylalanine levels, and for the biosynthesis of serotonin and the catecholamine neurotransmitters/hormones. In these roles it functions as the natural cofactor for the three aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Recently (6R)-BH4 has been found to be important in the regulation of blood pressure and in the immune response as a participant in the formation of nitric oxide from arginine. The importance of the C6-chirality of BH4 for its biological activity has been well demonstrated. Cofactor replacement therapy for children having a defect in the tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthetic pathway now uses exclusively the costly natural (6R)-isomer. There are several other non-therapeutic uses for specific C6-stereoisomers of tetrahydropteridines, for example as affinity ligands
