<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a capacitive microsensor comprising a sandwich of three silicon wafers (1, 2, 3), a peripheral band of the internal face of each external wafer being bonded to a corresponding band of the opposite face of the central wafer by means of an insulating band (5, 6). The insulating band is a band of silicon oxide which partially penetrates into the outer wafers.

A capacitive microsensor including a sandwich of
three silicon plates (1, 2, 3), a peripheral stripe of the

internal surface of each external plate being coupled to a
corresponding stripe of the surface facing the central plate via

an isolating stripe (5, 6), characterized in that the isolating
stripe is a silicon oxide stripe which partially penetrates

inside the external plates (2, 3).
The capacitive microsensor of claim 1,
characterized in that the protruding height (dl) of the isolating

stripe (5, 6) is substantially half its total thickness (d2).
A method of manufacturing of the capacitive
microsensor of claim 1, consisting of assembling three silicon

plates separated, at least at their circumference, by an
isolating stripe (33, 43), each of the plates being initially a

part of a silicon wafer (30, 35, 40), individual devices being
formed by cutting of the wafer assembly, characterized in that

the isolating stripe (33, 43) is formed by localized oxidation of
the external plates (30, 40).
A method of manufacturing of the capacitive
microsensor of claim 1, consisting of assembling three silicon

plates separated, at least at their circumference, by an
isolating stripe (33, 43), each of the plates being initially a

part of a silicon wafer (30, 35, 40), individual devices being
formed by cutting of the wafer assembly, wherein the isolating

stripe (33, 43) is formed by hollowing appropriate regions of the
external plates (30, 40), oxidizing, and etching of the oxide

outside the hollowed regions.
