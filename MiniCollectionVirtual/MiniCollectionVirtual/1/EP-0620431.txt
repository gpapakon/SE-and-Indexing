<ABSTRACT>
A double-cantilever beam crack growth sensor made 
from welded alloy, e.g., nickel-based alloy, and a 

method for fabricating such sensors. The method 
includes the steps of forming a strongback (54) from a 

block of a first nickel-based alloy; depositing a 
suitable thickness (56) of nickel-based weld alloy on 

top of the strongback to form a bi-metallic test block; 
welding a second block (58) of the first nickel-based 

alloy on top of the weld alloy; and machining the final 
three-layer block to form a double-cantilever beam crack 

growth sensor consisting of cantilever beams (12, 14) 
made of the first nickel-based alloy and a crack growth 

section (18) of weld alloy having a microstructure 
characterized in that the direction of dendritic growth 

is parallel to the direction of crack growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a method for 
fabricating sensors for measuring and monitoring damage 
to structural components within aggressive service 
environments. More particularly, it is directed to a 
method for fabricating double-cantilever beam sensors 
for measuring crack growth in structural components. When structural materials are exposed to particular 
aggressive service environments under steady or cyclic 
stress, the material will be susceptible to damage in 
the form of cracking. This type of damage is commonly 
referred to as "stress corrosion cracking" or "corrosion 
fatigue" (hereinafter "SCC"). It is desirable to 
monitor and assess the extent of damage to structural 
components due to SCC, for example, in a nuclear plant 
which has been operating for a number of years to help 
predict its lifetime. Methods for directly measuring 
crack growth in specimens removed from their environment 
are known. These methods use a variety of monitoring 
systems including visual and voltage potential drop 
methods. U.S. Patent No. 4,677,855 to Coffin et al. 
discloses a method for accurately assessing crack growth 
in structural components through voltage potential drop 
methods by establishing a reasonably accurate 
relationship between measured voltage and crack size.  
 
This patent discloses a sensor for measuring growth of 
a preformed crack within a solid exposed to an 
aggressive environment during application of a load. 
The crack is defined as possessing a mouth and a tip. 
The "mouth of the crack" is defined as the point or line 
of action of load application. The "crack tip" is the 
leading edge of the crack. The "length" of the crack 
is defined as the distance from the mouth of the crack 
to the crack tip. The preformed crack within the solid 
is of a known length. The size and shape of the 
preformed crack can vary widely; however, the cracks 
cannot be so large that the sensor will be separated 
into two sections. The solid must be electrically conductive, such as 
carbon or alloy steel, nickel and nickel-based alloys, 
titanium and its alloys and structural materials such 
as austenitic stainless steels and the like. A current 
is passed through the solid to establish a voltage drop 
across the crack. This voltage is measured by at least 
two pairs of probes, the probes of each pair being 
positioned on opposite sides of the crack at equal, 
known distances from the mouth of the crack. When a current is caused to flow through the sensor 
perpendicular to the crack, the potential
