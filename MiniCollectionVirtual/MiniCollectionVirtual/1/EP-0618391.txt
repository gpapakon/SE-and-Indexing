<ABSTRACT>
Fluid pipe (conduit) based on single or compound thermoplastics, particularly thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) comprising, as appropriate, parts with different shapes, rigidities, and mechanical properties between its ends. It is made up, over practically its entire length, of at least two layers of materials with different properties, and one of which is chosen on the basis of its characteristics of resistance to attack from the transported fluid, on the one hand, and for its impermeability to the said fluid, on the other hand.
