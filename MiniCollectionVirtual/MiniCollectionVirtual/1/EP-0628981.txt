<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a protective switching device provided with power poles, the movable contacts of which are carried by a contact holder (5), with a magnetically and/or thermally triggered protective assembly (8) capable of detecting overvoltages or overcurrents on each pole current path and with a control mechanism (9) capable of being operated by a manual control button (12), this mechanism comprising a magnetic lever (15) with a permanent magnet interacting, on the one hand, with a magnetisable blade (17) for operating the contacts and, on the other hand, a magnetisable triggering blade (16) the movement of which is controlled by the protective assembly (8), characterised in that the mechanism includes means for controlling, in manual control, either the direct opening of the power contacts of a circuit breaker or the like, or, after turning the manual control knob (12), the opening of an ancillary contact (251, 252) making it possible to switch off the current in the coil of the electromagnet for control of a circuit breaker/contactor or the like.
