   "N-SUBSTITUTED   AMINO    ACIDS, PROCESSES FOR
 MAKING THEM AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS
 CONTAINING   THEM68   
 This invention relates to a class of N-substituted   amino    acids which are potentially useful in the treatment of   atherosclerosis.   


 The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of such compounds and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.


 N-Substituted a-amino acids, in particular, N-benzyla amino acids, have been used extensively as protected derivatives for use in peptide synthesis; however, relatively few simple amino acid derivatives have been investigated in respect of bioactivity.


 The   N substituted-DL-amino    acids of formula (I) are known from J. Pharm. Soc. Japan, 1978, 98, (7) 869-879.
EMI1.1     



 wherein R is phenyl and Ranis benzyl, 4-chlorobenzyl,    2-hydroxybenzyl, &alpha;-C10H7CH2-, &beta;-C10H7CH2- and cyclo C6H11-,   
 and wherein R is hydrogen and Ra is benzyl and   4-chioro-      t betzyl.     


 Biological tests, including antibacterial activity and the action on central nervous, circulation and muscular systems were carried out; however, the publication discloses that none of the compounds showed much activity.


 Our Published European Application No.   0031653    discloses compounds of the   formula- (II)   
EMI2.1     

 wherein R1 represents an optionally substituted aryl,
 aralkyl, aromatic heterocyclic or aromatic heterocyclyl
 alkyl group, and R2 represents a phenyl group optionally
 substituted with   C16    alkyl, halogen, hydroxy, trifluoro
 methyl or methylenedioxy. These compounds promote a more
 favourable composition of   l.ipoproteins    in the bloodstream,
 i.e. they are either especially hyperalphalipoproteinaemic
 [i.e. raise the blood levels of high-density lipoproteins
   (HDL)),    with some hypobetalipoproteinaemic behaviour   (i.e.   


 lower blood levels of the low-density lipoproteins   (LDL)   
 and/or the very low-density lipoproteins   (vLDt))    or exert
 both effects.


 We have now discovered a further class of N-substituted
 amino acids, structurally different from those of formula
   (II),    which also possess properties similar to those of the
 compounds of formula   (II).   


 Accordingly, the present invention provides an a-amino acid derivatives of formula   (I II)    or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide or bioprecursor thereof:  
EMI3.1     
 wherein   R1    is optionally substituted aryl, aralkyl,   somatic    heterocyclic or aromatic heterocyclylalkyl group, and
Z
