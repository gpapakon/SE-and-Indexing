<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for regulating the annealing power in at least one annealing section of a continuous annealing and processing line for continuously cast metal products. The speed of the cast products (D) passing through the continuous annealing device is detected, as well as the voltage currently applied to the annealing section, which is converted into an effective value (Ue) by means of a control device (50). The voltage supplied to the annealing section is modified by a control signal derived from the determined effective value of the voltage, in order to achieve a predetermined annealing power value dependent on the measured speed. At least the current flowing in one annealing section is also detected and converted into an effective value. The annealing power actually supplied to the annealing section is calculated from said effective values. The voltage value is modified by a control device until a predetermined value of the annealing power is reached.
