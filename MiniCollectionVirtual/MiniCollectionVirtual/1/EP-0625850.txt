<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recording and 
playback apparatus for digital signals, such as digital 
VTRs and PCM tape recorders, that compresses digital 
signals such as video signals, audio signals and the like 
to record on magnetic tape. Of recent years recording and playback apparatus 
for digital signals compresses a digital signal to record 
instead of directly recording owing to developments in 
compression and expansion techniques and error correction 
techniques. In particular, as described in "The Future of 
Image Information Recording Technology, Tables 1 and 2, 
Prototypes of Digital VTRs of Each Company", Television 
Gakkaishi, Vol. 46, No. 10, pp 1222-1229, video signals are 
recorded on magnetic tape after digitized and compressed by 
compression methods such as DCT, DPCM, and ADRC. For 
example, if an encoded video signal flows at a rate of 115 
Mb/s, then these compression methods compress the signal 
into a signal having a recorded-data rate of 25 Mb/s. As a 
result, an 8 mm VTR having 2 channels × 2 heads can record  
 
the compressed video signal. Like prior apparatus for analog signals, 
recording and playback apparatus for digital signals makes 
its recorded-track pitch in a long-play recording mode 
narrower than its recorded-track pitch in a standard-play 
recording mode. Therefore, It requires narrow magnetic 
heads in the long-play recording mode so that the total 
number of magnetic heads increases. Further, if recorded-data rates are different, 
recording and playback apparatus for digital signals varies 
the rotational speed of the rotary cylinder and the 
traveling speed of the magnetic tape in agreement with the 
recorded-data rate. For example, if the recorded-data rate 
decreases by 50 %, then the rotational speed of the rotary 
cylinder and the traveling speed of the magnetic tape are 
reduced by 50 %. The object of the present invention is therefore 
to provide a recording and playback apparatus for digital 
signals that performs recording in the long-play recording 
mode or at a different bit rate without adding extra 
magnetic heads and with the same recorded-track pitch as in 
the standard-play recording mode. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a recording and playback apparatus for digital  
 
signals that accommodates a plurality of recorded-data 
rates without changing the rotational speed of the rotary 
cylinder and performs high-density recording by azimuth 
recording. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a recording
