<ABSTRACT>
Sports shoe, in particular ski boot, which is designed with a front entry (9) and the sole (2) of which and the upper part (3) of which are moulded from plastic and which has two pressure-distribution plates (5, 6) in the instep region, each of these pressure-distribution plates running from the toe region of the shoe via the instep region and, bent upwards, along the front side of the shoe shaft and, in the forefoot region of the upper part (3), being mounted thereon, movably in the transverse direction of the shoe and displaceably in the longitudinal direction of the shoe in relation to the upper part (3), by means of tabs (14) running in the transverse direction of the shoe, and the two pressure-distribution plates overlapping one another in the closed state of the shoe (1). The tabs (14) are integrated in one piece with the pressure-distribution plates (5, 6) and are in each case suspended via an articulation point (16) on the pressure-distribution plates, this articulation point (16) allowing a movement of the pressure-distribution plates in the transverse direction of the shoe, and the tabs (14) are mounted displaceably in the longitudinal direction of the shoe on the upper part (3) of the shoe.

<CLAIMS>
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, provided with a front 
entrance (9) and having its sole (2) and its upper part (3) formed of 

plastic, and provided at its instep portion with two load distribution 
flaps (5,6), each said load distribution flap extending from the toe 

portion (7) of the boot over said instep portion and, with an upward 
curvature, along the front side of the leg (8) of the bo
ot and being 
connected to said upper part (3) at the forward foot portion (10) thereof 

by means of straps (14) extending in the transverse direction of 
the boot and permitting the respective load distribution flap to be 

displaced relative to the upper part in the longitudinal direction (21) 
of the boot, and to be moved in the transverse diection (15) of the 

boot, said two load distribution flaps overlapping one another in the 
closed condition of the boot so as to cover said entrance (9), characterized 

in that said straps (14) are integrally connected to said load 
distribution flaps (5,6) by respective hinge portions (16), each said 

hinge portion (16) permitting said load distribution flaps to be moved 
in the transverse direction of the boot, and that said straps (14) are 

mouznted on the upper part (3) of the boot for displacement in the 
longitudinal direction (21) thereof. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said hinge portion (16) connecting individual straps 

(14) to the respective load distribution flap (5,6) is formed as a 
web hinge. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that said straps (14) are mounted on the upper part of 

the boot by means of slot-and-pin guide combinations (17,18,19) whereof 
the elongate slots (17) are provided in said straps (14). 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 3, characterized 
in that the pins (18,19) provided for cooperation with said 

elongate slots (17) of said guide combinations are integrally formed 
with the upper part (3) of the boot. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that in the position of said load 

distribution flaps (5,6) overlying said entrance (9), said straps (14) 
are bent inwards under the load distribution flap (5,6) to which they 

are connected, and extend in the direction towards said entrance opening 
(9) of the boot (figs.1,2,3).  

 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 5, characterized 
in that said load distribution flaps (5,6) have their inner 

sides (20) facing towards the interior of the boot provided with abutments 
(22) located adjacent the transversely extending edges (23) of 

the inwards bent straps (14) and acting to support said straps (14) in 
opposition to displacement thereof relative to the associated load 

distribution flap (5,6) in the longitudinal direction of the boot 
(figs. 3, 4) 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 6, characterized 
in that said abutments (22) are integrally formed with said 

load distribution flaps (5,6) at the inner side (20) thereof. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the height of said abutments (22) provided on the 

inner side (20) of said load distribution flaps (5,6) is greater than 
the height (25) of said straps (14) and any guide members (18) for said 

straps (14) connected to the upper part of the boot and extending above 
the height of the straps. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that said straps (14) are disposed to extend away 

from the outer edge (28) of the respective load distribution flap (5) 
in the transverse direction (15) of the boot (fig. 6). 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said load distribution flaps (5, 

6) are provided adjacent their edges (28) with a supporting rib (29) 
contacting the upper part (3) of the boot in the closed state thereof. 
A sport shoe, particularly a ski boot, according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the inner one (5) of the two 

load distribution flaps (5,6) is provided on its upper face with a 
supporting rib (27) adapted to have the outer load distribution flap (6) 

seated thereon.
