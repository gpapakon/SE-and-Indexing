<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with blends of polyolefins, more specifically, the 
melt-miscible polyolefin blends and processes for preparing them. The blends may 
also contain other polymers and are useful in making molded polyolefin articles of 
attractive improved clarity, impact strength and processability. One of the great mysteries of the plastics art has been, until now, an 
understanding of why isotactic polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) are 
immiscible even though they are chemically so similar. Understanding, controlling, 
and using the factors affecting the melt-miscibility of one polyolefin with another, 
for example with polypropylene, have been long-sought goals in the art. Theories 
abound to explain the miscibility between polymer pairs having dipolar, hydrogen-bonding, 
or ionic interactions. These are types of interactions which bring 
significant exothermic (enthalpic) contributions to the free energy of mixing. 
However, no theory has proven effective at explaining the general lack of miscibility 
of pairs of polyolefins, the polyolefins having no significant enthalpic contributions 
to their free energy of mixing, nor has a practical application been made in 
producing miscible blends of polyolefins based on our newly discovered 
understanding of the miscibility behavior of the polyolefins. The problem of predicting and achieving melt-miscibility among blends of 
polyolefins, particularly when PP is one of the polyolefins, and achieving a 
concomitant improvement of certain mechanical properties in the resulting blend, 
had not been overcome previously. The problem addressed by the present 
invention is the provision of melt-miscible olefin blends. (The inventors have 
reviewed several theories which have not proven applicable to the polyolefin 
miscibility problem and have provided some theoretical background related to this 
invention, in Macromolecules, 1992, 25, 5547-5550.) Some workers in the art indeed 
have attempted to produce useful polyolefin blends (see, for example, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,226,952), but they have not recognized that some of their blends might be 
miscible, nor did they identify a preference for those that we now understand to be 
miscible in the melt. The present invention also addresses the problems of making 
miscible blends in combination with other polymers and providing blends having 
properties and performance characteristics improved over less miscible blend 
counterparts.  It is known that polyolefins of useful molecular weights generally do not
