<ABSTRACT>
Adhesive elastomeric matrix adhering directly to a substrate; this matrix includes an elastomer, fillers and an adhesion doping agent; the elastomer is chosen from the group including the ethylene-propylene-diene monomer copolymers and di- or triblock thermoplastic elastomers; this matrix is characterised in that the adhesion doping agent is a trimer of a polyfunctional isocyanate. This matrix is used especially for inhibiting blocks of solid propellant or coating fabric substrates.
