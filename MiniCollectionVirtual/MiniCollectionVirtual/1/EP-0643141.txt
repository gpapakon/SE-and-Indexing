<ABSTRACT>
A method for abating the incidence of cluster formation of reducible 
iron-containing material during the direct reduction of said material 

is disclosed. The method generally comprises contacting the reducible 
iron-containing material with a cluster-abating effective amount of a 

dispersion of a particulate material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The current invention relates to a novel process for lowering the
incidence of clustering or sticking of reducible iron-containing
material during the direct reduction of said material. The process
comprises contacting the reducible iron-containing material prior to
direct reduction thereof with a dispersion of at least one non-pozzolanic
particulate material.It is a well-known technical problem that particulate reducible iron
containing material tends to stick together, forming large clusters or
agglomerates during their processing in a direct reduction furnace.
These clusters tend to remain intact during treatment in a direct
reduction furnace, impeding appropriate flow through the furnace. One
possible though unacceptable solution to this problem is lowering the
furnace temperature and through-put. From the perspective of
efficiency alone this solution is not appropriate.Other solutions have been suggested to decrease clustering in a direct
reduction furnace while maintaining a high processing rate through the
furnace. For example, European Patent Specification No. 207 779
teaches application of a cement coating to the surface of burned iron
ore prior to direct reduction in order to prevent agglomeration in the
direct reduction furnace. US Patent No. 3,062,639 discloses a process
for treating reducible iron oxide by contacting the iron oxide with a
solution comprising an element selected from the group consisting of
an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, a metal of group V, a metal
of group VIB, boron, and silicon. This is intended to prevent
clustering in the furnace reduction zone. US Patent No. 3,549,352 discloses a process for substantially
suppressing bogging (clustering) in an iron ore reduction process by
adding directly to a ferrous reduction bed a dry powder selected from
alkaline earth metal oxides or carbonates, especially the oxides of
calcium and magnesium.In US Patent No. 3,975,182, a method to produce iron oxide pellets
which do not form clusters in a vertical shaft moving bed is disclosed.
In that method, a surface coating of lime, limestone or
dolomite is formed on iron oxide pellets. The lime-containing material
is added in dry form in a balling machine with a spray of a little
water to promote adhesion. The pellets are then fired to form a hard
coating of calcium ferrite.DE-OS-2 061 346 discloses a process for reduction of iron ore pellets
which consists of coating said pellets with a ceramic powder prior to
introduction into the direct reduction furnace. A special adhesive may

<CLAIMS>
A method to lower the incidence of clustering of reducible iron-containing
agglomerates during the direct reduction of the iron in said agglomerates,

said method comprising contacting the reducible iron-containing

material being substantially non-hardening in the presence of water, said

contacting occuring prior to direct reduction.

comprises at least one additive selected from the group consisting of

olivine, serpentine, magnesium, caustic, coke, and mixtures thereof.
The method of any one of claims 1-9 wherein said dispersion contains 1%
to 80% by weight of particulate material.
