<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transport means made integrally of plastics, particularly a transport crate, a tray, a pallet or the like, consisting of a base (1), which consists of a continuous upper base plate (4) and at least one lower base plate (3), said base plates being joined together by means of ribs (5), and of four side walls (2) or edge elevations which are connected to the upper base plate, having an angular recess which is arranged peripherally around the base, forms a stacking edge, and is formed by a wall part (10, 11) parallel to the base and to the side wall. The object of the invention is to provide, with simple means, a crate of high stability which is easy to produce, has smooth walls all around and is therefore easy to clean and, for this reason, is particularly suitable for transporting food. The invention consists in that the side walls or edge elevations are of dual-wall construction, in that the chambers forming the base and the side walls or edge elevations are closed on all sides, and in that the wall of the stacking edge parallel to the base is arranged at a height between the upper and the lower base plate.

One-piece transport means made of plastic, in particular 
transport crate, trays, pallet or the like, consisting of a double 

bottom (1) which comprises a continuous upper bottom plate (4) and 
at least one lower bottom plate (3) which are joined to one another 

by means of ribs (5), and of four double-walled hollow side walls 
(2) or raised edge projections (27) which are joined to the upper 

bottom plate (4), the chambers formed by the double walls and the 
ribs (5) being closed on all sides, with an angular hollow recess 

closed on all sides forming a stacking edge disposed running around 
the bottom (1), which recess is formed by a wall part (10) parallel 

with the bottom and a wall part (11) parallel with the side wall, 
the wall (10) of the stacking edge parallel with the bottom being 

disposed at a level between the upper bottom plate (4) and the lower 
bottom plate (3), characterised in that the double bottom (1) and 

the double side walls (2) or raised edge projections (27) are 
provided internally with ribs (5, 8), in that the inner side wall 

(7) is continued in a rib-like projection (14) which is welded to 
the wall (10) of the stacking edge parallel with the bottom, in that 

the transport means is made of two parts which are welded firmly to 
one another, in that the welds are located in one plane (12), and in 

that the plane (12) in which the welding is carried out runs just 
under the inner bottom plate (4) and just over the wall (10) of the 

stacking edge (10, 11) parallel with the bottom. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
wall (11) of the stacking edge (10, 11) parallel with the side wall 

is offset towards the inside of the crate in relation to the plane 
in which the inner wall (7) lies. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
inner side wall (7) and the outer side wall (6) are joined firmly to 

the wall (10) of the stacking edge (10, 11) parallel with the 
bottom. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that  
 

only the lower part of the side wall (2) is double-walled forming a 
handle well (19), while the upper part is single-walled. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
welds lying in the outer side walls (8) form an unbroken weld seam 

(16) running around the entire crate. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
welds (17) which join the bottom ribs (15) to one another and the 

rib (14) lying under the inner side wall (7) or directly next to the 
inner side wall (7) under the upper crate bottom (4), are disposed a 

distance from one another. 
Transport means according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
ribs (55) to be welded to one another exhibit resilient portions 

(18) at their front sides. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that 
portions (21) which are only single-walled are provided centrally in 

the side walls (2), in that these portions form recesses of the 
outer wall and the upper edge of these portions (21) is formed by 

wall parts (19) which are essentially parallel with the bottom and 
adapted for the crate to be gripped when it is lifted and carried. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
single-walled part is disposed under a double-walled part and in 

that an opening (23) in the double-walled part needed for the 
production process is closed by an edge or wall part (22) which is 

welded on or to it. 
Transport means according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
side walls (2) are narrower at the upper edge than in the lower area 

and in that the wall part (11) of the stacking edge (10, 11) 
parallel with the side wall lies in an (imaginary) plane which runs 

between the inner side wall (7) and the outer side wall (6) or is in 
alignment with the lower edge of the inner side wall (7). 
Transport means in the form of a pallet according to claim 1, 
characterised in that side walls (28, 29) made as separate 

components have external dimensions which are slightly smaller than 
the distances between the insides (7) of facing raised edge  

 
projections (27). 
Transport means according to claim 11, characterised in that 
the narrower side walls (29) can be folded and in the folded state 

lie between the broader side walls (28) and in that the height of 
the side walls (28, 29) is less than the distance between the inside 

walls (7) of facing raised edge projections (27) on the longer 
sides.
