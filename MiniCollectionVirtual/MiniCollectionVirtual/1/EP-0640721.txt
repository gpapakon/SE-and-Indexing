<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for transfering
layers of paving bricks from a uniformly oriented
initial pattern to a herringbone laying pattern.A method and apparatus as described in the preamble of
claims 1 and 5, respectively, are known from EP-A-0.164.146,
in which the bricks are offered in a pattern, in which the
one half of the bricks lies approximately half a length in
front of the second row of intermediate bricks, to a so-called
lazy-tongs (Neurenberger link or mechanism)
operating from above which is provided with suction cups
which are lowered on the bricks. The two rows of bricks
are then brought on different levels vis-à-vis one another
and subsequently converted by the action of the tongs, the
one row of bricks, as seen in the horizontal plane, being
turned clockwise and the other row of bricks being turned
anti-clockwise. Then the bricks are brought back to the
same level and lowered again, to be subsequently removed
to the placing layer to be formed. A drawback of this construction
is that it is rather complicated.Another device for arranging bricks in a herringbone pattern
and transferring these bricks to a substrate while maintaining
this pattern is known from WO-A-83 03270. Here the herringbone
pattern is realized by arranging the bricks in an initial side
by side relationship, spacing the bricks in lateral directions,
turning the bricks over 45° and bringing them back together. Another method and apparatus for transforming layers of
paving bricks from a uniformly oriented initial pattern to
a herringbone laying pattern are known from the Dutch
patent application NL-A-86 00820. Here rows of bricks are fed,
by layer and by transverse row, from a stack of a number
of layers of bricks positioned on the upstream side of the
apparatus across a vibrating and slanting transport plane,
whilst enlarging their mutual transverse distance, to a
converting apparatus, where they are converted by means of
sliding chutes to a slanting position of 45° with regard
to the feed direction. Subsequently the bricks are transported
further up to a transversely placed framing which
can be adjusted to a mean herringbone size of the brick
pattern. It has been appeared that the converted bricks,
particularly the first rows of the module of bricks in
herringbone pattern which is to be formed, can loose
their orientation during displacement from the converting
means to abutment against the stationary framing or
against the last row of bricks placed up against it, and
this in such a way that
