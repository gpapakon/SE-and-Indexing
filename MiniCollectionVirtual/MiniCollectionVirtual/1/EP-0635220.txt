<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device whose object is to transfer filter rod elements for cigarettes from a magazine to a pneumatic transport conduit. This purpose is served by a transfer cylinder which is driven to perform a rotational movement and has recesses for receiving filter rod elements from the magazine, which borders a plurality of recesses, in a first region and for conveying these filter rod elements into a second region, in which the filter rod elements are moved axially out of the recesses and into the transport conduit under the action of air. To this end, the cylinder (1) is provided with a discontinuously operating drive (91). The advantage of the new device resides in an increased transfer rate and security against faults.

A device for transferring filter rods (3) for cigarettes
from a store (7) into a pneumatic conveyor line (16) by means of

a transfer drum (1) which is driven in a rotary movement, having
a plurality of receiving means (2) for removing filter rods from

the adjacent store in a first region (A) and for conveying these
filter rods always in the same direction into a second region (B)

in which the filter rods are moved out of the receiving means
axially into the conveyor line under the action of air,

characterized by a drive (91) by means of which the drum (1) is
rotated in movement cycles, in each case about an angle which

corresponds to the spacing between two adjacent receiving means
(2), one movement cycle being the movement of a full receiving

means into the second region (B) at a higher speed, in the second
region at a lower speed, and, in the empty condition, out of the

second region again at a higher speed, this being the same as the
speed for moving the next, full receiving means into the second

region.
A device according to Claim 1, characterized by a control
arrangement for a drive which is constructed as an electric motor

(91) and has a set-value indicator (97) for the angular velocity
of the motor (91).
A device according to Claim 2, characterized by a set-value
indicator (97) for the angular velocity of the motor (91), an

actual-value indicator (95) detecting the angular velocity of
the motor, and a comparing element (96) which receives the output

signals from the set-value and actual-value indicators and of
which the output signal is delivered to a controllable amplifier

(98) supplying the motor with power.
A device according to Claim 2 and/or 3, characterized by a
set-value indicator (97) and an actual-value indicator (95) which 

emit incremental signals.
A device according to Claim 2 and/or 3, characterized by
set-value and actual-value indicators emitting signals in

digitally encoded form.
A device according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized by a sensor (99) which monitors the transfer of

the filter rods (3) into the pneumatic conveyor line (16) and

brings the drive (91) to a standstill if transfer fails.
