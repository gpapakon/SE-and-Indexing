<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for producing a thermoplastic resin sheet or 
film (2), 

in which a thermoplastic resin is hot-melted and then cooled to give a 
thermoplastic resin sheet or film, it is pressed against the outer 

surface of a 
heated roll (4) or a heated, endless metal belt (5), adhered thereto 

under heat and 
moved along with the roll or belt, then it is inserted and pressed 

between the 
outer surface of the roll and the outer surface of the endless metal 

belt, and 
thereafter it is released from the contact with the roll and then from 

that with 
the endless metal belt to be removed therefrom. Also disclosed is a 

method for 
producing a laminate of two or more thermoplastic resin sheet or films, 

in 
which one thermoplastic resin sheet or film (2) is pressed against and 

adhered under 
heat to the outer surface of a heated roll (4) while another (2') also 

to the outer 
surface of a heated, endless metal belt (5), they are moved along with 

the roll and 
the belt, then the both thermoplastic resin sheets or films are 

inserted and 
pressed together between the outer surface of the roll and the outer 

surface of 
the endless metal belt, and thereafter the resulting laminate is 

released from 
the contact with the roll and then from that with the endless metal 

belt to be 
removed therefrom. Optionally, one or more thermoplastic resin sheets 

or films (2'') 
may be inserted between the two resin sheets or films prior to the 

lamination 
of them. By the methods, non-stretched thermoplastic resin sheets, 

films or 
laminates with high-quality surfaces may be produced by simple 

operation. The 
sheets, films and laminates are suitable for wrapping foods and 

medicines.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for efficiently producing a
non-stretched sheet or film of a thermoplastic resin by simple operation, the
surface of which is smoothed (glazed) or embossed by high-quality treatment.
The sheet or film to be produced by the present invention is favorably used in
the field of wrapping materials for foods and medicines.It is desired that thermoplastic resin sheets and films to be used for
wrapping foods and medicines are highly transparent. The present applicant has
heretofore proposed various techniques of controlling crystallization of
crystalline thermoplastic resins by rapidly cooling them, as methods for
improving the transparency of sheets or films of crystalline thermoplastic
resins (e.g., Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 62-41457 and 62-10816) and has
already put them into practical use.Recently, however, further improvement in the quality of sheet products
and also in the productivity of them has been desired. For this, for example,
glazing (smoothing) or embossing (patterning) of the surfaces of sheets or
films made of thermoplastic resins, as the surface treatment of them, has been
carried out in this technical field. The post-treatment of the kind may be
conducted, using roll-combined devices.However, in order to treat the surfaces of sheets or films made of
thermoplastic resins by rapid, high-quality surface treatment (for example, by 
rapid, high-quality surface smoothing or precision embossing), complicated
devices such as multi-staged rolls are needed. In addition, the surface
treatment has the following problems.For example, glazing (smoothing) with pressure rolls is possible, by
which, however, the sheets treated are oriented only in the MD direction so
that their physical properties could not be well-balanced.Embossing (patterning) with pressure rolls is accompanied by a problem
that the embossing accuracy is lowered when the treatment is conducted at high
speeds.On the other hand, the application of a double-belt pressing technique,
as one of pressing techniques, to the surface treatment or lamination of
thermoplastic resin sheets is extremely effective, but this is accompanied by a
problem that the devices for the treatment are large-scaled, complicated and
expensive.US-A-2,567,275 discloses a continuous process of goffering thermoplastic sheets which
includes the steps of placing the thermoplastic sheet on an endless pressure band, heating
said thermoplastic sheet on the face to be finished, passing the endless pressure band in a
looped path

A method for producing a thermoplastic resin sheet or film, the surface of
which is smoothed or embossed, in which

a thermoplastic resin is hot-melted and then cooled to give a thermoplastic
resin sheet or film, it is pressed against the outer surface of a heated roll

or a heated, endless metal belt, adhered thereto under heat and moved along
with the roll or belt, then it is inserted and pressed between the outer

surface of the heated roll and the outer surface of the heated endless metal belt, and
thereafter it is released from the contact with the roll and then from that

with the endless metal belt to be removed therefrom, wherein in case of glazing

(smoothing) the outer surface of the heated roll and the heated endless metal belt are
mirror finished, and in case of embossing the heated roll is an embossing roll or an

embossing paper is sandwiched between the thermoplastic resin sheet or film and the
heated endless metal belt.
A method for producing a laminate sheet or film, the surface of which is
smoothed or embossed, of thermoplastic

resins using two kinds of thermoplastic resin sheets or films each obtained by
hot-melting a thermoplastic resin and then cooling it, in which one of the

thermoplastic resin sheets or films is pressed against and adhered under heat
to the outer surface of a heated roll while the other also to the outer surface

of a heated, endless metal belt, they are moved along with the roll and the
belt, then the both thermoplastic resin sheets or films are inserted and

pressed together between the outer surface of the roll and the outer surface of
the endless metal belt, and thereafter the resulting laminate is released from

the contact with the roll and them from that with the endless metal belt to be
removed therefrom, wherein in case of glazing (smoothing) the outer surface of the

sheated roll and the heated endless metal belt are mirror finished, and in case of embossing

laminate resin sheet or film and the heated endless metal belt. 
A method for producing a laminate sheet or film, the surface of which is
smoothed or embossed, of thermoplastic

resins using thermoplastic resin sheets or films of three kinds or more each
obtained by hot-melting a thermoplastic resin and then cooling it, in which one

of the thermoplastic resin sheets or films is pressed against and adhered under
heat to the outer surface of a heated roll while another one also to the outer

surface of a heated, endless metal belt, they are moved along with the roll and
the belt while the last one or the remaining ones is/are inserted between the

previous two thermoplastic resin sheets or films, then all these thermoplastic
resin sheets or films are pressed together between the outer surface of the roll

and the outer surface of the endless metal belt, and thereafter the resulting
laminate is released from the contact with the roll and then from that with the

endless metal belt to be removed therefrom, wherein in case of glazing (smoothing)
the outer surface of the heated roll and the heated endless metal belt are mirror finished,

and in case of embossing the heated roll is an embossing roll or an embossing paper is

thermoplastic resin sheet(s) or film(s) is/are pressed under a pressure of 1

kg/cm2 or higher.
