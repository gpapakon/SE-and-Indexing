<DESCRIPTION>
 AUTOMOTIVE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to an automotive air-conditioning system including a fluid transport system for conveying the flow of refrigerant through rigid lengths of conduit or tubing fastened together by flexible connectors capable of accommodating the vibrations, and movement to which the system is subjected during operation of an automotive vehicle with minimal effusion or leakage of fluid from or ingression of moisture into the system and without creating excessive levels of fluid dynamic noise. Preferred flexible connectors for use in the system are also disclosed.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe following patents have been considered in the preparation of this application: U.S. Patent Nos. 2,010,546; 2,273,395; 2,657,076; 2,836,436; 3,528,260; 3,788,394; 4,408,467; 4,480,857; and 4,793, 150 and 5,048,873.In a typical automobile air-conditioning system presently in use, refrigerant is conveyed through a fluid transport system connecting the compressor to the condenser and the evaporator, consisting of flexible hoses combined with rigid tubing to accommodate the vibration and movement existing between the vehicle frame, upon which the condenser and evaporator are rigidly affixed, and the vehicle engine upon which the compressor is rigidly affixed. 

 Refrigerant utilized in automobile air-conditioning systems has historically been R12 freon, which is a chloroflourocarbon (CFC). More recently, R134a, which is a hydroflourocarbon (HFC), has been adopted and is expected to replace R12 as the dominant refrigerant used in such systems. R134a Refrigerant is extremely expensive, much more expensive than R12. However, with progressive taxation recently placed on R12 refrigerants, its cost will similarly rise. Accordingly, it is important that air-conditioning systems used in automotive vehicles be designed to prevent, to the greatest degree possible, any escape of R134a or R12 refrigerant into the atmosphere. The challenge to develop such a system has intensified because flexible hose assemblies presently used to convey refrigerant through the system permit refrigerant loss by effusion through the hose wall and end fitting connection sites. Additionally, flexible hoses presently used in automotive air- conditioning systems permit variable levels of moisture ingression, which, over time, greatly reduces the efficiency of the system. Flexible hoses are also subject to twisting during installation, which not only causes premature wear, but also places

44. A transport system for transporting fluid between a static member and a dynamic member comprising at least first, second, third and fourth lengths of rigid tubing, lying in at least three different planes, said first length connected to said static member, said second length connected to said dynamic member and a plurality of flexible connectors connecting opposing ends of adjacent ones of said lengths, said flexible connectors permitting adjacent ones of said lengths to move pivotally relative to one another and being positioned in high areas of bending moment resulting from movement of said lengths. 

STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 19
The art cited in the International Search Report variously discloses joint structures for joining together lengths of rigid conduit, usually designed to withstand high pressures and high temperatures. The present structure is novel and different when compared with the high pressure, high temperature structures disclosed in the art of record.
Each of the claims, as amended, includes the limitation that the flexible connectors are positioned in those areas of fluid transport which are subjected to high bending moments. Further, the claims are directed toward the positioning of flexible connectors in a fluid transport system subject to motion at the locations of the greatest bending moment and of positioning additional flexible connectors at other positions of high bending moments. The structure of the claimed invention specifies that the lengths of tubing lie in at least three different planes and that the flexible connectors are positioned in the areas of high bending moment resulting from movements of the lengths relative to one another. The art of record does not disclose or suggest this feature of the rigid lengths of tubing being located in at least three different planes with the flexible connectors located in positions of high bending moment.
The three-dimensionaf structure consisting of lengths of rigid tubing Joined together through the specific placement of flexible connectors which are subjected to high bending moments which result from movement of tubing relative to one another in the system is clearly not disclosed or discussed in the art of record. Thus, Applicant submits that the claims as amended clearly distinguish over the cited art of record.
