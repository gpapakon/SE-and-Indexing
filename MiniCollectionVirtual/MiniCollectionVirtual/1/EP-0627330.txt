<ABSTRACT>
The process relates to the etching of a metal, ceramic or glass substrate, in which the substrate (1) is temporarily covered, before etching, with a protective layer (3). The process consists in vacuum depositing a contrast material (6), of the metallic or inorganic type, before removing the protective layer, and then in removing the protective layer and, with it, the contrast material deposited on this layer, in such a way that the contrast material remains only in the impression. The contrast material is preferably deposited by sputtering, but it can also be deposited by vacuum metallisation or by ion implantation.   The contrast material is deposited very cleanly and adheres strongly to the substrate.

<CLAIMS>
Method for obtaining an etched impression (5) 
provided with a contrast material (7), on a metal, 

ceramic or glass substrate (1), according to which the 
substrate is temporarily covered, before etching, with 

a protective layer (3), and according to which, after 
etching, a contrast material (6) of metal or mineral 

type is vacuum deposited, before removing the 
protective layer (3), then the protective layer (3) 

and, with it the contrast material deposited on this 
protective layer, is removed so that the contrast 

material remains only in the impression (7). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the contrast material is deposited by cathode 

sputtering. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the contrast material is deposited by vacuum 

metallization. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the contrast material is deposited by ion 

implantation. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the protective layer (3) is an 

electrolytic layer. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the protective layer (3) has a substantially lower 

melting point than the substrate and the contrast 
material (6) deposited and in that, in order to remove 

the protective layer, the substrate is heated to the 
melting temperature of the protective layer so as to  

 
dislocate the layer of contrast material deposited on 

the protective layer so as to allow chemical attack of 
the protective layer. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the protective layer consists of lead, tin-lead, 

indium, gallium, gold or nickel. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the protective layer is a 

varnish, the surface to be etched being, for example, 
uncovered by action of a laser. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the etching is carried out with 

acid or mechanically. 
Method according to Claim 9, in which the 
location of the impression to be etched is protected by 

a varnish before deposition of the protective layer 
which also consists of a varnish, characterized in that 

two varnishes with different natures are used, allowing 
selective dissolving only of the varnish protecting the 

surface to be etched.
