<ABSTRACT>
2-(Benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-alkyl-6-(2-hydroxy-3-benzoyl-benzyl)phenols 
of formula (I) are prepared by 

reacting a Mannich base of a 
2-(2-hydroxy-5-alkylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole with a 

2-hydroxy-benzophenone. The hybrid products exhibit outstanding 
efficacy in protecting 

organic substrates from light-induced deterioration as well as good 
resistance to loss by 

volatilization or exudation during the processing of stabilized 
compositions at elevated temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention pertains to novel 2-(benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-alkyl-6-(2-hydroxy-3-benzoyl-benzyl)phenols 
and compositions stabilized by said compounds. The UV absorbers of the 2H-benzotriazole and benzophenone type have long been known 
as very effective light stabilizers for a host of organic materials and have enjoyed 
considerable commercial success. The description, preparation and uses of the 2H-benzotriazoles UV absorbers are taught in 
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,004,896; 3,055,896; 3,072,585; 3,074,910; 3,189,615; 3,230,194; 
4,127,586; 4,226,763; 4,278,589; 4,315,848; 4,383,863; 4,675,352; 4,681,905 and 
4,853,471. The description, preparation and uses of the benzophenone UV absorbers are found in a 
comprehensive review by G. R. Lapin in the "Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and 
Technology", N. Bikales, editor, John Wiley-Interscience, New York, Vol. 14, 1971, 
pp 125-148. In some circumstances, the benzotriazole and benzophenone UV absorbers exhibit limited 
compatibility with certain substrates, and/or an excessive tendency to exude, sublime or 
volatilize away during processing of stabilized compositions into sheets, films, fibers or 
other pellicles when processing must be done at elevated temperatures. Likewise, such 
compounds may also suffer undue loss by volatilization or sublimation from fabricated 
structures, particularly thin films, coatings or fibers, especially when such structures are 
subjected to elevated temperatures during use. Attempts have been made to increase compatibility and to reduce volatilization by  
 
modifying the structure of the benzotriazole. U.S. Patent No. 3,230,194 teaches that 
substitution of a higher alkyl group (tert-octyl) for a lower alkyl group (methyl) improves 
compatibility and performance of the substituted benzotriazole in polyethylene. Likewise in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,278,590; 4,283,327 and 4,383,863, 
2-(2-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-octylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole 
is shown to exhibit an excellent combination of 
compatibility with and/or solubility in numerous polymer substrates along with superior 
resistance to loss from stabilization during high temperature processing, in end-use 
applications where coating or films of the stabilized compositions are exposed to ambient 
weathering and light, and in photographic applications. U.S. Patent No. 4,675,352 teaches that liquid benzotriazoles of low volatility are prepared 
by the alkylation of preformed 2-(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-2H-benzotriazole. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,936,305; 4,681,905; 4,684,680; 4,684,679 and
