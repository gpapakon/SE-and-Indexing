<ABSTRACT>
The processing foresees the pre-arrangement of the raw material, 
consisting of the refuses formed by the strips cut long the sides 

of the nonwoven fabric, for the subsequent mixing acting its tertiary 

crushing by means of a knife cutting up machine. In the mixing the 
raw material is initially mechanical mixed with the alumina trihydrate 

by means of a mixer; then into the mixer are added the other components: 
unsaturated polyester resin, 1,1 Di(Ter-butylperoxide)cyclohexane, 

zinc stearate and parabenzoquinone solution to 10% in styren 
previously mixed by a propeller mixer. The mixing is going on for 

five minutes and then the obtained shaving mass is discharged by 
a screw conveyor placed on the mixer bottom. Said shaving mass is 

then molded with hot pressing at a temperautre of 145°C by means 
of a punch press with molding pressure of 50 Kg/cm2 and foreseen 

a molding time of five minutes for each thickness centimeter. In 
this way four-sided plate insulating boards are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a processing for producing a new insulating
material in rigid plane with distinguished sound absorbent, heat insulator
and self-extinguished characteristics as well as a good damp resistance.
Said new material to be produced by a new process of components
quantitatively given in basic formulation which foresees the use of
the conventional refuses coming from the working of nonwoven fabrics
and synthetic fibers. In the finishing process of said textiles,
particularly in the trimming of the sides, refuses are caused. Said
refuses, long irregular strip shaped, to be arranged in bales to be
sent into the area landfill for their disposal like special wastes.Currently the necessity to must destroy said special wastes creates
two drawbacks. The first drawback for the manufacturer who trust transport
the special wastes into the area landfill or otherwise, within
an agreement, he must make use of someone specialized in transport
and the second drawback coming from the presence of a lot of special
wastes to be destroyed in the local disposal plant. The described
processing comes to avoid the two aforesaid drawbacks and moreover
it permits the use of current refuses coming from the nonwoven fabric
working like raw material for the producing of new insulating material.The obtained insulating material, for effect of the connatural insulating
features of its components, looks distinguished insulating characteristics
from the noise and from the heat and also a good resistance
to the damp and to the flame; this last feature particularly due to
the fact that, if licked up from a flame, the material tends to put 
out the same emitting steam. These insulating features to be adjusted in the
intensity of their effect so to be suited to the various use necessities
only therefor opportunely changing the board density in the moulding phase.The process foresees the pre-arrangement of the raw material consisting
of the refuses formed by the strips cut long the sides in the nonwoven
fabric finishing working. Said raw material taking through a collecting
system from the various places to be prepared for the subsequent working
acting its tertiary crushing by means of a knife cutting up machine.After this treatment the raw material is then used in the process to
produce a mass to be moulded. The process to produce
mass foresees the mixing of the following components (in the given weight
percent): 1) raw material consists of the refuses of nonwoven fabric
working sodden with acrylic resin for 47,25%; 2)

<CLAIMS>
Process for producing insulating boards from the refuses
from the production of non-woven fabrics, wherein as raw

material the strips cut from the sides of the non-woven
fabric, and comminuted in a knife cutting machine are

employed, wherein the following components are mixed:

(a) 47.25% of the above mentioned raw material sodden
with acrylic resi
n,
(b) 10% of an unsaturated polyester resin,
(c) 0.9% of 1,1-di(tert.-butylperoxide)cyclohexane,
(d) 40% of alumina trihydrate,
(e) 1,8% of zinc stearate and
(f) 0.05% of a 10% solution of parabenzoquinone in styrene.

The mixing being carried out by the following steps:

(i) mixing the above mentioned components (a) and (d) by
means of a mixer to form a first premix,
(ii) preparing a second premix from the remaining components
(b), (c), (e) and (f) in a propeller mixer and
(iii) then mixing the thus obtained premixes for five
minutes; (iv) discharging the thus obtained mass by

means of a screw conveyor placed on the mixer bottom and
(v) subsequently moulding said mass by hot pressing at a
temperature of 145°C by means of a punch press with a

moulding pressure of 50 kg/cm
2
 for a moulding time of
five minutes per each centimetre of thickness to form

square plate insulating boards.
Process for producing insulating boards from the refuses of
the nonwoven fabric production, as defined in claim 1; wherein when the

molding is ended and the punch forging press opened, the insulating
board is taken out by means of a hydraulic device which raises 

to a taking place the board formed on the bottom of the fixed lower
punch of the punch forging press.
Process for producing insulating boards from the refuses of
the nonwoven fabric production, as defined in claim 1, wherein

the mass, discharged by the screw conveyor at the end
of the mixing, is put into film casing impermeable to the styrene

and then these casing are put up in container so to permit the afterwards
moulding.
Process for producing insulating boards from the refuses of
the nonwoven fabric production, as defined in claim 1, wherein before the

moulding the mass in the requested quantity is let into the
fixed lower punch and it is processed by surface vibrators or with

other vibrating means to increase the mass homogeneity.
Process for producing insulating boards from the refuses of
the nonwoven fabric production, as defined in claim 1, wherein suited pigments are added during the mixing to colour

the shaving mass so to produce coloured insulating boards.
