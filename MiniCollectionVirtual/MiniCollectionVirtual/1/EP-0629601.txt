<ABSTRACT>
An isobutylene feed mixture comprising MTBE, isobutylene 
and methanol is passed through an isobutylene conversion 

zone to form an isobutylene conversion product comprising 
unreacted methanol, unreacted isobutylene, dimethyl ether, 

MTBE and water, then charged to a countercurrent methanol 
extraction zone and contacting with water to provide an 

overhead raffinate comprising isobutylene, MTBE and water, 
and an extract comprising methanol, water, MTBE, 

isobutylene and dimethyl ether; the extract is distilled 
to provide a vaporized overhead fraction comprising MTBE, 

isobutylene, methanol, and dimethyl ether; the vaporized 
overhead fraction is partially condensed and from 5 to 10 

wt.% of the mixed phase condensate is vented to thereby 
provide a liquid condensate that is substantially free 

from dissolved dimethyl ether, and the condensate is 
recycled to the methanol extraction zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the manufacture 
and purification of methyl tertiary butyl ether. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a method for the 
manufacture of methyl tertiary butyl ether from tertiary butyl 
alcohol, isobutylene and methanol and for the purification of 
the methyl tertiary butyl ether formed by the reaction. Stillmore 
particularly, this invention relates to a method for the 
manufacture of methyl tertiary butyl ether from tertiary butyl 
alcohol, isobutylene and methanol and for an improvement in 
the purification of the methyl tertiary butyl ether formed by 
the reaction in the removal of dimethyl ether formed during 
the reaction. The preparation of methyl tert-butyl ether from methyl 
and tert-butyl alcohols is discussed in S. V. Rozhkov et al., 
Prevrashch Uglevodorodov, Kislotno-Osnovn. Geterogennykh 
Katal. Tezisy Dokl., Vses. Konf., 1977, 150 (C. A. 92:58165y). 
Here the TBA and methanol undergo etherification over KU-2 
strongly acidic sulfopolystyrene cation-exchangers under mild  
 
conditions. This reference contains data on basic parameters 
of such a process. In U. S. -A- 4,144,138 (1979) to Rao et al., there 
is disclosed a method for recovering methyl tertiary butyl 
ether from an etherification reaction effluent by azeotropic 
distillation to recover a methanol-ether azeotrope overhead 
which is water-washed to give pure ether raffinate, the latter 
being azeotropically distilled to yield ether-methanol 
overhead which is recycled to water washing. Copending European Application No. 93309126.6 (EP-A-600632) 
discloses a method for the preparation of methyl 
tertiary butyl ether wherein tertiary butyl alcohol is reacted 
with methanol to provide a reaction product comprising methyl 
tertiary butyl ether and by-product isobutylene and wherein 
the by-product isobutylene is reacted with methanol to provide 
additional methyl tertiary butyl ether and also a method for 
the purification of the methyl tertiary butyl ether. U. S.-A-4,814,517 discloses a modified 
method for the purification of methyl tertiary butyl ether 
manufactured from methanol and isobutylene wherein a distillate 
overhead stream obtained during the purification of the 
methyl tertiary butyl ether is passed in liquid phase sequentially 
through a bed of silica gel to removal methanol and a 
bed of a zeolite molecular sieve to remove dimethyl ether.  
 Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) is finding increasing 
use as a blending component in high octane gasoline as the 
current
