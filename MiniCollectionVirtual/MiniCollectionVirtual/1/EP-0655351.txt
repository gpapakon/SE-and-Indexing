<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire 
using a double-twisted organic fiber as a carcass cord, and 
having good tire side evenness, high tire side rigidity, 
high initial tensile rigidity, and reduced weight. In the past, when an organic resin fiber, such as a 
polyester fiber, was used as a carcass cord for a tire, 
only those having a twisting structure with the same ply-twisting 
number n1 and cable-twisting number n2 (i.e., a 
balanced cord), were selected in order to prevent 
deterioration in the wear strength of the cord. Usually, a cord having a cable-twisting coefficient N2 
of about 0.7 and a ply-twisting coefficient N1 of about 0.5 
was used, where both the cable-twisting and ply-twisting 
coefficients were fairly high (e.g., 0.5 ≤ N1 and 0.7 ≤ N2). For example, when a fiber having a twisting structure 
1500D/2 (i.e., two 1500 denier filaments which have been 
twisted together) was used, the ply-twisting number was 
about 40 turns/10 cm and the cable-twisting number was 
about 40 turns/10 cm; and when a fiber having a twisting 
structure 1000D/2 was used, the ply-twisting number was  
 
about 50 turns/10 cm and the cable-twisting number was 
about 50 turns/10 cm. In order to prevent deterioration of the wear strength 
of the cord, a cord having a large twisting number and a 
ply-twisting number that is the same as its cable-twisting 
number has been used. However these are not the best properties of a tire 
carcass cord either for controlling the initial tensile 
rigidity of the cord, or for reducing the tire side 
unevenness (that is, increasing the unevenness index), or 
for heightening the rigidity of the tire side. 
Furthermore, the radius of the cord increases with a higher 
twisting number. This is disadvantageous for weight 
reduction because the gauge of the cord coating rubber is 
increased. As described above, for a balanced cord, that is, a 
cord having a ply-twisting number n1 (turns/10 cm) that is 
the same as its cable-twisting number n2 (turns/10 cm), it 
is difficult to satisfy both wear resistance and other 
properties, such as a good tire side evenness (i.e., a 
large unevenness index), high tire side rigidity, and 
reduced weight by reducing the radius of the cord. In view of the above-described problems of the prior 
art, an object of the present invention is to provide a  
 
pneumatic tire having good tire side evenness (i.e., a 
large unevenness index), high tire side rigidity, high 
initial tensile rigidity and reduced weight, by using an 
unbalanced tire
