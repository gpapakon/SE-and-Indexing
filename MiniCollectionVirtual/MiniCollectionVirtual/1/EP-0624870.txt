<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for making optical discs, of the type 
comprising two disc units (201,202), bonded together with 

adhesive (32), comprises a centre shaft (31) supporting the 
two units and means (63,64) for holding a point on the edge 

of one unit (202) so that the one unit is tilted relative to 
the other. The holding means (63,64) can be lowered to 

bring the surfaces of the two units into contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for manufacturing 
an optical disc, such as an erasable optical disc, which may 
be used as, for example, an external device of computers. Figure 1 shows a cross-section of an ordinary optical disc, 
designated as 10. A recording layer 2 is formed on a transparent 
substrate 1 of resin, such as, for example, polycarbonate, and 
a protective film 3 is formed over the recording layer 2. The 
substrate 1, the layer 2 and the film 3 form a disc unit 4. Two 
such disc units 4 are bonded to each other at the exposed surfaces 
of the respective protective films 3 with an adhesive layer 5. 
Thus, the optical disc 10 is formed. Conventionally, in order 
to bond the disc units 4 together, a thermosetting adhesive, an 
ultraviolet-curable adhesive, or a thermoplastic adhesive has been 
used. A corrosive component contained in such adhesives, however, 
tends to degrade the recording layers 2, and, in particular, when 
the water absorption of the adhesive layer 5 is high, the 
protective films 3 and the recording layers 2 are oxidized, which 
lowers the reliability of the disc 10. A moisture-curing adhesive, 
such as one-pack epoxy resin adhesive, may be used. However, when 
disc units having large areas are bonded with a thin layer of a 
moisture-curing adhesive, air or moisture hardly penetrates to 
reach center portions of the bonded disc units, resulting in 
incomplete curing of the adhesive. Furthermore, bonding disc units 
with such an adhesive requires a long time and also is a difficult 
working. When two-pack non-mixing type resins and microcapsule 
type resins are used, some components may remain uncured, which 
will erode the discs. Furthermore, such adhesives can provide  
 
insufficient adhesion. For such reasons, two-pack non-mixing type 
and microcapsule type adhesives are considered unsuitable for 
bonding disc units. Another problem which may be encountered when curing type 
adhesives are used is that contraction of the curing adhesive may 
cause distortion of the disc units. In particular, when a 
thermosetting adhesive is used, not only contraction of the 
adhesive occurring when it cures but also heat applied for causing 
the adhesive to cure will distort the adhesive layer 5 itself. 
Distortion of the adhesive layer 5 causes deformation or warpage 
of the disc units, and, therefore, resulting optical discs may 
have to be rejected. The use of a thermoplastic resin adhesive rather than a 
thermosetting resin as the adhesive layer 5 is disclosed in, for 
example,

Apparatus for manufacturing an optical disc comprising two circular 
disc units, said apparatus comprising a centre shaft (31) mounted on a 

support (30) for supporting said two disc units (201,202); holding means 
(63;44,45) for holding a first point on the outer periphery of one of the two 

disc units (202) so that said one of the two disc units (202) slants relative to 
the other one of the two disc units (201) as it rests on said support (30) with 

a second point of the periphery of said one of the two disc units (202) being 
in contact with a peripheral point on the other one of the two disc units 

(201); driving means (62;41) for supporting said holding means, said driving 
means being movable up and down at an adjustable speed; and angle 

adjusting means (33;42,43) for moving said driving means (62;41) in order to 
vary the slanting angle of said one disc unit. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
driving means is mounted on a shaft (60) whose inclination 

relative to the centre shaft (31) is adjustable by said 
angle adjusting means. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2 in which the 
holding means includes an extension (64) extending from the 

shaft (60) to support said point on said one of the two disc 
units (202). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 in which the 
holding means (63) is actuable to retract the extension 

(64). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
holding means comprises an arm (44) having means (45) at one 

end for holding said point on said one disc unit (202).  
 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6. Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 in which thein which the 
holding means (44,45) holds the disc unit from above. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 or 6 in which the 
means (45) at one end of the arm (44) holds the disc unit by 

suction. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5,6 or 7, in which 
the angle adjusting means comprises rotation means (42) 

mounted on the drive means for rotating the arm about a 
pivot point (43) whereby to adjust the angle of the drive 

means relative to the arm and the one disc unit (202). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5,6,7 or 8 in which 
the drive means has the form of a jack.
