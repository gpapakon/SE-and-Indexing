<ABSTRACT>
A quick strap fastening device comprising a bar in one end of a strap member (5). The bar consists of a pin (1) comprising a cylindrical hole (3) in which a rod (2) engaged by a resilient compression means (4) is slidably mounted. The rod (2) is activated by an activating button (9) and the end (14) of the rod (2) interacts with a positioning aperture (17) in a positioning position, with an insertion aperture (16) in an insertion position and a hole (13) in a closed position. The apertures (16, 17) and the hole (13) are provided in an apertured watch housing horn (15).

A quick-fixing device for a watchband comprising an 
elastic bar mounted in one of the ends of a watchband element 

(5) and comprising two main elements, a shaft (1) including 
a rod (10) intended to cooperate with a hole (11) 

formed in the inside vertical face of a watchcase cusp with 
a hole (12), and a rod (2) slidingly mounted in a cylindrical 

hole (3) formed in the shaft (1), an elastic compression 
member (4) being disposed in the cylindrical hole so as to 

exert a pressure against the bottom of the cylindrical hole 
and against the inside face of
 the rod (2) which includes an 
operating rod (8) mounted perpendicular on the rod (2), the 

operating rod being disposed in through openings (6 and 7) 
formed in the shaft (1) and the end of the watchband element 

(5), respectively, and the operating rod including an operating 
button (9) disposed under the watchband element, 

characterized in that the other cusp with openings (15) includes 
in its lower horizontal face a positioning opening 

(17) having a semicylindrical shape in vertical section and 
formed with equal depth along its entire length, and includes 

in its inside vertical face an intermediate introduction 
opening (16) having a semicylindrical shape in 

horizontal section and joining the positioning opening as 
far as a hole (13) intended to receive the end of the sliding 

rod, and the end (14) of the sliding rod of the bar has 
a spread-out position in which the operating button 9 is 

not operated and in which it can be lodged either in the 
positioning opening (17) or in the hole (13), the intermediate 

opening (16) having a depth sufficient for 
permitting the end of the sliding rod, in a completely 

retracted position by operation of the button, to pass from 
the positioning opening to the hole (13) upon ist 

introduction in the latter.  
 
The fixing device of claim 1, characterized in that 
the intermediate introduction opening (16) stands back from 

the upper part of the hole (13) so that this upper part 
constitutes an upward stop. 
The fixing device of claim 1, characterized in that 
the end of the two rods of the shaft (1) has a 

semispherical shape. 
The fixing device of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the positioning openings (17) and the intermediate 

introduction openings (16) have a radius which is equal 
with clearance to the radius of the end (14) of the bar.
