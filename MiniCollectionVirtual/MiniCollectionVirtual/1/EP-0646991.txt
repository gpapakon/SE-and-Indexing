<ABSTRACT>
A wire holder for a water-proof connector is coupled 
to an electrical wire which, together with a sealing rubber 

plug, is inserted into the housing of said water-proof 
connector. The wire holder has a regulating portion which is 

fixedly arranged behind the rubber plug, and fitted on the 
electrical wire extended from the housing, to regulate the 

bending position of the electrical wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wire holder for a water-proof
connector which suitably enhances the water-proof
characteristic of the water-proof connector.One example of a conventional method of inserting an
electrical wire into a water-proof connector is as follows:
As shown in FIG. 5, a rubber plug 102 is mounted on the
electrical wire 101 in advance, and the latter 101 together
with the rubber plug 102 is press-fitted into a cylindrical
structure 104 which is connected to the rear end face of a
connector housing 103, so that the latter 103 is held water-tight.
The rubber plug 102 is, in general, in the form of a
cylinder having an insertion hole 102 into which the
electrical wire 101 is inserted, and a plurality of flange-shaped
seals on the outer cylindrical surface. The waterproofing
function of the rubber plug 102 attributes both to
the elastic force which is provided by the rubber plug 102
when the electrical wire 101 is inserted into the rubber plug
102 under pressure, and to the elastic force which, when the
seals of the rubber plug are press-fitted into the
cylindrical structure 104 of the housing 103, is provided
radially outwardly of the cylindrical structure 104.Depending on the wiring arrangement, sometimes it is
impossible to lay the electrical wire 101 straight; that is, 
it is forced to bend the electrical wire 101 as shown in FIG.
5. In this case, the bending force acts on the wall 110 of
the rubber plug 102 on the side towards which the electrical
wire 101 is bent, thus contracting it. As a result, on the
opposite side, a gap 111 is formed between the electrical
wire 101 and the insertion hole 102a of the rubber plug 102.
Hence, water may enter the connector through the gap thus
formed.GB 2 207 817 A discloses a ventilation water-proof connector
which provides a ventilation tube for introducing an outside
air into the connector housing to prevent water permeation
into the housing due to pressure difference between inside
and outside of the housing.GB 2 187 896 A shows a packing plug assembly used in a water-proof
connector, especially a packing plug assembly having a
structure for preventing insufficient retention of a terminal
therein.In view of the foregoing, an object of this invention
is to provide a wire holder for a water-proof connector which
is able to suitably maintain the connector water-proof even
in the case where it is required to bend the electrical wire
near the rear end of the connector.The foregoing object of the invention has been
achieved by the provision of a wire
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A wire holder for a water-proof connector which is coupled
to an electrical wire (5) which is inserted into

the housing (1) of the water-proof connector, said wire
holder comprising:


a sealing rubber plug (7) fitted on the electrical wire
(5) for sealing between the electrical wire (5) and the

housing (1) of the water-proof connector; and
a holder member (8) including a regulating portion (20)
which is fixedly arranged behind said rubber plug (7)

and fitted on the electrical wire (5) extended from
said housing (1), said holder member (8) further including

an insertion hole (21) into which the electrical
wire (5) is inserted, characterized by
a groove (22) which is straightly cut from the outer
cylindrical surface of a regulating portion (20) of

said holder member (8) through said insertion hole
(21).
A wire holder according to claim 1, wherein said groove
(22) in said regulating portion (20) terminates in a

hinge piece (23).
A wire holder according to claim 1 or 2, wherein said
holder member (8) is provided with a fitting portion

(24) protruding from one end face of said regulating
portion (20) and being slightly smaller in diameter

than the latter.
A wire holder according to anyone of the preceding
claims, wherein said holder member (8) is made of rubber 

or synthetic resin being harder than the material
of the rubber plug (7).
A wire holder according to anyone of claims 1 to 4,
characterized by a second insertion hole (21) for a

second electrical wire (5), and a second groove (22)
which is straightly cut from the outer surface of the

regulating portion (20) through the insertion hole
(21).
