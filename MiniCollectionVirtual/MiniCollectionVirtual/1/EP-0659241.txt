<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a compressed-air actuated disc brake with a brake caliper enclosing a brake disc on one side of which there is an application device which, when acted upon by compressed air, actuates at least one adjusting spindle arranged to move in a croshead and acting, via a pressure member fitted on its end nearest the brake disc, on the pressure plate of a brake pad fitted on the application side of the caliper so as to move in relation to the brake disc. An adjusting device maintains the gap, which alters as the brake pad wears, constant by acting on the adjusting spindles. In order to reduce the weight while retaining great efficiency and low hysteresis, the invention proposes the use of a fork-shaped pivoting lever in which two shanks extend or fork from the end region of its actuating arm, the semicircular pivot bearing and the bearing for the eccentric taking the form of suitable pairs of bearings in the end regions of the shanks.

Compressed-air actuated disk brake comprising a caliper 

(2)
 which reaches around a brake disk 
(1)
 and on one 
side of which an application device 
(3)
 is arranged 
which has a pivoting lever 
(4)
 which is disposed, 
facing away from said brake disk, in an essentially 

semicircular pivot bearing 
(30)
 supported with respect 
to said caliper 
(2)
 so that it can be swivelled about 
an axis of rotation 
(25)
 extending in parallel to the 
plane of said brake disk 
(1)
 and, facing the brake 
disk, by means of a rotatably disposed eccentric 
(6)
 
rests approximately in the longitudinal center against 

a traverse 
(7)
 which extends in parallel to said axis 
of rotation 
(25)
 and which is guided to be displaceable 
with respect to said brake disk 
(1)
 and, by way of at 
least one pressure member 
(70, 71)
, acts upon a brake 
pad 
(10)
 which, on the application side, is disposed in 
said caliper 
(2)
 to be displaceable with respect to 
said brake disk 
(1)
, the end region of an actuating arm 

(4a)
 of said pivoting lever 
(4)
 engaging with the 
pressure piston of a brake cylinder 
(40),
characterized in that
 
said pivoting lever 
(4)
 is designed to be essentially 
fork-shaped with two legs 
(4b, 4c)
 extending from the 
end region of said actuating arm 
(4a),
 said 
semicircular pivot bearing 
(30)
 as well as the bearing 
of said eccentric each being formed by corresponding 

pairs of bearings in the end regions 
(4d, 4e)
 of said 
legs, the arrangement of said two bearings 
(30, 31)
 in 
said legs 
(4b, 4c)
 as well as the course of said two 
legs 
(4b, 4c)
 being selected such that the theoretical 
points of the introduction of force 
(P1, P2)
 of said 
two bearings are essentially situated on the center 

line of the corresponding leg 
(4b, 4c).
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 
1, 
characterized in that
 the pivotal mounting of said 
eccentric 
(6)
 is achieved by a pair of bearings 
(31)
 
arranged between said eccentric 
(6)
 and said traverse 

(7)
 and/or by a pair of bearings 
(31)
 arranged between 
said eccentric 
(6)
 and said pivoting lever 
(4)
. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to claim 1 
or 2, 
characterized in that
 said two semicircular pivot 
bearings 
(30)
 are constructed as roller bearings. 
Compressed-air actuated disk brake according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 said bearings 
(31)
 
of said eccentric are constructed as slide bearings.
