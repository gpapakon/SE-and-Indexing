<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for measuring stairs,
wherein the riser and tread of the separate steps are
determined, and to an assembly for carrying out such method.For mounting for instance stair elevators, it is
important that the form and dimensions of the stair, or at
least a number of steps, be univocally and accurately
recorded. It is conventional to do so by making a sketch of
the stair or steps and writing the measurements and angles
therein. This enables a working drawing to be made at another
location, for instance on a CAD system or drawing table, for
forming the different parts of a fitting stair elevator.In this connection, it is essential that the measurements
included in the drawing exactly correspond to the real
dimensions, because otherwise either the stair or the stair
elevator should be adapted, which involves considerable
inconvenience, costs and delay in completion.The recording of the dimensions of the separate steps
usually takes place by measuring the depth of the step, the
so-called tread, and the height of the step, the so-called
riser, with for instance a measuring tape or a jointed rule.
For this purpose, a lath is positioned at right angles to the
front edge of a step in such a manner that the lower side of
the lath is level. Subsequently, a second lath is positioned
vertically along the front edge of a superjacent step on the
first lath. This permits the tread of the subjacent step to be
measured along the first lath, and the riser of the
superjacent step along the second lath. When this measuring method is used in practice, it
appears that errors are frequently made during measuring,
which errors cannot be recognized in time. One of the reasons
thereof is that during measuring, two independent dimensions,
i.e. the riser and the tread, are also measured independently
of each other. This allows for a poor verification afterwards
of the dimensions of the stair.Hence, the object of the invention is to provide a method
for measuring stairs of the type described in the opening
paragraph, wherein the above-described problems no longer
occur.To this end, the method according to the invention is
characterized in that at least two steps are in a
corresponding manner provided with a reference point,
whereupon in each reference point a pin is placed, with the
two pins crossing in a junction such that of each pin the
length between the reference point and the junction is known,
whereupon subsequently, in the plane defined by the pins, the
angle of each pin with a reference line is
