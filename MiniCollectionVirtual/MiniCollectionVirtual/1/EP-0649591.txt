<ABSTRACT>
The signals from noise alarms (8, 8A) arranged on a shear-bar rail (2) are digitised via threshold switches (SS1, SS2) and are fed in parallel to a microprocessor (9) and, for safety monitoring, to a counter (Z) and to a pulse-gap detector (TR2) which resets the counter (Z) whenever there is a pulse gap. If a predetermined counter curve occurrs, a safety circuit (SR) is activated which interrupts the supply of voltage to servomotors (20, 20A) of the shear-bar rail (2). The servomotors (20, 20A) are, moreover, activated by the control device (ST) by means of safety-increasing program flows.

cutter bar (2), in particular of a forage harvester, comprising a

grinding device, and at least two knocking sensors (8, 8A) whose low pass-filtered
knocking sensor signals which are produced whenever contact occurs

between the co-operating cutter bar (2) and cutting blades (5, 5*) arranged
on a rotating blade drum (4) are fed to a control arrangement (ST) having a

microprocessor (9) which, in dependence on the knocking sensor signals
evaluated with threshold values, so actuates two setting motors (20, 20A) of

adjusting mechanisms (14) which are coupled to the ends of the co-operating
cutter bar (2) in relation to the blade drum (4), that a respective

predetermined cutting gap is produced, characterised in that the low pass-filtered
knocking sensor signals are fed directly to a respective threshold

value circuit (SS1, SS2) whose threshold value is so selected that a
plurality of output pulse signals (I1, I2) occur as a result of a respective

contact taking place, in respect of intensity, which output pulse signals,
coming from the two threshold value circuits (SS1, SS2), are fed to a

counter (Z) at the counting input and are fed to a first retriggerable
timing member (TR1) whose time constant corresponds to the duration of a

series of a few output pulse signals (I1, I2), at the trigger input, and
that the negated time signal (TR1N) from the first timing member (TR1) which

occurs at a pulse gap of corresponding length respectively resets the
counter (Z) from which a counter signal (D4, D5, D6), upon the attainment of

a predetermined counter condition, sets a second retriggerable timer circuit
(TR2) or a hold circuit whose output signal (VS) actuates a safety switch

(SR) which separates the voltage supply line (UL) from the setting motors

rotation.

virtually synchronously to reduce the cutting gap until either a

predetermined number of safety revolutions is attained or the output pulse
signals (I1, I2) have occurred in succession as a pulse group without a

prolonged interruption,
then the setting motors (20, 20A) are actuated to increase the width
