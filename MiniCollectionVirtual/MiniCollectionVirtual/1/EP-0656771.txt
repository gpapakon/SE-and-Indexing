<ABSTRACT>
A transdermal drug delivery device (10) which can be worn by a human patient for 24 hours while continuously delivering a drug to the patient for approximately 16 hours is produced by a particular method of manufacture. The device (10) is particularly useful with respect to the delivery of drugs which, if delivered for 24 hours, result in problems such as drug tolerance (e.g., nitroglycerin) or sleep disorders (e.g., nicotine). The drug is loaded into the device (10) in a concentration such that the drug becomes depleted from the device after approximately 16 hours to the extent that the rate of delivery of the drug to the patient is slowed to such an extent that the pharmacological effect of the drug on the patient becomes substantially nonexistent. The device (10) is in the form of a laminated composite that is adpated to be adhered to a predetermined area of unbroken skin or mucosal tissue. The individual layers of the device include an upper backing or "outer skin" layer (11), an anchor adhesive layer (12), a source layer (13) onto which the drug and/or vehicles are deposited initially, a contact adhesive (14) which is adapted to adhere to the skin or mucosa, and a release liner (15).

 PRINTED TRANSDERMAL DRUG DELIVERY DEVICECross-Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of our earlier filed pending U.S. application Serial No. 07/769,155, filed September 27, 1991, which is a continuation of U.S. application Serial No. 07/453,617, filed December 20, 1989 (abandoned), which is a divisional of U.S. application Serial No. 07/215,074, filed July 5, 1988 (U.S. Patent4,915,950), which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 07/155,327, filed February 12, 1988 (abandoned) , all of which applications are incorporated herein by reference and to which applications we claim priority under 35 U.S.C. §120.Field of the InventionThis invention relates generally to transdermal delivery devices and to methods of making and using such devices. More particularly the invention relates to transdermal nicotine delivery systems which include particular amounts of nicotine within a matrix allowing the device to be worn for 24 hours but be depleted of nicotine to the extent that nicotine is not further delivered to the patient after a period of about 16 hours. 

Backσround of the InventionA variety of devices have been proposed or used for administering drugs transdermally. These devices are generally in the form of a bandage or skin patch that includes a reservoir that contains the drug and a pressure-sensitive adhesive component by which the device is attached to the skin. Depending upon the inherent permeability of the skin to a particular drug, the device may also include means for coadministering a percutaneous absorption enhancer or an element, such as a membrane interposed between the reservoir and the skin, that regulates the rate at which the drug or the percutaneous absorption enhancer is administered to the skin. The commercially available techniques for manufacturing these devices involve conventional casting and laminating processes. Actual incorporation of the drug is typically effected by (1) admixture of the drug with a compatible solvent, (2) incorporation of the drug into the drug reservoir by immersion in the drug/solvent admixture, and (3) evaporation of the solvent. In practice, this method has proved to have several disadvantages.First, for many drugs, the solvent selected is necessarily organic, rather than aqueous. As many organic solvents are flammable and/or toxic, an element of risk is thus introduced into device fabrication and use. Another shortcoming is that with volatile drugs or drugs that are sensitive to heat, evaporation of

CLAIMS
1. A transdermal drug delivery device for administering a drug to a human patient, transdermally and continuously for a period of approximately 14 to 18 hours, the device being comprised of a laminated composite, comprising:
(a) a backing layer that is substantially impermeable to the drug, which backing layer defines an upper surface of the device;
(b) a layer of a pressure-sensitive, pharmaceutically acceptable, contact adhesive which is permeable to the drug, and which defines a basal surface of the device to be adhered to the skin of the human patient; wherein the drug is dispersed throughout the adhesive and is present in a concentration such that the drug will, after 14 to 18 hours of contact with the patient, be depleted to the extent that delivery of the drug to the patient is slowed to a rate such that the effect of nicotine on the patient is negligible.
2. The device of claim 1, wherein the drug is nicotine.
3. The device of claim 2, wherein the nicotine is dispersed in the adhesive in an amount in the range of 0.70 to about 1.15 mg/cm
2
.
4. The device of claim 3, wherein the nicotine is dispersed in the adhesive in an amount in the range of 0.75 to 0.95 mg/cm
2
.
5. The device of claim 4, wherein the nicotine is dispersed in the adhesive in an amount of about 0.83 mg/cm
2
. 


 6. The device of claim 1, wherein the drug is nicotine, the nicotine is delivered continuously for a period of approximately 16 hours, and the nicotine is dispersed in the adhesive in an amount in the range of about 0.75 to 0.95 mg/cm
