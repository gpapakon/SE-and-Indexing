<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an infusion pump (23) to be implanted in the body of a patient for drug therapy. The device has at least one puncturing site (21, 22) for filling a storage container for storage of a chosen drug and it comprises a liquid-conveying device for transport of the drug from the storage container. Furthermore, the device comprises at least one means for the limited introduction of the selected drug, coming from the storage container in which it is stored, into the body. It is the object of the invention to render the filling of the storage tank for the drug to be administered through the puncturing site (21, 22) provided on the storage container and for a bolus septum reliable and problem-free. This is achieved in that at least one extracorporeally detectable device (24, 25) is arranged around or on at least one of the puncturing sites (21, 22) provided in the infusion pump (23), so that the position of the puncturing site can be determined extracorporeally for injection into this puncturing site.
