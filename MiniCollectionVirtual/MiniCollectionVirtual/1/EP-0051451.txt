<ABSTRACT>
Prosthetic heart valves having a low profile are disclosed 
which comprise an annular, right cylindrical, metal stent 

covered with fabric around which a glutaraldehyde-stabilized 
pericardial valving element is attached. The valving element 

is formed of three leaflets, each having a plateau on a 
truncated triangle extending higher at the center than at the 

edges, and formed as a cylinder having a diameter substan­
tially equal to the diameter of the stent. In a preferred 

embodiment of the invention, the stent has upright legs 
which have radiused upper tips which are approximately 

one-half the width of prior art stent legs. These narrow 
tipped stent legs reduce stress induced in the leaflets by 

curvature of the leaflets around the tips of the stent legs in 
the closed position, extending the service life of the valve. 

Tabs are added to the tips of the stent legs to add structural 
strength. These tabs can be tapered or straight but their 

bottom portions must be narrower than the stent legs. The 
tabs have a plurality of holes in them through which 

coaptation stitches are passed. The coaptation stitch can be 
two separate stitches, one in a first plane and one in a second 

plane at 90° to the first plane, or, in the preferred embodi­
ment, a single figure eight stitch passing through the holes in 

the tab in a plane coincident with the long axis of the stent 
leg.
