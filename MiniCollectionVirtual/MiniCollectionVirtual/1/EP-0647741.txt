<ABSTRACT>
A protection for a flush-mounted device (1), such as a flush-mounted siphon (1), is, in order to achieve optimum protection with simple means and for the purpose of releasing the flush-mounted device as soon as the protection is no longer required, designed as a thin-walled protective cap (12) which exhibits an end wall (13) and a peripheral wall (14) which adjoins said end wall and encases an interior (11), the protective cap (12) being supported on the flush-mounted device (1) (Figure 1).

<CLAIMS>
A protection for flush-mounted devices, comprising a protective hood (12) having a
thin wall and having a front wall (13) and an adjacent cirumferential wall (14) enclosing an

interior space, and a flush-mounted device, in particular a flush-mounted siphon (1) or a
floor drain with a casing (2), 
characterized in that
 the flush-mounted device (1) is used for
forming a protection for flush-mounted devices, which is closed on all sides, by the

protective hood (12) being based on the casing (2) of the flush-mounted device (1),
preferably via the circumferential wall (14).
A means according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the front wall (13) and the
circumferential wall (14) have a maximum thickness of 2 mm, in particular a thickness of

between 0.5 and 1.5 mm.
A means according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the protective hood (12) is
made of plastic material, in particular polypropylene or recycling plastic.
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the
protective hood (12) is produced by the injection moulding method.
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 the
circumferential wall (14) may be embedded in a wall by its free edge (16), which preferably

has a bead (17) projecting outwardly.
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the free
edge (16) of the circumferential wall (14) is adapted to the outer contour of a flush-mounted

device (1).
A means according to one or several of claims I to 6, 
characterized in that
 the free
edge (16) of the circumferential wall (14) is based on the flush-mounted device (1).
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the
protective hood (12) by its free edge (16) is pushed on the flush-mounted device (1). 
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the free
edge (16) of the circumferential wall (14) is connected with the flush-mounted device (1) by

means of a snap connection.
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that
 the free
edge (16) of the circumferential wall (14) is, at least in some places, connected with the

flush-mounted device (1) by a weld joint.
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the
circumferential wall (14) of the protective hood has a portion (14') embedded in a wall of the

building (15) and a circumferential-wall portion (14") projecting beyond the surface (25) of
the building (15).
A means according to claim 11, 
characterized in that
 at least the circumferential-wall
portion (14"), which projects from the building (15), is provided with ribs (18) that are

parallel to each other and with grooves (19) located between the ribs (18), which extend
approximately parallel to the surface (25) of the building or the front wall (13) of the

protective hood (12).
A means according to claim 12, 
characterized in that
 the ribs (18) and grooves (19)
are arranged only in the area (14") which may maximally project from the building.
A means according to claim 12 or 13, 
characterized in that
 the wall thickness at the
groove bottom is 1 mm at the most, preferably 0.5 mm at the most.
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that
 the
grooves (19) are interrupted by slot-shaped recesses (21) which intersperse the

circumferential wall (14).
A means according to claim 15, 
characterized in that
 the recesses (21) have a
minimum length of 10 mm.
A means according to claim 15 or 16, 
characterized in that
 the recesses (21) of a
groove (19) are staggered relative to the recesses (21) of an adjacent groove (19).

characterized in that
 the
circumferential wall (14) on the inside is provided with one or more stiffening ribs (22). 
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 18, 
characterized in that
 the front
wall (13) is provided with stiffening ribs (23) which preferably extend over the front wall

(13) in the form of a star or cross.
A means according to claim 19, 
characterized in that
 the stiffening ribs are
configured in the form of corrugations.
A means according to claim 19, 
characterized in that
 the stiffening ribs (22, 23) are

based on the circumferential wall (14) and the front wall (13) and are configured in one piece
with these.
A means according to one or several of claims 1 to 21, 
characterized in that
 the front
wall (13) has a hat-shaped enlargement (24) projecting outwardly into which there may be
