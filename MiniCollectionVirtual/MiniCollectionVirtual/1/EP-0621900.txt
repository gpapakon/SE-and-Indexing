<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of Glyoxylic acid from glycolic acid where an aqueous solution of about 200 to 2500 mM glycolic acid at a pH of 7 to 10, at 0 DEG  to 40  DEG C is contacted with an effective amount of whole microbial cells (e.g., Aspergillus nidulans, Pichia pastoris, Hansenula polymorpha and Escherichia coli) which as a result of genetic engineering expresses the enzyme glycolate oxidase, (S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase (EC 1.1.3.15), to achieve an effective concentration range of 0.01 to about 100 IU/mL and optionally expresses an endogenous catalase (EC 1.11.1.6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process for the production of 
glyoxylic acid by the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of glycolic acid. More specifically, 
the present invention relates to the use of whole cells of a genetically-engineered 
microbial transformant, which expresses the enzyme glycolate oxidase [(S)-2-hydroxy-acid 
oxidase, EC 1.1.3.15], and, optionally, catalase (EC 1.11.1.6). Glycolate oxidase, an enzyme commonly found in leafy green plants 
and mammalian cells, catalyzes the oxidation of glycolic acid to glyoxylic acid, with 
the concomitant production of hydrogen peroxide. N. E. Tolbert et. al., J. Biol. 
Chem., Vol. 181, 905-914 (1949) first reported an enzyme, extracted from tobacco 
leaves, which catalyzed the oxidation of glycolic acid to formic acid and CO2 via the 
intermediate formation of glyoxylic acid. The addition of certain compounds, such 
as ethylenediamine, limited the further oxidation of the intermediate glyoxylic acid. 
The oxidations were carried out at a pH of about 8, typically using glycolic acid 
concentrations of about 3-40 mM (millimolar). The optimum pH for the glycolate 
oxidation was reported to be 8.9. Oxalic acid (100 mM) was reported to inhibit the 
catalytic action of the glycolate oxidase. Similarly, K. E. Richardson and N. E. 
Tolbert, J. Biol. Chem., vol. 236, 1280-1284 (1961) showed that buffers containing 
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane inhibited the formation of oxalic acid in the 
glycolate oxidase catalyzed oxidation of glycolic acid. C. O. Clagett, N. E. Tolbert 
and R. H. Burris, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 178, 977-987 (1949) reported that the 
optimum pH for the glycolate oxidase catalyzed oxidation of glycolic add with 
oxygen was about 7.8 - 8.6, and the optimum temperature was 35-40°C. I. Zelitch and S. Ochoa, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 201, 707-718 (1953), and 
J. C. Robinson et. al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 237, 2001-2009 (1962), reported that the 
formation of formic acid and CO2 in the spinach glycolate oxidase-catalyzed 
oxidation of glycolic acid resulted from the nonenzymatic reaction of H2O2 with 
glyoxylic acid. They observed that addition of catalase, an enzyme that catalyzes the 
decomposition of H2O2, greatly improved the yields of glyoxylic acid by suppressing 
the formation of formic acid and CO2. The addition of flavin mononudeotide  
 
(FMN) was also found to greatly increase the stability of the glycolate oxidase. N. A. Frigerio and H. A. Harbury, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 231, 135-157 (1958) 
have reported on the preparation and properties
