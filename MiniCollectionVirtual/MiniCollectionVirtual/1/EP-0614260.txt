<ABSTRACT>
A series of substations (RMU-RTU-1,...) which are in each case connected to at least one network operating means (NB1,...) for monitoring and control are connected to a central control unit (ZSE). A data bus (DB) of the control unit has coupling transformers (KU) which are connected to the earthed cable screen (KE) at the ends of cable paths (NK1,...) which are used for power transmission, and result in data being injected or output from the respective earth circuits (ES1,...). The control unit (ZSE) cyclically supplies a "group interrogation message" (GAT) into the data bus (DB). In each substation (RMU-RTU-1,...), this message triggers the transmission of a separate "response message" (AT1,...) to the control unit. Changes in the status (STI) of the connected network operating means (NB1,...) are entered therein. The group interrogation message (GAT) is passed on from substation to substation. The control unit (ZSE) can reconstruct the operating condition of the power supply network in series from the received response messages from all the substations.
