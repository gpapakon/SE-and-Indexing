<ABSTRACT>
A switch assembly comprises a relatively fixed component (16), a first 
switch operating member (17) rotatable relative to the fixed component 

(16) between first and second stable positions, a second switch operating 
member (15) rotatable with respect to the fixed component (16) between 

first and second stable positions, switch contacts associated with each of 
the switch operating members (15, 17) in order to control the operation 

of respective electrical circuits, and means (32, 47) responsive to the first 
operating member (17) occupying its first position for applying a moment 

to the second operating member (15) to restore it to its first position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary switch assembly, primarily, but not
exclusively, intended for use as a lighting control switch for a road
vehicle.It is known to provide a rotary switch assembly where a rotatable
operating member has three stable positions corresponding respectively
to a off position, a side lights on position, and a side lights and
headlights on condition. It is also known to provide a switching
assembly for controlling fog lights of the vehicle the assembly having
positions in which the fog lights are off; only the front fog lights are on;
both front and rear fog lights are on. EP 0446126 discloses a switch
assembly in which a specific movement of one switch operating member
drives a second switch operating member by way of a mechanical drive
connection between the operating members.It is an object of the present invention to provide a rotary switch
assembly having a first operating member which can be used to control
energisation of the side lights and headlights of the vehicle, a second
operating member which can be used to control energisation of the front
and rear fog lights of the vehicle, and means ensuring that the second
operating member is returned to its off position when the first operating
member is in its off position.In accordance with the present invention there is provided a rotary
switch assembly as defined in claim 1. The switch assembly preferably further comprises a latch member
movable, by positioning the first operating member in said first stable
position, between a latched position and an unlatched position in which
said resilient means applies said moment to the second operating
member to restore it to its first position. The latch member is preferably
resiliently biased towards its latched position.Preferably, the latch member is biased so as to rotate with respect to the
first component when in its unlatched position in order to restore the
second operating member to its first position.The latch member is preferably provided with a tooth arranged to engage
with a selected one of a plurality of recesses provided in the first
component when the latch member is in its latched position, and to be
disengaged therefrom when in its unlatched position.The switch assembly preferably further comprises actuator means
associated with the first operating member arranged to move the latch
member to its unlatched position when the first operating member is in
its first position, the actuator means preferably comprising at least one
prong arranged to engage the latch
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A rotary switch assembly including a first, relatively fixed component
(16), a first switch operating member (17) rotatable relative to said first

component (16) between first and second stable positions, electrical
switch contacts operable by said first operating member (17), a second

switch operating member (15) rotatable relative to said first component
(16) between first and second positions, further switch contacts (19, 19
a
)
operable by said second operating member (15), the switch being

characterized by the provision of resilient means (36) responsive to the
positioning of the first operating member (17) in said first stable position

for applying a moment to the second operating member (15) to restore
the second operating member (15) to its first position.
A switch assembly as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by a
latch member (32) movable, by positioning of the first operating member

(17) in said first position, between a latched position and an unlatched
position in which said resilient means applies said moment to the second

operating member (15) to restore it to its first position.
A switch assembly as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that
the latch member (32) is resiliently biased towards its latched position.
A switch assembly as claimed in Claim 2 or Claim 3,
characterized in that the latch member (32) is biased by said resilient

means (36) so as to rotate with respect to the first component (16) when
in its unlatched position and rotates the second operating member (15)

with it in order to restore the second operating member (15) to its first
position. 
A switch assembly as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that the latch member (32) is provided with a tooth (43)

arranged to engage with a selected one of a plurality of recesses (44, 45
46) provided in the first component (16) when the latch member (32) is

in its latched position, and to be disengaged therefrom when in its
unlatched position.
A switch assembly as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterized by actuator means (47) associated with the first operating

member (17) arranged to move the latch member (32) to its unlatched
position when the first operating member (17) is in its first position.
A switch assembly as claimed in Claim 6, characterized in that
the actuator means (47) comprises at least one prong (49) arranged to

engage the latch member (32), the prong (49) being reciprocable under
the influence of a cam surface (54) provided on the first operating

member (17).
A switch assembly as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the first and second operating members

(15, 17) are coaxial with one another.
A switch assembly as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, characterized by detent means (27, 56) arranged to define

predetermined rotational positions of the first and second operating
members (15, 17) relative to said first component (16).
