<ABSTRACT>
A pattern of mask is formed on the surface of a transparent 
insulating substrate by means of an optical system 

that uses an excimer layer as a light source. By the interaction 
between light and film material, the film material 

struck by light is removed and dispersed in the form of 
gases or fine particle
s, thus forming the gate lines and 
gate terminals of thin-film transistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an 
apparatus for producing thin-film transistors and more 
particularly of liquid crystal display devices of active 
matrix type using thin film transistors (TFTs) or the like. In a liquid crystal display device of active matrix 
type, non-linear devices (e.g., switching devices) are disposed 
in a manner to correspond to a plurality of pixel 
electrodes arranged in matrix, respectively. The liquid 
crystal in each pixel is always drive, in principle, (at a 
duty ratio of 1.0). In comparison with the so-called "simple 
matrix type" which employs a time division driving system, 
therefore, the active system has better contrast and 
has become an indispensable technique particularly in a 
color liquid crystal display device. A typical example of 
the switching devices is a thin film transistor (TFT). Here, the liquid crystal display device of active matrix 
type using the thin film transistors is known in Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No. 309921/1988 or on pp. 193 to 210 
of Nikkei Electronics entitled "Active Matrix Type Color  
 
Liquid Crystal Display of 12.5 Type Adopting Redundant Construction" 
and issued on December 15, 1986 by NIKKEI 
McGRAW-HILL, for example. Patterns of layers in a conventional TFT substrate, 
as described in the above-mentioned publication, are 
formed by photolithography, a technique commonly used in 
semiconductor device fabrication which consists of a 
series of processes including resist coating, baking, exposure, 
development, etching, resist removal and cleaning. Since the excimer laser was first made public in 
1982, many studies have been conducted on its application 
to the manufacturing processes. Example applications of 
the excimer laser include marking glasses and ceramics and 
processing polymer films and ceramic and glass materials. 
There are many publications concerning the excimer laser, 
but as far as the inventors know, no published literatures 
exist that explicitly describe the application of the 
excimer to the patterning of thin-film transistor arrays 
and liquid crystal display panels. As mentioned above, because the conventional TFT liquid 
crystal display panel requires a large-scale facility 
and because the display panel requires a large substrate, 
the manufacturing cost far exceeds that of a cathode ray 
tube. To promote spread of the liquid crystal display panels, 
cost reduction is essential. The approach for promoting 
an increased use has generally been directed to  
 
improving the cleanliness of
