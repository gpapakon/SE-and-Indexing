<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic circuit comprising a BiCMOS driver 
circuit that includes an input for receiving an input signal; first and second outputs to 
provide complementary output signals in response to the input signal; and first and 
second bipolar push-pull stages driving the first and second outputs, respectively. A major problem in CMOS/BiCMOS IC design is how to drive a large 
capacitive load (such as a gate array) from a driver with low input capacitance -- i.e., 
how to make big signals from small ones. Furthermore, it is often convenient to have 
complementary signal outputs with very low skew in propagation, meaning that the 
propagation delays for both outputs are substantially the same. This is important in such 
applications as, for example, generating both clock phases for latches and flip-flops. The standard CMOS and BiCMOS solution of staging inverters is 
unsatisfactory due to the propagation delay through each stage and the inherent skew 
between complementary signals. U.S. Patent 4,937,480 shows another approach in its Figure 1 relating to 
a BiCMOS circuit for translating a single input to two complementary outputs. The 
BiCMOS circuit is a completely symmetric device. The single input signal is first 
translated to two voltage levels by a differential amplifier that in turn controls a bistable 
element. The bistable element has its output nodes connected to respective ones of 
cross-coupled output circuits that are mutually identical. European Patent Application 0,239,762 shows a circuit 
as claimed in the preamble of claim 1. The differential amplifier in the known circuit always consumes a 
substantial amount of power, even in a steady state. The faster the switching is to be, 
the larger the tail current of a differential transistor pair needs to be and, consequently, 
the larger the steady state power consumption. The translation in the prior art circuit is 
based on the use of a multitude of different supply voltages VEE, VE1, GND, and a 
plurality of different reference voltages VBE, VBBC, VBB, VCS2.  
 Apart from the power consumption due to the differential transistor pairs, 
the circuit of the prior art has as an additional disadvantage that its operation is 
determined to a large extent by the accuracy of the supply voltages and the control 
voltages. Furthermore, the prior art circuit requires extra substrate area to accommodate 
generators or supply lines for these voltages. An object of the invention is to provide a BiCMOS line driver circuit with 
low
