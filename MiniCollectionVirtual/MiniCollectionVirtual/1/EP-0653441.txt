<ABSTRACT>
A polymer scale preventive agent for use in polymerization 
of a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated double 

bond, comprising a naphthoquinone dimer compound. This 
agent is applied to the inner wall surfaces of a 

polymerization vessel to form a coating. Such a vessel is 
effective in preventing polymer scale deposition, not only 

on the areas located in the liquid-phase region but also on 
the areas around the interface between the gas and liquid 

phases in the vessel, and useful in producing a polymer 
that shows few fish eyes and good whiteness when formed 

into sheets or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of a naphthoquinone
dimer compound as a polymer scale preventive agent in polymerization
of a monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated
double bond, and a process for producing a polymer using the
same.Heretofore, methods for polymerization of a monomer
having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond have been
known, such as suspension, emulsion, solution, gas phase
and bulk polymerization processes and the like. In any of
these polymerization processes, polymer scale is liable to
be deposited on the areas with which the monomer comes into
contact, such as inner walls, stirring equipment and so on
of a polymerization vessel.The deposition of the polymer scale results in
disadvantages that the yield of the polymer and cooling
capacity of the polymerization vessel are lowered, and that
the polymer scale may peel off and mix into a polymeric
product, thereby impairing the quality of formed products
obtained by processing the polymeric product. In addition,
removal of deposited polymer scale is very laborious and
time-consuming. Further, the polymer scale contains
unreacted monomers and, therefore, may cause physical
disorders in the operators, which has been a very serious 
problem in recent years.For preventing polymer scale deposition on the
polymerization vessel inner wall and so forth, methods have
been known, for example, a method in which a polymer scale
preventive agent comprising a polar organic compound such
as amine compounds, quinone compounds, aldehyde compounds,
etc. is applied to the polymerization vessel inner wall and
so on to form a coating and a method in which such
compounds are added to an aqueous medium in which
suspension polymerization is carried out (Japanese Patent
Publication (KOKOKU) No. 45-30343, as practiced in some
instances of suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride.However, these methods have the disadvantage that,
although the polymer scale preventive effect is exhibited
while polymerization is repeated for up to about 5 or 6
batches, the effect diminishes if the number of repeated
batches of polymerization exceeds 5 or 6 (that is, the
scale preventive effect is poor in durability). The
disadvantage is emphasized particularly where a water-soluble
catalyst is used for polymerization, and, in this
point, the polymer scale prevention according to these
methods is unsatisfactory industrially.For overcoming the above disadvantage, Japanese Pre-examination
Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 53-13689
proposes a method in which the inner
