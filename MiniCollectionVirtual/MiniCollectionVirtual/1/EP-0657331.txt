<ABSTRACT>
Two wiper rubber blades (1) are united with each other at lip portions (8) 
so as to form a tandem wiper rubber blade (11), and notches (12a, 12b) are 

provided on both sides of a common lip portion (13) at the center portion 
thereof. By providing the notches (12a, 12b), a joint portion of the two wiper 

rubber blades is formed, which enables the tandem wiper rubber blade to be 
easily torn.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of producing
a wiper rubber blade which is excellent in the wiping
ability, the durability and also in the productivity.A wiper rubber blade is generally swept across the
glass surface of a vehicle to wipe out the raindrops or the
like on the windshield. Therefore wiper rubber blades
having a low frictional resistance and difficult to abrade
are to be desired.Since a wiper rubber blade is disposed on the outside
of a vehicle, it is also required to have a resistance to
ozone and a resistance to weather.Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a conventional wiper
rubber blade. In Fig. 6, the reference numeral 1 represents
a wiper rubber blade, and 2 a base end portion which engages
a holding fixture (not shown). The reference numeral 3
represents a neck portion, 4 a rocking portion, 5 a lip
portion and 5a the edge thereof. As the wiper rubber blade 1, a molded product of
natural rubber or synthetic rubber is used. In a wiper
rubber blade having natural rubber as the base material, the
frictional resistance is lowered and the abrasion resistance
is improved by subjecting the surface of the rubber blade to
a chlorination treatment or a fluorination treatment, or by
forming a coating layer 6 on the surface, as shown in
Fig. 8.In a wiper rubber blade having synthetic rubber such as
ethylene propylene rubber (EPDM) as the base material,
although the weathering resistance is excellent, since the
effect of a chlorination treatment on the reduction of the
frictional resistance cannot be expected, it is subjected to
a fluorination treatment so as to lower the frictional
resistance and improve the abrasion resistance.In order to enhance the productivity of a wiper rubber
blade, what is called a tandem wiper rubber blade such as
that shown in Fig. 9 has been proposed. The tandem rubber
blade 7 shown in Fig. 9 is composed of two wiper rubber
blades 1 united with each other at the lip portions 5. The
surface of a common lip portion 8 of the tandem wiper rubber
blade 7 is subjected to a coating treatment such as described
above so as to provide a coating film.The common lip portion 8 of the tandem wiper rubber
blade 7 subjected to the coating treatment is mounted on a 
bearer 9, and the tandem wiper rubber blade 7 is separated
into two wiper rubber blades 1 by pressing a long knife
blade 10 against the center portion of the common lip
portion 8, as shown in Fig. 10. Such a treatment is called
a "before-cutting-coating treatment".In contrast, in what is called an

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing a wiper rubber blade comprising
the steps of: providing a tandem wiper rubber blade (11)

which is composed of two wiper rubber blades (1) integrally
united with each other at their lip portions so as to form

a common lip portion (8); forming notches (12a, 12b) on
both sides of said common lip portion (8) by cutting with

knives (14, 15); and thereafter applying a coating material
to said common lip portion (8).
The method as claimed in claim 1, comprising the further
step of tearing said common lip portion (8) along said

notches (12a, 12b) so as to obtain two separated wiper
rubber blades (1) each having a lip portion with an uncoated

edge surface (5a).
The method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said
notches (12a, 12b) are formed by cutting the side surfaces

of said common lip portion (8) by an upper rotary knife
(14) and a lower rotary knife (15).
The methode as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
coating material is selected from the group consisting of

graphite, molybdenum, nylon and polytetrafluoroethylene.
