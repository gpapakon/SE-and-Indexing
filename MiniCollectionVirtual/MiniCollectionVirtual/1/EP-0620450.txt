<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a system for detecting modulated laser
signals.US-Patent 5,142,142 discloses a laser detection device processing optical pulses
sensed by a photo diode. The pulse width of the respective pulses is used as a detecting
criterium. Delay circuitry and switching flip flop circuits serve for maintaining desired
detection operation under special pulse interval conditions.The publication IEE Proceedings F Communications, Radar & Signal Processing;
vol 136, no. 4, August 1989, New York, NY, USA, pages 149-154 Mardia.-"New
Techniques for the deinterleaving of repetitive sequences" discloses a system for
deinterleaving of interleaved radar signals from a plurality of signal sources in order to
identify the respective signals. This known technique measures differences of time of
arrival of radar pulses, i.e., measures pulse intervals and counts up occurrences of
respective different ones of intervals for a sequence search algorithm which leads to
deinterleaving of the pulse sequence. This known system is not usable for detecting
modulated laser signals with high sensitivity.Many modern weapon systems employ modulated laser signals to locate and/or
aim a weapon at a target. As used herein the term "modulated" includes laser signals
that are generated either by pulsing a laser on and off or by chopping the output of a
continuous wave laser. Ordinarily, the modulated laser signals generated by pulsing the
laser on and off will result in a signal having relatively short high intensity pulses 
spaced apart by long intervals. The modulated laser signal generated by chopping a
continuous wave laser usually has relatively longer pulses than that of the pulsed laser.It is therefore quite important to be able to detect the presence of modulated laser
signals reliably and rapidly.Presently, modulated laser signals are detected by systems that have a single
channel. The system counts the temporal interval between successive detected pulses
and stores, or bins, the information according to the interval between each pulse. When
the number of occurrences of any given pulse interval reaches a preselected threshold
the system indicates the presence of as modulated laser signal.Such a system has a number of drawbacks, the first of which is the fact that only
the occurrence of one specific pulse interval, i.e., information from only on bin, is used
to determine the presence of a modulated signal while information from other bins is not
used to make a determination. This approach results in
