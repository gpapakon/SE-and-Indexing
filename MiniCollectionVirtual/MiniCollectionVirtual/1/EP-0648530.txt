<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method and installation for the production of a desired 
fluorocarbon compound, which includes the steps of providing a high temperature zone; 

and feeding at least one input material into the high temperature zone to generate a 
body of hot gas including fluorine-containing species and carbon-containing species. 

The molar C:F ratio in the body of hot gas is controlled at a selected value between 
about 0,4 and 2; and the specific en
thalpy of the body of hot gas is controlled between 
about 1kWh/kg and about 10kWh/kg for a time interval, so that a reactive thermal 

gaseous mixture forms, containing reactive species including reactive fluorine-containing 
precursors and reactive carbon-containing precursors. Thereafter the reactive thermal 

mixture is cooled at a cooling rate and to a cooling temperature selected to produce an 
end product including the desired fluorocarbon compound. 
The input material is typically a C₁-C₁₀ perfluorinated carbon compound of the 
general formula C

THIS INVENTION relates to a method for the production of fluorocarbon
compounds, and to an installation for the production of fluorocarbon compounds. More
particularly, the invention relates to a method and to an installation for the continuous
selective production of desired fluorocarbon compounds with minimal effluent
production.The Applicant is aware of US-A-3081245, FR-A-1154180, FR-A-1154181 and
US-A-5147998. US-A-3081245 teaches a method for synthesizing tetrafluoroethylene
from a saturated fluorocarbon such as carbon tetrafluoride. The carbon tetrafluoride
is introduced, on its own, into an electric arc, and the resultant products are passed
through a carbon bed to quench the products and produce the tetrafluoroethylene.
FR-A-11541780 and FR-A-1154181 teach the preparation of tetrafluoroethylene which
includes pyrolyzing a fluorine compound at high temperature using graphite or carbon
electrodes, ie consumable electrodes. Additionally, they teach using particulate carbon
material as a quench for the hot product. US-A-5147998 teaches a plasma torch
comprising a torch housing, a rear tubular anode electrode, a front tubular cathode
electrode, a vortex generator for introducing a tangential flow of gas in opposite
direction into the tubular electrode between the two electrodes, and a cooling system
for cooling the electrodes. It does not at all teach treating a particular feedstock to
produce particular products.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for the
production of a fluorocarbon compound, which method includes
generating, in a high temperature zone, an electrical arc between at least one
pair of electrodes;feeding into the high temperature zone at least one input material with which to
generate a thermal plasma containing fluorine-containing species and carbon-containing
species; generating, in the high temperature zone, the thermal plasma which contains
fluorine-containing species and carbon-containing species;
characterised in thatthe electrodes are substantially non-consumable;a particulate carbon-containing substance is mixed, under controlled enthalpy
conditions, with the thermal plasma, to forma reactive thermal mixture having a molar
C:F ratio between 0,4 and 2, and a specific enthalpy between about 1kWh/kg and about
10kWh/kg;controlling said specific enthalpy for a time interval to cause the reaction thermal
mixture to be gaseous, the reactive thermal gaseous mixture containing reactive species
including fluorine-containing precursors and
