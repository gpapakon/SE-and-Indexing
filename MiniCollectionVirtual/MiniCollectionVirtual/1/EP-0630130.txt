<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for control of concurrent communication of analog 
information and digital informati
on. In general terms, when the communication channel is 
viewed as a multi-dimensional space, the digital information signal is divided into symbols, 

and the symbols are mapped onto the signal space with a preset distance between them. 
The analog signal, generally limited in magnitude to less than the distance separating the 

symbols, is converted to component signals and added (i.e., vector addition) to the 
symbols. The sum signal is then transmitted to the receiver where the symbols are 

detected and subtracted from the received signal to yield the analog signal components. 
The transmitted analog signal is recreated from those components. Both half-duplex and 

full-duplex operation is available in accordance with this invention. The illustrative 
embodiment includes control means that is sensitive to input signals applied to the modem 

disclosed herein. To wit, the control is sensitive to signals from the analog port, signals 
from the digital port, and signals from the port that carries the combined digital and analog 

signals. Operation of the near-end modem is controlled as well as operation of the far-end 
modem.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to an application titled SIMULTANEOUS ANALOG 
AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATION, filed on even date hereof. This invention relates to simultaneous transmission of analog and digital signals 
and, more particularly, to controlled simultaneous transmission of analog signals and 
digital signals in a non-multiplexed manner and in a generally co-extensive frequency band. In the prior art, when voice and data is transmitted simultaneously over a channel, 
it is typically transmitted either via frequency-division multiplexing or time-division 
multiplexing. In frequency-division multiplexing, the data channel and the voice channel 
are allocated different sub-bands of the channel's bandwidth. Examples of that are U.S. 
Patent No. 4,757,495, U. S. Patent 4,672,602, and U. S. Patent 4,546,212. In time-division 
multiplexing arrangements, voice signals are sampled, digitized and interleaved 
with digital data to form a single information stream which is communicated over the 
available channel. Practically every digital carrier system (e.g. the T1 carrier system) is an 
example of that. U.S. Patent No. 4,512,013, issued April 16, 1985, presents an interesting approach 
that is close to a frequency division multiplexing arrangement for simultaneous voice and 
data. The arrangement filters the speech signal and adds thereto a modulated narrowband 
signal to form the transmitted signal. The narrowband modulated signal derives from a 
narrowband digital input signal that is modulated with a carrier, thereby shifting the 
narrow-band up in frequency to a position in the spectrum where there is little speech 
energy. At the receiver, in reliance of the fact that the speech power is low in the 
narrowband occupied by the modulated digital signal, the digital signal is recovered 
through appropriate demodulation. Thereafter, the recovered digital signal is remodulated 
to replicate the transmitter's operation, adaptively filtered to account for channel 
characteristics, and subtracted from the received signal. The result is the received speech. 
As indicated above, one salient characteristic of that arrangement, as stated in col. 2, lines 
13-18, is that "...an entire analog speech signal and a modulated data signal are capable of  
 
being transmitted over a normal analog channel by the multiplexing of the data signal 
within the portion of the normal analog speech signal frequency band where the speech 
signal is present and the power density characteristic thereof is low". As an aside, the
