<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mouthpiece for inhalation therapy apparatus. The basic body (1) of the mouthpiece is provided with an opening (14) which is intended for an expiration process directed into the mouthpiece and through which the breathing air can escape. The opening (14) is covered by a flat, elastic valve element (12) of a non-return valve (11) in such a way that the wall of the basic body (1) which is missing in the region of the opening (14) is essentially reproduced. This ensures that the flow conditions inside the mouthpiece remain virtually unaffected by the opening (14) when the flat, elastic valve element (12) rests flatly upon a plane wall member of the basic body (1) during an inspiration process, and seals off the opening (14).

Mouthpiece of an aerosol inhalation therapy unit having a basic body (1) of essentially
tubular shape with an essentially flat wall section in which is configured an opening

(14) with a surrounding edge section (14a) which extends into the opening (14) and
having a non-return valve (11) for sealing the opening (14) during an inhalation

procedure through the mouthpiece and for removing exhaled air through the opening
(14) during an exhalation procedure directed into the mouthpiece, which non-return

valve (11) includes a flat, elastic valve element,

which is fastened to the basic body (1) in the region of the flat wall section in such
a way


that, in an at-rest position, it is in contact with the basic body (1) from the
outside because of the elastic forces operating and thus closes the opening

(14), and
that it can be partially lifted from the basic body in order to free the opening
(14),
which valve element is matched in dimensions and shape to the opening (14) in
order to close the latter, and
which valve element, in the at-rest position, is in contact with the edge section
(14a) in such a way that the flat, elastic valve element (12) is essentially arranged

within the opening (14).
Mouthpiece according to Claim 1, characterised in that the basic body (1) has a connection
region (1a) for connecting together the mouthpiece onto the inhalation therapy

unit, an ergonomically shaped region (1c) (to be taken into the mouth) and a transition
region (1b) for converting the shape of the connection region (1a) into the shape of the

ergonomically shaped region (1c), and in that the essentially flat wall section, in which
the opening (14) is configured, is arranged in the transition region (1
b
).
Mouthpiece according to Claim 1, characterised in that the flat elastic valve element
(12) is held externally on the basic body (1) by means of a clamping device (13). 
Mouthpiece according to Claim 1, characterised in that there is a valve element cover
(13a) integrally formed on the clamping device (13), which valve element cover (13a) is

arranged externally on the basic body (1) above the valve element (12) in order to
protect the flat, elastic valve element.
Mouthpiece according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the edge section
(14a) is provided with a circumferential sealing lip.
Mouthpiece according to one of Claims 3 to 5, characterised in that the flat elastic valve
element (12) has a locking opening (15), in that the basic body (1) has a locking

opening (16) and in that the clamping device (13) can be folded from an open position
into a position clamping the valve element and has a locking projection (13b) which, in

the position of the clamping device (13) which clamps the valve element, engages in the
mutually aligned locking openings (15, 16) of the valve element (12) and the basic

body (1).
Mouthpiece according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the flat, elastic
valve element (12) has two layers (12a, 12b) of which, in the at-rest position of the

valve element (12), the first layer (12a) is in contact on the outside of the basic body (1)
and the second layer (12b) is arranged in the opening (14) in such a way that the surface

of the second layer (12b) which is directed towards the internal space of the basic body
(1) provides an almost complete continuation of the inner wall of the basic body (1) in

the region of the opening (14).
Mouthpiece according to Claim 7, characterised in that the valve element (12) is constructed
in one piece or is constructed of two separated layers (12a, 12b) which consist

of the same or different materials.
Mouthpiece according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the flat, elastic
valve element (12) is manufactured from a plastic or rubber.
