<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of chromic 
tripicolinate for weight reduction and weight maintenance of obese 
diabetic patients. USP 5 087 624 discloses that chromic picolinate, preferably 
chromic tripicolinate, can be used as an anabolic agent in animals 
including humans to increase lean body mass and concomitantly 
decrease the percentage of body fat. This is supported by data 
presented in Example 5 and illustrated by Figures 12 and 13. Under 
the conditions of the study, the body weight of the group given 
chromic tripicolinate increased significantly by 2.18 ± 1.34 kg, the 
calculated lean body mass thereof increased significantly by 1.6 kg. USP 5 087 624 also discloses a protocol (Example 4) comparing 
the effects of chromic tripicolinate on subjects with adult onset 
diabetes mellitus with that of placebo treated patients. The results 
show that no significant changes in weight, blood pressure, heart 
rate and temperature occur, but that both haemoglobin A₁C and LDL 
decreased significantly and that HDL and cholesterol trends were 
favourable. It is further suggested by USP 5 087 624 that chromic 
tripicolinate has Glucose Tolerance Factor activity and that it is 
more effective for reduction of elevated serum cholesterol, 
improvement of glucose tolerance and reduction in fasting 
hyperglycemia than other compounds of chromium. Chromic tripicolinate 
has accordingly been suggested for control of certain symptoms  
 
associated with maturity-onset diabetes. Reduced insulin sensitivity or increased insulin resistance is 
associated with the occurrence of obesity, Type II diabetes, 
hyperlipidemia, hypertension and coronary artery disease. Obese patients have an increased insulin concentration in their 
blood plasma, they are hyperinsulinemic. Obese diabetic patients have an increased insulin and glucose in 
their blood plasma, they are both hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic. It is well known that insulin-stimulated glucose uptake improves 
during weight loss of obese patients with non-insulin-dependent 
diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Weight loss is generally not sustained in these patients, and 
the beneficial effects of weight loss, such as decrease in fasting 
plasma glucose, lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides) and blood 
pressure, are only temporary. It has now been found that the improved insulin sensitivity, 
achieved with weight loss of obese diabetic patients, can be 
maintained by administration of chromic tripicolinate throughout the 
weight maintenance phase (i.e. for the rest
