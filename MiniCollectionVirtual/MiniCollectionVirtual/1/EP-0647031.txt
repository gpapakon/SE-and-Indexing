<ABSTRACT>
The connection circuit comprises a first quadrature-phase comparator (7, 9) intended to receive two signals (I,Q) as input, for which it is desired that they should be in quadrature and of equal amplitude. Phase-adjusting means are first of all provided to correct the phase of at least one of the signals in order to reestablish a phase-shift of 90 DEG  between them. The correction circuit further comprises means (13, 15) for performing the sum and the difference in the signals (I,Q) which it receives as input, and to supply this sum and this difference to a second quadrature-phase comparator (17, 19) provided to supply a second error signal as output representing the discrepancy between the actual phase-shift of these calculated signals and 90 DEG . The second error signal is, finally, fed to amplitude-adjusting means (60, 66) which are intended to correct the amplitude of at least one of the said signals (I,Q).

Phase shift and amplitude correction circuit for
two sinusoidal signals (I, Q) which are desired to be in

quadrature and to have equal amplitudes, said correction
circuit comprising a first quadrature phase comparator (7,

9) provided for receiving as input the two signals and
providing as output a first error signal the voltage of

effective phase shift of said signals and 90°, phase

adjustment means (42) provided for, in response to said
first error signal, correcting the phase of at least one

of said signals to retrieve a phase shift of 90° between
the two signals, amplitude adjustment means (66, 60) also

being provided for correcting the amplitude of one of said
signals, characterized in that said correction circuit

further comprises analogue arithmetic processing means
(13, 15) provided for providing two predetermined linear

combinations of said signals, the respective coefficients
of said predetermined linear combinations being chosen so

that, when said two signals (I, Q) are in quadrature and
have equal amplitudes, said linear combinations are also

in quadrature, and in that said correction circuit further
comprises a second quadrature phase comparator (17, 19)

provided for receiving as input said two linear
combinations and providing as output a second error signal

representative of the difference between the effective
phase shift of said linear combinations and 90°, said

amplitude adjustment means (66, 60) being capable of, in
response to said second error signal, correcting the

amplitude of at least one of said signals to retrieve
identical amplitudes to said signals.
Correction circuit according to claim 1, characterized
in that said analogue arithmetic processing means

(13, 15) include an analogue addition circuit (13) and an
analogue subtraction circuit (15), said two linear

combinations of the signals (I, Q) being the sum of the 
two signals and the difference of the two signals,

respectively.
Correction circuit according to claim 1,
characterized in that said first and second quadrature

phase comparators are each formed of a multiplier (7, 17)
and a low-pass filter (9, 19) connected to the output of

said multiplier.
Generator circuit comprising a correction circuit
according to claim 1 and two oscillators (3, 5) intended

for providing said two sinusoidal signals (I, Q),
respectively, said generator circuit being characterized

in that at least a first (5) of said oscillators is a
voltage controlled oscillator, connected so as to receive

as control voltage said first error signal.
