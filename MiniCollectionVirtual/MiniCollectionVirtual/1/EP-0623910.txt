<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an information carrier for clamping on rods (S), in particular clothes-rails or the like with a retaining clip which with its two first limbs, which are made of resilient material, forms an essentially C-shaped clamping jaw for receiving the rod (S), with at least one second limb, which protrudes into the clamping jaw and with a subregion of its side surface forms a retaining region for acting in a resilient manner on the rod (S), and for the purpose of obtaining a greater range of use the invention proposes that the second limb (3) be integrally formed in a resilient manner on the free end (2') of the first limb (2).

<CLAIMS>
Information carrier for clamping onto rods (S),
particularly clothes rails or the like, with a holding clip

which forms, together with its two first legs (2) made of
a resilient material, a substantially C-shaped clamping

mouth to receive the rod (S), there being resiliently
moulded onto the free end of each of these first legs (2)

a second leg (3) projecting freely into the clamping mouth,
which second leg (3) forms with a partial region of its

concave lateral surface (9) an oval holding region to have
resilient impact on the rod (S), and the opening of the

clamping mouth having two facing run-up slopes (8) each on
an expanding jaw (7) connected to the first leg,


characterised in that
 the expanding jaw (7) forms together
with the second leg (3) a rocker moulded onto the first leg

(2), the run-up slopes (8) pointing outwards independently
of the impact on the rod (S).
Information carrier according to claim 1,

characterised in that
 the second leg (3) has a lesser
spring stiffness than the first leg (2).
Information carrier according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 a snap-in aperture (6), associated
with the holding clip, to detachably receive an information

tag (5).
Information carrier according to one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised by
 a material accumulation (72)
disposed in the second leg (3) and projecting into the

clamping mouth, and which forms a holding surface (13).
Information carrier according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 a right-angled recess (73),
disposed on the side of the opening of the clamping mouth,

to receive an edge of a clothes rail (K') which is
rectangular in cross-section.
Information carrier according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 a support protuberance (71)
disposed in the apex of the U-shape of the clamping mouth.
Information carrier according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised by
 respectively two racing material
accumulations (72) or right-angled recesses (73).
