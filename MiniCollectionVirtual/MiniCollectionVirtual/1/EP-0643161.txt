<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-axial 
fabric comprising a triaxial fabric having two sets of 
obliquely arranged warp yarns of different direction and 
a set of weft yarns, which are interwoven, and a set of 
warp yarns which are transverse to the weft yarns and 
which are interwoven to the weft yarns of the triaxial 
fabric, and further relates to a weaving machine for 
obtaining this fabric. The term "oblique warp yarns" means warp yarns 
which, after being woven to a fabric, run along a 
direction which is oblique with respect to a weft-wise 
direction. The term "straight warp yarns" means warp yarns 
which, after woven to a fabric, run along a direction 
which is transverse to the weft-wise direction. A triaxial fabric is known in, for example, 
USP 4,438,173 by Wayne. In this basic type of a triaxial 
fabric, two sets of oblique warp yarns are interwoven 
with a set of weft yarns. In order to obtain such 
triaxial fabric, a weaving machine is proposed, where a 
pair of opposite, spaced arrays of heddles are provided 
for supporting two sets of oblique warp yarns. The 
heddles are alternately arranged between the opposite 
arrays and are subjected to a reciprocal movement so that 
the heddle between the opposite arrays are crossed with 
each other, which causes a shed to be created to which a 
weft yarn is introduced, to which a beating movement by a 
beater is applied to create a cloth fell. Furthermore, a 
mechanism is provided for obtaining an endless,  
 
alternate, opposite, weft-wise, stepwise movement of the 
opposed arrays of heddles every time after the execution 
of the beating movement, so that, after being interwoven 
to the weft yarns, the oblique warp yarns are arranged 
oblique to the weft direction. Known from Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 63-92751 is a weaving machine 
which includes a pair of delivery rolls defining thereon 
helical grooves for displacing two sets of oblique warp 
yarns (upper oblique warp yarns and lower oblique warp 
yarns) oppositely along the weft direction, a guide roll 
arranged on one side of the delivery rolls adjacent the 
cloth fell for guiding another set of straight warp 
yarns, and push type-heddles of a fork shape for 
obtaining a downward movement of the upper oblique warp 
yarns for creating a shed so that the upper, oblique warp 
yarns are interwoven with the lower weft yarns, and so 
that the lower oblique warp yarns and the straight warp 
yarns are sandwiched between the upper, oblique warp 
yarns and the lower
