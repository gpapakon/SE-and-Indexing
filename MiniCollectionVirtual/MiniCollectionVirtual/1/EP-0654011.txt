<ABSTRACT>
A variable proportion dispenser (2c) includes a housing (12c) which houses two pharmaceutical cartrides (6b). A reciprocating drive assembly includes drive stems (36c) extending from the pistons (46b) of each cartridge, a limit guide (76c) removably mounted to the housing, and a sliding body (66e, 300) mounted to the housing through the limit guide. Two one-way drivers (326) and threaded dosage adjusters (60c) are carried by the sliding body. Each one-way driver drives the drive stem into the cartridge through a drive surface to provide a range of dose selections. The user can thus control the amount and proportion of each pharmaceutical dispensed during each delivery stroke for each dispensing cycle. The housing is separable from the remainder of the dispenser, preferably using a cartridge release assembly (302), to allow spent cartridge to be replaced. Use of the cartridge release assembly also causes the one-way drivers to release the drive stems to permit the drive stems to be returned to their original positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
Frequently a physician will prescribe two or more
medications to be taken by a patient either simultaneously or
as close to simultaneously as practical. This is often the
case in prescribing insulin. Two basic types of insulin are
most frequently prescribed: regular, a fast-acting Variety, and
NPH, an intermediate-acting variety. Additionally, a longer-acting
type of insulin called ultralente is also available.
These types of insulin differ in their onset and duration of
action. Regular insulin typically has the quickest onset and
the briefest duration of action. The onset and duration of
insulin may be modified by chemical manipulations which include
precipitation with protamine or suspension with isophane or
zinc. Injectable insulin is derived from pigs and cattle, and
a semi-synthetic genetically-engineered human form is available
commercially.Regardless of the final chemical composition or
origin of the insulin prescribed, the physician frequently
advises the patient to mix two or more types of insulin and to
inject them at least once a day. Some patients respond best to
a schedule of two or three daily doses, usually in conjunction
with meals. Frequently trial-and-error type of evaluation is
practiced to arrive at the correct dosing and combination for
the individual patient. However, after this initial adjustment
period, the patient may be maintained on the same dose and
proportion of insulins for many weeks or months assuming that
the patient's diet, activity, and state of health remain
reasonably constant or predictable. An example of a typical
mixture and ratio of insulins is 70% NPH and 30% regular
insulin injected just prior to a meal.The implications of insulin therapy for the patient
generally include the need for two separate sets of insulin 
injection syringes and needles. This is because the patient
will usually draw a predetermined amount of insulin from each
of two vials. A sophisticated patient may be able to use a
single syringe and simply draw up the correct amount from each
separate insulin vial. However, he may prefer to use two
separate needles because of the danger of mixing two types of
insulin by using a needle "contaminated" with one type of
insulin and accidentally getting some of the first insulin into
the second vial from which he draws the second insulin. If the
patient is not sophisticated or not adept at drawing up insulin
from a vial into a syringe, he would need two needles and two
syringes. He may find that he has drawn up too much insulin
and then he wishes to

26A, 27, 27A) and first and second movable elements (46, 46b) by

forced through said first and second exits as the first and

positions towards first and second ending positions;
first and second drive stems (36b,c; 37b) drivingly
coupled to the first and second movable elements;
a reciprocal drive assembly (10) configured to drive
the first and second movable elements (46, 46b) from the first

positions, the reciprocal drive assembly including:


first and second reciprocating drivers (140b,c;
302), including one-way drive elements (326), said one-way

drive elements being configured to drivingly engage the
first and second drive stems when the first and second

reciprocating drivers are moved toward the first and second
ending positions, the one-way drive elements configured to

be drivingly disengaged from the first and second drive
stems so that the first and second drive stems do not move

when the first and second reciprocating drivers are moved
away from the first and second ending positions; and
first and second dose adjusters (60b, 61b) for
adjusting the relative distances the first and second

reciprocating drivers (140b,c; 302) and the first and second
drive stems (36b,c; 37b,c) associated therewith travel

during each cycle of the reciprocal driver so the amounts
and proportions of the contents of the first and second

containers (6, 6b, 7) forced through the first and second
exits during each of one or more cycles of the reciprocal

drive assembly can be selected by the user while said 
amounts and proportions remain the same unless said

relative distances are changed,
wherein the first and second drive stems
(36b, c; 37b, c) include axially extending drive

surfaces (233);
said drive surfaces (233) and said
reciprocating drivers (140b, c) are adapted to permit a

range of said relative distances to be chosen by the
user through adjustment of said dose adjusters (60b,

61b);
