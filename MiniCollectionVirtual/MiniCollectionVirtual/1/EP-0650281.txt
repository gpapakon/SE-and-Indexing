<ABSTRACT>
The relative amounts of additive white noise and proportional noise in a 
communication channel (24) are compensated for by providing adaptive precoding 

and preemphasis to signal point signals. The amounts of precoding and preemphasis 
are controlled using scalars to modify the magnitudes of the precoding and 

preemphasis signals that are combined with the signal point signals. The values of 
the scalars are transferred between the transmitter and receiver, and the values can be 

changed without losing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to encoding data for transfer over a 
communication channel; more specifically, communicating data over a telephone 
communication channel which is susceptible to inter-symbol interference. Communication channels suffer from additive white noise and 
proportional noise. Additive white noise equally effects both small and large 
amplitude signals, and proportional noise more strongly effects larger amplitude 
signals. Precoding is used to combat additive white noise and preemphasis is 
used to combat proportional noise. Some prior communication systems use 
precoding or preemphasis. Two precoding systems that do not provide preemphasis are disclosed in 
U.S. Patent 5,162,812 and in a paper disclosed to the Telecommunications Industry 
Association (TIA). U.S. Patent 5,162,812, entitled "Technique for Achieving the full 
Coding Gain of Encoded Digital Signals", discloses a precoding system in which a 
transmitted signal is encoded using a trellis code and precoded using a generalized 
partial response filter. FIG. 1 illustrates the transmitter disclosed in the 
aforementioned U.S. Patent. Serial-to-parallel converter 10 converts the incoming 
data to parallel words. Trellis encoder 12 encodes the parallel word to provide 
increased immunity to inter-symbol interference. Symbol mapper 14 maps the trellis 
encoded word to a signal point in a predefined symbol or signal point constellation. 
The symbol specified by symbol mapper 14 is in the form of a complex number 
which is received by precoding unit 16. Precoding unit 16 is used to compensate for 
signal distortions that are introduced at a receiver when the receiver passes the 
symbol through a noise whitening filter. Received symbols are passed through a 
noise whitening filter to compensate for the communication channel's colored noise 
and thereby improve proper decoding of the trellis code. Precoder 16 includes 
transversal filter 18 and non-linear filter 20. Non-linear filter 20 is in the form of a 
modulo device that repeatedly subtracts or adds a value of 2L from its input until its 
output α satisfies -L≦α≦L. Non-linear filter 20 is used to compensate for any 
instability introduced by filter 18. The output of precoder 16 is modulated by 
modulator 19 using a modulation technique such as QAM (quadrature amplitude  
 
modulation). The output of modulator 19 is filtered by filter 21, passed through 
hybrid 22, and then out to local telephone loop 24. A similar precoding system is disclosed in a paper presented to 
Technical

of said precoding signal, said first scalar having a first value communicated to a 

receiver; 
   generating a preemphasis signal using a second scalar to control a 

magnitude of said preemphasis signal, said second scalar having a second value 
communicated to the receiver; 

   forming a modified signal point signal using said signal point signal,
