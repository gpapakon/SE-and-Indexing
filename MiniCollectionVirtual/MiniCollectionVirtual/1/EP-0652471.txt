material is disclosed. The method comprises the 

steps of (1) forming silver halide crystal nuclei, (2) growing 
the nuclei to form a silver halide emulsion, (3) chemically 

sensitizing the silver halide emulsion with a selenium 
compound, and (4) coating and drying the silver halide 

emulsion on a support, and a compound represented by formula I 
is added to the silver halide emulsion during the time between 

the moment of completion of the nuclei forming step and the 
moment of completion of the chemically sensitizing step. 


In the formula R₁ is a hydrogen atom, a straight or branched 
alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an alkenyl group, an aralkyl 

group, an alkoxyl group, an aryl group, a heterocyclic group, 
a carbamoyl group, a thiocarbamoyl group or a sulfamoyl group;

atom, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, a 

cyano group, an alkylthio group, an arylthio group, 
alkylsulfoxido group, an alkylsulfonyl group or a heterocyclic 

group, and the groups each represented by R₂ and R₃ may be 
combined with each other to form a benzene ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing
a silver halide photographic light-sensitive material, and
more particularly to a method for manufacturing a silver halide
photographic light-sensitive material that is improved so as
not to fog when handled in a safelight, said improvement being
carried out without lowering the sensitivity thereof.In recent years, there have been more and more diverse
demands on silver halide photographic light-sensitive materials.
Particularly in the field of X-ray photography, there
has been a demand for a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material that is high-speed, high-quality-image-formable
and rapidly processable enough to reduce the X-ray exposure
dose to the human body so as to enable to rapidly obtain much 
more plenty of diagnostic information with a smaller amount of
X-ray dose than ever before.As for raising the photographic speed of the light-sensitive
material, Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public
Inspection (hereinafter abbreviated to JP O.P.I.) Nos. 25832/1992
and 147250/1992 disclose lately a chemical sensitization
technique that uses selenium compounds.The above technique certainly achieves raising the photographic
speed, but has a problem of increasing a safelight fog
that could occur when handling the light-sensitive material in
a safelight.The safelight for silver halide light-sensitive material
is commonly made so as to pass a spectral region of light to
which a light-sensitive material to be handled under it is
substantially not sensitive. However, some fog is formed when
the light-sensitive material is stood under the safelight for
a prolonged time, which is called safelight fog by those skilled
in the art. It is known that the safelight fogging degree
of a light-sensitive material is considerably varied depending
on various factors of the manufacturing condition of the light-sensitive
material even though the speed and spectral sensitivity
of the light-sensitive material seem not to be changed.
Of course, a light-sensitive material which forms little or no
safelight fog is required.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
method for producing a silver halide photographic light-sensitive
material whose improvement for decreasing its safelight
fog is attained without impairing its high sensitivity.The method of the invention comprises the steps of (1)
forming silver halide crystal nuclei, (2) growing said nuclei
to form silver halide grains, (3) chemically sensitizing said
silver halide grains with a
