<ABSTRACT>
A control method and system when a flash memory is used 
as a semiconductor disk or a main memory in an information 

processing system. A semiconductor file system comprises a first 
nonvolatile memory electrically erasable, a second nonvolatile 

memory not electrically erasable, a volatile memory, a controller 
which controls the memories, and a control section which controls 

the controller wherein a physical address corresponding to a 
logical address specified from an external system is accessed. The 

first nonvolatile memory stores data for the external system to 
perform operations, first management information indicating the 

correspondence between physical addresses at which the data is 
stored and logical addresses, and second management information 

indicating a state of the first nonvolatile memory. The second 
nonvolatile memory previously stores interface information 

required for inputting and outputting the data from and to the 
external system and read-only data of the data. The controller 

comprises control means for determining a physical sector address 
forming predetermined high-order bits of the physical address 

when data is output from the first nonvolatile memory or when 
data is input to the volatile memory, means for storing the 

determined physical sector address, and means for consecutively 
generating addresses in a sector determined by the physical sector 

address. The control section is responsive to the interface 
information, the first management information, and the second  

 
management information for controlling input/output of data 

from/to the external system and for temporarily storing write 
data into the first nonvolatile memory from the external system in 

the volatile memory and then transferring the write data from the 
volatile memory to the first nonvolatile memory. The consecutive 

address generation means and the sector address storage means 
output the physical sector address and the consecutively 

generated addresses to the first nonvolatile memory and the 
volatile memory when data at the physical sector address is 

output from the first nonvolatile memory or when data at the 
physical sector address is input to the volatile memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
an information processing system according to claims 1, and 10
respectively.A flash memory is available as one of the memories used
with small information devices, machines, etc. The flash memory
has the following four advantages as a promising memory
replacing a hard disk:
1. Data is retained if power is turned off (data in DRAM is
lost when power is turned off).2. Fast data read compared with hard disk.3. Semiconductor device, which has good resistance to
vibration compared with hard disk.4. Less expensive compared with SRAM.However, the flash memory has the following disadvantages:
1. When data is written, the write area contents must have
been erased.2. Erasure is made in chip units or block units of a given size. 3. It takes time for a write for reasons 1 and 2.4. Since elements are degraded by repeating a write, the
write count is limited.Figure 97 is a schematic diagram of a flash memory
- containing 1024 blocks each consisting of 512 bytes (524288
bytes in total). In Figure 97, numeral 4110 denotes one block in
the flash memory and numeral 4111 denotes a I-byte data
retention section in the block 4110, which will be hereinafter
referred to as a cell. Numeral 4105 is a control circuit. When a
read access is made to the flash memory, data is read from the cell
determined by address signal A0-A8, a buffer 4121, and a
decoder 4122 in the block determined by address signal A9-A18,
a buffer 4131, and a decoder 4132, and is output via a register
4141 to I/O0-I/O7. Numeral 4123 is a control signal of the buffer
4121 and the decoder 4122. Numeral 4133 is a control signal of
the buffer 4131 and the decoder 4132. Numeral 4142 is a control
signal of the register 4141. On the other hand, when a write
access is made to the flash memory in Figure 97, the contents of
the block determined by the address signal A9-A18, the buffer
4131, and the decoder 4132 are erased and input data from I/O0-I/O7
is written via the register 4141 into the cell determined by
the address signal A0-A8, the buffer 4121, and the decoder 4122.
Numeral 401 is a control signal of the controller 4105.The limit of the write count mentioned above will introduce
a serious problem with the use of the flash memory as storage
media of a semiconductor disk. For example, data is written into 
areas such as a directory and FAT (file allocation table) on a disk
more, frequently than other areas, that is, data is frequently
written into only specific blocks of the flash memory allocated to
the directory and FAT and there is
