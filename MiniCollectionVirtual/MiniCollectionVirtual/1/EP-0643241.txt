screw and a plurality of ball bearings wherein said ball 

nut has a metallic sleeve segment (40) including a longitudinal 
opening (42) and a plurality of equidistant arcuate 

grooves (46). A polymeric deflector segment (30) is included,

apart sufficiently to cooperate with the plurality of 
arcuate grooves (46) of the sleeve segment for completing a 

plurality of bearing race circuits inside the ball nut.

including a longitudinal slot (28) for receiving the deflector 
segment (14) sufficiently to place the plurality of equal 

distant arcuate grooves (46) into cooperation relationship

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ball screw assemblies 
for translating rotary motion to linear motion or 
vice-versa and, more particularly, to a light-weight 
ball nut manufactured from a polymeric material including 
a metallic inner sleeve and a method of making same. Ball screw assemblies are commonly utilized to 
translate rotary motion to linear motion or vice-versa. 
Most ball screw assemblies include an elongate ball 
screw, and a ball nut body. The ball nut body in 
cooperation with the ball screw direct a plurality of 
ball bearings through an internal bearing race formed 
between the ball nut body and ball screw upon rotation 
of the ball screw. The ball bearings translate rotary 
motion of the ball screw to linear motion of the ball 
nut body. Both the elongate ball screw and ball nut 
body commonly include a continuous helical groove which 
defines the internal bearing race. As is known in the prior art, continuous 
contact between the ball bearings and that portion of 
the ball screw forming the bearing race causes significant 
wear of those parts over time. It is known that 
the components comprising the bearing race thus must be 
made from materials that have strength values capable of 
handling high stresses. Definitive relationships must  
 
be maintained between the helical grooves that recirculate 
the balls through the ball nut body. These relationships 
are maintained through precision machining and 
forming operations applicable to the particular high 
strength material chosen. The materials commonly used 
in the prior art for manufacturing these components 
include various metals, typically steel. Entire ball nut bodies are commonly manufactured 
from steel and grooves are machined within the 
ball nut body. Similarly, the elongate ball screw is 
commonly manufactured from steel including matching 
helical grooves. The best known methods of manufacturing 
steel nut bodies incorporating an internal helical 
groove result in relatively heavy ball nut bodies which 
are expensive to manufacture. These single piece or 
unitary ball nut bodies are normally produced by mechanical 
chip-forming machining starting from a block of 
steel. In continuously recirculating ball nut assemblies, 
either an inner or separate outer ball return or 
recirculation system must be included to allow the balls 
to translate properly. Manufacturing processes for 
forming these recirculation devices on steel nut bodies 
are generally very expensive. The use of steel ball nut 
assemblies of the single piece type
