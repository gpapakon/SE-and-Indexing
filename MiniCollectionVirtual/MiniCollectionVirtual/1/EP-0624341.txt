<ABSTRACT>
A home trainer, in particular in the form of a stationary cycle (bicycle, bike) is provided with a microprocessor and a device for measuring the performance (output) of the person training, as well as with a sensor for detecting the physical condition as a function of time during training and after training. In order to achieve an enhanced pyschological stimulation to use the trainer even over lengthy periods, it is provided that use is made of sensors (15) for measuring the volume resistance of the surface of the skin, which are connected to a microprocessor ( mu C). For its part, the microprocessor ( mu C) controls acoustic and/or optical display (indicating) devices (indicators) (17 and 18, respectively) as a function of the signal received from the sensors (15).

A home trainer, in particular in the form of a stationary bicycle, a microprocessor
and a device for collecting the performance of a person exercising

as well as a sensor for measuring the electric resistance of the skin surface
being provided on the home trainer, which sensor is connected with a

microprocessor, the microprocessor triggering acoustic and/or optical indicator
instruments in dependence on the signal received from the sensor,


characterized in that
 an acoustic indicator instrument comprises a synthesizer
(17) generating a melody which slows down and/or gets deeper in

pitch in dependence on the subsiding of the state of excitement detected by
the sensors (15).
A home trainer, in particular according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a
cassette recorder or a reproducer, respectively, of compact disks or mini

disks is provided, a training program being stored on the respective storage
medium such that the person exercising gets spoken instructions on the behavior

for exercising.
A home trainer according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the microprocessor
(ÂµC) is connected with the cassette recorder (18) or the like such

that the microprocessor selects a suitable stored training program in dependence
on the training condition of the person exercising, for instance in

accordance with the fitness characteristics stored from the latest exercise.
A home trainer according to claim 2, 
characterized by
 an interrupt circuit
arrangement for interrupting the training instructions from the cassette recorder

or the reproducer whenever the microprocessor detects that limits of 
the pulse rate, of the distance covered theoretically, of the theoretical velocity

of driving etc. are exceeded.
A home trainer according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 at least one reference
key for calling the training characteristics stored from the latest training

cycle and for comparison with the stored characteristics of the training
cycle actually performed.
