<ABSTRACT>
For the generation of hot gases, for example in a firing system, a premix burner (X) is used which essentially consists of at least two hollow sectional bodies (1, 2) which are positioned one on top of the other and the centre axes (1b, 2b) of which run offset from one another in the longitudinal direction of the sectional bodies (1, 2). This offset in each case results in tangential inlet slots (21, 22) through which a combustion air flow (15) passes into the interior space (14) of the premix burner (X). Arranged in the area of these tangential inlet slots (21, 22) are venturi mixers (32) with fuel nozzles (36) through which a fuel (31) is injected into the combustion air (15) flowing past there.

Method of operating a premixing burner, which 
consists essentially of at least two hollow partial 

bodies, which are positioned one upon the other and 
whose centre line [sic]
 extend offset relative to one 
another in the longitudinal direction of the partial 

bodies, such that by this means an axial inlet flow 
cross-section and tangential inlet slots respectively 

occur for the supply of a combustion airflow into the 
internal space of the premixing burner, the premixing 

burner being operated by means of at least one fuel 
supply, characterized in that the fuel supply (36, 46) 

takes place in the region of at least one venturi 
section (33, 34, 45) which acts above the internal 

space (14) of the premixing burner (X), and in that the 
combustion airflow (15) flows through this venturi section 

(33, 34, 45). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the premixing burner (X) is operated with a fuel 

(31) of high hydrogen content. 
Premixing burner for carrying out the method 
according to Claim 1, the premixing burner (X) 

consisting, in the flow direction, of at least two 
hollow partial bodies (1, 2) which are positioned one 

upon the other and whose centre lines (1b, 2b) extend 
offset relative to one another in the longitudinal 

direction of the partial bodies (1, 2) in such a way 
that tangential inlet slots (21, 22) and an axial inlet 

flow cross-section (18) occur, characterized in that at 
least one venturi mixer (32, 44) is arranged in the 

region of the tangential inlet slots (21, 22) and in 
that at least one fuel nozzle (36, 46) is in effective 

connection with the venturi mixer (32, 44). 
Premixing burner according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the premixing burner (X) is 

provided with at least one fuel nozzle (3) placed at 
the head end and/or with a number of fuel nozzles (17) 

arranged in the region of the tangential inlet slots 
(21, 22).  

 
Premixing burner according to Claims 3 and 4, 
characterized in that a gaseous fuel (31) can be 

introduced through the fuel nozzle (36, 46) in the 
region of the venturi mixer (32, 44), a liquid fuel 

(12) can be introduced through the fuel nozzle (3) 
arranged at the head end and a gaseous fuel (13) can be 

introduced through the fuel nozzles (17) arranged in 
the region of the tangential inlet slots (21, 22). 
Premixing burner according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the partial bodies (1, 2) have a 

uniformly increasing flow cross-section in the flow 
direction. 
Premixing burner according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the partial bodies (1, 2) have a 

non-uniformly increasing flow cross-section in the flow 
direction. 
Premixing burner according to Claim 3, 

characterized in that the partial bodies (1, 2) have a 
uniformly decreasing flow cross-section in the flow 

direction. 
Premixing burner according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the partial bodies (1, 2) have a 

non-uniformly decreasing flow cross-section in the flow 
direction.
