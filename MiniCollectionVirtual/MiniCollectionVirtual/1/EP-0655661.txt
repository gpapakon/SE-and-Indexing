<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus includes an image 
carrier, a developer (8) for developing an electrostatic 

latent image on the image carrier, a transfer device 
for transferring the developed image on the image 

carrier onto a transfer medium (P), a feed device for 
feeding the transfer medium to a transfer portion by 

the transfer device, and an optical element (15,16) for 
optically detecting the amount of developing agent (T) in 

the developer (8). The optical element is arranged at a 
side opposite to the developer (8) with respect to the 

convey path of the transfer medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus such as a copying machine, a printer, a
facsimile apparatus, or the like and, more
particularly, to an image forming apparatus which
optically detects the remaining amount of a developing
agent.As a conventional developing agent
presence/absence detection device in an
electrophotography apparatus or the like, a
light-transmitting type developing agent
presence/absence detection device, in which a
photointerrupter is formed by arranging a light source
and a light-receiving element to oppose each other, and
which detects the presence/absence of a developing
agent therebetween, is known (Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application No. 63-2087).Fig. 11 is a sectional view showing principal part
of an example of a light-transmitting type device for
detecting the presence/absence of a developing agent.
In Fig. 11, the device includes a light-emitting
element 101, a light-receiving element 102, and a 
developing agent container 103, which has windows 104
and 105 for passing light at positions opposing the
light-emitting element 101 and the light-receiving
element 102.In this device, while the developing agent
container 103 stores a sufficient amount of developing
agent D, light emitted from the light-emitting element
101 and entering the developing agent container 103 via
the window 104 is interrupted by the developing agent
D, and does not reach the light-receiving element 102.
On the other hand, when the developing agent container
103 becomes empty upon consumption of the developing
agent, light emitted from the light-emitting element
101 passes through the windows 104 and 105, and reaches
the light-receiving element 102. In this manner, the
presence/absence of the developing agent D is detected
based on a change in output from the light-receiving
element 102.A window cleaning member 106 is pivoted by a
driving source (not shown) about a rotational shaft 107
as the center of rotation. A cleaning sheet 108
consists of a flexible member, and contacts the inner
surface of the window 104 or 105 upon pivotal motion of
the window cleaning member 106 to wipe out the
developing agent D which becomes attached to the inner
surface of the window 104 or 105. Thus, the presence
of the developing agent can be prevented from being 
erroneously detected due to the developing agent D
which becomes attached to the windows and shields light
emitted from the light-emitting element 101 although
the developing agent container 103 is empty.In such a light-transmitting type
