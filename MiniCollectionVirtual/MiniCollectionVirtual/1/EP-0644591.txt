<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a structure which enables a 
junction leak current to be reduced without reducing a 

capacitor area. A trench (22) is formed in the surface 
of a substrate such that it is connected to a conductive 

region (18) for a transistor. The structure is characterized 
by comprising a capacitor electrode (5) formed 

on the inner peripheral surface of the trench (22) and 
having its upper edge portion located below the conductive 

region (18), an insulating layer (9) projecting 
inward of the trench at least from the upper edge portion 

of the capacitor electrode (5) to the conductive 
region (18), thereby narrowing the diameter of the 

trench, a capacitor insulating film (10) coated on the 
capacitor electrode (5), and a capacitor electrode (11) 

filling the trench and contacting the capacitor insulating 
film (10). 

The insulating layer (9) can be produced by selectively oxidizing part 
of a polysilicon layer (5) or part of the sustrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device,
more particularly to a trench capacitor structure of a
DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), and also to a
method for manufacturing the structure.An example of a DRAM having a sheath-plate type
trench capacitor is known from "Half-Vcc Sheath-Plate
Capacitor DRAM Cell with Self-Aligned Buried Plate
Wiring" published in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON
DEVICES, VOL. 35, NO. 8, August 1988, and written by

Reference is also made to EP-A-0 287 056,
JP-A-2 009 166 and EP-A-0 234 891.FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view, showing a
conventional sheath-plate type trench capacitor. As is
shown in FIG. 1, a trench is formed in a semiconductor
substrate 21 in contact with a field oxide film 1. An
area which includes a trench inner wall oxide film 4, a
silicon oxide/silicon nitride (SiO2/SiN) film 10, a
polysilicon film 14, a diffusion layer 16 and part of
the substrate 21 serves as a gate control diode. When a
potential has been applied to the polysilicon film 14
(or to a polysilicon film 11 formed in a deep portion of
the trench), a depletion layer grows in the vicinity of
a peripheral portion of the trench inner wall oxide
film 4, thereby forming an inversion layer such that it
extends from the diffusion layer 16 along the outer 
periphery of the trench. As a result, the amount of a
junction leak current between the substrate 21 and the
diffusion layer 16 contacting the polysilicon film 14
increases.To reduce the influence of the potential applied to
the polysilicon films 11 and 14, it is necessary to make
the oxide film 4 thick. However, increasing the thickness
of the oxide film 4 inevitably reduces the area of
a capacitor insulating film and hence the capacitance of
the trench capacitor.In the conventional structure, the potential applied
to the polysilicon film filled in the trench increases
the junction leak current between the substrate and the
diffusion layer contacting the polysilicon film. To
avoid this, it is necessary to reduce the capacitance of
the capacitor to some extent. Actually, however, the
capacitance is excessively reduced since an increase in
junction leak current is prevented by increasing the
thickness of the trench inner wall oxide film.It is the object of the invention to provide a method of
manufacturing a highly reliable semiconductor device having a sufficient
trench capacitor capacitance and a small
