<ABSTRACT>
The measuring device for monitoring buildings, areas of grounds or the like consists of an optical fibre bending sensor which has a multimode optical fibre (GI) and is arranged in the form of a loop. A plurality of arcuate sensor segments (S) are arranged between support plates which are permanently connected to areas of buildings or grounds such that they can move with respect to the sensor segments. A light source and an opto receiver having evaluation devices for light attenuation values are connected to the optical fibre bending sensor. The optical fibre bending sensor is arranged in the form of a plurality of loops. The optical fibre bending sensor consists of graded-index multimode optical fibre segments (GI) and of step-index multimode optical fibre segments (SI) connected thereto. The sensor segments (S) are formed by gradient-index multimode optical fibres (GI).

of land or the like, 


comprising an optical waveguide bending sensor, which 
has a multi-mode optical waveguide (GI) and is arranged 

in the form of a loop, 
having a plurality of arcuate sensor sections (S) 
between support plates (2, 3), which are securely 

connected with respect to the sensor sections (S) and 
to areas of buildings or land, and 
comprising a light source connected to the optical 
waveguide bending sensor and light receivers with 

evaluation means for light attenuation values,

is guided by deflection means (11) with an outer 
surface which has a bending radius and the deflection 

means are connected to the ends (6, 7) of the support 
plates (2, 3) which face each other.  

 
A measuring device according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that each support plate (2, 3) has a 

receiving space (17, 21) for the optical waveguide (15) 
with input means (16, 20) and output means (27), the 

optical waveguide lying against the inner wall of the 
receiving space.
