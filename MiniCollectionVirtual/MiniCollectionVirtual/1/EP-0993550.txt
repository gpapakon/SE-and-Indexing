Fuel-drawing device for a motor vehicle tank, of
the type comprising a housing (100) which bears a

withdrawing pump (190) and a filter (180) arranged on
the outlet pipe of the pump (190), the filter (180)

having an annular shape and being arranged in a chamber
radially external to the housing (100), the pump being

arranged in the central space of the filter (180), and
the device has a jet pump (150) designed to fill a

reserve bowl (130) associated with the pump (190),

characterized in that
 the pump (190) is associated with
a vibration damper (196) arranged in the central space

of the filter (180) and 
in that
 the housing (100) has a
nozzle (129) moulded integrally on the lower wall of

the housing and which connects the inlet chamber of the
filter (180) and the jet nozzle (152) of the jet pump

(150).
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the housing (100) housing the filter (180) is formed of
a body (120) surmounted by a cover (110).
Device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that

the reserve bowl (130) is fixed to the base of the body
(120).
Device according to either of Claims 2 and 3,

characterized in that
 the body (120) and the cover 
(110) each have an outwardly projecting flange (122,

124; 112, 114) running around their opening, either on
their radially external surface or on their radially

internal surface, these flanges being connected
together in pairs to seal the internal chamber defined

by the body (120) and the cover (110).
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 4,


characterized in that
 the cover (110) and the body
(120) are connected together by vibration welding.
Device according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that

one of the cover (110) and the body (120) is equipped
with an annular groove (116) with an annular rib (118)

at its centre, while the other of the body (120) and
the cover (110) is equipped with an annular rib (128)

which complements the first rib (118), the tops of the
ribs (118, 128) being connected by vibration welding.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the filter (180) comprises a
radial-flow filter element (182) placed between an

upper end plate (184) and a lower end plate (186).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 it comprises means (160, 162) for
grounding the metallic end plates (184, 186) of the

filter (180).
Device according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that

the grounding means are formed of an electrically
conducting stud (160) which passes in leaktight fashion

through the upper wall of the housing (100) and which
is electrically connected to an elastic leaf (162),

which is also electrically conducting, which rests
elastically on an end plate (184) of the housing.
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 6,

characterized in that
 the region of connection between 
the cover (110) and the body (120) is located

approximately mid-way up the housing (100).
Device according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that

sealing is achieved between the reserve bowl (130) and
the housing (100).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 11,

characterized in that
 a nonreturn valve (500) is placed
on an inlet nozzle (222) incorporated into the base

(200) of the device that is intended to be fixed to a
wall of the tank.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 12,

characterized in that
 the base (200) intended to be
fixed to a wall of the tank comprises two integrally-moulded

coaxial pipes (220, 204) and a ball (206)
driven into one wall to provide the demarcation between

these two pipes, so as to seal one of them from the
other.
Device according to Claim 13, 
characterized in
that
 one (204) of the two coaxial pipes provides a
connection between the outlet of a regulator (240) and

a pipe (250) returning to the reserve bowl, and the
other (220) of the two coaxial pipes acts as an outlet

to the site where the fuel will be used.
Motor vehicle fuel tank 
characterized in that
 it
comprises a drawing device according to one of Claims 1

to 14.
