<ABSTRACT>
A push-chair consists of two delta-shaped side frames (12 and 13) connected by cross bars such as (14), with a seat (11) attached between the side frames, and with wheels (15, 16, 17, etc.) at the bottom ends of the side frame bars (26, 28). A transverse platform (35) is provided at its lower rear, with the rear wheels (16) mounted substantially at the trailing edge of the platform. The seat (11) is forward of the platform, so that a second child can be carried on the platform, in a standing position behind the seat (11). Alternatively, a shopping bag (39) can be carried vertically on the platform.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to perambulators or
push-chairs, primarily of the modern type also known as
baby buggies.The standard push-chair of the baby buggy type
consists of framework on which a seat is suspended,
the framework consisting of a pair of side frames of
delta shape stabilized and held together by cross-bars
and with two small diameter wheels at the lower corners
of each side frame. The side frames are normally
hinged so that the framework can be folded relatively
flat, and may have one or more arms extended (eg to
provide a push-bar or handle at a convenient height).
The seat may be formed of canvas or similar material or
may be a moulding of plastics material, having a roughly
rectangular base, a roughly rectangular back, and two
roughly triangular sides.There are of course many developments of and variations
on this basic design. For example, the cross-bars
may be hinged to allow the chair to be folded more
compactly; there may be a hood or cover; the seat suspension
may be adjustable to allow the seat to be
mounted in forward, reverse, and/or flat positions; a tray
may be provided beneath the seat, to carry shopping;
and various braking arrangements may be provided;
and various locking arrangements may be provided to
minimize the risk of collapse when the chair is unfolded
and in use.Also, each of the two front wheels may actually be a
pair of wheel discs mounted one on each side of a vertical
shaft which is pivotally mounted on the side frame,
to allow easier steering of the chair, and similarly each
of the two rear wheels may actually be a pair of wheel
discs mounted one on each side of a vertical shaft
(though for the rear wheels, the vertical shaft may not be
pivoted).The chair may also be a multiple chair. It may have
2 seats mounted one behind the other between the two
side frames (the rear seat usually being higher than the
front one);alternatively, it may have 2 (or even more)
seats side by side (such chairs usually have a frame,
matching the side frames, between each adjacent pair
of seats).The push-chair as described so far is intended to
carry a single child. Occasionally, however, there is a
need to carry two children. This can be done in various
ways.KÃ¶niger (DE U 91 09 676) describes a conventional
perambulator (pram) of the coach-built type (having a
boat-like gondola in which a small child lies flat), and
proposes clipping a platform, for example in the form of
a wooden plank, to the two axles of the wheels so that
its rear end extends approximately to level with the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A push-chair having seat mounting means (18) for mounting a seat or seats (11) and
with auxiliary child carrying means therebehind, 
characterized in that
 the auxiliary child
carrying means comprise a platform (35) located at the lower rear of the push-chair between

the rear wheels and having a substantially unobstructed trailing edge adjacent to or
forward of the axis of the rear wheels, the rear

wheels (16) of the push-chair being fixedly mounted adjacent to the trailing edge of the platform with the seat
mounting means (18) forward of the platform to provide a substantially unobstructed space

above the platform, whereby a child can step onto and off the platform and safely stand on
the platform.
A push-chair according to daim 1 
characterized in
that
 it comprises a pair of delta-shaped side frames
(12, 13) with the rear sloping bars (28) having the

platform (35) mounted on their lower ends.
A push-chair according to claim 2 
characterized in
that
 the seat mounting means (18) are carried on
forward projections of the horizontal bars (29') of

the side frames beyond the front bars (26') and on
auxiliary bars (32) forwardly mounted on the upper

portions of the front bars (25').
A push-chair according to either of claims 2 and 3

characterized in that
 the platform (35) is mounted
rigidly on the rear sloping bars (28).
A push-chair according to either of claims 2 and 3

characterized in that
 the platform (35) is spring-mounted
(48, Fig. 2) on the rear sloping bars (28).
A push-chair according to any previous claim
wherein the rear wheels (16) have lever-operated

braking mechanisms (49, 49") coupled together,

characterized in that
 the braking mechanisms are
coupled together by a brake coupling rod rotatably

mounted in pivot mountings (51) and located forward
of the axles of the rear wheels (16, 16') and

below the level of the platform (35).
