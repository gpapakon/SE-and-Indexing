<ABSTRACT>
An electronic protection device to counter 
excessive car battery discharge is described, 

comprising a relay (Y) which can be controlled by a 
first transistor (TR2) . One relay contact (X') positioned 

between the battery (B) and the feed node (N) for several 
loads (1-7) which can be controlled by said device. The 

parallel to the contact a second transistor (TR¹) is 
connected which can be controlled by a third 

transistor (TR3) actuated in its turn in correlation to 
a certain output level from a comparator (A1). This 

compares the voltage generated by a resistance 
divider (R1,R2), proportional to the battery voltage (VB), 

with a reference voltage (VREF). The upstream and 
downstream voltages of the second transistor can 

be registered by means of the respective dividers (R6,R7,R8,R9) 
which generate voltage signals which are (V⁴B,V'N) which are 

directly proportional to said voltage levels of the second 
transistor (TR1) and which can be compared by means of 

a second comparator (A2). This comparator (A2) is provided 
for the command of a second transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
Considering the electrical components on a 
current motor vehicle, it can be stated that they 
fall into two categories. The first consists of 
all the components controlled directly or 
indirectly by the ignition key and characterized 
in that there is no power demand on the on board 
battery if the key is not inserted, assuming that 
there is no breakdown in the system. The second includes the components which 
require a direct power feed from the battery, for 
example the remote control with its corresponding 
door locking/unlocking system, electrically 
slidable seats (with or without data storage), 
parking lights, internal roof lights, glove 
compartment and boot lights, boot and tank cap 
locking/unlocking device, electric clock, car 
radio, antitheft system, the RAM electronic 
system and the hazard lights. The above mentioned components are generally 
characterized in that they consume momentary or 
short-lived currents, even of high voltage 
levels, for the activation of servo-systems, for 
example door locking/unlocking, while they 
continually consume low voltage currents of a few  
 
milliamperes, or at maximum tens of milliamperes, 
while in stand-by. Therefore, individually every 
component has a negligible effect on battery 
discharge, but when there are many of them and 
the vehicle is stationary for a long time (weeks 
or months), then they can cause battery 
discharge; this is essentially due to the 
continuous currents consumed by the above 
mentioned components while in stand-by. The first consequence of excessive discharge, 
which the user discovers immediately, is that the 
engine cannot be started. The second is that the life of the battery is 
reduced dramatically, especially if there are 
repeated and total discharges which require 
the user to replace the battery in a short time 
with all the nuisance and cost involved. Car manufacturers obviously define the maximum 
consumption limits, with the ignition off, for 
standard equipments and devices, with the aim of 
limiting battery discharge whenever the vehicle 
is stationary, however they have no influence 
over other products which the user may choose to 
install, for example the car radio and the 
antitheft system. Then there are conditions which  
 
the user determines of his/her own free will, 
such as keeping, when the ignition is off, the 
parking lights on or keeping the car radio on at 
a high volume; this causes the consumption of a 
few amperes of current, with easily imaginable 
consequences for the battery if this
