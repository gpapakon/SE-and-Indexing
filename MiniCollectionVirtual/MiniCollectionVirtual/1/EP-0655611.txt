<CLAIMS>
Container for accommodating loose material, which
container includes at least one material inlet duct (2) and

has a cover (3) and a tightly closing outlet, the container
having a funnel-shaped configuration in the lower region,

and the outlet (8) being disposed approximately
concentrically relative to the funnel-shaped region, and an

outlet closing member, in the form of a double cone (13),
being axially displaceably disposed in the container

interior, and the double cone (13) sealing and closing the
container directly at the container cone transition to the

outlet (8), and the narrowest region of the container cone
being thus configured as a sealing face.
Container according to claim 1, characterised in
that the loose material, which is contained in the

container, is gravimetrically determinable.
Container according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the angle of inclination of the lower

double cone of the outlet closing member corresponds
approximately to, or is slightly greater than, the angle of

inclination of the funnel-shaped outlet of the container.
Container according to one of the aforementioned
claims, characterised in that the double cone (13) is

displaceable in the interior of the container via a rod
(14).
Container according to claim 4, characterised in
that a pneumatic cylinder (15) moves the rod (14) upwardly

and downwardly.
Container according to one of the aforementioned
claims, characterised in that the position of the shut-off

device is indicated via proximity initiators (16). 
Container according to one of the aforementioned
claims, characterised in that the material inlet ducts (2)

are connected to the material supply apertures (5) via
flexible sleeves (4).
Container according to one of the aforementioned
claims, characterised in that the material supply apertures

(5) are provided with quick-closing shutters (6).
Container according to one of the aforementioned
claims, charact.erised in that a vibrator (7) is mounted on

the container (1).
Container according to one of the aforementioned
claims, characterised in that a flexible sleeve (9),

together with a down pipe (10) situated therebelow or a
collecting vessel, is mounted at the outlet (8) of the

container.
Container according to one of the aforementioned
claims, characterised in that the container (1) is screwed

onto a firmly anchored weighing frame (12), on which one or
more pressure cells (11) are mounted.
