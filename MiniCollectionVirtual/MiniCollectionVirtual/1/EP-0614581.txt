<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oscillators and,
more particularly, to voltage controlled surface acoustic
wave ("SAW") oscillators.As is known in the art, there exists a need in many
radio frequency applications, such as in radar receivers
and transmitters, for highly stable oscillators or other
sources of radio frequency signals. One of the more
general approaches to fulfilling this need is to use a so-called
SAW stabilized oscillator in which a SAW device
such as a delay line or a resonator is disposed within a
feedback loop which has an integral number of 2 pi radians
of phase shift and excess small signal gain at a
particular frequency within the passband frequency of the
SAW stabilizing device.In many of these applications, it is necessary to
have an oscillator the output frequency of which is highly
stable both over long periods of time, as well as over
relatively short periods of time. The first stability
characteristic is generally referred to as the aging
characteristics of the oscillator and is principally
related to long-term variations in the electrical
characteristics of the devices comprising the SAW
stabilized oscillator. More specifically, one of the
major contributors to variations in oscillator performance
over long periods of time may be the SAW device itself.
SAW devices typically have aging rates on the order of
several parts per million per year, although SAW
resonators are now available having aging rates on the
order of a few parts per million per year or less. Thus,
aging is increasingly becoming a negligible cause of
frequency instability in such devices. Another cause of frequency instability is short-term
frequency variations or noise. SAW stabilized oscillators
have relatively poor close-to-carrier phase noise
characteristics. That is, there exists a relatively large
amount of noise power per unit of bandwidth at offset
frequencies close to the carrier or fundamental frequency
of the oscillator. This results principally from inherent
characteristics of the SAW stabilizing element and other
oscillator components such as the loop amplifiers.A concept, besides noise, that plays a major role
with respect to the background of the present invention
is that of jitter, which may be time, amplitude,
frequency, or phase related. Jitter refers to abrupt,
spurious variations in the duration, magnitude, frequency,
or phase of the frequency modulation of an interval,
successive cycles, or successive pulses of a repetitive
wave. Stated more simply, variations in the pulse
positions
