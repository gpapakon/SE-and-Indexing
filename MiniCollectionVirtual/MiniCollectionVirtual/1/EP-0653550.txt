<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a breather device for an internal combustion engine, with a plurality of breather circuits, particularly for an internal combustion engine (1) with two banks (3, 4) of cylinders. The aim of the invention is, by simple means, to make such a device more easily adaptable and connectable to the gas-exchange system between the casing to be ventilated and the intake duct (5) of the internal combustion engine (1). For this purpose, the invention proposes an adapter (17) which, for each breather circuit, has separate, specially adapted passages and calibrated openings which are connected to the intake duct (5) precisely where the exhaust gases to be removed can be best supplied to them during the various engine operating ranges. It is thereby possible to achieve optimum adaptation of the breather system by relatively simple means, the complexity of the engine is reduced and, by the avoidance of a large number of individual conduits, a visually attractive and easily installed structure is achieved.

<CLAIMS>
Breather device for an internal combustion engine, which 
operates with several breather circuits, in particular for 

an internal combustion engine with two banks of cylinders, 
characterised in that in the path of breathing between the 

units from which air is to be extracted (crankcase; fuel 
tank 2) and the intake tract (5) of the engine (1) is 

provided an adapter (17) which on the one hand is connected 
by means of pipes (14, 15, 16, 36) to the units and on the 

other hand is connected to the intake tract (5) by 
vibrationally optimised channels (23, 24, 25, 26) located 

in the adapter (17) as well as by calibrated openings (27, 
29; 31, 32; 34, 35) in such a way that each unit from which 

air is to be extracted in the respective operating 
condition of the engine (1) is connected to the correct 

location of the intake tract (5). 
Breather device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the adapter (17) consists of a flat housing which is 

arranged over the intake tract (5) of the engine (1) and of 
which the interior is divided by webs (42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 

47) extending between the walls into channels (23, 24, 25, 
26) which begin at one end face (18) of the housing and in 

each case lead as far as a target location on the adjacent 
intake tract (5) and there comprise calibrated openings 

(27, 29; 31, 32; 34, 35) which are connected in gasconducting 
relationship to the intake tract (5) by 

connectors (28, 30; 33). 
Breather device according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the housing of the adapter (17) 

consists of two flat shells (38, 39) with their open sides 
resting on each other, with outer edges (40, 41), which in 

their interior comprise webs (42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47) 
extending along the bottom surface, wherein both the outer 

edges (40, 41) of the shells (38, 39) and the webs (42, 43, 
44, 45, 46, 47) of both shells (38, 39) are connected to  

 
each other in gastight relationship and so form the 

channels (23, 24, 25, 26), the shell (39) facing towards 
the intake tract (5) comprises the calibrated openings (27, 

29, 31, 32; 34, 35) and the other shell (38) comprises the 
connection pieces (19, 20, 21, 22) arranged at one end face 

(18) of the adapter (17) and belonging to each channel (23, 
24, 25, 26). 
Breather device according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the peripheral edges (40) and the 

webs (42, 43, 44) on one shell (38) are designed as a 
U-shaped channel, and the peripheral edges (41) and the 

webs (45, 46, 47) of the other shell (39) are designed as 
ribs entering the U-shaped channel, and the edges (40, 41) 

as well as the webs (42, 43, 44; 45, 46, 47) of both shells 
(38, 39) are connected to each other in gastight and non-releasable 

relationship. 
Breather device according to claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that one or more connectors (33) between the 

adapter (17) and the intake tract (5) are designed as 
connection pieces which are rigidly connected to the 

adapter (17) and engage sealingly in openings of the intake 
tract (5). 
Breather device according to claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that one or more connectors (28, 30) are 

designed as sockets which connect connection pieces (27, 
29) located on the adapter (17) to connection pieces on the 

intake tract (5). 
Breather device according to claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the shells (38, 39) forming the 

adapter (17) are made of a thermoplastic material by 
injection moulding. 
Breather device according to claims 1 to 7,  
 

characterised in that the shells (38, 39) forming the 
adapter (17) are connected by friction welding.
