<ABSTRACT>
Dephlegmator system without headers, collectors, or distributors at the bottom
end of feed circuits in plate and fin exchangers operating in condensing or rectifying

service. Each dephlegmator (1,37) is installed within a pressure vessel (3), thereby eliminating the
need for headers, collectors, or distributors at the bottom end of the feed circuits. In an

alternative embodiment of the invention, upper and lower segments of the pressure

vessel (3) are isolated by a mid-vessel seal (207) between the vessel and dephlegmator walls,
and headers or collectors are not required at the upper and lower ends of the feed

circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
Dephlegmators are widely used in the process industries for the separation of gas
mixtures, particularly those which contain components with sub-ambient boiling points.
Such separations require significant amounts of low temperature refrigeration and are
thus highly energy intensive. Dephlegmators offer simple, reliable, and efficient
operation for such gas separations.The characteristic feature of dephlegmator operation is the utilization of
simultaneous heat and mass transfer in a group of generally vertical flow channels or
passageways in indirect heat transfer communication with other flow channels containing
heating or cooling fluids. A dephlegmator thus combines both heat transfer and mass
transfer in a single operating system. Heat and mass transfer in process streams within
dephlegmator channels can occur in either a condensation or vaporization mode.In the condensation or rectification mode of operation, a feed gas mixture is
cooled and partially condensed within a group of flow channels by indirect heat transfer
with one or more refrigerants or colder fluids flowing in adjacent channels. The resulting
condensed liquid flows downward while exchanging heat and mass with the remaining 
vapor, which flows upward. A liquid stream enriched in higher boiling components and a
vapor stream enriched in lower boiling components are withdrawn from the feed flow
channels. Rectification occurs in this operation, and a dephlegmator operating in this
mode is often called a rectifying condenser or rectifying dephlegmator. This type of
dephlegmator can be used for rejecting nitrogen from natural gas (U.S. Patents
4,732,598 and 5,802,871), producing refrigerated liquid methane (U.S. Patent
5,983,665), recovering helium from natural gas (U.S. Patents 5,017,204 and 5,329,775),
purifying synthesis gas (U.S. Patent 4,525,187), recovering C4+ hydrocarbons (U.S.
4,519,825), and for recovering olefins from hydrocarbon-hydrogen mixtures such as
cracked gases, refinery offgases, and petrochemical plant offgases (U.S. Patents
5,361,589, 5,377,490, 5,379,597, and 5,634,354).In the vaporization or stripping mode of operation, a liquid feed mixture is heated
and partially vaporized within a group of flow channels by indirect heat transfer with one
or more warmer fluids flowing in adjacent channels. The vaporizing liquid flows
downward while exchanging heat and mass with the generated vapor, which flows
upward. Stripping action is promoted by the upward flowing vapor. A liquid stream
enriched in higher boiling components and
