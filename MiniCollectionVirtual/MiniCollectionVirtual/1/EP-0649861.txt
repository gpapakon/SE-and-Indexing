<ABSTRACT>
A method for improving the initiation efficiency during the 
anionic polymerization of 15 to 100 percent weight of a vinyl 

aromatic hydrocarbon monomers and 0 to 85 percent by weight of a 
conjugated diene monomer by conducting the polymerization in the 

presence of a catalytically effective amount of: (a) an 
organolithium initiator and (b) a 2,5-substituted tetrahydrofuran 

modifier having the structural formula: 

   wherein R₁ and R₁' are independently H or an alkyl group 
containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R₂ and R₂' are alkyl group 

containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing 
polystyrene and block copolymers from conjugated diene monomers 
and vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon monomers by anionic initiation 
employing an organolithium initiator and employing a 2,5-substituted tetrahydrofuran 
modifier. This modifier improves the initiation efficiency of vinyl aromatic 
hydrocarbon monomers and does not affect the 1,2-microstructure of diene 
contributed units during formation of a block copolymer. Use of modifiers systems in combination with anionic 
initiators in the polymerization of styrene/butadiene copolymers 
is well known. Such modifiers, however, both increase the 1,2-microstructure 
of the diene monomer contributed units of the 
copolymer finally produced and decrease the block styrene 
content. Chelating modifiers including OOPS or TMEDA increase the 
1,2-microstructure of the diene units of the copolymer finally 
produced. Non-chelating tertiary amine modifiers which remain 
with the polymers cause yellowing of the polymers during post 
polymerization processing such as extrusion and injection molding 
processes. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), a well-known non-chelating 
modifier, is known to react with C-Li bonds producing Li 
alkoxide. THF is difficult to remove from hydrocarbon 
polymerization media due to its low boiling point.  
 It is desirable to provide an anionic initiator/modifier 
system for preparing polystyrene having a narrow molecular weight 
distribution and for preparing block copolymers of styrenebutadiene 
having improved initiation rates without having their 
1,2-microstructure affected by the presence of a modifier. It is 
also desirable to discover modifiers that are easily recoverable 
from solvent process streams. The present invention relates to an anionic organolithium initiator 
modifier system and to a method for improving the efficiency of 
anionic organolithium initiators during the preparation of polystyrene and 
-improving the efficiency of the anionic organolithium initiator during the 
preparation of vinyl aromatic hydrocarbon-diene block copolymers 
without affecting the microstructure of the diene contributed 
units. This method is performed by polymerizing a vinyl aromatic 
hydrocarbon monomer and optionally adding up to 85 
percent by weight of a diene monomer in the presence of a 
catalytically effective amount of (a) an organolithium initiator 
and (b) a 2,5-substituted tetrahydrofuran modifier having the 
structural formula:
