<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) for attaching pull tabs (S₉) 
automatically one at a time onto a slider body (S) 

comprises a pull tab transport unit (11), a clamper 
applying unit (12) and a clamping unit (13). The 

transport unit (11) includes a pull tab transfer chute 
(15) having a pair of elongate horizontal guide rails 

(16a, 16b) defining therebetween a guide slit 17 along 
which a series of pull tabs (S₉) are fed for attachment 

one at a time onto sliders (S) transferred along a 
horizontally extending chute (33). A clamper pusher 

(42) is provided for moving a clamper (S₇) of the slider 
(S) pivotally through 90° to lie substantially parallel 

with the guide slit (17) of the pull tab chute (15). A 
transfer conveyor (20) operatively associated with the 

clamper applying unit (12) is movable along a 
rectangular path to move and set the pull tab (S₉) in 

position for connection and clamping with the slider S.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and an
apparatus for attaching a pull tab onto a slider body to
provide a slide fastener slider substatially in an
automated cycle of operation.There have been proposed numerous devices for
attaching pull tabs to associated slider barrels which
are separately fabricated.To the best of the inventors' knowledge, such pull
tab attachment devices known to date were manually
operated as exemplified for instance in Japanese Utility
Model Publication No. 56-37611 which discloses clenching
a pull tab to a ring member on a slider body with use of
a manual clamping tool.Such conventional pull tab attachment operation by
hand was not only literally time-consuming and tedious,
but also would entail difficulty in achieving a uniform
and neat finish of the joint between the pull tab and
the slider body.With the foregoing difficulties of the prior art
in view, the present invention seeks to provide a novel 
method of and an apparatus for attaching a pull tab to
its associated slider body substantially automatically
with utmost efficiency and accuracy.This and other objective and features of the
invention will became apparent from the following
detailed description taken in connection with the
accompanying drawings.According to one aspect of the invention, there is
provided a method of attaching a pull tab onto a slider
body which comprises the steps of;
(a) feeding a series of pull tab intermittently
one at a time along a horizontal path of travel with an
opening in a coupling link of each pull tab oriented to
face upward; (b) feeding a series of unclamped sliders
intermittently one at a time along a separate horizontal
path of travel above the horizontal path of pull tabs,
with a clamper vertically suspended from each slider
body;(c) lifting the clamper pivotally to lie
substantially horizontally parallel with respect to the
horizontal path of travel of the pull tabs;(d) connecting the clamper through the link
opening to the pull tab;(e) clamping the slider together with the pull tab
by closing the link opening and;(f) withdrawing the clamped slider past the
horizontal path of the pull tabs for storage.  According to another aspect of the invention,there
is provided an apparatus for attaching a pull tab
substantially automatically onto a slider body which
comprises a pull tab transport unit, a clamper applying
unit and a clamping unit; the pull tab transport unit
including a pull tab transfer chute having a pair of
elongate horizontal guide rails 16a and 16b defining
therebetween

<CLAIMS>
A method of attaching a pull tab (S
9
) onto a
slider body (S
1
) which comprises the steps of:

(a) feeding a series of pull tabs (S
9
)
intermittently one at a time along a horizontal path of

travel with an opening (S
13
) in a coupling link (S
11
) of
each pull tab (S
9
) oriented to face upward;
(b) feeding a series of unclamped sliders (S)
intermittently one at a time along a separate horizontal

path of travel above said horizontal path of pull tabs
(S
9
), with a clamper (S
7
) vertically suspended from each
slider body (S
1
);
(c) lifting said clamper (S
7
) pivotally to lie
substantially horizontally parallel with respect to the

horizontal path of travel of said pull tabs (S
9
);
(d) connecting said clamper (S
7
) through said
opening (S
13
) to said pull tab (S
9
);
(e) clamping said slider (S) together with said
pull tab (S
9
) by closing said opening (S
13
); and
(f) withdrawing said clamped slider (S) past the
holizontal path of said pull tabs (S
9
) for storage.
A method according to claim 1 which further
comprises flipping said pull tabs (S
9
) through 180° to
assume the same side prior to connection with said

sliders (S).
A method according to claim 1 which further
comprises detecting said clamped slider (S) for the

presence of a slider body (S
1
) and for proper clamping
to said pull tab (S
9
). 
An apparatus (10) for attaching a pull tab (S
9
)
substantially automatically onto a slider body (S
1
)
which comprises a pull tab transport unit (11), a

clamper applying unit (12) and a clamping unit (13);
said pull tab transport unit (11) including a pull tab

transfer chute (15) having a pair of elongate horizontal
guide rails 16a and 16b defining therebetween a

longitudinal guide slit (17) for receiving a series of
pull tabs (S
9
) and a transfer conveyor (20) movable
reciprocally along a rectangular path to transfer said

pull tabs (S
9
) intermittently one at a time through said
chute (15); said clamper applying unit (12) including a

horizontally extending slider supply chute (33), a
slider holder (39) vertically movable toward and away

including a clamper detecter (31) for detecting whether

or not the slider (S) has been properly clamped together
with the pull tab (S
9
) and a slider body detector (32)
for detecting the presence of the slider body (S
1
) as
connected with the pull tab (S
9
), both said detectors
(31) and (32) being located adjacent to the outlet end
