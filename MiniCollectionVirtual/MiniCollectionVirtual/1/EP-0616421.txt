<ABSTRACT>
A regulated cascode circuit with enhanced gain includes a cascode 
section including a common source MOS transistor (m₁) of a first polarity 

and a cascode device (m₂) wherein the drain of the common-source MOS 
transistor (m₁) is coupled to the source of the cascode device. An input to the 

regulated cascode circuit is applied to the common source MOS transistor 
(m₁) and an output of the regulated cascode circuit is developed at the drain 

of the cascode device (m₂) across both the common source MOS transistor 
(m₁) and cascode (m₂) device. A feedback amplifier circuit (10) has its input 

(12) connected to the drain of the common source MOS transistor (m₁) and its 
output (20) connected to a gate of the cascode device (m₂) for driving the 

cascode device (m₂). The feedback amplifier (10) includes a source follower 
MOS transistor (m₈) of a second polarity opposite the polarity of the common 

source MOS transistor (m₁) for sensing voltage developed at the drain of the 
common-source MOS transistor (m₁). A common gate MOS transistor (m₉) of 

the first polarity has its source coupled to a source of the source follower 
MOS transistor (m₈), and a steering device coupled (m₅ and m₆) to the drain 

of the common gate MOS transistor (m₉) for steering current developed in 
the source follower MOS transistor (m₈) and common gate MOS transistor 

(m₉) combination to a load device (m₇). The load device (m₇) is coupled to 
current steering device (m₅ and m₆) for developing a voltage to be supplied to 

the output of the feedback amplifier (10) and to the gate of the cascode device 
(m₂). The drain of the common source MOS transistor (m₁) is clamped to a 

desired voltage thus providing maximum voltage swing for small signal 
voltage at the output of the regulated cascode circuit while keeping the  

 
common source MOS transistor and cascode device (m₁ and m₂) in the high 

gain saturation region. The feedback amplifier (10) also receives a bias 
voltage from a separate bias circuit (Fig. 7) to establish the desired voltage at 

the drain of the common source MOS transistor (m₁) wherein the bias 
voltage is supplied to the gate of the common gate MOS transistor (m₉).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for enhancing the gain of 
MOS common-source amplifier stages which circuit utilizes the "regulated 
cascode" configuration. More particularly, the present invention relates to a 
circuit for enhancing the gain of MOS common-source amplifier stages which 
circuit utilizes a simple five-transistor feedback amplifier. The present 
invention may be used in any linear integrated circuit that needs a high gain 
amplifier. A technique recently published for enhancing the gain of MOS 
common-source amplifier stages is the "regulated cascode". To see the 
development of this technique, first look at a simple common-source stage as 
shown in Fig. 1. As shown in this drawing, rds1 
is the drain-source conductance inherant to device m₁, and RL is the external 
load resistance. If rds1 were not present, the gain of this amplifier could be 
made arbitrarily high by selecting arbitrarily large values of RL, since in this 
case 
Vout/Vin = -gm1 x RLBut, with rds1 in place, 
Vout/Vin = -gm1 x (rds1 RL) and the gain would be limited to at most -gm1rds1. Physically, this is because the small signal voltage across rds1 is the 
same as the output voltage, and this causes a small signal current to flow 
through rds1. This diverts some of the current gm1Vin from the device 
transconductance away from RL, reducing the small signal output voltage 
developed. A widespread circuit technique for gain enhancement is the cascode 
configuration shown in Fig. 2. In this circuit, a current is2 is flowing into the 
source of MOS transistor m₂. The impedance to small-signal ground from 
the source of transistor m₂ is approximately 1/gm2 across rds1, and 
KCL(Kirchoffs current law) at the source of transistor m₂ gives: 
gm1Vin + is2 + (is2/gm2)/rds1 = 0 but, 
is2 = Vout/RL   therefore 
gm1Vin + Vout/RL + Vout/gm2RLrds1 = 0    or 
Vout/Vin = -gm1[ compared to a simple common-source amplifier, the gain is now only limited 
by the parallel combination of RL and (gm2RL)rds1 instead of RL and rds1. 
Therefore, the effective drain-source resistance of transistor m₁ has been 
multiplied by gm2RL (the "gain" of transistor m₂) and much higher gains 
may be realized by increasing RL. Thus, the basic idea of the cascode circuit 
is to clamp the drain voltage of amplifier device m₁ independent of the 
output voltage which is the drain of cascode device m₂, but still allow  
 
whatever drain current generated by device m₁, or controlled by the input 
voltage, to flow through to the load resistance to develop
