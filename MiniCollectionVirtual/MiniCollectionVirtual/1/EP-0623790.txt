<ABSTRACT>
A water heater comprising a tank (14) adapted to hold 
water, a water outlet (62) communicating with the 

tank (14), a water inlet (46) communicating with the 
tank (14) and communicable with the outlet (62) 

independently of the tank (14), and a temperature 
responsive valve (86) in the tank (14) for permitting 

unrestricted communication of heated water in the 
tank (14) with the water outlet (62) when the water 

temperature in the tank (14) is below a first 
predetermined value, and for restricting 

communication of heated water in the tank (14) with 
the water outlet (62) when the water temperature in 

the tank (14) is above the first predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to water heaters, and more particularly to 
water heaters including arrangements for reducing or limiting the 
temperature of the outgoing hot water. It is known to provide in a water heater a plug having a cold 
water inlet and a hot water outlet. The cold water inlet is typically 
connected to a dip tube which extends to the bottom of the water tank. 
The hot water outlet delivers hot water from the tank to a network of 
pipes for delivery to a tap or taps usually in coordination with a parallel 
network of pipes that deliver cold water to the tap or taps. In the 
conventional water heater, the cold water inlet and hot water outlet are 
completely independent except for communication with the tank. It is also known in the art to provide a mixing valve connected 
between the cold water inlet pipe and the hot water outlet pipe remote 
from or immediately adjacent the water heater. Such a valve includes a 
thermostatic device operable to detect the temperature of the water in 
the hot water pipe and to introduce cold water into the hot water pipe 
when the hot water temperature is too high, thereby reducing the  
 
temperature of the hot water delivered and the attendant risk of scalding 
someone using the hot water tap. A valve of this type is disclosed in 
US 2967666. According to the present invention there is provided a water 
heater comprising: 
a tank adapted to hold water, a water outlet arranged to permit passage of water from said 
tank, a water inlet arranged to permit passage of water to said tank 
and to permit passage of water to said outlet independently of said tank,  heating means for heating water in said tank, and temperature responsive means for permitting unrestricted 
passage of heated water from said tank to said water outlet when the 
water temperature in said tank is below a first predetermined value, and 
for restricting passage of heated water from said tank to said water outlet 
when the water temperature in said tank is above said first 
predetermined value, and characterized in that the temperature 
responsive means is located within said tank. Conveniently, an opening is provided in the top wall of the 
tank, a plug being threaded into the opening. The plug seals the 
opening and defines a cold water inlet passage, a hot water outlet 
passage communicating with the tank via an intake port, and a by-pass 
passage connecting the cold water inlet passage with the hot water outlet  
 
passage. Temperature responsive means in the form of a temperature 
respon

<CLAIMS>
A water heater comprising: 

a tank (14) adapted to hold water, 
a water outlet (62) arranged to permit passage of water from 
said tank (14), 
a water inlet (46) arranged to permit passage of water to said 
tank (14) and to permit passage of water to said outlet (62) independently 

of said tank (14), 
heating means (26) for heating water in said tank (14), and 
temperature responsive means for permitting unrestricted 
passage of heated water from said tank (14) to said water outlet (62) 

when the water temperature in said tank (14) is below a first 
predetermined value, and for restricting passage of heated water from 

said tank (14) to said water outlet (62) when the water temperature in 
said tank (14) is above said first predetermined value, and characterized 

in that the temperature responsive means (86) is located within said tank 
(14). 
A water heater as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that said 
temperature responsive means (86) prevents passage of heated water 

from said tank (14) to said water outlet (62) when the water temperature 
in said tank (14) is above a second predetermined value. 
A water heater as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized 
in that said temperature responsive means (86) variably restricts passage 

of heated water from said tank (14) to said water outlet (62) when the 
water temperature in said tank (14) is above said first predetermined 

value.  
 
A water heater as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said 

temperature responsive means (86) selectively varies 
communication of said water inlet (46) with said 

water outlet (62) when the water temperature in said 
tank (14) is above said first predetermined value. 
A water heater as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by an opening (22) in 

said tank (14), plug means (34) threadably received 
in said opening (22) and defining said water inlet 

(46) and said water outlet (62), and wherein said 
temperature responsive means (86) is at least 

partially in said plug means (34). 
A water heater as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that said plug means (34) defines a 

hot water passage (58) between said tank (14) and 
said water outlet (62), and a cold water passage (38) 

between said water inlet (46) and said tank (14), and 
wherein said temperature responsive means (86) is at 

least partially in said hot water passage (58). 
A water heater as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that said temperature responsive 

means (86) selectively permits communication between 
said cold water passage (38) and said water outlet 

(62). 
A water heater as claimed in Claim 7, 
characterized in that said plug (34) further defines 

a by-pass passage (82) between said cold water 
passage (38) and said hot water passage (58) and 

wherein said temperature responsive means (86)  
 

selectively opens and closes said by-pass passage 
(82) when the water temperature in said tank (14) is 

above said first predetermined value. 
A water heater as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that said 

temperature responsive means (86) includes 
temperature adjustment means (178) for adjusting the
