<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method of
separating phytate and manganese from protein and dietary fiber and
more particularly to a method of using alumina to separate phytate
from protein and dietary fiber.It is desirable to remove manganese from rice protein because
the inherent level of manganese in rice alone may be greater than
the total desired in a nutritional product, such as a liquid
nutritional formula for infants.Phytic acid, also known as inositol hexaphosphate, is a
myo-inositol molecule in which all the hydroxy groups have been
replaced by phosphate groups as shown in Figure 1. Phytic acid is
the source of up to 85% of the total phosphorus in many cereals and
legumes. Phytates are the salts of phytic acid. Phytic acid is
believed to reduce the bioavailability of essential minerals by
forming complexes with them. Also, it may influence the functional
and nutritional value of proteins. Aluminum is known to form
complexes with phosphates. Classically, aluminum sulfate, commonly
known as alum, has been used to remove inorganic phosphates in water
purification processes. Alumina (aluminum oxide, Al2O3) is insoluble
in water, practically insoluble in organic solvents, and only
slightly soluble in aqueous alkaline solutions with the formation of
hydroxides. The ability of the aluminum portion of the aluminum
oxide to attach to the phosphate portion of phytate was the
theoretical and practical basis for its initial experimental use in 
the reduction of phytate in proteins.In a typical commercial process, soy proteins are extracted at
slightly alkaline pH from defatted soy flake or defatted soy flour.
The major protein fraction is then precipitated from the clarified
extract by adjusting the pH to the isoelectric point of the proteins
(pH 3.8 to 6.0). Inasmuch as the proteins are insoluble at this pH
the protein curd can be separated from soluble sugars, salts, etc.,
by centrifugation. To complete the purification, the protein curd is
washed with water at least once at this isoelectric pH, then the
protein is spray-dried either as is or after resuspension at neutral
pH. Under such prior art conditions, a major portion of the phytate
present in the soy flour will complex with the protein and will be
present in the soy isolate. Commercial soy isolates typically have
a phytate content of 2.0-2.5% and in some instances as much as 3% by
weight.The prior art contains many examples of methods of separating
phytic acid, and phytates, from protein. The desirability of an
economical method of
