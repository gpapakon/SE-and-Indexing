<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (10) for processing photographic material and which 
comprises a process bath filled with a liquid delivered from a 

storage container (15), the storage container (15) being placed on a 
trolley (50) and connected to the bath by a push-in/pull-out cap 

(30) engagable with the mouth of said container and having a 
passageway connected by conduits to the process bath (12, 13), the 

cap (30) and conduits connected thereto being mounted on a support 
plate (42) pivoted to a frame (46) of the apparatus so that the cap - 

(30) can be raised and lowered into and out of the mouth of the 
container (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for processing photographic
material, comprising a process bath connected to a storage container
for process liquid.The application is particularly relevant to storage containers
for photo-chemical products for use with apparatus for processing
photographic materials.Photographic processing apparatus will typically comprise a
developing section, a fixing section, a wash section and a drier.The process liquids for the developing section and the fixer
section are typically provided in containers having an opening
closed by a screw threaded cap. Such containers can be in the form
of rigid moulded polyethylene containers, or collapsible containers
consisting of a collapsible plastic cube insert within a corrugated
board outer support.The apparatus supply conduit from the container to the
respective section of the apparatus are normally coupled to the
container by means of a screw threaded coupling to which a supply
conduit is attached. This makes coupling and uncoupling the
container to the apparatus cumbersome since either the supply
conduits become twisted, or the container has to be rotated during
coupling. Furthermore such a cumbersome coupling system may lead to
messy spills and wastage.It is object of the invention to provide an improved processing
apparatus incorporating a simple push-in construction of cap which
permits quick coupling and uncoupling of containers without
spillage. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided an
apparatus for processing photographic material and which comprises
at least one process bath, the or each bath being filled with a
liquid delivered to the bath from a storage container, the storage
container being connected to the bath by a push-in/pull-out cap
having a radially expandable and contractible resilient seal
engagable with the mouth of said container and having a passageway
connected by conduits to the respective process bath, said cap and
conduits connected thereto being mounted on a support plate pivoted
to a frame of the apparatus so that the cap can be raised and
lowered into and out of the mouth of the container, wherein the cap
has a cap body and a stepped piston carried by said cap body for
limited back-and-forth relative movement, said seal being contacted
by said stepped piston , whereby relative movement of said stepped
piston in one direction compresses said seal axially to expand the
same against the mouth surfaces and in the opposite direction
relaxes the seal to contract the same, and the seal is

Apparatus (10) for processing photographic material and
which comprises at least one process bath (12, 13), the or each bath

(12, 13) being filled with a liquid delivered to the bath from a
storage container (15), the storage container (15) being connected

to the bath by a push-in/pull-out cap (30) having a radially
expandable and contractible resilient seal (35) engagable with the

mouth of said container and having a passageway (44) connected by
conduits (17, 18) to the respective process bath (12, 13), said cap

(30) and conduits (17, 18) connected thereto being mounted on a
support plate (42) pivoted to a frame (46) of the apparatus so that

the cap (30) can be raised and lowered into and out of the mouth of
the container (15),

wherein the cap (30) has a cap body (31) and a stepped piston (32)
carried by said cap body for limited back-and-forth relative

movement, said seal (35) being contacted by said stepped piston ,
whereby relative movement of said stepped piston in one direction

compresses said seal axially to expand the same against the mouth
surfaces and in the opposite direction relaxes the seal to contract

the same, and the seal is compressed and relaxed axially through
operation of a handle (37) pivotally mounted on the cap for movement

between cap-sealed and cap-unsealed positions, said handle having a
cam surface (39) thereon operative upon pivotal movement of the

handle to move said stepped piston in said directions, the handle
also functioning as a means for holding the container (15).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein there is further
provided on the support plate (42) an electrical switch (47) which

is operated by a portion (43) of said handle (37) when the handle is
in the 'cap sealed' position. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the cap (30) has two
fluid passageways (44) therein communicating with a delivery conduit

(17) leading to the bath (12, 13) and with a return conduit (18)

from the bath (12, 13), respectively.
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein a delivery pump (19)
for delivery of liquid from the container (15) to the bath (12, 13),

and a return pump (25) for discharging liquid from the bath (12, 13)
to the container (15) are mounted on said support plate (42) and

connected into said delivery and return conduit.
Apparatus according to claim 1, which comprises a trolley (50)
onto which a new full container (15) can be loaded, the arrangement

of the trolley being such that the cap fits into the mouth of said
loaded container as the trolley has been inserted in the apparatus

and the support plate (42) bearing said cap is pivoted downwardly.
