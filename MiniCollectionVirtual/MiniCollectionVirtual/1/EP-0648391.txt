<ABSTRACT>
An improved synchronous tracking AM receiver having low power requirements and a small size. The synchronous tracking AM receiver provides signal tracking capability and sensitivity approaching a conventional superheterodyne receiver. The synchronous tracking AM receiver includes an RF amplifier synchronous input section which couples input signals to a synchronization filter circuit, including a modified Colpitts oscillator. The Colpitts oscillator recycles the signal to generate a high Q output signal. The output signal of the synchronization circuit is coupled to a low pass filter, then amplified by a low frequency amplifier and triggered to produce a digital output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to AM receivers 
and more particularly to an improved synchronous tracking AM 
receiver with characteristics approaching a conventional 
superhetrodyne narrow band receiver. AM receivers are utilized in numerous applications and 
are desirable for utilization in low power, small size 
applications, such as in portable command receivers. To 
obtain the desired sensitivity, most conventional AM receivers 
are of a superhetrodyne design or are based upon the 
superhetrodyne design. The superhetrodyne design produces the 
desired operating characteristics, but at the cost of 
relatively large size components and high power requirements 
which result in a large size receiver unit. This essentially 
precludes the superhetrodyne design from utilization in small 
size and/or low power applications. Applicant researched the available receiver designs with 
a desired goal of designing a low power, small size AM 
receiver. In doing this research, applicant discovered some 
publications by Vasil Uzunoglu, such as The SynchronousOscillator : A Synchronization and Tracking Network, IEEE 
JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, Vol.SC-20, No.6, December, 
1985, directed to a synchronous oscillator for use in clock 
recovery systems. Applicant analyzed the circuit and 
surmised that the circuit must be operating to also 
demodulate the tracked signal. Applicant then built a test 
circuit to simulate what Applicant thought must be the active 
demodulating node. The test circuit initially appeared not 
to work or to not produce the surmised demodulated signal. 
Applicant, after further analysis, again concluded that the 
circuit must be producing a demodulated signal. Applicant 
again modulated the input of the test circuit with an RF 
signal, but additionally added a low pass filter coupled to 
the believed active node. The low pass filter revealed the 
presence of the demodulated signal, which resulted in the 
present invention. From reviewing the V. Uzonoglu articles, 
it is apparent that the demodulating capability of the 
synchronous oscillator was not discovered by V. Uzonoglu. Furtheron Funkschau, Volume 62, Number 20,21 September 
1990, Munich, pages 113-115 entitled "Einfacher Kurzwellen-Empfanger" 
, by H. Karpa, describes a receiver utilizing a two-stage oscillator whereby 
the low frequency is derived from an emitter circuit of a 
high frequency stage via a capacitor, a low frequency 
pre-stage and a volume controller. The present invention therefore was developed to solve 
the
