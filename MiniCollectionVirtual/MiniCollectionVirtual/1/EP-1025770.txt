<ABSTRACT>
A shoe (1) is provided, in particular a sports shoe, comprising a stability element (10) to
adjust in a controlled way the rotatability of the forefoot part (3) of the shoe around

the longitudinal axis with respect to the rearfoot part (2), wherein the stability
element comprises a base element extending from the rearfoot part (2) into the

forefoot part (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a shoe, in particular to a sports shoe with a stability
element to control the rotatability of the forefoot area with respect to the rearfoot
area of the shoe.The processes in the human foot during walking or running are characterized by
an enormous complexity. Between the first contact of the heel and the push-off
with the toes a number of different movements take place in the whole foot.
During these movements, a plurality of parts of the foot move or turn with respect
to each other.It is the objective in the construction of "normal" shoes, in particular of sport
shoes, to obstruct these natural movements (as they occur in barefoot running) as
little as possible and to support the foot only where it is necessary (depending on
the intended use of the shoe). In other words, it is attempted to simulate walking
or running without shoes.In contrast thereto, it is an objective of orthopaedic shoes to correct malpositions
or orthopedical deformities of the foot for example by reinforcing the material in
certain parts of the sole to provide additional support for the foot. The present
invention, however, does not relate to this aspect but relates only to the
construction of shoes for "normal" feet, in particular "normal" sports shoes in the
above meaning. In this context, it was already realized in the past that the classical outsole which
extends over the whole area of the shoe does not meet the above mentioned
requirements. In particular rotations of the forefoot area around the longitudinal
axis of the foot with respect to the rearfoot area (referred to in physics as torsional
movements) are at least considerably hindered by a homogeneously formed,
continuous outsole or an arrangement of soles.To overcome these difficulties, stability elements were developed which connect
with a controlled rotational flexibility separate parts of the sole, and which define
by their form and their material the resistance of the sole against such twisting
movements.One example for such known stability element is disclosed in the US-A-5 647
145. The shoe sole construction described in this prior art approach complements
and augments the natural flexing actions of the muscles of the heel, metatarsals
and toes of the foot. To meet this objective, the sole comprises a base of
resiliently compressible material, a plurality of forward support pads supporting
the toes, a plurality of rearward support lands supporting the metatarsals, a heel
member supporting and protecting the heel of the wearer's foot, and
