<ABSTRACT>
A managing method includes steps of selecting a 
function according to the type of an electrode mounted on the 

portable blood sugar value-measuring apparatus (step S4); 
executing a process of clocking a predetermined period of time 

(steps S6, S32, S42); deciding whether or not the clocking 
process has been switched over to a different process while 

the predetermined period of time is being clocked (steps S7, 
S31, S41); and reading out data of measured blood sugar values 

stored in a storing means from a termination point of the 
first predetermined period of time when the first predetermined 

period of time has terminated without the switch-over 
from the first clocking process to the blood sugar value-measuring 

process being decided in the deciding process (steps 
S8, S33, S43).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data managing 
method in a portable blood sugar value-measuring apparatus and 
the portable blood sugar value-measuring apparatus which 
carries out the data managing method. The method and the 
apparatus can be used by a patient himself/herself to measure 
his/her blood sugar value. People know a portable blood sugar value-measuring 
apparatus which stores data of blood sugar values sequentially 
measured by a diabetic for himself/herself. In reading out 
a plurality of the stored data of the measured blood sugar 
values in such a conventional blood sugar value-measuring 
apparatus, an operation button provided on the surface thereof 
is depressed to display them sequentially on a display 
portion. As disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
No. 357452/1992, the present applicant proposed a blood 
sugar value-measuring apparatus having no operation buttons  
 
provided thereon. In the blood sugar value-measuring 
apparatus disclosed in the Patent Publication, various types 
of electrodes such as a blood sugar value-measuring one, 
correcting one and the like having its own resistance value 
are installed on the blood sugar value-measuring apparatus. 
When one of them is mounted on the blood sugar value-measuring 
apparatus, its resistance value is detected and then, the 
blood sugar value-measuring apparatus is set to operation 
state. In addition, which type of the electrodes has been 
installed on the blood sugar value-measuring apparatus can be 
detected based on its resistance value. In this manner, a 
function of each type of electrode is performed in the blood 
sugar value-measuring apparatus. This construction eliminates 
the need for the provision of an operation switch. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
improved data managing method which is used in a portable 
blood sugar value-measuring apparatus having no operation 
buttons in order to eliminate the provision of the operation 
on reading a plurality of measured blood sugar values and to 
provide the portable blood sugar value-measuring apparatus 
storing the measured blood sugar values in a storing means 
sequently, reading the measured blood sugar values from the 
storing means, or the like. In accomplishing the aforementioned object,  
 
according to one aspect of the present invention of the data 
managing method, there is provided a data managing method, to 
be carried out in a portable blood sugar value-measuring 
apparatus having no operation button, of selectively and
