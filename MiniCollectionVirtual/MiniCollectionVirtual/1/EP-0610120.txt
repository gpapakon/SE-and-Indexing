<ABSTRACT>
A method for the treatment of solid products which cannot be discharged without harming the environment, according to which solid products to be treated are dehydrated in a dehydration zone (1), they are thermolysed in a thermolysis zone (2), solid residues are extracted from this thermolysis zone, thermolysis gases formed in this thermolysis zone are sucked out using pumping means (10, 20) so as to keep this thermolysis zone under reduced pressure, characterised in that these thermolysis gases are maintained, from this thermolysis zone as far as at least the inlet of the pumping means (10, 20), at a temperature of greater than approximately 100@C, and these gases are used as fuel in a boiler (12) and heat energy is recovered at the outlet of this boiler.

Process for the treatment of solid products, the dumping
of which is harmful to the environment, according to which

solid products to be treated are dehydrated in a dehydration
area (1), they are thermally dissociated in a thermolysis area

(2), solid residues are extracted from this thermolysis area,
and thermolysis gases formed in this thermolysis area are

sucked out by pumping means (10, 20) so as to keep this
thermolysis area under negative pressure, characterised in

that from this thermolysis area at least until the inlet of
the pumping means (10,20) the thermolysis gases are kept

at a temperature above approximately 100째C , and these gases
are used as a fuel in a boiler (12) and heat energy is

recovered at the outlet of this boiler.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that fuel
recovered from the solid residues is also (14) applied to the

boiler.
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in
that the thermolysis gases sucked from the thermolysis area

are heated (50) to a temperature above approximately 850째C,
before they are applied to the inlet of the pumping means (10,

20).
Process according to Claim 3, characterised in that these
thermolysis gases are heated to a temperature of at least

1250째C approximately.
Process according to Claim 3 or Claim 4, characterised in
that these gases are heated (17) with fumes from the boiler

(12).
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the thermolysis gases are sucked out by 

passing them through a steam ejector (20) using steam formed
in the boiler (12), and then into a separator (22) from which

emerges, in addition to these thermolysis gases, water
supplying the boiler.
Process according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
water emerging from the separator is neutralised (23) before

it is returned to the boiler to be converted into steam.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the boiler fumes are used (17) to heat

the dehydration area.
Installation for the treatment of solid products, the
dumping of which is harmful to the environment, including a

dehydration area (1) into which the solid products enter, a
thermolysis area (12) downstream of the dehydration area, an

outlet area for solid residues and pumping means (10, 20)
communicating via an extraction line (11) with the thermolysis

area in order to keep it at negative pressure and suck
thermolysis gases from it, characterised in that the pumping

means (10, 20) have a range of operating temperatures higher,
at least in part, than approximately 100째C, in that the

extraction line (11) is insulated (11A) over its entire length
as far as the pumping means (10, 20), and in that these

pumping means communicate via a fuel gas feed line (13) with a
boiler (12) suitable for burning these thermolysis gases.
Installation according to Claim 9, characterised in that
it includes a reactor (15) disposed downstream of the

thermolysis area into which the solid residues enter and
communicating with the boiler (12) via a solid fuel feed line

(14).
Installation according to Claim 9 or Claim 10,
characterised in that the extraction line (11) passes through

a heater (50). 
Installation according to Claim 11, characterised in that
this heater (50) is a heat exchanger supplied by fumes from

the boiler (12).
Installation according to any one of Claims 9 to 12,
characterised in that the pumping means (10) include a dry-operation

vacuum pump.
Installation according to any one of Claims 9 to 12,
characterised in that the pumping means (20) include a steam

ejector (20A) provided with a steam inlet communicating with
an outlet of the boiler, and in that this installation also

includes, downstream of this ejector, a separator (22)
provided with a gas outlet connected to the fuel gas feed

line, and with a water outlet connected via a feed line to a
water inlet of the boiler.
Installation according to Claim 14, characterised in that
a neutralization tank is disposed on the water feed line, and

is provided with a neutralization reagent feed line (24).
Installation according to any one of Claims 9 to 15,
characterised in that the dehydration and thermolysis areas

are provided with enclosures (1A, 2A) communicating via a line
with the boiler fume outlet.
Installation according to any one of Claims 9 to 16,
characterised in that a turbine (19) is mounted at the boiler

outlet.
