Domestic appliance, in particular domestic cooking appliance, having

a) at least one heating device for thermal treatment of a domestic product,
b) a specified quantity of different operating states, each being defined by a
thermal operating parameter for the heating device on the one hand and by

a further operating parameter or one of plural specified operating
programmes on the other hand,
c) at least one operating element (2, 21 to 24), which is movable within a
specified spatial range in two mutually orthogonal spatial directions between

plural specified setting positions (Eij),
d) position detection means (Mij, 3) for detecting the current position (P) of the
at least one operating element and comparing this current position with the

specified setting positions (Eij, E1 to E4), in which case a setting position is
allocated to each specified operating state in that one coordinate value of

the setting position in one of the two spatial directions corresponds to one
value of the thermal operating parameter and one coordinate value of the

setting position in the other of the two spatial positions corresponds to a
value of the other operating parameter or to an operating programme or an

operating function, and having
e) control means (4) for setting one of the specified operating states if the
position detecting means has established agreement of the current position

of the at least one operating element with the setting position allocated to
this operating state.
Domestic appliance according to claim 1, wherein the control means set the
operating state only after the elapse of a predetermined time interval, after

which the operating element has reached the associated setting position.
Domestic appliance according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the control
means set different operating states after uninterrupted remaining of the 

operating element in at least one of the setting positions after the elapse of
different specified time intervals.
Domestic appliance according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein one setting
position is allocated unambiguously to each operating state.
Domestic appliance according to one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the setting
positions of the operating element are arranged at least approximately in the

form of a matrix.
Domestic appliance according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the
operating element is rotatable in two independent rotational directions in

order to move into one of the setting positions.
Domestic appliance according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the
operating element is guided in respective guides extending parallel to each

of the two spatial directions in order to move into one of the setting positions.
Domestic appliance according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the
position detection means comprise position sensors (Mij) and evaluating

means (3) for evaluating the sensor signals of the position sensors disposed

at specified positions in order to determine the current position (P) of the
operating element (2).
Domestic appliance according to one of the preceding claims, having catch
means for locking the operating element in the operating positions.
Domestic appliance according to one of the preceding claims, having
resetting means allocated to the operating element, which move the

operating element back into a specified starting position within the specified
spatial range. 
Domestic appliance according to one of the preceding claims, having a
display, on which the operating state set may be indicated with one or more

associated marks or indicating means (5), wherein the marks or indicating
means allocated to the selectable operating states or to at least one of the

operating parameters or operating programmes or operating functions are
arranged relative to one another like the associated setting positions of the

operating element.
Domestic appliance according to one of the preceding claims, in the form of
a washing machine, wherein the heating device for thermal treatment of

laundry to be washed heats a washing liquid.
Domestic appliance according to one of claims 1 to 11, in the form of a
dishwasher, wherein the heating device for thermal treatment of articles to

be washed heats a washing liquid.
Domestic appliance according to one of claims 1 to 11, in the form of a
tumble-dryer, wherein the heating device heats laundry to be dried.
Domestic appliance according to one of claims 1 to 11, in the form of a
cooking appliance, which in particular comprises an oven and/or hob,

wherein the heating device heats food to be cooked.
Domestic appliance according to claim 15, wherein the cooking appliance
comprises a hob with a specified number of cooking zones, each cooking

zone comprising an associated heating device and a respective associated
operating element being allocated to each cooking zone in order to set an

operating state of the cooking zone.
Domestic appliance according to claim 15 or claim 16, wherein the thermal
operating parameter corresponds to a particular cooking intensity and as 

operating programmes, respective specified cooking processes or specified
cooking programmes are provided.
