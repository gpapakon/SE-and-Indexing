<ABSTRACT>
An active carbon sheet is obtained by mixing active carbon in paper, and a solution of an amine compound is sprayed on 
this sheet or this sheet is immersed in the same solution, the resultant sheet being dried to obtain a sheet type methyl bromide 

removing material. The methyl bromide remaining after the fumigation, in which methyl bromide is used, of an agricultural product 
is removed by means of this methyl bromide removing material. This sheet type methyl bromide removing material prevents 

an increase, which causes damage to an agricultural product, in the concentration of methyl bromide discharged gradually from 
an agricultural product into a container. It also prevents such methyl bromide from being discharged to the atmospheric air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet material for
eliminating methyl bromide which, after a fumigating operation
with methyl bromide, is available for eliminating remaining methyl
bromide, and to a process for eliminating remaining methyl bromide
with it.To use methyl bromide is indispensable in extermination of
vermin in importing or exporting agricultural products and before
storage thereof. As an instance involving use of a large amount of
methyl bromide, there is a case of fumigating agricultural products,
particularly fruits and vegetables with methyl bromide in exporting
or importing them. In many case, methyl bromide remaining after the
fumigation is subjected to burning or alkali-washing treatment
requiring much cost.In common farmers, however, such disposal of the remaining
methyl bromide cannot usually be carried out owing to economic
problems and thus it is emitted into the atmosphere, as it is.In case of fumigating agricultural products with methyl
bromide, the remaining methyl bromide immediately after completion
of the fumigating treatment is treated by e.g., the above-mentioned 
manner, until the environment in a fumigating warehouse reaches at
least a level of a work-permitting standard. Then, the agricultural
products will be preserved within a certain period by storing them
in a storehouse or by packing them into boxes. During such a
preserving period, methyl bromide kept in the agricultural products
by the fumigating treatment is gradually emitted off. In a certain
instance, the concentration of methyl bromide in a container was
over 500 ppm.In such cases, when people work in the state that-the container
is open, a high level of methyl bromide may be emitted around the
working area, thereby effecting a bad influence on human bodies. In
the light of the recent position of preservation of the environment
of the earth, restriction of emitting halogen compounds is
important. In view of this matter, emitting methyl bromide into the
atmosphere is not preferred. Furthermore, a high level of methyl
bromide in the container contacts the agricultural products for a
long time, so that both drop in their qualities and injury may
occur. Thus, damages thereof are observed.In particular when an environmental change happens, for
example, the change such that temperature rises from a low
temperature as in a refrigerator to ambient temperature at a working
environment, much methyl bromide is emitted from agricultural
products. Thus, they are seriously injured. All of these phenomena
do not break
