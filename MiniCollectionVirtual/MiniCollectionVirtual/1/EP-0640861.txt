<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical
waveguide devices comprising an optical waveguide
substrate made of ferroelectric crystals.In the fields of optical measurement systems,
optical communication systems, etc., it is known to
manufacture optical waveguide devices by forming three
dimensional optical waveguides in various electro-optics
crystals.As for the optical waveguide devices, optical
branch devices, optical modulation devices, optical
polarization devices, optical switches, multiplexer, and
so on are known. The optical waveguide devices have
such advantages as small size, good stability, low
necessary power and high speed signal transmission.The inventors investigated the use of the
optical waveguide device, which is manufactured by
forming the three-dimensional optical waveguide of
Y-branch type in the substrate made of LiNbO3, as a
modulator for fiber optic gyroscopes. In this 
modulator, a light impinging upon one end of the optical
waveguide is divided by a ratio of 50:50% at a branch
portion of the optical waveguide. One of the divided
light is phase-modulated by applying a predetermined
voltage. Phase differences due to Sagnac effects, which
are generated by a rotation of the objected optical
systems, are detected by the optical waveguide device.
The thus obtained phase difference is introduced into a
formula showing the relation between a rotation angular
rate of the optical system and a phase difference to
obtain a rotation angular rate.The inventors further investigated an intensity
modulator of Mach-Zehnder type formed by arranging an
optical waveguide of Mach-Zehnder type in the substrate.
In this intensity modulator, a light impinging upon the
intensity modulator is divided. Respective divided
lights are phase-modulated by applying a voltage
thereto. Then, the modulated lights are interfered to
vary the intensity.During these investigations, the inventors faced
to the problems mentioned below. In the modulator for
fiber optic gyroscope, it is necessary to set the
dividing ratio substantially equal to 50:50. However,
especially in the modulator for fiber optic gyroscope,
an admission range of the dividing ratio is very narrow.
This is because, in the case that the dividing ratio is 
out of 50:50, the detected rotation angular rate is
largely varied even if the rotation rate of the optical
system is not varied.For example, if it is assumed that the dividing
ratio is temporarily varied from 50:50 to 40:60, the
obtained rotation angular rate is varied about 20%.
Therefore, in the
