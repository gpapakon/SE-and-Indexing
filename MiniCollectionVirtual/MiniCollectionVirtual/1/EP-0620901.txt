<ABSTRACT>
An internal shoe brake (13) has a substantially circular brake shoe (14) mounted on a support (20, 23) and having a mechanical actuator (17) located between a pair of opposed ends (15, 16) of the shoe for moving the brake shoe ends apart to apply the brake. The actuator takes the form of a first lever (31) pivotted at one end (32) on the support (23, 33) and connected at its other end (35) with a brake operating means such as a cable (24). The one end (32) of the first lever contacts one shoe end (16) and a second lever (41) is pivotted on the first lever. The second lever is operatively connected with the other shoe end (15) via a brake shoe clearance adjuster means (50). The brake shoe clearance adjuster means may be manually operated or may be automatic.

<DESCRIPTION>
 INTERNAL SHOE BRAKE WITH ADJUSTING DEVICEThis invention relates to internal show assemblies, in particular for vehicles, and which are of the type which utilise a single circular brake shoe.In British patent 1 090 058 there is described an internal shoe brake having a substantially circular single brake shoe mounted on a support with a mechanical actuator located between a pair of opposed ends thereof, the actuator causing said brake shoe ends to move apart to apply the brake.It is an object of the present invention to provide an internal shoe brake of the above type which includes a brake shoe wear compensation device.Thus according to the present invention there is provided an internal shoe brake having a substantially circular brake shoe mounted on a support and having a mechanical actuator located between a pair of opposed ends of the shoe for moving said brake shoe ends apart to apply the brake, the brake being characterised in that the 

 actuator comprises a first lever pivotted at one end on the support and having an abutment surface thereon for contacting one shoe end and a brake operating means connected to the other end of the first lever; a second lever pivotted at its one end away from the said first lever on the support and having an abutment surface thereon operatively connected with the other shoe end, the other end of the second lever being pivotally connected to said one end of said first lever; and a brake shoe clearance adjuster means mounted on the support and located between said other shoe end and the abutment surface on the second lever to transmit loads from the actuator to said other shoe end.The brake shoe clearance adjuster means may comprise a hollow sliding bush mounted on the support and having an internal screw thread and an abutment at one end for contact with the support, and a screw threaded tappet mounted in the bush, the tappet having a head portion abutting said other shoe end, the overall length of the adjuster means and hence the brake shoe clearance being adjustable by rotation of the bush. The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- 

Fig 1 is an elevation of an internal shoe brake according to the invention;Fig 2 is a section in the II-II of fig 1;Fig 3 is an elevation of the mounting block used inFig 1 for supporting the adjuster means;Fig 4 is a view of the adjuster means used in the brake of Fig 1;Fig 5 is an elevation of an alternative mounting block and belt-operated adjuster

 to transmit loads from the actuator (17) to said other shoe end (15).
2. A brake as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the abutment surface (44) on said second lever (41) includes a spigot (44a) which engages with a location aperture (53) in the adjuster means (50).
3. A brake as claimed in claim 1 and claim 2 characterised- in that the brake shoe clearance adjuster means (50) comprises a hollow sliding bush (52) mounted on the support (23) and having an internal screw thread (53) and an abutment (54) at one end for contact with the support, and a screw-threaded tappet (55) mounted in the bush, the tappet (55) having a head portion (56) abutting said other shoe end (15) the overall length of the adjuster means and hence the brake shoe clearance being adjustable by rotation of the bush (52).
4. A brake as claimed in claims 2 and 3 characterised in that the other end of the hollow bush (52) receives the spigot (44a) formed on the abutment surface (44) of the second lever (41). 


 5. A brake as claimed in claim 3 or claim 4 characterised in the bush (52) is provided with drive formations (60) engaged by complementary drive formations (61) on a manually operated adjuster member (62) part of which projects (62A) externally from the brake, movement (X) of the adjuster member (62) causing rotation of the bush (52) via the interengaging drive formations (60,61) to adjust the brake shoe clearance.
6. A brake as claimed in claim 5 characterised in that circumferentially spaced drive formations ( 60) are formed on the bush (52) , and the adjuster member comprises an endless loop (62) part of which is in encircling engagement with the drive formations (60) on the bush (52) and part (62A) of which projects from the brake, the brake shoe clearance being adjusted by longitudinal displacement (X) of the projecting part (62A) of the endless loop to rotate the bush (52).
7. A brake as claimed in claim 6 characterised in that the projecting part (62A) of the endless loop (62) projects from the brake via an aperture (66,67) in the support (23,20). 


8. A brake as claimed in claim 7 characterised in that the aperture (66,67) in the support (23,20) is sealed by a sealing member (68) through which the endless loop (62) projects.
9. A brake as claimed in any one of claims 6 to 8 characterised in that the endless loop (62) is an internally toothed belt or a chain which engages circumferentially spaced teeth (60) on the bush (52 ) .
10. A brake according to claims 1 and 2 characterised in that the adjuster means comprises an automatic brake shoe clearance adjuster (70) .
