<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device has a first semiconductor 
region (13,15,17) of a first conductivity type and a 

second semiconductor region (14) of a second 
conductivity type contacted by respective first and 

second electrodes (6,2). A semi-insulating layer (8) 
extends between the first and second electrodes (6,2) 

and there is a first insulating (4,7) between the 
semi-insulating layer (8) and the first semiconductor 

region (13,15,17). The sheet resistivity of the semi-insulating 
layer (8) varies and this improves the high 

breakdown voltage of the p-n junction of the 
semiconductor device between the first and second 

semiconductor layers, by acting as a shield for 
charges included on a passivation insulation layer 

(19) covering the semi-insulating layer (8) and the 
first and second electrodes (6,2). Third 

semiconductor regions (16), with corresponding third 
electrodes (5) extend around, and are spaced from, the 

second semiconductor region (14). The third 
electrodes (5) extend over the pa
rts of the first 
semiconductor region (13,15,17) adjacent the third 

semiconductor region (16) as this also improves the 
breakdown voltage. The second electrode (2) may also 

extend over the part of the first semiconductor region 
(13,15,17) adjacent the second semiconductor region 

(14) to cover the p-n junction therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor 
device having a semi-insulating layer. The term 
"semi-insulating" is used to denote materials have 
resistivities in a range between the resistivities of 
semiconductor materials and the resistivities of 
insulating materials. JP-A-52-27032 discloses a semiconductor device in 
the form of a planar type diode. The diode disclosed 
has a first semiconductor region of a first 
conductivity type and a second region of a second 
conductivity type extending into the first region. 
Electrodes contact the first and second regions, with 
the first semiconductor region having a highly doped 
part, through which it contacts the electrode to 
improve the electrical connection therebetween. In such a planar-type diode, a p-n junction is 
formed between the first and second semiconductor 
regions. When a reverse bias is applied to that p-n  
 
junction, a depletion region extends from the p-n 
junction and the spreading of that depletion region will 
affect the breakdown voltage of the diode. JP-A-52-27032 
proposes that the electrodes be interconnected by a semi-insulating 
layer, with that semi-insulating layer being 
separated from the first semiconductor region by an 
insulating layer. WO 85/03167 discloses a semiconductor structure with 
a resistive layer. The resistive layer is of uniform 
thickness and is applied in a pattern over the surface of 
the semiconductor structure. EP-A-0182422 (corresponding to the preamble of claim 1) also 
discloses a semiconductor covered by a resistive layer of substantially 
uniform thickness. There have been many other proposals which seek to 
improve the breakdown voltage of planar-type 
semiconductor diodes, which do not make use of semi-insulating 
layers. It is known to provide one or more 
third semiconductor regions, of the same conductivity 
type as the second semiconductor region, which surround, 
but do not contact, that second semiconductor region. 
Electrodes may then be provided which contact the third 
semiconductor region. JP-A-59-141267 proposes that the 
third semiconductor regions have extensions extending 
radially inwardly and/or outwardly. JP-A-59-76466 
suggests that there are a plurality of such third 
semiconductor regions, and the electrodes associated 
therewith extend radially beyond the inward periphery of 
the third semiconductor region, over the first  
 
semiconductor region. To prevent direct contact between 
the third electrodes and the first semiconductor region, 
there is insulating material
