<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a brake device comprising: a stator (10) fixed to the vehicle by a fixing lug (5); a rotor (6) comprising a first disc (13) and a second disc (16) rotating with the wheel, distant from each other and fixed relative to each other, the first disc being closer to the fixing lug (5); and clamping means comprising a fixed caliper (40) for braking the second disc (16). The invention is characterised in that the clamping means for braking the first disc comprise a sliding caliper (50).

Multi-disc braking device for a motor vehicle
equipped with at least one wheel rotating about a

transverse axis (X) in a direct rotation direction
which corresponds to forward travel of the vehicle,

this device comprising:

a stator (10) fixed to the vehicle by means
of at least one fixing arm (5);
a rotor (6) comprising a first disc (13) and
a second disc (16) which rotate with the wheel and are

spaced apart and fixed along the transverse axis (X),
the first disc being closer to the fixing arm than the

second disc, and the first and second discs having
internal faces (15) and (17) respectively which face

each other, and external faces (14) and (18)
respectively;
a first pair (140) and (150) and a second
pair (170) and (180) of friction pads interacting

respectively with the first disc and with the second
disc, each pair of pads comprising an internal pad

(150) or (170) and an external pad (140) or (180)
respectively pointing towards the internal and external

faces of the disc with which this pair of pads
interacts;
brake-application means themselves
comprising: at least one first piston (24) sliding in a

first cylinder (34) under the action of a first
hydraulic pressure to apply the first external pad

(140) against the first disc (13); a fixed caliper (40)
secured to the stator (10) and having an upstream end

(41) and a downstream end (42) which are spaced apart
in a direction tangential to the rotor and follow one

after the other in this order in the direct rotation
direction, this fixed caliper straddling the second

disc (16) and between its two ends carrying a second
internal cylinder (37) and a second external cylinder

(38) in which there slide respectively, under the
action of a second hydraulic pressure, a second 

internal piston (27) and a second external piston (28)
which are respectively capable of applying the second

internal pad (170) and second external pad (180)
against the second disc (16);
and connecting means for securing the two
ends (41) and (42) of the fixed caliper to the stator;
characterized in that
 the brake-application means
further comprise: a sliding caliper (50) having an

upstream end (51) and a downstream end (52) which are
spaced apart in a direction tangential to the rotor and

follow one after the other in this order in the direct
rotation direction, this sliding caliper carrying the

first cylinder (34) between its two ends (51) and (52),
straddling the first disc and having a tip (53)

arranged between the two discs, the first external pad
(140), the first disc (13) and the first internal pad

(150) thus being clamped between the first piston and
the tip of the sliding caliper; fixed upstream (11) and

downstream guiding means secured to the stator, and
moving upstream (151) and downstream guiding means

respectively secured to the upstream and downstream
ends of the sliding caliper, the moving upstream and

downstream guiding means being mounted respectively so
that they can slide with respect to the fixed upstream

and downstream guiding means in order to allow the
sliding caliper to slide with respect to the stator.
Braking device according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the tip (53) of the sliding
caliper comprises two parts (51) and (52) separated by

an empty space (54), and 
in that
 the second internal
cylinder (37) is arranged in this empty space.
Braking device according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the rotor (6) comprises at least
two parts, one of which includes the first disc (13),

and the other of which includes the second disc (16).
Braking device according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 between the
first and second discs the rotor is shaped like a hub

(7), and 
in that
 this hub is pierced with holes (8) for 
ventilating the internal faces (15) and (17) of the

discs.
Braking device according to any one of the
preceding claims, in which each cylinder has a

corresponding axis of symmetry, 
characterized in that

the axis of symmetry (S) of the first cylinder is
further forward, in the direct rotation direction, than

the axes of symmetry (T) and (U) of the second
cylinders.
Braking device according to any one of the
preceding claims, in which the first internal pad (150)

and the first external pad (140) each have an upstream
end (131) and a downstream end (132) which point

respectively towards the upstream end and the
downstream end of the sliding caliper, 
characterized in
that
 this first internal pad and this first external
pad are attached to the stator by their respective

upstream ends (131).
Braking device according to Claim 6,

characterized in that
 the first internal pad (150) and
first external pad (140) rest against the stator (10)

via their respective downstream ends (132).
Braking device according to any one of the
preceding claims,
