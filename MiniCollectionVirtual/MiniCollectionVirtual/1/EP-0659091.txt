<ABSTRACT>
A system for preparation of a medical solution, such as for dialysis, hemodiafiltration or hemofiltration, comprising a preferably conventional control monitor (1) with an input (2) for concentrate and a recirculation circuit (15) connectable to said input for chemical and/or heat sterilisation and/or other cleansing of at least the liquid preparation circuit of the control monitor. The system is characterized by a cleansing chamber (10, 10') connectable to the recirculation circuit (15), which chamber is arranged to be able to receive a concentrate suction pipe (5) which is disconnectable from the monitor (1) so that said pipe may be flushed. The invention also relates to a method for sterilizing a concentrate suction pipe (5) forming a part of the above mentioned system. The invention further includes a cleansing chamber (10) intended to be included in the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for preparation
of a medical solution, such as for dialysis, comprising a
preferably conventional control monitor with an input for
concentrate and a recirculation circuit connectable to said
input for chemical and/or heat sterilisation and/or other
cleansing of at least the liquid preparation circuit of the
control monitor.The apparatus is primarily intended for dialysis, though it is
also suitable for many other purposes, for example for
preparation of replacement liquid for hemodiafiltration and
hemofiltration.The invention also relates to a method for sterilising a
concentrate suction pipe forming a part of the above
mentioned apparatus, as well as a cleansing chamber belonging
to the same apparatus.American Patents 4 158 034 and 4 293 409 describe a system
for chemical sterilisation of a dialysis monitor including
a recirculation circuit, such that components upstream of
the inlet for the sterilisation fluid can also be sterilized.
In the known monitor, sterilisation fluid is drawn
from a reservoir with the help of a pipe which is also used
for sucking up a concentrate during preparation of dialysis 
fluid. The same system can also be heat sterilized. Thus, the
pipe is instead placed in the heat chamber arranged at the
start of the system.In American Patent 4 728 496 the system for a dialysis monitor
arranged for heat sterilisation is shown schematically. This
system too includes a recirculation circuit which comprises
substantially all the components in the monitor before the
dialyser as well as a by-pass conduit for closing the circuit.
No concentrate suction pipe is shown. In practice however the
system is equipped with such a pipe which also in this case is
inserted into the heat chamber at the start of the system for
sterilization.More recently use is being made of a removable concentrate
suction pipe which is connected to the monitor via a connector
on the monitor when concentrate is to be taken from a substantially
rigid container or reservoir. Alternatively the same
connector can be connected to a flexible bag containing concentrate.
With such a system it has been shown to be difficult to
effectively cleanse the concentrate suction pipe. This problem
is solved with the aid of the present invention.The invention thus relates to an apparatus for preparation of a
medical solution, such as for dialysis, comprising a control
monitor with an input for concentrate and a recirulation circuit
connectable to said input for chemical and/or heat

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for preparation of a medical
solution, such as for dialysis, comprising a control

monitor (1) having a liquid preparation circuit with a
concentrate input (2) connected to a preferably dis-connectable

concentrate suction pipe (5); and a
recirculation circuit (15) connectable to said input (2)

for cleansing of at least said liquid preparation circuit
of the control monitor by a cleansing agent for chemical

and/or heat sterilization, 
characterized
 by a cleansing
chamber (10) included in said recirculation circuit (15)

and having a form and size sufficient for receiving said
concentrate suction pipe (5), and being arranged for

passing said cleansing agent through the interior of the
pipe and along its exterior or vice versa for cleansing of

both the interior and exterior of said pipe (5).
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized

by a conduit (3), preferably releasably connected to the
concentrate input (2) terminated by a conduit connector

(4), adapted to be connected to said pipe (5) or a
flexible concentrate bag (6) during normal operation of

the monitor and to an inlet (7) of said recirculation
circuit (15) for completing the recirculation circuit,

during normal cleansing of the monitor.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
