<ABSTRACT>
An insulating unit (150) has a pair of glass sheets (12,14) about an 
edge assembly (152) to provide a compartment (18) between the sheets. 

The edge assembly has a U-shaped spacer (158) made of metal, metal coated 
plastic, gas and moisture impervious polymer, or gas and moisture 

impervious film coated polymer. The outer legs (156) of the spacer (158) 
and the glass (12,14) provide a long diffusion path to limit the 

diffusion of argon gas out of the compartment (18). The edge assembly 
(152) has materials selected and sized to provide edge assembly having 

an RES-value of at least 75.
 

A spacer (158) for use in insulating units includes a plastic core 
having a gas impervious film e.g. a metal film or a halogenated 

polymer film. Also taught herein are techniques for making the unit (150) 
and spacer (158).

 
The unit (150) has a long diffusion path to increase the time 

period in which insulating glass e.g. Argon gas may be retained in 

the compartment (18). The increased RES-value provides a unit (150) that 
has a low thermal conducting edge (152). In this manner heat loss through 

the marginal edge (152) of the unit (150) is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an insulating glazing unit, in particular, to an insulating glazing unit having an edge assembly
to provide the unit with a low thermal conducting edge, i.e. high resistance to heat flow at the edge of the unit.It is well recognized that insulating glazing units reduce heat transfer between the outside and inside of a home
or other structures. A measure of insulating value generally used is the "U-value". The U-value is the measure of heat
in British Thermal Unit (BTU) passing through the unit per hour (Hr) - square foot (Sq.Ft.) - degree Fahrenheit (°F)
As can be appreciated the lower the U-value the better the thermal insulating value of the unit, i.e higher resistance
to heat flow resulting in less heat conducted through the unit.
Another measure of insulating value is the "R-value" which is the inverse of the U-value. Still another measure is the
resistance (RES) to heat flow which is stated in Hr-°F per BTU per inch of perimeter of the unit
In the past the insulating property, e.g. U-value given for an insulating unit was the U-value measured at the center
of the unit. Recently it has been recognized that the U-value of the edge of the unit must be considered separately to
determine the overall thermal performance of the unit. For example, units that have a low center U-value and high
edge U-value during the winter season exhibit no moisture condensation at the center of the unit, but may have condensation
or even a thin line of ice at the edge of the unit near the frame. The condensation or ice at the edge of the
unit indicates that there is heat loss through the unit and/or frame i.e. the edge has a high U-value. As can be appreciated,
when the condensate or water from the melting ice runs down the unit onto wooden frames, the wood, if not
properly cared for, will rot. Also, the larger temperature differences between the warm center and the cold edge can
cause greater edge stress and glass breakage. The U-values of framed and unframed units and methods of determining
same are discussed in more detail in the section entitled "Description of the Invention."Through the years, the design of and construction materials used to fabricate insulating glazing units, and the
frames have improved to provide framed units having low U-values. Several types of units presently available, and
center and edge U-values of selected ones, are considered in the following discussion.Insulating glass edge units which are characterized by (1) the edges of the glass sheets welded together, (2) a

resilient spacer (158) which is made of metal and having a U-shaped
cross sectional configuration with two opposed outer legs

(156) connected by a middle leg (157), wherein the outer legs

(154) securing the glass sheets (12, 14) to the opposed legs (156)
of the spacer (158) respectively and the surface of the middle leg

(175) of spacer (158) facing away from the compartment (18) having
thereon a moisture impervious sealment (155) and providing a gas

diffusion path having a thickness of less than 0.32 cm (0.125
inch) and a length of at least 0.32 cm (0.125 inch) so that the

loss of gas in the compartment (18) is less than 5 % per year
measured according to DIN 52293 and resulting in an RES-value of

at least 10 as determined using the ANSYS program of the edge
assembly (152).
The unit of claim 1 wherein the compartment (18) has an insulating
gas.
The unit of claim 1 wherein at least one glass sheet has an
environmental coating.
The unit of claim 1 wherein the edge assembly (152) further
includes a layer (160) of a moisture pervious material having a 

desiccant (162) therein on at least a portion of the inner facing
surface of said spacer (158).

more glass sheets, each of the sheets separated by an edge

assembly (152) with the edge assemblies and pair of adjacent
sheets joined together to form a long thin diffusion path and each

edge assembly (152) having a high edge assembly RES-value as
determined using the ANSYS program.
