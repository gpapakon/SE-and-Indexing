<ABSTRACT>
A backflow preventor which permits adjustment of the outflow direction is provided. A conduit (228) provides fluid communication between the two valves of the backflow preventor. The conduit (228) can be separated, e.g., by cutting along a groove (316), leaving annular flat regions (312, 314). The annular flats are configured to engage with a coupler to provide leak-free connection between the separated portions of the conduit. The separated portions of the conduit can be rotated to adjust the outflow direction. Preferably, an infinite number of outflow directions are possible, all of which lie in a plane parallel to the inflow direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a backflow preventor
and, in particular, to a preventor with a provision for
adjusting the outlet direction.Check valves are well known for use in assuring
that a flow through a conduit occurs only in a predefined
direction. Check valves are used, for example, in backflow
prevention assemblies to prevent backflow of one fluid body
into another. Backflow prevention is often used in connection
with protecting potable water supplies from contaminants which
could otherwise be introduced into it via back-siphonage or
back-pressure. Many backflow preventors are designed to
accommodate pressure commonly encountered in municipal water
supplies, such as 150 psi (1030 kPa) or more.Several factors are important in designing or
selecting a backflow preventor for a particular use, including
performance (e.g., minimizing pressure drop), serviceability,
and ease and cost of installation.Many backflow preventors are configured such that the
direction of inlet and the direction of outlet flow are
predetermined. In these devices, when it is desired to provide
an outlet flow direction that is different (with respect to the
inlet flow direction) from the predetermined direction,
additional fittings such as elbows, U-joints, L-joints, T-joints
and the like, must be connected. These additional
fittings not only add to the cost of parts, labor and design
involved in installing these devices, but also contribute to 
undesirable pressure loss. These additional fittings further
take up volume and thus are impractical in applications having
close clearances. Such pressure loss can be particularly
troublesome in applications where maintenance of pressure is
important such as in fire protection systems and high rise
buildings.In previous devices, maximizing serviceability has
been incompatible with also maximizing the performance and
installation factors. Thus, in past devices, efforts to
increase the performance and ease of installation has produced
devices with decreased serviceability. Fig. 6 depicts,
schematically, a previous backflow preventor 110 which
attempted to provide ease of serviceability by including both
valves in 112a, 112b in a vertical configuration and a cover
114 which, when removed, permits access to the valves 112a,
112b (e.g., for maintenance purposes) in a vertical direction.
The device shown in Fig. 6, however, provides a less than
optimal performance. This is at least partially because, owing
to the orientation of the valves 112a, 112b with respect to the
inlet opening 116
