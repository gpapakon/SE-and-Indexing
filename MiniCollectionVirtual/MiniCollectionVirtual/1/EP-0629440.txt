<ABSTRACT>
A fluorination catalyst comprising indium, chromium, 
oxygen and fluorine as essential constituent elements 

thereof. The catalyst is prepared by fluorinating a 
catalyst precursor comprising indium and chromium 

elements by bringing it into contact with hydrogen 
fluoride or a fluorine-containing halogenated hydrocarbon 

at a temperature of 300 to 500°C. A halogenated 
hydrocarbon is fluorinated by bringing it into contact 

with hydrogen fluoride in a gaseous phase in the presence 
of the catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluorination
catalyst and a fluorination process. More particularly,
the invention relates to an improved fluorination
catalyst for producing a hydrofluorocarbon (hereinafter
referred to as "HFC") at a high yield and a process for
efficiently producing the HFC with high productivity by
bringing hydrogen fluoride into contact with a
halogenated hydrocarbon in a gaseous phase by using the
fluorination catalyst. The production of the HFC precludes the
possibility of destruction of the ozone layer because it
does not contain chlorine in the molecule,
particularly difluoromethane (hereinafter referred to as
"HFC-32"), 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (hereinafter
referred to as "HFC-134a") and pentafluoroethane
(hereinafter referred to as "HFC-125").Typical industrial production processes for an
HFC, according to the prior art, include a process which
brings a hydrogen-containing halogenated hydrocarbon into
contact with HF and converts halogens other than F to F
(in some cases, by using an unsaturated halogenated
hydrocarbon as a raw material, reactions to add HF and
convert halogens other than F to F may simultaneously
occur), and a process which brings a halogenated
hydrocarbon into contact with H2 and exchanges the
halogens other than F (a part of F, in some cases) with
H. Among these reactions, the fluorination reaction of a
hydrogen-containing halogenated hydrocarbon with HF does
not proceed smoothly in many cases, and the production
quantity of the HFC depends greatly on the catalyst used.A typical example of an unsmooth reaction is 
the synthesizing reaction of HFC-134a by fluorination of
1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (hereinafter referred to
as "HCFC-133a"). This reaction is an endothermic
reaction which is thermodynamically disadvantageous. For
this reason, the reaction is generally carried out by
adding HF in an amount exceeding a stoichiometric amount
to HCFC-133a, and other reaction conditions (pressure,
temperature, space velocity) are chosen to provide a
significant conversion ratio of HCFC-133a. By way of
example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
No. 55-27138 obtains HFC-134a at a yield of 32% using a
compound obtained by treating CrF3·3H2O with air as the
catalyst under a reaction condition where the reaction
pressure is atmospheric pressure, the reaction
temperature is 400°C, the molar ratio of HF to HCFC-133a
(hereinafter called the molar ratio) is 8 and the space
velocity (hereinafter abbreviated to SV) is 550 h-1.
