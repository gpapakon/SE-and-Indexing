<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for identifying and continuously weighing a parcel (1) having a label (5) with a barcode (6), comprising a series of at least three endless conveyors (10,20,70), characterised:   - in that in the vicinity of the gap (I) between the first (10) and the second (20) conveyor the apparatus has:   . a first set of cells (60,61,62) located in a plane parallel with the plane of advance of the parcel,   . a second set (65,66,67) orthogonal to the first,   - in that the weighing platform (30) weighs the parcel (1) at speed as it advances onto the second conveyor (20) and sends this information to the processing unit (44); - in that the second (20) and the third (70) conveyors are driven continuously and synchronously.

Improved machine for the continuous identification
and weighing of a package (1) whose label (5)

carries a bar code module (6), comprising:

a succession of at least three endless conveyors
(10, 20, 70) driven by motors (14, 28, 74), as

follows:

a first driven conveyor (10) on which the
packages are deposited for identification

and weighing,
a second conveyor (20) connected to the
pan of a balance (30) for measuring the

weight of the package laid on this second
conveyor (20),
and a third conveyor (70) for removing
the identified and weighed package,
a bar code read head (40) located above the head
end (13) of the first conveyor (10) and the tail

end (24) of the second conveyor (20), the said
read head (40) sending the information read from

the label (5) to an electronic processing and
control unit (44) which is also connected to the

balance (30);
and a plurality of cells (60-67, 80) connected to
the processing and control unit (44) for

detecting the presence or passage of the package
that is to be identified,

characterized:

in that it comprises in the vicinity of the gap
(I) between the first conveyor (10) and the second (20):


a first group of cells (60, 61, 62)
arranged in a plane parallel to the plane

of advance of the package, for
determining the width and length of the

package and stopping the first conveyor
(10) when the package has completed its

passage through the beam emitted by this
group of cells (60, 61, 62), so that 

there is only one package at a time on
the second conveyor (20),

and a second group (65, 66, 67) at right
angles to the first, for determining the

height of the package,

and for sending all this information to the processing
unit (44);
in that the pan of the balance (30) measures the
weight of the package (1) without interrupting its motion

as it advances on the second conveyor (20) and sends this
information to the processing unit (44);
and in that the second (20) and third (70)
conveyors are driven permanently and synchronized with

each other.
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the second group for determining the height of the

package includes one cell (65) arranged in parallel with
the cells (60, 61, 62) in order to stop the conveyor (10)

when the package (1) has completed its passage through
the beam of the cells.
Machine according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the head (73) of the third conveyor (70) comprises

a cell (80), whose beam is parallel to the plane (71) of
the third conveyor (70), and whose purpose is to detect

blockages at the head (73) of the third conveyor (70) and
supply this information to the processing unit (44) so

that the output conveyor (20) is stopped.
Machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the processing unit (44) stops the

machine when the label is misread or when the weight of
the package is poorly defined.
