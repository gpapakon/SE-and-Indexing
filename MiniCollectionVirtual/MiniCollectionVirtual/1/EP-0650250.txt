<ABSTRACT>
A converter employs a comparator (C3) sensing the current through an 
output diode (D), for generating a confirmation signal of an OFF state 

of the switch (M1) until the discharge current of the inductor (L) 
toward the user circuit and the external filter capacitance (C) has 

become null, thus ensuring the operation in a discontinuous mode under 
any condition. A turn-off signal of the switch (M1) is provided by 

another comparator (C2) which, instead of the voltage on a sensing 
resistance connected in series with the switch, may sense the voltage 

across the switch (M1) itself. This latter embodiment is particularly 
suited in case of an output MOS transistor and the circuit comprises 

means for masking for a preset period of time the turn-off signal 
produced by said comparator (C2), in order to allow a predefined turn-on 

phase of the switch. Enabling of the turn-on of the switch (M1) is 
conventionally provided by a dedicated (third) comparator (C1) of the 

output voltage. The circuit does not require the use of an error 
amplifier, for the compensation of which special complex integratable 

circuits or alternatively access to the output node of the error 
amplifier through a dedicated pin may be needed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DC-to-DC static
converter, operating in a discontinuous mode,
particularly suited to be integrated in a multisystem
chip.In electronic systems it is often necessary to make
available a stabilized DC voltage of a higher value
than the DC voltage (VCC) available on the supply bus,
whether stabilized or not. A particular voltage
boosting converter circuit is employed for this
purpose, the power circuit of which comprises an
inductor connected to the DC supply bus and driven by a
low-side driver (switch) to cyclically charge, a
recirculation diode for discharging the energy stored
in the inductor during a cyclic connection to ground
through the switch and a filter capacitor connected
between output node and ground. Control and regulation
of the voltage on the output node is implemented by a
control circuit that controls the turn-on and the turn-off
of the switch.In other applications, it may be necessary to make
available a stabilized DC voltage lower than a
stabilized or unstabilized DC voltage present on a
power supply line. In this case, a step-down DC-to-DC
converter, for example a so-called buck converter is
used. The literature on these converter circuits is
conspicuous and well known. The volume "Switch Mode
Power Supply Handbook" by Keith Billings contains a
broad review of these circuits under chapter 20,
entitled "DC-to-DC Switching Regulators", the content 
of which is herein incorporated by express reference.The control system of these converter circuits may
be based upon the regulation of the duty-cycle of the
switchings of the power switch which is driven at a
timing frequency established by a local oscillator or
derived from a general system's clock frequency (that
is a PWM control system) or hysteretically in function
of the output voltage. The mode of operation of the
converter may also be continuous or discontinuous. In a
continuous mode of operation, the inductor is always
crossed by an electric current, that is the switch
commutes again before the discharge current of the
inductance toward the user circuit, through the
discharge (recirculation) diode, becomes null.
Viceversa, in case of a discontinuous mode of
operation, the switch is caused again only after the
discharge current of the inductance has become null.Commonly, the continuous mode of operation is
preferred for relatively high power systems or when it
is important to minimize the residual "ripple" on the
stabilized output voltage and to keep the intensity of
electromagnetic disturbances
