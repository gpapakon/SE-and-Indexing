<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a domestic appliance with a cabinet enclosure, at the bottom of which is arranged a trough-shaped plinth (17) which serves to receive appliance units and also, where appropriate, control and safety equipment and which at least on two opposite sides is recessed with respect to the lateral boundary surfaces of the enclosure, bearring surfaces (22) being formed by the recess which are able, where appropriate, to rest on supports assigned to them, such as frame parts of a niche base, the plinth is designed as a constructional unit which carries the enclosure, is independent, is self-supporting, receives the appliance units in it, permits their functional connections for operation of the appliance, bears the separately mountable appliance enclosure and the bearing properties of which are achieved... continuously constructed mechanical reinforcements extending transversely over the supports, the side walls connected thereto and the bottom of the trough.

Household appliance with a cupboard-shaped housing (16), at the base (18) of which a 
trough-shaped pedestal (17) for reception of apparatus units as well as in a given case of 

control and safety equipments is arranged and is recessed at least at two opposite sides 
with respect to the lateral boundary surfaces of the housing, wherein support surfaces (22) 

are formed by the recessing and are in a given case able to rest on supports associated 
therewith, such as frame parts of a niche base, characterised in that the pedestal (17) is 

executed as an independent, self-supporting constructional unit, which receives the 
apparatus units in themselves, allows their functional connections for the operation of the 

apparatus (15), supports the separate apparatus housing (16) able to be placed on, and 
the load-bearing property of which is achieved by continuously constructed mechanical 

reinforcements which extend on transversely over the support surfaces (22), the side walls 
(19) connected therewith and the base (18) of the trough. 
Household appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the mechanical 
reinforcements are constructed as reinforcing ribs (24) which extend closely parallel to one 

another are arranged substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal extent of the support 
surfaces (22) and are provided exclusively on the surfaces, which face the trough space, 

of the side walls (19) and the base (18) of the trough as well as the support surfaces (22). 
Household appliance according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the 
reinforcing ribs (24) are constructed as hollow profile members produced together with the 

trough walls. 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised thereby that the 
hollow profile members have rectangular cross-section, wherein the cross-sectional sides 

arranged perpendicularly on the surfaces of the trough walls are constructed to be 
elevated in the region of the transition of the side walls (19) to the support surfaces (22). 
Household appliance according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the reinforcing 
ribs (24) are constructed in cross-section as U-shaped profile members, the limbs of which 

and the base of which are arranged on the surfaces, which face the trough space, of the 
side walls (19) and the base (18) of the trough as well as the support surfaces (22).  

 
Household appliance according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the limbs of the 
reinforcing ribs (24), which are U-shaped in cross-section, are constructed to be elevated 

in the region of the transition of the side walls (19) to the support surfaces (22). 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby that the 
apparatus units in the pedestal (17) are arranged at least in the proximity of the reinforcing 

ribs (24). 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby that the 
trough-shaped pedestal (17) has a base surface with each time two circumferential sides 

which extend parallel to one another and which include in pairs an intermediate angle of 
90Â° between one another. 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised thereby that the 
support surfaces (22) are provided with means (25), which have a centring and 

receptacles which ensure a releasable retention of the housing base, which is equipped 
with corresponding counter means and serves as support surface, of the apparatus (15). 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised thereby that 
furniture feet, which project beyond the base (18) of the pedestal (17), are detachably 

insertable into the support surfaces (22). 
Household appliance according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised thereby that 
the appliance is a refrigerator or freezer, of which cooling units, such as compressor, 

condenser, ventilating unit and the catch container for thaw water, belonging to a cooling 
system, are arranged in the pedestal (17).
