<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the control of the flow of refrigerant in a refrigeration 
or air conditioning system and particularly relates to control of refrigerant flow in mobile air 
conditioning systems of the type employed for cooling the passenger compartment in a 
vehicle. Heretofore, it has been common practice to employ a temperature responsive 
expansion valve for controlling flow of refrigerant to the endothermic heat exchanger or 
evaporator in the refrigeration or air conditioning system, which valve employed a fluid filled 
control chamber responsive to evaporator discharge temperature to create pressure on a 
diaphragm connected to operate a moveable valve member for controlling flow to the 
evaporator inlet. Such temperature responsive valves are commonly referred to as 
thermostatic expansion valves and have enjoyed widespread use in high volume production 
of passenger automobiles because of the relative low cost of manufacturing of such valves. 
However, such thermostatic expansion valves do require that the temperature sensing fluid 
chamber be hermetically sealed with the sensing fluid and thus have been prone to 
developing leakage in the sensing chamber over prolonged service. Although temperature responsive thermostatic expansion valves have proven 
generally satisfactory for controlling refrigerant flow to the evaporator, such a device has the 
disadvantage that it can only react to the result of a change in ambient conditions or thermal 
load on the evaporator for control purposes; and, therefore control of the refrigerant flow lags 
the need for change. Thus, it has been desired to provide an electrically controlled expansion 
valve which can be controlled by a signal generating circuit which employs a "smart" control 
signal developed by a microcomputer receiving inputs from sensors identifying the changes 
in ambient conditions. Such an arrangement with an electrically controlled expansion valve 
can thus be designed to anticipate the need for change in refrigerant flow responsive to 
extreme or rapid changes in ambient conditions or thermal load on the evaporator. The 
problem of providing refrigerant flow control in a passenger vehicle air conditioning system 
in response to extreme or rapid change of ambient conditions or thermal load on the  
 
evaporator is particularly complicated or aggravated by the rapid changes in the speed of the 
compressor which is normally driven by a belt connected to the vehicle engine power shaft. 
Thus, in extreme conditions of sun load
