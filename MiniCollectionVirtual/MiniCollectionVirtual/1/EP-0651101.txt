<ABSTRACT>
The object is to provide a connector (1), a connector 
unit, and a connected connector unit made by connecting 

together the connector units; all capable of providing 
versatility in size and strength, facilitating low cost jig 

fabrication and well-suited for mass production, by using a 
tubular member of a multiple layer structure made by 

laminating two or more different materials selected from 
the group consisting of metal, plastic, ceramic, wood or 

the like. 
The device comprises; a hollow tubular member (2) of a 
multiple layer structure made by laminating two or more 

materials, and open on at least one end thereof, an 
adhesive injection portion formed to make connection 

between the end or side and the hollow part (7) of the 
tubular member (2); an engage part (9) for a branch pipe formed 

in the adhesive injection portion; and a hollow branch pipe 
(10) with its one end provided with an engage part (12) capable 

of attaching or detaching from the engage part (9) for the 
branch pipe (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector for joining 
members of a same material of wood, laminated wood or 
stone, or for joining a member of wood or laminated wood 
with a member of stone or concrete, and more specifically 
relates to a connector used in furniture or wooden 
dwellings or for joining structural members with joints and 
couplings in constructions having frames in large stud 
partition constructions using heavy timbers. In recent years, connectors for joining beams and pole 
plates, pole plates and columns, girt and independent 
columns for reducing labor time in the construction of 
houses have been developed along with joints and couplings 
for streamlining the work process. For instance, Japanese U.M. Laid-open No. Sho 63-162008 
shows framing fixtures used for stud partition frame 
working methods, Japanese U.M. Laid-open No. Hei 2-93401 
shows reinforcement fixtures for joints at the bottom ends 
of columns and the foundations in frame type stud  
 
partitions Japanese Patent Laid-open No. Hei 3-295946 shows 
protruding dowel fixtures and stud frame partitions in 
lower wall structures using the dowel fixtures, Japanese 
Patent Laid-open No. Hei 2-300442 shows connecting 
structures for wood type structure materials with a stud 
frame partition that is not dismantled after connection. 
These inventions all use metal fixtures, or nuts or bolts 
to connect the structural materials. Additionally as joint structures, Japanese Patent 
Laid-open Nos. Sho 63-14939, 63-14940 and 63-14941 show 
joints providing improved structural strength in stud frame 
partitions. However these conventional connectors and joints all 
require a large number of metal bolts, nuts and washers, 
making installation difficult during the work process. 
Another drawback is these metal parts are difficult to 
carry on the job because of their large size and weight and 
further represent a safety hazard in work done at locations 
high above ground. Besides the extra work needed to correct mistakes in 
installation of fixtures, there is the drawback that 
installations embedded at specific positions drilled for 
placing of cylinders and plugs, and the threading of bolts 
in holes in the embedded cylinders and plugs is very 
troublesome work requiring a large amount of man-hours and 
delaying building construction schedules. Wood pieces joined by items like bolts or nuts have 
the drawback of loss of mechanical strength since the wood  
 
material is prone to loose its tightness and become loose 
when the wood material
