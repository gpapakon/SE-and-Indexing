<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are anthracycline antibiotics of a formula (I): 

wherein R¹ und R² are hydroxyl groups, R³ is ethyl group, R⁴ is 
hydroxyl group, X is daunosamine-rhodinose or daunosamine-deoxyfucose, 

N-monomethyldaunosamine-rhodinose, N-monomethyl-daunosamine-deoxyfucose, 
as well as pharmaceutically acceptable acid 

addition salts thereof. The antibiotics (I) have a carcinostatic 
activity and are useful as a carcinostatic.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a divisional application of European 
Patent No. 0 311 054 (88 116 500.5).
 
The parent application concerns anthracycline antibiotics 
of formula (I) 
wherein R¹ is hydroxyl group, methoxy group, 
R²is hydroxyl group R³is ethyl group, R⁴is methoxycarbonyl group, Xis daunosamine-rhodinose or daunosamine-deoxyfucose,  
with the proviso that when R¹ and R² are hydroxyl 
groups, R³ is ethyl group, R⁴ is methoxycarbonyl 
group, then X represents daunosamine-rhodinose or 
daunosamine-deoxyfucose; or
 
when R¹ is methoxy group, R² is hydroxyl group, R³ 
is ethyl group, R⁴ is methoxycarbonyl group, then X 
represents daunosamine-rhodinose or 
daunosamine-deoxyfucose;
 
as well as pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts 
thereof. Furthermore, the parent application concerns a method for 
preparing an anthracycline antibiotic of the above formula, 
(I) as well as a carcinostatic. The present divisional application concerns anthracycline 
antibiotics being daunosamine derivatives with R⁴ from 
formula (I) being a hydroxyl group as well as a process for 
preparing the same and products containing said 
antibiotics.  As carcinostatic anthracycline antibiotics, 
hithereto, daunomycin (refer to U. S. Patent 3,616,242) 
and adriamycin (refer to U. S. Patent 3,590,028) are 
known, and these two are compounds which are most widely 
utilized for clinical use at present as a carcinostatic 
chemotherapeutical agent. However, these have serious 
cardiotoxic activity and myelotoxic activity, even 
though they have an excellent carcinostatic activity. 
Therefore, these are not absolutely satisfactory as 
carcinostatic agents. Under the circumstances, 
production of compounds whose harmful side effect is 
reduced and whose carcinostatic activity is improved is 
desired, and some anthracycline antibiotics have already 
been proposed to be produced by means of a fermentation 
method, microbial conversion method and chemical 
synthesis method. For instance, specific examples of 
known antibiotics include aclacinomycin A and 
aclacinamycin B (refer to JP-B-51-34914 - the term "JP-B" 
as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent 
publication"), rhodomycin antibiotics (refer to JP-A-56-15299  
 
- the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"), 4'-O-tetrahydropyranyl-adriamycin 
(refer to JP-B-57-13558), 
3'-deamino-3'-morpholino-daunomycin and 3'-deamino-3'-morpholino-adriamycin 
(refer to JP-A-57-163393). 
Other daunomycin and adriamycin derivatives 
are
