<ABSTRACT>
A downhole safety valve for retrofitting to a well 
comprises an annular member (4) to be built into the 

wellhead, a closure valve (28) to be set in a tubing string 
(27) just below the wellhead, and a piston (15) 

reciprocatable in the annular member and having a depending 
rigid tubular stinger (26) for operating the valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
Wells in gas and oil fields are usually built with 
downhole safety valves, sometimes referred to as sub-surface 
safety valves, which close to contain the well 
pressure in emergency situations. Such valves may be 
constructed as flapper or ball valves and are usually held 
open against normal well pressure by hydraulic pressure 
applied down from the surface through a control line. Such 
control lines are vulnerable and liable to damage which can 
result in complicated and lengthy workover situations. The present invention is concerned with the 
retrofitting of a well with a downhole safety valve. 
Conventionally this has involved installing at the wellhead 
an intermediate flange and a piggy back hanger either to 
give the facility of installing a control line or to create 
an annulus down which control fluid can be pumped to supply 
pressure to a downhole safety valve. However, these 
solutions involve the killing of the well and pulling of 
the completion in order to install the valve, and still 
result in the need to provide for the feeding of control 
fluid down the well to operate the valve. The inventors have now appreciated that the above 
problems can be overcome by setting a downhole closure 
valve a short distance, say between 2 and 15, preferably 
between 3 and 10 and most preferably substantially 5 metres 
below the wellhead, and to operate the valve by means of a 
piston in the wellhead which is coupled directly and 
mechanically to the valve by a stinger, preferably rigid 
with the piston. Accordingly, in accordance with the present invention, 
a downhole valve assembly for a well comprises a closure 
valve which is, or is arranged to be, secured within tubing 
in a completed well; an annular member which is, or is 
arranged to be, built into a wellhead; a piston which is 
axially slidable within the annular member; means for 
displacing the piston axially within the annular member;  
 
and a stinger depending from the piston down to the valve 
to operate the valve upon axial movement of the piston. The piston may be subjected to a variety of forces to 
provide the valve control. Thus the displacement means may 
comprise at least one fluid space to which fluid under 
pressure can be applied through a gallery in the annular 
member to urge the piston in a respective axial direction. 
The fluid under pressure applied to one fluid space may 
then be arranged to hold the piston and stinger against the 
action of a spring in a position in which the valve is held 
open; the spring providing a

A downhole valve assembly for a well, the assembly 
comprising a closure valve (28) which is, or is arranged to 

be, secured within tubing (27) in a completed well; an 
annular member (4) which is, or is arranged to be, built 

into a wellhead; a piston (15) which is axially slidable 
within the annular member; means (22,23,38,40;49,54) for 

displacing the piston axially within the annular member; 
and a stinger (26) depending from the piston down to the 

valve to operate the valve upon axial movement of the 
piston. 
An assembly according to claim 1, wherein the 
displacement means comprises at least one fluid space 

(22,23;40;49,54) to which fluid under pressure can be 
applied through a gallery (11,13;41;53) in the annular 

member (4) to urge the piston (15) in a respective axial 
direction. 
An assembly according to claim 2, wherein fluid under 
pressure applied to one fluid space (40) is arranged to 

hold the piston (15A) and stinger (26) against the action 
of a spring (38) in a position in which the valve (28) is 

held open; the spring providing a fail safe closing of the 
valve upon reduction in the fluid pressure. 
An assembly according to claim 3, wherein the fluid 
pressure is provided by an accumulator (39) secured within 

the annular member (4A) behind a tamper proof cover (44). 
An assembly according to claim 3, wherein one fluid 
under pressure applied to one fluid space (49) is arranged 

to hold the piston (15B) and stinger against the action of 
well pressure applied to another fluid space (54), in a 

position in which the valve is held open; the piston and 
stinger being arranged to be moved by the well pressure 

 
applied to the second fluid space, upon reduction of the 

first fluid pressure, to cause closing of the valve. 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which the stinger (26) is a tube rigid with the 

piston (15). 
An assembly according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which the stinger is between 3 and 10 metres 

long. 
A method of retrofitting a completed well with a 
downhole safety valve, without pulling the completion, the 

method comprising plugging the tubing (27) to seal the 
well, fitting the wellhead with an additional annular 

member (4), unplugging the tubing, running in and securing 
a downhole pressure valve (28) within the tubing, and 

running into the annular member a piston (15) having a 
depending stinger (26) which reaches down to the valve 

assembly, the piston being axially movable relatively to 
the annular member to operate the valve via the stinger.
