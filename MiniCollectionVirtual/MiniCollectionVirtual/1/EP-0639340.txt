<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to a device for 
selective separation of toothbrush bristles that allows 

the toothbrush bristles to be cut into different 
lengths and profiles in different selected areas. 

According to this invention, the device for selective 
separation of toothbrush bristles comprises a base (1) 

with fixation means (2) for a toothbrush (3) having 
bristles (20), and a support (6) assembled over the 

base (1), wherein the support (6) comprises a pair of 
simetrically pivoting stems (7) over a first geometric 

plane, the support (6) being displaceable over a 
portion of the base (1) along a geometric axle that is 

parallel to said first geometric plane, from a resting 
position to a position of contact betweent the stems 

(7) and said bristles and a cam means (4) cooperating 
with the respective portions of the stems (7), during 

at least part of said displacement of the support (6)  
 

over the base (1), in order to cause the simetrically 
pivoting movement of the stems (7). Additionally, this 

invention refers to a device for selective cutting of 
toothbrush bristles comprising the above mentioned 

device for selective separation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a separation device for
selective separation of toothbrush bristles,
which comprises a base with fixation means
for a toothbrush and a support assembled over the base.
The separation device can additionally comprise a bristles cutting
roller for selective cutting of toothbrush bristles.A layout today frequently found in
toothbrushes is that in which the toothbrush bristles
have different lengths, some of them longer and other
shorter, having for objective to provide an efficient
and healthy cleaning of the user's teeth.Document EP 0.458.999 discloses a device to
cut toothbrush bristles into different sizes in
different selected areas, comprising a support to fix
the toothbrush head and at least a protecting plate 
associated to a determined area of the toothbrush
bristles and mobile between a resting position far from
the head and the bristles end, and an active position,
near to the head. The protecting plate is provided with
board means to couple the bristle ends in the selected
area and to provide a radial component of movement to
the coupled bristle ends, folding the corresponding
bristles to far from the bristles located outside the
selected area, through the movement of said board in
axial direction, from upward to downward, from a
resting position to an active position.This device is applicable in the separation
of bristles of toothbrushes having any head shape
whatsoever. However, for such purpose, the protecting
plates should have different shapes, each of them being
specifically applicable to a cutting standard to be
effected in a determined toothbrush head shape.
Additionally, depending on the desired cutting standard
and the toothbrush head shape, the plates may have a
quite complex configuration, it being difficult to
model them and thus requiring high manufacturing costs.Another provision usually employed for the
selective cutting of toothbrush bristles (see for example EP-A-0 078 569)
comprises a base with fixation means for a toothbrush and a mobile 
support over the base, the support comprising also a
pair of stems which are fixedly assembled in the
support and which advance in perpendicular direction
towards the toothbrush bristles when the support is
moved over the base.This device has the disadvantage that the
stems are able to separate only bristle tufts which are
aligned in a parallel line to the toothbrush
longitudinal axle. Particularly in the case of the
toothbrush with triangular head or snake head, the
bristle tufts are irregularly cut, once the tufts
