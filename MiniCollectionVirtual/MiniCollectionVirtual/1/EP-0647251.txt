<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to surface
mount conductive adhesive composition. In
particular, the present invention relates to
particular mixtures of finely divided silver
particles, an acrylated urethane resin or an acrylic
resin, an acrylate monomer, and free radical
initiator useful as surface mount conductive
adhesive compositions for bonding electrical
components onto flexible circuitry such as membrane
switches.Existing commercially available surface mount
conductive adhesives are typically made from
mixtures of epoxy resins, epoxy curatives, solvent
and silver. When cured, these materials tend to be
very brittle or exhibit a high modulus of
elasticity. For printed wiring board (PWB)
applications, since the substrate is rigid, such
high modulus adhesives produce acceptable bonding
between the electrical component and the substrate.
However, for flexible circuits such as membrane
switches, high modulus surface mount conductive
adhesives may not be suitable because of cracking
and loss of adhesion during flexing.It has also been observed that epoxy based
adhesives show podr compatibility with polymer thick
film substrates based on vinyl resins in that during
the curing step, the epoxy system reacts with the
resin resulting in severe discoloration and loss in
adhesion.G.P. Nguyen, J.R. Williams, and Fredrick W.
Gibson, "Conductive Adhesives", Circuits Assembly
January 1993, pages 36-38 and 41 discuss the general
expected properties of surface mount conductive
adhesives for several applications.JP-A-2202959 describes an anti static coating 
composition comprising 2 to 300 parts by weight of
conductive filler (e.g. conductive carbon) homogeneously
dispersed in 100 parts by weight of curable composition
which comprises at least one radical-curable oligomer
which is an unsaturated polyester, epoxy acrylate,
urethane acrylate or polyene polythiol and, if necessary,
200 parts by weight or less (based on 100 parts by weight
of said oligomer) of a polymerisable(meth)acrylic monomer
(e.g. trimethylol propane triacrylate). Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention
is directed to a surface mount conductive adhesive
comprising:
(a) 2 to 15 parts by weight of a
binder resin selected from the group consisting
of acrylated urethane resins, acrylic resin, and
mixtures thereof; (b) 2 to 15 parts by weight of an
acrylate monomer;(c) 0.01 to 3 parts by weight of a
free radical initiator; and(d) 72 to 95 parts by weight of
finely divided silver particles.Another aspect of the present invention is
