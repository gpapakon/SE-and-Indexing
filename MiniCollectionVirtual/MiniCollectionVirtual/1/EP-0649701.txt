<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a wedge (20) which presses the wire (22) against a contact surface (14 or 16) and can be excited ultrasonically. For this purpose, the wedge (20) is arranged on a bonding head (12) which can be moved up and down (z-axis) perpendicularly to the contact surface (14 or 16), the contact surface (14 or 16) being located on a base (18) movable approximately transversely to the direction of movement (z-axis) of the bonding head (12) while the contact surface (14 or 16) is positioned opposite the wedge (20). The device also comprises a means of controlling a drive for the bonding head (12). The wedge (20) is mounted on the bonding head (12) in such a way as to be linearly displaceable parallel to the direction of movement (z-axis) of the bonding head (12).
