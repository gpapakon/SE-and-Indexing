<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stable
lyophilized composition of the antitumor alkylating
agent (N,N',N''-triethylene-thiophosphoramide) and a method
of preparing such a composition via co-lyophilization
of the active ingredient with a pharmaceutically
acceptable alkalizing agent.Thiotepa is an ethylenimine type compound,
also referred to as 1,1',1''-phosphinothioylidynetris-aziridine
which has the following structure:

It is a polyfunctional alkylating agent used in the
chemotherapy of various neoplastic diseases including
adenocarcinoma of the breast and ovaries and for the
treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the
urinary bladder. Preparation of the compound is
reported in U.S. Patent 2,670,347 and U.S. Patent
4,918,199.At present, thiotepa is commercially provided
in a pharmaceutical dosage form for parenteral use as a
sterile powder for reconstitution containing a mixture 
of thiotepa powder, sodium chloride and sodium
bicarbonate. When reconstituted with Sterile Water for
Injection, the resulting solution has a pH of about
7.6. Whether in its original powder form or
reconstituted, it must be stored under refrigerated
conditions (2-8oC). The reconstituted solution is only
stable for about 5 days as a reconstituted solution,
even under refrigerated conditions.The thiotepa sterile powder is known to
degrade rapidly to a hazy solution upon reconstitution
with aqueous media. It is theorized that the haze is
due to a polymerization reaction which occurs when the
compound is exposed to water. It is known that as
thiotepa bulk degrades, water is consumed, and a
decrease of water content can be detected. It has also
been reported that the solution is more stable at an
alkaline pH.Several attempts have been made to stabilize
the thiotepa composition and slow down or prevent the
haze formation that occurs in aqueous media. Sodium
bicarbonate was added to the powder formulation as a
stabilizer based on the theory that the presence of the
bicarbonate would render the environment of the powder
alkaline and stabilize the thiotepa via a pH mechanism.
However, contrary to this theory, the data indicated
that the presence of sodium bicarbonate in the sterile
powder did not stabilize thiotepa and prevent the rapid
haze formation.Thus, there is a need for a formulation of
thiotepa which has improved stability and which does
not undergo such rapid haze formation upon
reconstitution with aqueous media.It is known in the art that freeze-drying
(lyophilization) of a product which is relatively
unstable in

parenteral administration preparable by the process which

comprises:

(a) preparing an aqueous solution of
thiotepa;

non-electrolyte bulking agent is selected from mannitol

and dextrose.
