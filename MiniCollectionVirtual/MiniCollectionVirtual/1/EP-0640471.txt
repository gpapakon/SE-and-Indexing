<ABSTRACT>
A basket liner constructed from a preformed sheet of 
material, the basket liner having an upper end, a lower end, an 

opening in the upper end forming an inner surface, and an outer 
periphery forming an outer surface, a bonding material disposed 

on a portion of the outer surface of the basket liner, the 
basket, or both, for bondingly connecting the basket liner to

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to basket liners and, 
more particularly, to basket liners having a bonding material 
thereon, and methods of using same. In one aspect the present invention is an article 
comprising a basket liner, made by forming at least one sheet of 
material into a predetermined shape for both lining a basket and 
receiving an object, wherein the basket liner comprises: a base 
having a closed lower end and an open upper end and an outer 
periphery forming an outer surface, the open upper end 
intersected by an object opening extending therethrough, said 
object opening forming an inner surface, a bonding material 
disposed upon a portion of the outer surface, wherein the sheet 
of material is selected from the group consisting of a 
relatively thin polymer film, a relatively thin foil, and 
combinations thereof, the sheet of material which normally is 
flexible and substantially non-shape-sustaining, wherein the 
formed basket liner is flexible and may be substantially 
flattened and then unflattened to assume the original shape of 
the formed basket liner without substantial loss of the 
preformed shape thereby providing the flexible yet shape-sustaining 
nature of the formed basket liner, wherein the 
forming of the sheet is accomplished by substantially 
permanently fixing a portion of the sheet into a plurality of 
overlapping folds to form the base of the basket liner and for 
cooperating to retain the basket liner in the formed shape, and 
wherein the sheet of material preferably has a thickness of less 
than about 1.5 mil. In another aspect the present invention is a basket 
liner assembly, comprising: a basket; and a basket liner, made 
by forming at least one sheet of material into a predetermined 
shape for both lining a basket and receiving an object, wherein  
 
the basket liner comprises a base having a closed lower end and 
an open upper end and an outer periphery forming an outer 
surface, the open upper end intersected by an object opening 
extending therethrough, said object opening forming an inner 
surface, a bonding material disposed upon a portion of the outer 
surface, wherein the sheet of material is selected from the 
group consisting of a relatively thin polymer film, a relatively 
thin foil, and combinations thereof, the sheet of material which 
normally is flexible and substantially non-shape-sustaining, 
wherein the formed basket liner is flexible and may be 
substantially flattened and then unflattened to assume the 
original shape of the formed basket

forming at least one sheet of material into a predetermined 

shape for both lining a basket and receiving an object, wherein 
the basket liner comprises: 

   a base having a closed lower end and an open 
upper end and an outer periphery forming an outer surface, the 

open upper end intersected by an object opening extending 
therethrough, said object opening forming an inner surface, a 

bonding material disposed upon a portion of the outer surface, 
   wherein the sheet of material is selected from 

the group consisting of a relatively thin polymer film, a 
relatively thin foil, and combinations thereof, the sheet of 

material which normally is flexible and substantially non-shape-sustaining, 
   wherein the formed basket liner is flexible and 

may be substantially flattened and then unflattened to assume

substantial loss of the preformed shape thereby providing the 
flexible yet shape-sustaining nature of the formed basket liner, 

   wherein the forming of the sheet is accomplished 
by substantially permanently fixing a portion of the sheet into 

a plurality of overlapping folds to form the base of the basket 
liner and for cooperating to retain the basket liner in the 

formed shape, and 
   wherein the sheet of material has a thickness of 

less than about 1.5 mil. 
The basket liner of Claim 1 wherein the basket 
liner has a decorative border extending outwardly from the open 

upper end of the base. 
The article of Claim 2 wherein the decorative 
border is substantially free of substantially permanently fixed 

overlapping folds. 
The basket liner of Claim 1 wherein a substantial 
portion of the overlapping folds extend over different distances 

and at various and arbitrary angles. 
A basket liner assembly, comprising: 
   a basket; and 

   a basket liner, made by forming at least one 
sheet of material into a predetermined shape for both lining a 

basket and receiving an object, wherein the basket liner 
comprises: 

   a base having a closed lower end and an open 
upper end and an outer periphery forming an outer surface , the 

open upper end intersected by an object opening extending 
therethrough, said object opening forming an inner surface, a 

bonding material disposed upon a portion of the outer surface, 
   wherein the sheet of material is selected 

from the group consisting of a relatively thin polymer film, a 
relatively thin foil, and combinations thereof, the sheet of 

material which normally is flexible and substantially non-shape-sustaining, 
   wherein the formed basket liner is flexible 

and may be substantially flattened and then unflattened to 
assume the original shape of the formed basket liner without 

substantial loss of the preformed shape thereby providing the 
flexible yet shape-sustaining nature of the formed basket liner, 

   wherein the forming of the sheet is 
accomplished by substantially permanently fixing a portion of 

the sheet into a plurality of overlapping folds to form the base
