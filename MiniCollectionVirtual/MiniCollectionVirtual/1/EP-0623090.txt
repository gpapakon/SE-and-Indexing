<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a winding process in which the thread end is secured to the surface of the spool at the end of the spool travel in such a way that, when the spool is subsequently handled and transported, none of the layers of thread can slip off. According to the invention, the threads (1) fed on at the end of the spool travel are taken out of the thread changer (2) and taken into a narrow axial longitudinal region of the spool (8) and wound on. When the spool (8) is taken off, a pressure device (12-14) is pivoted against the surface of the spool and presses the end of the thread into the thread roll thus formed with adjustable force.
