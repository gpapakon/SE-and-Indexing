<ABSTRACT>
An active metal non-aqueous electrochemical cell includes an 
anode selected from lithium metal and intercalated lithium 

compounds, an electrolyte system consisting essentially of an SO₂ 
solvent containing an amount of electrolyte salt, and a solid 

liquid or gaseous cathode active material selected from a class of 
materials which are reduced in preference to SO₂, wherein the 

amount of cathode material is generally limiting with respect to 
the desired discharge reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to primary or 
secondary,non-aqueous electrochemical cells or batteries of either 
active or reserve types. More particularly, the invention is 
directed to improvements in the high discharge rate performance of 
such cells including improvements in cell safety based on the use 
of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) as the solvent in an inorganic electrolyte 
combination with liquid or gaseous cathode material such as the 
oxyhalides thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) and sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) 
as the cathode active material. The amount of cathode active 
material in the electrolyte system is usually sufficient only to 
sustain the needed electrochemical reaction, and can be entirely 
consumed during normal discharge of the cell, thereby reducing the 
amount of highly reactive residual components to a safe level. Non-aqueous active metal cells have been in use for some time. 
They have enabled those skilled in the art to achieve much greater 
energy densities or energy to weight ratios than had been possible 
with other electrochemical couples. The wide range of potential 
uses for these cells has led to a great deal of interest in 
improving the performance and safety of the cells so that they may 
be used in a greater number of applications.  Cells of this class normally consist of a light, strongly 
reducing anode, normally an alkali metal such as lithium (Li) or an 
alkaline earth metal such as magnesium (Mg) or calcium (Ca), an 
aprotic, non-aqueous liquid solvent/depolarizer into which an 
appropriate quantity of an electrolyte salt of the anode metal has 
been dissolved to form a conductive electrolyte solution together, 
with an oxidizing agent as the cathode material. Active metal-oxyhalide 
systems, and particularly lithium systems, which include 
an electrolyte salt dissolved in an electrolyte solvent including 
thionyl chloride (SOCl₂) or sulfuryl chloride (SO₂Cl₂) are among the 
highest energy density cells achieved to date by any 
electrochemical power source. It has also been found that the 
discharge rate efficiency of the Li/SOCl₂ or SO₂Cl₂ cells can be 
even further increased by the addition of halogen compounds such as 
bromine (Br₂) and interhalogen compounds such as BrCl, particularly 
in combination with SO₂. In the case of liquid or gaseous cathode reactions, however, 
the oxyhalide materials used are typically very reactive and 
present a cell safety problem particularly when present in an 
abundant quantity, as when they are also used as the electrolyte
