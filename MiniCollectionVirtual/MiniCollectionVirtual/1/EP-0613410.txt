Device for producing inner profiles in a non-cutting operation, in 
a recess of a workpiece, particularly for producing internal threads,
 
   comprising several tool elements for forming the inner profile of 

said workpiece, which, in an initial state, are disposed so as to permit 
their introduction into said workpiece (6), and which arrive in an interlocked 

state, by a radial displacement against said recess of said workpiece, 
so as to join each other continuously,
 
   
characterized
 in that a spreading element (3) is provided which is 
adapted to be centrally introduced between said tool elements in a direction 

orthogonal to the sense of displacement of said tool elements, 
and presses the latter, in the course of such introduction of said 

spreading element, whose outside periphery increases, against the recess 
of said tool by an enforced guiding action and with application of 

force, resulting in a deformation of the internal profile of said workpiece 
when the interlocked state is achieved. 
Device according to Claim 1,
characterized
 in that at least three tool elements are provided. 
Device according to Claim 1,
characterized
 in that said tool comprises at least two leading tool elements 
(1.1) and two trailing tool elements (1.2) which, in an initial 

state, are disposed within the outside profile of said leading tool elements.  
 
Device according to any of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized
 in that said spreading element comprises an extending 
mechanism and a guide for said tool elements. 
Device according to Claim 4,
characterized
 in that said extending mechanism is an extending cam, a 
lever mechanism, or an extending wedge or cone, respectively. 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterized
 in that said guide is an internal guide which permits a linear 
movement or a composite movement composed of several linear 

movements. 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterized
 in that said guide includes radial ball bearings or thrust 
bearings. 
Device according to any of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized
 in that said spreading element includes a resetting mechanism. 
Device according to any of Claims 1 to 8,
characterized
 in that said tool elements have different profiles on their 
engaging surfaces. 
Device according to any of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized
 in that said tool with interlocking tool elements is adapted 
for use also as tool support for subsequent machining operations. 
Device according to any of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized
 in that a counter-element (5) may be used in machining 
thin-walled parts of workpieces (6).  

 
Device according to Claim 1,
characterized
 in that said tool elements (1) comprise cutting edges 
which, in the interlocked state, are arranged so as to join each other 

continuously. 
Device according to Claim 12,
characterized
 in that the number of tool elements is determined by the 
respective polygonal cross-section, with the number of sides or corners, 

respectively, of the polygon corresponding to the respective number 
of said leading tool elements (1.1) as well as of said trailing tool elements 

(1.2) for triangular and rectangular profiles of said workpiece. 
Device according to Claim 12 or 13,
characterized
 in that it is applicable for cutting, for producing breakthroughs, 
perforations, grooves and notches, etc., even in non-metal 

materials such as cardboard tubes or plastic profiles. 
Device according to Claim 12,
characterized
 in that it is applicable for the operation of joining specifically 
shaped tube/hub joints, e.g. by release of straps, followers or similar 

elements engaging in the hub so as to create a positive connection. 
Device according to Claim 12,
characterized
 in that it creates the desired inner profile both by means 
of said tool elements and by the axially introduced spreading element 

configured in correspondence with the inner profile. 
Device according to Claim 12,
characterized
 in that said tool elements are extended by cam plates by 
means of a rotating movement. 
Device according to Claim 12,
characterized
 in that it is applicable as a tool combination for enlarging 
and subsequently extending additional tool segments.
