<ABSTRACT>
To operate input devices such as magnetic card readers (22) or keyswitches (23) for personal computers (11), these are connected to the keyboard processor (18) and are activated by previously unused control codes. The data of the input devices are recoded into data for possible key operations and the data transmission to the personel computer is initiated by the code for a non-existent key. As a result, the keyboard controller in the personal computer need not be reprogrammed, and the function of the input device cannot be simulated via the keyboard.

<CLAIMS>
Method for operating an input device (22, 23) at 
a keyboard (17) connecte
d to a personal computer (11) 
having a keyboard controller (15) via a data transmission 

means (16), which keyboard has a keyboard processor (18) 
having the features: 


the keyboard processor (18) sends key codes to 
the personal computer, the keyboard controller 

(15) rejecting any predetermined impermissible 
codes and only forwarding permissible codes; 
some of the permissible codes are dummy key codes 
which cannot be generated by operating the keys 

of the keyboard; 
the data of the input device are converted into 
permissible codes; 
at the same time as or after the operation of the 
input device (22, 23), the keyboard processor 

(18) sends a dummy key code which identifies the 
following data as originating from the input 

device (22, 23). 
Method according to Claim 1, having the following 
additional features: 


the keyboard controller (15) can send command 
codes to the keyboard processor (18); 
the keyboard processor (18) automatically sends 
data provided by the input device (22, 23) in 

each case, provided that this operating mode was 
requested by a command code representing an 

enable code. 
Method according to Claim 2, having the following  
 

additional features: 

when an input device (22, 23) is connected or 
operational, the keyboard processor (18) responds 

to the enable code with an acknowledgement code 
which is the same as the acknowledgement code for 

error-free execution of other command codes; 
when an input device (22, 23) is not connected or 
else is not operational, the keyboard processor 

(18) responds with a repeat code which is the 
same as the repeat code after transmission of 

undefined command codes. 
Method according to Claim 1, having the following 
addition features: 


the input device (22, 23) has different operating 
statuses, a change of operating status being 

transmitted by transmission of a dummy key code. 
Method according to one of Claims 2 or 3, having 
the following additional features: 


the input device (22, 23) has different operating 
statuses, a change of operating status being 

transmitted by transmission of a dummy key code; 
if an enable code is used, then the status of the 
input device (22, 23) is transmitted, in that 

dummy key codes that correspond to a status 
change to the actually existing status are sent.
