<ABSTRACT>
A process for the functionalisation of polymers is disclosed. Functionalisation takes place by reacting a polymer with a peroxidant, preferably the peroxydisulphate or monosulphate or sodium or potassium in an aqueous medium. The hydroxylated polymer can then be reacted with other materials, including biomolecules. Using the method of the invention, products e.g. catheters or oxygenators can be produced with improved properties hitherto unobtainable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the 
functionalisation of polymers. More particularly it 
relates to the treatment of polymers which do not 
possess groups normally considered readily reactive. 
It also relates to the coupling of so-treated polymers 
which other materials, for example, monomers, 
polymers, bioactive materials and dyes. Conventional procedures for activating the 
surface of, for example, polypropylene include the 
action of high energy radiation, glow and corona 
discharges, photoinitiation with the use of a 
sensitiser such as benzophenone, reaction with ozone, 
and surface flaming. Some of these procedures have 
the disadvantage of severely degrading the polymer and 
the use of non-aqueous media may be necessary. Early work with polypropylene was aimed at 
introducing hydroperoxides; thus in DE-A- 1595 808 and 
GB-A- 1086108 and by Jabloner and Mommar (J. Polymer 
Sci. A-1, 1972, 10, (763-778)) it was claimed that a 
cation surfactant and potassium peroxysulphate could 
be used to achieve wetting and initiate oxidation of 
polypropylene powder as slurry. The reaction was 
carried out in the presence of oxygen (e.g. at 30 
p.s.i.), at 100°C. Critical importance was attached  
 
to the presence of the cationic surfactant and it was stated 
that an anionic surfactant did not lead to significant 
hydroperoxidation. Graft copolymerization was subsequently 
carried out by addition of a redox system (e.g. ferric salt and 
benzion) and a vinyl monomer at 65°C. In many other examples the polymer (polypropylene), 
initiator (e.g. peroxysulphate) and monomer were reacted 
together. This procedure led to a high yield of homopolymer. 
Any graft copolymer was probably formed by chain transfer 
involving initial or propagating radicals and the polymer. It has now been found possible to functionalise many 
polymers by an inexpensive and simple method. It has been found 
possible to provide such a method which takes a relatively short 
time and can be effected in aqueous media. According to the present invention there is provided a 
method of functionalisating of a polymer, which method comprises 
reacting the polymer in an aqueous medium with an oxidising 
agent to produce oxygen-centered radicals which are responsible 
for introducing hydroxyl groups into the polymer, the reaction 
being carried out in the absence of (a) any additive which is 
preferentially oxidised or is reactive towards the radicals 
produced by the oxidising agent, (b) added oxygen and (c) a 
cationic surfactant.
