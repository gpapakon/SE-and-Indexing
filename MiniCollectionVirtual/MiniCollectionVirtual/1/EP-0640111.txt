<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pellets of copolymers of ethylene and
an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid, which have been surface-coated
with a low level of certain liquid additives or water-soluble solid additives.
The treated pellets have permanently increased block resistance which leads
to improved pellet production rates and handling characteristics. Many of
these additives are acceptable for food contact, allowing use of films made
from copolymer pellets surface-coated with these additives in food
packaging.Ethylene copolymer pellets have an increasing tendency to
'block', that is to say clump together, at ambient or slightly elevated
temperatures as the level of comonomer increases. However, different
comonomers affect properties of ethylene copolymers containing them,
including the tendency to block, to a differing extent for the same
comonomer level, both on a weight and mole basis. There appears to be
more than one cause of blocking. Thus, for instance, softness or flexibility
which can be a significant causative factor for some copolymers to block, is
not as important for other copolymers. In any event, when stick
temperature, a measure of pellet blocking, is below 30°C, resultant poor
pellet handling characteristics during manufacture can affect production
rates. This is partly because certain production operations such as monomer
'purging' of polymer pellets, which uses hot air, become more efficient at
higher temperatures. Increasing blocking during long storage can also
become a significant problem for polymer processors.Pellets of copolymers of ethylene with acrylic and methacrylic
acid and certain ionomers derived from these copolymers are particularly
prone to blocking. A common way of reducing blocking is by use of certain
anti-blocking additives. However, these acid copolymers and their ionomers 
are used extensively in the food packaging industry, and when so used, the
polymer must be acceptable to the FDA.Many anti-blocking additives for ethylene copolymers, are
known, but they may not all function in the same way. They may also be
effective at quite different levels. Some additives are effective for many
copolymers. Thus, U.S. Patent No. Re. 32,325 (Smith) discloses use of
certain solid bisamides to reduce blocking in a wide variety of ethylene
copolymers, including ethylene/methacrylic acid copolymers as well as
ethylene/vinyl acetate polymers and several other ethylene copolymers. The
additive is incorporated while the polymer is molten, and must migrate to
the surface of
