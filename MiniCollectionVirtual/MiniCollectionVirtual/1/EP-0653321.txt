<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for lifting an air-sprung vehicle axle (12) guided on both sides of the vehicle by means of spring links (16) which are rigidly clamped to the axle (12) at their rearward end by means of an axle clamping means (18) and are articulated on the vehicle chassis (21) ahead of the vehicle axle (12) at their forward end, e.g. by way of a bracket (20), the device having a lifting arrangement (32) which has a joint-free pressure arm (38) which extends essentially parallel to the direction of the spring links (16) and is rigidly connected in its rearward area to the axle (12) of the vehicle and on the forward end of which there acts an actuator (34) designed, for example, as a lifting bellows. The invention is characterised in that the actuator (34) is on the one hand articulated on the vehicle chassis (21) via a pivoted arm (40) which can be pivoted about a hinge (41) essentially parallel to the axle (12) of the vehicle, and is on the other hand connected to the forward end of the pressure arm (38).
