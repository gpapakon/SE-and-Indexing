<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coating composition, to a process for the colouring of shaped articles with the coating composition, and to the coated shaped articles, especially shaped articles (mouldings) of thermoplastic or thermoelastic plastics, with a primarily clear, scratchproof and weather-resistant coating in the form of a hardened thin layer which is formed on the plastic material by polymerisation of a monomeric coat of the coating composition which essentially comprises polyfunctional acrylic and/or methacrylic compounds, which layer is distinguished by anti-soiling and anti-graffiti properties. These properties are achieved by the inclusion of polymerisable acrylic and methacrylic compounds which comprise fluorine-containing alkyl groups and correspond to the formula

 in which R is H or CH3, A is C2- to C6-alkylene, R2 is H or C1- to C4-alkyl, and R3 is a fluorine-containing C2- to C20-alkyl radical.
