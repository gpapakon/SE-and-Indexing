 FLEA TRAPBackground of the Invention1. Field of the InventionThe present invention is broadly concerned with an improved flea trap designed for use in and around areas where flea infestation is a problem, such as homes, barns and livestock sheds. More particularly, it is concerned with such an improved flea trap, as well as a method of attracting fleas, which makes use of a light source operated to give effectively varying intensities over time and preferably presenting a relatively narrow visible light spectrum in order to greatly enhance the attraction and arrest (e.g., capture and/or destruction) of fleas.2. Description of the Prior ArtA number of devices have been proposed in the past for the trapping of fleas. Such units may be used for the control or reduction of flea infestations in human or pet premises, and as a research tool for monitoring or surveying flea populations.For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,044,112 describes a flea trap including a visible light source adapted to be installed close to floor level and having a reflector above the light source to reflect light downwardly; a sticky capture surface is located below the light source in order to trap fleas attracted by the light source.Despite the many attempts to provide truly useful flea traps, in general devices of this character have proven to be of limited effectiveness. Indeed, actual control testing of certain commercially available flea traps has demonstrated that they are capable of attracting and capturing only a small percentage of the available flea population. 

Summarv of the InventionThe present invention overcomes the problems outlined above, and provides a greatly improved flea trap which has proven to be capable of attracting and arresting a very large percentage of available fleas in a confined area.In one aspect of the invention, a flea trap is provided having a light source for attracting fleas, as well as operating means associated with the light source. The light source is advantageously operated to effectively vary the intensity of the light therefrom. For example, the source may be operated intermittently in an on-off manner to enhance its attractive power thereof. Alter¬ nately, means can be provided for passing an object in front of the light from time to time to create a shadow and thereby alter the effective intensity of the light source over time. In all cases, the effective intensity must sequentially drop from an elevated level to a low level, and then be raised to a level above the low level. This is in

Claims :
1. In a flea trap adapted to rest upon a surface and having a light source for attracting fleas, and means proximal to said light source for arresting attracted fleas, the improvement which comprises mounting said light source close to said surface, and means oper- ably associated with said light source for intermittently changing the effective intensity of the light from said light source in a manner to enhance the attracting power of the light source, by sequentially lowering the light intensity from an elevated level to a low level, and then raising the intensity back to a level higher than said low level, said light source operating at said higher intens¬ ity for periods of at least about 30 seconds and at said lower intensity for periods less than said higher intens¬ ity periods, the sequential higher intensity-lower inten¬ sity operation of said light source serving to attract fleas and stimulate movement thereof towards said light source and the proximal flea-arresting means.
2. The flea trap of claim l, including means coupled with said light source for intermittent on-off operation of the light source.
3. The flea trap of claim 2, said light source operating means serving to operate said light source for illumination periods of time greater than intermittent dark periods of time where the light source is not illumi¬ nated.
4. The flea trap of claim 3, said illumination periods each being from about 30 seconds-20 minutes, and said dark periods each being from about 1-60 seconds. 


 5. The flea trap of claim 4, said illumination periods being from about 2-15 minutes, and said dark periods being from about 2-20 seconds.
6. The flea trap of claim 1, said flea-arrest¬ ing means comprising adhesive means adjacent said light source for arresting fleas impinging against the adhesive means.
7. The flea trap of claim 6, said flea-arrest¬ ing means having an upright light-conveying wall with said adhesive means applied to one surface of said wall, said light source being located adjacent the opposed surface of said wall.
8. The flea trap of claim 7, said wall being annular in cross-section, said light source being disposed within said annular wall, said adhesive means being applied to the exterior surface of said annular wall.
9. The flea trap of claim 1, said light source presenting a spectrum having its maximum peak centered at a wavelength of from about 450-650 nm, and with a maximum peak half-height-width of from about 50-175 nm.
10. The flea trap of claim 9, said maximum peak being centered at a wavelength of about 475-550 n , and said maximum peak half-height-width being from about 70- 150 nm.
11. The flea trap of claim 1, said light source comprising in combination a white light source and means for filtering the white light emitted from said source for emitting a light spectrum for attracting fleas. 


 12. The flea trap of claim l, including means supporting said light source at an elevated position above the ground, said flea-arresting means including an upright wall supporting a flea-arresting adhesive.
13. The flea trap of claim 12, said light source supporting means including structure for supporting the light source at a height of from about 6-18 inches above the ground.
14. The flea trap of claim 13, said light source being supported at a height of from about 8-12 inches above the ground.
15. A method of attracting fleas comprising the steps of positioning a light source in the vicinity of fleas to be attracted and closely adjacent the ground, and intermittently altering the effective intensity of the light source in a manner to attract said fleas, said intensity altering step comprising the steps of sequen¬ tially lowering said intensity from an elevated level to a lower level, and then raising the intensity level above said low level, said light source operating at said higher intensity for periods of at least about 30 seconds and at said lower intensity for periods less than said higher intensity periods, the sequential higher intensity-lower intensity operation of said light source serving to attract fleas and stimulate movement thereof towards said light source.
16. The method of claim 15, including the step of intermittently operating said light source. 


 17. The method of claim 15, including the step of operating said light source for illumination periods of time greater than intermittent dark periods of time when the light source is not illuminated.
18. The method of claim 17, said illumination periods each being from about 30 seconds-20 minutes, and second dark periods each being from about 1-60 seconds.
19. The method of claim 18, said illumination periods being from 2-15 minutes and said dark periods being from about 2-20 seconds.
20. The method of claim 15, including the step of arresting fleas attracted towards said light source.
21. The method of claim 15, said light source presenting a spectrum having its maximum peak centered at a wavelength of from about 450-650 nm, and with a maximum peak half-height-width of from about 50-175 nm.
22. The method of claim 21, said maximum peak being centered at a wavelength of from about 475-550 n , and said maximum peak half-height-width being from about 70-150 nm.
