plurality of super blocks, and each super block comprises 

a plurality of macro blocks. A video segment comprising 
five macro blocks taken out from five super blocks located 

apart from each other on the video image, and data 
compression operation is applied in the video segment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an
apparatus for recording and reproducing a video signal,
and more particularly to an apparatus for recording and
reproducing a digital video signal which is capable of
reproducing a legible video image in high speed
reproduction of a recorded digital video signal.In an apparatus for recording and reproducing a
digital video signal (hereinafter is referred to as a
digital VTR). The amount of data to be recorded is far
more than that in an apparatus for recording and
reproducing an analog video signal. Therefore, in the
digital VTR, in order to convert the analog video signal
to the digital video signal with a conversion efficiency
as high as possible, data of a video signal is compressed
on the basis of a high efficiency coding method. The
conversion efficiency is represented by a ratio of the
amount of analog data to the amount of digital data, and
in the case that the analog data is represented by a
little digital data, the conversion efficiency increases.
The compressed data is recorded on a magnetic tape of the 
digital VTR.An example of the high efficiency coding method
is described hereafter. In the high efficiency coding
method, a video signal of one frame is divided into a
plurality of macro blocks composed of data of an area of
eight pixels in the horizontal direction and eight lines
in the vertical direction. The macro blocks are shuffled,
and subsequently, the known discrete cosine transform
operation and a variable length coding operation are
applied to the macro blocks, and each macro block is
converted to coded data. The conversion efficiency is
improved by the shuffling operation. For shuffling see EP-A-0 471
118 and EP-A-0 499 303.In the coded data of each macro block, a coded
data including a main component which is a low frequency
component of an original signal is stored in one
synchronizing block (hereinafter referred to as SYNC
block). Prior to recording the SYNC block data formed as
mentioned above in the magnetic tape, the SYNC block data
is rearranged by a recording deshuffling circuit. The
rearranged SYNC block data are recorded on the video track
of the magnetic tape in the rearranged order. By the
rearrangement, when these SYNC blocks are reproduced, the
macro blocks reproduced from the SYNC blocks which are
neighboring to each other on a video track of the magnetic
tape are placed in the immediate neighborhood on a video
image. In a high speed reproduction of the recorded
SYNC block data, video data reproduced from the video
tracks
