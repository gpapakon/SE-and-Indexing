A sound-generating reed for wind instruments, comprising 
fibre-reinforced plastics, characterised in that the basic 

plastics substance is stabilised by at least one layer (27, 29) 
having fibrous strands (31) extending unidirectionally in the 

longitudinal direction of the reed (7), individual strands (33) 
having material properties differing from those of the other 

strands so that the vibrations of the reed are damped. 
A reed according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
individual strands (33) comprise wood fibres. 
A reed according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
individual strands (33) comprise glass fibres, aramide fibres 

and/or microtubes of flexible ceramic. 
A reed according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
in that the number of fibres, the width and/or thickness of 

the individual strands (31. 33) can be determined according 
to the desired damping properties. 
A reed according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the layer (27, 29) of unidirectional fibrous strands (31, 

33) contains carbon fibres. 
A reed according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the layer (27, 29) of unidirectional fibrous strands (31, 

33) is formed as a carbon-fibre layer. 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the layer (27. 29) of unidirectional  

 
fibrous strands (31, 33) has stabilising strands extending 

transversely to the fibrous strands (31, 33). 
A reed according to claim 7, characterised in that carbon 
fibres, wood fibres, aramide fibres, glass fibres and/or 

microtubes or fibres of flexible ceramic are used as 
stabilising strands. 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims. 
characterised in that, in addition to the layer (27, 29), at least 

one carrier layer (17) is provided, the fibres of which 
preferably extend at right angles to each other. 
A reed according to claim 9, characterised in that, in 
addition to the layer (27, 29) and the carrier layer (17), at 

least one supporting layer (19) is provided, the fibres of 
which preferably extend at right angles to each other and in 

particular are arranged so as to be offset in relation to the 
fibres of the carrier layer (17). 
A reed according to claim 9 and/or 10, characterised in that 
carbon fibres, wood fibres, aramide fibres or glass fibres are 

used for the supporting layer (19) and/or carrier layer (17). 
A reed according to claim 9 and/or 10 and/or 11, 
characterised in that the carrier layer (17) and/or the 

supporting layer (19) is arranged on the underside (15) of the 
reed and in that the layer having unidirectional fibrous 

strands (27, 29) lies over these layers. 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the thickness of the reed decreases 

from a shaft (9) in the region of an aperture up to the front 
edge (23). 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the thickness of the reed (7) in the  

 
region of the shaft (9) decreases from the imaginary centre 

line of the reed to the longitudinal edges thereof. 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that approximately seven damping layers 

(27, 29), arranged one on top of another and having 
unidirectional fibrous strands (31, 33), and supporting layers 

(19) and a lowermost carrier layer (17), arranged below the 
said damping layers (27, 29), are provided in the region of 

the shaft (9). 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the underside and/or at least the 

region of the aperture are subjected to an abrasion process, 
preferably a grinding process. 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that, in the region of the edge (23) of the 

reed tip (11), at least two layers (17, 19) are provided, the 
separating plane (21) thereof being arranged substantially in 

the centre between the upper surface (25) and the 
underside (15) of the 
reed tip. 
A reed according to claim 9, 11, 12 or 15, characterised in 
that the underside (15) of the reed is formed as evenly as 

possible and in that the carrier layer (17) extends over the 
entire underside of the reed (7). 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a damping layer (35) preferably arranged 

on the upper surface (25) of the reed in the region of the 
reed tip (11). 
A reed according to claim 19, characterised in that the 
extent and shape of the damping layer (35) are selectable 

according to the desired tonal properties of the reed (7).  
 
A reed according to claim 19 or 20, characterised in that the 
damping layer (35) is formed by a preferably adhesive film. 
A reed according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a lacquer coating, preferably of shellac.
