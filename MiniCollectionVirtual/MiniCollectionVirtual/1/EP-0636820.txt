<ABSTRACT>
A sealing plate for a bearing, which includes a 
metallic ring-plate (4a), and a vulcanized elastic material 

ring-plate (5a) having an outer peripheral edge portion 
outwardly protruded from that of the metallic ring-plate (4a). 

The ring-plates are respectively punched from a metallic plate 
(4) on which an elastic material is applied and an elastic 

material plate (5) without using metal molds. The metallic 
ring-plate (4a) and the vulcanized elastic material ring-plate 

(5a) are overlapped and then bonded to each other, with 
centers thereof being aligned with each other. The outer 

peripheral edge portion of the elastic material ring-plate 
(5a) has such a width as to be bent for wrapping in the outer 

peripheral edge of the metallic ring-plate (4a) therein, when 
it is forced into a sealing groove (41a) of the bearing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sealing of a
bearing, and more particularly, to a sealing plate for a
bearing, and a method of manufacturing thereof.In a conventional sealing plate 56 for a bearing
shown in Fig. 26, a core metal formed by punching a metallic
plate is placed in a recess or concave portion of a metal mold
for molding. Then, elastic material is poured in the mold,
subsequently heated and pressurized, simultaneously vulcanized,
and thus the bearing sealing plate is formed. The
forward edge diameter of the formed sealing plate 56 is larger
than an opening diameter of a bearing sealing groove 51a, and
a wall face of the sealing groove of an outer ring 51 or inner
ring 52 of the bearing is sunken so as to force the bearing
sealing plate 56 into the sealing groove 51a, thus causing the
elastic forward edge portion of the sealing plate 56 to
depress the wall face of the sealing groove 51a to achieve the
sealing. In Fig. 26, reference numeral 50 denotes a ball of
the bearing, 53 a retainer, 54 the core metal of the sealing
plate 56, and 55 a ring-plate made of elastic material such
as synthetic rubber and having a lip 55a sliding on a tapered
face 52a of the inner ring 52. In the conventional manufacturing method of the
bearing sealing plate as described above, however, there have
been such disadvantages that, not only the metal mold is
necessary, but much expenses are required for the metal mold
due to complicated relation in constructions and shapes
between the bearing sealing plate and the sealing groove of
the bearing, while a considerable time is required for the
vulcanization of rubber with the mold, and removal of burr
from the bearing sealing plate is also required after the
molding, thus resulting in an increase of the number of
manufacturing steps and time, with a consequent rise in cost.Prior art document US-A- 4 078 287 discloses a known
method of manufacturing sealing members which comprises
the following steps. An elastic material layer having
adhesive property is formed on a surface of one of a metallic
plate and a vulcanized elastic material plate.
Punching holes are made in the metallic plate by a
punching press. Then the metallic plate is overlapped
with the elastic material having the adhesive property
being positioned between the metallic and the elastic
materials. The metallic and the elastic materials are
bonded via the elastic material layer to each other
through pressurization or pressurization and heating.
Eventually several sealing plates are punched from
said composite
