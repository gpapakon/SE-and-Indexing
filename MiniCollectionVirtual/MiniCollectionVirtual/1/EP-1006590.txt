<ABSTRACT>
Ferroelectric memory (10) includes a hollow (14) formed in a first insulation film (12). A lower
electrode (16) is formed in this hollow (14) by sol-gel method including an application process due

to a spin coat method. In this application process, a precursor solution is dripped on a
surface of the first insulation film (12) and splashed away due to centrifugal force. Due to this,

a first conductive film to being formed has an increased film thickness at portion of the
hollow where the precursor solution is ready to correct, or portion to be formed into a

lower electrode, and a decreased film thickness at portion other than the hollow.
Accordingly, it is satisfactory to etch only the hollow portion when forming a lower

electrode (16) by dry-etching the first conductive film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a ferroelectric memory and method for
manufacturing same and, more particularly, to a ferroelectric memory with a structure
formed, on an insulation film, with a lower electrode, a ferroelectric and an upper
electrode in this order, and a method for manufacturing such a ferroelectric memory.The conventional ferroelectric memory 1 of this kind, shown in Figure 13,
includes a not-shown semiconductor substrate and a first insulation film 2 formed thereon.
On the first insulation film 2, a lower electrode 3, a ferroelectric film 4 and an upper
electrode 5 are formed in this order. Further, a second insulation film 6 is formed in a
manner covering these films. To fabricate a ferroelectric memory 1, a conductive film 3a
is formed of platinum (Pt) or the like by sputtering over the first insulation film 2 formed
on the semiconductor substrate, as shown in Figure 14(A). Then, a ferroelectric film 4a is
formed of lead zirconate titanate (PZT) or the like on the conductive film 3a by a sol-gel
process. A conductive film 5a is further formed by sputtering platinum (Pt) or the like
over the ferroelectric film 4a. Then, as shown in Figure 14(B) dry etching is conducted
sequentially on the conductive film 5a, the ferroelectric film 4a and the conductive film
3a, thereby providing an upper electrode 5, a ferroelectric film 4 and a lower electrode 3.
Thereafter, an insulation film 6 (Figure 13) is formed in a manner covering these films by
a CVD process.In the prior art, however, a conductive film 5a, a ferroelectric film 4a and a 
conductive film 3a are formed to a thickness to provide an upper electrode 5, a
ferroelectric film 4 and a lower electrode 3, so that dry etching is then conducted
throughout a total film thickness in order to remove unwanted portions of these films,
Thus, the prior art has required a much etch amount and hence a long etch time. This
results in long-time exposure of the ferroelectric film 4 to the plasma atmosphere during a
dry etch process. The plasma however has effects upon the ferroelectric 4 to lower its
switching charge amount (Qsw). Thus, there has been a fear of causing such problem as
worsening the symmetry in hysteresis and deteriorating the characteristics of
coerciveness and fatigue.It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a ferroelectric
memory having a ferroelectric characteristic that is free from deterioration, and a method
for manufacturing same.A ferroelectric memory according to the present invention,
