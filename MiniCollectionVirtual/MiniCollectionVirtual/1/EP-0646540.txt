<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a free-rotation control 
apparatus in a hoist assembly in which there is provided, 

between an operating handle 18 and a stopper 17 provided 
in a driving shaft 5, a free-rotation spring 19 for urging 

the handle 18 toward the driving member 8 and urging the 
driving member 8 in the brake releasing direction. When 

the operating handle 18 is pulled out, the driving member 
8 is rotated by a torsional urging force of the spring 19 

so as to separate from a driven member 7. Thereupon a 
braking action caused by a braking ratchet wheel 11 and 

braking plates 9, 10 is cancelled and engagement lugs 31 
are brought into resilient contact with free-rotation 

control surfaces 35 by an axial urging force of the spring 
19, so that the free-rotation control can be maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a free-rotation
control apparatus of a hoist and traction machine, and more
particularly to a free-rotation control apparatus adapted to
make it possible that a load sheave rotates freely by
setting a mechanical brake of a hoist and traction machine
to the inactivated state.Conventionally, for use in a hoist and traction machine
there have been proposed various free-rotation control
apparatus adapted to allow a load sheave to rotate freely so
as to enable an operator to pull out and pull back a load
chain rapidly. One of them is the following free-rotation
control apparatus (refer to the Specification and the
Drawings of Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 3(1991)-241372)
previously proposed by the applicant of this
invention. This apparatus has a stopper disposed at an
axial end of its driving shaft, an operating handle
interposed between the stopper and a driving member
threadably mounted to the driving shaft and interlocked with
driving means such as an operating lever so as to be axially
movable between a steady state position in which it is near
to the driving member and a free-rotation position in which
it is spaced apart therefrom and to be impossible to rotate
relatively with respect to the driving shaft, and a
resilient pushing member interposed between the operating
handle and the stopper so as to urge the handle toward the
driving member. In the lever-type hoist and traction
machine, when the operating handle is pulled out to the
free-rotation position and is made to turn in the hoist and 
traction direction under such a condition that the rotation
of the driving member is blocked, the driving shaft is
rotated, so that the driving member threadably mounted to
the driving shaft can be moved back with respect to a lining
plate of a mechanical brake. When an action of the
mechanical brake is released by that moving back, the free-rotation
control can be carried out and the operating handle
can be brought into resilient contact with the driving
member by a pushing force of the resilient pushing member
under that condition so as to maintain the free-rotation
controlling state.In the free-rotation control apparatus having the
above-mentioned construction, since the operating handle is
brought into resilient contact with the driving member by
the urging force of the resilient pushing member at the time
of free-rotation controlling so as to restrain a relative
rotation of the driving member with respect to the driving
shaft and maintain the free-rotation control, when
