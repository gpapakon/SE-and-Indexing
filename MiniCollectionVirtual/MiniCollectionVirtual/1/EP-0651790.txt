 TYPE-C ROTAVIRUS CULTURES AND USES THEREFORCross-Reference to Related ApplicationMark . Welter, David M. Chambers and C. Joseph Welter filed an application entitled TYPE-B ROTAVIRUS CULTURES AND USES THEREFOR on November 13, 1989, Ser. No. 07/434.209. This application is commonly owned.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to propagation of Type- C rotaviruses in a diploid cell culture with reduced concentrations of proteolytic enzyme and subsequent production of antigen and antiserum for use in diagnostic kits and production of vaccines, both modified live and formalin killed, to prevent Type-C rotavirus infections.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONRotavirus is the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in infants and piglets (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 17, 20, 27, 37) . Rotaviruses, which are found in a great variety of animal species, are named for their characteristic wheel¬ like appearance under the electron microscope. Like other Reoviridae, their genome is in the form of double-stranded (ds) RNA, although they may be distinguished from reoviruses and orbiviruses by the division of their genome into 11 ds RNA segments."In 1983, Pedley (24) classified the rotaviruses into several types of groups on the basis of serological differences, immunofluorescence, and nucleic acid differences characterized by one dimensional terminal fingerprint analysis. RNA electropherotype has also been used as a basis for classification (29) . Group A rotaviruses are considered "typical"; all others (B, C, D, E) are referred to as "atypical." Type-C (Group-C) rotaviruses, sometimes referred 

to as pararotavirus, have been found to produce gastroenteritis in chickens, pigs, and also in humans (1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34). A panel of sixteen monoclonal antibodies have been made to the porcine Type-C rotavirus (Cowden strain) , with four of these having neutralizing capabilities. Only Type-C antigens were detected by the monoclonal antibodies tested, and no reactions were seen with Type-A or Type-B rotaviruses (23) .Analysis of the structural polypeptides of porcine Type-C rotavirus by Western blot analysis has revealed that there is a lack of cross-reaction between the structural polypeptides of porcine rotaviruses Types A, supporting the fact that both are distinctly different from each other, and thus the different serogroup classification (6, 18, 23).Type-C rotavirus has been implicated as a cause of diarrhea in nursing and weakling pigs (4, 8, 15, 17, 21) . Diagnostic surveys, conducted

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for propagating a Group C rotavirus in cell culture which comprises passaging a Group C rotavirus in diploid cells capable of supporting the growth of the virus for at least five passages, said cells being provided with a medium which supports the growth of the cells and is further characterized as having a non-cytopathic amount of proteolytic enzymes which can exert a cytopathic effect on said rotavirus.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the cells are swine testicular cells.
3. The method according to claim 1 wherein the growth medium includes trypsin.
4. The method according to claim 3 wherein the trypsin is present in amounts ranging from about 10 to less than 80 μg/ml.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein said rotavirus is serially passaged in ST cells until it has become essentially non-pathogenic without substantial loss of immunogenicity.
6. The method of claim 1 wherein said rotavirus is serially passaged for at least about 22 passages in ST cells.
7. The method of claim 6 wherein said rotavirus is serially passaged for at least about 30 passages in ST cells.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the culture medium includes a proteolytic enzyme.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein the medium is essentially free of pancreatin and pancreatin components other than trypsin.
10. The method according to claim 1 wherein the pH ranges from about 6 to about 8.
11. The method of claim 1 wherein the cytopathic effect of the Group C rotavirus is observed periodically to confirm successful passage of the virus.
12. A vaccine comprising an effective amount of a Group C rotavirus propagated according to claim 1 in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, said virus having been rendered essentially nonpathogenic. 


 13. An attenuated vaccine comprising an effective amount of a Group C rotavirus propagated according to claim 5, said propagation having rendered the virus essentially nonpathogenic, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
14. An attenuated vaccine comprising an effective amount of a Group C rotavirus propagated according to claim 6, said propagation having rendered the virus essentially nonpathogenic, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
15. A killed vaccine comprising an effective amount of a Group C rotavirus propagated according to claim 1 and subsequently inactivated to render the virus essentially nonpathogenic, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
16. A method for immunizing a human or animal for an infection caused by a Group C rotavirus comprising administering to said human or animal a vaccine according to claim 12.
17. A method of protecting neonatal nursing mammals from an infection caused by a Group C rotavirus comprising administering to pregnant host mammals within six weeks prior to parturition a vaccine according to claim 12, thereby inducing an immune response in said host, whereby passive protection from said infection is provided by the colostrum and milk fed by said host to neonatal nursing mammals.
18. A method for the detection of antibodies to a Type C rotavirus in a sample which comprises incubating the sample with viral particles of a Type C rotavirus propagated according to the method of claim 1, whereby antibodies in said sample bind to at least some of said viral particles, and detecting the presence of antibodies bound to the viral particles.
19. The method of claim 18 in which the antibodies are human antibodies and the propagated Type C rotavirus was obtained from a porcine source. 


 20. The method of claim 19 wherein the bound antibody is detected by further incubating the bound antibodies with anti-human IgG-FITC.
21. The method of claim 18 in which said antibodies neutralize the viral particles to which they are bound, and the neutralized particles and hence the bound antibodies are detected by exposing the particles to swine testicular cells and detecting the infection of said cells by unbound viral particles.
22. An antigenic reagent comprising one or more Type C rotavirus antigens obtained by propagating a Type C rotavirus according to the method of claim 1, lysing the host cells, and at least partially purifying viral antigens from the lysate, said reagent being further characterized in that the viral antigens are presented in labeled or immobilized form.
23. An immunogenic composition comprising one or more Type C rotavirus antigens obtained by a process comprising propagating a Type C rotavirus according to the method of claim 1 and lysing the host cells, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, said composition being capable of raising antibodies in an immunocompetent subject, said antibodies being immunologically cross-reactive with Type C rotavirus.
24. A method for immunizing a human or animal which comprises administering an immunogenic composition according to claim 23.
25. A composition comprising an antibody raised against a Type C rotavirus, or against an antigenic preparation derived from a Type C rotavirus, where the rotavirus has been propagated according to the method of claim 1.
