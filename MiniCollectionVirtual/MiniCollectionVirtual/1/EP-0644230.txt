<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the treatment or recycling of polyolefins and polyolefin-containing composite materials for complete material recycling of the individual components containing one or more further synthetic polymers and/or metal and/or natural polymers. The object is to provide a process for the treatment of composite materials containing polyolefins which is technically straight-forward and unproblematic from the aspect of industrial safety, by means of which a qualitatively better polyolefin can be obtained and in addition the process can be carried out economically and ecologically. The object is achieved according to the invention by treatment with a solvent. The solvents used according to the invention are cycloalkanes, n-alkanes and isoalkanes, which are also employed as a mixture. After the insoluble components have been separated off, the polyolefin solution and an aqueous surfactant solution are dispersed in one another according to the invention. The dispersion obtained from this treatment, which comprises precipitated polyolefin, an aqueous phase and an organic phase, is then separated into its constituents in a manner known per se. The particular advantage of the process is also that specific particle sizes can be produced with optimised dry-flow properties. It is of course also possible to produce the desired particle sizes from virgin plastics using this process.
