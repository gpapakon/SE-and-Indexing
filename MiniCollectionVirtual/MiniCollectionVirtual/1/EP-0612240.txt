 METHOD FOR EXTENDING THE VASCULAR DWELL-TIMEOF PARTICULATE THERAPEUTIC ANDPARTICULATE DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS1. TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a method for increasing the vascular dwell-time of a particulate10 therapeutic or particulate diagnostic agent in a mammal through the adjunct administration of an effective amount of the particulate therapeutic or particulate diagnostic agent and an effective amount of a vascular dwell-time enhancing agent. This method, therefore, provides a15 means by which a therapeutic or diagnostic agent is capable of expressing its efficacy by remaining within the vascular compartment or being carried within the vascular compartment to a target. Accordingly, this method is particularly well-suited for treating several20 conditions in a mammal, including hypoxia, hypoxemia, anemia, infection and cancer as well for imaging selected regions within a mammal by various imaging technigues, including ultrasound imaging, X-ray imaging and MRI.25 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe efficacy of many therapeutic and diagnostic agents is predicated on the ability of these agents to be retained within the vascular compartment or to be carried within the vascular compartment to their target within a30 mammal. Unfortunately, many of these agents when they are within the vascular compartment appear particulate in size, as this concept is defined below in Section 4.1. Because these agents activate or prime phagocytes (phagocytic cells) that are present within the vascular35 compartment and in fixed tissues of the body, they are susceptible to phagocytosis and pinocytosis. The triggering of these two processes in turn results in the accelerated removal of these agents from the vascular 

 compartment. These agents are then stored within the organs of the reticuloendothelial system, as well as other tissues, until they are metabolized or excreted. In this context, the length of time during which these agents are within the vascular compartment, that is, their vascular dwell-time (intravascular persistence) , is relatively short. Because these agents display short dwell- imes within the vascular compartment, the ability °f these agents to express their efficacy is severely compromise .Furthermore, when the phagocytic response induced by these agents is particularly pronounced, the phagocytes that are present within the vasuclar compartment and the fixed tissues of the body often trigger a number of secondary responses which, in turn, cause a number of negative side-effects.
