<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a gas-insulated high-voltage switch installation having an encapsulating housing (enclosure) (13) and an opening (9) which is surrounded by a flange (25), a current transformer (4, 16) which is arranged in the encapsulating housing (1, 13) is fastened on a housing part (10, 17) which is flange-connected to the flange, such that said current transformer (4, 16) can be moved together with the housing part, and, in particular, can be removed from the encapsulating housing (1, 13) with particularly little complexity. The bushings for the measurement leads of the current transformer (4, 16) are advantageously integrated in the housing part (10, 17) so that no disconnection of the measurement leads (22) is necessary during dismantling of the housing part (10, 17) with the current transformer (4, 16).

<CLAIMS>
Gas-insulated high-voltage switchgear having a 
one-part encapsulating housing (1, 13), which has at 

least one opening (9, 26) and a flange (18, 25) 
surrounding said opening, and having a housing portion 

(10, 17), which is flange-connected to the flange (18, 
25) and seals the opening tightly, and also having a 

toroidal-core current transformer (4, 16) which is 
arranged in the encapsulating housing (1, 13) and has a 

support tube (18) which is surrounded by toroidal cores 
(27, 28), is fastened in a load-bearing manner to the 

housing portion (17) and is movable therewith, 
characterised in that the toroidal cores (27, 28) 

inside the encapsulating housing (1, 13) are freely 
accessible from their circumferential side, and in that 

a lead-through for the instrument leads (22) of the 
current transformer (16) is integrated into the housing 

portion (17). 
High-voltage switchgear according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the opening (9, 26) is 

dimensioned in such a way that the current transformer 
(4, 16) can pass through it. 
High-voltage switchgear according to claim 1 
or one of the following claims, characterised in that 

the housing portion (10) is a covering flange. 
High-voltage switchgear according to claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the housing portion (17) is 

a reducer. 
High-voltage switchgear according to claim 1 
or one of the following claims, characterised in that 

the current transformer (4) is connected to the housing 
portion (10) by way of a plurality of bars (11, 12). 
High-voltage switchgear according to claim 1 
or one of the following claims, characterised in that 

the support tube (18) is connected in one piece to the 
housing portion (17).  

 
High-voltage switchgear according to claim 1 
or one of the following claims, characterised in that 

the end of the support tube (18) that faces away from 
the housing portion (17) is detachably connected to a 

screening electrode (19).
