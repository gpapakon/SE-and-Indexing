<ABSTRACT>
A method of resistance heating using a graphite 
container (10) having a graphite body (12) and a 

pyrolytic boron nitride coating (14) in which a metal 
charge of predetermined weight is deposited over the 

coating (14) and the container (10) is heated by the 
application of a variable source of electrical power 

to cause the metal charge to fully evaporate in a 
short interval of time of less than two minutes with 

the heat cycle controlled to provide a cool down 
period in each cycle of applied power and with a new 

metal charge introduced upon completion of each heat 
cycle in a semi-continuous fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
evaporating a metal using a graphite container having a
pyrolytic boron nitride coating.Many metals such as aluminum, copper,
chromium, zinc and tin are coated onto various
substrates such as metal, glass and plastic by a
vacuum deposition process in which a container is
heated by electric resistance heating to vaporize
metal fed into contact with the container. The
container, which is commonly referred to as a "boat",
is connected in an electric circuit in a series
circuit relationship so that current flows directly
through the boat, which in turn heats the metal in
contact with the boat until it vaporizes. The metal
is vaporized in an evacuated atmosphere for coating a
product which may be individually introduced into the
evacuated chamber or continuously fed through the
chamber. Discreet products may include a television
picture tube, an automobile head light, a toy or the
like.Presently, most resistance heated containers
are composed of an intermetalic ceramic composite of
titanium diboride and boron nitride alone or in
combination with aluminum nitride. The composite has
a very short lifetime and requires continual
adjustment of the power supply. Moreover, the 
resistance characteristics of such heaters are not
stable during operation since the metal component of
the ceramic composite is a conductor which forms part
of the electrical circuit. As a result metal
vaporization is not uniform resulting in a
non-uniform metal deposition.A container of graphite coated with
pyrolytic boron nitride has been suggested for use as
an alternative to a resistance heater composed of an
intermetallic ceramic composite. The coating of
pyrolytic boron nitride is intended to electrically
isolate the molten metal in the container from the
current path through the graphite body and to supply
more uniform heat to the metal. It has instead been
discovered that the molten metal after only a short
time interval will pass through the layer planes of
the pyrolytic boron nitride coating and directly
infiltrate the porous graphite body. Changes in the
thermal cycle causes the boron nitride coating to
crack within a short operating time interval. This
destroys the utility of the graphite for use as a
metal evaporator. Increasing the thickness of the
pyrolytic boron nitride coating can delay, but will
not significantly prevent leakage through the boron
nitride coating. L.A. Seliverstov in instruments and Experimental
Techniques col. 22, No. 1 (1979) pp 253-5 describes a

A method of evaporating a metal using a
graphite container (10) having a graphite body (12)

and a pyrolytic boron nitride coating (14) comprising
the steps of: depositing a metal charge of

predetermined weight into said container (10) over
said boron nitride coating (14); applying electrical

power to said container (10) such that current flows
directly through the graphite body (12) to cause the

metal charge to fully evaporate within a finite time
interval of less than two (2) minutes, varying the

electrical power being applied to said container (10)
to control the heat cycle across said boron nitride

coating (14) and to provide a cool down period in each
cycle of applied power, and introducing a new charge

of metal into said container (10) in a semi-continuous
fashion upon completion of each heat cycle.
A method of evaporating a metal using a
graphite container (10) having a graphite body (12)

with a cross sectional area of between 15 sq. mm and
72 sq.mm and a maximum length of 20.32cms (8 inches),

and a pyrolytic boron nitride coating (14) of between
0.025cms and 0.05cms (.010 and .020 inches) thick,

comprising the steps of: depositing a metal charge
selected from the group consisting of aluminum,

copper, zinc and tin with said metal charge having a
predetermined weight of between 6 mg and 200 mg into

said container (10) with the boron nitride coating
(14) separating the graphite body (12) from the metal

charge; applying electrical power with a constant
current and a variable voltage of between 4 to 25

volts to said graphite container (10) for a controlled
short interval of time of less than two (2) minutes 

sufficient to cause the metal charge to fully
evaporate in said time interval and the current to

flow directly through said graphite body (12); varying
the electrical power applied to said container (10) to

control the heat cycle across said coating (14) with
said electrical power being interrupted repetitively

to provide a minimum cool down period with essentially
no current flow between each application of applied

power and introducing a new charge of metal into said
container (10) during said cool down period.
