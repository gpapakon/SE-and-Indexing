<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the transfer and 
exchange of fluids and, more particularly, to the 
automatic transfer of fluids from a first containment area 
to a second containment area with a reconciliatory 
replenishment of fluid to the first containment area from 
a new fluid source. With the growing concern of the potential impact 
hazardous fluids and the possible potential impact certain 
other fluids have on the environment, it is prudent to 
cautiously and carefully handle and use these kind of 
fluids. It is necessary to make sure that in utilizing 
potentially harmful fluids they are not wasted or spilled 
onto the ground only to contaminate the surrounding 
environment. In dealing with these problems, the government has 
promulgated regulations aimed at controlling certain 
fluids that are radioactive, caustic, toxic, carcinogenic, 
corrosive, volatile, etc. in order to protect ourselves 
and the environment. Various schedules have been devised 
that list the fluids which are to be accorded special 
treatment due to their nature. The fluids that have been 
listed by the government as "hazardous" requires handlers 
to follow strict regulations concerning use, storage, and 
transportation. Instead of letting these type of fluids 
leak or leach into the environment after being used, they 
must be contained and then properly disposed or recycled. Certain fluids regardless of their classification, 
can be recycled for reuse. Recycling helps preserve and 
protect the environment as well as conserve natural 
resources. In the recycling of fluids, it is prudent that 
as much of the fluid be recovered as possible, therefore 
the containment of the fluid is important. One fluid that is currently of concern is oil. While 
at present, oil is not scheduled as a hazardous fluid 
within government regulations and definitions, oil is 
recyclable, potentially hazardous to the environment, and  
 
is contemplated to eventually be listed as hazardous 
within government regulations. Most fluids, including oil, are utilized in contained 
spaces that eventually need to be drained and refilled. 
It is often messy and time-consuming to drain and refill 
these contained spaces as well as difficult to put the 
recovered fluid into a storage or shipping container once 
the contained space has been drained. In addition, the 
contained space generally needs to be thoroughly flushed 
of the old fluid prior to the refilling. Further, the 
contained space will most likely need to be replenished 
with a reconciliatory

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for the automatic evacuation 
and transfer of a fluid from a first containment area (16) 

into a second containment area (44), including automatic 
replenishment of the first containment area (16) with a 

reconciliatory amount of new fluid from a fluid source 
(116), means (12) for automatically evacuating and 

transferring the fluid from a said first containment area 
(16) into a said second containment area (44), means (14) 

for automatically filling a said first containment area 

(16) with a reconciliatory amount of new fluid after a 
said first containment area has been evacuated; the 

apparatus characterized by said evacuation and

(22) and an evacuation outlet end (42), said evacuation 
inlet end having first means (20) for releasably 

connecting said evacuation inlet end (22) with a said 
first containment area (16) so as to be in fluid 

communication therewith, and said evacuation outlet end 
(42) having second means for releasably connecting said 

evacuation outlet end (42) with a said second containment 
area (44) so as to be in fluid communication therewith; 

said filling means (14) including a filling inlet end 
(114) and a filling outlet end (84), said filling inlet 

end (114) in communication with a said new fluid source 
(116), and said filling outlet end (84) having third means 

(80) for releasably connecting said filling outlet end 
(84) to a said first containment area (16) so as to be in 

fluid communication therewith; and a pump (36) disposed in 
said conduit for generating a suction pressure at said 

evacuation inlet end, a pressure transducer (32) disposed 
within said conduit between said evacuation inlet end and 

said pump providing a signal (PT2, PS2) indicative of the 
pressure within said conduit, means (88) for supplying and 

regulating a flow of pressurized air into a said first 
containment area, whereby the flow of pressurized air and 

said pump simultaneously act to cooperatively evacuate and  
 

transfer a said first containment area of fluid; and 
automatic electronic control means (100) in communication 

with said evacuation and transferring means (12) and said 
filling means (14) for automatically controlling the 

automatic evacuation and transfer of fluid from a said 
first containment area (16) into a said second containment 

area (44) and the automatic reconciliatory replenishment 
of new fluid into a said first containment area (16) from 

a said fluid source (116) while said evacuation means (12) 
and said filling means (14) are in communication with a 

said first containment area (16) and a said second 
containment area (44). 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a sampling means (56) is included in communication with said 

evacuation and transferring means for automatically obtaining a 
sample of the fluid during evacuation and transference of the 

fluid from a said first containment area. 
An apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said sampling means (56) comprises: a conduit (50) having 

one end in communication with said evacuation and transferring 
means and another end terminating at a sampling area; and a 

solenoid valve (52) disposed in said conduit and in communication 
with said control means; whereby said control means regulates the 

quantity and rate of fluid that flows from said another end by 
adjusting said solenoid valve accordingly. 
An apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that a flow meter (104) is included having an output (FM1) in
