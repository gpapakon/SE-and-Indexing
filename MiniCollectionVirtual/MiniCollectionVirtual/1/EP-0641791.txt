<ABSTRACT>
A benzothiophene derivative represented by general formula (I) or a salt thereof, which has an excellent antiestrogenic activity 
and is useful for treating breast cancer, endometrial cancer, endometriosis, mastopathy, and so forth. This compound is 

characterized in that the 2-position, i.e. substituent RÂ², of the benzothiophene ring is substituted by a halogen atom, a lower 
alkyl group, or a cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl group which may be substituted by a lower alkyl, hydroxy, acyloxy or oxo.

and endometrial cancer, the activities of the estrogen 
receptor and the estrogen-biosynthesizing enzyme in the
tumor tissue are higher than those in the normal mammary
gland tissue and the endometrial tissue, and the proliferation
of these tumors have close relation to endogenous
or local increase of estrogenic activity. Thus as one
means for therapy of gynecologic cancers, it is put into
practice to make competition against the estrogenic
effect in the estrogenic target tissue, namely to administer
antiestrogenic agents.Among these antiestrogenic agents, a compound
of the following formula called
