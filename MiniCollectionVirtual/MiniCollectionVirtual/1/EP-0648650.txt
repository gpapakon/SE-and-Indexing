<ABSTRACT>
An electric ignition device for a gas generating device for a life-saving airbag used on an automobile and so 
forth that is intended to improve the properties of a heating element in a short period of time. An electric ignition 

device for a gas generating device wherein a pair of electrodes (22) formed of metal film are disposed on the surface 
of an insulating thin plate (21) at a predetermined interval, and wherein the pair of electrodes are integrally connected 

to each other by means of at least one heating element (23) formed of metal film, the electric ignition device being 
characterized in that at least two trimmings (24) cut off in a widthwise direction of the heating element are provided 

in the heating element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electric igniter for a gas 
generator which is used to inflate a lifesaving air bag installed 
in automobiles and others. As an example of prior electric igniters for a gas generator 
of lifesaving air bags, one disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-open Print No. 64-75896 has been known. The above electric igniter will be described with reference 
to Fig. 6 and Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 6, an electric igniter 1 for a gas 
generator comprises a pair of electrodes 3, 3 which are disposed 
at a certain interval in front and rear of a rectangular ceramic 
insulating thin plate 2 with a thickness of about 0.6 mm and 
two heating elements 4, 4 which are disposed between the 
electrodes 3, 3. The electrodes 3 and the heating elements 4 are made of 
nickel chrome, tantalum nitride or other metallic membrane and 
integrally formed on the top of the insulating thin plate 2. For example, this electric igniter 1 for a gas generator is 
produced by the following method. First, a metallic membrane of about 500 to 5000Ã… is 
uniformly deposited on the entire surface of the rectangular 
ceramic insulating thin plate 2 with a thickness of about 0.6 mm 
by the sputtering method or the vacuum deposition method. Then,  
 
the metallic membrane is subjected to the photo-etching method 
to leave a required portion and, the electrodes 3 and the heating 
elements 4 are integrally formed by the metallic membrane. With reference to Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, an example of fitting 
the electric igniter 1 for a gas generator configured as 
described above to an igniting device for a gas generator will 
be described. The electric igniter 1 for a gas generator is fitted within 
a plug 5. The plug 5 consists of two-pieces divided type plug bodies 6 
and a lid 7 and is protected by a plug case 8 made of aluminum, 
iron or stainless steel, for example. The plug bodies 6 and the lid 7 are made of an insulating 
resin such as polyethylene, vinyl chloride or polyphenylene 
sulphide resin. On the plug bodies 6, a crimp-style terminal accommodating 
section 9 and a lead wire accommodating section 10 are formed, 
and pressing projections 11, 12 are disposed on the crimp-style 
terminal accommodating section 9 and the lead wire accommodating 
section 10, respectively. When the plug bodies 6 are joined 
together, the pressing projections 11, 12 press to fix a 
projection piece 14 of a crimp-style terminal 13 and a lead 
wire 15 . To join the plug bodies 6, a semicircular pillar-shaped 
fitting piece 16 is formed on
