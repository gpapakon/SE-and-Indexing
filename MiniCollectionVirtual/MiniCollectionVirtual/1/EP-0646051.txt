<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for treatment of waste materials including pathogenic microorganisms comprises shredding of the waste material to form a finely divided particulate matter, treating the finely divided particulate matter with a 1-10 % solution of hydrogen peroxide, subsequently treating the wetted mass with lime or quicklime, subsequently adding a mineral absorbent such as betonite to absorb excess liquid and then adding sodium silicate as a binder to form a sterile hardened mass which may be safely disposed of in a land fill site.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with the disposal of
wastes which are or may become biologically active, waste
materials including, but not limited to, hospital waste
materials comprising clinical waste materials including
pathogenic materials, quarantine wastes, sewerage
sludges, putrescible food wastes and the like as well as
wastes which may contain heavy metals.Hitherto the disposal of clinical waste
materials has been confined generally to incineration.
Apart from being environmentally unacceptable in terms of
CO2, CO, NOx, So2, halogenated hydrocarbon and dioxin
emissions, this form of disposal of waste materials has
not been proven safe in that average incineration
temperatures may not be great enough to destroy
biologically active materials present in the clinical
wastes. Furthermore, during the start up of an
incineration phase, before effective temperatures are
reached, there may occur emissions of bacteria and other
microorganisms and pathogenic material generally.Similarly, disposal of quarantine wastes such as
foodstuffs and plant specimens is usually carried out by
incineration with the same degree of uncertainty as to
the possibility of release of active plant and animal
pathogens to the atmosphere.Sewerage sludges and putrescible organic food
waste materials are usually buried in urban land fill
sites with significant risk of release of gaseous
pathogens to the atmosphere, but, more importantly, it is
known that such organic materials decompose to release
large quantities of methane gas, a known contributor to
the "greenhouse effect".Apart from incineration or burying in urban
landfill sites, there presently exists no known
biologically and environmentally safe method of disposal
of wastes including organic materials which may include, 
or generate during decomposition, biologically
threatening consequences.Accordingly, it is an aim of the present
invention to overcome or ameliorate the known
disadvantages of disposal of waste materials, including
pathogenic organisms and to provide a general method for
safe disposal of organic wastes.According to one aspect of the present invention
there is provided a method for disposal of waste
materials comprising the steps of:-
treating waste material with an oxidising
solution;subsequently treating said waste material with
an alkaline oxide or hydroxide;mixing the treated waste material with an
absorbent material to absorb excess liquid; andoptionally mixing said treated waste material
with an effective quantity of a binding material such as
alkaline

<CLAIMS>
A method for treatment of waste materials
comprising the steps of:-


shredding a waste material to obtain a finely
divided particulate material;
treating said waste material with an oxidising
solution;
subsequently treating said waste material with
an alkaline earth oxide or hydroxide; and
mixing the treated waste material with an
absorbent material to absorb excess liquid, the resultant

treated waste material comprising a moist particulate
disinfected mass.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
resultant moist particulate mass is further treated with

a cementitious binder.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the
cementitious binder comprises portland cement, fly ash or

alkaline earth silicate.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1-3
wherein said alkaline earth oxide comprises calcium or

magnesium oxide.
A method as claimed in any one of claim 1-3
wherein said alkaline earth hydroxide comprises calcium

or magnesium hydroxide.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the absorbent material comprises a siliceous

mineral compound.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the oxidising solution comprises an aqueous

peroxide solution.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim
wherein the oxidising solution comprises aqueous hydrogen

peroxide.
An apparatus for carrying out the method of any
preceding claim, said apparatus comprising:-


a feed hopper; 
a shredding means with an inlet associated with
said feed hopper;
a mixing means adapted to receive shredded

material from said shredder;
a first metering means to introduce an oxidising
solution into said feed hopper as a spray of droplets;
a second metering means to introduce an alkaline
earth oxide or hydroxide into said mixing means;
a third metering means to introduce a mineral
absorbent into said mixing means; and,
discharge means to discharge treated material
from said mixing means.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 9 including a
further metering means to introduce a cementitious binder

into said mixing means.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 9 or claim 10
wherein the shredding means comprises a primary and

secondary shredder.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claim 9-11
wherein said mixing means comprises a high shear mixer.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 12 wherein said
high shear mixer comprises a paddle mixer.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claim 9-13
including weighing means to determine the mass of waste

material to be treated.
An apparatus as claimed in any one of claim 9-14
including respective metering means to selectively

introduce said oxidant solution, said alkaline earth
oxide or hydroxide, said mineral absorbent and said

cementitious binder at predetermined rates.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 15 including
microprocessor control means coupled to said weighing

means and said respective metering means to selectively
control respective ratios of waste material, oxidising

solution, alkaline earth oxide or hydroxide, mineral
absorbent and cementitious binder.
