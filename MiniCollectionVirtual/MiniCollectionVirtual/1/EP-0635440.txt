<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is firstly a method for reducing emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere during the storage of liquid storage products in tanks by means of a roof which is movable in the vertical direction inside the respective tank and follows the filling level of the storage product, in which precautions are made for sealing off against liquid passing through to the top in the region of the edge gap between the outer circumference of the roof and the inner wall of the tank. In this case, according to the invention the edge gap between the inner wall of the tank and the outer circumference of the roof is filled with a sealing liquid which has a lower density than the storage product and has a vapour pressure which is small compared to that of the storage product. Additionally, the invention also relates to an arrangement for reducing emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere during the storage of liquid storage products in tanks by means of a roof which is movable in the vertical direction inside the respective tank and follows the filling level of the storage product, which arrangement has an edge gap (6) between the inner wall (2) of the tank (1) and the outer circumference (5) of the roof (4), which edge gap is filled with a sealing liquid (10) which has a lower density than the storage product (3) and has a vapour pressure which is small compared to that of the storage product.
