<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to cosmetic or dermatological compositions containing in a cosmetically acceptable aqueous medium at least: from 20 to 50 % by weight of a surfactant comprised of an alkali, ammonium or amine salt of an oxyethylenated alkylethersulfate having from 1 to 7 moles of ethylene oxide; from 0.5 to 8 % by weight of fatty acid monoethanolamide C8-C18; sodium or ammonium chloride in weight proportions comprised between 1.5 and 5 %, the ratio between the sodium chloride or the ammonium chloride and the surfactant being comprised between 0.3 and 0.25, the amount of surfactants, of monoethanolamide and of sodium or ammonium chloride being such that the composition has a viscosity after dilution per 60 and 400 parts of water for 100 g of composition comprised between 100 PAS and 0.5 PAS measured at 25  C with a rheometer with an imposed strain Carrimed CSL for a strain expressed in N.M-2 equal to or smaller than 80.
