<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dark, neutral 
colored glass that has low visible light transmittance, 
particularly low ultraviolet radiation transmittance, and 
low total solar energy transmittance. Although not 
limited to a particular use, the glass exhibits a 
combination of properties that makes it highly desirable 
for use in privacy glazings such as in the rear portions 
of vehicles such as vans. These properties include low 
visible light transmittance to reduce visibility of the 
contents of the vehicle, low infrared and total solar 
energy transmittance to reduce heat gain in the interior 
of the enclosure, low ultraviolet radiation transmittance 
to protect fabrics and other interior components from 
degradation, preferably a neutral green-gray color for the 
sake of coordinating with a wide range of interior and 
exterior finish colors, and a composition compatible with 
flat glass manufacturing methods, e.g., conventional 
commercial float glass processes. Glasses with good infrared absorption are usually 
produced by reducing iron present in the glass to the 
ferrous state or by adding copper. Such materials give 
glasses a blue color. The materials added to achieve good 
ultraviolet radiation absorption are Fe3+, Ce, Ti or V.  
 
The quantities added to cause the desired level of 
ultraviolet absorption are such as to tend to color the 
glass yellow. The combination in the same glass of both 
good UV and good IR absorption gives glasses whose color 
is either green or blue. Proposals have been made to 
produce vehicle glazings with good protection against IR 
and UV radiation in gray or bronze, but the proposed 
glasses tend to have a greenish yellow tinge. Prior art heat absorbing glasses which are neutral 
and of a blue, green, gray or bronze tint tend to have 
considerably higher solar light transmittances than would 
be desirable in privacy glazings. For example, U.S. 
Reissue Patent No. 25,312 is directed to a gray glass 
composition containing 0.2 to 1 percent Fe2O3, 0.003 to 
0.05 percent NiO, 0.003 to 0.02 percent CoO and 0.003 to 
0.02 percent Se and having a visible transmittance of 
between 35 and 45 percent at 0.25 inch thickness. A typical dark gray prior art glass has the following 
composition: 72.9% SiO2, 13.7% Na2O, .03% K2O, 8.95% CaO, 
3.9% MgO, .10% Al2O3, .27% SO3, .06% Fe2O3, .015% CoO and 
.095% NiO. Solar energy absorption of this type of glass 
is not as low as would be desired for the purposes of the 
present invention. More recently nickel-free heat
