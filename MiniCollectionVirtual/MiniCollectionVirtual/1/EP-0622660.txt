<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is an electrochromic window comprising two glass sheets (1, 2), each of which is coated with a transparent electrically conductive layer (3, 4) and separated by an electrode (5) made of an electrochromic material, an electrolyte (6) and a counterelectrode (7), the said electrically conducting layers (3, 4) being, on the one hand, connected via current leads (8, 9) to a power supply system generating a potential difference (U1) as a function of the modification of the coloration of the electrochromic material which is desired, and connected, on the other hand, to each other in the region of at least part of their periphery via an electronically conducting material (11).
