<ABSTRACT>
The inorganic membrane consists of a macroporous inorganic support and an inorganic membrane layer. The membrane layer is formed through depositing an inorganic layer by "Chemical Vapour Deposition" or "sputtering" on the macroporous support, onto this inorganic layer a photo-lacquer layer is formed, this photo-lacquer layer being exposed to a regular mask pattern with the use of a suitable source, this lacquer layer being developed, and in the inorganic layer the mask pattern is etched by a suitable etchant, thus forming the membrane layer. The pattern of the membrane layer may be given any particularly design, practically with a repetition rate in the range 0.1-10  mu m. It is thus conceivable to separate not only particles according to their size, but also to their shape. The membrane layer can be deposited very thinly in comparison to the dimension of the pore size, enabling a large flux, a reduced clogging and a minimal damage to particles or cells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inorganic membrane for 
microfiltration, that consists of a macroporous inorganic 
support and an inorganic membrane layer with pores having a 
pore size typically between 0.01 µm and 10 µm, which 
membrane layer is connected rigidly to the inorganic 
support. The invention relates also to a process for 
production of such an inorganic membrane. A membrane consisting of a macroporous support and a membrane 
layer is a composite membrane. The macroporous support 
contributes in here to the mechanical strength of the total 
membrane. Whenever the membrane layer with a high pore 
density is deposited relatively thin in comparison to the 
mean pore size on a relatively thick support a membrane 
with a high flux is obtained. In case the inorganic 
membrane layer as well as the inorganic support is made of 
suitable ceramic materials then the membrane will be 
chemically highly inert and will operate well at elevated 
temperatures. From EP-A-0-144 097 a composite ceramic membrane is known 
having above mentioned characteristics. Said ceramic 
membrane has a membrane layer that is formed by coating a 
porous support with a thin film by immersion in a stable 
sol of colloidal metal oxide (g -ALOOH) particles and then 
drying and heating the support, thus forming a microporous 
membrane layer of metal oxide particles. 
Such known inorganic membranes may display mechanical 
faults, like little fractures and 'pinholes' with typical  
 
size 10 µm to 100 µm, which are relatively large in 
comparison to the mean pore size, typically 5 nm - 5 µm, 
thus reducing the separating characteristics. Another intrinsic disadvantage of these membranes is the 
relatively large thickness of the membrane layer in 
comparison to the mean pore size, resulting in reduced flux 
characteristics of the membrane. In said patent publication 
the thickness of the membrane layer ranges from 50 to 1000 
times the mean pore size of the membrane layer. The present invention has as an object to provide an 
inorganic membrane with improved separating and flux 
characteristics. An other object is to provide an inorganic 
membrane particularly useful for biomedical filtration, in 
particular in solutions with vulnerable cells. Therefore, 
according to the invention an inorganic membrane for 
microfiltration is proposed, wherein the membrane consists 
of an inorganic macroporous support having a mean pore size 
in the range of 0.25µm-25µm, and an inorganic membrane 
layer being deposited and connected rigidly to
