carbonyl compound in the presence of a gas mixture of carbon 

monoxide and oxygen; 
iii) reacting the obtained rhodium carbonyl compound, without 
isolation from the reaction mixture, directly with a hydroxyl 

group-containing compound, an alkali metal hydroxide, 
formaldehyde and a triorganophosphorus ligand to prepare the 

hydridocarbonyl tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium; and

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the direct
preparation of hydridocarbonyl tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium
compounds from the rhodium complex catalyst-containing
distillation residue which is derived from the hydroformylation
reaction mixture containing a deactivated rhodium complex
catalyst. More specifically, the present invention pertains to
a process for direct preparation of hydridocarbonyl
tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium compounds in high yield starting
from the rhodium complex catalyst-containing distillation residue
of the hydroformylation reaction mixture, which is treated with
an oxidizing agent, which comprises the following three synthetic
steps: i) synthesis of a rhodium carbonyl compound; ii) preparation
of a hydridocarbonyl tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium complex;
and iii) post-treatment with carbon monoxide and hydrogen.Hydridocarbonyl tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium complex has
been widely used as a catalyst in numerous processes, for example,
hydrogen atom exchange reaction, isomerization, carbonylation
and hydroformylation of olefins. Particularly, it has
excellent catalytic activity and selectivity in hydroformylation
of olefins and thus has been widely used in commercial processes. In the prior art, hydridocarbonyl tris(triorganophosphorus)
rhodium compounds have been prepared according to several methods
starting from, for example, rhodium trichlorohydrate(RhCl3 · 3H2O),
halocarbonyl bis(triorganophosphorus)rhodium or spent rhodium
catalyst contained in the distillation residue of the hydroformylation
reaction mixture.According to the method using halocarbonyl bis(triorganophosphorus)rhodium
as a starting material, hydridocarbonyl
tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium can be prepared by reducing the
starting material with hydrazine in ethanol solvent as disclosed
in J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 3500, 1963 or by reacting chlorocarbonyl
bis(triphenylphosphine)rhodium with sodium tetrahydroborate
(NaBH4) or with a triethyl amine and hydrogen under an ethanol
solvent which contains an excessive triphenylphosphine, as
disclosed in Chem. Commun., 305, 1967.The method starting from rhodium trichlorohydrate can be
conducted by reacting rhodium trichlorohydrate with KOH and HCHO
under an ethanol solvent containing triphenylphosphine to obtain
hydridocarbonyl tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium in the yield of
94%, as disclosed in Inorg. Synth., 28, 81, 1990.In addition, hydridocarbonyl tris(triorganophosphorus)rhodium
compounds can be prepared by using the spent rhodium complex
catalyst
