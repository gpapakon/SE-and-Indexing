<ABSTRACT>
A serial access memory comprises a data transfer unit 
including a memory cell array (101) having a plurality of 

memory cells arranged therein for storing data, a first 
transfer register (117) electrically connected to the 

memory cell array through a first switching circuit (115) 
and a second transfer register (127) electrically 

connected to the first transfer register through a second 
switching circuit (125). When each of the first and 

second switching circuits (115, 125) is in an ON state, 
data passes through the first transfer register (117) so 

as to be transferred from the memory cell array (101) to 
the second transfer register (127), and when the first 

switching circuit is in an ON state and the second 
switching circuit is in an OFF state, data is transferred 

from the memory cell array to the first transfer register.

The invention relates to a serial access memory.EP-A-0 182 719 discloses a semiconductor memory device with shift registers which
includes a parallel data transfer circuit between the shift registers to enable high
speed reading and writing of data for a CRT display. EP-A-0 487 819 discloses a
video RAM which includes a serial access memory connected to bi-directional
random and serial ports, which permits parallel transfer of data between two serial
access memories. Serial access memories for use in filtering interlaced TV signals
have also been described in Japanese laid-open publication no. 64-59694, 7 March
1989 and Japanese laid-open publication no. 2-187989, 24 July 1990.According to the present invention, there is provided a serial access memory

circuits such that data from the memory cell array passes through said first register
so as to be transferred from said memory cell array to said second register when
said first switching circuit and said second switching circuit are in a switched on
state, and then data is transferred from said memory cell array to said first register
when said first switching circuit is in a switched on state and said second switching
circuit is in a switched off state.According to the present invention, there is also provided a method of transferring
data from a serial access memory, the serial access memory comprising a memory
cell array, a first register connected to the memory cell array through a first
switching circuit, and a second register connected to the first register through a
second switching circuit, characterised by switching the first and second switching
circuits on so that data from the memory cell array passes through the first register
to the second register, and then switching the first switching circuit on and 
switching the second switching circuit off so that data is transferred from said
memory cell array to the first register.Examples of the invention can provide a low-cost serial access memory which
occupies a reduced area on a silicon chip.Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
