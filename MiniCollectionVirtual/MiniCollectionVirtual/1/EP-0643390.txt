<ABSTRACT>
A recording medium cassette comprises a cassette case 
cassette case board and a release part. The cassette case board has 

a plurality of board terminals and also has positioning holes 
formed in its outer surface so as to expose the plurality of board 

terminals along with insertion guide channels formed 
consecutively at the lower ends of the positioning holes so as to 

reach the lower end of the cassette case. Also, a release part 
slopes towards the lower end of the insertion guide channel away 

from the outer surface. The angle of the release part with respect 
to the height of the cassette case is greater than the angle of an 

inclined portion, which spans from contact points to free end parts 
of resilient connector contacts set up at a recording/playback 

apparatus connector, with respect to the height of the cassette 
case, and the connector contacts do not come into contact with the 

release part when the recording medium cassette is installed in 
the recording/playback apparatus and the contacts are therefore 

brought together in a reliable manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to recording/playback apparatus and to a recording
medium cassette therefor.With recent recording medium cassettes such as, for example, tape cassettes,
items of information relating to the recording medium cassette, such as the recording
contents, the type of recording media and whether recording is not permissible etc.,
can be transmitted to recording/playback apparatus. Recording medium cassettes
have therefore been used where a number of terminals for transmitting each of these
various items of information to the recording/playback apparatus side are exposed
from the external 
surface of the cassette case, so that control of recording and
playback can be carried out in a way which is most appropriate for
this recording media cassette.However, one of the problems with using this kind of
recording medium cassette is that when it is installed in the
recording/playback apparatus, a prescribed part of the reading
means on the recording/playback apparatus side, for example, the
connector contacts, have to come securely into contact with a
prescribed terminal on the side of the recording medium cassette.Also, the recording medium cassette has a certain degree of
freedom within the mechanism, known as the loading mechanism,
for installing the recording medium cassette at a prescribed
position in the recording/playback apparatus i.e. it is held with a
certain amount of play to the right, left, forward and backward
directions and the final installation position is decided by a
position deciding mechanism.The play of the cassette recording medium within the loading
mechanism and the play in the direction of contact between the
terminals and the connector contacts does not present a problem.
However, shifts between the terminals and the connector contacts
and shifts in the vertical direction as these contact positions are
approached cause corresponding shifts in the position between the
terminals and the connector contacts, which creates serious
problems.Depending on this kind of position shift, a connector contact 
may fall into a terminal part which is not its corresponding terminal part and the
recording medium cassette may then be installed into its prescribed position without
modification. This means that the correct information concerning the recording media
cassette may not be transmitted to the recording/playback apparatus side. Also,
depending on the circumstances, the connector contacts may change shape if subjected
to an unreasonable amount of force, which may cause serious

<CLAIMS>
Recording/playback apparatus and a recording medium cassette comprising:

a cassette case (2); a cassette case board having a plurality of board terminals
(44) and disposed in the cassette case (2);
positioning holes (6) formed in an outer surface of the cassette case (2) so as
to expose the plurality of board terminals (44);
a plurality of insertion guide channels (7) formed in the outer surface aligned
at lower ends of the positioning holes (6) so as to reach a bottom edge (2a) of the

cassette case (2); and
a release part (7b) sloping towards lower ends of the insertion guide channels
(7) and sloping away from the outer surface of the cassette case (2);
wherein an angle (B) of the release part (7b) with respect to a height of the
cassette case (2) is greater than an angle (A) of an inclined portion (59). which

extends from contact points (58) provided at the free end parts (57) of resilient
connector contacts (55) formed in a connector (24) of the recording/playback

apparatus with respect to the height of the cassette case (2) so that the connector
contacts (55) do not come into contact with the release part (7b) when the recording

medium cassette is installed in the recording/playback apparatus.
Recording/playback apparatus and a recording medium cassette therefor
according to claim 1, further comprising an inclined guide surface (9) formed at

circumferences of the positioning holes (6) and the insertion guide channels (7) at the
outer surface of the cassette case (2) in such a manner as to guide the connector

contacts (55) to the positioning holes (6) and the insertion guide channels (7).
Recording/playback apparatus and a recording medium cassette therefor
according to claim 1, further comprising a step (6a) which defines the lower ends of

the positioning holes (6) and on which the lower end of the cassette case board (40)
rests, with a surface of the cassette case board (40) extruding outwards to a greater 

extent than a front end of the step (6a).
Recording/playback apparatus and a recording medium cassette therefor
according to claim 1, further comprising a reference hole (62) into which a reference

axis (61) for the recording playback apparatus is inserted formed in the vicinity of the
cassette case board (40) equipped with the board terminals (44) which extrude from

the positioning holes (6) at a lower part of the cassette case (2).
Recording/playback apparatus and a recording medium cassette therefor
according to claim 2, further comprising a step (6a) which defines the lower ends of

the positioning holes (6) and on which the lower end of the cassette case board (40)
rests, with a surface of the cassette case board (40) extruding outwards to a greater

extent than a front end of the step (6a).
Recording/playback apparatus and a recording medium cassette therefor
according to claim 5, further comprising a reference hole (62) into which a reference

axis (61) for the recording playback apparatus is inserted formed in the vicinity of the
cassette case board (40) equipped with the board terminals (44) which extrude from
