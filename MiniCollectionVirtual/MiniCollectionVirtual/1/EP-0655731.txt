<ABSTRACT>
In a noise suppressor capable of suppressing a 
noise signal before encoding or after decoding, a 

sequence of speech signals is rendered by the use of an 
inverse filter or a decoder into a sound source signal 

corresponding to the speech signal sequence. The noise 
signal is suppressed from the sound source signal by the 

use of feature parameters derived from the speech signal 
sequence. The noise signal can be suppressed within a 

speech duration and/or a non-speech duration by detecting 
the speech and the non-speech durations from the feature 

parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a noise suppressor for
use in suppressing a noise signal from a speech signal.As a rule, a speech signal is subjected to
pre-processing before the speech signal is encoded into a
sequence of encoded signals. For example, such
pre-processing has been made to judge either a speech
duration or a non-speech duration, in an article which is
contributed by J.F. Lynch, Jr. et al to IEEE and which is
entitled "SPEECH/SILENCE SEGMENTATION FOR REAL-TIME
CODING VIA RULE BASED ADAPTIVE ENDPOINT DETECTION"
(Proceedings ICASSP, pages 1348-1351, 1987). In the
article, description is made only about detection between
the speech duration and the non-speech duration but is
not made about suppressing a noise signal from the speech
signal during the pre-processing. In other words, Lynch
et al never consider about pre-processing which
suppresses the noise signal from the speech signal.
Practically, even when the pre-processing described in
the article is used for suppressing the noise signal from
the speech signal, it is difficult to suppress the noise
signal, namely, a non-speech signal within the speech 
duration.On the other hand, spectrum subtraction has been
proposed to remove a noise component from the speech
signal in
JP-A-2-278298. Thereafter, the speech
signal is encoded into a sequence of encoded signals.
With this method, only a noise spectrum which results
from the noise component is subtracted or removed from a
spectrum including the noise spectrum and produced as a
noise-subtracted speech signal. Thus, the
noise-subtracted speech signal might be free from the
noise component on the spectrum.However, it is to be noted that speech encoding
is usually carried out in connection not only with the
spectrum but also with a phase component of the speech
signal. This shows that a noise component can not be
removed which is included in the phase component in the
above-mentioned method.Therefore, the spectrum subtraction is
disadvantageous in that the noise component can not be
completely suppressed from the speech signal.Moreover, the spectrum subtraction can not be
applied on post-processing which is carried out after the
encoded signal sequence is decoded into a sequence of
decoded signals.At any rate, no consideration is made at all
about suppressing a noise component on post-processing,
despite that noise suppression is necessary after 
decoding.EP-A-459364 discloses a noise signal prediction system according to
the preamble of claim 1.It is an object of this invention to provide a
noise
