<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sliding contact bearing for running-gear components in motor vehicles. In this sliding contact bearing, a sliding contact layer (3) made of plastic and having lubricant pockets (2) on the outer circumference is moulded onto a metallic inner part (1) in a mould so as to adhere firmly, and an elastomer body (5) arranged in a metallic holding bush (4) encloses the inner part (1) with the sliding contact layer (3) in a manner which allows sliding movement. The circumference of the inner part (1) is provided with recesses (7), the lateral wall of which has a profile which is undercut in the direction of formation.

<CLAIMS>
Sliding bearing for chassis parts in motor vehicles, 
wherein a lining (3) made of plastic material and 

having lubricant pockets (2) on the outer lateral 
surface is injected in an adherent manner onto a metal 

inner part (1) in a mould and an elastomeric body (5) 
disposed in a metal receiving bush (4) encloses the 

inner part (1) with the lining (3) in a slidingly 
movable manner, characterized in that provided on the 

periphery of the inner part (1) are recesses (7), which 
in cross section have an, at least at one side, 

dovetailed shape and the side wall of which has a shape 
which is undercut in the direction of removal from the 

mould. 
Sliding bearing according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the recesses (7) take the form of longitudinal 

grooves extending in an axial direction of the bearing 
and transverse grooves extending in a peripheral 

direction. 
Sliding bearing according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the recesses (7) on the outer 

periphery of the inner part (1) and the ribs or the 
like lying between the lubricant pockets (2) on the 

outer periphery of the elastomeric body (3) are 
disposed offset relative to one another by way of 

adaptation to the operating loads.
