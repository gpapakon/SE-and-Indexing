<ABSTRACT>
In a solid article conveyor, guide grooves (102a) 
and pockets (101a) are formed in a manner so that one width 

(WD, WG) of each guide groove (102a) and pocket (101a) is 
made narrower than the largest dimension of the solid 

article (100). Thus, only one solid article (100) can be 
contained in each pocket (101a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improvement of a solid 
article conveyor for arranging solid articles such as 
tablets, capsules and the like, which are contained in a 
hopper at random, and for conveying the arranged solid 
articles to a printer, a PTP packer and the like. For example, Publication Gazette of Unexamined 
Japanese Patent Application Sho 61-10457 describes a 
conventional solid article conveyor where solid articles 
such as the tablets, capsules and the like are regularly 
arranged in pockets which are formed on an outer surface of 
a drum and the solid articles are conveyed to a process such 
as printing, PTP packaging and the like. In the conventional solid article conveyor, numerous 
pockets are formed on an outer surface of a feeding drum. 
Each pocket generally has a depth shallower than the largest 
dimension (diameter) of a solid article in a radial 
direction perpendicular to a rotation axis of the drum, and 
has a sectional area wider than the largest sectional area 
of the solid article in a direction parallel to the rotation 
axis of the drum. Thus, the solid article is contained in 
the pocket in a manner so that a section where the solid 
article has the largest sectional area becomes parallel to 
the rotation axis of the drum, in a normal operation (not  
 
shown in the figure). Troublesome cases of conveyance of the solid 
articles in the conventional solid article conveyor are shown 
in FIG.4. As shown in FIG.4, the pockets 2a to 2d formed on 
the drum 1 have a depth shallower than the largest dimension 
of the solid articles 100a to 100d in the radial direction 
of the drum 1, and have a sectional area wider than the 
largest sectional area of the solid articles 100a to 100d in 
the direction parallel to 
the rotation axis of the drum 1. Thus, it is possible that 
the solid articles 100a to 100d are not normally contained 
within the pockets 2a to 2d. For example, in the pocket 2a, a 
plurality of (two) solid articles 100a are contained in one 
pocket, and the solid articles 100a are upright. In the pocket 
2b, the solid article 100b rests on the edge of the pocket 
2b. In the pocket 2c, the solid article 100c is not placed 
at the normal position in the pocket 2c. In the pocket 2d, 
the solid article 100d is standing, similar to those in the 
pocket 2a. Thus, the solid articles 100a to 100d protrude 
from the pockets 2a to 2d. If the solid articles 100a to 100d, which are 
abnormally contained in the pockets 2a to 2d, are conveyed 
to a process such as printing, PTP
