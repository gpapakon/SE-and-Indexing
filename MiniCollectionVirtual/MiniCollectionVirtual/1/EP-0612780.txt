<ABSTRACT>
Poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) is produced by ring-opening 
polymerization of ß-butyrolactone in the presence of at least one 

tin compound selected from distannoxane derivatives (e.g., 1-chloro-3-ethoxy-1,1,3,3-tetrabutyldistannoxane),tincarboxylate 
compounds (e.g., tin dioctanoate), and di-lower alkyltin oxides 

(e.g., dibutyltin oxide). Poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) can be 
produced in high yield at low cost through simple production 

steps. The resulting polymer has an increased molecular weight 
not previously attained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing
poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) useful as a functional polymeric
material. More particularly, it relates to a process for
producing poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) by ring-opening
polymerization of β-butyrolactone in the presence of a
specific tin compound as defined in claim 1, in the absence of a polymerization
initiator.Many microorganisms which accumulate poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyric
acid) in microbial cells are known (see
P.A. Holmes, Phys. Technol., Vol. 16, pp. 32-36 (1985) and
Yoshiharu Doi, SEIBUNKAISEI KOBUNSHI ZAIRYO, pp. 26-30, Kogyo
Chosakai (1990)). This polymer is a thermoplastic resin
having biodegradability, i.e., enzymatic decomposability,
hydrolyzability, and biocompatibility, and is now attracting
attention as a functional polymeric material. For example,
it is widely applicable as a clean plastic causing no
environmental pollution, taking advantage of its
degradability by microorganisms in soil or water (see
Yoshiharu Doi, SEIBUNKAISEI KOBUNSHI ZAIRYO, pp. 19-26, Kogyo
Chosakai (1990)).Various biological or chemical processes for
synthesizing poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) on an industrial scale 
have hitherto been proposed. For example, known biological
processes include a process of utilizing Azotobacter
vinelandii as disclosed in JP-A-60-251889 (the term "JP-A" as
used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent
application"). However, biological synthesis of a polymer
requires complicated steps for separation of the accumulated
polymer from microbial cells, resulting in increased
production cost. Besides, the resultant polymer obtained has
a specific steric configuration at an optical purity of 100%,
i.e., is an (R)-polymer. Such a polymer has a melting point as
high as 180°C and is therefore difficult to handle as
reported in Yoshiharu Doi, ibid, p. 26.On the other hand, it is known that poly(3-hydroxybutyric
acid) is produced by ring-opening
polymerization of β-butyrolactone. Examples of this chemical
process include a process of using a triethylaluminum/water
catalyst system (see Richard A. Gross, et al.,
Macromolecules, Vol. 21, pp. 2657-2668 (1988)), a process of
using a diethylzinc/water catalyst system (see Y. Zhang, et
al., Macromolecules, Vol. 23, pp. 3206-3212 (1990) and N.
Tanahashi, et al., Macromolecules, Vol. 24, pp. 5732-5733
(1991)), a process of using an aluminum-porphyrin complex as
a catalyst (see S. Asano, et al., Macromolecules, Vol. 18,
pp. 2057-2061 (1985)), a process of using a potassium
solution or other
