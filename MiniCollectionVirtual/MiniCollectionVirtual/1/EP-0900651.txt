<ABSTRACT>
Laminates are produced by bonding substrates of large area with an aqueous adhesive dispersion of a polymer of 5-95 wt.% 4C alkyl acrylate, 5-95 wt.% 1 or 2C alkyl acrylate and optionally other monomer(s). The other monomers are 0-50 wt.% primary monomers, selected from 1-2C alkyl methacrylate, 4C alkyl methacrylates, 3 and 5-16C alkyl (meth)acrylates, vinyl aromatics and ester esters of carboxylic acids containing â‰¤ 20C; 0-20 wt.% secondary monomers, selected from ethylenically unsaturated acids, anhydrides, nitriles, amides and hydroxyl compounds; and 0-20 wt.% other monomers. An Independent claim is also included for (a) the production of the laminates by bonding with this adhesive.

<CLAIMS>
A process for bonding paper with transparent polymer films or
for bonding card with transparent polymer films, which

comprises using as adhesive an aqueous dispersion of a
polymer built up from


from 5 to 95% by weight
of a C
4
-alkyl acrylate
from 5 to 95% by weight
of a C
1
- or C
2
-alkyl acrylate,
from 0 to 50% by weight
of a monomer termed a main monomer
and selected from the class

consisting of C
1
-C
2
-alkyl
methacrylates, C
4
-alkyl methacrylates,
C
3
-alkyl and C
5
-C
16
-alkyl acrylates or
-alkyl methacrylates, vinylaromatics

and vinyl esters of carboxylic acids
containing up to 20 carbon atoms,
from 0 to 20% by weight
of monomers termed secondary monomers
selected from the class consisting of

ethylenically unsaturated acids,
anhydrides and ethylenically

unsaturated nitriles, or that
consisting of amides and

ethylenically unsaturated compounds
with a hydroxyl group, and
from 0 to 20% by weight
of other monomers.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polymer is built
up from


from 15 to 85% by weight
of a C
4
-alkyl acrylate
from 15 to 85% by weight
of a C
1
- or C
2
-alkyl acrylate, 
from 0 to 30% by weight
of a main monomer,
from 0 to 10% by weight
of a secondary monomer and
from 0 to 10% by weight
of another monomer.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the adhesive is
a single-component system which does not need a crosslinking

agent for the polymer.
A laminate obtainable by a process as claimed in any of
claims 1 to 3.
