<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a polyurethane foam, which comprises 
reacting a polyol component containing a benzylic ether type 

phenolic resin having hydroxymethyl groups with an organic polyisocyanate 
component in the presence of an organotin type urethanization 

catalyst, a tertiary amine type blowing catalyst and water. 
Said process is free from the problems of the prior art; uses 
no fluorine-containing halogenated hydrocarbon as a blowing agent; and 

yet enables in-situ production of polyurethane foam by the use of a 
spray foaming machine in any season of the year.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a polyurethane
foam. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for producing a
polyurethane foam, which uses no blowing agent such as fluorine-containing halogenated
hydrocarbon and yet enables in-situ production of polyurethane foam by
the use of, for example, a spray foaming machine.Rigid polyurethanes have been applied to buildings by in-situ spray
foaming, for the purpose of the moisture condensation prevention and heat insulation
of said buildings. The foaming solutions heretofore used for production of
polyurethane foam contain a fluorine-containing halogenated hydrocarbon as a
blowing agent in an amount of about 15-40% by weight based on the foaming solution.Patent document U.S. 4,448,951 discloses a process for the formation of
polyurethane foams which are synthesized by reaction of modified benzyl ether-containing
resole polyols with organic polyisocyanates. Water or volatile low boiling
organic compounds, such as alkanes, oxygenated compounds or halogenated aliphatic
compounds, such as fluorotrichlormethane or methylene dichlorid, or mixtures
thereof are used as blowing agents in this process. The synthesis of high
density polyurethane foams for game balls is described in U.S. patent 4,454,253.
The formation of these high density polyurethane foams, which are particularly suitable
for use in sports, is based on the reaction of hydroxyl-terminated liquid diene
polymers with polyisocyanates in the presence of a tin and a tertiary amine catalyst
using water or low boiling hydrocarbons such as dichlorodifluoromethane or dichlorofluoroethane
as blowing agents.The use of the fluorine-containing halogenated hydrocarbon, however, is
said to be totally banned in near future in connection with the problem of ozone
layer destruction. Water is being investigated as a substitute for the fluorine-containing
halogenated hydrocarbon. In using such a substitute blowing agent to achieve the
same free rise density (e.g. 20 kg/m3) as obtained with conventional blowing
agents, about 40% of an isocyanate component used together with a polyol component
is consumed for the formation of urea bond, inviting reduction in physical
properties of foam obtained, such as reduction in adhesivity and occurrence of fragility.Further, in using water as a blowing agent, there arises two-step 
foaming owing to the difference between (1) the reaction rate between
isocyanate component and polyol component and (2) the reaction
rate between isocyanate
