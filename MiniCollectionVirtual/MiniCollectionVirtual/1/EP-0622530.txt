<ABSTRACT>
In an exhaust gas purifying apparatus including 
first (16) and second (17) exhaust converters composed of a 

honeycomb catalytic substrate, arranged in sequence from 
an exhaust manifold towards downstream exhaust gas flow 

of an engine (1), wherein the catalytic substrate of the 
first converter (16) has a heat capacity of not exceeding 0.5 

J/K per 1 cm³ in temperatures ranging from room 
temperature up to 300°C, and the catalytic substrate of 

the second converter (17) has a geometric surface area of at 
least 25 cm²/cm³. The first converter (16) purifies exhaust 

gas immediately after starting up and before completion 
of warming up of the engine (1), and the second converter (17) 

further purifies noxious contents still remaining as 
being beyond capacity of the first converter (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to exhaust gas purifying apparatuses for internal combustion engines (hereinafter
referred to as "engines") to be used in automobiles or the like.Regulations for exhaust gas of automobiles are becoming stricter year by year Particularly, it is becoming more
and more severely requested to decrease noxious contents in exhaust gas, such as carbon monoxide CO, hydrocarbons
HC, nitrogen oxides NOx or the like, by purifying the exhaust gas discharged immediately after starting up and
before completion of warming up of engines. As a countermeasure therefor, there has been known an exhaust gas
purifying apparatus to be mounted on the exhaust port of the engine, which comprises a first exhaust converter having
a small capacity and a second exhaust converter having a large capacity, for converting the noxious contents into
innoxious components. In such an exhaust gas purifying apparatus, the noxious contents are decreased by the first
exhaust converter wherein a high temperature is readily attained and thereby a catalyst is rapidly activated, mainly
immediately after starting up and before completion of warming up of the engine and then by the second exhaust
converter having a larger capacity after the warming up of the engine has been completed. Among these exhaust gas
purifying apparatuses, some have been so designed as to feed air at an appropnate feed rate into exhaust gas to
improve an exhaust gas purification efficiency.Examples of exhaust systems having two honeycomb catalyst supports in series are shown in JP-A-89-0341379
and FR-A-2 367 188.However, in the above-mentioned exhaust gas purifying apparatus there has been posed a problem such that
since the first exhaust converter comprises a catalytic substrate having a heat capacity not small enough to sufficiently
activate the catalyst while the engine is under the condition between immediately after starting up and before completion
of warming up, a good exhaust gas purification efficiency cannot be obtained. In this specification, the term "heat
capacity" is meant by a heat capacity of a catalytic substrate including exhaust flow passages formed therein (hereinafter,
the exhaust flow passage is referred to as "cell").The present invention which has been accomplished in order to solve such a problem is aimed to thoroughly
remove noxious contents in exhaust gas, such as carbon monoxide CO, hydrocarbons HC, nitrogen oxides NOx or the
like, by converting these into innoxious components immediately after starting up and before
