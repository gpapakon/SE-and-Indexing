 PESCRIPTION SUSTAINED RELEASE COMPOSITION AND METHOD UTILZING XANTHAN GUM AND AN ACTIVE INGREDIENTTechnical FieldThis invention relates to a composition and method of manufacture and use in which xanthan gum is combined with an active pharmaceutical or other ingredient in a compacted dose form for delivering the active ingredient to the gastro-intestinal tract over a sustained period.Background ArtSustained or slow release compositions containing pharmaceutical medications or other active ingredients are designed to contain higher concentrations of the medicament or ingredient and are prepared in such a manner as to effect sustained or slow release into the gastro-intestinal digestive tract of humans or animals over an extended period of time. Well absorbed oral sustained or slow release therapeutic drug dosage forms have inherent advantages over conventional, immediate release dosage forms. The advantages include less frequent dosing of a medicament and resultant patient regime compliance, a more sustained drug blood level response, the possibility of effecting therapeutic action with less ingested drug, and the mitigation of side effects. By providing a slow and steady release of the medicament over time, absorbed drug concentration spikes are mitigated or eliminated by effecting a smoother and more sustained blood level response. Many therapeutic agents, medicaments, or other active ingredients have a wide window for absorption, meaning that the drug has been demonstrated to be well absorbed along the entire digest tract. Such agents, medicaments, or other active ingredients are then logical candidates for possible dosage as a sustained or slow release medication. Sustained or slow release therapeutic dose forms are based on many and varied principles. For example, one of the techniques of preparation involves formation of the drug in generally spherical pellet form wherein a specific quantity of pellets are set aside for immediate release and the remaining drug pellets or spheres are coated with various thicknesses of a suitable fat, or resinous, or fatty resinous like coating. When fractions of the pellets are blended together and then filled into capsules or pressed into tablets, without destroying the integrity of the coatings, suitable slow or sustained release dose forms may be effected. Another 

technique is to admix the therapeutic agent with fats and solid polyhydric alcohols, such as polyoxyethylene glycol, and/or a solid surfactant, such as polyoxyethylene glycol distearate, and press

 Claims
1. A compacted sustained release composition for delivering a drug as an active ingredient to the gastro-intestinal tract comprising an effective amount of said active ingredient in mixture with xanthan gum, said active ingredient comprising in excess of 40 percent by weight of the total of said active ingredient and said xanthan gum, the mixture being in the form of a unit dose in capsule or tablet form.
2. The composition of claim 1 wherein said xanthan gum comprises no more than 60% by weight of the total of said active ingredient and said xanthan gum.
3. The composition of claim 1 wherein said active ingredient is niacin.
4. The composition of claim 1 wherein said active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of analgesics, antipyretics, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, electrolyte replenishers, decongestants, antihistamines, and useful bacteriological organisms for the gastro-intestinal tract
5. The composition of claim 1 wherein said unit dose comprises a major amount by weight of niacin and a minor amount of xanthan gum.
6. The composition of claim 1 further including a water soluble, carbohydrate-based agglomerate.
7. The composition of claim 1 consisting essentially of said active ingredient and said xanthan gum.
8. A method of producing a compacted sustained release composition for delivering a drug as an active ingredient to the gastro-intestinal tract comprising mixing an effective amount of said active ingredient with xanthan gum, said active ingredient comprising in excess of 40 percent by weight of the total of said active ingredient and said xanthan gum, and forming the mixture in a unit dose in capsule or tablet form. 


9. The method of claim 8 wherein said xanthan gum comprises no more than 60% by weight of the total of said active ingredient and said xanthan gum.
10. The method of claim 8 wherein said active ingredient is niacin.
1 1. The method of claim 8 wherein said active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of analgesics, antipyretics, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, electrolyte replenishers, decongestants, antihistamines, and useful bacteriological organisms for the gastro-intestinal tract.
12. The method of claim 8 wherein said composition comprises a major amount by weight of niacin and a minor amount of xanthan gum.
13. The method of claim 8 further including combining said active ingredient with a water soluble, carbohydrate-based agglomerate prior to mixing with said xanthan gum.
14. The method of claim 8 wherein said composition consists essentially of said active ingredient and said xanthan gum.
15. A compacted sustained release composition for delivering a drug as an active ingredient to the gastro-intestinal tract comprising an effective amount of said active ingredient in mixture with xanthan gum, said active ingredient being selected from the group consisting of analgesics, antipyretics, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, electrolyte replenishers, decongestants, antihistamines, and useful bacteriological organisms for the gastro-intestinal tract, the mixture being in the form of a unit dose in capsule or tablet form.
16. The composition of claim 15 wherein said active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of aspirin, acetamenophen, ibuprofen, pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12), calcium ascorbate, chlorpheniramine maleate, potassium chloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and lactobacillus acidophyllus. 


17. The composition of claim 15 wherein said active ingredient comprises in excess of 40 percent and said xanthan gum comprises no more than 60 percent by weight of the total of active ingredient and xanthan gum.
18. A method of producing a compacted sustained release composition for delivering a drug as an active ingredient to the gastro-intestinal tract comprising mixing an effective amount of said active ingredient with xanthan gum, said active ingredient being selected from the group consisting of analgesics, antipyretics, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, electrolyte replenishers, decongestants, antihistamines, and useful bacteriological organisms for the gastro-intestinal tract, and forming the mixture in a unit dose in capsule or tablet form.
19. The method of claim 18 wherein said active ingredient is selected from the group consisting of aspirin, acetamenophen, ibuprofen, pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) hydrochloride, cyanocobalamin (vitamin B-12), calcium ascorbate, chlorpheniramine maleate, potassium chloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and lactobacillus acidophyllus.
20. The method of claim 18 wherein said active ingredient comprises in excess of 40 percent and said xanthan gum comprises no more than 60 percent by weight of the total of active ingredient and xanthan gum.
