<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus with braker, contactor, or reversing switch operation. This apparatus (10) comprises an electromagnet (12) with a pivoting blade (22), a control mechanism (13) and a tilting contact (15) arranged to interact with at least one fixed contact (14). The control mechanism (13) includes a bell crank (24) pivoting on a fixed spindle (26) and interacting with a control arm (18) secured to the tilting contact (15). A link rod (25) provides the link between the blade (22) and the bell crank (24). It is articulated to the bell crank at a point (25a) or at a point (25b) according to the use of the apparatus, these two points being situated on either side of the fixed spindle (26). This apparatus is advantageous because it is of simple, economic and reliable construction.

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus operating as a disconnector, a contactor or a changeover switch,
comprising a case housing :


an electromagnet with a remote-control pivoting blade,
an operating mechanism comprising a rocker arm pivoting around a fixed spindle
and able to occupy two extreme positions,
a control device coupled to the blade and cooperating with the rocker arm to move
the latter from one stable position to the other stable position at each operating

cycle of the blade,
a bistable rocking contact associated to at least one stationary contact and which is
securedly affixed to a contact arm which cooperates with said rocker arm to move

said rocking contact from one state to the other and vice-versa when the rocker
arm switches from one of the positions to the other,
at least two terminals arranged on faces of the case, one of which is connected to
the stationary contact and the other to the rocking contact by a rigid conductor one

end of which defines an articulation of the rocking contact,

characterized in that said control device (13) comprises a connecting rod (25)
articulated at one of its ends on the blade (22) and at its other end on the rocker arm

(24), the articulation point (25a or 25b) on the rocker arm (24) being able to be moved
to at least two distinct locations situated on each side of the fixed spindle of said

rocker arm, depending on whether the apparatus is used as a disconnector, a
contactor or a changeover switch.
The apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a spiral
spring (30) provided with end branches (30a and 30b) one of which presses against

the end of the connecting rod (25) at its attachment point with the rocker arm (24) and
the other of which presses against a fixed stop (30c).
