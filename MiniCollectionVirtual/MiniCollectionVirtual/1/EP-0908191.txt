<ABSTRACT>
A hollow fiber membrane oxygenator of external blood circulation
type 1 has a housing 2 and a lot of porous hollow fiber membranes 3 for

gas transfer housed in the housing 2. In the oxygenator 1, blood flows
along the outer side of the hollow fiber membranes 3, whereas oxygen-containing

gas flows along the inner side thereof. An outer surface or
outer layer 3a of the hollow fiber membrane 3 as a blood-contacting

portion is coated with synthetic polymer 18 mainly formed of
alkoxyalkyl(meta)acrylate containing a C(1-4)alkoxy group and a C(1-4)alkyl

group. An intermediate layer 3b and inner layer 3c of the hollow
fiber membranes 3 contain substantially no synthetic polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hollow fiber membrane
oxygenator for removing carbon dioxide from blood and oxygenating the
blood in an extracorporeal blood circulation and, more particularly, to the
hollow fiber membrane oxygenator of external blood circulation type.A generally employed hollow fiber membrane oxygenator using
porous membrane has been widely applied to a device for extracorporeal
blood circulation, a device for assisting cardiopulmonary blood
circulation and the like used in cardiotomy operated for cardiopathy.
The membrane type oxygenator is composed mainly of hollow fiber
membranes through which gas is transferred, i.e., oxygen is admitted into
blood and carbon dioxide is removed from blood.Two methods of blood circulation to the membrane type
oxygenator can be used, one is an internal perfusion method and the
other is an external perfusion method. The former method allows blood
to flow to the inner side of the hollow fiber membranes and gas to flow to
the outer side thereof. The latter method allows blood to flow to the
outer side of the hollow fiber membranes and gas to flow to the inner side
thereof.The membrane type oxygenator of external perfusion type has
become more popular than that of internal perfusion type because of
higher mass transfer capability and lower degree of pressure loss. The
aforementioned membrane type oxygenator of external perfusion type,
however, tends to cause turbulence in the blood flow, which is likely to
adversely affect adhesion and activation characteristics of blood platelet.
In view of the above-described aspect, the oxygenator of internal 
perfusion type may be considered to be superior to the external perfusion
type.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 62-172961 discloses a
membrane type oxygenator coated with benzylalkylammonium-heparin
composite. This oxygenator, however, causes exfoliation of the
composite into blood during its operation.The above-described oxygenator may be coated with hydrophilic
polymer. In such a case, when using porous membranes for gas transfer,
the blood plasma component will penetrate into micropores and leak
through the membrane, thus degrading gas transfer capability.Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-152952 discloses biocompatible
material formed of alkoxyalkyl(meth)acrylate, which can be
applied to the membrane of the membrane type oxygenator. However it
is practically difficult to form the hollow fiber membrane for the
membrane type oxygenator directly from the alkoxyalkyl(meth)acrylate.
