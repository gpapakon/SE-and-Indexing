<ABSTRACT>
A process for stably producing a dried product of α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine 
methyl ester with controlled water content is developed. 
Wet crystals of α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester obtained 
by crystallization are subjected to a drying step to adjust the water 

content to not more than 5 % (wet basis), subsequently passing a gas 
adjusted to the temperature at 20 - 80 °C and relative humidity of 20 - 

90 RH% in contact with the dried crystals to control their water content.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a significantly improved process for
producing α-L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (hereinafter
referred to as α-APM).α-APM is expected to be widely utilized as a low caloric dietary
sweetener which is about 200 times as sweet as sugar.The final product α-APM is generally in the form of dried powder
or granule. Processes for producing granules include, for example, a
method wherein wet extrusion granulation is carried out before drying
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 95862-1984), a method
wherein dry compression granulation is carried out after drying (Japanese
Patent Publication No. 15268-1989). Various means for drying such as
flush drying, fluidized drying, drying under reduced pressure may be
employed.EP-A-256 515 discloses a method for drying AMP crystals using a gas having a defined humidity.EP-A 255 092 discloses a method for drying AMP crystals involving different temperatures.The water content of α-APM after drying is desirably not more
than 5% (% hereinafter used means that on wet basis), considering
adhesion to the apparatus or wall of the pipe during subsequent 
transporting and packaging steps. However, the particular value may
considerably vary depending on means and conditions of drying. Drying
steps conducted under the same drying conditions may often provide
dried products with different water content. For example, when the wet
crystal cake obtained by crystallization is crushed and subjected to
fluidized drying, it is inevitable that the wet crystal cake is unevenly
crushed and unevenly dried depending on the unevenness of crushing,
providing a variation of the water content of about 1 - 2 % in the final
dried product. To avoid such problems, multi-step crushing and grinding
of the crystals may be conducted as the drying degree proceeds so that
the crystals should be uniformly dried to have a water content around the
desired value. However, determination of conditions and conducting
such multi-step operations are often very complicated.Moreover, the water content of the dried product is known to vary
considerably depending on the heat load, i.e., the amount of the wet
crystals to be dried. For example, when wet crystals of α-APM with a
water content of 25 % are continuously flush dried using hot air at
170 °C, the amount of the supplied wet crystals is reduced to half for
convenience of the preceding step. As the result, we found that the water
content of the dried product is significantly reduced, i.e., from about 3.5
to about 1.6 %.Such
