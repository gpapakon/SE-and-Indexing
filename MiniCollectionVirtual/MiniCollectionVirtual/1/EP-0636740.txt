<ABSTRACT>
A cellulose preparation which can improve the color and hand of cellulosic fibers while suppressing a lowering 
in the strengths of the fibers. The cellulose of the preparation can adsorb crystalline cellulose and has an avicellase 

activity to CMCase activity ratio of 0.1 or above. The fibers treated with this preparation can retain a relative residual 
tensile strength of at least 75 % per count at a weight reduction rate of 5 %.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to enzyme preparations 
comprising cellulase, i.e., cellulase preparations, and a 
method for treating cellulosic fibers using the same. More 
particularly, the present invention is concerned with 
cellulase preparations which can improve color and feeling of 
cellulosic fibers while preventing a lowering in strength of 
the cellulosic fibers. It is widely known that treatment of cellulosic fibers 
with an aqueous solution containing cellulase can improve 
color, feeling and other various properties of the cellulosic 
fibers. This treatment is called "loss in weight treatment," 
or "stone-free stone-washed process". Moreover, the cellulosic 
fibers, which have been subjected to the above treatment, is 
called "stone-washed denim like fibers." For example, preparations for the treatment are 
proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 174298/1987, 
8287/1992 and 500702/1992, and methods for the treatment are 
proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 185775/1992, 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 19235/1990, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Nos. 80680/1990, 167378/1991 and 80673/1990, 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 13471/1992, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Nos. 167366/1991, 241076/1991 and 241077/1991 and 
Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 20751/1990 and 13470/1992. In general, however, it is pointed out that the 
treatment of the cellulosic fibers with cellulase unfavorably 
lowers the strength of the cellulosic fibers. In order to prevent the lowering in strength of the 
cellulosic fibers, a proposal has been made, for example, on a 
method for shortening the treatment time (Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 48236/1977). So far as the present inventors  
 
know, however, this method is unsatisfactory in the 
improvement in properties of the fiber although it can prevent 
the lowering in strength of the fiber. Further, various methods have been proposed for 
preventing the lowering in fiber strength. Examples of such 
methods known in the art include a method for carrying out a 
chemical pretreatment (for example, Japanese Patent 
Publication Nos. 23591/1989 and 40787/1990, Japanese Patent 
Laid-Open Nos. 216282/1990, 51376/1991 and 99084/1985), a 
method in which a resin or a salt is allowed to exist together 
with cellulase (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
216283/1990 and 50380/1992), a method in which a chemical post 
treatment is carried out (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. 50365/1992), a method in which a pretreatment is 
carried out using plasma (for
