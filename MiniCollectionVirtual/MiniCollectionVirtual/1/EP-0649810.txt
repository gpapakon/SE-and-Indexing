<ABSTRACT>
A sensed force signal is averaged over a plurality 
of trips under differing load conditions and the average 

is pre-stored for retrieval at various vertical points 
in the hoistway and may be used, in combination with a 

feedback loop, to predict horizontal forces about to act 
on the car 30.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to elevators and, more 
particularly, to improved ride quality. U.S. Patent 4,750,590 to Otala shows an open-loop 
elevator control system with solenoid actuated guide 
shoes. The disclosure suggests using the concept of 
first ascertaining the out-of-straightness of the guide 
rails for storage in a computer memory and subsequently 
controlling the guide shoes by recalling the corresponding 
information from memory and correcting the guide rail 
shoe positions accordingly. Kokai 3-51281 of Kagami is similar to Otala except 
is additionally concerned with a supposed variable stiffness 
of the rails along with an eccentric load causing 
difficulties in truly learning the rail. See also Kokai 
3-23185, 3-51280 and 3-115076 for similar disclosures. 
Kokai 3-124683 shows apparatus for measuring the mounting 
accuracy of a guide rail by sensing the position of the 
car relative to a piano wire and a rail. Kokai 60-36279 discloses an electromagnet guide in a 
closed loop control based on position and current feedback. 
The text that explains Fig. 8 seems to suggest 
memorizing rail displacement error.  U.S. Patent 4,754,849 to Ando and Kokai 58-39753 
show electromagnet guides using a vertical wire as a 
positional reference. U.S. Patent 5,027,925 shows a procedure for damping 
the vibrations of an elevator car supported by elastic 
suspension elements and controlling a vibration damper in 
parallel with the elastic suspension elements with the 
output of an acceleration sensor. See also Kokai 
61-22675 for a disclosure of variable coulomb-damping in 
parallel to the car top hitch springs which carry the 
rope loads suspending the crosshead. See also Kokai 60-15374 
for a similar device for controlling vertical 
vibrations using an accelerometer in Fig. 11. Various 
other patent documents disclose acceleration-based, 
closed-loop "active" suspensions for automobiles, railroad 
cars, military tanks, etc. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 
4,809,179; 4,892,328 and 4,898,257. Similarly, a real 
time simulation was used to analyze two idealized MAGLEV 
suspensions: an attraction (ferromagnetic) system and a 
repulsion (cryogenic) system in "Performance of Magnetic 
Suspension for High-speed Vehicles" by C. A. Skalski, 
published in the June 1974 Journal of Dynamic Systems, 
Measurement and Control. Fig. 8 thereof shows an 
accelerometer connected to an integrator. An active horizontal suspension is disclosed in 
United Kingdom Patent Application GB 2 238 404 A, having 
pressure applied to the guide

<CLAIMS>
A method for predicting horizontal 
disturbances of an elevator car caused by hoistway rail 

anomalies comprising the steps of: 
   repeatedly causing said car to move vertically 

along said rail under varying load conditions in a 
plurality of trips; 

   for each of said trips, sensing a parameter 
indicative of said horizontal disturbances at selected 

vertical points along said hoistway, as indicated by a 
vertical position signal, and providing sensed signals 

having magnitudes indicative thereof; 
   for each selected vertical point, averaging said 

stored signals, for providing an average parameter 
signal having a magnitude indicative thereof; and 

   storing, for each selected vertical position in 
said hoistway, said average parameter signal. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said parameter 
is an average horizontal force. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said parameter 
is a horizontal position of said elevator. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said parameter 
is a horizontal position of said elevator multiplied by 

a spring rate.
