<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for thermal surface
treatment in a continuous casting machine and also concerns
a device suitable to carry out this method, as set forth in
the main claims. The method and relative device according
to the invention are employed in the metallurgical field and
in particular on continuous casting machines to perform
continuous controlled cooling of the bloom being fed.The invention is applied to the treatment of blooms,
billets or slabs having a square, round, rectangular or
polygonal cross-section and consisting of fine-grain
structural steels.In the description that follows, we shall use only the
word "blooms" for descriptive convenience but shall mean
thereby that the device is applied also to billets and slabs
having any of the above cross-sections.The invention is applied advantageously, but not only, to
the treatment of the following families of steels: steels
for structural uses, steels for cold processing, steels for
forging, steels for cementation, hardening and tempering
steels and surface hardening steels.Moreover the invention is applied in particular to steels
having an appreciable content of aluminium.Continuous casting plants use the technique of carrying
out a quenching operation on moving blooms before the blooms
are fed into a furnace with a hot charge.The quenching operation in continuous casting plants is
performed downstream of the shearing assembly consisting,
for instance, of a shears or oxygen-cutting torches,
depending on the thickness of the bloom; this shearing
assembly is installed downstream of the extraction and 
straightening segment of the plant.The quenching operation, however, entails a series of
drawbacks linked to the fact that the bloom arriving at the
quenching station has too low a temperature.Moreover, in the plants of the state of the art, when the
quenching operation is carried out on the sheared bloom,
there is a considerable difference of temperature between
its two ends, and this difference of temperature results in
a lack of structural homogeneity with consequent faults in
the bloom and/or problems in the plant downstream.There is also the method of cooling the blooms in air,
which is advantageously a forced draught at a temperature
below 600°C, so as to cause conversion of the austenite in
their surface layer before charging them into the furnace.This entails in practice a cooling of the bloom, which
reduces a great deal of the energy saving linked to the hot
charging process.The state of the art includes an auxiliary cooling
