<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to door-type thrust reversers for aircraft jet engines. The door (2) is equipped, on the internal face of its upstream end, with at least one auxiliary flap (8) articulated to the door and capable of being brought from a position remote from the internal face of the door into a position against the latter, and locked in each one of these positions by virtue of an operating device with linkages (12, 17, 21, 19). The operating device is actuated by virtue of its interaction with a fixed limit stop (23). Locking the flap (8) in each one of its positions avoids vibration thereof and damage thereto.

A thrust reverser for a jet aircraft engine
including a fairing (1) surrounding the engine unit and

together with the latter forming an annular duct (C) for
the flow of the gases, said reverser being made up of a

series of doors (2) which are articulated to the fairing so
that they can move between a thrust-reversal position in

which the doors (2) are deployed so as to free, in the
fairing, openings (3) for diverting the gases while at

least partially closing off the annular duct (C), and a
cruise position in which the doors (2) are stowed so as to

close the diversion openings (3) and constitute part of the
fairing, said doors (2) being equipped on the upstream part

of their internal face, with reference to the direction of
flow of the gases, with at least one auxiliary flap (8)

articulated to the inside of the door (2) and intended, in
the cruise position, to be moved away from the internal

wall (6) of the door (2) in order to align itself with the
external surface of the annular duct (C), while in the

door-deployed position, said auxiliary flap (8) is folded
back against the internal wall (6) of the door (2), the

displacement of the auxiliary flap (8) between these two
positions being achieved by a means for controlling the

flap (8) which is made up by a set of link rods comprising
a so-called "first link rod" which is articulated to the

upstream end of the flap, said control means (8)
interacting, at the moment of opening and closing the door

(2), with a stop piece system (23 ; 230) carried by the
stationary part (1a) of the fairing, said reverser being

characterized in that said first link rod (21 ; 210) is
attached by an articulation pin (18 ; 180) at the end of a

second link rod (19 ; 190) itself articulated at its other
end (20 ; 200) to the inside of the upstream end of the

door (2), a third link rod (17 ; 170) being articulated at
one of its ends to the articulation pin (18 ; 180) between

the first and second link rods, while its other end is
articulated at the end of an actuating link rod (12 ; 

130,142,140) which is articulated so that it can pivot
about a fixed pin (11 ; 110) of the door, this actuating

link rod (12 ; 130,142,140) providing the displacement of
the set of link rods by its interaction with the stop piece

system (23 ; 230) carried by the stationary part (1a) of
the fairing, said set of link rods providing an

immobilization of the flap (8) in each of the two positions
which it can assume, by extending, at the end of travel,

beyond a neutral point (29,34) between two of the
consecutive link rods (19,21 ; 12,17) of the set of link

rods.
The thrust reverser as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the amount by which each of the

neutral points (29,34) between the two consecutive link
rods (19,21 ; 12,17) of the set of link rods can be

exceeded is limited by the actuating link rod (12) bearing
against travel-limiting stops (3a,3b) integral with the

door (2).
The thrust reverser as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the auxiliary flap (8) is held

against the internal wall (5) of the door (2), when the
door is in the deployed position, by the exceeding of a

neutral point (34) between the actuating link rod (12) and
said third link rod (17) articulated to the end of said

actuating link rod.
The thrust reverser as claimed in any of claims 1
to 3, characterized in that the auxiliary flap (8) is held

in its position away from the internal wall (5) of the door
(2) when the latter is in the stowed position by the

exceeding of a neutral point (29) between said first and
second link rods (19,21) which are articulated, in the case

of one of them, to the upstream end of the door (2) and, in
the case of the other, to the auxiliary flap (8).
The thrust reverser as claimed in any of claims 1
to 4, characterized in that the actuating link rod (12 ;

130,142,140) comprises, on either side of the pin (11 ;

110) via which it is articulated to the door, a first arm
(12 ; 130) which is articulated to said third link rod 

(17 ; 170) of the set of link rods and a second arm (14 ;
140) which projects with respect to the upstream edge (9a)

of the door (2) and is intended to interact with said stop
piece system (23 ; 230).
The thrust reverser as claimed in any of claims
1 to 4, characterized in that the actuating link rod (130)

articulated to said stationary pin (110) of the door,
exhibits an arm (131) attached by a linkage (142) to a

moving finger (140) which is articulated to a stationary
pin (141) of the door and has one free end projecting with

respect to the upstream edge (9a) of the door (2) to
interact with said stop piece system (230), said linkage

(142) being, on the one hand, articulated so that it can
pivot on said arm (131) of the actuating link rod (130)

and, on the other hand, articulated so that it can pivot to
the moving finger (140) at a point situated between the

stationary pivot pin (141) of the finger (140) and the
projecting free end of the latter, said linkage (142)

transmitting the movement from the finger (140) to the
actuating link rod (130).
The thrust reverser as claimed in any of claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the stop piece system (23 ;

230) carried by the stationary part (1a) of the fairing and
with which the means for controlling the auxiliary flap

(8)interacts includes a bracket (24 ; 52 ; 72), part (25 ;
53 ; 73) of which extends in the direction of the door (2)

to act as an arrester stop piece for the part (50 ; 150) of
the means for controlling the flap which projects with

respect to the upstream edge (9a) of the door, said bracket
(24 ; 52 ; 72) exhibiting, above its part (25 ; 53 ; 73)

forming a stop piece, a projecting snout (26 ; 75 ; 520)
which, when the door is being opened, acts on the actuating

link rod (12 ; 130) of the flap (8) to force it to tilt.
The thrust reverser as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that the projecting snout (26 ; 520) is

stationary with respect to the bracket (24 ; 52).
The thrust reverser as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that the projecting snout is made up by a 

latch (75 ; 175) mounted so that it can tilt on a pin (74)
of the bracket (72) and urged by a spring (76) into the out

position above the part (73) of the bracket (72) forming a
stop piece.
The thrust reverser as claimed in claim 9,
characterized in that the free end of the latch (175) has a

concave shape (176) ending in a bearing finger (177), this
free end of the latch interacting and remaining in contact

with the end (150) of the projecting part of the means
(140) for controlling the flap during all of the manoeuvres

at the beginning of opening and end of closing the door
(2).
The thrust reverser as claimed in any of claims 7
to 10, characterized in that the bracket (52 ; 72) is

mounted on the stationary part (1a) of the fairing by means
of an elastic damper member (58 ; 83) allowing a slight

excursion of the bracket.
