<ABSTRACT>
In an instant bingo game card marking of numbers on a player 
card (18,20,22,24) portion is effected while the numbers are 

at all times visible, there being indicating means (26,28,30) 
adapted to function so as to provide a change from a darker to 

a lighter colour. In one embodiment the indicating means 
(26,28,30) is covered by a scratch-off layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of instant lottery tickets
and in particular to instant bingo game cards.The purpose of an instant bingo card or ticket is to simulate
the play of a conventional bingo game utilizing instant
lottery technology. An instant bingo card will normally
include a caller card portion which has a number of
combinations of letters and numbers covered by a latex or
scratch-off coating. The letter-number combinations on the
caller's card correspond to the letter-number combinations
found on the balls that are typically drawn in a conventional
bingo game. There are normally twenty five letter-number
combination printed under the scratch-off coating. Also
printed on an instant bingo card is a group of usually four to
six player cards which are similar in format to bingo cards
used by players in conventional bingo games. To play the
game, a player will scratch off the coating over the letter-number
combinations on the caller's card and mark on each of
the player cards any numbers that may correspond to letter-number
combinations on the caller's card. Usually printed on
the instant bingo card adjacent to the player cards is an
indication of the combinations that will result in the
awarding of a prize. After marking the player cards, the
player is able to determine if one or more of the player cards
represent a winning combination and if a winning combination
is present, the player can then present the card to a lottery
agent to redeem the indicated prize(s). One of the challenges of producing a commercially satisfactory
instant lottery card is to provide a method for marking the
player cards which is convenient to use yet economical to
manufacture. In one approach the numbers on the player cards
are covered by a scratch-off coating and numbers corresponding
directly to the numbers printed on the player card are
printed, utilizing for example a technique disclosed in U.S.
Patent 5,074,566, on the scratch-off coating. The player is
then able to mark his cards by scratching off the numbers on
his player card corresponding to the letter-number
combinations on the caller card portion of the instant bingo
card. This approach has two disadvantages in that it requires
a second scratch-off area and more importantly requires two
separate printings of the numbers on the player cards. These
factors substantially increase the manufacturing cost of the
card. The second scratch-off area also results in a great
deal more scratch-off debris following the play of the game.A second technique, as
