<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for preparing recyclable reinforced composite structures having enhanced surface appearance by heating a self-supporting porous batt comprised of an intimate homogenous blend of high modulus reinforcing fibers and thermoplastic resin fibers to a temperature sufficient to melt the resin component and convert the batt into moldable form, placing the moldable batt into a heated mold to flow, solidify and substantially crystallize the resin component, introducing a thermosetting resin-containing coating material into the mold adjacent at least one surface of the crystallized structure to provide a coating on the one surface and dwelling the coated structure in the mold for a time sufficient to set the coating material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to providing recyclable high modulus fiber 
reinforced composite structures having an enhanced surface appearance. The use of plastic components in combination with metal parts is common in 
the production of automobiles. Mixtures of resins and reinforcing materials are used 
as sheet molding compounds, SMCs, which are molded to form various shaped 
articles. Generally in applications requiring high quality painted surfaces, highly filled 
thermosetting SMCs have been used. A long standing problem in providing reinforced composite structures resides 
in manufacturing structures which when painted provide a Class A finish. These 
structures such as automotive body panels must be capable of being processed in 
assembly plants with steel panels. They must be able to survive assembly plant 
conditions, painting and baking, where maximum metal temperatures can reach 200Â°C 
for as long as 30 minutes with surface coatings remaining firmly adhered to the 
substrate and retaining their Class A appearance. The body panels must have, after 
processing, an appearance that is comparable to the appearance of an adjoining part 
made of steel. They must also have acceptable dimensional stability in order to 
maintain the highest quality fit and finish over wide temperature extremes found in 
various geographical market segments. When using SMCs, surface appearance 
problems such as "paint pops" occur due to emission of low molecular weight 
monomers in the thermosetting substrate. in addition, an ever increasing concern is 
whether the material is readily recyclable during manufacture and in post manufacture 
use. For example, can the resin component be remelted or depolymerized. The 
thermosetting SMCs are not recyclable in the sense that they cannot be remelted or 
depolymerized. EP-A-0372740 discloses a composite structure comprising high modulus 
reinforcing fibers randomly dispersed in a polyester resin. In this document, a powder 
coating is applied to a glass-fiber reinforced polyester panel. In contrast, in the 
present invention, a liquid thermosetting coating is applied to a reinforced 
thermoplastic substrate as an integral part of a single-cycle molding process.  
 The products of this invention which solve the problems noted 
above are made by preparing composite structures comprised of a substrate 
prepared from a plurality of layers of a self-supporting porous web comprised 
of randomly dispersed high modulus reinforcing fibers held together by 
solidified thermoplastic

A process for preparing a recyclable reinforced composite structure 
having enhanced surface appearance comprising: 


a) heating a batt comprised of a plurality of layers of a self-supporting 
porous web comprised of randomly dispersed high modulus reinforcing fiber held 

together by solidified thermoplastic resin to convert the batt into moldable form, 
b) placing the moldable form into a heated mold and flowing said 
moldable form under pressure to substantially crystallize the thermoplastic resin 

component, 
c) introducing a liquid thermosetting resin-containing coating material into 
the mold adjacent at least one surface of the crystallized structure by separating the 

sections of said mold and/or releasing the pressure and closing said heated mold under 
pressure to provide a substantially uniform coating oil said one surface, 
d) dwelling the coated structure in the mold for a time sufficient to set 
said coating material, and 
e) recovering a molded part having an enhanced surface appearance. 
The process of claim 1 wherein said thermoplastic resin is a polyester. 
The process of claim 1 or 2 wherein said high modulus reinforcing fiber 
is glass fiber comprising from 5 to 50 percent by weight of said moldable form 
The process of any one of the preceding claims wherein said glass fiber 
has a length from 1 to 10 cm and a diameter from 5 to 50 microns and said 

thermoplastic resin is polyethylene terephthalate. 
A composite structure having a substrate comprised of high modulus 
reinforcing fibers randomly dispersed in a thermoplastic resin and a thin thermosetting 

resin-containing coating adhered to a surface of said substrate, said thermosetting resin 
being in a substantially crystallized state, said coating having a maximum surface 

roughness deviation of less than 50 micro-inches (0.00127 mm) over a 0.25 inch (6.35 
mm) span for the coated surface and a coating to substrate adhesion value greater than 

1000 psi (6.9 M pascals).  
 
The structure of claim 5 wherein said coating has a thickness of from 
about 0.076 to 0.26 mm. 
The structure of claim 5 or 6 wherein said reinforcing fiber is glass fiber 
and said thermoplastic resin is a polyester resin. 
The structure of any one of claims 5 to 7 wherein said thermosetting 
resin is an acrylic based vinyl polymer composition. 
The structure of any one of claims 5 to 8 having multiple layers of paint 
on the surface of said thin thermosetting resin-containing coating
