<ABSTRACT>
A rescue ramp (10) for use by a watercraft (11) 
includes a laterally extending first inflatable tube member 

(14) attachable to the watercraft (11). Second spaced 
inflatable tube members (15) are connected at one end to 

and extend longitudinally from the ends of the first tube 
member (14). A third inflatable tube member (16) is 

connected between the second tube members (15) near the 
other end thereof and is adapted to be positioned in the 

water. A ramp (17) is connected to the first and second 
tube members (14, 15) so that when the rescue ramp (10) is 

inflated and attached to the watercraft (11), a person may 
traverse from the water to the watercraft (11) or from the 

watercraft (11) to the water. The first tube member (14) 
is attached to the watercraft (11) by means of a girt bar 

(23) releasably mounted on the watercraft (11). The girt 
bar (23) is connected to a first flap (26) which is 

detachably connected to a second flap (20) attached to the 
first tube member (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inflatable rescue 
ramp which may be carried in an uninflated, stowed 
condition by a rescue craft or other watercraft. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a rescue ramp 
which, after being attached to the watercraft and inflated, 
extends into the water so that a person stranded in the 
water can move up the ramp and into the watercraft or a 
person from the watercraft can move down the ramp to assist 
a person in the water, as necessary. The rescuing of people stranded in a body of 
water, particularly turbulent waters encountered in the 
oceans of the world, is not a simple task. In many 
environments, such as at off-shore drilling rigs, motorized 
boats are held by davits to be deployed in the event of an 
emergency, such as an explosion at the site, which might 
cause many people to be stranded in the water. Upon such a 
disaster, it is usually not difficult for the rescue craft 
to arrive at the location of the stranded person or 
persons, but rather the problem is boarding the person into 
the craft. Such a procedure is compounded not only if the 
person is unconscious or injured, but also if turbulent 
water is prevalent. Present known devices of rescuing a person from 
the sea are not satisfactory for all encountered 
circumstances. One of the simplest known devices is a 
rope-like ladder which is attached to the boat at its hatch 
or portal and merely thrown in the water so that the person 
to be rescued might climb into the boat. While such may be 
satisfactory in calm seas, in turbulent situations it is 
not only difficult to climb the undulating ladder, but also 
it is highly likely that the person could be injured, as by 
striking his head on the gunnel or ledge below the hatch.  
 
Moreover, the ladder is totally useless if the person to be 
rescued is injured or unconscious. In such situations, the 
rescue boat must be manned with several people, some of 
whom must traverse down the ladder to assist the person to 
and up the ladder, while others in the craft assist to pull 
the person on board, while all the time trying to avoid 
contact with the undulating gunnel. Another prior art device which has been utilized 
is a net-like structure which is thrown toward the person 
to be rescued. If conscious, he may then either hold onto 
or lay on the net while being pulled into the craft. Such 
a device suffers from the same problems as does the 
aforementioned ladder and is simply not a convenient and 
safe manner in which to rescue the panicked person. A

<CLAIMS>
A rescue ramp for a watercraft comprising a 
laterally extending first inflatable tube member, means 

to at least temporarily connect said first tube member 
to the watercraft, second spaced inflatable tube members 

having one end connected to said first tube member and 
extending generally longitudinally away from said first 

tube member, a third tube member connected between said 
second tube members near the other end thereof and 

adapted to be positioned in the water when said first 
tube member is connected to the watercraft, and ramp 

means connected to said first and second tube members so 
that a person may traverse said ramp means from the 

water to the watercraft or from the watercraft to the 
water. 
A rescue ramp according to claim 1, further 
comprising means to inflate said tube members, said 

means to inflate including a pressurized canister 
carried by said first tube member, a valve positioned in 

at least one of said second tube members, and an 
additional valve positioned in said first tube member to 

pressurize said tube members, as necessary. 
A rescue ramp according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
further comprising first attachment means positioned at 

said other end of said second tube members and second 
attachment means positioned on said first tube member, 

said second tube members being adapted to be folded 
generally longitudinally in half so that said first 

attachment means can engage said second attachment 
means. 
A rescue ramp according to any of claims 1 to 
3, wherein said means to connect includes a bar member 

attachable to the watercraft, a first flap member 
carrying said bar member, and a second flap member 

attached to said first tube member, said first and 

second flap members being detachably connectable to each 
other. 
A rescue ramp according to any of claims 1 to 
3, wherein said means to connect includes a flap member 

generally centrally positioned along said first tube 
member, said first tube member being adapted to be 

folded such that it is of a lateral extent approximating 
the length of said flap member while at the same time 

positioning said second tube members adjacent to each 
other. 
A rescue ramp according to any of claims 1 to 
5, further comprising a plurality of hand/foot holds 

positioned on said ramp means to assist the person 
traversing said ramp means. 
A rescue ramp according to any of claims 1 to 
6, further comprising a hand-hold mounted on each said 

second tube member near said other end thereof and above 
said ramp means to assist the person to get on said ramp 

means. 
A rescue ramp according to any of claims 1 to 
7, further comprising life lines mounted on said second 

tube members on the sides thereof opposite said ramp 
means. 
A rescue ramp according to any of claims 1 to 
 

8, further comprising at least one light positioned on 
each said second tube member to illuminate said ramp 

means, and a battery connected to each said light and 
positioned on said third tube member so as to be in 

contact with the water. 
A rescue ramp according to any of claims 1 to 
9, further comprising means on said second tube members 

to attach the rescue ramp to a second watercraft.
