<ABSTRACT>
An estimating circuit for application in estimating or deriving the value 
V 2   / rms or V 2    / peak, of a line voltage V
AC
 provides fast response time and a substantially 
ripple free value for these signals by the utilization of a controlled harmonic 

oscillator whose output precisely tracks the input voltage waveform. Two out of 
phase (by π/2) sine wave signals are derived (by 101,102) from the input sine wave 

(on 105), and these two out of phase signals are squared (in 115,117) and summed 
(in 119) to derive or estimate the desired square of the sine waveform signal at a fast 

response time while substantially excluding ripple of the estimated out of phase sine 
waves. An estimating circuit, described herein, comprises two integrator circuits 

(101,102) series connected into a substantially closed loop. The output of the second 
integrator (102) circuit is fed back to the input of the first integrator circuit (101). 

The output of each individual integrator circuit is a voltage sine wave separated in 
phase from the output of the other integrator by π/2 and in synchronism with the 

input substantially sine wave voltage V
AC
. The output of each of the integrator 
circuits is squared in an associated squaring circuit (115,117). Each output of one of 

the two squaring circuits is summed (in 119) with the output of the other squaring 
circuit to produce the desired value of V 2    / peak or V 2   / rms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to signal estimation circuits and in particular to a 
signal sensing and estimation circuit for application to a power factor enhancement 
circuit included in a power supply circuit operating from an AC line supplying 
a sinusoidal or nearly sinusoidal voltage waveform. Power supplies operating directly off of an AC line typically comprise 
an input rectifier to convert the input AC line voltage to a DC voltage. This DC 
voltage is typically applied to a charge storage capacitor which is connected to the 
input of a DC/DC converter, which converts this DC voltage to a DC voltage of 
another level at its output. The operating characteristics of the rectifier and storage 
capacitor inherently distort the input current waveform at the input to the rectifier. 
This waveform distortion causes harmonics to be fed back onto the AC line and 
further leads to significant EMI emissions and to unnecessary power losses in the AC 
distribution circuitry. In other applications power supplies may operate directly off of an AC 
line to drive a frequency changer to provide a signal at a different frequency from 
that on the AC line. The input waveform may be distorted leading to the difficulties 
described above. The distortion of the input current waveform may be controlled by using 
an active power factor controller and a converter, such as a boost converter, inserted 
between the rectifier and the storage capacitor to actively control the input current 
waveform. The active switching device is controlled in response to a control circuit 
that monitors the input voltage waveform. The control modulates the conduction 
intervals at a high frequency compared with the AC line frequency, so that the wave 
form of the input current is constrained to conform to that of the input voltage 
waveform or to the fundamental sinusoidal waveform of that input voltage 
waveform. Active power factor control networks typically sense input and output 
signal parameters of the power circuit and utilize a power switch selectively 
switched or pulse width modulated in response to these signal parameters to force 
the input current to conform to a desired current waveform. In a particular 
illustrative arrangement disclosed in U. S. patent 4,412,277 a rectified input voltage 
waveform is multiplied with an error voltage representing the deviation of the output  
 
voltage from a regulated value. The resulting control signal is properly scaled and 
used to control the modulating pulse driving the power switch to
