<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing silicon carbide

organosilicon high-molecular compound to obtain 
precursory fibers, rendering infusible the precursory 

fibers to obtain infusible fibers, and baking the 
infusible fibers thereby to obtain silicon carbide 

fibers, characterized in that the baking is performed 
in an atmosphere selected from the group consisting of 

a hydrogen gas atmosphere, a dilute hydrogen gas 
atmosphere and an inert gas atmosphere, with the 

proviso that the baking at any temperature in at least 
a part of a temperature range from 500 to 950 °C is 

carried out in a hydrogen gas or dilute hydrogen gas 
atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
for producing silicon carbide fibers and more
particularly to a process for producing silicon
carbide fibers having excellent resistance to
oxidation, high strength and high elastic modulus as
well as desirable wettability with various metallic
base materials, in which a hydrogen gas or dilute
hydrogen gas atmosphere is employed as the baking
atmosphere within at least a part of the temperature
range in the baking step.Silicon carbide fibers have conventionally
been produced by spinning polycarbosilane or the like
to obtain precursory fibers, rendering infusible the
precursory fibers under given conditions, and then
baking the infusible precursory fibers in the
atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen gas by
raising the temperature of the atmosphere.Although the silicon carbide fibers produced
by the above conventional process have a certain
measure of high strength and elastic modulus, they are
low particularly in modulus as compared with a silicon 
carbide having a stoichiometric composition. Further,
they are unsatisfactory in resistance to oxidation
because of their relatively high content of free
carbon besides silicon carbide. Thus, the above
conventional silicon carbide fibers have a drawback
that their uses at high temperatures are restricted.
Further, they have another drawback that their
wettability with various metallic base materials are
poor because of their relatively high content of free
carbon, thereby to raise a problem that a composite
material made of said fibers and metallic materials
will be poor in adhesion therebetween.From DE-A-3809614 a process for producing ceramics material
based on silicon carbide and/or silicon nitride is disclosed.
The process is carried out in a pure hydrogen atmosphere. If
H2 gas is employed at temperatures exceeding 950°C the amount
of silicon in the fibres becomes contrarily more than that of
carbon. This results in the deterioration in oxidation
resistance at high temperatures of the SiC fibers, lowered
strength and elastic modulus. JP-A-53103025 discloses a method for producing silicon carbide
fibres by spinning an organic silicon polymer solution into
fibres, then making infusible, preheating and burning the
fibres. There is no H2 gas used in the baking step and no
switching from H2 gas to an inert gas at about 950°C is
suggested. A baking performed in a inert gas results in SiC-fibers
which contain free carbon and have a higher C/Si ratio.
Those fibres are lower in strength and elastic modulus.From
