<ABSTRACT>
A holder (10) for jigsaws has a support member (11) with a nonslip playing surface (12) and covers (15) hinged at either side of the support member (11). The jigsaw (19) is assembled on the playing surface (12). The hinges (20) are formed by a heat seal weld between the non-slip surface (13) on one side of the holder (10) and a protective material (17) on the other side of the holder. Air passages (21) are defined between the end of each hinge seal (20) and an edge seal (18) of the holder. Air can be expelled from under the playing surface (12) into the cover members (15) where it is absorbed by a compressible foam like material (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a holder on which jigsaw puzzles (hereinafter and in the 
claims referred to simply as "Jigsaws") can be assembled and which permits incomplete 
jigsaws to be "frozen" in the incomplete or unfinished state and stored away for future 
use and completion. The applicant's co - pending European Patent application EP-A-0401290 
describes a holder for a jigsaw in which there is a friction lined playing surface and a 
cover or covers hinged to the playing surface. The cover(s) has (have) a compressible 
blanket or pad adapted to engage the assembled or partly assembled jigsaw when the 
cover overlies the playing surface. One of the problems with such holders is that air can get trapped behind the 
lining of the playing surface resulting in an uneven playing surface. Furthermore, once 
the jigsaw is assembled it cannot be removed without dismantling it. It is an object of the present invention to provide a jigsaw puzzle holder which 
obviates or mitigates the above drawbacks. According to the present invention there is provided a holder for a jigsaw 
comprising a support member having a non-slip playing surface on which a jigsaw can 
be assembled, a cover member pivoted or hinged to the support member so as to be 
moveable between an open position in which said playing surface is exposed and a 
closed position in which the cover member overlies the support member and playing 
surface the surface of the cover member adapted to lie adjacent the support member 
being of a compressible non-slip nature to lock assembled and/or unassembled jigsaw 
pieces in position and means for releasably securing the cover member to the support 
member in overlying relationship to the support member, wherein each of said members 
is formed of at least a protective layer and a non-slip layer whereby said layers are 
sealed around their outer peripheral edges, the holder being characterised in that there is 
provided a passage extending between the support member and the cover member so 
that in said open position air from under the non-slip surface of the support member can 
be expelled to under the non-slip surface of said cover member via said passage. The passage should preferably extend to the cover member such that air can be 
expelled from the support member to the cover member.  
 Preferably, the cover member adapted to lie adjacent the support 
member is covered with non-slip plastics foam material, or flock 
material and has a layer of compressible material. The air expelled 
from the support

<CLAIMS>
A holder for a jigsaw comprising a support member (11) having a non-slip 
playing surface (12) on which a jigsaw (19) can be assembled, a cover member 

(15) pivoted or hinged to the support member (11) so as to be moveable between 
an open position in which said playing surface (12) is exposed and a closed 

position in which the cover member (15) overlies the support member (11) and 
playing surface (12) the surface (13) of the cover member (15) adapted to lie 

adjacent the support member (11) being of a compressible non-slip nature to 
lock assembled and/or unassembled jigsaw pieces (19, 27) in position and means 

(23, 24) for releasably securing the cover member (15) to the support member 
(11) in overlying relationship to the support member (11), wherein each of said 

members (11, 15) is formed of at least a protective layer (17) and a non-slip 
layer (13) whereby said layers are sealed around their outer peripheral edges 

(18), the holder being characterised in that there is provided a passage (21) 
extending between the support member (11) and the cover member (15) so that 

in said open position air from under the non-slip surface (13) of the support 
member (11) can be expelled to under the non-slip surface (13) of said cover 

member (15) via said passage (21). 
A holder according to claim 1, wherein the cover member (15) is covered with a 
non-slip plastics foam material, or flock material. 
A holder according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the cover member (15) has a layer 
of compressible foam like material (16). 
A holder according to any preceding claim wherein the surface of the cover 
member (15) and the playing surface (12) on one side of the holder are heat-welded 

to a protective material (17) on the other side of the holder. 
A holder according to claim 3 or 4 wherein air can be expelled from under the 
playing surface (12) to the compressible material (16) under the surface of cover 

member (15) via said passage (21).  
 
A holder according to any preceding claim wherein, the cover member (15) is 
separated from the support member (11) by means of a hinge (20). 
A holder according to claim 6 when dependent on claim 4 or 5, wherein the 
hinge (20) comprises the protective material (17) and non-slip surface (13) being 

sealed together. 
A holder according to claim 6 or 7, wherein the passage (21) comprises a 
channel (21) through the sealed hinge (20). 
A holder according to claim 8, wherein there are a plurality of passages (21) in 
each hinge (20). 
A holder according to any one of claims 7 to 9, wherein the passage (21) is 
defined by a gap between the hinge seal (20) and an edge seal (18) at the holder. 
A holder according to any preceding claim, wherein there is provided a backing 
sheet (25) removably locatable in said playing surface (12) and in which a 

jigsaw (19) may be assembled. 
A holder according to claim 11, wherein the backing sheet (25) has a non-slip 
surface.
