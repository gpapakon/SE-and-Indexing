<ABSTRACT>
An endless timber pole (1), composed of individual bars (2, 3, 4, 5) of relatively short lengths (l1, l2, l3, l4) and in each case the same cross-section, is characterized in that adjacent individual bars (2, 3; 3, 4; 4, 5) are joined together by finger jointing (K), preferably by means of a one-component polyurethane adhesive. Such an endless timber pole (1) is hardly any different in its properties from a timber pole produced from a single tree trunk, and the waste produced during its manufacture is reduced to a minimum.
