<ABSTRACT>
Method of erecting walls, in particular outer walls, of a building by means of form elements (1) which are designed with insulating inserts (3). In this arrangement, the interior of the form elements (1) are subdivided in the longitudinal direction of the walls, into two regions by means of a layer (3) consisting of a heat-insulating material, a layer (4) consisting of a material which is a good heat conductor being introduced into the region located on the outer side of the wall, and a layer (5) consisting of a heat-storing material being introduced into the region located on the inner side of the wall, and a pipe (7) for channelling a transfer medium for heat or cold is introduced at least into the layer (5) consisting of a heat-storing material.

A method for the erection of walls, especially external
walls, of a building, by means of formwork elements (1) which

are constructed with insulating inserts, the inner space in
the formwork elements (1) being subdivided into two areas in

the longitudinal direction of the walls by means of a layer
(3) of a heat-insulating material, characterised in that a

layer (5) of a heat-accumulating material is inserted into
the area lying on the inside of the walls, in that a layer

(4) of a material exhibiting good heat conductivity is
inserted into the area lying on the outside of the walls and

in that a pipe (7) for conveying a medium acting as a heat
transfer medium or coolant is inserted in a manner known per

se at least into the layer (5) of heat-accumulating material.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that a
pipe (6) for conveying a medium acting as a heat transfer

medium or coolant is also inserted into the layer (4) of
material exhibiting good heat conductivity.
A method according to either one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the layer (4) of material exhibiting

good heat conductivity is constructed as a statically load-bearing
layer.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the layer (4) of material exhibiting

good heat conductivity is made of concrete with the addition
of a heat-conducting material, such as a metal powder.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the layer (5) of heat-accumulating 

material is formed of clay, loam, lightweight concrete or the
like.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the layer (3) of heat-insulating

material is formed of rock wool, glass wool, mineral wool,
cork or the like.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the layer (5) of heat-accumulating

material is approximately twice as thick as the layers (4, 3)
of material exhibiting good heat conductivity and insulating

material.
A formwork element for carrying out the method according
to any one of claims 1 to 7, consisting of two plates (21)

which are connected by means of transverse webs (22) coupled
hingedly thereto, characterised in that the transverse webs

(22) are constructed with strips (24) for attaching inserts
(23) of an insulating material oriented in the longitudinal

direction of the plates (21).
