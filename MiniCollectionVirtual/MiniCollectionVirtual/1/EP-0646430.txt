<ABSTRACT>
A refractory block which has a construction wherein the outer peripheral surface of a unitary assembly of plate bricks and 
an immersion nozzle is directly encompassed by a unitary metal case. It is also possible to employ a construction wherein plate 

bricks stored in a metal case are bonded to the dowel portions of the immersion nozzle stored in a separate cylindrical metal case 
through mortar and the metal cases are welded integrally to each other, a construction wherein a unitary refractory block of the 

plate bricks and the immersion nozzle is encompassed by a unitary metal case, or a construction wherein the unitary refractory 
block is fitted to a unitary metal case through an amorphous refractory. The unitary refractory block may be a combination of different 

kinds of refractories, and it is further possible to employ a construction wherein the plate bricks and the immersion nozzle 
are fitted into a unitary metal case with porous bricks sandwiched between the plate bricks and the immersion nozzle, and 

feed/discharge pipes are so disposed in the porous bricks as to penetrate through the metal case.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to refractory blocks for
slide gate valve which is used for controlling the flow of
a molten steel in continuous casting equipment of the
molten steel.From the recent viewpoint of laborsaving it is
required to simplify and accelerate the working of incorporating
a brick into a slide gate valve, and therefore
it is adopted to integrally set a slide plate and a chute
nozzle. Conventionally, in such an integrating method
it has been general to set the slide plate and the chute
nozzle by using a filler such as mortar or castable in a
one-body metal casing which is formed to envelop the side
surface and bottom surface of said slide plate and the
side surface of said chute nozzle.However, such a system has demerits in that parallelism
can hardly be retained between the sliding surface
and the bottom surface of the metal casing because of the
fluidity of the filler, and a long period of time is
required for the complete hardening of the filler. To remove such demerits the applicant of the
present application previously proposed to employ "an
Accommodation Structure of Refractory for Slide Valve"
(Utility Model Publication No. 2-35405).By adopting such an accommodation structure it has
become to easily take a parallelism of the slide plate,
to accelerate adhesion, and to easily manufacture the
refractory block for slide gate valve by ordinary cutting,
welding or the like of the steel material. However, with
such an accommodation structure the steel plate fixed to
the bottom surface of the slide gate valve has no sufficient
strength, and it is known that because of thermal expansion
of the metal casing a clearance is likely to occur
between the slide plate or seal plate and the mortar-bonded
seal nozzle or the submerged nozzle, troubles
occasionally occur due to metal insertion or the like, and
a complete integration is impossible. Conventionally, a plate brick and a submerge nozzle are of split type. US 4,541,553 discloses
an interlocking collector nozzle assembly for pouring molten metal comprising an upper
nozzle portion, a lower nozzle portion, a slidable surface plate and metal housings covering
the above mentioned elements. The upper and the lower nozzle part are secured together by
an interlocking joint and cemented. Neither is the nozzle assembly secured to the slidable
surface plate, nor are the metal housings connected or secured together.The document US 3,877,675 discloses a nozzle block or a slidable gate for bottom pouring
vessels. As the attachment, a special seal comprising
