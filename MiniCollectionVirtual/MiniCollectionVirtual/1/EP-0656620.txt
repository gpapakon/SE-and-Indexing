<ABSTRACT>
A head 
(DMR) having a narrow track width (Wr), defined as equal to or 

less than 10 times the height (L) of its MR elements, for use 
in reproducing signals having short wavelengths greater 

than 100 kiloflux changes per inch. The track width 
reduction to less than 10 times the MR element height 

introduces new parameters into the determination of the 
DMR signal response. In particular, the directional sense 

of the magnetization vectors along the longitudinal axes 
of the two MR elements join with the transverse bias field 

direction and the signal field direction in determining 
the head response; that is, the head's performance is now 

determined by its "three dimensional" characteristics, 
rather than the "two dimensional" characteristics as in 

the prior art. In the "symmetric" DMR, the longitudinal 
bias component (48,50,52,54) in each of the DMR's magnetoresistive 

elements (36,38) are parallel and oriented in the same direction, 
while i
n the "anti-symmetric" DMR the longitudinal bias 
components (84,86,88,90) are parallel but are oriented in opposite 

directions. The symmetric DMR has an off- track response (100,102) 
which allows it to possibly serve simultaneously as a 

tracking head as well as a data reproduce head, while the 
anti- symmetric DMR has a data signal output (98) that can be 

more than twice that of the symmetric DMR.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic recording, and in 
particular to a dual magnetoresistive head (DMR) for 
reproducing short wavelength, very narrow trackwidth 
digital data. The trend in digital disk recording systems continues 
in the direction of higher areal recording densities. This 
trend provides increased efficiency in the use of the 
recording medium, and contributes to the overall 
compactness and reduction in size of current computers. 
At the present time, linear recording densities of 50 kilo 
flux changes per inch and track densities of 2500 tracks 
per inch result in readily available areal densities of 
125 megabits per square inch. An important component in attaining higher areal 
densities has been the MR reproduce head utilized in 
conjunction with a inductive record head. Both shielded 
and unshielded single element MR heads are known in the 
art, and each configuration has its advantages and its 
limitations. However, both configurations provide 
advantages which include independence of output level on 
head/media velocity and optimization of the write and read 
functions of the combined inductive write/ MR read 
transducer. The dual MR head (DMR) having a pair of unshielded MR 
elements as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,084,794 provides 
the additional advantages of ease of head fabrication, 
excellent short wavelength response, a self biasing 
characteristic, and freedom from MR element shorting  
 
problems present in other biased MR head configurations. 
U.S. Patent 5,084,794 is hereby incorporated by reference. Referring to Fig. 1, a typical DMR 10 known in the 
prior art consists of two magnetically, electrically and 
geometrically matched MR elements 12,14. In this DMR 
embodiment, the MR elements 12,14 are separated over 
substantially their entire lengths by an electrically 
conductive spacer 16. A sense and biasing current 22 
flowing to the head 10 via leads 24,26 divides between the 
two MR elements 12,14 into two equal currents 28,30 
because the MR elements 12,14 are identical; a small 
portion of the current 22 flows in the spacer 16. The DMR 
10 is shown in contact with a magnetic medium 11. The thin film MR elements 12,14 are rectangular in 
shape. This configuration results in the shape anisotropy 
of the MR film being directed along the longitudinal axis 
of the film, which is also the direction of its unbiased 
magnetization. Static bias fields generated by the flow of 
sense current rotate the magnetization from this axial 
direction, and the signals from the
