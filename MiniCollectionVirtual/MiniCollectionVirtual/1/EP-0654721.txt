<ABSTRACT>
The automatic manufacturing system is equipped with a plurality of manufacturing stations (4), a material flow system which comprises a storage device (3), a transport device (5, 13, 14, 15) and handling devices (12), and an information flow system for controlling the manufacturing system. The information flow system has two separate data networks (19, 20). A first, external data network (19) is provided for the exchange of process control data between a central computer (21) and the manufacturing stations (4) and for the exchange of transport control data between the central computer (21) and a transport control station (13). A second, internal data network (20) connects the storage device (3), the transport device (5, 13, 14, 15) and the handling devices (12) to one another. The material to be converted, that is to say the workpieces and tools, has assigned to it in a fixed manner data for identification of the material, destination data for the transport of the material, and data for calling up programs for the processing of the material, the internal data network (20) being intended for the exchange of these data. This manufacturing system is suitable for fully automatic flexible manufacture, thanks to its improved information system.
