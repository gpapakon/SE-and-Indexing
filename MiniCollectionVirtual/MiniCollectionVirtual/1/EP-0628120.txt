<ABSTRACT>
A device is provided which allows wall coverings to be hung without the need for specific equipment even in the narrowest portions of the panels to be covered. Said device consists of a thin PVC section including a flexible fabric-gripping device (5) comprising two spaced lips (5a, 5b) lying in a single plane parallel to the bearing surface of the section (1). A tapered edge (3) forms a space to receive the edge of the fabric and a double-sided adhesive tape (13) allows the fabric to be adjusted then helps to hold it in place. Said device is particularly designed for wall hangings or the like with invisible finishing to be hung in the narrow portions of panels.

System for fixing wall hangings comprising a section presenting a first face for 
application against the backing and a second face opposite this first face characterized in 

that
 
the first face is extended by an edge on which is fixed, set back from the first face, a 

flexible flap (5) with two lips (5a, 5b) arranged in the form of a V which are flush in a same 
perpendicular plane with the first and second faces, the two lips securing the hanging 

against the adjacent surface perpendicular to the backing surface. 
Device according to claim 1, wherein
 
the two lips (5a and 5b) of the flexible flap are arranged in fan form with a first lip 

(5a), rounded, situated on the opposite side to the face opposite the backing surface of the 
section and a second lip (5b) situated on the side of the backing surface. 
Device according to any one of claims 1 or 2, wherein
 
it represents a flat upper face (8) and only has a slight width to enable laying of wall 

hangings on straight surfaces, a double-sided adhesive tape (13) being stuck on this face 
(8). 
Device as per any one of claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein
 
it includes a pinching system which opens at the level of the upper face of the 

section and is designed to hold cotton wadding or woven fabric backing. 
Device according to claim 4, wherein
 
the pinching system (12) is fitted at the end towards the bottom with a notched lip (7) 

or tongue to hold the material in the said pinching device (12). 
Device according to any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein
 
it comprises a reservation bounded by the section, the flap (5), the bearing surface 

and the adjoining surface. 
Device according to claim 6, wherein
 
the reservation consists of a feathered edge (3) at the section level.
