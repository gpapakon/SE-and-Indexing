<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for making fine paper that is 
sized under alkaline conditions with a 2-oxetanone sizing 

agent. The sizing agent is a mixture of alkyl ketene dimer 
and 2-oxetanone multimers of various molecular weights, at 

least 50% by weight of the 2-oxetanone compounds having at 
least two 2-oxetanone rings. The paper can be in the form of 

continuous forms bond paper, adding machine paper, and 
reprographic paper and can also be converted into envelopes. 

The paper exhibits levels of sizing comparable to those 
obtained with current alkyl ketene dimer and alkenyl succinic 

anhydride sizes, and gives improved performance in high speed 
converting and reprographic machines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of fine paper sized with a sizing agent comprising a mixture of 2-oxetanone compounds in high speed precision converting on reprographic operations.The amount of fine paper produced under alkaline
conditions has been increasing rapidly, encouraged by cost
savings, the ability to use precipitated calcium carbonate,
an increased demand for improved paper permanence and
brightness, and an increased tendency to close the wet end of
the paper machine.Current applications for fine paper require particular
attention to sizing before conversion or end-use, such as
high-speed photocopies, envelopes, forms bond including
computer printer paper, and adding machine paper. The most
common sizing agents for fine paper made under alkaline
conditions are alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA) and alkyl
ketene dimer (AKD). Both types of sizing agents have a
reactive functional group that covalently bonds to cellulose
fiber and hydrophobic tails that are oriented away from the 
fiber. The nature and orientation of these hydrophobic tails
cause the fiber to repel water.Commercial AKD's, containing one β-lactone ring, are
prepared by the dimerization of the alkyl ketenes made from
two saturated, straight-chain fatty acid chlorides; the most
widely used being prepared from palmitic and/or stearic acid.
Other ketene dimers, such as the alkenyl-based ketene dimer
(Aquapel® 421, available from Hercules Incorporated,
Wilmington, DE, U.S.A.), have also been used commercially.
ASA-based sizing agents can be prepared by the reaction of
maleic anhydride with a 14 to 18 carbon olefin.Although ASA and AKD sizing agents are commercially
successful, they have disadvantages. Both types of sizing
agents, particularly the AKD type, have been associated with
handling problems in the typical high-speed conversion
operations required for the current uses of fine paper made
under alkaline conditions (referred to as alkaline fine
paper). The problems include reduced operating speed in
forms presses and other converting machines, double feeds or
jams in high-speed copiers, and registration errors on
printing and envelope-folding equipment that operate at high
speeds. These problems are not normally associated with fine
paper produced under acid conditions (acid fine paper). The
types of filler and filler addition levels used to make
alkaline fine paper differ significantly from those used to
make acid fine paper, and can cause differences in paper
properties such as stiffness and coefficient of friction,
which affect
