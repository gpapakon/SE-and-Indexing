<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of processing recycled paper which contains so much wax, hot melts or stickies that they would be expected to cause a stoppage of the paper-manufacturing machine, the paper to be recycled being pulped in a pulper and passed on to a subsequent stage which includes despeckers, graders and cleaners hydrocyclones. The invention is characterized in that pulping takes place at a temperature of at least 60  DEG C, at the same time subjecting the paper to a high shear action, and that the processing line includes a pulp-thickening stage, preferably after the processing stages mentioned, in order to separate off most or a very high proportion of the wax, hot melts and stickies finely dispersed in the pulper.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparation of waste paper contaminated with 
wax, hot melts or other adhesives (stickies) so severely 

that faults on the paper machine are to be expected, by 
dissolution in a pulper (1) and further preparation stages 

which may include deflakers (2), separators (4) and 
hydrocyclones (cleaners) (5), characterised in that the 

dissolution takes place at a temperature of at least 60Â°C 
under the effect of high shear forces on the waste paper, 

and that in the preparation line, preferably after the said 
preparation stages, decking takes place in order to 

precipitate with the decking water the greatest or a very 
great part of the wax, hot melts and stickies finely 

dispersed in the pulper. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
decker water (filtrate from decking stage) (6) is cleaned 

of contaminants in a microflotation stage, filtration stage 
or normal flotation stage (selective flotation). 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the preparation consistency in the pulper (1) is at least 

8 %.
