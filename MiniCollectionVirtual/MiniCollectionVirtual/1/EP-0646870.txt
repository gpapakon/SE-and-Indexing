<ABSTRACT>
An information processing system 10 includes a processor 10 for 
processing instructions, a system memory 30, a cache memory 12, and a 

supplemental 26. In response to a first instruction, the supplemental 
memory stores first information from a system memory. In response to a 

second instruction, the cache memory stores second information from the 
supplemental memory if the first information includes the second 

information and from the system memory otherwise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information processing system,
and in particular to one having a system memory and a cache memory.Many systems for processing information include both a system
memory and a cache memory. A cache memory is a relatively small highspeed
memory that stores a copy of information from one or more portions
of the system memory. Frequently, the cache memory is physically
distinct from the system memory. Such a cache memory can be integral
with a processor device of the system or be non-integral with the
processor.Information can be copied from a portion of the system memory into
the cache memory. The information in the cache memory can be modified.
Further, modified information from the cache memory can be copied back to
a portion of the system memory.In response to instructions, execution units of the processor are
able to process information stored in the cache memory. Such
instructions include memory instructions for transferring data
information between the cache memory and registers of the processor. In
a cache miss situation where information for a memory instruction (such
as a "load/store" instruction or a "read/write" instruction) is not
stored in the cache memory, such information is requested from the system
memory. A significant amount of delay can occur while waiting for
information from the system memory in response to a cache miss situation.To reduce negative consequences of such a cache miss situation, the
processor can support a prefetch instruction (such as a "touch load"
instruction) for loading the cache memory with data information from a
specified address within the system memory well in advance of the
information being used for another instruction of the processor.
Nevertheless, if the prefetch instruction itself results in a cache miss
situation, and if the cache memory is a "blocking" cache memory, then
additional memory instructions are blocked from using the cache memory
until information is received from the system memory. The additional
memory instructions are blocked irrespective of whether they specify
information already stored in the cache memory. Accordingly, with previous blocking cache memories, such a prefetch
instruction is relatively ineffective and possibly even degrades the
performance of the processor. With previous techniques, a prefetch
operation is significantly less practical unless the cache memory is made
non-blocking. In a non-blocking cache memory, additional memory
instructions are not blocked from using the cache memory if

<CLAIMS>
An information processing system (10) in which a processor (16)
processes instructions, said system including:


a system memory (30) for storing information;
a supplemental memory (26) coupled to said system memory for
accessing and storing first information from said system memory in

response to a prefetch instruction; and
a cache memory (12) coupled to said supplemental and system
memories for accessing and storing second information in response to a

memory instruction, said second information being from said system memory
if said first information does not include said second information;
and 
characterised in that
 if said first information does include
said second information, then said cache memory accesses said second

information from said supplemental memory.
The system of Claim 1 wherein said cache memory is a blocking cache
memory.
The system of Claim 1 or 2 wherein said cache memory is integral
with said processor.
The system of any preceding Claim wherein said supplemental memory
is integral with said processor.
The system of any preceding Claim wherein said supplemental memory
is a prefetch memory.
The system of Claim 5 wherein said first instruction is a prefetch
instruction.
The system of any preceding Claim wherein said second information
from said system memory is stored in said cache memory without adding

said second information to said supplemental memory.
The system of any preceding Claim, further including means (20)
coupled to said supplemental memory for maintaining coherency of said

first information in said supplemental memory.
The system of any preceding Claim wherein said supplemental memory
is smaller than said cache memory. 
The system of any preceding Claim wherein said supplemental memory
is smaller than said system memory.
The system of any preceding Claim wherein said supplemental memory
stores said first information in response to said first instruction

having a first instruction type.
The system of Claim 11 wherein said cache memory stores said second
information in response to said second instruction having a second

instruction type.
