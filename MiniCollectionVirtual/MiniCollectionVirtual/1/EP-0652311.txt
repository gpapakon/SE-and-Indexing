<ABSTRACT>
A weaving loom of the kind comprising a carrier (6) for at 
least one shuttle (5, 5') and a stationary frame (1) 

accommodating a reed of wires or dents (7) disposed in a plane 
extending parallel to the direction of movement of the shuttle 

carrier (6) to guide the warp threads to a place where the 
weft thread is introduced by means of the shuttle. A freely 

rotatable toothed wheel (4) being mounted on the shuttle 
carrier (6) in front of the corresponding shuttle, at an angle 

to the reed plane and in engagement with the reed wires or 
dents (7) to form a shuttle shed. The toothed wheel (4) is 

mounted on the opposite side of the reed plane with respect to 
the shuttle arrangement in order to provide better space for 

the shuttle arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to weaving looms of the
type comprising a carrier for at least one shuttle and a
stationary frame carrying reed wires or dents positioned in a
plane extending parallel to the direction of movement of the
shuttle for the purpose of guiding the warp threads towards a
point where the weft thread is to be inserted by means of the
shuttle.For introducing the weft threads, i.e. for passing the
shuttle in the correct relationship to the individual warp
threads, the warp threads must be separated so as to form a
warp shed between them. A number of shed forming mechanisms
for this purpose are of course known, one example being
described in British Patent 1.351.059, in which the shed
formation is effected by means of a freely rotatable toothed
wheel carried by a shuttle carrier, the individual warp
threads being received on the top of a tooth of said wheel or
in the space between two such teeth.The present invention is aimed at a weaving loom of the
character referred to, specifically of the circular type (but
it may also be employed on looms of the flat type). According
to the invention, the toothed wheel, also referred to as the
shedding wheel, is positioned on the opposite side of the reed
wires or dents with respect to the shuttle carrier. In such
arrangement, there is space for more shuttles with less
spacing between adjacent shuttles, and also space for larger
weft spools, and because of the more compact structure it is
possible to operate with higher weaving rates.The invention is illustrated by way of example with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which
Fig. 1 illustrates the arrangement of the toothed wheel and
reed wires or dents relative to each other in a weaving loom,
as seen in the direction of movement of the shuttle carrier
(arrow A in Fig. 2), andFig. 2 is a view corresponding to that in Fig. 1, as seen in
the direction of the arrow B in Fig. 1.In the drawing, reference 1 denotes the stationary frame
of a weaving loom and reference 2 denotes a guide means for
warp threads 3. A shuttle is indicated at 5. The shuttle spool
proper is not shown, but the shuttle carrier is indicated at
6. The frame 1 accommodates a reed in the form of wires or
dents 7 which are disposed parallel to one another and are
located in a plane extending parallel to the direction of
movement of the shuttle carrier 6. The reed serves to guide
the warp threads 3 into a position to permit shedding and the
introduction of the weft threads by means of the shuttle.In order to provide the shed
