<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for the preparation of condensed 1m1dazolesThe invention relates to a process for preparing certain fused imidazole derivatives and in particular for preparing chiral fused imidazole derivatives.European Patent Application, Publication No. 0,335,483 discloses certain fused imidazole derivatives of formula (A):wherein,Ra is hydrogen, Cι_ alkyl, CHRdCONHRe or CHRdC00Re in which R<* and Re are each hydrogen or Cι__4 alkyl;R" is hydrogen, C1.5 alkyl or any residue R" of an amino acid RbCH(NH2)COOHRc is hydrogen, Cχ.4 alkyl, CONH2 or Cθ2R^in which R^ is hydrogen or C .4 alkyl; andm is 2, 3 or 4.EP 0,335,483 also discloses a process for preparing the compounds of formula (A) which involves either:a) reacting a compound of formula (B) with a compound of formula(C): 
wherein Ra, RD, Rc, and m are as defined in relation to formula (A), RS is hydrogen and Rn is hydrogen, Cι_4 alkyl or benzyl; orb) cyclising a compound of formula (D):
 where in Ra, RD, Rc and are as defined in relation to formula (A) and £ and Rn are as defined in relation to formulae (B) and (C).The compounds of formula (A) are disclosed in EP 0,335,483 as having activity as nootropic reagents.EP 0,335,483 also discloses that the compounds of formula (A) can contain one or more chiral carbons. In particular it is to be noted that the bridgehead carbon of formula (A) is always a chiral carbon.A process has now been discovered which facilitates the preparation of certain compounds of formula (A) and in particular facilitates the preparation of individual optical isomers of such compounds in which the chiral carbon is the bridgehead carbon.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (I):
whereinR1 represents hydrogen, C1.4 alkyl, CHR3CONHR4 or CHRSCOOR4 in which 3 and R4 each independently represent hydrogen or Cχ_4 alkyl; R2 represents hydrogen or Cχ_5 alkyl; and n is an integer 2, 3 or 4;which process comprises cyclising a compound of formula (II):R2(IDwherein R^ and n are as defined in relation to formula (I); 5 represents hydrogen or a group COOR' wherein ifl is a C1.4 alkyl group or a benzyl group; and R" represents a hydroxy group or a group ORB wherein R° represents C^.g alkyl or a benzyl group; and thereafter, as necessary, carrying out one or more of the following steps:i) removing any protecting group; andii) converting a compound of formula (I) into another compound of formula (I).Suitably the cyclisation is effected by a cyclising reagent.In certain circumstances, the
