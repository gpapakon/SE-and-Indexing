<ABSTRACT>
The set of structural elements exhibits at least two rectangular panels (6, 7, 8) which are connected to one another in a water-tight manner and adjoin one another by one of their two longitudinal sides in each case. For a simple and rapid assembly of a pallet, it is provided that one of the two adjoining longitudinal sides forms a cross-sectionally U-shaped, upwardly open channel (13) and the other forms a downwardly angled-off rib (16) whose height is smaller than the depth of the channel (13), and that a sealing strip (18) with a longitudinal groove (19) for receiving the rib (16) is provided and can be pressed into the channel (13) under elastic compression.

A set of prefabricated parts for producing the base of a plant pallet (5) comprising at
least two rectangular panels (6, 7, 8) which are to be joined to each other in a water-tight

manner and which adjoin each other at one of their two longitudinal sides in each case,
wherein one of the two mutually adjoining longitudinal sides forms a channel (13) which is

U-shaped in cross-section and is open at the top and the other forms a downwardly bent rib
(16), characterised in that the height of the rib is less than the depth of the channel (13), and

that a sealing strip (18) is present which has a longitudinal slot (19) for receiving the rib (16)
and which can be pressed into the channel (13) under elastic compression.
A set of prefabricated parts according to claim 1, characterised in that the side flanks
of the sealing strip (18) and of the longitudinal slot (19) comprise longitudinal grooves (20)

which form lamellae and which have a saw-tooth profile, so that the lamellae are set back
when the rib (16) is pressed into the longitudinal slot (19) or when the sealing strip (18) is

pressed into the channel (23) and are spread apart in the manner of barbs when the sealing
strip (18) is removed.
A set of prefabricated parts according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in the
region of its free longitudinal edge the rib (16) is bent off at right angles towards the adjacent

panel (8).
A set of prefabricated parts according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the region of the free edge of the channel (13) of U-shaped profile has a portion bent off

at right angles (15) for supporting the adjoining panel (7).
A plant pallet (5) having a supporting frame (9) in which a base is inserted which
comprises at least two panels (6, 7, 8) and which is produced with the set of prefabricated

parts according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the panels (6, 7, 8) adjoin each other
at one of their longitudinal sides in each case, wherein one of the two mutually adjoining 

longitudinal sides forms a channel (13) which is U-shaped in cross-section and is open at the
top and the other forms a downwardly bent rib (16), characterised in that the height of the

rib is less than the depth of the channel (13), and that a sealing strip (18) is present which
has a longitudinal slot (19) f
or receiving the rib (16) and which can be pressed into the
channel (13) under elastic compression.
A plant pallet according to claim 5, characterised in that the edges of the panels (6,
7, 8) which adjoin the frame (9) are oriented upwards on the frame (9).
