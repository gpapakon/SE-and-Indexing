<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates generally to a method for eliminating ringing while
measuring nuclear magnetic resonance properties of an earth formation traversed by a

borehole. The measurement can be made while drilling or using a wireline tool. During a
first time period of a single pulse sequence, the measurement includes the desired spin-echoes

and the undesired effects, that is, ringing, measurement noise, and baseline shift.
During a second time period of the single pulse sequence, the spin-echoes are eliminated

but not the undesired effects. Using the signal collected during the second time period,
the signals measured during the first time period are corrected to eliminate the ringing

component , measurement noise, and baseline shift.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a method for measuring nuclear magnetic resonance properties of an earth formation traversed by a borehole, and more particularly, to a method for eliminating any ringing, such as magnetoacoustic ringing, and/or a baseline offset during a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement.Borehole nuclear magnetic resonance measurements provide different types of information about a reservoir. First, the measurements provide an indication of the amount of fluid in the formation. Second, the measurements present details about whether the fluid is bound by the formation rock or unbound and freely producible. Finally, the measurements can be used to identify the type of fluid - water, gas, or oil.One approach to obtaining nuclear magnetic resonance measurements employs a locally generated static magnetic field, Bo, which may be produced by one or more permanent or electromagnets, and an oscillating magnetic field, B1, which may be produced by one or more RF antennas, to excite and detect nuclear magnetic resonance to determine porosity, free fluid ratio, and permeability of a formation. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,717,878 issued to Taicher et al. and 5,055,787 issued to Kleinberg et al. Nuclear spins align with the applied field Bo with a time constant of T1 generating a nuclear magnetic moment. The angle between the nuclear magnetization and the applied field can be changed by applying an RF field, B1 , perpendicular to the static field Bo. The frequency of the RF field is equal to the Larmor frequency given by ω0=γB0 where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. After application of an RF pulse, the magnetization begins to precess around B0 and produces a detectable signal in the antenna. The signal detected by the antenna includes a parasitic, spurious ringing that interferes with the measurement of spin-echoes.The source of the spurious signal is electromagnetic generation of ultrasonic standing waves in metal. See E. Fukushima and S.B.W. Roeder, Spurious Ringing in Pulse NMR, 33 J. MAGN. RES. 199-203 (1979). As explained in the Fukushima et al. article, the induced RF current within the skin depth of the metal interacts with the lattice in a static magnetic field through the Lorenz force and the coherent ultrasonic wave propagates into the metal to set up a standing wave. A reciprocal mechanism converts the acoustic energy, in the presence of the static field, to an oscillating magnetic field which is picked up by the antenna as a spurious, ringing signal.Document E.

A method for eliminating an undesired signal component while measuring a nuclear magnetic resonance property of earth formations surrounding a borehole, comprising the steps of:

a) applying a static magnetic field in a volume of the formation which polarizes the spin nuclei within the volume of formation;
b) applying oscillating magnetic fields in the volume of formation according to a selected pulse sequence for a plurality of cycles so that nuclear magnetic resonance signals are generated in the volume of formation;
c) during a single pulse sequence cycle, step (b) further comprises the steps of:

i) during a first time period, applying a first plurality of oscillating pulses in the volume of formation and measuring the generated signals in the formation, the measured signals comprising a plurality of spin-echoes and an undesired signal component superimposed thereon, wherein the undesired signal component is a ringing component and/or a baseline offset;
ii) canceling the spin-echoes;
iii) during a second time period, applying a second plurality of oscillating pulses in the volume of formation and measuring the generated signals in the formation, the measured signals comprising the undesired signal component and excluding the spin-echoes; and,
