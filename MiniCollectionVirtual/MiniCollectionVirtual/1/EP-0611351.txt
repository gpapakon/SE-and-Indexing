<ABSTRACT>
A combination solenoid valve and shuttle valve (60) particularly for use in an anti-lock braking system comprising a shuttle valve (50) which is slidingly and sealingly received adjacent an end of the solenoid valve (40). The shuttle valve (50) includes a stepped interior opening (54) which sealingly receives the end of the solenoid valve (40), such that slidable movement of the shuttle valve (50) causes an insert (55) within the interior opening (54) to seat sealingly over a solenoid insert seat (41C) in order to isolate a master cylinder (12) from a wheel brake (16). The shuttle valve (50) includes a one way build orifice (30), which permits restricted fluid flow between a pressure source (18) and the wheel brake (16), a feedback orifice (36, 36A) which permits restricted fluid flow from the pressure source (18) to the master cylinder (12), a pump check valve (23) which prevents fluid flow from the shuttle valve (50) back toward the pressure source (18), a poppet check valve or floating feedback washer (38, 38A) which permits fluid flow from the master cylinder (12) toward the wheel brake (16) and bypassing the feedback orifice (36, 36A), a release flow communication (21) permitting, upon brake release, fluid to flow from the wheel brake (16) directly toward the master cylinder (12), a check valve (29) which permits fluid to bypass the shuttle valve (50) by flowing from the wheel brake (16) to the master cylinder (12), and a check valve floating washer or build poppet (32, 32A) which permits fluid flow from the wheel brake (16) to the master cylinder (12) via the feedback orifice (36, 36A), bypassing the build orifice (30, 30A).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
combination solenoid valve and shuttle valve, and in 
particular to an electrically operated valve mechanism for 
an adaptive braking system. Numerous adaptive braking systems have been 
proposed previously. Adaptive braking systems can 
typically include numerous solenoid valves, check valves, 
flow restrictions, shuttle valves, and various types of 
pressure source mechanisms. In adaptive braking systems 
which utilize solenoid valves and shuttle valves, it is 
highly desirable to combine structurally a solenoid valve 
with its respective shuttle valve. Combined solenoid valve 
and shuttle valve structures are disclosed in U. S. Patents 
Nos. 4,620,565; 4,844,119; and 4,936,344. The combined 
structure has the potential for greatly simplifying the 
number and complexity of plumbing connections, and 
substantially reducing the cost of the entire system. It 
is desirable to provide a combination solenoid valve and 
shuttle valve structure which can be easily packaged 
together and which provides a complexity of functions that 
significantly exceeds the functions illustrated in Brown U. 
S. Patent No. 4,620,565, Martinic U. S. Patent No. 
4,844,119 and Gilbert et al. U. S. Patent No. 4,936,344. 
The complexity of functions that are desired may comprise 
the equivalent of numerous check valves, fluid flow 
restrictions, fluid pressure connections, and springs 
utilized in the check valve structures. The present invention provides solutions to the 
above problems by providing a combination solenoid valve 
and shuttle valve, comprising a body having therein a bore 
comprising a first bore section, second bore section, and 
third bore section sealingly isolated from one another at 
the perimeter of the bore, the solenoid valve disposed 
within the bore and operable to open a valve therein in 
order to communicate said second bore section with said 
third bore section, shuttle valve disposed sealingly and  
 
slidably within said first and second bore sections, and 
the bore communicating at one end with a pressure source, 
characterized in that the shuttle valve has an interior 
opening which is received sealingly and slidably at an end 
of said solenoid valve, and the shuttle valve slidable to 
cooperate with said end of the solenoid valve in order to 
direct fluid from the pressure source primarily to the 
valve of the solenoid valve. The invention is described in detail below with 
reference to the drawings which illustrate embodiments in 
which:
