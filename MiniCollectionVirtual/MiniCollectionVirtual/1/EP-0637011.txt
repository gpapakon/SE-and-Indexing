<ABSTRACT>
A speech signal discrimination arrangement (70) has an input (1) for 
receiving an audio signal and an output (5) for supplying a probability indication signal 

V
P
 which is indicative of the probability that the audio signal received 
via
 the input (1) 
is a speech signal. An analyzing circuit (2) derives an analysis signal (NA) which is 

indicative of the ratio between a signal power in a first portion of a frequency spectrum 
of the received signal and a signal power in a second portion of the frequency spectrum. 

A signal pattern detector (3) detects signal patterns in the analysis signal (NA) for 
which the probability that they occur in a speech signal differs from the probability that 

they occur in another signal, for example a music signal. Estimator means (4) derive the 
probability indication signal V
P
 in dependence on the detected signal patterns. 
The speech signal discrimination arrangement (70) is used in an audio device for 

processing a received audio signal. The audio device comprises an audio signal 
processing circuit (71) for processing the received audio signal in a manner which 

depends on the probability indication signal V
P
 generated by the speech signal 
discrimination arrangement (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a speech signal discrimination arrangement having
an input for receiving an audio signal and an output for supplying a probability
indication signal which is indicative of the probability that the audio signal received via
the input is a speech signal.The invention further relates to an audio device including such a speech
signal discrimination arrangement.A speech signal discrimination arrangement and an audio device of the
types defined above are known from Rundfunktechnische Mitteilungen; Band 12; 1968,
Heft 6, pp. 288-291. The known speech signal discrimination arrangement is adapted to
discriminate speech signals from music signals in a radio receiver. When a speech
signal is detected the received signal is processed to improve the intelligibility of the
reproduced speech signal. When a music signal is detected the received signal is
subjected to a process which is particularly suitable for use in the case of the reception
of music signals.The known speech signal discrimination arrangement utilises the fact that
the amplitude of music signals in general decreases gradually whereas the amplitude of
speech signals in general decreases abruptly. These gradual decreases are detected and a
signal producing a pulse upon each detection is integrated. This integrated signal
indicates whether the received audio signal is a speech signal or a music signal. A
drawback of the known discrimination arrangement is that in a comparatively large
number of cases (3 %) the integrated signal does not provide a correct indication of the
type (music or speech) of audio signal received.It is an object of the invention to provide a speech signal discrimination
arrangement which enables a more reliable discrimination between speech signals and
music signals to be obtained.According to the invention this object is achieved by means of a speech
signal discrimination arrangement which is characterised by an analyzing circuit for
deriving an analysis signal which is indicative of the ratio between a signal power in a 
first portion of a frequency spectrum of the received signal and a signal power in a
second portion of the frequency spectrum, a signal pattern detector for detecting signal
patterns in the analysis signal for which the probability that they occur in a speech
signal differs from the probability that they occur in another signal not being a speech
signal, and estimator means for deriving the probability indication signal in dependence
upon the detection of the signal patterns.The invention

above a given upper threshold to a level below a given lower threshold, means for

device comprises a speech signal discrimination arrangement as claimed in any one of

the preceding Claims, the audio device comprising means for processing the received
