<ABSTRACT>
A transparent solid detergent containing an N-acylglutamic acid salt, wherein the salt comprises a potassium 
salt and a sodium salt with the degree of neutralization of 1.5 to 2.0 in a molar ratio of the salts of 9:1 to 2:8 and in 

a total content of the salts of 30-70 wt.%. It is lowly irritative against the skin, etc., mild to the touch, and excellent 
in shelf stability and usability, thus being particularly suitable as a facial cleansing soap.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to N-acylglutamic acid salt-containing
solid detergent compositions with mild action on
skin and hair, and more specifically to N-acylglutamic acid
salt-containing transparent solid detergents with improved
storage stability while maintaining usabilities such as
sudsing or detergency.Transparent soap (transparent solid detergents) is
commercially valuable because of the high-grade impression
by its transparency. Most of prior transparent solid
detergents are made from higher fatty acid soap as the base
and transparentizers such as glycerin, sucrose or sorbitol.
They are made by framing or milling, and in general,
framed transparent soap has better transparency than milled
soap. However, framing is not suitable for mass production
because it takes about one month to obtain a stabilized
shape. Moreover, it is known that higher fatty acid soap-based
transparent soap made by these processes is not
essentially different from ordinary opaque soap, that the
former has the same drawbacks as the latter, e.g.,
irritation to skin, poor sudsing in hard water, and that it
may opacify in use.JPA55-25465 (i.e., Japanese patent application laid-open
(tokkai) No. Sho 55-25465), discloses transparent solid
detergents based on N-long chain acyl acidic amino acid
salts, and JPA56-76499 discloses a method of manufacturing 
milled transparent solid detergents using N-long chain
acylglutamic acid salts.However, such transparent solid detergents disclosed
in these patent documents have low storage stability,
because the triethanolamine salt or the sodium salt is used
as the N-long chain acylglutamic acid salt. Thus, the
triethanolamine salt-based detergents become browned when
stored at high temperatures, and the sodium salt-based
detergents gradually crystalize during storage and finally
opacify. Moreover, these transparent solid detergents still
need further improvement on their usabilities such as
sudsing, disintegration or adhesion.In view of the prior art described above, an object of
this invention is to provide N-long chain acylglutamic acid
salt-containing transparent solid detergents which have
improved usabilities such as sudsing, disintegration or
adhesion, while maintaining storage stability in
connection with their transparency and non-coloration, and
which are less irritant to skin, hair or ocular mucosa.As the results of elaborate studies to attain the
above object, the present inventors have found that less
irritant transparent solid detergents which are free from
coloration and
