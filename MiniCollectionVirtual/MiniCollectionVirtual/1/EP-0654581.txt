<ABSTRACT>
A sub-surface release plug assembly for use in 
cementing an outer casing annulus around a well casing has 

an upper plug (160) including non-metallic material, e.g. 
high-strength engineered plastics. The assembly includes 

the upper plug (160), a lower plug (232), a collet (126) for 
interconnecting the upper plug (160) with a drill string 

(14), a releasing sleeve slidably disposed with respect to 
the collet to release the collet when moved from a first to 

a second position, and a releasing plug (264) for engaging 
the releasing sleeve to enable movement of the latter under 

differential pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sub-surface release 
plugs apparatus for use in cementing of the outer casing 
annulus of a wellbore. Typically, sub-surface release plugs positioned in 
the upper portion of a well casing below a casing hanger and 
attached to the lower end of a drill string are used in 
cementing operations for cementing a casing annulus adjacent 
a shoe joint. The construction and use of such plugs is 
disclosed in our U.S. patent specifications nos. 4,809,776 
and 4,934,452, to which reference should be made. Another 
prior art sub-surface release plug assembly is disclosed in 
Halliburton Services Sales & Service Catalog No. 43, pages 
2424-2426. Typically, a bottom plug of the assembly is 
released, and cement is pumped into the casing above the 
bottom plug, forcing the bottom plug downwardly until it 
comes to rest at  
 
the upper end of the shoe joint. The bottom plug seals 
against the inner surface of the casing so that mud below the 
bottom plug and cement above the bottom plug are not mixed. 
Once the bottom plug has reached its lowermost position, a 
passageway in the bottom plug is opened to allow cement to 
pass therethrough. The cement then passes through a float 
collar and/or float shoe and an opening at the lower end of 
the shoe joint in the casing annulus. A valve in the float 
collar and/or float shoe prevents reverse movement of the 
cement through the casing. When the proper amount of cement has been introduced into 
the casing and drill string, a releasing dart or drill pipe 
plug is dropped into the drill string. The releasing dart 
engages a latching mechanism above the top plug, thus closing 
off the central opening of the top plug and releasing it from 
the drill string. The fluid pumped into the drill string 
forces the top plug, and the dart or drill pipe plug latched 
thereto, down toward the bottom plug, forcing the cement 
through the shoe joint. The top plug stops when it contacts 
the bottom plug. Once the cement has set, the top and bottom plugs are 
drilled out of the casing. Mating teeth on the upper and 
lower plugs prevent relative rotation therebetween so the top 
plug does not merely rotate when contacted by a drill bit. 
Most prior art sub-surface plug assemblies use metallic 
components, and the drill bits used to drill the components 
out of the casing must be adapted for cutting such materials.  
 
Typically, standard "tri-cone" rotary drill bits are used with 
appropriate loading applied thereto. Such prior drillable 
devices have worked well,
