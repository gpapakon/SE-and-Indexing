<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor device has a connection electrode 

(4) and protective film (7) formed of organic material 
and covering the connection electrode (4). An opening 

(8) is formed in the protective film (7) to expose the 
connection electrode (4). A natural oxide layer is 

etched by argon-based dry etching. The surface layer of 
the protective film (7) is altered to reduce the 

insulativity in the dry etching process. After a 
projection electrode (14) is formed on the connection 

electrode (4) later, the altered surface layer of the 
protective film (7) is removed by oxygen-based dry 

etching. As no altered surface layer remain on the 
protective film (7), an adverse affect such as 

inadequate insulation does not occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
fabricating a semiconductor device.There is a semiconductor device (IC chip) mounting
scheme called a TAB (Tape Automated Bonding) system by
which a semiconductor device is mounted on a TAB tape.
In this case, bump electrodes provided on a
semiconductor device are connected to finger leads
(inner leads) on the TAB tape by gold-tin eutectic
bonding, gold-gold thermo-compression bonding or the
like.Semiconductor devices are generally designed in
such a form that connection electrodes formed on a
silicon wafer (semiconductor device body or die chip)
are exposed through an opening formed in a passivation
film formed on the silicon wafer. Bump electrodes
(projection electrodes) are formed on the connection
electrodes. The connection electrodes are made of a
base metal such as aluminum or aluminum alloy. In
fabricating a semiconductor device with such a
structure, an insulative natural oxide layer formed on
the surface of each connection electrode can be removed
before a bump electrode is
formed on the connection electrode.
A method similar to this is described in EP-A-0 316 912. The oxide
removal process can be performed with argon ions by dry etching.To better protect the surface of a semiconductor
device, the structure, in which a protective film made
of polyimide is formed on the passivation film made of
silicon nitride or the like, is proposed. In
fabricating a semiconductor device with this structure,
dry etching with argon ions is carried out to remove the
natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the
connection electrode, after the protective film made of
polyimide is formed. The surface layer of the
protective film is altered and deteriorated by the argon
ions. This decreases the insulating resistance to 
result in inadequate insulation, so that electric
leakage or short-circuiting may at last occur between
the adjoining connection electrodes.JP-A-2246246 describes a provision of a connection electrode
covered with an organic polyimide film. This organic film has an opening
on the surface of the substrate, at least a part of the surface
of the connection electrode being exposed through said opening.
Remaining residue of the organic layer is removed with the
help of a sputter cleaning process before an additional layer is
applied.JP-A-58043540 and JP-A-5013585 describe the provision of
projection electrodes projecting from the surface of the device.
