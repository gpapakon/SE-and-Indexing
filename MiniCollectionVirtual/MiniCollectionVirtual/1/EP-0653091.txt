<ABSTRACT>
A discriminator (24) discriminates between stationary and non-stationary signals. The energy E(Ti) of the input signal is calculated in a number of windows Ti. These energy values are stored in a buffer (52), and from these stored values a test variable VT is calculated (54). This test variable comprises the ratio between the maximum energy value and the minimum energy value in the buffer. Finally, the test variable is tested against a stationarity limit  gamma . If the test variable exceeds this limit the input signal is considered non-stationary. This discrimination is especially useful for discriminating between stationary and non-stationary background sounds in a mobile radio communication system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to discriminating
between stationary and non-stationary signals, especially
to detect whether a signal representing
background sounds in a mobile radio communication system is
stationary. The invention is used
for detecting and encoding/decoding
stationary background sounds.Many modern speech coders belong to a large class of speech
coders known as LPC (Linear Predictive Coders). Examples of
coders belonging to this class are: the 4,8 Kbit/s CELP from the
US Department of Defense, the RPE-LTP coder of the European
digital cellular mobile telephone system GSM, the VSELP coder of
the corresponding American system ADC, as well as the VSELP coder
of the pacific digital cellular system PDC.These coders all utilize a source-filter concept in the signal
generation process. The filter is used to model the short-time
spectrum of the signal that is to be reproduced, whereas the
source is assumed to handle all other signal variations.A common feature of these source-filter models is that the signal
to be reproduced is represented by parameters defining the output
signal of the source and filter parameters defining the filter.
The term "linear predictive" refers to the method generally used
for estimating the filter parameters. Thus, the signal to be
reproduced is partially represented by a set of filter parameters.The method of utilizing a source-filter combination as a signal
model has proven to work relatively well for speech signals. However, when the user of a mobile telephone is silent and the
input signal comprises the surrounding sounds, the presently
known coders have difficulties to cope with this situation, since
they are optimized for speech signals. A listener on the other
side of the communication link may easily get annoyed when
familiar background sounds cannot be recognized since they have
been "mistreated" by the coder.According to swedish patent application 93 00290-5
this problem is solved by
detecting the presence of background sounds in the signal
received by the coder and modifying the calculation of the filter
parameters in accordance with a certain so called anti-swirling
algorithm if the signal is dominated by background sounds.However, it has been found that different background sounds may
not have the same statistical character. One type of background
sound, such as car noise, can be characterized as stationary.
Another type, such as background babble, can be characterized as
being non-stationary. Experiments have shown that the mentioned
anti-swirl
