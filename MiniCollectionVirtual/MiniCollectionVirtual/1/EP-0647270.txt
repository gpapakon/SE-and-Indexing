<DESCRIPTION>
All eucaryotic cells, both plant and animal, have a
nucleus surrounded by the cell cytoplasm. The nucleus
contains the cellular DNA complexed with protein and
termed chromatin. The chromatin, with its associated
proteins, constitutes the major portion of the nuclear
mass and is organized by the internal protein skeleton
of the nucleus, referred to here as the nuclear matrix
(NM). The nuclear matrix also is defined as the
nuclear structure that remains following removal of the
chromatin by digestion with DNase I and extraction with
high salt. This skeletal nuclear structure further is
characterized by the "interior nuclear matrix" (INM)
and the bounding nuclear pore-lamina complex.Diverse studies have implicated the NM in a wide
variety of nuclear functions fundamental to the control
of gene expression (For a general review see, for
example, Fey et al. (1991) Crit. Rev.Euk.Gene
Express1:127-143). In particular, as described in
U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,882,268 and 4,885,236, it is now known
that certain nuclear matrix proteins, specifically
interior nuclear matrix proteins, are useful as marker
proteins for identifying cell types. For example, the
presence and abundance of particular INM proteins have
been shown to be characteristic of specific cell types
and can be used to identify the tissue of origin of a
cell or cell fragment present in a sample. One
particularly important application of this discovery is
the use of marker INM proteins in evaluating metastatic 
tissue. It is also known that the expression of
certain INM proteins is altered in malignant or
otherwise dysfunctional cells. The altered expression
pattern of these proteins in maligrant and/or
dysfunctioning cells also makes the proteins and
nucleic acids encoding the proteins useful as marker
proteins, alone or in combination, for diagnostic
purposes and for evaluating tissue viability. US Pat.
Nos. 4,882,268 and 4,885,236, issued 11/21/89 and
12/5/89, respectively, to Penman and Fey, disclose a
method for selectively extracting insoluble INM
proteins and their associated nucleic acids from cells
or cellular debris and distinguishing the expression.
pattern of these proteins in a particular cell type by
displaying the proteins on a two-dimensional
electrophoresis gel. In addition, it recently has been
discovered that INM proteins or protein fragments also
may be released in soluble form from dying cells. (US
