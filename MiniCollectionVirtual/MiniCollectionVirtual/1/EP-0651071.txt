<ABSTRACT>
Workpieces (parts) made of non-corrosion-resistant metals are provided with a coating, applied by PVD, comprising nitrides, carbides, borides, oxides or silicides of the elements of the 4th to 6th subgroup, a corrosion-resistant interlayer having been applied first. Found to be corrosion-resistant and noble was a layer consisting of a copper-tin alloy comprising from 45 to 80% of copper, from 10 to 55% of tin and from 0 to 15% of zinc, said alloy, furthermore, not giving rise to skin allergy.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of workpieces and items 
made from non-corrosion-resistant metals and metal 

alloys which are coated with wear-resistant non-metallic 
coatings of nitrides, carbides, borides, 

oxides or silicides of elements from groups 4B to 6B 
of the Periodic System of Elements and in which a 

corrosion-resistant intermediate layer is located 
between the surface of the workpiece and the coating,
 
characterised in that
 
an intermediate layer of a copper/tin alloy with 45 to 

80 wt.% of copper, 10 to 55 wt.% of tin and 0 to 
15 wt.% of zinc is first electrodeposited onto the 

item and then the wear-resistant layer is applied by 
means of a PVD process. 
Process according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
a copper/tin alloy with 45 to 65 wt.% of copper and 35 

to 55 wt.% of tin is electrodeposited as the 
intermediate layer. 
A process according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
an alloy of 50 to 80 wt.% of copper, 10 to 35 wt.% of 

tin and 1 to 15 wt.% of zinc is electrodeposited as 
the intermediate layer. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that
 
titanium nitride or titanium carbide is applied as the 

wear-resistant layer.
