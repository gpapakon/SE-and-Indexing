<ABSTRACT>
A unique two piece, hand held, device having an ergonomic and ambidextral hand holder with a detachable, and/or interchangeable, sponge-like, image imprinting element is disclosed. The imprinting element is preferably made of a unitary piece of a sponge body having an ornamental design embossed into the printing face. The embossed printing face is dipped into a paint and the paint is transferred to the desired surface by pressing the printing surface of the sponge body against the surface to be decorated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 WALL DECORATION PAINT APPLYING DEVICEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION a) Field Of The InventionThe present invention relates to an improved printing block type of stenciling device for applying decorative and ornamental designs upon a surface, such as a wall, by transfer-printing various ornamental patterns, designs 

and/or images upon the surface. Although I refer to the device disclosed herein as a stenciling device, it is in reality a type of printing device, typically for applying a pattern of paint onto a surface, such as a wall to simulate wallpaper. b) Description Of The Prior ArtA search of the prior art disclosed the following U.S. Patents :Hampson U.S. Patent No. 1,908,237 Harwood U.S. Patent No. 3,142,082 Joseph U.S. Patent No. 3,280,260 Lambros U.S. Patent No. 3,204,278 Zacha et . al . U.S. Patent No. 3,785,000 Hagen U.S. Patent No. 3,817,178 Briggs U.S. Patent No. 3,843,992 cGuire U.S. Patent No. 4,030,414 Winston U.S. Patent No. 5,431,098 Of the foregoing patents, teaching various stenciling devices, for imprinting a decorative and/or ornamental pattern upon a wall surface, none of the references teach a stenciling device that incorporates means for conveniently exchanging or replacing the stenciling element. Further, 

the foregoing references do not disclose a device that interchangeably and comfortably fits the palm of either the right or left hand whereby the palm of the hand may be effectively used to directly apply the necessary stamping pressure without stressing or otherwise cramping the fingers of the applicator's hand.OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTIONIn view of the foregoing it is an important object of the present invention to provide an ergonomic, ambidextral, hand held, wall stenciling device that is configured to comfortably and interchangeably fit either the right or left hand of a user.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hand held, ergonomic, wall stenciling device where the palm of the user's hand is used to apply a significant portion of the necessary stamping pressure when applying the stencil pattern upon a wall surface, preferably to simulate wallpaper.It is another object of the present invention to 

provide a wall stenciling device constructed so that the stenciling element may be easily and conveniently removed, interchanged and/or replaced.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a wall stenciling device constructed so that the stenciling element may be easily removed for cleaning and storage .SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe

WE claim :
1. A device for applying an ornamental image upon a surface comprising: a) a holder; and b)a resilient, self-restoring sponge-like body having a first interlocking portion being releasibly attached to said holder and a second imprinting portion for applying said ornamental image upon said surface .
2. The device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said holder is configured to be held within the human hand.
3. The device as claimed in claim 2 wherein said holder has a hemi-spherical like configuration.
4. The device as claimed in claim 2 wherein said holder has an asymmetrical configuration.
5. The device as claimed in claim 4 wherein said holder is ambidextral.
6. The device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said holder comprises a dome-like, hollow, concave configuration 


having a circumscribing peripheral lip about its open end, wherein said lip attaches to a corresponding circumscribing peripheral groove in said sponge-like body to mount said sponge-like body to said holder.
7. The device as claimed in claim 6 wherein the interlocking portion of said sponge-like body is configured to completely fill the internal volume of said hollow, concave configuration of said holder.
8. The device as claimed in claim 6 wherein said lip of said holder extends radially inward of said holder.
9. The device as claimed in claim 8 wherein said lip further extends outward beyond the outer periphery of said holder forming a circumferential rim there around.
10. The device as claimed in claim 9 wherein the outer circumferential periphery of said sponge-like body extends slightly beyond said circumferential rim.
11. A paint applying device for applying an ornamental design upon a wall surface comprising in combination: 


 a) an open end, hollow, bowl-like, hand held holder having a planer peripheral flange circumscribing the periphery of said open end, said flange including a radially inward extending lip portion and a radially outward extending rim portion; b) a unitary compressible, self restoring sponge body having a first portion being removably attached to said holder and a second portion having a paint retaining and applying face, said face including relieved portions therein defining an ornamental design to be applied to said wall surface .
12. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 11 wherein said first portion for attaching said sponge body to said holder includes an integral groove circumscribing the periphery of said sponge body at the juncture of said first and
*
 second portions of said sponge body whereby said groove attachingly receives therein the lip of said holder.
13. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 11 wherein said holder is hemi-spherical .
14. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 11 


wherein said holder is asymmetrical.
15. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 14 wherein said holder is ambidextral .
16. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 12 wherein said first portion of said sponge body is configured so as to completely fill an open internal volume of said holder.
17. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 15 wherein said hollow holder includes at least four knob-like protrusions, spaced about the periphery of said radially outward extending rim portion thereby defining areas therebetween for the receipt of the fingers and thumb of either the left or right hand.
18. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 17 wherein said areas between said knob-like protrusions are concave .
19. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 11 wherein said sponge body comprises an open celled, resinous 


foam material .
20. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 11 wherein said first portion of said sponge body completely fills the internal volume of said hollow, bowl-like, hand held holder when said sponge body is attached thereto.
21. A paint applying device for applying an ornamental design upon a wall surface comprising: a unitary compressible, self restoring sponge body having a first portion including an integral groove circumscribing the periphery of said sponge body at the juncture of said first portion and a second portion, said second portion having a paint retaining and applying face, said face including relieved portions therein defining an ornamental design to be applied to said wall surface.
22. The paint applying device as claimed in claim 21 wherein said first portion is adapted for attaching said sponge body to a holder.
