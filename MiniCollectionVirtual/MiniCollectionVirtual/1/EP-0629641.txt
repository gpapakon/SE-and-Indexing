<ABSTRACT>
Chlorine-free, polyfunctional polyisobutenes capable of being modified with amines, alcohols and/or aminoalcohols to produce additives usable in the petroleum field, in particular in engine lubricants and fuels. They are prepared by radical terpolymerisation of isobutene, maleic anhydride and polyisobutene which has a mean content of "exo" terminal double bonds of at least 50 %.
