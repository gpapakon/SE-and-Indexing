<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions comprising 
a vaccine and a vaccine adjuvant. In another aspect 
this invention relates to vaccine adjuvants. In the field of immunology it has been well known 
for many years that immune response to certain antigens 
which are otherwise weakly immunogenic can be enhanced 
through the use of vaccine adjuvants. Such adjuvants 
potentiate the immune response to specific antigens and 
are therefore the subject of considerable interest and 
study within the medical community. A wealth of knowledge concerning the complexity 
and sophistication of immune regulation 
("immunomodulation") has become available in the past 
decade. Coupled with currently available biosynthetic 
and recombinant DNA technology, this knowledge is 
permitting development of vaccines possessing antigenic 
epitopes that were previously impossible to produce. 
For example, currently available vaccine candidates 
include synthetic peptides mimicking streptococcal, 
gonococcal, and malarial antigens. These purified 
antigens are generally weak immunogens, however, that 
require adjuvants in order to evoke protective 
immunity. Unfortunately, however, as detailed below, 
conventional vaccine adjuvants possess a number of 
drawbacks which limit their overall use and 
effectiveness. Over the years, Freund's complete or incomplete 
(i.e., without mycobacteria) adjuvants have been 
considered the classic adjuvants to which most other 
adjuvants are compared. However, clinical use of such 
adjuvants in animals or humans is precluded because 
they produce granulomas at the site of injection; fever  
 
and other toxic effects; and tuberculin 
hypersensitivity. Other materials, such as mineral oil 
and aluminum hydroxide, have also been used as 
adjuvants, but they invariably suffer from 
disadvantages. For example, mineral oil is known to 
produce tissue irritation and to be potentially 
oncogenic. Aluminum hydroxide, the only approved 
adjuvant in the United States, also induces granulomas 
at the inoculation site and furthermore it does not 
effectively induce cell mediated immunity. Moveover, 
many of the adjuvants currently available have limited 
utility because they contain components which are not 
metabolizable in humans. Additionally, most adjuvants 
are difficult to prepare in that they may require time 
consuming procedures and the use, in some cases, of 
elaborate and expensive equipment to formulate a 
vaccine and adjuvant system. For a thorough discussion of various immunological 
adjuvants,
