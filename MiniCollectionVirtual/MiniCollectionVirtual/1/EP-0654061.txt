<DESCRIPTION>
A method of chemical coupling on solid phasesThe present invention relates to a method of modifying the binding properties of the surface of a solid phase on which nucleophilic groups are present, a method of immobilizing a chemical compound to the surface of a solid phase, and the solid phase modified by the method in the form of an article, and the use thereof in solid phase reactions.The technical fieldImmobilization of various chemical compounds to surfaces of solid phases, such as glass and plastic materials or other solid materials, is used in a variety of chemical and biochemical techniques in which the chemical compound is bound to the surface of the solid phase, in order to be able at this locality to form part of solid phase react¬ ions with other chemical compounds. Such solid phase reactions occur e.g. within chromatography, solid phase assays, including biosensors and solid phase peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis, and they are also used in bioreactors. Further, solid phase reactions occur e.g. in chemical surface treatment of biological surfaces, such as teeth, as a step in glueing items thereon.Methods of immobilizing chemical compounds to solid phases are multifarious and depend on the object, but within the fields of application mentioned below the present inven- tion constitutes a clear improvement over the existing techniques, since e.g. the durability of immobilized proteins is improved, the functionality is retained, and it is possible to recognize/immobilize peptides. 

Description of the known artUse of solid phase assay technique, including Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) (Engvall E. and Perlmann P. "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA. Quantitation of specific antibodies by enzyme-labeled anti-immunoglobulin in antigene-coated tubes", J. Immunol, 109: 129-35, 1972) and solid phase radioimmunoassays (RIA), has during recent years been growing strongly for concentration determination of both antigenes and anti¬ bodies. Furthermore solid phase assays and the appertain¬ ing radioactive or non-radioactive detection systems are used in gene probe based hybridization assays and in biosensors.By conventional ELISA or solid phase-RIA-technique antigenes/antibodies are most often immobilized to the solid phase by passive adsorption. Certain proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, haptenes and oligo-/poly- nucleotides can, however, not be immobilized/detected in this way, and other compounds are denatured and destroyed in the adsorption process (Kurki P. and Virtanen I.
