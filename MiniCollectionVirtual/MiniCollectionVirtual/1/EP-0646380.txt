<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an air separator for liquid that contains gas bubbles and is conveyed through a conduit, in particular for separating air bubbles from blood. An air separator of this generic type has an essentially circular cylindrical chamber which is generally arranged vertically and through which blood flows essentially on helical flow paths, so that the gas bubbles are forced in the radial direction to the longitudinal axis of the chamber due to the pressure differences generated by the centrifugal forces that develop. Furthermore, an inflow nozzle and an outflow nozzle are provided. In order to be able to arrange inflow nozzle and outflow nozzle so as to lie coaxially relative to one another in the longitudinal axis of the chamber and thereby to create more favourable installation conditions in a tubing line it is proposed, according to the invention, that a flow guiding component (an inflow distributor) be arranged downstream from the inflow nozzle. This component essentially comprises a rotationally symmetrical basic body whose outer surface (first guide surface) facing the inflowing liquid is geometrically defined by rotation of a curved section about the longitudinal axis of the chamber, guide blades (28, 128) being arranged on the guide surface, which guide blades are bent in planes standing perpendicularly on the longitudinal axis, so that the axially inflowing liquid is deflected such that the desired helical flow path is induced. The air separator according to the invention is particularly suitable for mass production by injection moulding from a transparent plastic, so that an inexpensive pure-grade component that can be easily disposed of and that, moreover, can be simply monitored optically is obtained.

An air separator (10, 110) for gas bubbles, containing fluid conducted through a 

pipe, in particular for the separation of air bubbles from blood, with a chamber (12, 
112) essentially circular and cylindrical in shape, through which the liquid can flow 

in essentially helical flow paths, with the result that the gas bubbles can be pressed in 
a radial direction to the longitudinal axis (L) of the chamber as a result of the 

pressure differentials incurred by the centrifugal forces arising, and with an intake 
nozzle (16, 116) and an outlet nozzle (18, 118),
 
characterised in that the intake nozzle and outlet nozzle are arranged in the 

longitudinal axis of the chamber, that a flow guidance element (24, 124) is arranged 
downstream of the intake nozzle (16, 116), which consists essentially of a 

rotationally symmetrical basic body element (26, 126), the outer surface of which 
(the first deflection surface), turned towards the inflowing liquid, is defined 

geometrically by the rotation of a curve section about the longitudinal axis (L) of 
the chamber, in such a way that the inflowing liquid can initially be conducted 

radially outwards, and that vanes (28, 128) are arranged on the deflection surface 
which are curved in planes standing perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, and 

deflected in such a way that the liquid, on emerging from the influx distributor, 
flows essentially tangential to the circular walls of the chamber. 
An air separator according to Claim 1, characterised in that the curved section 
forming the initial deflection surface (26) is curved in concave fashion. 
An air separator according to Claim 1, characterised in that the curved section 
forming the first deflection surface (126) is a straight section, with the result that the 

basic body element of the flow guidance component is conical. 
An air deflector according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that a 
second flow deflection surface (34, 134) is arranged at a distance from and parallel 

to the first deflection surface. 
An air separator according to Claim 4, characterised in that the height of the vanes 
(28, 128) is dimensioned in such a way that they extend transversely to the direction 

of flow from the first to the second deflection surface. 
An air separator according to one of the foregoing Claims, and Claim 2 in 
particular, characterised in that the chamber (12) is arranged essentially 

perpendicular, and is designed for a throughflow from top to bottom. 
An air separator according to one of Claims 1 to 5, and Claim 3 in particular, 
characterised in that the chamber (112) is arranged essentially perpendicular, and is 

designed for a throughflow from bottom to top.  
 
An air separator according to Claims 3 and 7, characterised in that an immersion 
tube (144) is connected to the outlet nozzle (118) arranged above, the said tube 

extending into the interior of the conically-shaped flow guidance element (124). 
An air separator according to one of Claims 7 or 8, and in accordance with Claim 
4, characterised in that the outer wall (114) of the essentially circular and cylindrical 

chamber (114) feature a connecting conical area (132), the inner face of which 
forms the second deflection surface (134). 
An air separator according to Claim 6, characterised in that the second 
deflection surface (34) is a part of the surface of a flange (32), which is designed as 

one piece with a cover element (22). 
An air separator according to Claim 2, characterised in that the curved section is 
designed as an elliptical section. 
An air separator according to Claim 8, characterised in that the immersion tube 
(144) secures the influx distributor (124).
