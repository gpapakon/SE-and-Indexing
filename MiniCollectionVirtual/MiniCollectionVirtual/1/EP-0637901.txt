<ABSTRACT>
A processing method using a fast atom beam wherein 
a surface of a substrate to be processed is covered with a 

masking member formed with patterned holes and the masking 
member is irradiated with the fast atom beam from a fast 

atom beam generator so that substrate is processed by the 
fast atom beam applied to the surface of the substrate 

through the patterned holes of the masking member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing method
using a fast atom beam wherein a surface of an object to
be processed is covered with a masking member formed with
a patterned hole enabling the surface of the object to be
directly irradiated with a fast atom beam or a combination
of a fast atom beam and light energy or the like through the
patterned hole, thereby forming the patterned shape on the
object.Conventional processing techniques for forming a
patterned shape on an object include cutting procedures
utilizing a cutting tool, a chemical reaction, a converging
beam or the like. In fine pattern processing carried out
in the field of semiconductors in particular, dry etching
and wet etching, which use a resist, are employed.The processing method employed depends on the
material to be processed and also on the processing
dimension and accuracy required. As one example of a
conventional processing method, a fine pattern processing
technique employed in the manufacture of semiconductor
devices, in which high processing accuracy and advanced
surface treating technique are required, will be explained
below.Figs. 9(a) to 9(e) show one example of the process
sequence of the conventional fine pattern processing that
uses a resist. First, a substrate 1 to be processed is
coated with a resist material 2 (Step 1). Next, ultraviolet
rays 4 are applied to the resist material 2 through a
photomask 3, thereby transferring patterned holes 3a formed
in the photomask 3 to the resist material 2 (Step 2). Next,
portions of the resist material 2 which were irradiated
with the ultraviolet rays 4 through the patterned holes 3a
are removed by development (Step 3). Next, portions of
the substrate 1 where no resist material 2 is present are
subjected to anisotropic etching by using ionic or radical 
species in a plasma (Step 4). Finally, the resist material
2 is removed (Step 5). By the above-described process
sequence, holes 1c having the same configuration as that
of the patterned holes 3a in the photomask 3 are formed
in the surface of the substrate 1. Thus, fine pattern
processing is effected. In general, the above-described
process sequence is repeated to fabricate a semiconductor
device on the substrate.However, the conventional method involves a
complicated process, as described above, and suffers from
the problem that it is extremely difficult to accurately
form a structure in which the shapes in a depthwise
direction of processed portions differ from each other.European patent application 0 522 296 discloses an
