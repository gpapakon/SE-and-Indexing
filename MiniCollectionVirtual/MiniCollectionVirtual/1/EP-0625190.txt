<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a novel type of 
gram-negative aerobic rod-shaped bacterium, a vaccine 
derived thereof and with the use of a novel type of 
Gram-negative aerobic rod-like bacterium. In the last decades, in many countries a strong raise in 
both the number of chicken and poultry farms, and in 
addition, an increasing number of animals per farm has 
been seen. This situation has a serious consequence: it 
has caused an increasing need for new and better 
vaccines and vaccination programmes in these countries. 
Nowadays, most animals are immunized against a number of 
diseases of viral, bacterial and parasitic origin. 
Examples of viral diseases in poultry are Newcastle 
Disease, Infectious Bronchitis, Turkey Rhinotracheitis, 
Herpesvirus of Turkeys, Fowlpox, Infectious Bursal 
Disease, etc. Examples of bacterial diseases are Coryza, 
Salmonella infections, Pasteurella multocida infections 
and E. coli infections. A new bacterial respiratory disease has surprisingly 
been observed in chickens and turkeys. 
The disease was seen in chickens that had been 
vaccinated against the bacterium Haemophilus 
paragallinarum; the causative agent of a disease called 
Coryza. Coryza is, as far as known, the only respiratory 
disease in chicken, caused by bacteria belonging to the 
families of Pasteurellaceae and Neisseriaceae. 
The symptoms of this new disease differ from the 
specific symptoms of Coryza. Coryza is mainly an 
infection of the upper respiratory tract. Infected 
animals show a serous to mucoid nasal discharge, facial 
edema and conjunctivitis. They do however not show the 
clinical signs belonging to diseases of the lower  
 
respiratory tract as e.g. airsacculitis or coughing, 
pneumonic lungs or pleuritis. 
Given the fact that the newly discovered disease clearly 
shows the clinical signs of a lower respiratory tract 
infection as described below, H. paragallinarum could be 
ruled out as the causative agent. The newly discovered disease is characterised by the 
following clinical signs in chickens: 
The first indication of this new disease is mild 
snicking. Two or tree days later a small number of 
broilers usually develop a mild nasal discharge and/or 
mild facial edema, which disappear after 2-4 days. 
Snicking continues until the birds are processed. 
Within 1-3 days from the beginning of respiratory 
symptoms, evidence of a reduction in feed intake can be 
detected. This is associated with some increased 
mortality mainly from broilers succumbing with pneumonic 
lungs and
