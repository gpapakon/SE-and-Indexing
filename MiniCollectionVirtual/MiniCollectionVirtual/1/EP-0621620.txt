<ABSTRACT>
A fuse includes an insulative housing (12, 14), 
terminals (16) extending through gaps (30) in the bottom of 

the housing, and a fusible element (18) having ends 
connected to both of the terminals (16). The housing 

includes a four-sided box (12) that is closed at the top 
and open on the bottom, and a lid (14) for closing the open 

bottom of the box that is smaller than the open bottom of 
the box so that, when the lid (14) is in place, two gaps 

are formed in the bottom and at opposite ends of the 
housin

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to current limiting fuses.Current limiting fuses typically have one or more fusible elements connecting two
conducting terminals within an insulative housing. US Patent No. US-A-0 973 250
(Barricklow) describes such a fuse in which the insulative housing is made of porcelain or an
equivalent insulative material. US Patent No. US-A-3 766 507 (Jacobs, Jr.) and US Patent No.
US-A-4 962 977 (Suuronen) describe fuses with box-shaped housings.A fuse according to the precharacterising portion of the present invention is known from
GB-A-2054987.The present invention provides a fuse comprising:
an insulative housing comprising a box having a closed top and an open bottom, and a
lid for closing the box, the lid being smaller than the opening at the bottom of the box to define
two gaps between the lid and the edge of the box through the open bottom;terminals extending through the gaps, each of the terminals having an internal portion
inside the housing and an external portion outside the housing and;a fusible element having ends connected to respective internal portions of the terminals;
characterised in that:the box is generally rectangular with a four-sided structure including first and second
opposite end walls, and in that the gaps through which the terminals extend are at opposite ends
of the open bottom of the box adjacent to the end walls.In preferred embodiments, the box has two circular openings near its top. These
openings are located on opposite sides of the box and are arranged coaxially with each other. A
self-contained indicator for indicating that the fuse has blown is located in and extends between
these holes. The indicator's self-contained design prevents the indicator from being affected by
solid fill binder that can 
be used. It also eases assembly in that the indicator can
be easily inserted into the housing, and the indicator also
serves as a means for properly locating the terminals in the
housing.In a preferred embodiment, each terminal has a first
section and a second section, with the first section being
perpendicular to the second section and located in the
housing. When the terminals are located in the housing, the
first sections of each terminal are parallel to each other.
The first section of each terminal also has a notch located
at its top. This notch serves to make electrical contact
with the self-contained indicator.The box and lid preferably are injection molded
parts made of thermoplastic material and are preferably
attached to each other by welding, most

A fuse comprising:

an insulative housing comprising a box (12) having a closed top and an open bottom,
and a lid (14) for closing the box (12), the lid being smaller than the opening at the bottom of

the box to define two gaps (30) between the lid (14) and the edge of the box through the open
bottom;
terminals (16) extending through the gaps (30), each of the terminals (16) having an
internal portion (26) inside the housing and an external portion (24) outside the housing and;
a fusible element (18) having ends connected to respective internal portions (26) of the
terminals (16); characterised in that:
the box is generally rectangular with a four-sided structure including first and second
opposite end walls, and in that the gaps (30) through which the terminals extend are at opposite

ends of the open bottom of the box adjacent to the end walls.
A fuse according to claim 1, wherein said gaps are provided by recesses (30) in side

edges of said lid (14).
A fuse according to claim 1 or 2, comprising a plurality of fusible elements (18) having
ends connected to respective internal portions (26) of both of said terminals (16).
A fuse according to claim 3, wherein the ends of the fusible elements overlap side edges
of the internal portions of the terminals, and are attached to recessed side surfaces (28) of the

internal portions.
A fuse according to claim 3 or 4, wherein the fusible elements (18) are generally
parallel with the side walls of the box between said end walls. 
A fuse according to any preceding claim, wherein said box (12) has two circular
openings (20) located near the top of said box, said openings (20) being located in opposite

sides of said box and arranged coaxially with each other, and said fuse includes an indicator
(22) located in said box (12) between said circular openings (20).
A fuse according to claim 6, wherein each of the said internal portions (26) of said
terminals (16) are parallel to each other and contain notches (38) that receive and have surfaces

making electrical contact with said indicator (22).
