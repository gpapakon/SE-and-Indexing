<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a solid polymer 
electrolyte having high performances in which the 

reaction area of electrode is increased by uniformly 
dispersing and bonding a solid polymer electrolyte and a 

catalyst and the ability of gas feeding to the reaction 
site is improved by adding a fluoropolymer so that the 

catalyst is not excessively coated. A method for making 
the fuel cell is also provided. The electrode provided 

on at least one side of a solid polymer electrolyte 
membrane is formed by coating on one side of a gas-diffusible 

layer a mixed dispersion of a noble metal 
catalyst, a carbon fine powder and a colloidal dispersion 

of a solid polymer electrolyte, the colloidal 
dispersion being prepared using an organic solvent 

having a polar group other than hydroxyl group in the 
molecule and having a carbon chain of 1-8 carbon atoms 

which bonds to the polar group or having a dielectric 
constant of 3-10.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel cell
which uses as a fuel a reducing agent such as pure
hydrogen or modified hydrogen obtained from methanol or
fossil fuels and as an oxidizing agent air or oxygen,
and more particularly to an assembly of a solid polymer
electrolyte membrane and electrodes, and a method for
the manufacture of the assembly.One of the most important factors which govern
the discharge performance of solid polymer type fuel
cells is the reaction area at an interface of three
phases formed by pores which are passages for feeding of
reaction gas, a solid polymer electrolyte having
protonic conductivity due to containing of water, and an
electrode material of electronic conductor at the
interface between a solid polymer electrolyte membrane
and an electrode.Hitherto, in order to increase the three phase
interface, it has been attempted to apply a layer prepared
by mixing and dispersing an electrode material and
a solid polymer electrolyte to the interface between the
membrane and a porous electrode. For example, Japanese 
Patent Kokoku (Examined Publn.) Nos.62-61118 and
62-61119 disclose a method which comprises coating a
mixture of a solution of solid polymer electrolyte with
a catalyst compound on a solid polymer membrane, hot
pressing the coated membrane on an electrode material
and then reducing the catalyst compound or carrying out
the coating after the reduction and then carrying out
the hot pressing.Japanese Patent Kokoku (Examined Publn.)
No.2-48632 employs a method which comprises molding a
porous electrode, sprinkling a solution of an ion-exchange
membrane resin on the electrode and hot
pressing the electrode and the ion-exchange membrane.
Furthermore, Japanese Patent Kokai (Unexamined Publn.)
No.3-184266 uses a powder prepared by coating a solid
polymer electrolyte on the surface of a polymer resin,
Japanese Patent Kokai (Unexamined Publn.) No.3-295172
employs a method which comprises incorporating a powder
of a solid polymer electrolyte into an electrode.
Japanese Patent Kokai (Unexamined Publn.) No.5-36418
discloses a method which comprises mixing a solid
polymer electrolyte, a catalyst, a carbon powder and a
fluoropolymer and forming the mixture into a film to
form an electrode.All of the above patent publications use
solvents of alcohols for the solutions of the solid
polymer electrolyte. Furthermore, U.S. Patent No.
5,211,984 reports a method which comprises preparing an 
inky dispersion comprising a solid polymer electrolyte,
a catalyst and a carbon powder using
