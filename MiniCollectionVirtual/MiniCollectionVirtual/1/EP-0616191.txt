<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a measuring system for scanning the surface of an object (7) to be measured by means of a distance sensor (1) which scans in a planar fashion. The sensor (1) and the object (7) to be measured are moved relative to one another. The extent (2) of the scanning surface of the sensor (1) in the direction (10) of movement is selected to be larger than the smallest extent (8) of the structure (9) which is still to be determined. With this proportion, the structure (9) is no longer reproduced at full size. In order nevertheless to obtain data on the extent (8) from this no longer correct information, the fraction of the output signal of the sensor (1) which is produced by the structure (9) on the surface of the object to be measured is integrated over the path of the movement.
