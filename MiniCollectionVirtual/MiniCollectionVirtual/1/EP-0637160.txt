<ABSTRACT>
A first computer workstation 10 includes a voice response unit for
interfacing to a telephone network. The first computer workstation is

attached by a communications link 18 to a second computer workstation 20,
which includes a server to perform a particular voice processing

function, such as text to speech, voice recognition, FAX-back, and so on.
For inbound applications the first computer workstation forwards the

incoming signal over the communications link to the server on the second
computer workstation for real-time processing, whilst for outbound

applications, the reverse process occurs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a distributed system for
interactively processing telephone calls.Many systems are currently available for automatically providing
services or information to callers over the telephone. Often referred to
as voice response units (VRUs), such systems have normally relied upon
the use of dual tone multiple frequency (DTMF) signals from push-button
telephones to obtain input from a caller, and responded largely with prerecorded
voice segments. However, such a system is comparatively limited
with respect to the sort of dialogue that can be maintained with the
caller, given the restricted range of acceptable inputs, and the need to
pre-record any possible responses.In order to make such communications more natural, and to greatly
enhance the flexibility of such systems, it is desirable to equip VRUs
with other voice processing technologies, such as voice recognition (to
replace the DTMF input), and text to speech (TTS) (to replace prerecorded
voice). There are many varieties of voice recognition that might
be considered: for example, voice recognition may operate for discrete
words or for continuous speech, and may be speaker dependent, or speaker
independent. Recognition vocabularies can range from perhaps 12 words
(typically ten digits plus a couple of control words) to many thousands.
Likewise, there is a considerable range of TTS technologies available.Voice recognition and TTS applications tend to be computationally
very intensive; for example, full speaker-independent, large vocabulary
voice recognition typically requires 100 Mips of digital signal
processing power. The requirement becomes even more acute when it is
remembered that a VRU may handle perhaps 100 telephone lines
simultaneously, lead to a potential maximum processing requirement of 10
Gips. For this reason most commercial systems use specially designed
hardware to increase processing speed. These are typically available as
PC adapter cards to be fitted into the VRU.However, such cards in general must be designed for a particular
system, dependent for example on the operating system (DOS or OS/2), 
computer architecture (ISA or Microchannel), and so on. This greatly
restricts the options available to the customer who wishes to incorporate
such function into a VRU, since the preferred adapter card may not be
compatible with their VRU. Likewise it is difficult to optimise the
different components of the system individually. The same problems may also
occur even if only software components are involved: for

A method of interactively processing a telephone call in a
distributed system comprising at least first and second computer

workstations (10, 20) connected together by a communications link (18), in
which the first computer (10) is interfaced to the telephone network (12),

said method comprising the steps of:

receiving an incoming telephone signal containing voice data from the
telephone network;
forwarding the incoming telephone signal containing voice data over
the communications link to a server means (74) on the second computer

workstation (20);
processing the voice data in the incoming telephone signal at the
server means and generating a response based upon the telephone signal; and
transmitting the response from the server means to the first computer
workstation, and processing said call at the first computer workstation in

accordance with said response.
The method of claim 1, wherein said server means performs a voice
recognition function.
The method of claim 2, wherein said voice recognition system is
installed on a processing card in the second computer.
A method of interactively processing a telephone call in a
distributed system comprising at least first and second computer

workstations (10, 20) connected together by a communications link (18), in
which the first computer workstation (10) is interfaced to the telephone

network (12), said method comprising the steps of:

receiving an incoming telephone signal over said telephone network;
sending a request over the computer network to a server means (74) on
the second computer workstation (20);
generating a telephone signal containing voice data at the server
means based on said request and transmitting the telephone signal

containing voice data to the first computer workstation; and
forwarding the generated telephone signal containing voice data at
the first computer workstation out over the telephone network.
