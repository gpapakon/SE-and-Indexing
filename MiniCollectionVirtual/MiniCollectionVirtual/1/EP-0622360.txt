<ABSTRACT>
Quinoxolines are prepared by reacting oxalic acid with an o-phenylenediamine, halogenating the product in the presence of a solvent and oxidizing this product to give a quinoxalinecarboxylic acid derivative.

<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing dihalogenoquinoxalinecarboxylic
halides of the formula (I)


characterized in that
 diamines of the formula (II)


where

R
1
 and R
2
are, independently of one another, hydrogen
or C
1
-C
4
-alkyl, are [lacuna] with oxalic acid of

the formula (III)


to give compounds of the formula (IV) 


[lacuna] halogenated [lacuna]

where

Hal
represents Cl, Br,

and these are oxidized using carboxylic acids and metal
halides, or compounds of the formula (V) are oxidized

in the presence of a solvent such as chlorinated
aromatics, tetrachloromethane, phosphorus oxychloride

or thionyl chloride and in the presence of a catalyst
such as pyridine or N,N-disubstituted formamides and in

the presence of a free-radical initiator to give
compounds of the formula (VI)



and these are finally halogenated.
Process according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the substituent CH
3
 in compound (II) is not in the
ortho position relative to the amino groups in formula

(II).
Process according to at least one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 R
1
 and R
2
 are
hydrogen. 
Process according to at least one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
oxidation of the intermediate (V) to (I) is

carried out by reaction with formic acid in the
presence of a catalyst.
