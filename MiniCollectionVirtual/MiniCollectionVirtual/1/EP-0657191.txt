<ABSTRACT>
In a golf ball (1) according to the present invention, 
dimples (2) formed on the surface thereof have the same diameter 

and are classified into first group dimples (2-I) and second group 
dimples (2-II) depending on the depth thereof. The depth of the 

first group dimple (2-I) is from 130% to 280% of that of the second 
group dimple (2-II). Further, the number of the first group dimples 

(2-I) is from 20% to 80% of the total number of the dimples.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a golf ball and
more particularly to a golf ball having dimples of improved
configurations formed on the surface thereof to make air in
the periphery thereof turbulent during the flight thereof, so
as to increase the flight distance thereof with a favorable
aerodynamic symmetrical property maintained even though one
great circle path unintersecting with dimples is formed on a
seam line.Normally, the golf ball has 280 to 540 dimples
formed on the surface thereof. The role of the dimple is to
reduce pressure resistance by shifting a separation point
backward and improve lift by accelerating the difference
between the above separation point and below the separation
point. That is, in order to shift the separation point
backward, it is necessary to make the flow of air in the
periphery of the golf ball turbulent during the flight thereof
to accelerate the transition of the turbulent flow of a
boundary-layer and thereby cause the separation of the
turbulent flow. Thus, it can be said that the dimple capable
of making air in the periphery of the golf ball turbulent is
aerodynamically superior. In view of the role of the dimple, there are
proposals of dimples, of the golf ball, having a function of
making air in the periphery of the golf ball turbulent during
the flight thereof. For example, the following golf balls
were disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publications: (1)
a golf ball having large and small diameter dimples arranged
thereon (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 62-79072);
(2) a golf ball having a plurality of kinds of dimples densely
arranged thereon (Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No.
62-192181); (3) a golf ball having circular and uncircular
dimples arranged thereon in combination with each other
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 5-84328).If a plurality of great circle paths unintersecting
with dimples is formed on the surface of the golf ball, the
area of a land, namely, the area of a region on which dimples
are not formed, increases. As a result, the dimples are
incapable of effectively making air flows turbulent. Thus,
the present applicant proposed (disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Publication No. 04-150875
and in the document EP-A-0 484 612)
a dimple arrangement.
According to this dimple arrangement, dimples formed in an
orderly manner in divided regions formed by geometrically
projecting a regular polyhedron on a spherical surface is
varied such that great circle paths are not present on the
surface of the golf ball except
