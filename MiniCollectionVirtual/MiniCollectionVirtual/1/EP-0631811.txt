<CLAIMS>
Cutting tool for an extrusion machine, particularly for extruding chemical
granules, preferably detergents, with a mould (10) located in the

vicinity of a material discharge opening and with which is associated the
cutting tool (11) mounted in rotary manner and which is constructed in the

manner of an impeller, in which several blades (12) are fitted to a blade
holder (13) and can be guided along a circular path below a planar bearing

surface (15) of the mould (10), characterized in that the cutting edges of
the blades (12) have a negative sweep.
Cutting tool according to claim 1, characterized in that the cutting
edges have a linear construction, so that the negative sweep angle (β) is

constant over the longitudinal extension of the cutting edges.
Cutting tool according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
negative sweep angle (β) is in the range 0 to 20°.
Cutting tool according to one of the claims 2 or 3, characterized in
that the negative sweep angle (β) is approximately 10°.
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the blades (12) have a setting angle (α).
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the blades (12) are constructed as thin, flat plates.
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that the plan view shape of the blades (12) is radially outwardly tapered. 
Cutting tool according to claim 7, characterized in that in plan view
the blades (12) are substantially trapezoidal.
Cutting tool according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in
that she blades (12) have holes (17) distributed over their surface.
