<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a light wood-wool building panel with an open-pored structure of compressed wood-wool in which the wood-wool particles are incrusted at the surface with a binder, with the following features: the incrustation has a foam structure which extends at least partially into the pores of the light wood-wool building panel and is introduced during the panel's shaping process by the infiltration of a foamed binder into a wood-wool random structure which is deformed while its volume is reduced at the same time.

<CLAIMS>
A wood-wool building slab with 

1.1
a skeleton of compressed wood-wool, having open 
pores, 
1.2
the wood-wool particles being incrusted on the 
surface with a binder,
 
characterized by the following features: 
1.3
the incrustation has a foam structure extending at 
least in part into the pores of the wood-wool 

building slab, and 
1.4
having been introduced during the process of forming 
the wood-wool building slab by infiltration of a 

binder foam into a heap of wood-wool being deformed 
simultaneously under volume reduction. 
The building slab according to claim 1, wherein the pore 
volume between the skeleton of compressed wood-wool 

particles is completely filled with the set binder foam. 
The building slab according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
set binder foam has a density between 100 and 700 g/l. 
The building slab according to anyone of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the set binder foam has pores having a mean 

diameter between 0,2 and 5 mm. 
The building slab according to anyone of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein the weight ratio wood-wool : binder foam is from 

1 : 6 to 2 : 1.  
 
The building slab according to anyone of claims 1 to 5 
having a coating of set binder foam, covering the 

surface(s) of the wood-wool building slab. 
A method for producing a wood-wool building slab 
according to anyone of claims 1 to 6, with the following 

steps: 

7.1
a binder foam is deposited onto at least a surface 
portion of a loose heap of wood-wool, 
7.2
the binder foam is infiltrated into the heap of 
wood-wool under simultaneous volume reduction 

thereof to the desired final dimension of the wood-wool 
building slab, 
7.3
the wood-wool building slab compressed in such way 
and infiltrated with the binder foam is held at a 

stable volume until reaching an inherent stability 
(after setting of the binder foam). 
The method according to claim 7, wherein the binder foam 
is deposited onto a heap of wood-wool being delivered 

continuously as a band, and then infiltrates into the 
heap of wood-wool under compression thereof to the 

desired final dimension of the wood-wool building slab. 
The method according to claim 7 or 8, wherein the binder 
foam is deposited between two heaps of wood-wool being 

delivered continuously as bands, and the bands are then 
guided towards each other and compressed to the desired 

final dimension of the slab, under simultaneous 
infiltration of the binder foam into the heap of wood-wool. 
The method according to anyone of claims 7 to 9, wherein 
a binder foam is used, which contains materials varying 

the duration of setting and/or affecting the pore 
structure.
