<ABSTRACT>
A flexible packaging printing ink is formulated from 
a copolymer of polyethyleneneglycol methacrylate and a 

polyamide resin, pigment, solvent and cellulose acetate 
butyrate. The polyamide resin is prepared by
 condensing 
a dibasic acid mixture with a diamine mixture. The 

dibasic acid mixture comprises about 0.5 to 0.8 
equivalents of a C₂₀-C₄₄ dibasic acid mixture comprised of 

about 60 to 100 % dimers, 0 to 40 % trimers and 0 to 5% 
monomers, and about 0.2-0.7 equivalents of at least one 

C₆-C₁₂ dibasic acid such as azelaic acid and adipic acid, 
while the diamine mixture comprises about 0.5-0.8 

equivalents of piperazine or a substituted piperazine and 
the balance comprises at least one C₂-C₁₂ alkylene 

diamine other than piperazine or substituted piperazine 
such as ethylene diamine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flexible packaging 
printing inks formulated from a copolymer of polyethyleneglycol 
methacrylate and a polyamide resin, 
pigment, solvent and cellulose acetate butyrate. Flexible packaging printing inks are typically 
printed by rotary letterpress printing using flexible 
rubber plates or by gravure printing using engraved 
chrome-plated cylinders on a wide variety of substrates, 
e.g. plastic films such as cellulose acetate, 
polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyesters, 
polystyrene, cellophane, glassine, tissue, aluminum 
foils, liners, bags, paper labels, box coverings, gift 
wrappings, etc. Flexible packaging printing inks are widely used in 
the graphic arts industry. They offer economy, 
versatility, quality and simplicity and permit a roll of 
material to be multi-color printed in a continuous web at 
speeds of over 300 meters per minute and feed it directly 
to converting machines for slitting, forming or 
laminating. However, these inks must be carefully 
formulated so as to avoid the problems indigenous to 
these types of inks, e.g. chemical pinholing (failure of 
the ink to properly wet a plastic film surface), 
mechanical pinholing (the appearance of the pattern of 
the etched ink form roller), feathering (the appearance 
of stringy or ragged edges), mottle (ridged or speckled 
patterns), precipitation of part of the vehicle, blocking 
(a sticking or transfer of the image to the underside of 
the web), adhesion of the ink to the substrate, etc.  
 The inks of the present invention overcome the 
printing problems alluded to above because of the unique 
type of copolymer as well as the cellulose acetate 
butyrate employed in conjunction with the pigment and the 
solvent. Prior art inks containing resins such as 
shellac, nitrocellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose 
acetate propionate, conventional polyamide resins, 
acrylic and methacrylic resins, ketone resins, polyvinyl 
chloride, etc. have been found to be clearly 
disadvantageous in comparison to the inks of the present 
invention. The present invention relates to flexible packaging 
printing inks comprising: 
(a) a copolymer of polyethyleneglycol methacrylate 
and a polyamide resin prepared from the 
condensation of a dibasic acid mixture with a 
diamine mixture, said dibasic acid mixture 
comprising (i) about 0.5-0.8 equivalents of a 
C20-C44 dibasic acid mixture comprised of about 
60-100 % dimers, 0-40 % trimers and 0-5% 
monomers, and (ii) about 0.2-0.7 equivalents of 
at least one C6-C12 dibasic
