An electromechanical tool (1) for driving fasteners into a workpiece. 
The tool (1) uses a single flywheel (26) in combination with a clutch 

mechanism (32) 
whereby a conically shaped flywheel (26) frictionally cooperates with a 

corresponding drum (30) to cause a driver (38) which is coupled to the 
drum (30) by 

a cable (36) to be pulled with considerable force through a working 
stroke to drive a fastener from the tool (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to an
electromechanical fastener driving tool, and, in
particular, to a fastener driving tool which uses a
cone clutch to couple a flywheel to a fastener driving
device.Prior art workers have devised many types of
mechanically operated fastener driving tools utilizing
driving means actuated pneumatically,
electromechanically or by internal combustion. To
date, pneumatically actuated fastener driving tools
are the ones most frequently encountered. While
pneumatically actuated tools work well and have become
quite sophisticated, they nevertheless require the
presence of a compressor or the like.There are many job sites where a source of
compressed air is not normally present. This is
particularly true of smaller job sites and the like.
On the other hand, electricity is almost always
present on such sites. As a consequence, particularly
in recent years, prior art workers have directed
considerable attention to electromechanical tools.Some prior art electromechanical tools
depend upon a heavy duty solenoid to do the fastener
driving. In general, however, such tools are not 
adequate where large driving forces are required or
desired. As a consequence, prior art workers have
also expended considerable thought and effort in the
development of electromechanical fastener driving
tools employing one or more flywheels. Examples of
such tools are taught in US-A-4,042,036;
US-A-4,121,745; US-A-4,204,622; and US-A-4,298,072. Other
examples are taught in GB-A-2,000,716
and EP-A-546834. EP-A-546834 is a prior art document
within the meaning of Article 54(3) EPC. GB-A-2,000,716
and EP-A-546834 relate to an electromechanical fastener
driving tool which uses a single flywheel in
combination with the clutch mechanism, whereby the
rotational energy of the flywheel rotated by a prime
mover in the form of an electric motor is translated
through a suitable transferring means into linear
movement of the fastener driver which is shiftable
between a normal retracted position and an extended
fastener driving position.It will be evident from these patents that prior
art workers have devoted a great deal of time to the
development of flywheel fastener driving tools.
Nevertheless, such tools do present their own unique
problems. For example, in tools utilising two
flywheels, it has been the practice to provide a
separate electric motor for each flywheel. This adds
considerably to the weight and bulk of the tool and is
difficult to synchronise. Another approach is to
mount one of the flywheels on the
