<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device for causing a break in a hose, e.g. a hose at petrol stations, which is provided at one end with a pistol valve with an interlock for holding it open and, to prevent flow out of the break, which is located in a valve housing, with a valve cone and a valve seat interacting with the latter. In addition, the breaking location has a number of predetermined breaking points so that, under a given stress, a break is formed in such a way that the valve cone engages leaktightly on the valve seat.

<CLAIMS>
Device for causing a rupture point in or at a hose, for
instance a hose at filling stations, which can be equipped at

one end with a pistol valve with an interlock device to hold it
open and to prevent outflow from the rupture point, whereby the

rupture point is arranged in a valve chamber (1) with a valve
cone (2) and a valve seat (17) interacting with it, and the

rupture point exhibits a number of predetermined rupture points
(15, 16, 27), so that, in the presence of a given loading, a

rupture takes place of such a kind that the valve cone (2)
engages with the valve seat (17) in a sealing fashion, and

whereby the valve chamber (1) exhibits two parts (3, 4) capable
of sliding axially relative to one another and of being separated

from one another, between which a locking means (15) is
arranged that is so executed as to break at a given stress

loading, 
characterised in that
 a radial, material-reducing
predetermined rupture groove (16, 27) is arranged both in the

valve chamber (1) and in the valve cone (2) and, in fact, with
the parts in their normal operating position precisely at the

same level with one another, and in that the groove (16) in the
valve chamber (1) is arranged at the end of the area (5) that

permits the axial displacement.
Device in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the valve chamber (1) is arranged at the free end of the hose.
Device in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the locking means (15) consists of a pin that extends radially
between the parts (3, 4) that are capable of axial displacement

and is protected in the presence of the predetermined loading.
Device in accordance with Claim 3, 
characterised in that

the pin (15) is attached at the end of a stop screw.
Device in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the valve seat (17) lies in the fixed part (3) of the valve
chamber (1) in the hose, whereas the other part (4) of the valve 

chamber (1) lies outside the predetermined rupture point groove
(16).
Device in accordance with Claims 1 and/or 5, 
characterised
in that
 the valve cone (2) is spring-loaded against the valve
seat (17).
