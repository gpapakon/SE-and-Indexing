<ABSTRACT>
Incident light is photoelectrically converted in 
a one-unit pixel photoelectric converter section (300), while 

an electronic shuttering time two pixel mixture signal 
charge (301), a field signal charge 1 (302), and a field signal 

charge 2 (303), are transferred respectively with a 8-phase 
clock to HCCD1 (304), HCCD2 (305), and HCCD3 (306). After passing 

through a CDS 
&
 clamp circuit (307), they are subjected to a 
decision of signal saturation by a signal decision circuit 

(309). After having their outputs selected by a signal 
selector circuit (308), they are subjected to calculating 

processing in a signal processing circuit (310) to execute 
image signal reproduction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for driving a solid
state image pickup device for expanding the management range
of the quantity of incident light in the high-luminance side
and in particular
for expanding the management range
of the quantity of incident light for elevated luminances by
setting up at least two signal charging periods in a
specified period represented by the field or frame of a
video signal and reproducing the signal charges in the
signal charging period without using any external field
memory or any frame memory and a method for driving the
same.According to a conventional technique, at
least two mutually-different charging periods are set up in 
one frame or one field in expanding the management range in
quantity of incident light. For example, a first charging
period T1 corresponding to the conventional vertical
scanning period and a second charging period T2 shorter than
the first charging period in the vertical blanking period
are set up in one field period TF. Then a signal charge Q1
obtained in the first charging period is reproduced with a
gain of 1, and a signal charge Q2 obtained in the second
charging period is reproduced with a gain (T1/T2). In this
place, when the signal charge Q1 reaches a saturation charge
quantity, a management range in quantity of incident light
being (T1/T2) times greater than the gain in the
conventional case is consequently achieved by using the
signal information of the signal charge Q2.In regard to the above-mentioned element
drive method for expanding the management range in quantity
of incident light, there is a proposal of dispensing with
any external frame memory (Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Publication No. JP-A-63-250980). The above-mentioned
proposal describes a method for continuously transferring
signal charges obtained in two charging periods dividedly 
provided in one field period TF in a vertical CCD (VCCD) by producing three signal
packets with four pixels and a total of eight transfer electrodes according to the
structure of the current CCD, using signal charges of a mixture of two pixels in the first
charging period and two packets, and using signal charges of a mixture of four pixels
in the second charging period as one packet.From patent abstracts of Japan, volume 15, No. 383 (E-11 16) of September 27,
1991, & JP-A-3 153 176,
a solid state imaging apparatus is known including a solid state imager of an
interline charge transfer device type, including a plurality of photoelectric conversion
cells arranged in a matrix, and a
