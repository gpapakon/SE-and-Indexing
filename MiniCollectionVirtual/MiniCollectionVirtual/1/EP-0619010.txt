<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to kilns and, more particularly, to
rotary kilns having a polygonal refractory lining for pyro-processing cement, lime,
and other minerals.Conventional rotary kilns utilized for pyro-processing cement, lime,
and other minerals, are commonly lined with refractories or bricks that protect the
shells of rotary kilns against heat and abrasion. Generally, tapered bricks are placed
in a ring manner along the circumference of the steel shell of the kiln. In addition
to protecting the steel shell, the refractory bricks reduced the heat loss through the
steel shell.Unfortunately, conventional rotary kilns with present refractory lining
designs are still heat inefficient, resulting in a prohibitively high fuel cost. For
example, although the theoretical heat of formation of a Type I cement clinker is
420 kcal/kg, typical dry and wet process kilns consume far greater energy,
approximately 1110 kcal/kg (38% heat efficiency) and 1300 kcal/kg (32% heat
efficiency), respectively. Similarly, for lime kilns, typical heat efficiencies are in
the range of about 40%. Such low heat efficiencies result from high radiative loss,
in addition to heat loss resulting from surplus heat being dissipated in the stack
gases, and the processed product itself.German Patent Publication C 544200 describes a rotary kiln where a
polygonal cross section is provided for a short length of the kiln, the cross section
for the remainder of the kiln being circular. The short polygonal stretch is to
provide for increased tumbling of material being treated in the kiln prior its entering
a sintering zone.I have invented a kiln having improved heat efficiencies and which
overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art. In particular, the kiln of the present
invention affords a high heat efficiency and, moreover, does not deleteriously affect
the throughput of the kiln. The present invention relates to a kiln comprising a shell having a
inner wall and a lining disposed within and adjacent at least a portion of the inner
wall. The lining has a generally polygonal cross sectional configuration.
Accordingly, the present invention provides a kiln (100) for processing material said
kiln being rotatable about its longitudinal axis and being tilted from the horizontal
so that burden fed into the kiln at one end will progress through the kiln during
processing comprising a shell (120) having an inner wall and a lining (105) which
extends for the full length of the inner wall disposed within and adjacent said wall
characterized in

material (175) positioned between the wall and the brick lining.
The kiln of claim 6, further comprising a layer of a heat insulating
material positioned between the wall and the cast lining.
The kiln of any of the preceding claims, wherein one end of the shell
is positioned relative to the second end to cause the burden to move toward the
