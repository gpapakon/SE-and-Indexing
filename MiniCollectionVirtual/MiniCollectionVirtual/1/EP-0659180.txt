<ABSTRACT>
Novel derivatives of 1-deoxynojirimycin are disclosed which have thio or sulfinyl substituents at C-2 or C-3. They can be represented by formulae (I, II). These compounds are useful inhibitors of lentiviruses such as visna virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Methods of chemical synthesis of these derivatives and intermediates therefor are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel derivatives of 1,5-dideoxy-1,5-imino-D-glucitol 
having thio or sulfinyl 
substituents at C-2 and/or C-3, and, more particularly, 
to the chemical synthesis of these derivatives and 
intermediates therefor. These compounds are useful for 
inhibiting glycosidase enzymes and for inhibiting 
viruses such as lentiviruses. 1,5-dideoxy-1,5-imino-D-glucitol (deoxynojirimycin 
or DNJ) and its N-alkyl and O-acylated derivatives are 
known inhibitors of glycosidase enzymes and also 
inhibitors of viruses such as human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV). See, e.g., U.S. Patents 4,849,430; 
5,003,072; 5,030,638 and PCT Int'l. Appln. WO 87/03903. 
Several of these derivatives also are effective against 
other viruses such as HSV and CMV as disclosed in U.S. 
Patent 4,957,926. In some cases antiviral activity is 
enhanced by combination of the DNJ derivative with other 
antiviral agents such as AZT as described in U.S. Patent 
5,011,829. Various of these DNJ derivative compounds are 
antihyperglycemic agents based on their activity as 
glycosidase inhibitors. See, e.g., U.S. Patents 
4,182,763, 4,533,668 and 4,639,436. The 2-acetamide 
derivatives of DNJ also are reported to be potent 
glycosidase inhibitors by Fleet et al., Chem. Lett. 7, 
1051-1054 (1986); and Kiso et al. J. Carbohydr. Chem.10, 
25-45 (1991).  
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the search 
continues for the discovery and novel synthesis of new 
and improved antiviral compounds. In accordance with the present invention, novel 
derivatives of 1,5-dideoxy-1,5-imino-D-glucitol having 
thio or sulfinyl substituents at C-2 and/or C-3 are 
provided. These novel DNJ derivative compounds and 
various of their intermediates are useful inhibitors of 
glycosidase enzymes and also have useful antiviral 
activity as demonstrated against lentivirus. Compounds 
of this invention are also useful intermediates for the 
synthesis of antiviral compounds. According to another 
embodiment of the invention, novel methods of chemical 
synthesis of these compounds and their intermediates are 
provided. The novel C-2 and/or C-3 thio or sulfinyl 
substituted derivatives of 1,5-dideoxy-1,5-imino-D-glucitol 
can be represented by the following general 
structural Formulas I and II. The compounds of Formula I are in the gluco 
stereochemical configuration whereas those of Formula II 
are in the altro stereochemical configuration. 
In Formulas I and II, R1 is a C1-C6 alkyl group,or phenyl;  
 
R3 is H or a C1-C8 branched or unbranched alkyl group; and 
R5
