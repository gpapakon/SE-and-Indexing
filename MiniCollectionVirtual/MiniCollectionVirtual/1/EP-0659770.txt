<ABSTRACT>
A molding of an ABS-based resin has rubber 
particles located at a depth of 0.5-1.5 µm from a 

surface of the molding, and the particles 
morphologically comprise at least the following two 

types of particles: 

(1) A particles having an a/b ratio not greater 
than 1.5, wherein a and b represent a major 

axis and a minor axis, respectively, and 
(2) B particles having an a/b ratio not smaller 
than 5, wherein a and b have the same 

meanings as defined above. 
When a section taken by a microtome in parallel with a 
surface of the molding is observed in an electron 

micrograph, and assuming that the total area of the 
rubber particles as observed in the electron micrograph 

is 100%, the total area of the A particles accounts for 
at least 10% and that of the B particles is in a range 

of 0.01-90%.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
based resin and
an injection molding of an ABS-based
resin, said molding having a particular morphology.This invention also pertains to the provision of
the following moldings made of an ABS-based resin and
having the respective quality:
(A) an ABS-based resin molding with a surface
having small unevenness in gloss and a high gloss;(B) an ABS-based resin molding having small unevenness
in falling weight impact strength,(C) an ABS-based resin molding having a surface
of an excellent delustered appearance and small unevenness 
in delustering and equipped with high impact
strength, and(D) an ABS-base resin molding having a surface of
a uniform gloss characteristic (high gloss or
delustered appearance) and of small position-dependent
unevenness and equipped with high impact strength.ABS-based resin moldings have been employed widely
as moldings for engineering and like applications,
such as parts or components for electric appliances,
electronic equipments, automotive vehicles and the
like, for their excellent mechanical strength, heat
resistance, chemical resistance, anti-torque strength
upon tightening a screw, color tone, surface appearance
and the like.ABS resin is required to be available as polymers
with properties varied to meet application purposes.
Polymers even with totally opposite properties may be
needed, for example, to provide moldings ranging from
those having a high gloss to those delustered. It is
also required to achieve various and stringent
properties to assure, for example, high impact strength
and prevention of position-dependent unevenness in
gloss, delustered appearance and impact strength of
moldings. To achieve these, it is generally necessary to
control physical properties by choosing or adjusting
rather complex conditions such as the kind of a rubber
component to be graft polymerized, its particle size
and conditions for the graft polymerization. Under the
current circumstances, however, it is still difficult
to achieve high physical properties even if such conditions
are chosen or adjusted as appropriately as possible.These moldings are accompanied by various quality
problems, because in the course of production of the
moldings, it is difficult to mold and/or process the
whole moldings under uniform conditions. Described
specifically, the following problems can be mentioned:
(1) The gloss is insufficient or the surface of a
molding is not uniform. With respect to the gloss
characteristic, in particular, the gloss of a molding
may vary depending on the
