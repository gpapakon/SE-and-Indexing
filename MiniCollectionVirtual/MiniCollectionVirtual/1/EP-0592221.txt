<ABSTRACT>
The interconnections (24, 26, 28) for 
transmitting print commands from a printer (12) to a 

printhead (14) are reduced by the use of on-printhead 
circuitry (16, 30). In a basic embodiment, the 

printhead driver circuitry (16) includes a matrix of 
drivers (31) controlled by gates, power and control 

interconnections. Interconnections are reduced by 
enabling rows and columns of drivers witn the power and 

control interconnections. A multiplexer (70) may also 
be added to further reduce control interconnections. 

In an advanced embodiment, the printhead driver 
circuitry (30) includes a register (40) for converting 

a serial stream of print enable signals from the 
printer (12) into format for applying such signals 

concurrently to switching devices (46) for one or more 
heater resistors (44). An address generator (34) on 

the printhead (14) generates address signals in 
response to an address generating signal from the 

printer (12). The printer (12) provides constant power 
to the printhead (14) so that energizing of the heater 

resistors (44) is a function of the address and print 
enable signals and not of the power. Variations on
 the 
basic and advanced embodiments are also shown and 

described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to thermal
inkjet printing. More particularly, this invention
relates to a novel printhead design for increasing the
number of inkjet nozzles on the printhead while minimizing
the number of electrical interconnections between the
printer and printhead. The term "printhead" as used
herein includes an ink source as well as an ink drop
generating mechanism attached to the source and is also
known as a cartridge or pen.Print quality and throughput are important
objectives in the design of thermal inkjet printers.
Print quality is a function of, among other things, the
distance between the inkjet nozzles on the printhead.
Higher print quality produces crisper output and more
colors through better dithering. Throughput is a function
of the width of the printed swath. The wider the swath,
the fewer passes the printhead must make to print a page.Both of these objectives can be met by increasing
the number of inkjet nozzles on the printhead. By placing
nozzles closer together, the print quality can be
improved. By placing more nozzles on the printhead, the
width of the printing swath is increased. However, adding
nozzles requires adding associated drivers, which comprise
heater resistors, control logic and power and control
interconnections. These interconnections are flexible
wires or equivalent conductors that electrically connect
the drivers on the printhead to printhead interface
circuitry in the printer. They may be contained in a
ribbon cable that connects on one end to control circuitry
within the printer and on the other end to driver
circuitry on the printhead.Interconnections are a major source of cost in
printer design, and adding them to increase the number of
drivers increases the cost. Interconnections also affect
the reliability of the printer, with more interconnections
increasing the likelihood that the printer will fail. 
Thus as the number of drivers on a printhead has increased
over the years, there have been attempts to reduce the
number of interconnections per driver. One approach that
is presently being investigated is called "integrated
drive head" or IDH multiplexing. In IDH, the drivers are
split into groups known as primitives. Each primitive has
its own power supply interconnection ("primitive select")
and return interconnection ("primitive return"). In
addition, a number of control lines are used to enable
particular drivers. These control or address lines are
shared among all primitives. This approach can be thought
of as an XY matrix where X is the
