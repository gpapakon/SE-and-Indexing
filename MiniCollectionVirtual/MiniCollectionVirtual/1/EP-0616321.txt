<ABSTRACT>
The present invention aims at overcoming the problem of rusting 
relating to a magnetic recording medium composed of a non-magnetic 

base and a magnetic recording layer of a ferromagnetic metal layer 
formed thereon. 
The problems are overcome by a magnetic recording medium according 
to the present invention which comprises a non-magnetic support, a 

ferromagnetic metal thin film as a magnetic recording layer and a 
lubricating layer, characterized in that the lubricating layer 

contains a mixture of a first lubricant having a polar perfluoro 
radial and a second lubricant expressed by the following formula:

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic recording medium
composed of a non-magnetic support having a ferromagnetic metal thin
film thereon and, more particularly relates to such a magnetic
recording medium having a lubricating layer on the ferromagnetic
metal thin film.Techniques relating to a magnetic recording medium having a
ferromagnetic metal thin film as a magnetic recording layer such as
Co-Ni, Co-Cr or other materials have been commercially utilized and
extensively studied in the art for video recording, digital recording
or other high density recording, or for making recording and
reproducing devices compact and/or for a high performance.In a magnetic recording medium which uses a ferromagnetic metal
thin film as a magnetic recording layer, the metal thin film is
usually directly contacted with a magnetic head and accordingly
is relatively easily worn and gradually results in a poor running
property. To overcome this problem, provision of a lubricating layer
was proposed by Japanese Patent Application Kokoku Nos.4-30084 and
Japanese Patent Application Kokai Nos.56-87236 and 5-12656. However,
it is revealed that the lubricating layers proposed by these
publications are not sufficient from the standpoint of anti-rust 
property and still reproduction property. Particularly, lubricants disclosed in
Kokoku No.4-30084 and Kokai Nos.56-87236 were proved totally ineffective
with respect to the anti-rust property and that disclosed in Kokai No 5-12656 is
too repellent to apply on the ferromagnetic metal thin film.The problem to be solved by the invention as mentioned above, as
ferromagnetic metal layers lack a sufficient lubricating property, it has been a
practice to apply a lubricant on the surface of the ferromagnetic metal layers
and accordingly a good lubricating property can be obtained. However, the prior
art lubricating layer is not sufficient from the aspect of anti-rust property as
well as anti-wear running property such as still reproduction property.Accordingly, a principal object of the present invention is to overcome
the problem of rusting relating to a magnetic recording medium composed of a
non-magnetic base and a magnetic recording layer consisting essentially of a
ferromagnetic metal layer formed thereon. In addition, the present invention is
to provide a magnetic recording medium having a good running property and a
long still time.The problems are overcome according to the invention by a magnetic
recording medium comprising a non-magnetic support, a magnetic recording
layer of
