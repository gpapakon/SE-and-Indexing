<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a fitting-free pipe closure (1, 2) for the spin welding of pipelines, preferably consisting of the same polymers, and a recyclable pipeline system containing the pipe closure (1, 2) and pipelines, as well as the process for producing this non-permeable connection of closure parts and pipelines.

Polymer pipe connector comprising a core part
(1) and a sleeve part (2) for liquid lines, which can

be used for spin welding with polymer lines, in
particular for connecting pipelines made of the same

polymer such that they are sealed against permeation,
characterized in that each of the two pipe connector

parts (1, 2) has a cylindrical connection region (7, 8)
for spin welding, which is provided at least partially

with a cross-sectional constriction (9, 10) and with an
annular groove (11, 12) for receiving molten polymer

material or material from flash which has been
produced.
Pipe connector according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the polymer is selected from the group

comprising homopolyamides, copolyamides and polyamide
blends with thermoplastic polymers, nylon-6, nylon-66,

nylon-11 and nylon-12 being preferred.
Pipe connector according to Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the polymer contains conductive

additives, preferably conductive carbon black.
Pipe connector according to Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the polymer contains reinforcing

fillers from the group comprising glass fibres, carbon
fibres, polymeric reinforcing fibres, whiskers and mineral

fibres.
Recyclable spin-welded line system comprising a

pipe connector according to Claims 1 to 4 and pipelines
made of the same polymer, in particular of polyamides

from the group comprising homopolyamides, copolyamides
and polyamide blends with thermoplastic polymers, 

nylon-6, nylon-66, nylon-11 and nylon-12 being
preferred as polyamides.
Spin-welded line system according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the polymer of the pipe connector

and of the pipelines contains the same additives, preferably
conductive carbon blacks.
Spin-welded line system according to Claim 5 or
6, characterized in that only the polymer of the pipe

connector contains reinforcing fillers.
Method of producing connections sealed against
permeation between pipe connector parts of a pipe

connector according to Claims 1 to 4 and pipelines, in
particular made of the same polymer, by spin welding.
Recyclable permeation-sealed line systems
made of polymers, in particular of polyamides, produced

by the method according to Claim 8.
