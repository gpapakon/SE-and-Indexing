<ABSTRACT>
In a process for manufacturing 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid 
by means of oxidizing 5-acyloxy-m-xylene or its oxidation 

intermediate with molecular oxygen in a solvent consisting of 
lower aliphatic carboxylic acid and acetic anhydride in the 

presence of catalyst consisting of heavy metal comprising 
cobalt as the main component, and a bromine compound, and 

hydrolyzing the product thereby obtained, an improvement which 
is characterized in that the oxidation is carried out under 

pressure of 2-15 kg/cmÂ²gauge in the presence of an alkali metal 

compound amounting to 0.1-1.1 gram atom in terms of alkali 
metal atom as against 1 gram atom of the heavy metal used for 

the catalyst. 
By the present invention there can be obtained high-quality 
5-hydroxyisophthalic acid having excellent color from 

5-acyloxy-m-xylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvement of a process for
manufacturing 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid ( hereinafter
referred to as merely "5-HIPA"), which is useful as a raw
material for high-performance polymers, pharmaceuticals and
agrochemicals.It is well known that 5-HIPA can be produced by alkali
fusion of 5-sulfoisophthalic acid. Nevertheless, the said
method poses major technical problems such that large amounts
of fuming sulfuric acid or alkaline material such as caustic
soda have to be used, that the sulfonation reaction affords
only poor selectivity, that large amounts of by-products are
produced in the alkali fusion step, and that the reaction is
required to proceed at high temperature as well as under
high pressure, thus rendering it quite difficult indeed to
inexpensively produce high-purity 5-HIPA in a large quantity.It is also public knowledge that 5-HIPA can be produced by
oxidizing 5-acyloxy-m-xylene with molecular oxygen in the
presence of lower aliphatic carboxylic acid and acetic
anhydride, using a cobalt compound and a bromine compound, or
a cobalt compound, a manganese compound and a bromine
compound (Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho-57
(1982)-15737.) Since the above-mentioned method is, however,
an oxidation reaction carried out under an elevated pressure
of 20-50 kg /cm2 gauge, using either oxygen or air, the
5-acyloxy-isophthalic acid thus produced exhibited only a
poor color. That is to say, the said product posed such 
problem that it is discolored into yellowish brown or grey,
while the method itself gave only an insufficient yield.
Even if such discolored 5-acyloxyisophthalic acid is
hydrolyzed, there cannot be obtained 5-HIPA that can be
utilized as the raw material for high performance polymers,
pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals.The present inventors have arrived at the present invention
by means which resolve the above-mentioned
problems, after having made intensive studies on how to
resolve such problems.In fact, the present inventors have discovered that the above-mentioned
problem can be resolved by oxidizing with air
5-acyloxy-m-xylene at a pressure of 2-15 kg /cm2 gauge
which is lower than the conventionally adopted pressure
level in the presence of lower aliphatic carboxylic acid and
acetic anhydride, with a catalyst system consisting of a
cobalt compound and a bromine compound, while letting a
specific amount of alkali metal compound coexist with the
reaction system.Hence, the object of the present invention is to provide a
method for producing at a high yield
