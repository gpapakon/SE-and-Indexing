Control system (10) for changing the ratio of an 
automatic transmission (3), having means (9) of acquiring 

input variables which are derived from a driver-vehicle 
system, means of generating match functions (fuzzy sets) 

for the input variables and means of changing the gear 
ratios, the means (9) of acquiring the input variables

means of changing the gear ratios cooperating in such a 

way that in accordance with fuzzy production rules output 
variables are established, by means of which a gear ratio 

is determined, characterized in that the totality of 
fuzzy production rules is subdivided into the following

a) a basic set of fuzzy production rules for shift 
point determination, which defines a consumption-oriented 

driving mode, 
b) an adaptation set of fuzzy production rules for 
modifying the basic set of rules in dependence upon 

an actual driving mode ranging from a consumption-oriented 
driving mode to a performance-oriented 

driving mode, 
c) an identification set of fuzzy production rules for 
identifying a driver by his driving mode, which 

ranges from a consumption-oriented driving mode to a 
performance-oriented driving mode. 
System according to claim 1, characterized by a 
supplementary adaptation set of fuzzy production rules 

for modifying the basic set of rules in dependence upon 
an actual driving state. 
System according to claim , characterized in that the 
input variables used to identify the driver are reduced 

by a filter (15) to output variables in the form of 
averaged features which allow recognition of the driving 

mode.  
 
System according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
input variables used to recognize the driving state are 

reduced by a filter (15) to output variables in the form 
of averaged features which allow recognition of the

System according to claims 3 or 4, characterized in that 
the output variables are generated by filtering according 

to fuzzy production rules. 
System according to claims 3 and 5, characterized in that 
the filter (15) in accordance with fuzzy production rules 

assigns to input variables of differing significance 
rating increments (PB, NB, ZO) which are added up into 

rating numbers which form the output variables. 
System according to claim 6, characterized in that the

integrator. 
System according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
gradients in the event of rising or falling input 

variables are weighted differently by asymmetric 
assignment of rating increments. 
System according to claims 1 and 2 as well as 4 or 5, 
characterized in that a distinction is made between the 

driving states: town, country road and motorway and in 
areas where the assignment to one of said driving states 

is uncertain, particularly during stop-go operation, the 
driving state: country road is systematically selected. 
System according to claim 1, characterized in that at 
least one match function of the basic set of rules is 

displaced by a parallel shift in ordinate direction in 
dependence upon the output variables of the adaptation
