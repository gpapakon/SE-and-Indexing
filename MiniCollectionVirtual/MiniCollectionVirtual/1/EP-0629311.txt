<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the mechanical properties of a coil (1), a first electroconductive winding (39) of the coil (1) is designed as a coil former with a first connecting element (15) to which is secured a second connecting element (17) by means of an insulating part (25). Both connecting elements (15, 17) constitute the connections for the coil (1). A self-supporting coil structure is thus obtained. This coil (1) is particularly suitable as an undervoltage winding with a low number of windings for cast-resin dry-type transformers.

Coil (1), in particular for a high current 
transformer, where a first electroconductive turn (3) 

has a first connection element (15), to which a second 
connection element (17) is fastened by way of an 

insulating part (25), which second connection element 
(17) is electrically connected to a second 

electroconductive turn (18) which is arranged so as to 
be insulated with respect to the first turn (3), 

characterized in that the first turn (3) is constructed 
as a cylindrical coil body with an axial slot (5), into 

which an insulating piece (7) is inserted, with the 
second and perhaps additional turns (11 and 18) being 

supported so as to be insulated from the first turn 
(3). 
Coil according to claim 1, with the connection 
elements (15, 17) being arranged at the ends of the 

turns (18, 3). 
Coil according to claim 2, with the turns (3, 
11, 18) being arranged between the two connection 

elements (15, 17). 
Coil according to one of claims 1 or 3, with 
the turns (11, 18) being wound from a strip conductor. 
Coil according to one of claims 1 to 4, with 
the connection elements (15, 17) serving as support 

elements. 
Coil according to one of claims 1 to 5, with 
concentrically arranged turns (11) being separated from 

each other by cooling channels formed by spacers. 
Coil according to one of claims 1 to 6, with 
the turns (3, 11, 18) being parts of a common turn. 
Coil according to one of claims 1 to 7, with 
windings formed by the turns (3, 11, 18) serving as 

transformer windings. 
Coil according to one of claims 1 to 8, with 
the insulating piece (7) mechanically connecting to  

 
each other in an electrically insulated manner the two 

points of the first turn (3), which are adjacent to 
each other at the axial slot (5), in the sense of 

forming a coil body. 
Coil according to claim 9, whereby to attain 
a favourable conductor guide on its side facing the 

additional outer turns (11) the insulating piece (7) 
closes level with the first turn (3). 
Coil according to claim 9 or 10, with the 
insulating piece (7) and the axial slot (5) being 

geared to match each other or being formed like a 
groove and tongue connection.
