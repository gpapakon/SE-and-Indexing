<ABSTRACT>
A recombinant combination strain which is capable of over-expressing at least two different genes under two separate promoters in filamentous fungi. The genes encode phytase and pH 2.5 acid phosphatase. GA- and GAPDH-promoters are preferably used. Mixtures containing desired ratios of the two enzymes are prepared by recombinant DNA techniques. The enzyme mixture shows a cooperative effect in the degradation of phytic acid and its salts. Preferred ratios of the two enzymes are about 3:1 to about 16:1. The DNA sequences were isolated from a wild-type (Aspergillus niger) ALKO243 (ATCC#38854).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 07/925,401
filed July 31, 1992.This invention is related to strains of filamentous fungi capable of over-expressing at
least two phytate degrading enzymes in desired ratios. Also disclosed are DNA sequences,
promoters, DNA constructs and vectors useful for the preparation of such strains.Minerals are essential elements for the growth of all organisms. For livestock
production of monogastric animals (e.g., pigs, poultry) and fish, feed is commonly
supplemented with minerals. Plant seeds are a rich source of minerals since they contain ions
that are complexed with the phosphate groups of phytic acid. Ruminants do not require
inorganic phosphate and minerals because microorganisms in the rumen produce enzymes that
catalyze conversion of phytate (myo-inositol-hexaphosphate) to inositol and inorganic
phosphate. In the process minerals that have been complexed with phytate are released.Phytate occurs as a source of stored phosphorus in virtually all plant feeds (for a
review see: Phytic Acid, Chemistry and Applications, E. Graf (Ed.), Pilatus Press:
Minneapolis, MN, U.S.A., 1986). Phytic acid forms a normal part of the seed in cereals and
legumes. It functions to bind dietary minerals that are essential to the new plant as it emerges
from the seed. When the phosphate groups of phytic acid are removed by the seed enzyme
phytase, the ability to bind metal ions is lost and the minerals become available to the plant. In
livestock feed grains, the trace minerals bound by phytic acid are only partially available for
absorption by monogastric animals, which lack phytase activity. Although some hydrolysis of
phytate occurs in the colon, most phytate passes through the gastrointestinal tract of
monogastric animals and is excreted in the manure contributing to fecal phosphate pollution 
problems in areas of intense livestock production. Inorganic phosphorus released in the colon
has no nutritional value to livestock because inorganic phosphorus is absorbed only in the
small intestine. Thus, a significant amount of the nutritionally important dietary minerals are
potentially not available to monogastric animals.Conversion of phytate to inositol and inorganic phosphorus can be catalyzed by
microbial enzymes referred to broadly as phytases. Phytases such as the phytase #EC 3.1.3.8
are capable of catalyzing hydrolysis of myo-Inositol hexaphosphate to D-myo-inositol
1,2,4,5,6-pentaphosphate and orthophosphate. Certain fungal phytases reportedly
