<ABSTRACT>
When the pump pressure detected through a pressure 
detecting line (48) is raised higher than a first predetermined 

pressure Pd1, a recovery switching valve (44) is shifted 
to a valve-closed position to cease the recovery function. 

At this time, the pump delivery pressure detected 
through a pressure detecting line (51) is higher than a 

second predetermined pressure Pd1* close to the first 
predetermined pressure Pd1, and an engine speed increasing 

device (52) controls an engine controller (11) to increase the 
rotational speed of an engine (10), thereby increasing the 

pump delivery rate. Thus, it is possible to make small 
speed change of an actuator and to increase working efficiency 

with no deterioration in operability, even when a 
recov
ery function is ceased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic control 
system mounted on construction machines such as hydraulic 
excavators and cranes, and more particularly to a hydraulic 
control system equipped with a recovery circuit for recovering 
a return fluid from a hydraulic actuator to the 
supply side when the pressure of a hydraulic fluid supplied 
to the actuator is small. One of prior art hydraulic control systems equipped 
with recovery circuits is disclosed in JP, B, 4-59484, for 
example. This known hydraulic control system comprises a 
hydraulic pump, a hydraulic actuator, e.g., a hydraulic 
cylinder, driven by a hydraulic fluid delivered from the 
hydraulic pump, a directional control valve for controlling 
a flow of the hydraulic fluid supplied from the hydraulic 
pump to the hydraulic cylinder, and a recovery circuit for 
recovering a return fluid from the hydraulic cylinder to 
the supply side of the hydraulic cylinder when the pressure 
of the hydraulic fluid supplied to the hydraulic cylinder 
is small. The recovery circuit comprises a recovery passage 
communicating between a drain passage and a supply passage 
in the directional control valve, a check valve provided in  
 
the recovery passage for allowing the hydraulic fluid to 
flow only in a direction from the drain passage to the 
supply passage, a recovery switching valve provided in the 
drain passage in the directional control valve, a pressure 
detecting passage for detecting a pressure in the supply 
passage in the directional control valve and transmitting 
the detected pressure to the recovery switching valve, and 
a pressure signal generator provided outside the directional 
control valve for generating a set pressure Pc for the 
recovery switching valve. When the directional control valve is operated in a 
direction to extend the hydraulic cylinder, the hydraulic 
fluid delivered from the hydraulic pump flows through the 
supply passage in the directional control valve and then 
enters a bottom-side chamber of the hydraulic cylinder. 
The hydraulic fluid flowing out of a rod-side chamber of 
the hydraulic fluid is returned to a reservoir through the 
drain passage in the directional control valve. In addition, 
the pressure in the supply passage in the directional 
control valve is detected through the pressure detecting 
passage. When the detected pressure is lower than the set 
pressure Pc from the pressure signal generator, the drain 
passage is closed by the recovery switching valve in the 
directional control valve to effect
