<ABSTRACT>
A knee brace (23) has a rigid posterior strut (25) behind the knee joint (1) in the popliteal area (29) with terminal portions (31, 33) adjacent, but spaced from the lateral and medial sides of the knee. A prophylactic embodiment of the invention has a lateral inferior rigid support member (35) pivoted on the lateral terminal portion (31) of the strut (25) and secured to the leg (13), and a medial superior rigid support member (39) pivoted on the medial terminal portion (33) of the strut and secured to the thigh (7). Stiff anterior, generally triangular, cuff members (55, 57) each have one edge (59) secured to one of the rigid support members (35, 39) and an opposite vertex (61) detachably, pivotally secured to the opposite terminal portion (31, 33) of the strut.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an orthopedic support
device, specifically a rear strut stabilized, derotational
brace which may be used for prophylactic, functional
and rehabilitative applications, particularly for a knee joint.Generally knee braces may be classified according
to the function they perform. Prophylactic knee braces are
used to reduce the likelihood of injury during activities,
particularly sports, in which high loads are placed on the
knee joint. Usually, an objective of prophylactic knee
braces is to provide some support for the joint without
unduly restricting movement, thus reducing the risk of
injury to a normal knee joint. Functional knee braces are
used to support and stabilize injured joints, and hence,
provide the strongest reinforcement for the knee. They
often prohibit certain movements. Rehabilitative knee
braces are used to support previously injured joints and are
used extensively during post operative and rehabilitation
periods. Their designs generally lie between prophylactic
and functional braces in the amount of support they provide,
and the degree of restriction they impose on joint movement
is usually adjustable to provide only a specific range of
desired motion. From US-A-3 026 869 there is already known a brace comprising first and
second rigid support members. From FR-A-2 581 859 there is known a stiff
anterior cuff member secured to a rigid support member of a brace. From GB-A-2
215 213 there are known braces having first and second rigid support members
and first and second anchoring means as well as a rigid posterior strut.
However, there is no adjustability when the strut is attached to the terminal
portions. Furthermore, from US-A-4,088,130 there is known a rigid steel member
along the thigh and one along the leg. Finally, from FR-A-2 486 388 there
are known rigid members, but these members are not on opposite sides
right/left. Prophylactic supports for the knee joint include
wraps of adhesive or elastic tape and reinforced neoprene
sleeves. These devices, however, do not provide the support
generally required. Prophylactic knee braces have been
designed as single hinged vertical members placed laterally
on one side of the leg and held by cuffs and straps to the
thigh and the leg. Since the anatomy in the knee region is
naturally offset, the fixation on one side cannot support
the brace effectively. These braces tend to slip, thus
exerting undue forces acting against the natural kinematics
on the knee joint, and also concentrate forces laterally on
the knee, which

<CLAIMS>
A brace (23) for a knee joint (1) joining thigh (7) and leg (13) limb
members, said brace comprising:


first and second rigid support members (39, 35) extending only on one
side of the thigh and one side of the leg respectively, one of the sides being medial and

the other side being lateral;
first anchoring means (45) securing said first rigid support member (39)
to the thigh (7) along a fleshy portion of said one side of the thigh with a lower end

of said first rigid support member adjacent to but spaced from a first side of the knee

joint;
second anchoring means (43) securing said second rigid support member
(35) to the leg (13) along a fleshy portion of said one side of the leg with an upper end

of said second rigid support member adjacent to but spaced from a second side of the
knee joint; and 
a rigid posterior strut (25) having a first terminal portion (33) pivotally
connected at a first pivot point (41) to said lower end of said first rigid support

member (39) and inwardly spaced from the first side of the knee joint (1), a second
terminal portion (31) pivotally connected at a second pivot point (37) to said upper end

of said second rigid support member (35) and outwardly spaced from the second side
of the bee joint (1), and a rigid arcuate section (27) extending between said terminal

portions through a popliteal space (29) behind the knee joint, said rigid posterior strut
(25) being clamped between the thigh and leg to position said first and second pivot

points upon flexion of the knee joint.
The brace of Claim 1 including:

a first stiff anterior cuff member (57) secured to said first rigid support
member (39) and extending around in front of the thigh (7) and pivotally connected to

said second terminal portion (31) of said rigid posterior strut (25); and
a second stiff anterior cuff member (55) secured to said second rigid
support member (35) and extending around in front of the leg (13) and pivotally

connected to said first terminal portion (33) of said rigid posterior strut (25).
The knee brace of claim 2 wherein said first and second stiff anterior
cuff members (57, 55) are each generally triangular members having a side edge (59)

and a vertex (61) opposite the side edge, the side edge (59) of said first stiff cuff
member (57) being secured along said first rigid support member (39) and the vertex

of the first stiff cuff member pivotally connected to said second terminal portion (31)
of said rigid posterior strut (25) at a connection point (63) laterally aligned with the

first pivot point (41) on said first terminal portion (33) of said rigid posterior strut (25)
and the side edge (59) of said second stiff cuff member (55) being secured along said

second rigid support member (31) and the vertex (61) of the second stiff cuff member

securing means (189, 191) fixedly securing said elongated members in selectable axial
and rotational positions relative to said first and second ends respectively of said
