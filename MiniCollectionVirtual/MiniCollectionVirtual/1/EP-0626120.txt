<ABSTRACT>
A video signal is averaged with, selectively, the same signal advanced or retarded by one field interval. The choice of the advance or retarded signal is made so as always to constrain the averaging process to a single video frame. A noise reduction technique is therefore provided which can be cascaded many times without further degradation of the signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to video signal processing.It is an object of this invention to reduce noise levels in video signals and to
suppress luminance-to-chrominance cross-talk in decoded video signals.A variety of filter and other processing techniques have been proposed for noise
reduction purposes. Typically, these involve an averaging of the information at one pixel
with that from surrounding pixels in one, two or three dimensions. A compromise is
usually made between adequate noise reduction and a loss of resolution which is within
acceptable limits. A further difficulty arises when there is multi-generation processing of
a video signal. If a video signal is filtered repeatedly, using the same or different noise
reduction filters, there is a serious risk that the loss of resolution and any artifacts
introduced by the filtering process, will increase with each filtering pass.It is a specific object of this invention to provide for a method of video signal
processing which reduces noise in such a manner that a second or further filtering
operation upon the same video signal introduces no further degradation.Accordingly, the present invention consists, in one aspect, in a method of
continuous video signal processing, in which adjacent video fields in a succession of
video fields are averaged, wherein the current field is averaged alternately with the
preceding field and with the succeeding field, in such manner that averaging is conducted
only between fields belonging to the same video frame.It will be recognised that it is standard practice in video post production to ensure
frame integrity. By averaging only within a video frame, the present invention thus
avoids the spread of any loss of reduction or artifact.It is further important to recognise that the method according to the present
invention is applicable to video material from various sources, including original video
material and telecined film material. In a preferred form of the present invention, the averaging is disabled
at high inter-field luminance differences. The assumption is made that high
inter-field differences are less likely to have arisen from random noise.Suitably, the averaging is restricted to high frequency luminance signal
components.In another form, the present invention consists in video signal
processing means comprising a field delay line for generating a first video
signal, a second video signal advanced with respect to the first video signal
by one field interval and a third video signal retarded with respect to the
