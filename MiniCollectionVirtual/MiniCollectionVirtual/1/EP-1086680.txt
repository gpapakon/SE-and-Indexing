<ABSTRACT>
A polypositionable support applicable as clinical use
stretcher, consisting of a tabular body (6) fitted with

an integral polyurethane foam covering on its sharp cants,
stringers constituting two conventional folding devices

being articulated at the upper tabular body (6), these
folding devices being mobilized by means of pneumatic cylinders

(3) and (3'), being articulated at the lower zone
by means their fixing to the stringers, having horizontal

sliders (4) and driving pedals of the pneumatic pistons.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification relates to an application
for a Model of Utility, referring to a polypositionable
support applicable as clinical use stretcher, the evident
utility of which is to be configured as a mechanical
assembly, aided by pneumatic pistons, capable of placing
a support applicable as a stretcher in a determined
height, acting on driving pedals and the assembly
presenting adequate shelters and protections in order
to avoid accidents derived from the insertion, on the
part of users of the invention, of limbs into its movable
parts.This invention will find application in the industry
dedicated to the manufacture of elements, devices and
systems applicable to the public health; in a most concrete
way, in the industry dedicated to the manufacture
of stretcher-tables.It is known the existence of a plurality of stretcher-tables
in which the horizontal surface can be placed at
a determinated height by the actuation of certain mechanical
devices.Specifically, stretcher tables are known in which the 
the lifting is performed by means of a worm gear which,
manually or mechanically operated, meshes with a slider
associated with a folding device, lifting said horizontal
surface.Also, the applicant is aware of the existence of -
stretcher-tables in which a folding device supporting
the horizontal surface is driven by means of hydraulic
or pneumatic pistons, horizontally arranged, and the driving
of which on the lower part of the folding device
stringers, or on its related crosspieces, generates a lifting
or descending motion of said horizontal surface.The folding device is constituted starting from two
parallel folding sets formed by two stringers centrally
articulated, one of their lower ends being securely fixed
to the infradjacent surface, while the other end
can freely slide on same.The upper ends of the two stringers and their symmetrical
ones are articulated at the horizontal surface where
the patients rest, this surface being capable of being
lifted or descended by means of the linear displacement
of the lower free end of the folding device through a
mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic actuator.The above arrangement, wherein the hydraulic or pneumatic
actuators are horizontally located, operating between
the lower ends of the folding devices, presents some
operating deficiencies derived from their position with
regard the folding device, it being desirable their possible
elimination by means of a new arrangement or the
incorporation of accessory elements.The applicant is not aware of theexistence
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A polypositionable support applicable as clinical
use stretcher, constituted starting from a upper tabular

body (6) where the mobilization elements thereof are located
at the horizontal plane defined by it, characterized

in that it presents an integral polyurethane foam covering

on its sharp cants, and having stringers (1), (2),
(1') and (2') articulated, constituting two folding devices

of conventional type, driven by means of pneumatic
cylinders (3) and (3'), articulated, at their lower part,

at the proximities of the lower stationary end of the
stringers (1) and (1'), presenting also an articulation

of its upper end at the upper half of stringers (2) and
(2'), the lower end of which can freely slides over horizontal

sliders (4), where driving pedals (5) of the
pneumatic pistons (3) and (3') are situated.
A polypositionable support applicable as clinical
use stretcher, according to claim 1, characterized in

that it incorporates vertical gas actuators or shock
absorbers, having driving pedals located at the two major

sides of the support applicable as a table.
A polypositionable support applicable as clinical
use stretcher, according to claims 1 and 2, characterized

in that the board of the support applicable as a
stretcher is totally flat at its lower part, having a

perimetric screen along the board.
