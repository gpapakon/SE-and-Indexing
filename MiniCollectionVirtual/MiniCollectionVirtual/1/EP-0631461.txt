<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic 
circuit device comprising a printed wiring board and 
leadless components which are mounted on and connected 
to the printed wiring board by conductive bumps. In recent years electronic technology has advanced 
fast. It has made it possible to miniaturize electronic 
equipments, to utilize electronic components and 
semiconductor elements in the form of chips, and to 
provide wiring patterns having high line-density for use 
in these electronic equipments. It is increasingly 
demanded that electronic components and semiconductor 
elements be mounted on a printed wiring board in high 
density. In surface mount technology, now employed most 
widely, use is made of two-terminal leadless components 
called "chip components," such as passive-element components 
(e.g., resistors and capacitors). Chip components 
are mounted on a printed wiring board, with 
their terminal electrodes connected by a fillet-shaped 
solder to the pads provided on the printed wiring board. 
Generally, the reflow soldering method, wherein 
soldering paste is applied, is employed to mount chip 
components on a printed wiring board by using a fillet-shaped 
solder. The reflow soldering method is classified into 
hot-air reflow, infrared-ray reflow and vapor-phase  
 
soldering. Any of these reflow soldering methods 
comprises three steps. In the first step, solder paste 
is print-coated on the pads provided on a printed wiring 
board. In the second step, chip components are positioned 
on the solder paste layers thus print-coated. In 
the third step, the layers of solder paste are melted, 
thereby mounting the chip components on the printed 
wiring board. Packages such as QFPs (Quad Flat 
Packages), each containing a semiconductor device, are 
mounted on a printed wiring board in a similar method. The reflow soldering method can be successfully 
employed only in the case where the pads on the printed 
wiring board are larger than the chip component 
electrodes to be mounted on the pads. Consequently, 
each chip component occupies a relatively large surface 
area of the printed wiring board. This is a bar to an 
increase in the mount density of chip components. To 
minimize the area occupied by each chip component, 
thereby to increase the mount density, it is proposed 
that bump interconnection be employed in place of the 
reflow method. Bump interconnection, generally known as "flip chip 
method" in the field of semiconductor chips, is applied 
to mount chip components which are small
