<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a seal designed to ensure sealing (tightness) between two support pieces (2, 3) exhibiting two smooth faces (4, 5) turned towards each other and between which at least one flat part (6) of a piece (7) made from a web of flexible material and permeable to a gaseous fluid such as air is trapped. This seal made of an elastically deformable material is mainly characterised in that it has a u-shaped profile transverse section, that is to say that in a plane approximately perpendicular to the peripheral edge of the flat part (6) it has, on the one hand, two branches (13, 14) consisting of a portion of the sheet material and which branches, via a face (13A, 14A) each bear against one of the opposite faces (11, 12) of this flat part (6) and, on the other hand, a curved part (15) which, joining the two branches (13, 14) together, for its part has one face (15) turned towards the peripheral edge (10) of the flat piece.

<CLAIMS>
A seal (1) for ensuring tightness between two supporting parts (2, 3) 
having two smooth surfaces (4, 5) which face one another and 

between which at least one flat portion (6) of a part (7) is clamped 
after interposition of sealing elements, the part (7) being formed 

from a sheet of flexible material permeable to a gaseous medium 
such as air, the said seal of elastically deformable material being 

characterised in that: 

it is formed from a sheet of a material (1A) having 

an elongation before rupture of between 190 and 390 per 
cent, 
a Shore hardness of between 40 and 80, 
a tensile strength of between 60 and 120 kg/cm
2
, 
it has a U-shaped cross-section, namely it has, in a plane 
substantially perpendicular to the peripheral edge (10) of the flat 

portion (6), two arms (13, 14) formed by part of the sheet material 
and each resting by means of a surface (13A, 14A) against one of 

the opposing surfaces (11, 12) of the said flat portion (6), and a 
curved portion (15) connecting the two arms (13, 14) and having a 

surface (15A) facing the peripheral edge (10) of the flat portion, 
its surfaces (13A, 14A) rest closely against the surfaces of the 
flat portion, and 
it has, between the sheet-material parts forming the arms (13, 
14), connecting members (16) extending through the flat portion  

 
(6) of permeable material in order to ensure their connecting 

function. 
A seal according to claim 1, characterised in that firstly the sheet-material 
parts forming each arm (13, 14) have a free edge (13C, 

14C) forming a substantially cylindrical surface, and secondly a 
sealing element (17) extends between the cylindrical surface (13C, 

14C) and a circular part of the surface (11, 12) of the adjacent flat 
portion (6). 
A seal according to claim 2, characterised in that the sealing 
element (17) comprises a band of flexible material interposed 

between the edge (13C, 14C) and the surface (11, 12) at right 
angles to which the said edge (13C, 14C) extends. 
A seal according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the material (1A) forming the seal has: 


an elongation before rupture of between 250 and 330 per 
cent, 
a Shore hardness of between 55 and 65, and 
a tensile strength of between 80 and 110 kg/cm
2
. 
A seal according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that 
the material (1A) forming the seal has: 


an elongation before rupture of 290 per cent, 
a Shore hardness of 60, and 
a tensile strength of 90 kg/cm
2
. 
A seal according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that 
the material (1A) forming the seal is a synthetic rubber and, in 

particular, a polychloroprene-based material.
