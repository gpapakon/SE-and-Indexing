<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
compound 3-phenyl-7-[4-(tetrahydrofurfuryloxy)-phenyl]-1,5-dioxa-s-indacene-2,6-dione
having
a specific crystal structure. More
particularly, it relates to 3-phenyl-7-[4-(tetra-hydrofurfuryloxy)phenyl]-1,5-dioxa-s-indacene-2,6-dione
which has a crystal structure useful
for dyeing or printing hydrophobic fiber
materials particularly in a deep tint of colors.EP-A-0 494 537, JP-A-3-72571 and JP-A-4-164967
teach various benzodifuranone compounds. It has
been known that these compounds are able to dye
hydrophobic fiber materials, for example, polyester
fiber materials, in red color. However,
dyeabilities of these compounds are not yet
sufficient to meet higher requisites sought in
recent years, and a solution to this problem has
been highly desired.Thus, it is the object of the present invention to
overcome the above disadvantages of the prior art and to provide
dyes having improved properties.This object has been achieved by the
surprising findings that a specific compound
among them has polymorphism of crystals and a
specific crystal modification of the compound
endows an excellent dyeability, particularly, to
give a dyed product in a deep tint of colors.Accordingly, the present invention is 
to provide for 3-phenyl-7-[4-(tetrahydro-furfuryloxy)phenyl]-1,5-dioxa-s-indacene-2,6-dione
having a crystal structure which exhibits the
strongest peak at an angle of diffraction, 2,
of 4.7°, among peaks appearing within the range
of not smaller than 3° of 2 in an X-ray
diffraction using a Cu-Kα -ray. Hereinafter,
the crystalline structure of 3-phenyl-7-[4-(tetra-hydrofurfuryloxy)-phenyl]-1,5-dioxa-s-indacene-2,6-dione
which exhibits the characteristic peak
as mentioned above at an angle of diffraction, 2,
in an X-ray diffraction is referred to as "alpha-crystal
modification".The alpha-crystal modification in the
present invention exhibits a characteristic
sharp peak, i.e. strongest peak, at an angle of
diffraction, 2 of 4.7°, so far as 2 is within
the range of not smaller than 3°, when being
subjected to an X-ray diffraction using Cu-Kα-rays.
The whole X-ray diffraction pattern,
particularly intensity of each peak, varies
depending upon manufacturing conditions.The peaks usually appearing in an X-ray
diffraction pattern using a Cu-Kα -ray from
the alpha-crystal modification in the present
invention are listed as follows: 
Strong peak4.7°Medium peaks17.3°, 19.2°, 26.0°, 27.0°, 27.4°Weak peaks7.1°, 9.4°, 14.4°, 23.0°The figure shows an X-ray diffraction
