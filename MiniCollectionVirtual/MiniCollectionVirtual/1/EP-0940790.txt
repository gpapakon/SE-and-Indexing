<ABSTRACT>
The appts. has a actuator containing a speech memory (8) with pre-recorded acoustic reports. The memory output is connected to a pair of lines of the information line (14) serving as speech transmission lines (22,23). A loud speaker (7) is connected to the speech transmission lines to output an acoustic message from the speech memory. A display device (6) optically shows the operating condition of the speech memory. The sensors and actuators of the appts. are interface units for the household wiring. Each has a bus coupler for the bus lines (15,16) and a microprocessor. A further actuator and speech memory (25) are located outside of the secured area (1). Each speech memory contains several pre-recorded messages corresponding to the sensed event or operating condition of the sensor.

Surveillance device comprising

at least one sensor (2, 3, 4) for generating detection signals upon
detection of an event,
at least one actuator which, in response to the detection signal,
generates signals for issuing an acoustic message,
a multiwire information line (22, 23) connecting the at least one sensor
(2, 3, 4) and the at least one actuator and comprising a first pair of

wires (15,16) that forms a data bus for communicating signal telegrams
between the sensor and the actuator, and a second pair of wires (22,

23) for communicating signals of acoustic messages,
the actuator being provided with a voice source (8) issuing to the
second pair of wires (22, 23) a selected acoustic message depending

on the sensor that has responded,
and at least one speaker (7) connected to the second pair of wires
(22, 23).
The surveillance device of claim 1, wherein a display unit (6) is provided
for indicating the sensor (7) that has responded.
The surveillance device of claim 1 or 2, wherein the sensors and actuators
are designed as connecting units for in-house information distribution

technology and comprise a respective bus coupling device (17) with a
microprocessor for coupling to the first pair of wires (15, 16). 
The surveillance device of claim 3, wherein each speaker (7) comprises
a bus coupling device (17) activating the speaker when the same has

been addressed by a signal telegram.
The surveillance device of one of claims 1-4, wherein the speech source
(8) contains a plurality of different stored messages adjusted to the event

detected or the functional state of the sensor.
The surveillance device of one of claims 1-5, wherein the speech source
(8) is designed as a series mounting device (9) and is adapted to be

snapped onto a profile rack (10).
The surveillance device of one of claims 1-6, wherein the speech source
(8) comprises a bus coupling device (17).
The surveillance device of one of claims 1-7, wherein a plurality of parallel
speakers (7) is connected to the second pair of wires (22, 23).
The surveillance device of one of claims 1-8, wherein the speech source
(8) is part of an individually mountable module comprising a bus coupling

device (17) and a connector for the first pair of wires (15, 16) and a
connector for the second pair of wires (22, 23).
