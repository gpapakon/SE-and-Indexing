<ABSTRACT>
Plug-in connection comprising a joint (1) and at least one hollow chamber profile (4, 5), the joint containing connection sections (2, 3) and the connection sections having recesses for receiving joining elements, and the hollow profile having at least one hollow chamber and at least one recess for the joining element. The recesses (14, 15) in the hollow chamber profile are larger than the corresponding recess in the connection section and the region of the recess on the outside of the hollow chamber profile is covered by a cover plate (6, 7, 8, 9). The cover plate has a recess for each joining element, which recess is of the same size as the recess in the connecting section and an adhesive is arranged between the cover plate and the hollow chamber profile. The plug-in connections can be used in the construction of space-frame parts.

<CLAIMS>
Inserted joint consisting of a joint (1) and at least one hollow section (4, 5), the joint
comprising at least one connecting part (2, 3) and the connecting part having at

least one recess (14, 15) for receiving a connecting element (12, 13), and the hollow
section having at least one hollow space and at least one recess for the connecting

element (12, 13), characterised in that the hollow section is slipped on to the
connecting part and the recesses in the hollow section are oversized compared to

the corresponding recess in the connecting part and the region of the recess on the
outer face of the hollow section is covered by a cover plate (8), the cover plate has

a recess the size of the recess in the connecting part for each connecting element, an
adhesive is arranged between the cover plate and the hollow section and the

adhesive between the cover plate and the hollow section firmly connects these
components.
Inserted joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the connecting element is a
screwed connection or a riveted connection.
Inserted joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the recesses in the
connecting part are undercut grooves and the connecting elements are screws and

sliding blocks or clamping plates arranged in the undercut grooves.
Inserted joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the diameter of the recess
in the connecting part and in the cover plate corresponds to the diameter of the

connecting element and the diameter of the recess in the hollow section is larger
than the diameter of the connecting element.
Inserted joint according to claim 1, characterised in that the recess is a blind hole.
Moulded parts, load-bearing or non-load-bearing frame constructions, latticed
structures or structural components comprising inserted joints according to claim 1.
