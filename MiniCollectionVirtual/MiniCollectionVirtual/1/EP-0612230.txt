<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionSpinal Disk IirplantTechnical FieldThis invention relates to implants surgically placed into the human body, and, more particularly, to an implant placed between two vertebrae to fuse them together. Background ArtThe human spine is composed of a column of 33 bones, termed vertebrae, and their joining structures. The 24 vertebrae nearest the head, collectively termed the presaccral vertebrae, are separate bones capable of individual movement. The bodies of the presaccral vertebrae are generally connected by anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments and by discs of fibrocartilage, termed intervertebral disks, positioned between opposing faces of adjacent vertebral bodies. These mobile vertebrae may be classified by their position and function into either cervical, thoracic, or lumbar vertebrae. The remaining 9 vertebrae are fused to form the saccrum (5 vertebrae) and the coccyx (4 vertebrae) and are incapable of individual movement. This column of vertebrae and intervertebral disks form a central axis for supporting the load of the head and torso. The vertebral body and the dorsal vertebral arch of each of the 24 mobile presaccral vertebrae enclose an opening, termed the vertebral foramen, through which the spinal cord, a column of nerve tissue which communicates nerve impulses between the brain and the rest of the body, and the spinal nerve roots pass and are protected from damage.The presaccral vertebrae are normally held in a precise relation to each other by the intervertehral disks, the longitudinal ligaments, 

 and the musculature of the body. These vertebrae can move relative to adjacent vertebrae in various manners, permitting the head to be turned relative to the body and providing a wide range of flexibility to the spine. The movement between individual pairs of vertebrae is limited to prevent local pressure on the spinal cord or excessive bending of the spinal cord. Such pressure or bending could possibly result in disorders associated with blockage of the nerve impulses traveling along the spinal cord, in turn producing pain, paresthesia, or loss of motor control which must be resolved by removing the causative condition. The nerve conduction disorders may also be associated with the intervertebral disks or the bones themselves. One such condition is a herniation of the intervertebral disk, in which a small amount of tissue protrudes from the sides of the disk into the foramen to compress the spinal cord. A second common condition involves the development of small bone spurs,

Claims
1. A spinal disk implant, comprising a solid body having four sides and a pair of spaced-apart, opposed bases, the four sides including spaced- apart, opposed anterior and posterior faces, and a pair of spaced-apart, opposed transverse faces, each transverse face having an anterior platform adjacent to the anterior face, the anterior platform being spaced apart from an opposed anterior platform by a maximum anterior platform spacing, and a posterior ledge oriented at an insertion angle relative to an opposed posterior ledge of an opposed transverse face, at least one of the posterior ledges having thereon a pattern of serrations; and a ridge on at least one of the transverse faces positioned between the anterior platform and the posterior ledge and extending in a direction perpendicular to the bases, a top of the ridge being spaced apart from the opposed transverse face by an amount greater than the anterior platform spacing.
2. The implant of claim 1, wherein the implant is made of a material that bonds to natural bone.
3. The implant of claim 1, wherein the implant is made at least in part of a biocompatible orthopedic polymer material, a ceramic or a ceramic-coated metal. 4. The implant of claim 3, wherein the ceramic is hydroxylapatite.
5. The implant of claim 3, wherein the metal is selected from the group consisting of titanium and a titani-um alloy. 


 6. The implant of claim 1, wherein the implant is microporous.
7. The implant of claim 1, wherein the insertion angle is from 0 to about 10 degrees. 8. The implant of claim l, further including a pattern of serrations on at least one of the anterior platforms, the pattern of serrations extending in a direction perpendicular to the bases. 9. The implant of claim 1, wherein at least one of the anterior platforms, the posterior platforms, or the ridge is bowed outwardly when viewed perpendicular to the anterior face.
10. The implant of claim 1, wherein the ridge is bowed outwardly when viewed perpendicular to the anterior face.
11. A process for implanting a spinal implant, comprising the steps of: providing a spinal implant comprising a solid body having four sides and a pair of spaced-apart, opposed bases, the four sides including spaced- apart, opposed anterior and posterior faces, and a pair of spaced-apart, opposed transverse faces, each transverse face having an anterior platform adjacent to the anterior face, the anterior platform being spaced apart from the opposed anterior platform by a maximum anterior platform spacing, and a posterior ledge oriented at an insertion angle relative to an opposed posterior ledge of the opposed transverse face, at least one of the posterior ledges having thereon a pattern of serrations, and a ridge on at least one of the transverse faces positioned between the anterior platform and the posterior ledge and extending in the direction perpendicular to the bases, the top 


of the ridge being spaced apart from the opposed transverse face by an amount greater than the anterior platform spacing; and placing the spinal implant between two vertebrae of a person's body, with the ridge of the spinal implant lying transverse to the vertebrae and the anterior platform placed between the anterior cortical bone regions of the vertebrae.
