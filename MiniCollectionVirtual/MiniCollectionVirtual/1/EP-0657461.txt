<ABSTRACT>
A wastewater-free process for disposing of solid-containing residues of an organochlorosilane synthesis is described. By treating the residues with alkali metal hydroxides and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxides and/or alkali metal carbonates and/or alkaline earth metal carbonates and recycling the aqueous phase into the process, products are obtained which can be landfilled on the surface.

A wastewater-free process for disposing of
solids-containing residues of an organochlorosilane

synthesis by

a) treating in an aqueous phase with compounds of
elements of the first and second main group of the

Periodic Table of the Elements the solids to be
ejected from the process,
b) separating the resulting suspension into a solids-containing
phase and an aqueous phase and
c) recycling the aqueous phase to stage a),

characterized in that the residues of an organochlorosilane
synthesis are admixed in stage a) with alkali

metal hydroxides and/or alkaline earth metal hydroxides
and/or alkali metal carbonates and/or alkaline earth

metal carbonates.
A process according to claim 1, characterized
in that, when NaOH is used, a pH of at least 6,

preferably from 6 to 7.5, is maintained.
A process according to claim 1, characterized
in that, when Ca(OH)
2
 is used, a pH of at least 4.5 is
maintained.
A process according to claim 1, characterized
in that, when Na
2
CO
3
 is used, a pH of at least 5 is
maintained.
A process according to claim 1, characterized
in that, when CaCO
3
 is used, a pH of at least 4.0 is
maintained.
