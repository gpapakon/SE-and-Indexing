<ABSTRACT>
A pattern output apparatus and a pattern output 
method, in which data received from an external 

apparatus such as a host computer is developed to bit 
map pattern data on a page unit basis as output 

information and the bit map pattern data is outputted. 
The pattern output apparatus comprises a converter for 

converting form data to intermediate data, a memory to 
store the form data converted to the intermediate data 

by the converter, and an output controller for 
converting input data which is inputted from an 

external apparatus to intermediate data, for producing 
a pattern based on the input data converted to the 

intermediate data and the form data stored in the 
memory, and for outputting the pattern. The input data 

and the form data are expressed by different command 
systems. The intermediate data has a data format 

peculiar to the pattern output apparatus. The 
intermediate data is the data obtained by processing 

the input data or form data so as to easily produce the 
pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pattern output
apparatus such as a printing apparatus or the like and
a pattern output method, in which data received from an
external apparatus such as a host computer or the like
is developed as output information to bit map pattern
data of a page unit and the bit map pattern data is
outputted.Hitherto, such a kind of printing apparatus uses a
general method whereby bit map pattern data of one page
is developed into an image memory on the basis of input
data (printer language such as a PDL or the like
comprising a character code, a control code, and the
like) received from a host computer and the result of
the development in the image memory is converted to the
video signal and is transferred to a printer mechanism
section.A printing apparatus such that a plurality of
print command systems are supported in one printing
apparatus has been also generally widespread.It is a general way that separately from the input
data, form data is transmitted from the host computer
and is registered into the printing apparatus and the 
registered form is overlapped into the input data,
thereby forming output form overlay pattern.In this instance, in the case where the form to be
overlaid into each page is the same form, when the form
data is transmitted every page, it takes a data
transfer time from the host computer. Therefore,
generally, before the input data is transmitted, the
form data is registered into a memory (for example,
RAM) of the printing apparatus and the form data which
has once been registered is held until the deletion is
instructed from the host computer or a power source is
cut off. By merely instructing the form to be overlaid
into the input data any time, it is possible to easily
overlap the input data and the form and to form and
output a form overlay pattern.Further, by adding a secondary memory device such
as a hard disc or the like to the printing apparatus
and by registering form data into the secondary memory
device, a number of kinds of form data can be
registered into the printing apparatus. Even if the
power source is once cut off, the registered form data
is not lost.Consequently, as for the form data which has once
been registered in the secondary memory device, by
merely inputting a command (instruction information) to
instruct a form to be overlaid to the input data which
is sent from the host computer, it is possible to 
easily overlap the received input data and the form
stored in the secondary memory device and to produce
and output a form
