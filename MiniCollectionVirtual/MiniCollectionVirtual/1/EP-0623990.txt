<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a winding machine for winding commutator armatures (22) for electric motors, having at least one switching apparatus (10) and one clamping device (18), which is operatively connected to said switching apparatus (10) and can rotate about a clamping axis (x), for accommodating the armature shaft (28) of a commutator armature (22), as well as having an armature shaft bearing (58), which is opposite the clamping device (18), is arranged in a holder (34) and is inside winding sleeves (36) which engage over the commutator (26) in the clamping axis (x), for accommodating and supporting that free end, which points away from the clamping device (18) of the armature shaft (28) of a commutator armature (22) which is clamped in the clamping device (18), two switching apparatuses (10, 10'), which have clamping devices (18, 18') pointing in the opposite direction as well as parallel clamping axes (x, x'), are arranged symmetrically with respect to one rotation axis (z), and the clamping devices (18, 18') can be moved alternately by a rotational movement about the rotation axis (2) into the position opposite the armature shaft bearing (58). The rotatable arrangement of two switching apparatuses allows a further commutator armature to be clamped on and positioned outside the winding region simultaneously during a winding process.

Winding machine for winding commutator rotors (22) for 
electric motors, with at least one switch unit (10) and 

a clamping device (18) actively connected with this and 
rotatable about a clamping axis (x) to hold the rotor 

shaft (28) of a commutator rotor (22), and opposite the 
clamping device (18), arranged in a holder (34) and 

lying on the clamping axis (x) within winding tubes 
(36) overlapping the commutator (26), rotor shaft 

bearings (58) to hold and support the free end, 
pointing away from the clamping device (18), of the 

rotor shaft (28) of a commutator rotor (22) held in the 
clamping device (18),
 
characterized in that
 
the switch unit(s) (10) is(are) arranged symmetrically 

about an axis of rotation (z) and, by rotation about 
this axis, the clamping device(s) (18) can be moved 

alternately into the position opposite that of the 
rotor shaft bearing (58). 
Winding machine according to claim 1, characterized in 
that two switch units (10, 10') with clamping devices 

(18, 18') facing in opposite directions and with 
parallel clamping axes (x, x') are arranged

rotation about this axis, the clamping devices (18, 

18') can be moved alternately into the position 
opposite that of the rotor shaft bearing (58).
