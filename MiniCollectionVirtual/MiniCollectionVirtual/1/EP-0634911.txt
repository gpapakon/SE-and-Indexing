A spinal osteosynthesis device comprising: 

bone anchorage elements (8; 22; 24), for example, vertebral screws, hooks,.. , each 
element comprising a vertebral anchorage portion (9, 23, 25), a cylindrical body (12) wherein 

there are arranged at least two longitudinal slots (13) delimiting between them at least two 
arms (14), as well as an internal thread (15), and an internal expansion screw (17), made 

suitable for being screwed inside the body while producing a radial divergence of the arms,
 
characterized in that it comprises: 
longitudinal rods (2) flexible in their state of use in a patient, 
and connectors (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 61) adapted to allow them to be joined to corresponding 
anchorage elements and the rods, each connector comprising an L-shaped base component 

(25), pierced on either side by two bores (31) and a hole (27) for receiving the expandable 
body (12) of an anchorage element (8; 22; 24), grooves (32) being arranged in the said base 

component in the extension of the said bores, the connector being provided with a clamp part 
(28) for fixing the rods, which can be secured on the base component by a tightening element 

(34), and on one side thereof there are formed grooves complementary to the grooves of the 
base component, and the rods being accommodated in the bores and the grooves; the whole 

of the device forming a flexible structure in its state of use in a patient. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the rods have a high elastic yield 
point and a high breaking strength. 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the bores (31) and the grooves (32) 
are either circular or non-circular, for example, oblong. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it comprises a sacral 
fixing connector (7) provided with two bores (44) with parallel axes (XX) whose projections in a 

longitudinal axial plane (P) of the connector has an inclination (A) to the perpendiculars to the 
sides of the connector (7) contained in the said plane (P), and the axes (XX) have an 

inclination (B) to the said axial plane (P).  
 
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the sacral connector (7) is provided 
with a rounded shoulder (43) whose ends open out in bores (31) for the passing of a loop (2a) 

for the connection between the two rods (2). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it comprises anterior 
bearing plates (55a, 55b) on the spine, each provided with fixing means (56) on the 

corresponding vertebra, adapted to be capable of assuming the shape of the concavity of the 
said vertebra, and each pierced by a hole (57) for the passing of the bone anchorage element 

(8, 22, 24) passing through the connector (3..) mounted on the said bearing plate. 
A device according to claim 6. characterized in that each plate is either rigid (55a) with 
a contour (58) adapted to the concavity of the associated vertebra, or (55b) of a sufficiently 

small thickness to render it flexible so as to allow it to fit the said concavity. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that it comprises at least 
one connector (61) adapted to form a bridge above a fractured vertebra, comprising two plates 

(62, 63) each pierced by a bore for the passing of a bone anchorage element (24), provided 
with securing parts (65)
 for fixing the rods (2), means for the longitudinal adjustment of the 
plates with respect to one another, and means (78) for the connection of the said plates to one 

another, one (63) of the plates having a set back (75) to allow its end portion (72) to come to 
bear on the corresponding end portion (71) of the other plate (62). 
A device according to claim 8, characterized in that the said adjustment and fixing 
means include a slot (76) arranged in one (63) of the plates, at least one threaded hole (77) in 

the other plate (62) opposite the slot, and a connecting screw (78), the plates being curved to 
adapt to the patient's anatomical curve by being joined in one another's extension. 
A device according to claim 9, characterized in that asperities (79) are formed on the 
surfaces of the plates (62, 63) bearing on one another, for example, serrations on either side 

of the slot (76) and of the hole (77) for the passing of the screw. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that the flexible rods (2) 
have a circular or other cross section, for example, an oblong cross section.  

 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in that the flexible rods are 
made of a bio-compatible material. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the hole (27) for receiving the 
expandable body in the connector has a helical groove (20) improving the mechanical fixing of 

the anchorage elements to the connectors. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 13, characterized in that the vertebral screws 
(24) are without an axial stop. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 14, characterized in that the flexible 
longitudinal rods are constituted by the assembly of wires (85; 88) forming for example strands 

(86; 87). 
A device according to claim 15, characterized in that the strand (86; 87) is formed of 
swaged wires (85) or redrawn wires (88).
