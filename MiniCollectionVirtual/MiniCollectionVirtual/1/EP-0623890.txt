<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image processing method and
apparatus, for improving the properties (e.g., improving the comparison
precision, reducing the processing amount, decreasing the amount of data,
etc.) in the case when conducting image processing for analyzing or
recognizing a digitalized image (e.g., fingerprints, stamped images,
diagrams, characters, etc.) using an image processing apparatus (i.e.,
hardware/software in a computer, electronic switching machine,
communication control unit, IC card, image recognition device, image
comparing device, image testing unit, or the like).In the following, an example of the case in which the objective
image according to the present invention is a fingerprint will be
explained. Essentially, a fingerprint is the crest pattern of the ridges of a
finger. Furthermore, since the trough lines (the space in between the
ridge lines) are defined by the ridge lines, it is possible to use a pattern
formed by trough lines in place of the ridge lines as a fingerprint. For
the sake of convenience, the lines defining the fingerprint will be called
"fingerprint lines". Various fingerprint input devices exist for
confirming an individual's identity, such as a method for inputting a
fingerprint from an image pick-up unit (e.g., CCD (Charged Coupled
Device)) camera, a prism method (e.g., see Shimizu et al., "Entry Method
of Fingerprint Image with a Prism - Comparison between Total and Light
Path Separation Method", IECE Journal, vol. J68-D, No. 3, pp. 414-415
(1985)), and a hologram method (e.g., see Igaki, et al., "Personal 
Identification Terminal Using a Holographic Fingerprint Sensor",
Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers of Japan (IEICE
Technical Report, PRU87-31, pp. 27-33, (1987)).The fingerprint image of analog information inputted from an
image pick-up unit is converted into a gray-scale image of a digitalized
fingerprint by means of an analog/digital (A/D) converter. The gray-scale
image of this fingerprint is represented by the coordinates (X, Y)
which are an image memory pixel address, as well as by means of the
brightness of the pixels which form the structural components of each
image memory pixel address. The designation method for the X and Y
axes is optional and may be freely selected. The fingerprint image may
be formed by converting the concavities and convexities of the
fingerprint directly into a binary image.Corrections can then be conducted on the gray-scale image of the
fingerprint by means of leveling and utilizing the orientation
