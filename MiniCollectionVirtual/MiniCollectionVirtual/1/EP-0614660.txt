Multiple emulsion being presented in the form of a
water/oil/water emulsion constituted by a dispersed phase

which is an emulsion of water/oil type and an aqueous
dispersion medium, characterized


in that the aqueous dispersion medium is a gelled aqueous
phase and does not contain an emulsifier,
in that the gelling agent contained in the aqueous dispersion
phase is constituted by a base solution of one or more

compounds chosen from polyglyceryl methacrylate, carbomers
and modified carbomers, and
in that the quantity of polyglyceryl methacrylate gelling
agent is from 5 to 15% of the total composition.
Multiple emulsion according to claim 1, characterized
in that one or more hydrosoluble active ingredients are

incorporated in the aqueous phase of the water/oil emulsion
and/or in the aqueous dispersion phase.
Multiple emulslon according to one of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that one or more liposoluble active

ingredients are incorporated in the oily phase of the
water/oil emulsion.
Multiple emulsion according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the hydrosoluble active ingredients are

chosen from sodium lactate, extracts of hafnia biolysate,
extracts of Klebsillia pneumoniae biolysate and hydrosoluble

sunscreens.
Multiple emulsion according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the liposoluble active ingredients are

chosen from the palmitate of vitamin A, liposoluble
sunscreens, nonsaponifiable matter of vegetable origin, oils

of vegetable origin, tocopherol acetates, natural
tocopherols, farnesol and natural or synthetic ceramides.
Multiple emulsion according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the volumes of the different phases are

such that:

the internal aqueous phase represents 20 to 30% of the
total composition, 
the oily phase represents 10 to 20% of the total
composition,
the external aqueous phase represents 50 to 60% of the
total composition.
Preparation process for a multiple emulsion according
to one of claims 1 to 6, including:


preparation of the dispersed phase by mixing, preferably
while heating, the aqueous phase and the oily phase under

vigorous agitation and
the mixture of said dispersed phase with the external
aqueous phase, preferably at room temperature, under gentle

agitation until the formation of the multiple emulsion,
process characterized


in that the aqueous phase is gelled and does not contain an
emulsifier, and
in that the gelling agent which is used to prepare the
external aqueous phase is chosen from:


a solution based on polyglycerol methacrylate,
carbomers,
modified carbomers.
Cosmetic composition intended in particular for sun
protection, characterized in that it contains a multiple

emulsion according to one of claims 1 to 6 and the usual
excipients for a multiple emulsion.
Cosmetic composition according to claim 8,
characterized in that it is presented in the form of a sun

lotion.
Cosmetic composition intended for skin which is
prone to acne, very dry skin, damaged skin, wrinkled skin,

characterized in that it contains a multiple emulsion
according to one of claims 1 to 6 and the usual excipients.
Use of a multiple emulsion according to one of
claims 1 to 6, for the preparation of a cosmetic composition

as defined in claims 8 to 10.
