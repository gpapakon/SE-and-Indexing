<ABSTRACT>
To remove moisture from an edge region (5) of moving metal strip (S), apparatus is provided which comprises a hollow housing (7) having a slot (9) in a wall which permits the edge region (5) of the strip (S) to pass through the slot (9), nozzles (19, 21) in the housing (7) direct jets of air on to the upper and lower surfaces of the strip. Any moisture on the strip (S) is blasted off the strip into the housing (7) from where it is exhausted with the air.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for 
removing moisture from an edge region of metal strip 
that is moving in the direction of its length. In 
particular, the apparatus is for removing moisture from 
an edge region of aluminium strip. The final rolling stages of aluminium strip 
consist of rolling the strip through a number of 
rolling mill stands, sometimes arranged in tandem, so 
that the strip leaving the last stand is of the 
required gauge. This strip is then coiled for 
subsequent use. The rolls of the mill stands are 
cooled by having liquid coolant applied to them on the 
entry side. It has been the practice to employ 
kerosene as the liquid coolant. However, for various 
reasons, it would be preferable to use water as the 
liquid coolant, but it is absolutely vital to keep 
water off the strip on the exit side of the mill when 
it is coiled because water left on the surface of the 
coiled strip dries and causes considerable staining of 
the strip rendering it unacceptable to many potential 
users. Steps may be taken to remove any moisture 
remaining on the upper and lower surfaces of the strip  
 
downstream of the last stand to avoid staining of the 
aluminium strip. However, it is known for a thin layer of 
moisture to remain on the longitudinally extending edge 
regions of the metal strip and particularly moisture taking 
the form of a bead which attaches itself to the extreme edge 
of the strip. When the strip is coiled the moisture on the 
edge region of the strip, particularly the bead of moisture 
on the edge region, seeps back into the coil between 
adjacent turns and, as it dries, it stains the aluminium. 
For many applications of the aluminium strip, staining of 
the edges is not acceptable. In US-A-4601112 there is described apparatus for 
removing moisture from an edge region of metal strip moving 
in the direction of its length. The edge of the strip 
projects into a slot in a housing and engages with the 
periphery of a rotating wiping roller. The housing is 
biassed towards the edge of the strip so that the edge of 
the roller bears against the edge of the strip. The 
rotating roller removes liquid retained on the edge of the 
strip and means are provided for extracting air and moisture 
from the housing. In US-A-1918207 there is disclosed the feature of 
directing air under pressure onto the upper and lower 
surfaces of the edge regions of metal strip to remove 
moisture from the edge regions. GB-A-2111885 seeks to overcome the problem of moisture 
on the edges of moving

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for removing moisture from an edge region of 
metal strip (s) moving in the direction of its length 

comprising a hollow housing (7) having a slot (9) in an 
outer wall thereof; means for supporting the housing 

relative to the path taken by the strip so as to permit the 
edge region of the moving strip to project into the slot and 

be in communication with the interior of the housing; means 
in the housing for removing moisture from the edge region of 

the strip as it passes through the housing and means (23) 
for extracting air and moisture from the housing;
 
characterised in that
 
   detector means (15,17) comprising a transmitter (15) and 

a receiver (17) are located in the housing and serves to 
detect the position of the edge of the strip relative to the 

housing;
 
   means (13), acting in response to the output of said 

detector means serves to automatically displace the housing 
(7) in the direction towards or away from the path taken by 

the strip so that the housing remains at a desired position 
relative to the edge of the strip; and where said moisture 

removal means comprises nozzle assemblies (19,21) in the 
housing by which air under pressure is directed on to the 

upper and lower surfaces of the edge region of the strip, 
the air being directed towards the edge of the strip so as 

to remove any moisture present on the strip.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that 
the housing (7) is mounted on a slider (11) and an electric 

motor (13) under the control of the detector means displaces 
the slider in the direction towards or away from the path 

taken by the strip. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 and 2 characterised in 
that the nozzle assembles (19, 21) are arranged such that 

the air under pressure directed on to the upper surface of 
the strip is substantially at right angles to the air under 

pressure directed onto the lower surface of the strip. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3 characterised 
in that
 
   means are provided in the housing for determining the 

moisture content of the air therein.
