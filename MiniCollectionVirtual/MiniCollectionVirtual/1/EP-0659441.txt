<ABSTRACT>
A curable cyanoacrylate adhesive composition intended for 
medical and/or veterinary uses is sterilized in liquid form by gamma 

irradiation. The composition comprises 

a) a cyanoacrylate monomer 
b) a combination of an anionic stabilizer and a free-radical 
stabilizer in amounts effective to stabilize the composition 

during irradiation and to stabilize the sterilized composition 
during storage prior to cure, wherein the free radical 

stabilizer is a selected phenolic antioxidant (but not 
including hydroquinone). 
The preferred free radical stabilizer is butylated 
hydroxyanisole. After irradiation the cyanoacrylate monomer is 

substantially ungelled.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the method of making
a sterilized cyanoacrylate adhesive composition. The
composition is suitable for bonding a wide range of substrates but
is especially intended for medical and/or veterinary uses such as
wound closure and general surgical applications.There is considerable experience in the use of cyanoacrylate
adhesives in medical and veterinary practice (Shantha etal.
"Developments and Applications of Cyanoacrylate Adhesives", J.
Adhesion Sci. Technol Vol. 3, No. 4, pp 237-260 (1989)).
Cyanoacrylate adhesives have been proposed for surgical treatment
such as wound adhesives, hemostatics and tissue adhesives,
particularly for sutureless skin bonding. It is desirable that an
adhesive for medical or veterinary use should be sterilizable
(Al-Khawan etal. "Cyanoacrylate adhesives of potential medical
use", Adhesion 7 (Allen K.W.) Applied Science Publishers, Chap. 6,
109-133 (1983).Cyanoacrylate adhesives must be stabilized against anionic and
free radical polymerization. WO 8100701 Krall describes a methyl
cyanoacrylate adhesive composition for sealing fallopian tubes in
female sterilization containing a polymerisation inhibitor such as
an organic carboxylic acid, SO2 and an antioxidant selected from 
hydroquinone, hydroquinone mono-methyl ether, butylated
hydroxyanisole and their mixtures.A cyanoacrylate adhesive composition for medical use is
commercially available under the Trade Mark HISTOACRYL BLUE from B.
Braun Melsungen AG. This composition is not sterilized.Several methods which are available for positively sterilising
liquids could be considered for application to cyanoacrylate
adhesives. These include ionising radiation (electron accelerators
or gamma radiation from a radioactive source such as Cobalt 60 or
Caesium 137), dry-heat, steam, gas, filtration and liquid
sterilisation. Aseptic filling of the adhesive immediately
following manufacture is also an option. Factors to consider in
choosing a sterilisation method include (a) the reactive nature of
cyanoacrylates, (b) contamination due to induced chemical changes in
the adhesive composition, (c) subsequent storage stability, (d)
effect on bonding performance (immediate and long-term), (e)
viscosity changes, (f) effect on the package or vessel used to
contain the adhesive and (g) the maintenance of sterility on storage
up to the time of utilisation.Most of the above sterilisation methods are unsuitable or
suffer from severe limitations in their applicability to
cyanoacrylate adhesives. Electron beam accelerators have
