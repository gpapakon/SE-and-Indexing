<ABSTRACT>
Supplied with first and second signals from first 
and second control units (19, 29), first and second 

reading units (17, 27) read first and second readout ATM 
signals from first and second primary memory units (15, 

25) which memorize an ATM signal (11). The second 
control unit produces the second reading signal when a 

predetermined interval lapses after supplied with a first 
reading start signal from the first control unit. A 

first processing unit (21) processes the first readout 
ATM signal into a first STM signal and a first processed 

content signal, A second processing unit (31) processes, 
in response to the first processed content signal, the 

second readout ATM signal into a second STM signal. An 
output reading unit (35) reads first and second output STM 

signals at the same time from first and second secondary 
memory units (23, 33) which memorize the first and the 

second readout STM signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cell processing system and a cell processing method for
processing an input first-type signal, which is one of an asynchronous transfer mode
("ATM") signal and a synchronous transfer mode or module ("STM") signal, to
produce an output second-type signal, which is the other of an ATM signal and an STM
signal.A conventional such cell processing system comprises : first and second primary memory
means for receiving the input first-type signal and memorising it as first and second
memorised first-type signals, respectively; first and second processing means for
processing first and second readout first-type signals, respectively, read out from the
first and second primary memory means, respectively, to produce first and second
generated second-type signals, respectively; first and second secondary memory means
for receiving the first and second generated second-type signals, respectively, and
memorising them as first and second memorised second-type signals, respectively; and
an output selecting means for selecting one of first and second readout second-type
signals read out from the first and second secondary memory means in dependence upon
first and second selection signals and outputting the selected signal as the output second-type
signal.Examples of such a system and method are described in DE-C1- 4 123 851 and EP-A- 0 531 772.In such a conventional cell processing system, either the first and second processing
means must stop processing the first-type signals while the output selecting means is
changing its selection, or it must be accepted that part of the second-type signal will be
lost while the output selecting means is changing its selection.The present invention is concerned with enabling the system to continue processing the
first-type signals while the output selecting device changes its selection without a part
of the second-type signal being lost.The system of one aspect of the present invention is characterised by: a first reading
control means for producing a first reading signal and a first reading start signal
representing a start of the first reading signal; a second reading control means
responsive to the first reading start signal for producing a second reading signal when
a first predetermined time interval elapses after supply with the first reading start signal;
first and second reading means for reading out the first and second memorised first-type
signals, respectively, as the first and second readout first-type signals, respectively, when 
the first
