<ABSTRACT>
A container tube (1) and a hinged cap (6, 16) both 
cylindrical, with the tube printed on one front face and 

another rear face, in which the finger cot area (7) of the 
cap is centred in relation to the printing on the front. 

The neck of the tube and an internal skirt in the cap are 
provided with longitudinal teeth (4) and (17, 18) which 

correspond with each other in the longitudinal assembly 
of both. The cap is provided with a reference, by means 

of which it is possible to centre the finger cot area with 
relation to the printing on the front of the tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to container tubes for 
various products provided with a closer cap or lid for 
the tube, in which the tube has a neck through which 
the product can flow to the exterior and to which the 
cap is connected. (see EP-A-0 410 913). The exterior of these tubes is usually printed 
with texts, drawings, etc. allusive to the product contained, 
because of which there is a current tendency in 
containers with a cap or lid provided with a hinge to 
situate the finger cot or presser area of the lid in 
such a way that it becomes centred in relation to the 
main printed area of the tube, which means in relation 
to the front printing. When dealing with tubes and hinged caps which 
are oval in shape, the existence of this fact is already 
known, with the neck of the tubular container being made 
with a guide on which an internal protrusion from the 
cap fits, and this neck guide being centred in relation 
to the main printing. In these oval or eliptical containers, the printing 
is relatively simple due to the shape of the section, 
but the centring of the head with its guide in 
relation to the front printing cannot be carried out on 
a normal injection machine, which makes it necessary to 
carry out this operation on each container individually, 
with the undoubtedly high cost that this entails for 
each container. As far as is known, containers of this kind which 
are circular have not been produced up to now in which 
the fact that the finger cot area of the cap is centred  
 
in relation to the main printing on the tube is also fulfilled. The object of the invention is therefore to provide 
a container made up of a container tube provided 
with a neck or head, with a circular cross-section, and a 
hinged cap, also circular, according to which the finger 
cot in the cap is situated in a centred position in relation 
to the main printing on the tube. In general terms, and as a guide, a conventional 
technique is used in order to produce a container of this 
type, starting with the extrusion of the tube, followed 
by the printing of the tube, the injection of the neck or 
head of the tube and the fitting of the cap. In this 
sequence, the order for injection of the neck of the tube 
and the printing can be altered. Following these classical operations, and in an 
appropriate installation or assembly, the centring processes 
of the front printing with the finger cot area are 
carried out, so that once they have been suitably positioned, 
the assembly of tube and cap can be carried out. As

<CLAIMS>
A cylindrical tube (1) with 
a cap (6) having a lid (16) connected to said cap via a hinge (8), including a container 

tube (1) closed and sealed at one end and provided with 
a circular neck with a lower ring-shaped recess (3) at 

its other end, and a cap (6) that is connected to the said 
neck and has an outermost skirt 

(7) that adjusts to the outer surface of the container 
tube and two inner skirts, between which the circular 

neck of the container tube (1) is received, and of which 
the larger one is provided with an internal lip (10) 

which is housed in the ring-shaped recess (3) in the 
said neck of the container tube, said container 

tube having printed matter on its diametrally opposed 
front and rear outer surfaces, whereby 

both the container tube (1) and the 
cap (6) have a circular cross section, 

and whereby 
said larger inner skirt (9) is provided with a portion, 

close to where it starts from the cap, with a series 
of longitudinal teeth (12) characterized in that the neck of the container tube 

has, between its free upper end and the area close to the ring-shaped 
recess, a portion occupied by a series of longitudinal teeth (4) which 

take up the whole side surface of this portion, by means of which it  
 

engages with the teeth in the cap (6) when both 
are longitudinally assembled, and in that the cap (6) contains a 

portion (13) to act as a reference, which is made at an 
angular distance from the portion of a finger cot area (7), which is a 

recess formed in the outermost skirt to facilitate opening of said lid (16), 
so that the latter can be adjusted in relation to the 

main printing on the container tube.  
 
Cylindrical tube 
according to 

claim 1, characterized in that the toothed portion of 
the neck of the tube finishes at the upper end of the neck in a front end wall, centrally 

holed (15) with a smaller diameter, into which 
the smaller innermost skirt of the cap fits, with the 

whole of this front wall fitting tightly into the base 
of the cap from which the two inner skirt emerge and 

being taken in between the said skirts. 
Cylindrical tube 
according to 

claim 1, characterized in that the toothed portion of 
the neck of the tube culminates in the same diameter as 

the neck itself, with the upper end of the neck resting on the base 
of the cap from which the two inner skirts emerge and 

being taken in between the said skirts. 
Cylindrical tube 
according to 

claim 1, characterized in that the reference in the cap 
for its centring in relation to the printing on the tube 

is an inner rib (13) in the cap, between the outermost 
skirt and the larger of the two inner ones, 

which is oversized and separated an angular span from 
the finger cot. 
Cylindrical tube, 
according to 

Claim 1, characterized in that the teeth (4, 12, 18) in 
the neck of the tube and in the cap are preferably of a 

triangular cross section.
