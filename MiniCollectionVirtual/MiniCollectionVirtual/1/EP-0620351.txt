<ABSTRACT>
In order that it be possible for one person to install a door closer (6) with an opening-out arm (7), which is fastened on a door (2) mounted rotatably in a fixed frame (1), without difficulty although the opening-out arm (7) is spring-loaded in the direction away from the fixed frame (1), it is proposed that, after the installation of the door closure (6) on the door (2) and of the sliding rail (12) on the fixed frame (1) or the like, a sliding element (11) be pushed onto said sliding rail, which sliding element is then connected, in a catching or latching manner, to a bearing bolt (17) on the sliding-element-side end (10) of the opening-out arm (11). This connection is fitted preferably with the aid of a securing element (23) which can be plugged in a latching manner onto the sliding element (11). In a predetermined open position of the door (2), the sliding element (11) may interact in a latching manner with a stay element (34) on the sliding rail (12) and thus form a staying device for the open door (2).

<CLAIMS>
A door closer (6) whose stay arm (7) is non-rotatably connected 
at one end to the door closer drive shaft (16) and at the other end 

carries a slide element (11) which is at least displaceable in a slide 
bar (12) mounted to a fixed frame (1) or the like of the door (2) and 

which can preferably also be arrested in an open position, wherein a 
mounting pin (17) or the like is mounted on the end (10) of the stay arm 

that is towards the slide element, rotatably in the slide element (11), 
and the mounting pin (17) can be connected to the slide element (11) by 

snapping or latching engagement, characterised in that the slide element 
(11) has a fork-like receiving means (18) for the mounting pin, wherein 

the fork limbs (19, 20) of the receiving means (18) can be resiliently 
spread open and extend transversely to the mounting pin (17). 
A door closer according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
snapping or latching connection of the mounting pin (17) to the slide 

element (11) can be secured by a securing element (23). 
A door closer according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
securing element (23) and the slide element (11) can be connected by 

snapping or latching engagement. 
A door closer according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the fork limbs (19, 20) face with their free ends 

away from the fixed frame (1) and that to form undercut configurations 
the free ends of the fork limbs point towards each other or carry 

suitable thickening portions (21, 22). 
A door closer according to claim 4 characterised in that the 
fork-like receiving means (18) is in the form of a mounting bore which is 

cut into and corresponds to the cross-section of the mounting pin (17) or 
the mounting pin portion (24) engaging thereinto.  

 
A door closer according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the slide portion (11) is in the form of a slider 

whose middle region is formed by the fork-like receiving means (18) and 
whose end regions each carry a respective projecting bar portion (26, 27) 

extending approximately parallel to the associated fork limb (19, 20). 
A door closer according to claim 6 characterised in that the 
securing element (23) has a region which is of U-shaped cross-section, or 

it is of U-shape, wherein the limbs (28, 29) of the U respectively engage 
between a fork limb (19, 20) and a bar portion (26, 27) of the slide 

portion (11). 
A door closer according to claim 7 characterised in that 
disposed on each limb (28, 29) of the U-shape of the securing element 

(23) is a lateral longitudinal ridge which snappingly or latchingly 
engages behind an outer longitudinal ridge, which projects in the 

opposite direction, on the associated fork limb (19, 20). 
A door closer according to at least one of claims 4 to 8 
characterised in that a portion (24) of the mounting pin (17), which 

portion is of reduced diameter, engages between the fork limbs (19, 20). 
A door closer according to at least one of the preceding claims 

characterised in that, when the door (2) is open, a latching receiving 
means (32) at the end of the slide element (11) which is remote from the 

fixed frame (1) latches with a resiliently deflectable locking element 
which is adjustable in the longitudinal direction of the slide bar (12). 
A door closer according to claim 10 characterised in that the 
latching receiving means (32) of the slide element (11) is formed by one 

of the bar portions (26, 27) at the end regions thereof, and the securing 
element (23).  

 
A door closer according to claim 10 or claim 11 characterised in 
that the locking element (34) is a two-armed lever (33) rotatably mounted 

in a housing (36) mounted slidably and fixably on the slide bar (12). 
A door closer according to claim 12 characterised in that the 
one lever arm (35) of the lever (3), which laterally projects beyond the 

housing (36) in the direction of displacement (13), carries a retaining 
latch (37), and the other lever arm (38) bears against an inclined run-on 

surface (39) of a slider (40) which is displaceable in the longitudinal 
direction of the slide bar (12) against the resistance of a return spring 

(43). 
A door closer according to claim 13 characterised in that the 
slider (40) has a blind bore (45) for at least partially accommodating 

the return spring (43), one end of the spring bearing against the bottom 
of the blind bore and the other end thereof bearing against an adjusting 

member (47). 
A door closer according to claim 14 characterised in that the 
adjusting member (47) is a screw member which can be screwed in the 

housing (36). 
A door closer according to at least one of the claims 12 to 15 
characterised in that at its back which is towards the bar the housing 

(36) has a longitudinal groove (49) which extends at least over a part of 
its length and which is constricted at its outside and which receives a 

web portion (50) of the slide bar (12) which is of a double-T-shaped 
configuration in cross-section. 
A door closer according to claim 16 characterised in that the 
housing (36) can be arrested on the slide bar (12) by means of at least 

one clamping screw (55).
