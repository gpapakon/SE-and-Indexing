<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to ships (10) for cooled containers. The ships (10) have containers stacked one above the other in several stacks (12) which are connected via cooling-air ducts (14) to ventilation systems (16). In the prior art, such cooled containers are transported exclusively below the weather and loading deck (18), the ventilation systems being arranged on the rear wall or between the cooling-air ducts. The high costs of manufacture and the relatively complicated loading and unloading operations have proved to be disadvantageous time after time. It is therefore desirable to reduce such costs of manufacture and yet permit quicker loading and unloading of the cooled containers. A higher loading capacity is understandably always worth striving for. These aims are achieved by at least 80% of the ventilation systems (16) being arranged under the weather and loading deck (18) and inside the stowage space (20), while the container stacks (12) are arranged on the weather and loading deck (18) of the ship (10) for cooled containers, which has a hatchless construction.

<CLAIMS>
Refrigerated container ship (10) or system, having a plurality of superimposed 
containers in several stacks (12), which are in each case connected 

by means of cooling air ducts (14) constructed as single or double ducts for 
supply and return air, to a ventilating system (16), and an exposed/cargo deck 

(18) and a hold (20) located below it, characterized in that at least 80% of 
the ventilating system (16) are located below the lowered exposed/cargo deck 

(18) and within the underlying hold (20), whilst the container stacks (12) are 
located on the exposed/cargo deck (18) of the refrigerated container ship (10), 

which has a hatch-free structure. 
Refrigerated container ship according to claim 1, characterized in that all 
the ventilating systems (16) are located below the exposed/cargo deck (18) 

and within the hold (20). 
Refrigerated container ship according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the exposed/cargo deck (18) is lower as compared with conventional refrigerated 

container ships. 
Refrigerated container ship according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that six container stacks (12) are successively 

arranged in its longitudinal direction and in at least four stacks (12) at 
least five containers are superimposed. 
Refrigerated container ship according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that for collecting entering water, inclined collecting 

surfaces (22) are provided below the exposed/cargo deck (18) and which communicate 
with ducts (24), which lead off the water in bilge-free manner or by 

means of bilge pumps (26). 
Refrigerated container ship according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the bilge pumps (26) are located in the vicinity of the ship's bottom.
