<DESCRIPTION>
 MODULATION OF THROMBOSPONDIN-CD36 INTERACTIONSThis application relates to thrombospondin and the receptor therefor, known as CD36, GPIIIb or GPIV, and to ligands and methods which can be used to either augment or inhibit interactions between thrombospondin and the receptor. This application also relates to platelets and various cells bearing thrombospondin receptors.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe specific binding of adhesive proteins to cell surface receptors or to extracellular matrices is an essential element of multiple cell adhesion phenomena such as tissue development, the immune response, vascular hemostasis and inflammation. A number of adhesive proteins, which may be pleiotropic and show significant functional redundancy, are involved in such processes.One important mechanism in the generation of adhesion specificity is the induction of a high-affinity binding state in the cell surface receptor following cell stimulation. The best characterized examples are induction of fibrinogen-binding function in the απbβ3 (GPIIb-IIIa) integrin on platelets [Phillips et al, Cell 65:359 (1991); Du et al, Cell 65:409 (1991)] and the capacity for ICAM-1 binding by LFA-1 on T cells [Dustin et al, Nature 341 :619 (1989)].There is now evidence that cell adhesion can involve complex conformational changes in the cell surface receptor induced by the ligand. For example, binding of the recognition sequences Arg-Gly-Asp and the gamma carboxyl terminal dodecapeptide of fibrinogen to the αilbβ3 integrin induces conformational changes in this receptor, generating a high-affinity fibrinogen-binding state. 

 Thrombospondin (TSP) is a multi-domain adhesive macromolecule that interacts with a number of proteins, including fibrinogen, fibronectin and collagen [Leung et al, J. Clin. Invest. 70:542 (1982); Lahav et al, Cell 31 :253 (1982)]. TSP is a major platelet α granule protein and is released and expressed on activated platelet surfaces [Phillips et al, J. Biol Chem.255 :U629 (1980)]. By interacting with fibrinogen, TSP serves to reinforce platelet-platelet cohesion and to stabilize platelet aggregates [Leung, /. Clin. Invest. 74:1764 (1984)].TSP is also synthesized by a variety of cell types and is incorporated into cell matrices, where it may modulate cell adhesion, mobility and growth. TSP also supports adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-intected erythrocytes and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria [Roberts et al, Nature 318:64 (1985); Howard et al, Blood 74:2603 (1989)].CD36 [also known as
