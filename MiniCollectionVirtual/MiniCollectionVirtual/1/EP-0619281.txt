<ABSTRACT>
A crystalline ceramic fiber suitable for reinforcing 
a formed ceramic body is produced by crystallizing an 

amorphous ceramic fiber composed of silicon and nitrogen by 
heat treatment within non-oxide ceramic powder in an inert 

gas atmosphere. The amorphous ceramic fiber is produced by 
thermally decomposing a pre-ceramic fiber produced by melting 

and spinning polysilazane. The amorphous ceramic fiber is 
mainly composed of silicon, nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen, and 

generally has a composition of 40 to 60 weight % Si, 
5 to 40 weight % N, 20 weight % or lower C, and 50 

weight % or lower O.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crystalline ceramic
fiber and a method of manufacturing such a crystalline
ceramic fiber, and more particularly to a ceramic fiber suitable
for use as a reinforcing material for a formed body of
non-oxide ceramic such as silicon nitride or the like and a
method of manufacturing such a ceramic fiber.Sintered ceramic bodies are generally manufactured
by forming ceramic powder into a certain shape, known as a
green body, and then firing the green body. Since a ceramic
material cannot easily be shaped once it is fired, it is
formed into a desired shape before it is fired.A formed ceramic body may be produced by any of
various known processes. For example, a ceramic material may
be pressed into a desired shape by a press or injection-molded
into a desired shape by an injection molding machine.
A ceramic slurry may be molded by a gypsum mold according to
slip casting. Furthermore, a ceramic material may be pressed
into a desired shape by a rubber press according to cold
static hydraulic press. In order to produce a formed ceramic
body having a small wall thickness or a complex shape, it is
preferable to shape a ceramic slurry or a mixture of ceramic
slurry and resin by slip casting, injection molding, or a
process using a doctor blade.In the slip casting process, a ceramic powder is
dispersed in water, and the resultant slurry is put into a
gypsum mold. The gypsum mold then absorbs and passes the water
from the slurry, thereby producing a formed green body
which is solidified.According to the slip casting process, however,
even if a binder or the like is mixed in such a ceramic powder,
since the binding force between ceramic particles is not
necessarily large, the mechanical strength of the formed body
is not so large, and the formed body tends to be broken. 
When the ceramic slurry is dehydrated and dried in the gypsum
mold, the formed body shrinks and hence is liable to crack.
Therefore, it has been difficult to manufacture formed ceramic
bodies of a small wall thickness or a complex shape
without breakage or cracking.In an attempt to solve the problem of breakage or
cracking of formed ceramic bodies, it has been proposed to
reinforce a formed ceramic body of silicon nitride with ceramic
fibers that are produced by melting and spinning
polysilazane (see, for example, Japanese laid-open patent
publication No. 4-238874). It has been found, however, that
a final sintered ceramic body reinforced with amorphous ceramic
fibers produced by such a known process is apt to suffer
