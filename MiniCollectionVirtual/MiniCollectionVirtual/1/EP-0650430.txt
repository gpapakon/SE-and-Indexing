<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a control device for a vehicle propulsion drive comprising two hydrostatic transmissions (3, 4) with adjustable reduction ratios, each transmission comprising a hydraulic pump (12, 13) and a hydraulic motor (14, 15). The transmissions are connected up to drive two vehicle-track assemblies (18, 19). Each transmission has an adjustment device (30, 24; 31, 25) controlled by control signals (vl, vr) to adjust the reduction ratio, with a control section including target-value setting (5) and signal-processing (42, 43) facilities. The target-value setting facility sets reduction-ratio target values for each hydrostatic transmission, using for each a movable control lever (36, 37), and generates target-value signals (sl, sr) while the signal-processing facility (42, 43) processes the target-value signals to give control signals and outputs these control signals. In order to avoid spurious changes in vehicle speed, the signal-processing facility is designed to generate a min./max. window from the target-value signals (sl, sr) in accordance with the relationships: min. = minimum (sl, sr) and max. = maximum (sl, sr), and to determine the control signals (vl, vr) to be output in accordance with the equations: vl = vm + (sl + sr) and vr = vm + (sr - sl) when the means value vm = (vl + vr)/2 of the control signals (vl, vr) determined in a preceding signal-processing step lies within the min./max. window, or to correct the control signals (vl, vr) determined in a preceding signal-processing step in order to determine the control signals (vl, vr) to be output in accordance with the equations: vm
<
min.: vl = vl + (min.-vm), vr = vr + (min.-vm), vm = min.; vm
>
max.: vl = vl - (vm - max.), vr = vr - (vm - max.), vm - max., when the mean value (vm) of the control signals (vl, vr) determined in the preceding signal-processing step lies outside the min./max. window.
