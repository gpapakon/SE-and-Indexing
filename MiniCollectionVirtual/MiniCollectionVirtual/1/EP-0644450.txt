<ABSTRACT>
A projection-type image display apparatus 
including a display means (61) for forming a display 

image, the display means comprising a non-luminescent 
display panel (120) and a microlens array (110) 

disposed on the light-incidence side of the display 
panel. The display panel and the microlens array are 

combined with each other by means of an adhesive made 
of a transparent material and containing spacers (132) 

which ensure the uniformity of the thickness of the 
adhesive layer (130). The arrangement causes the 

microlenses (114) to accurately focus light on the 
display elements of the panel and provides a bright 

image having improved contrast.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image display apparatus
of the projection type.In recent years, for the purpose of attaining a
relatively large display of images with a compact,
lightweight display apparatus, projection-type image
display apparatuses that project the image on a screen
have been used which employ a non-luminescent display
panel of the transmission type to form the image by
projecting light on the display panel from a light
source behind the display panel.The non-luminescent display panel does not emit
light itself, but rather its transmittance is changed
by a driving signal and the image is displayed by
modulating the strength of the light from a light
source provided separately. Examples of non-luminescent
display panels are liquid crystal display panels,
electrochromic display panels, and transmissive-type
ceramic panels (e.g., display panels using lead
lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) in display
elements). In particular, liquid crystal display
panels have been widely used in portable televisions,
word processors, etc.In these display panels, the smallest display
units, referred to as picture elements, are arranged
in a regular pattern and the image is displayed by the
application of independent driving voltages to each
picture element. The methods used to apply
independent driving voltages to each picture element
include the simple-matrix drive system and the active-matrix
drive system. For the purpose of obtaining a display of colour
images, a three-panel system is used which produces
the colour image by superposing monochrome images
which are formed by three display panels corresponding
to the three primary colours (i.e., red, green, and
blue), or a one-panel system is used which performs a
colour display by arranging three kinds of colour
filters corresponding to the three primary colours in
a mosaic or striped pattern (abbreviated to a colour
filter below) so as to face the respective picture
elements of a display panel.In the three-panel system, it is difficult to
produce a compact, lightweight image display apparatus
because of the need for both the three display panels
and an optical system for superposing the three monochrome
images corresponding to the three primary colours.On the other hand, it is relatively simple to
produce a compact, lightweight image display apparatus
and attain lower production costs with the one-panel
system. However, in order to obtain a resolution
equal to that of the three-panel system when
colorizing the image with the one-panel system, three
times as
