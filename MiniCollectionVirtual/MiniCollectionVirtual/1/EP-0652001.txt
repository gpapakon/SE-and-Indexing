<ABSTRACT>
A method of treating peri-menopausal syndrome 
comprising administering to a human in need of treatment 

an effective amount of a compound having the formula 

   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


or 

wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine and piperidino; or a pharmaceutically 
acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The terms peri-menopausal refers to that time in 
a women's life between pre-menopause (the reproductive 
years) and post-menopause. This time period is usually 
between the ages of 40-60, but more often several years on 
either side of 50 years of age. This period is 
characterized by a rapid change in the hormonal balance in 
a woman. Although many different hormones are subject to 
rapid fluctuation during this time, the most notable are 
sex related hormones and in particular estrogens and to a 
lesser extent progestins. The cause of this fluctuation is 
the natural and time dependent cessation of ovian function. 
The hallmark of the ending of the peri-menopausal period 
and the beginning of the post-menopausal period is the 
cessation of ovian function or its inability to regulate 
the previously normal ovulation cycle in the woman. This 
cessation of function is clinically marked by the cessation 
of mensus of a period of one year or more. The time period 
over which this cessation of ovian function persists, i.e., 
the peri-menopausal time, is usually not a sudden or rapid 
event. The peri-menopausal state can last from a few 
months to more typically a year or more. As mentioned before the peri-menopause is marked by 
fluctuations in the woman's hormonal composition, and these 
fluctuations are marked with many sequellae. Sometimes 
these sequellae pass without undo problems for the woman; 
however, they are often a source of moderate to severe 
discomfort and concern and are occasionally the source of 
pathological or even life-threatening events. It is these sequellae in the peri-menopause time which 
define the syndrome. A list of common, through highly 
idiosyncratic, sequellae resulting from entering the peri-menopause 
are: Hot flashes and sweats, atrophic vaginitis, 
headache, dizziness, lack of concentration, irritability, 
loss of libido, joint pain, sleeplessness, apathy,  
 
lassitude, muscular weakness, and palpitations. ("The 
Menopause", Ed. R.J. Beard, University of Park Press, 1976, 
Chapter 11). In addition, there has been described a 
"menopausal or peri-menopausal syndrome" marked with 
depression. Although there is some controversy as to 
whether this is a true psychiatric syndrome or not, the 
peri-menopause is a contributing factor. ("Harrison's 
principles of Internal Medicine", Ed. K.J. Isselbacher, etal., 9th ed., McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1980 pp. 1782-1783). 
In extreme cases, some of these sequellae in some women are 
pathological (such as fluid retention and imbalance)
