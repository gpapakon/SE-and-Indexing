<ABSTRACT>
On a network, a list of optimal printer units for printing output of a job located 
on a data processing system is provided to the data processing system. A request 

for a list of optimal printer units is made at the data processing system 
upon the initiation of a print command. Printer units on the network are 

ranked relative to each other based on proximity to a specified location on the 
network, relative speed in which the output of the job can be printed, and 

compatibility of printer units with the output of the job. A specified number 
of top ranked printer units are displayed on the data processing system as optimal 

units. A selection of a printer unit is received and the output of the job 
is transmitted to the selected printer unit for printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses for routing 
printing jobs of a computer on a data processing system network. Data processing systems networks often have interconnected computers 
and printers located across the network. In a large network, computers and 
printers may be distributed between several buildings on several floors of each 
building, and in several rooms on each floor of a building. Each computer may 
be located closely proximate to some printers, intermediately proximate to 
other printers, and remote from still other printers. For example, a computer 
may be located in an office on the same floor as rooms in which printers are 
located. The same computer may be located on a different floor from other 
printers located in the same building. Still other printers may be located in 
different buildings than the building in which the computer is located. The 
computer can access all of these printers through the network. Users of computers on a network having a file to print frequently desire to 
have the file printed quickly at a location near their computer. Often, however, 
upon sending the file to a nearby printer, the user may find that several 
other printing jobs are already queued at that printer and that the file will take 
a long time to print. The computer user has the option of waiting for the file 
to print at that printer or searching for a different printer. If the computer user is in a hurry to print the file the user typically looks 
for the shortest current print queue at other nearby printers capable of printing 
the file's output datastream. This task entails the user searching through 
routing and hardware statistics for each printer to find the most available local 
printer. However, in order to perform such a search, the user must know the 
names and locations of all the nearby printers. Typically, the printer names are 
long and difficult to remember, rendering the search more troublesome. Even 
if the printer names and locations are known, the manual search for a readily 
available printer is cumbersome and can take much time.  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and 
apparatus for automatically determining and displaying a list of the closest 
networked printers to a computer on a network, which printers have the 
shortest waiting times and fastest print completion estimates for a file to be 
printed from the computer. A method of and network for providing a selection of optimal printing 
units from a plurality

<CLAIMS>
A method of providing a selection of optimal printing units from a plurality 
of printing units, said plurality of printing units being interconnected in a network 

with a data processing system, comprising the steps of: 

a) determining a location of said data processing system; 
b) determining a relative proximity of each of said printing units to said 
location of said data processing system; 
c) for each of said printing units, determining a projected time of completion 
for printing a job; 
d) providing to an interface on said network a list of said printing units 
for printing said job, said list comprising said determined relative proximity 

and said determined time for printing said job for each printing unit. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of determining a projected time 
of completion for printing further comprises the steps of: 


a) determining a rate of printing for each of said printing units; 
b) determining a time required to complete printing of a queue of existing 
jobs at each of said printing units; 
c) determining said projected time of completion for providing for each 
of said printing units from said respective rate of printing and from said respective 

time required to complete printing of said queue. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, further comprising the step of, before providing 
said list to said interface, ranking said printing units according to predetermined 

criteria. 
The method of claim 3 wherein said step of ranking said printing units 
according to said predetermined criteria further comprises the step of ranking 

said printing units according to said determined proximities of said printing 
units.

list, sending said job to one of said printing units that is selected by a user for 

printing. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of, after determining 
said location of said data processing system, determining which printing units 

of said plurality of printing units are capable of printing said job located on a 
data processing system. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said step of determining a location of said 
data processing system further comprises the step of determining said location 

of said data processing system that originates said job.
