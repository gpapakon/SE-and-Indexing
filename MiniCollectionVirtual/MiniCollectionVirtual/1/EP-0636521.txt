webbing length increasing device (32) which is folded over and 

sewn together along a transverse direction of the webbing, 
and when a load applied between a vehicle occupant and the 

webbing length increasing device exceeds a sewing strength 
of the webbing length increasing device, stitching (A11-A13,A21-A26) 

of the 
webbing length increasing device (32) comes undone, the webbing 

length increasing device having at least a first sewn-together 
portion (A11-A13) and a second sewn-together portion (A21-A26), the 

second sewn-together portion (A21-A26) being provided at a webbing

having a sewing strength which is smaller than a sewing 
strength of the first sewn-together portion. Load applied 

between the vehicle occupant and the webbing (12), when a length

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a webbing for
restraining a vehicle occupant which is used in a seat
belt device of a vehicle according to the preamble of
claim 1.In a three-point seat belt device, while a webbing
which is inserted through a shoulder anchor is pulled
out from a take-up device, a tongue plate, through which
a portion of the webbing is inserted, is engaged with a
buckle which is fixed to the vehicle body or to a seat. In
this way, the webbing forms a lap webbing portion,
which contacts the lap portion of the vehicle occupant,
and a shoulder webbing portion, which contacts the
vehicle occupant from the chest to the shoulder.At ordinary times, the webbing can be pulled out
from the take-up device. However, when the vehicle
suddenly decelerates, pulling-out of the webbing from
the take-up device is prevented, the vehicle occupant is
restrained so as to not move-inertially toward the front of
the vehicle, and the vehicle occupant can be protected.It is preferable to provide a means, such as that
described hereinafter, so that-the vehicle occupant is
not subject to excessive pressure at this time.A portion of the webbing is folded over along the
transverse direction thereof and is sewn together so as
to form a loop. When the vehicle occupant is restrained,
when the tensile force applied to the webbing increases
and reaches a predetermined value, the stitching
comes undone. In this way, the length of the webbing
can be increased by the length by which the loop
becomes linear. Inertial movement of the vehicle occupant
by an amount, which corresponds to the amount by
which the length of the webbing is increased, is allowed,
so that the pressure applied to the vehicle occupant is
suppressed. When the loop becomes linear, from then
on, inertial movement of the vehicle occupant is
restricted.However, immediately after the stitching of the webbing
comes undone, the load applied between the vehicle
occupant and the webbing is reduced.When the load suddenly drops to zero or to a low
load which is near zero, vibrations are generated in the
webbing, which results in deterioration of the pressure
suppressing function thereof.Accordingly, it is necessary to suppress a sudden
reduction in load.GB-A-1,447,740 discloses a webbing for restraining
a vehicle occupant, according to the preamble of claim
1, including a webbing length increasing device which is
folded over and sewn together along a transverse direction
of said webbing, and when a load applied between 
a vehicle occupant and said webbing length

<CLAIMS>
A webbing (12) for restraining a vehicle occupant (26)
comprising:

a webbing length increasing device (32) which is folded
over and sewn together along a transverse direction of

said webbing (12) and when a load (F) applied between a
vehicle occupant (26) and said webbing length increasing

device (32) exceeds a sewing strength of said webbing
length increasing device (32) stitching (38) of said

webbing length increasing device (32) comes undone, said
webbing length increasing device (32) having at least a

first sewn-together portion (A1, B1, C1, D1, E1) and a
second sewn-together portion (A2, B2, B3, C2-C7, D2, D3,

E2, E3), said second sewn-together portion being provided
