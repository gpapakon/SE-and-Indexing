<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for the determination of 
urinary protein and creatinine in a single reaction 

vessel using a continuous process. The method involves 
adjusting the pH to a level suitable for carrying out 

an immuno assay for the protein and making such a 
determination by an immuno agglutination technique. 

Raising the pH to a level suitable for determining the 
creatinine quickly dissipates the cloudiness caused by 

the agglutination reaction, so that the creatinine 
determination can be carried out withou
t delay.

<DESCRIPTION>
Human serum albumin (HSA), one of the proteins
measurable in urine, has clinical significance for
detecting the early stages of nephropathy, i.e. an
abnormal state of the kidney. A high percentage of
individuals suffering from insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus (IDDM) and non-insulin dependent diabetes
mellitus (NIDDM) eventually excrete HSA at levels above
the upper end of the normal population. This stage of
"microalbuminuria" becomes progressively worse and
leads to nephropathy. Since the kidney damage at the
stage of microalbuminuria can be controlled or reversed
by administering appropriate therapy, it is well
recognized that measuring microalbuminuria is part of
the comprehensive care of IDDM and NIDDM.Other urine born proteins, e.g. IgG, alpha-1-micro-globulin,
Bence-Jones protein and N-acetyl-b-D-glucosaminidase,
are useful as markers to detect and differentiate
prerenal, glomerular and postrenal forms of
proteinuria. Proteinuria, which is indicated if the
protein concentration in urine is greater than 30
mg/dL, is the common symptom for a variety of different 
kidney diseases. Accordingly, there is a need on the
part of nephrologists, diabetologists and cardiologists
for test methods that are sensitive, specific and
quantitative for the determination of these proteins in
urine.In order to increase the sensitivity and specificity
of urinary protein assays and minimize the
problem of high urine flow rate resulting in urine
dilution, protein/creatinine ratios are used in urine
protein assay results to normalize the urine concentration.
Typical urinary protein analyses involve
immunoassays such as radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay,
latex assisted immunoassay and immunoturbidimetric
assay. Common creatinine assays, such as the alkaline
Jaffe and Benedict-Behre methods, are run at a high pH,
typically in the range of from 11.5 to 12.5. The
common practice in present day clinical laboratories is
to run the protein and creatinine assays separately,
and then combine the values obtained from these assays
to generate the protein creatinine ratio. Since
patients with high urine flow rates would have artificially
low protein values because of the urine's
dilution and since creatinine is a good marker for the
dilution of urine, using the protein/creatinine ratio,
therefore, eliminates the problem of urine dilution and
gives a more accurate reflection of the true protein
excretion rate.In Clin. Chem. 32/8, 1544-1548 (1986); Watts et al
discuss four immunochemical methods (radioimmunoassay,

<CLAIMS>
A method for the determination of protein and creatinine in aqueous
solution in a single reaction vessel (10) which comprises the steps of:


a) providing a reaction vessel having a substantially horizontal axis of
rotation (10) and an analytical reagent channel (23) containing first

(24) and second (34) reaction zones said first reaction zone (23) incorporated
with a dry immunoreagent specific for the protein (28)

and said second reaction zone (34) incorporated with a dry basic
reagent (32b) capable of raising the pH of a reaction fluid introduced

into the reaction channel (23) to a level suitable for creatinine
determination;
b) introducing a sample of aqueous fluid suspected of containing protein
and creatinine and a reaction fluid (21) buffered to a pH suitable

for the determination of the protein concentration
by immunoturbidometric means into the reaction

vessel (10) and bringing it into contact with the dried immunoreagent
(28) to thereby dissolve the immunoreagent and cause

an increase in the turbidity of the reaction fluid by interaction of the
immunoreagent and the protein;
c) determining the concentration of the protein based on the change in
turbidity as a function of time;
d) bringing the reaction fluid (21) and a reagent for the determination
of creatinine (32a) into contact with the dry basic reagent (32b) in

the second reaction zone (34) to thereby dissolve the basic reagent
and raise the pH of the reaction fluid to the level necessary for the

colorimetric determination of creatinine; and
e) determining the concentration of creatinine in the fluid sample by
spectrophotometric means.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the pH is adjusted to a level of from 7
to 9 before the immunoassay is carried out.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the pH is adjusted to a level of from
11.5 to 12.5 before the creatinine assay is carried out.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the reagent for the colorimetric determination
of creatinine is picric acid or 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the aqueous solvent is urine.
The method of Claim 1 wherein the immuno assay is of the agglutination
type. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein the protein concentration is first determined
at a suitable pH and then the pH is raised to a level suitable for

the determination of creatinine.
The method of Claim 7 wherein the determination of creatinine is initiated
within about 30 minutes from the time the pH is raised.
