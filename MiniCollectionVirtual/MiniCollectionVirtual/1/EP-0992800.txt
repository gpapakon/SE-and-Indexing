<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for measuring the resonance frequency of an electric
circuit with low disturbance and high accuracy is disclosed. An electrooptic crystal

(21), whose refractive index changes according to the strength of an applied electric
field, is used as a sensor, and a frequency-sweep electromagnetic wave is applied to a

resonance section of an electric circuit from an external device. The induced current
flowing the resonance section generates an electric field, which is detected by

measuring the refractive index of the electrooptic crystal in the form of the relevant
light intensity. The resonance frequency is determined based on the maximum

electric field strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for measuring the
resonance frequency of an electric circuit with no undesirable influences or
disturbances on the circuit. According to the measurement of the present invention,
the resonance frequency, an important parameter for evaluating the circuit, can be
determined with low disturbance and high accuracy, so that the present invention
greatly contributes to the information/communication and electronics industries.This application is based on Patent Applications No. Hei 10-287736 filed in
Japan.Generally, a resonance circuit of an electric circuit is designed based on
calculated results of the reactance and capacitance of the circuit. However, in most
cases, the practical resonance frequency is different from the design value due to the
dispersion of characteristics of each element included in the circuit, or to floating
capacitance.Conventionally, an electrically-systemized method has been employed for
measuring the resonance frequency, in which a frequency-sweep electromagnetic wave
is applied to the resonance section in the target electric circuit, and related reflection or
the electric field induced in the resonance section is then measured using a coil.
Therefore, the measuring apparatus electrically influences the measured section, and
the measured frequency may be different from the real value. US 4 394 617 discloses a probe for
measuring the resonance frequency of a resonant circuit
by coupling a sweeping waveform of radio frequency
energy to the resonant circuit and measuring the
response with a radio frequency energy probe.WO 96/00905 describes an electro-optic
sampling probe for the measurement of electric and/or
magnetic field components. In consideration of these circumstances, the present invention has an objective
to provide a method and apparatus for measuring the resonance frequency of an electric
circuit with low disturbance and high accuracy.Therefore, the present invention provides a method of measuring the
resonance frequency of an electric circuit having a resonance section, the method using
an electrooptic crystal, whose refractive index changes according to the strength of an
applied electric field, as a sensor for detecting a change of an electric field, and the
method comprising the steps of:
applying a frequency-sweep electromagnetic wave to the resonance section of
the electric circuit from an external device, so as to induce a current flowing in the
resonance section;measuring a change of the refractive index of
