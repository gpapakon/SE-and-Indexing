<ABSTRACT>
A pile coupling for prefabricated pile elements (1, 1') 
made of concrete, each comprising, at the end to be coupled, a 

cast-in metal sleeve (2, 2'), each sleeve (2, 2') being of a 
wavy design and having a length of at least one complete wave 

period (a). The wave form (3) at the location of the wave 
crest on the end face (4, 4') of the pile element (1, 1') is 

extended over a certain distance (x), such that when the end 
faces (4, 4') butt on each other, the distance between the 

wave troughs (14, 14') located on both sides of the joint face 
is greater than the wave period (a). Two half clamping rings 

(6), provided with a corresponding, regular wave profile (3) 
and having a length of at least two wave periods (a), are 

clamped around the metal sleeves (2, 2'), the arrangement 
being such that the end faces (4, 4') of the pile elements (1, 

1') are pressed against each other with pretension.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pile coupling for 
prefabricated pile elements made of concrete, each comprising, 
at the end to be coupled, a cast-in metal sleeve, which metal 
sleeves are interconnectable. For providing foundation piles in the ground, 
prefabricated pile elements of high-grade concrete can be 
used, such as for instance disclosed in DE-OS 21.20.691. For 
reasons of manufacture and transport, the length of these 
prefabricated pile elements is limited to approximately 20-25 
m. If the bearing ground layers are located at a greater depth 
below the ground level than the length of these conventional, 
prefabricated pile elements, these pile elements must be 
coupled in any way so as to form a pile element of a 
sufficient length. A pile coupling of the above-described type is known from 
practice. When a first prefabricated pile element has been 
driven into the ground for the larger part, a second pile 
element is coupled thereto by welding together the metal 
sleeves which are cast in at the ends of the pile elements to 
be coupled. In itself, such a pile coupling is relatively 
cheap; however, welding together the cast-in metal sleeves 
requires quite some time and, moreover, should be carried out 
while the pile-driving rig is stationary, which is undesired 
because it is expensive. Moreover, the thus obtained pile 
coupling has poor resistance to tensile stresses acting on the 
weld, which may give rise to cracks so that the prefabricated  
 
pile elements become loose from each other, which has a very 
adverse impact on the bearing capacity and the reliability of 
the thus formed foundation pile. The object of the invention is to provide a pile 
coupling of the above-described type, wherein these drawbacks 
have been overcome. According to the invention, this object 
is realized by providing a pile coupling in which each sleeve 
is of a wavy design and has the shape of a solid of revolution and has a length of at 
least one complete wave period, the wave form at the location 
of the wave crest on the end face of the pile element being 
extended over a certain distance, such that when the end 
faces butt on each other, the distance between the wave 
troughs located on both sides of the joint face is greater 
than the wave period, and two half clamping rings, provided 
with a corresponding, regular wave profile and having a 
length of at least two wave periods, are clamped around the 
metal sleeves, the distance between the corresponding wave 
troughs in the half clamping rings being
