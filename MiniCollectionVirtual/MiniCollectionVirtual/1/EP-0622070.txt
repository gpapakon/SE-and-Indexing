<CLAIMS>
Powder mixture containing a formaldehyde- and/or
formic acid-releasing compound which has skin-tanning

properties, characterized in that the powder mixture
contains an agent which forms sulphite ions and, if

appropriate, stabilizers.
Mixture according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the compound which has skin-tanning properties is

dihydroxyacetone.
Mixture according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the agent which forms sulphite ions is a hydrogen

sulphite, preferably an alkali metal hydrogen sulphite or
an alkaline earth metal hydrogen sulphite, disulphite,

preferably an alkali metal disulphite, or dithionite.
Mixture according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the agent which forms sulphite ions is sodium

hydrogen sulphite, preferably an alkali metal dithionite,
sodium disulphite or sodium dithionite.
Mixture according to one of Claims 1-4, characterized
in that it contains, as stabilizer, a stearate,

a cellulose derivative or a polymer.
Mixture according to one of Claims 1-5, characterized
in that it contains 45-99% by weight, preferably

80 to 90% by weight, of the compound having skin-tanning
properties, 0.1 to 50% by weight, preferably 1-20% by

weight, of the agent which forms sulphite ions, and 0.1
to 5% by weight of the stabilizer.
Use of a mixture according to one of Claims 1-6
in the manufacture of cosmetic or pharmaceutical

preparations.
Process for manufacturing powder mixtures according 
to Claim 1, characterized in that at least one of the

components, preferably the agent which forms sulphite
ions, is tritur
ated, ground or coated with the
stabilizer.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in
that at least one of the components is triturated or

ground with a conventional lubricant.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in
that at least one of the components is coated with a

conventional film-forming agent or polymer.
