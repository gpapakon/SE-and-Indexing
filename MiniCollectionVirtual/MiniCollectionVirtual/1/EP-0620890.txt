<ABSTRACT>
The invention pertains to a chain drive for bottom-hinged or top-hinged open-out panels, with an oblong box-type housing (5) that can be attached to the frame (1) and that has three chain-guide sections (12a, 12b, 12c) running parallel to longitudinal side of the housing (5), with connecting sections (13, 14), and that has the requisite power chain drive (15, 15a, 22-26, 29) with drive axes (26, 15a) parallel to the chain-drive sections (12a, 12b, 12c). The chain-drive sections are essentially the length (L) of the housing and the fitting height of the drive motor (22).

<CLAIMS>
Chain drive for tiltable wings (2) of windows or doors, having an oblong (L)
casing (5,10;20,21) attachable to a frame, in which casing a chain guide having at

least three guide sections (12a,12b,12c) each in parallel with the side wall of the
casing (5,10;20,21) and having corresponding joining sections (13,14) and a

chain driving gear (29;15) having an axis (28;15a) perpendicular to the face of the
casing are provided, one of the joining sections (14) extending from the driving

gear (15;29) to an outlet opening for the chain (30,7) out of the casing,
characterized in
 that

(a) each of said guide sections (12a,12b,12c) has a length substantially
corresponding to the length (L) of the casing (5,10;20,21);
(b) a drive motor (22) for the driving gear (15;29) having a gear axis (26;16a) in
parallel with the guide sections (12a,12b,12c) is arranged within the

casing (5,10), the height of the casing (5,10;20,21) corresponding to the
overall height of the drive motor (22).
The chain drive according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that all of the joining
sections (13,14) of the chain guide are arranged on the narrow sides of the

casing (5,10;20,21).
The chain drive acccording to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that the gear
axis (26) of the drive motor (22) and a transmission unit (23 to 27) are arranged in

a first plane (35) dividing the casing height in two approximately equal parts and
the guide sections (12a,12b,12c) constitute a continuous chain guide (32) in two

parallel second planes (36,37) lying on both sides of said plane (35).
The chain drive according to claim 3, in which the chain guide sections arranged
above and below said first plane (35) are continuously connected with each other

by an inclined ramp section (39).
The chain drive according to claim 4, 
characterized in
 that the chain guide (32)
extends over at least 1 1/2 loops following the inner periphery of the

casing (5,10;21,20). 
The chain drive according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in
 that the two second
planes (36,37) are arranged at approximately equal distances above and below,

respectively, said first plane (35) containing the longitudinal axis (26) of the motor-transmission
unit (23 to 27).
Chain drive, having a drive motor (22) arranged in an oblong casing being
provided with a chain guide, 
characterized in
 that the gear axis (26,16a) of the
motor (22) extends in parallel to three chain guide sections (12a,12b,12c) in the

casing (5,10;20,21), the guide sections corresponding substantially to the length
of the casing (5,10;20,21) and the overall height of the motor (22) corresponding

substantially to the height of the casing (5,10;20,21).
