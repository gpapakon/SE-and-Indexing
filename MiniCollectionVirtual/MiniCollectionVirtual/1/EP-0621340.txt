<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for the isolation and 
purification of polypeptides expressed in host cells by 

recombinant DNA techniques. A fused polypeptide is 
produced containing a desired polypeptide fused to 

additional amino acids. The additional amino acids 
define a leader sequence having properties exploitable 

in purification, a hinge region, and a cleavage site. 
The hinge region is cysteine-free and has a secondary 

structure which serves to expose the cleavage site to a 
selected endopeptidase. The method of the invention 

involves the production of a fused polypeptide which 
may be efficiently isolated by exploiting the 

properties of the leader sequence, and then efficiently 
cleaved at the cleavage site in an appropriate aqueous 

environment by virtue inter alia of the influence of 
the hinge on the cleavage agent/cleavage site reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the isolation and 
purification of polypeptides produced using genetic 
engineering techniques. More particularly, it 
relates to the design of genetically engineered fused 
polypeptides and the isolation and purification of 
target polypeptides therefrom by cleavage. Advancements in recombinant DNA technology 
permitting foreign genes to be incorporated into 
various cells have made possible the expression of a 
product foreign to the cell. The molecular biology 
governing the expression of recombinant DNA places a 
variety of constraints on the form of polypeptides or 
proteins produced in the host organism. For 
instance, intracellular enzymes will often degrade 
the protein of interest, and it may be difficult to 
separate from other materials expressed by or 
comprising the structural materials of the host 
organism. The development of fusion or hybrid 
polypeptide methodology has facilitated the 
protection, isolation, and purification of 
genetically engineered polypeptides and overcomes 
some of these constraints. Protection from  
 
intracellular degradation can be accomplished by 
fusing a sequence of amino acids to the target 
protein to avoid digestion by enzymes within the 
cell. A fusion product can be engineered to be 
secreted from the host into the growth medium by 
fusing a signal peptide to the target. In addition, 
the hybrid can be designed to facilitate isolation 
and purification if the desired protein is fused to a 
polypeptide having characteristics exploitable in 
purification. The fusion product is prepared by 
engineering the gene coding for the protein of 
interest in reading frame with a DNA sequence of a 
polypeptide other than the protein of interest. For 
instance, DNA specifying a positively charged peptide 
or other molecule can be fused to the DNA encoding 
the target protein, allowing the protein product to 
bind strongly to negatively charged ion-exchange or 
affinity matrices. The production of proteins with fusion 
methodology is also faced with constraints. For 
example, the material fused to the target protein 
must not permanently interfere with the biological 
activity of the target protein, and efficient 
cleavage of the fused material to obtain purified 
target protein can be difficult to achieve. Often 
only some fraction of the fusion protein is properly 
cleaved, and therefore existing methods provide low 
purification efficiency. Furthermore, the cleavage 
agent may cleave at several locations resulting in 
product loss and the
