<ABSTRACT>
A control system (104)/method for a vehicular automated mechanical 
transmission is provided, which will compare input signals indicative of input shaft 

speed (IS) to the product of input signals indicative of output shaft speed 
multiplied by engaged gear ratio (OS*GR) to develop control parameters indicative 

of drivetrain torque magnitude and/or phase requiring a driveline torque 
transducer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicular automatic or partially automatic 
mechanical transmission systems and, in particular, to control systems/methods for 
vehicular fully or partially automated mechanical transmission systems for sensing 
driveline torque phase, magnitude and/or changes in driveline torque magnitude 
for control of the transmission system without the use of driveline torque 
transducers. More particularly, the preferred embodiment of the present invention 
relates to an automated mechanical transmission control system/method which 
enhances shift decisions and/or shift implementation by monitoring the value of 
parameters indicative of input shaft speed (IS), output shaft speed (OS) and 
engaged gear ratio (GR) to determine values indicative of driveline torque phase 
and/or magnitude of driveline torque and/or change in magnitude of driveline 
torque. Fully automatic transmission systems (both for heavy-duty vehicles, such as 
heavy-duty trucks, and for automobiles) that sense throttle openings or positions, 
vehicle speeds, engine speeds, transmission shaft speeds and the like, and 
automatically shift the vehicle transmission in accordance therewith, are well 
known in the prior art. Such fully automatic change gear transmission systems 
include automated transmissions wherein pressurized fluid is utilized to frictionally 
engage one or more members to other members or to a ground to achieve a 
selected gear ratio, as well as automated mechanical transmissions utilizing 
electronic and/or pneumatic logic and actuators to engage and disengage 
mechanical (i.e., positive) clutches to achieve a desired gear ratio. Examples of 
such transmissions may be seen by reference to U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,961,546; 
4,081,065 and 4,361,060. Semi-automatic transmission systems utilizing electronic control units which 
sense throttle position, engine, input shaft, output shaft and/or vehicle speed, and  
 
utilize automatically controlled fuel throttle devices, gear shifting devices and/or 
master clutch operating devices to substantially fully automatically implement 
operator manually selected transmission ratio changes are known in the prior art. 
Examples of such semi-automatic transmission systems may be seen by reference 
to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,425,620; 4,631,679 and 4,648,290. Semi-automatic shift implementation systems/methods for mechanical 
transmission systems for use in vehicles having a manually only controlled engine 
throttle means and/or a manually only controlled master clutch also have been
