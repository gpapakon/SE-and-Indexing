<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to piperidine oligomers, methods for the preparation of piperidine oligomers and compound libraries thereof, and the use of piperidine oligomers as drug substances. The present invention also relates to the use of combinatorial libraries of piperidine oligomers for screening purposes. The oligomers have one of the general formulas (I) or (II). Each of the monomers (piperidine carboxylic acids) are linked via amide bonds. The piperidine monomers may carry substituents, particularly hydroxy, hydroxymethyl, and carboxy substituents. The oligomers may be prepared in libraries (arrays) of compounds especially suitable for screening purposes.

PIPERIDINE OLIGOMERS AND COMBINATORIAL LIBRARIES THEREOFFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to piperidine oligomers, methods for the preparation of piperidine oligomers and libraries thereof, and the use of piperidine oligomers as drug substances. The present invention also relates to the use of combinatorial libraries of piperidine oligomers for screening purposes.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cell surface oligosaccharides play an important, though often little understood, role in cell recognition and adhesion processes (Keilhauer, K. L. et al; Nature 31 6 ( 1985) 728; Hoffman, S. et al; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80 ( 1 983) 5762; Springer, T. A. et al; Nature 346 ( 1 990) 425; and Brandley, B. K. et al; Cell 63 ( 1 990) 861 ), virus (including HIV) infectivity (Brandley, B. K. et al; Cell 63 ( 1 990) 861 ), lymphocyte homing and migration (Montefiori, D. C. et al; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 ( 1 988) 9248 and Yednock, T: A. et al; 104 (1987) 71 3), tumor metastasis (Stoolman, L. M. 56 (1 989) 907; Dennis, J. W. et al; 236 ( 1987) 582; and Benedetto, A. et al; 43 ( 1 989) 1 26) and many other disorders. Synthetic oligosaccharides could potentially be of great value both for study of these phenomena but also as therapeutics. Thus, a synthetic oiigosaccharide could be used to, by binding to a certain complementary oiigosaccharide receptor, block cell adhesion, virus infection etc. and do so with very high specificity.Although this idea is not new, it has been little exploited because oligosaccharides of sufficient size are extremely difficult and laborious to synthesise. Furthermore the oligosaccharides will be susceptible to the glycoside cleaving enzymes present in vivo converting them back into monosaccharides thus reducing their efficiency.Compounds that would resemble the oligosaccharides in shape and polarity, i.e. oiigosaccharide biomimetics, and thus bind to the same receptors but lack the lability to glycosidases would be a powerful analytical and therapeutic tool, provided such compounds were easier to prepare. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONConstruction of the compounds of the general formula I and IIAs mentioned above, oligosaccharides play an important role in a number of biological processes, however, oligosaccharides are first of all difficult to prepare, and secondly susceptible to enzymatic degradation. Thus, the rationale behind the present invention is to provide novel compounds which resemble the spatial configuration of oligosaccharides, but which have superior
