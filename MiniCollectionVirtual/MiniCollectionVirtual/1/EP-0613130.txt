<ABSTRACT>
A novel carbon material is obtained by bending at 
least one carbon atom layer of graphite in at least one 

selected region along either, or both, of lines I and II 
in Fig. 1. The bending can be accomplished by 

scanningly picking the carbon atom layer(s) with a probe 
of an atomic force microscope or another scanning 

microscope. The obtained carbon material has at least 
one round bend having a width of 0.1-10 nm and at least 

one flap region having a triangular, rectangular or 
still differently polygonal shape in plan view. When 

the carbon atom layer(s) is bent with very small radii 
of curvature, a finely striped ridge-and-groove 

structure appears in the round bend. The physical 
properties of the obtained carbon material are uniquely 

determined by the direction(s) of bending, width of each 
bend, shape and size of each flap region and the stripe 

pitch of the ridge-and-groove structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel carbon material,
which is obtained by working graphite on the atomic
level and can have various shapes and uniquely
determined physical properties, and a method of
producing the novel carbon material. This carbon
material has latent possibilities of wide uses in the
next generation industries and particularly in the
microelectronic and microoptoelectronic industries.Well known carbon materials are carbon black,
amorphous carbon, glassy carbon, graphite and diamond.
The uses of carbon black, amorphous carbon and glassy
carbon are limited because these carbon materials have
no definite structure. Graphite has a layer structure
consisting of regularly stacked uniplanar layers of
hexagonally arranged carbon atoms and hence exibits two-dimensional
conductivities. Diamond has a
three-dimensional network structure consisting of
tetrahedrally arranged carbon atoms. Although the
structures and physical properties of graphite and
diamond are well known, it is difficult to utilize these
carbon materials in electronic devices because there is
no method of forming microstructures of graphite or
diamond.A recently discovered carbon material is C60 which
is a spherical assembly of carbon atoms. C60 exhibits
various properties including semiconductivity,
conductivity and superconductivity in accordance with its
electron structures which are attributed to its
symmetries. However, for practical uses of C60 there is 
an unsolved problem that variously desired crystals
cannot easily be produced.A more recent discovery is the formation of carbon
nanotubes, first disclosed in Nature, Vol. 354(1991),
56-58. A carbon nanotube is made up of a plurality of
coaxially nested rolls of graphite sheets each of which
has a thickness of several carbon atom layers. The
outer diameter of a carbon nanotube is only a few to
tens of nanometers, and the length is usually shorter
than 10µm. Carbon nanotubes attracted worldwide
attention in view of the possibilities of using as one-dimensionally
conducting wires or catalysts or in
superreinforced structures. A particularly attractive
feature of a carbon nanotube is that the electrical
property of each of the nested carbon tubes
depends on the tube diameter and the pitch of a helical
arrangement of carbon atom hexagons in the rolled
graphite sheets and is variable from a metallic
conductor to semiconductors with various band gaps.
It is intended to use carbon nanotubes as quantum wires,
but at present practical use encounters some problems.
Carbon nanotubes are
