<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pharmaceutical products.The term "organic nitrates" as used in this specification
refers to pharmacologically active organic nitrate
compounds which relieve, or act as prophylactic against,
angina pectoris.Organic nitrates are dilators of arterial and venous
smooth muscle. The dilation action on the venous system
increases the venous capacity allowing pooling of venous
blood. This in turn reduces the volume of blood returning
to the heart thereby lessening the strains on the heart
muscle by reducing the pressure in the heart chambers
(ventricles). This, in turn, reduces the oxygen
requirements of the heart muscle. The dilation action on
the arterial system is achieved by increasing the volume
of the arterial system with consequent lower resistance to
blood flow. This, in turn, reduces the work that the
heart is required to do. In the coronary arteries (heart)
a transient widening of the arteries (vasodilation)
increases blood circulation to the heart muscle thereby
increasing oxygen availability to the heart muscle.Patients with coronary artery narrowing may suffer from
angina pectoris which is usually brought on by exercise,
emotion or eating. The organic nitrates by virtue of
their action described above relieve the symptoms of
angina pectoris.In more detail, organic nitrates act in two ways -
indirectly and directly.Indirectly: they are smooth muscle relaxants and thus
dilate both arterial and venous blood vessels. At lower 
doses their action is mainly on the venous system
resulting in a decreased right and left ventricular
filling pressure. At lower doses, however, they have
little effect on the systemic (arterial) filling pressure.
At higher doses, the arterial effects are more marked and
decreased systemic resistance is accompanied by a
reduction in blood pressure (Flaherty et al 1976). The
venodilating and arterial effects of nitrates relieve
ischaemia (the cause of angina, pain) by reducing
determinates of myocardial oxygen demand.Directly: they relieve ischaemia by direct action on the
coronary vasculature thereby increasing intercoronary
collateral flow and reversal of coronary artery spasm.One widely used organic nitrate is isosorbide mononitrate
(ISMN) which is an active metabolite of Isosorbide
dinitrate (ISDN). ISMN has a high bioavailability and has
a comparatively long half life (4-5 hours). Thus it is
very suitable for prophylactic angina therapy. This is
particularly so when it is presented as a sustained
release formulation.WO-A-92/01668 describes benzoic
