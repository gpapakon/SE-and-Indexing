<ABSTRACT>
A phosphorescent phosphor according to the present 
invention includes a matrix of formula MAl₂O₄ in which M is 

a metal selected from calcium, strontium and barium, or in 
which M comprises at least two metals selected from 

calcium, strontium, barium and magnesium. The phosphor 
matrix may be doped with europhium as a activator, and 

optionally other rare earth metals as co-activator(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to phosphorescent phosphors, and more particularly to a novel phosphorescent
phosphor which shows excellent photo-resistance required for the phosphorescent phosphor to be utilized both indoors
and outdoors mainly as a night-time display, and which shows extremely long afterglow characteristics.Generally, the afterglow time of a fluorescent substance is short, i.e., the light emitted from the fluorescent substance
decays immediately after it has been removed from the source of excitation. Unlike such a fluorescent substance,
some substances emit light after having absorbed ultraviolet radiation or the like and the afterglow that can be
visually observed continues for a considerable time (ranging from several tens of minutes to several hours) after the
source of stimulus is cut off. Such substances are called phosphorescent phosphors.As phosphorescent phosphors, sulfide phosphorescent phosphors are known. Examples of sulfide phosphorescent
phosphors include CaS : Bi (which emits light of violet blue), CaSrS : Bi (which emits light of blue), ZnS : Cu (which
emits light of green) and ZnCdS : Cu (which emits light of yellow or orange). However, these sulfide phosphorescent
phosphors are chemically unstable and show degraded light resistance, i.e. they have drawbacks that must be solved
for practical use.The most extensively used phosphorescent phosphor among such sulfide phosphorescent phosphors is zinc
sulfide phosphorescent phosphor (ZnS : Cu). However, zinc sulfide phosphorescent phosphor is decomposed by ultraviolet
radiation in the presence of moisture and thus blackens or shows reduced luminance. Therefore, it is difficult
to use this phosphorescent phosphor in applications which require it to be placed outdoors and exposed to direct
sunlight, that is, its use is limited to luminous clocks/watches and instrument dials, evacuation guiding signs or indoor
night-time display.Even when zinc sulfide phosphorescent phosphor is used for a luminous clock, since the afterglow thereof which
allows the time to be visually recognized lasts only from 30 minutes to 2 hours, a radioactive substance must be doped
to the phosphorescent phosphor and a self-luminous paint which keeps emitting light by absorbing an energy of radiation
from radioactive substance must be employed.J. Electrochem. Soc. 115(6), pages 642 to 644 (1968), discloses a
luminescent aluminate activated by europium that shows afterglow
characteristics, but inspite of long persistence of afterglow and excellent
chemical
