<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a driving system for the working parts of a self-propelled press for large cuboid bales which presses agricultural crops to form cuboid bales. This driving system is to require a minimum outlay in terms of production, have favourable efficiency and, in particular, guarantee easy access to the safety device of the disc flywheel (22) in the event of damage. This is achieved if the driven shaft (16) of the engine (14) is arranged transversely to the direction of travel and at the same time parallel to the drive shaft (17) of the main gear (10), on which the disc flywheel (22) is mounted in turn, as a result of which the drive connection between the driven shaft (16) of the engine (14) and the drive shaft (17) of the main gear (10) is to be made by means of a single belt drive (18). The main gear (10) now has only spur-wheel stages (23) which bring about a stepped reduction in the rotational speed from its drive shaft (17) to its output shaft (11).
