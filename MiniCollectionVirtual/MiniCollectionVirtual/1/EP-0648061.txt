unit with a plurality of user sites. The invention 

includes the steps of and circuitry for connecting a 
plurality of line circuits to a cross-connect matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electronics and
more particularly electronic communications systems. Even more
specifically, the invention relates to a method and system for
connecting an optical network unit with a plurality of user
sites that provides remote control features, improved system
hardware characteristics, enhanced connection management
features, and enhanced hardware protection properties. Fiber-in-the-loop (FITL) telecommunications systems use
hundreds and thousands of optical network units (ONUs) to
connect existing copper wire or twisted pair connections in
homes and other user sites to the telephony network.
Installation and maintenance of FITL systems typically require
field technician on-site visits or service calls for functions
such as adding second or additional lines, replacing failed
line circuits, and cutting over new installations at each ONU.
Field technician or craft service calls are generally labor
intensive and expensive, and equipment handling by even the
highest skilled field technicians can shorten the life
expectancy of telecommunications equipment. Consequently,
there is a need for alternative methods to perform the above-described
operations.The ONUs of an FITL system often are installed in hard-to-reach
spots such as on poles, in hand holes, on cable strands,
in muddy development sites, etc. They are sealed, and breaking
their seal for routine functions will tend to reduce their
reliability, introduce moisture and dirt, and require field
technician time to reseal and re-verify the seal. Current
system designs contemplate that ONUs will be deployed in great
numbers (e.g., approximately 1 for every 8 homes or sites)
compared with the higher numbers of sites that conventional 
communications remote terminals service. A failed circuit may
require an immediate response to replace a line unit. This
replacement or repair often occurs during off hours when labor
rates are highest. If a field technician must go to each one
of these sites to install connections, add second lines, or
replace failed line circuits, system operating costs for FITL
systems are likely to be substantially higher than similar
costs for conventional systems. If a method and system existed
that could save operating costs by allowing work to be
scheduled during normal working hours, then such a method and
system would be of great value to those companies responsible
for maintaining and installing FITL telecommunications.
systems.Another issue that FITL systems must address is system
