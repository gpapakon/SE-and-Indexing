<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel graft 
copolymers of shellac and polyalkyleneglycol 
monomethacrylates and their use in water-based 
flexographic, i.e. packaging laminating, inks. The use of shellac in water-based flexographic inks 
is well known. However, such inks have several 
disadvantages, notably marginally acceptable bond 
strength and undesirably high viscosities. Moreover, as 
inks are used, there is a buildup of ink on the press 
cylinders and shellac-based inks are difficult to remove 
from the cylinders, even with alkaline cleaning 
solutions. Acrylic resins on the other hand can be made water-dispersible, 
but are generally incompatible with shellac 
and do not offer the advantages of shellac such as 
adhesion, gloss and printability. Ideally, a copolymer of these two incompatible 
polymers would be very useful for preparing water-based 
inks, but such copolymers have not been produced to date. Polyalkyleneglycol monomethacrylate monomers are 
grafted onto shellac resulting in graft copolymers that 
retain the desirable properties of each component. The 
process for preparing the graft copolymers involves 
reacting the desired polyalkyleneglycol monomethacrylate 
monomer with shellac together with an alkali, 
ammonia or an amine in an alkanol solvent with a free 
radical peroxidic initiator to obtain an alcohol solution  
 
of the graft copolymer. The alkanol solution may then be 
mixed with the desired pigment, binder resin, additional 
alkali, ammonia or amine, additional alkanol and diluted 
with water to the desired tinctorial strength. Alternatively, if it is desired to produce an 
alkanol-free ink, the shellac may be solubilized with 
ammoniacal water to a pH of 8-9 at 50° C and separately 
adding the desired polyalkyleneglycol monomethacrylate 
monomer and a free radical peroxidic initiator such as 
0.25-0.50 wt.% ammonium persulfate. The resultant 
copolymer solution may then be mixed with pigment, binder 
resin, additional alkali, ammonia or amine and diluted 
with water to the desired tinctorial strength to thereby 
produce a water-based ink containing no alkanol. Shellac is the flaked form of purified lac. It 
typically has an acid value of 65-80, a hydroxyl value of 
260-280 and an iodine value of 15-25. It has a melting 
point range of 75-85°C, a relative density of 1.15-1.20 
and a water content of 2-16%. The addition of an alkali, 
ammonia or an amine produces a salt which renders it 
water soluble. For the purposes of the present 
invention, it is desirable that the
