<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention, which consists in the development of a method for digital signal processing for mixing input signals to become output signals under real-time conditions, comprising a parallel bus which can carry a different signal produced by mixing in every time slot and without time slots having to be reserved for input signals, is achieved by the fact that all input signals weighted with coefficients are simultaneously applied during the time slot to a summing field, the output of which forms the bus for the output signal. The field of application of the invention extends to the entire field of digital signal processing, primarily in the processing of large quantities of data within a predetermined time, for example in digital image and sound processing.

<CLAIMS>
A method of digital signal processing, whereby input
signals (IN1, IN2, IN3) are mixed to yield output

signals (OUT1, OUT2, OUT3) and whereby a time slot (i)
on a bus is assigned at least to each output signal

(OUT1, OUT2, OUT3), characterized in that all the input
signals (IN1, IN2, IN3) weighted with coefficients (c1i,

c2i, c3i) are applied simultaneously to a summation
field whose output forms the bus (mix) for the output

signal (OUT).
A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that by
pipelining of the summation field, the time slot (i) in

which the input signals (IN1, IN2, IN3) weighted with
coefficients (c1i, c2i, c3i) are applied to the

summation field is different from the time slot (i)
containing the output signal (OUT) of the summation

field assigned to these input signals (IN1, IN2, IN3).
A method according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterized in
that due to the design of the summation field, there is

a time offset between the individual input signals (IN1,
IN2, IN3) weighted with coefficients (c1i, c2i, c3i) and

assigned to one output signal (OUT).
A method according to Claim 1, 2 and/or 3, characterized
in that the coefficients (c1i, c2i, c3i) for weighting

the input signals (IN1, IN2, IN3) consist of a few
values such as zero or one.
