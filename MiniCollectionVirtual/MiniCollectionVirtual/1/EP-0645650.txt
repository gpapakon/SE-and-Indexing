<ABSTRACT>
Integrated optical polarization converter provided with a channel-type 
waveguide (B) defined by a strip-type structure (S₄) supported by a substrate 

(S) and consisting of a periodic concatenation of two different part strips 
having side walls which are at different angles with the plane of the substrate. 

Preferably, the two part strips then have as cross-sections either a trapezium 
(EFGH) with Δ₁, Δ₂ ≠ 0) and a rectangle (EFGH with Δ₁ = Δ₂ = 0), or both 

of them a right-angled trapezium with oblique sides situated opposite one 
another (EFGH with Δ₁ = 0 and Δ₂ ≠ 0, and EFGH with Δ₁ ≠ 0 and Δ₂ = 0). 
Oblique and vertical side walls on such a strip-type structure supported 
by a substrate are fabricated, in the case of suitable crystal orientation, by 

means of two mutually complementary mask patterns, using etching steps, 
employing wet-chemical and dry etchants respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of the conversion of guided modes of light
waves in integrated optical devices. More in particular, the invention relates to
a polarization converter for the conversion of a fraction of a signal
component, propagating according to a first guided mode, of an optical signal
into a signal component propagating according to a second guided mode, the
first and second modes relating to different polarization modes, comprising a
channel-type waveguide supported by a substrate, in which waveguide a
periodic coupling takes place between the said guided modes of the optical
signal propagating in the waveguide, said waveguide comprising an incoming
wave-guiding section, an intermediary wave-guiding section and an outgoing
wave-guiding section, the intermediary wave-guiding section having a periodic
geometrical structure including a periodic concatenation of, within a period
length, two wave-guiding subsections, provided with different waveguide
profiles mainly determined by strip-type elements.The invention further relates to a method for fabricating a channel-type
waveguide which is supported by a substrate and comprises a concatenation of
wave-guiding sections having alternately a first and a second mutually
different waveguide profile, each defined by a strip-type structure, which
channel-type waveguide can be used as an intermediary waveguide in a passive
polarization converter of the abovementioned type.Reference [1] (see under C. References) discloses such passive
converters, not only for conversions between guided modes having different
polarizations, but also between guided modes having the same polarization. 
The conversion effect is based on symmetry of the coupling planes between
the different successive wave-guiding sections, which are situated, by a
suitable choice of the lengths of the subsections, at such mutual distances that
positive interference is possible between the subfractions, converted in each
coupling plane, of a specific guided mode. For an integrated version of such a
mode converter, the symmetry required of the coupling planes is
accomplished, for example, by differences in width of the different
successive sections, or by successive sections having identical profiles being
joined to one another in an offset manner. Although such discontinuities in a
lateral direction are relatively easy to fabricate, an example provided of a
polarization converter (see Example 1, page 7, lines 37-53) shows that the
conversion efficiencies in the coupling planes are rather
