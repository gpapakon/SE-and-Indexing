<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shuttering for producing round concrete columns. Said shuttering comprises one or more individual shuttering parts (1), which can be assembled together, with the aid of a clamping device (5), to form a dimensionally stable hollow body. In this arrangement, the essential feature is the special arrangement and shape of the teeth (3), responsible for mutual anchorage, of two bearing surfaces (2) which are assigned to one another, this preventing individual shuttering parts (1) from being displaced or twisting with respect to one another. With the aid of closable bores (7), it is possible to permit penetration of projecting reinforcements (8) in the shuttering.
