<ABSTRACT>
A process for making metallized vias in diamond 
substrates is disclosed. The process involves laser-drilling 

a plurality of holes in a CVD diamond substrate and 
depositing tungsten, or a similar refractory metal, in the 

holes by low pressure CVD to provide substantially void-free 
metallized vias. Diamond substrates having metallized 

vias are also disclosed. The structures are useful for 
making multichip modules for high clock rate computers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for making 
metallized vias in diamond substrates and to diamond 
substrates having metallized vias. The metallized diamond 
substrates are useful in making multi-chip modules for high 
clock rate computers. The multi-chip module (MCM) approach for 
achieving very high densities is of particular interest for 
high performance, high clock rate digital systems, where 
signal latency due to interchip interconnect line lengths can 
prove a major limitation. The increasing speeds of digital 
integrated circuits can only be realized in increased system 
speeds if the signal interconnect delays can be 
correspondingly reduced. Such a reduction of signal 
propagation delays is achieved principally through the 
reduction in signal line lengths, such as through dense 
packaging of bare dies in multi-chip modules. However, due 
to the substantial areas of IC dies (typically 1 cm. on a 
side) the interconnect distances between dies in a 2-dimensional 
(2-D) array can be very substantial when the 
number of dies is large. Three-dimensional MCM packaging permits very 
high density packaging. The advantage of a 3-D array is 
dramatic: whereas a given die has only 8 nearest neighbors 
in 2-D, in 3-D (assuming a 1.5 cm. X-Y pitch and a 2.5 mm. Z 
pitch) 116 dies may be reached with essentially the same  
 
signal interconnect length. If these 117 chips had to be 
spread out horizontally, the delay between chips would 
represent a significant performance compromise for system 
clock rates in the 50-100 MHz range, and would virtually 
preclude operation at rates above 250 MHz. With 3-D 
packaging, rates of nearly 1 GHz are theoretically possible. The problem of 3-D architecture is that as IC 
chips are operated at higher frequencies, their power 
dissipations tend to increase proportionally. As the chips 
are packed closely in MCM packaging, the power density 
levels give rise to severe problems with waste heat. Eden, in Proceedings of the InternationalSymposium on Hybrid Microelectronics (1991), has pointed 
out that the key problem in 3-D packaging is achieving the 
vertical interconnects between boards with high density in 
a practical, demountable, reworkable fashion, while at the 
same time getting out of the "cube" (the completed 3-D 
interconnected system) the heat resulting from the 
substantial power dissipation from all of the high speed 
IC's operating in a small volume. If the problems could be 
solved, a 10 cm. by 10 cm. cube computer could provide all 
the logic of a
