<ABSTRACT>
A finder has display means for displaying an 
image, and a finder optical system for observing the 

image therethrough. The spacing between the display 
means and the whole of the finder optical system is 

relatively varied to thereby effect the adjustment of 
the field of view.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a finder for a video
camera or the like, and particularly to a visual axis
detecting finder for detecting a photographer's visual
axis during operation of a camera.Cameras in which a focus position intended by a
photographer is decided by detecting the photographer's
visual axis have been put on sale.A visual axis detecting apparatus is disclosed,
for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No.
61-172,552. According to this publication, the center
of pupil of a photographer's eye and the corneal
reflected image (so-called Parkinje's image) of a light
source for illuminating the eye are detected, and the
direction to which the eye is directed is calculated
from the relative relation between the Parkinje's image
and the center of the pupil to thereby decide the
direction of the visual axis.Also, a finder in which visual axis detection and
adjustment of the field of view of the finder are
combined together is proposed, for example, in Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Application No. 5-188,430.This publication proposes a technique of moving 
some of lenses constituting an eyepiece so as not to
affect visual axis detection in order to prevent any
reduction in the accuracy of visual axis detection in
effecting diopter adjustment.However, moving a part of the eyepiece in
effecting diopter adjustment results in a variation of
the size of the field of view and thus, an object in
the field of view moves. Accordingly, when looking at
a certain object, the visual axis deviates and it is
necessary to detect the visual axis again. If a
person's visual axis smoothly follows the object, it
will be possible to detect the visual axis without so
great a problem, but actually the visual axis may do a
flickering fluctuation or may sometimes look at a quite
different area. Particularly, in a finder of a high
field magnification like an electronic viewfinder (EVF)
in a video camera or the like, if a part of the
eyepiece of the finder is moved, the variation in the
field magnification will become great and the
fluctuation of the visual axis will become great.
Accordingly, in adjusting diopter, being a finder which
suffers little from a variation in the field
magnification and in which the position of the object
does not change is convenient for effecting visual axis
detection. In view of such a problem, it is a first object of
the present invention to provide a finder device which
suffers little from a variation in field magnification
in effecting diopter adjustment. It is a second object
of the

<CLAIMS>
A finder device having a diopter adjustment device for
adjusting a diopter, including


a display means (1) for displaying an image; and
a finder optical system (2, 3; 4, 5, 6, 7; 22, 23, 24, 25; 100) consisting
of various optical elements for observing said image

therethrough,
characterized in that
a spacing between said display means (1) and the totality of
said whole finder optical system (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; 22, 23, 24,

25; 100) consisting of all optical elements is variable for
effecting diopter adjustment, wherein said display means (1) and

said finder optical system (2, 3; 22, 23, 24, 25; 100) satisfy
the following condition:


H/f

 0.37,

where H is the length of said display means (1) in a horizontal
direction and f is the focal length of said finder optical

system (2, 3; 22, 23, 24, 25; 100).
A finder device according to Claim 1, wherein
said finder optical system has a plurality of lenses (2, 3; 22, 23, 24, 25)

and a reflecting member (5) disposed between said lenses
for reflecting light from an eye, and a sensor (7) for

receiving the light reflected from said reflecting
member.
