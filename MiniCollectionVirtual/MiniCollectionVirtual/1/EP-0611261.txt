<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a special alimentary
composition in the form of powder dilutable into
water that is providing a suitable food for all
persons (newborns, children, young and old people)
who do not tolerate milk or soya proteins or lactose.As a matter of fact statistics prove that
a same person in addition to intolerance to cow-milk
proteins, namely whey proteins and casein do
not tolerate even the lactose because of a deficiency,
either temporary or congenital, of lactase, that
is the enzyme able to split the lactose into glucose
and galactose and therefore to make it assimilable
by the organism, according the feeding of
these persons necessarily comprises lactose of 
cowmilk protein free products. In these products
lactose is substituted with other carbohydrates
like glucose or maltodextrins for newborns or with
maltodextrins and starch for adults; the milk
proteins on the contrary were replaced until now
by alternative proteins like soya derived or hydrolized
milk proteins. However these foods in addition
to a bad taste that makes the same difficult
to use, especially for prolunged administration
as normally happens, cause several troubles either
as regards of absorption of various nourishing
components or for the outbreak of side effects.The most important drawbacks are:
allergy to the above mentioned alternative proteins;high osmotic load;metabolic acidosis;not appetising foods.From what set forth it possible to deduce
that, at present, no product is available to satisfy
the nourishing needs of persons, newborns
or adults having a lack of lactose or intolerance
to milk proteins which product could provide all
nourishing components in suitable amounts and
without causing indesirable side effects.Patent document WO 91/01647 discloses a hypoallergenic nutritional formula comprising meat selected for
its low allergenicity, together with lipids and carbohydrate additives, and a vitamin and mineral content.Particularly for newborns, the food of the
invention can replace, in several cases, the troublesome
parenteral feeding because it can be easily
administered by gavage (in addition to feeding
bottle).The composition of the invention substitutes
all the products used until now and has a formula
that allows the feeding of subjects either with  
deficit of lactose or with intolerance to milk
or soya proteins for long periods and without
any indesirable side effects.The invention provides a hypoallergenic food
in which the proteins are constituted by hydrolized
meat of a well particular type (white
