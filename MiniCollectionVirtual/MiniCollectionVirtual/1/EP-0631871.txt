<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet apparatus for use with discharge openings 
for respectively discharging yellow ink, cyan ink, magenta ink 

and black ink comprises a capping member (20,21) for capping all of 
the discharge openings collectively and having a suction 

opening (20a) proximate to the black ink discharge openings, or at 
least displaced from the yellow ink discharge openings during 

capping by the capping member (20,21), when the discharge openings 
are capped, suction is applied to the capping member through 

the suction opening (20a) to draw ink from all of the discharge 
openings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet apparatus
for discharging ink from a discharge opening, and more
particularly to a recovery device
combined with an ink-jet head
for an ink jet apparatus for
recovering or for maintaining a good ink-discharging condition.An ink jet apparatus discharges ink to print or to
record images, characters or the like on a recording member
such as paper, a thin plastic film, textile or the like according to
information signals. The ink jet apparatus can function as a
printer, a copying machine, a facsimile or an output terminal of
an electronic machine such as a work station, a computer, a
word processor or the like. The ink jet apparatus can be
applied easily to color and half-tone (gray-scale) printing.In such ink jet apparatus, recovery means is usually
provided to recover or to maintain a good ink-discharging
condition, for example, to prevent ink discharge openings from
being clogged by extraneous matter such as viscous ink, dust
and the like. This recovery means is located at a certain
position in the ink jet apparatus, for example, a home position 
of a carriage for carrying an ink jet head, which is in a range of
the movement of the carriage, but out of an area where the ink
jet head performs recording. The recovery means has a cap
usually made of gas-impermeable elastic material for covering
and closing tightly the discharge openings of the ink jet head
from the atmosphere, and a suction pump connected to the cap
through a suction tube for performing suction recovery by
applying negative pressure to the discharge openings while
capping by the cap.As described in United States Patent Nos. 4,492,969,
4,506,277, 4,510,510 and 5,086,305, a color ink jet apparatus
has plural caps and/or plural suction tubes for the different
colors of ink. This is mainly because, if only one cap is
provided to cap all discharge openings of color ink, there is a
possibility that different color inks mix with one another in the
cap and the mixed ink adheres on a surface of the discharge
openings or flows backward into the discharge openings to
disturb the tone on a recording member.On the other hand, plural caps lead to greater cost for
the structure, for the mechanism and for the control system of
the ink jet apparatus because the number of parts and the
complexity of the operation of the apparatus cannot help
increasing. Moreover, such an arrangement makes it difficult to
decrease the size of the apparatus. EP-A-0-509 687 discloses a priming apparatus wherein multi-color

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a recovery device and an ink jet head for
use with an ink jet apparatus comprising:


a capping member (20) for capping all discharge openings
of the ink jet recording head collectively, said discharge

openings being provided for respectively discharging yellow
ink (2Y), cyan ink (2C), magenta ink (2M) and black ink (2B),

said capping member has a suction opening (20a), and
suction means (23) for applying suction to said suction
opening to draw ink from said discharge openings,
characterized in that

said suction opening (20a) is disposed in
said capping member at a location that during capping lies in

the range from the edge of said discharge opening for discharging
the yellow ink to the edge of the capping member at

the side thereof proximate to said discharge opening for discharging
the black ink.
A combination according to
claim 1,
characterized in that

during capping the distance between a discharge opening surface
of said discharge openings and an inner surface of said

capping member is not more than 2.0 mm.
A combination according to claim 2, wherein an ink absorber
(22) is provided in said capping member.
A combination according to claim 2, wherein the distance is not
more than 1.0 mm. 
A combination according to claim 4, wherein the distance is not
more than 0.6 mm.
A combination according to claim 2, wherein said capping member
has an elastic cap (20) and a cap holder (21) holding said

elastic cap.
An ink jet apparatus comprising the combination of claim 1. 
An ink jet apparatus according to claim 7, wherein there
are a greater number of said discharge openings for discharging

the black ink than there are for each of the yellow ink,
the cyan ink and the magenta ink. 
An ink jet apparatus according to claim 7, comprising
a single ink jet head (2) including all of said discharge

openings for the yellow ink, the cyan ink, the magenta
ink and the black ink.
An ink jet apparatus according to claim 7, comprising
independent ink jet heads (2Yo, 2Co, 2Mo, 2Bo), each

including said discharge openings for one of the yellow ink,
the cyan ink, the magenta ink and the black ink. 
An ink jet apparatus according to claim 7, wherein said
discharge openings are arranged in a single direction.
An ink jet apparatus according to claim 11, wherein said
discharge openings are arranged in a line in said direction.
An ink jet apparatus according to claim 7, wherein said
discharge openings for each of the yellow ink, the cyan ink,

the magenta ink and the black ink are arranged in separate
