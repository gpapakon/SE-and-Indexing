surgical needle, which comprises a frame member 12 including 

an anvil member 98 having an arcuate surface profile; a 
movable first die member 100 for simultaneously imparting an 

arcuate profile and at least a pair of first opposing flat 
surfaces to a body portion of a needle blank and adapted to 

receive a needle blank, the first die member having an arcuate 
needle forming surface 106 which is substantially parallel to 

the arcuate surface of the anvil member; a first side tool 66 
for curving a tapered end portion of the needle blank about 

the anvil; a transfer tool 62 adapted to slide the needle 
blank along the anvil; a side press 128, 138 adapted to impart 

second flat surfaces to a second pair of opposing sides of the 
body portion of the needle blank; a second side tool member 70 

for curving a drill end portion of the needle blank about the 
anvil; and an ejection tool 76 for moving the needle blank 

away from the anvil.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to needle forming
devices. More particularly, the invention relates to a
multistation needle forming apparatus for simultaneously flat
pressing, and curving and then side pressing a needle blank to
form curved, rectangular bodied needles. The apparatus is
capable of forming the needle blank about a single forming
member. The invention relates further to a method of forming
a curved, flat sided surgical needle.The production of needles involves many processes
and different types of machinery in order to prepare quality
needles from raw stock. These varying processes and machinery
become more critical in the preparation of surgical needles
where the environment of intended use is in humans or animals.
Some of the processes involved in the production of surgical
grade needles include, inter alia: straightening spooled wire
stock, cutting needle blanks from raw stock, tapering or
grinding points on one end of the blank, providing a bore for
receiving suture thread at the other end of the blank,
imparting flat surfaces on opposite sides of the blank by flat
pressing a portion of the needle blank to facilitate grasping
by surgical instrumentation and curving the needle where
curved needles are desired. Additional processing may be done
to impart flat surfaces substantially perpendicular to the
flat pressed portions of the needle blank by side pressing a
portion of the needle blank to further facilitate grasping by 
surgical instrumentation and insertion into humans or animals.
Conventional needle processing is, in large part, a labor
intensive operation requiring highly skilled labor.
Generally, extreme care must be taken to ensure that only the
intended working of the needle is performed and the other
parts of the needle remain undisturbed.Curved rectangular bodied needles have advantages
over other needle configurations in many surgical procedures
for a variety of reasons including, uniformity of entry depth
for multiple sutures and proper "bite" of tissue surrounding
the incision or wound. When providing curved rectangular
bodied needles for surgical procedures it is desirable for the
needles to have a specified rectangular cross-section and a
specified curvature, i.e., a predetermined radius of
curvature. The desired cross-section and radius of curvature
for the finished needle varies with specific applications.Known methods of forming curved rectangular bodied
needles require several separate and distinct operations on
various machinery. The needle blank must first be flat

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for forming a curved, flat sided
surgical needle, which comprises:


a) a frame portion; and
b) forming means associated with said frame portion (12)
for substantially simultaneously imparting an arcuate profile

and a first pair of opposing flat surfaces to a body portion
of a needle blank.
The apparatus as recited in claim 1 wherein said
forming means comprises:


a) a forming member, having an arcuate surface;
b) first tool means movable with respect to said
frame member for simultaneously imparting an arcuate profile

and at least a first pair of opposing flat surfaces to a body
portion of a needle blank; and
c) means for moving said first tool means from a
first position remote from said forming member to a second

position adjacent said forming member.
The apparatus as recited in claim 2 wherein:

a) said forming member includes an anvil (98) having an
arcuate surface; and
b) said first tool means includes a first movable
die member (100) adapted to receive a needle blank, said first die

member having an arcuate needle forming surface (106) which is 
substantially parallel to said arcuate surface of said anvil

member.
The apparatus as recited in claim 2 or 3,
further comprising means for moving the needle blank from a

first position on said forming member to a second position on
said forming member.
The apparatus as recited in claim 4, wherein
said moving means includes a transfer bar (62) adapted to slide the

needle blank along said forming member from said first
position to said second position.
The apparatus as recited in claim 2, 3, 4 or 5,
further comprising means to curve a drilled end portion about

said forming member.
The apparatus as recited in claim 6, wherein
said curving means includes a second side tool (70) movable from a

position remote from said forming member to a position bending
the drilled end portion between said second side tool and said

forming member.
The apparatus as recited in claim 2 further
comprising side press means (128, 138) to impart a second pair of flat

surfaces to second opposing sides of the body portion of the
needle blank, such that the second flat surfaces are

substantially perpendicular to said first flat surfaces.
The apparatus as recited in claim 8 wherein
said side press means includes a first side press surface

stationary with respect to said forming member and a second
side press surface slidable along said forming member, wherein

the body portion of the needle blank is pressed between said
first and second side press surfaces. 
The apparatus as recited in any one of the
preceding claims, further comprising first side tool means to

curve a tapered end portion of the needle blank.
The apparatus as recited in claim 10, wherein
said first side tool means includes a first side tool (66) having

an arcuate recessed needle engaging surface at one end
thereof, said first side tool movable from a position remote

from said forming member to a position wherein said first die
tool bends said tapered end portion between said arcuate

recessed surface and said forming member.
A method of forming a curved, flat sided
surgical needle comprising the steps of:


a) loading a needle blank onto a first tool; and
b) simultaneously curving and imparting first flat
surfaces to at least a first pair of opposing sides of a body

portion of the needle blank.
The method according to claim 12, wherein said
curving and imparting includes positioning the needle blank

adjacent an arcuate surface of said first tool, and pressing
the body portion of the needle blank between the first tool

and an arcuate surface (106) of a forming member at a first position
on said forming member.
The method according to claim 13, further
comprising transferring the needle blank to a second position

on said arcuate surface of said forming member.

bending a tapered end portion of the needle blank between a

forming surface and a first side tool member (66).
The method according to claim 12, 13, 14 or 15
further comprising side pressing the needle blank to impact

second flat surfaces to second opposing sides of the body
portion of the needle blank by pressing the body portion of

member, said second flat surfaces being imparted substantially

perpendicular to said first flat surfaces.
The method according to any one of claims 12 to
16, further comprising curving a drilled end portion of the

needle blank by pressing the drilled end portion around said
