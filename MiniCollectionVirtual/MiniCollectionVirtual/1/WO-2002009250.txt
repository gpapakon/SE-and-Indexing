<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device for axially retaining a cylindrical element and more particularly a cable (1) comprising a socket (7, 9) with an external thread and extended in the axial direction by clamping plates (9), and an overlapping nut (6) comprising internally a shrunk pressure surface (11) designed to act on the ends of the clamping plates (9) of the socket and radially deform them towards the cylindrical element (1) previously inserted into said socket after passing through said nut (6). Said device is in particular characterised in that it further comprises a sleeve (8, 10) likewise provided with clamping plates (10) and whereof the external diameter is not larger than the internal diameter of the socket wherein said sleeve is designed to be inserted starting with said plates (10) with which it is provided, said socket being further internally provided with a shrunk pressure surface (12), designed to act on the sleeve clamping plates (10). In one embodiment, a packing seal is further provided.
