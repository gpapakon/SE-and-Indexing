<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a torsional vibration damper with a viscous damping medium, particularly for piston machines. Starting from the disadvantages of the known prior art, the intention is to provide a torsional vibration damper with a viscous damping medium which is distinguished by a simple structure in terms of construction, is easy to assemble, allows the installation of additional tuning elements without additional sealing and in which the displacer effect of the damping medium does not have an effect on the operation of the tuning elements. The proposed solution is that the tuning elements 2, 2', 3, 3', 18, 21 should be arranged on a smaller radius than the gap space 23, 23' and should consist of ring segments 2, 2', 3, 3' which are arranged offset relative to one another and alternately on the hub part 1, 1' and the flywheel 4, 4', 5, 6, at a distance from one another. Arranged between the ring segments is an elastic element which is secured on at least one of the ring segments. The gap space is connected to a balance space 24, for the reception of fluid escaping from the said space during operation, and the filling volume of the viscous fluid in the torsional vibration damper corresponds to the volume of the gap space. A spring can be arranged as the elastic element between the ring segments. The spring is, for example, designed as a compression spring 21 and guided on a stud 18 which is secured on the ring segment 3, 3'. In practice, it has proven advantageous if a stud is secured on each of the two sides of the ring segment. A bearing band 8, 8' is arranged in a floating manner between the hub part and the flywheel as a radial bearing for the flywheel.
