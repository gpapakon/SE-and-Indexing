<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for automatically 
changing reels for feeding webs of wrapping material, 
especially for cigarette packaging machines,which comprises: 
a magazine for a row of full replacement reels which 
stand coaxially with each other on feed means for 
successively feeding replacement reels from said row to a 
collecting station which collects the frontmost reel of said 
row; a first unwinding mandrel which is rotatable about an 
axis parallel with the common axis of the row of full reels 
in the magazine, on which mandrel it is possible removably 
to place the core of an unwinding reel; a second transfer mandrel having an axis parallel with 
the first unwinding mandrel and which is movable in both 
axial directions and on which transfer mandrel it is 
possible to removably place the core of the frontmost reel 
of the row of full replacement reels, said transfer mandrel 
being mounted on a transfer arm by which said frontmost full 
replacement reel, placed on the transfer mandrel, is 
transferred from the collecting station to a further station  
 
and then from this station to the unwinding station where, 
after the core of the finished unwinding reel has been 
removed from the unwinding mandrel, said full replacement 
reel is passed from the transfer mandrel to the unwinding 
mandrel, while the transfer mandrel is then disengaged from 
the reel and returned from the unwinding station to the 
magazine. A device of this kind is known from the document 
GB-A-2256180, which discloses the most relevant prior art. 
In the device known from this document the unwinding mandrel 
is stationary in a fixed position and the unwinding reel is 
freely rotatable on this mandrel, while the second transfer 
mandrel cannot rotate about its axis and no station is 
provided for joining the head end of the web to the web of 
the nearly finished unwinding reel. The object of the invention is to provide a 
reel-changing device of the type described above of 
inexpensive and relatively simple construction, capable in a 
functionally reliable way of automatically replacing 
finished reels of wrapping material with full reels even if 
these are very heavy, with no interruption in the web of 
wrapping material fed to the machine and without requiring 
that the machine be stopped. The invention achieves the above objects with a device 
for changing reels for feeding webs of wrapping material, 
especially for cigarette packaging machines, according to 
the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 and characterized
