<ABSTRACT>
Device for feeding sheets of, for example, foil, 
especially for use in cigarette packing machines, with a 

drum (7) having cells (2') in which the sheets (8) are 
folded around individual groups (3) of cigarettes (S) as 

each group (3) of cigarettes (S) is transferred from a 
transfer drum (1) having cells (2) to said folding drum 

(7) at a transfer point (T) where the cigarette-carrying 
cells (2, 2') of the two drums (1, 7) coincide face to 

face and to where the sheet (8) is fed in a predetermined 
position with respect to the group (3) of cigarettes (S) 

and between the cells (2, 2') of the two drums (1, 7) by 
pick-up/positioning means (14, 114) associated with the 

transfer drum (1). According to the invention the sheet 
(8) pick-up/positioning means consist of a separate pick-up/positioning 

drum (14, 114) supported coaxially with 
the transfer drum (1) and rotated (21) independently of 

it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for feeding 
wrapper sheets, especially for use in cigarette packing 
machines, which device comprises a drum in which the 
sheets of, for example, foil are folded around individual 
groups of cigarettes, said drum being provided around its 
periphery with a plurality of cigarette-carrying cells, 
and a drum which transfers groups of cigarettes from a 
feed line to the folding drum which is likewise provided 
with at least one cigarette-carrying cell, said cell 
being carried to a transfer point in a coinciding position 
of alignment in front of an empty cigarette-carrying 
cell in the folding drum, while the group of 
cigarettes is moved by displacement means out of the cell 
of the transfer drum into the cell of the folding drum, 
the transfer drum being associated with means which pick 
up and position one sheet at a time in a predetermined 
position next to the group of cigarettes being transferred, 
between the transfer drum cell and the folding 
drum cell at the transfer point, so that as the group of 
cigarettes is transferred into the folding drum cell, the 
sheet is pushed by the cigarettes themselves into said 
cell and folded around them in a U shape. A device of this type is known from 
DE-A-37 31 063: here, the foil sheet pick-up/positioning 
means are carried by the transfer drum 
itself, rotating with it alongside each cigarette-carrying 
cell of said drum. The sheets must therefore be 
picked up by the transfer drum itself, already in the 
correct predetermined position with respect to the 
corresponding cigarette-carrying cell, as no means are 
provided to enable its position relative to said cell to 
be adjusted. Moreover, the transfer drum has only two 
diametrically opposite cigarette-carrying cells which are 
moved alternately and simultaneously, in a half-rotation 
of the drum, firstly to a cigarette group feed point,  
 
where the feed line arrives, and secondly to the point of 
transfer to the folding drum. The known device is consequently 
unable to increase the speed of rotation of the 
transfer drum above a certain limit, owing to the fact 
that at very high speeds accurate picking-up and positioning 
of the sheet can no longer be guaranteed. This 
drawback necessarily means that sheets not correctly 
positioned must be discarded, or else a defectively made 
pack must be discarded later. This fact and the fact that 
only two cigarette-carrying cells are provided are the 
reason for the undesirable limiting of operating speeds 
and hence of

in a coinciding position of alignment in front of an 
empty cigarette-carrying cell (2') in the folding drum

displacement means (9) out of the cell (2) of the transfer 

drum (1) into the cell (2') of the folding drum (7), 
the transfer drum (1) being associated with means (14, 

114) which pick up and position one sheet (8) at a time 
in a predetermined position next to the group (3) of 

cigarettes (S) being transferred, between the transfer 
drum (1) cell (2) and the folding drum (7) cell (2') at 

the transfer point (T), so that as the group (3) of 
cigarettes (S) is transferred into the folding drum (7) 

cell (2'), the sheet (8) is pushed by the cigarettes (S) 
themselves into said cell (2') and folded around them in 

a U shape (8'), characterized by a sheet (8) pick-up/positioning 
drum (14, 114) supported coaxially with 

the transfer drum (1) and rotated (21) independently of 
it. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
