<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel method of producing an adhesive stick which has a rotatable foot part with a rotary spindle, said spindle engaging in a holding device for the stick substance (piston, cup, anchoring plate) and the holding device being fitted into a sleeve which surrounds the stick substance. By means of the rotary spindle, the stick-shaped adhesive substance can be moved upwards and downwards. According to the invention, the sleeve (2), together with the piston (1), forms a one-part injection moulding which is connected to the sleeve wall via intended tearing points (3). For assembly, the foot part with the rotary spindle is pushed through a cutout arranged centrally in the piston until the upper part of the foot part strikes against the lower edge of the sleeve, the stick substance is then poured into the unit thus formed from the sleeve, piston and foot part with the rotary spindle and, after completing the filling operation, the rotatable foot part is actuated and the piston is thus raised into the intended end position (10) whilst tearing off the intended tearing points. The invention also relates to an arrangement for carrying out the method, consisting of   a) a rotatable foot part (7), a rotary element (7B) and a rotary spindle (7A), the foot part having two supporting plates (9A, 9B), and b) a one-part injection moulding comprising a sleeve part (2) which is open at both ends and a piston (1) with intended tearing points (3).

Process for producing a stick of adhesive with
rotatable base part which has a rotary spindle and is

firmly joined thereto, a plunger supporting the stick
material and a sleeve, surrounding the stick material,

with closure cap, characterized in that the sleeve,
together with the plunger, forms a one-part injection

moulding, the plunger being joined to the sleeve wall via
predetermined breaking points, in that the base part with

rotary spindle is pushed through a recess, arranged so as
to be centred, in the plunger until the lower sleeve

periphery comes to rest against the upper part of the
base part, in that the stick material is poured into the

unit thus formed comprising sleeve and base part with
rotary spindle and, after the filling operation is

complete, the rotatable base part is actuated and as a

result the plunger is lifted into the intended end
position by means of the support plate of the rotary

spindle, with tearing off of the predetermined breaking
points, the support plate of the plunger being pushed, by

means of peripheral notches or grooves provided on it,
onto guide webs provided on the inside of the sleeve

wall, whereupon the closure cap is placed on the sleeve
filled with adhesive.
Arrangement for carrying out the process
according to Claim 1, comprising


(a) a rotatable base part (7) which is firmly
joined, via a rotary element (7B), to a rotary spindle

(7A) and has support plates (9A, 9B) which correspond to
the clear diameter of the sleeve (2) and are arranged at

a distance from one another,
(b) a sleeve part (2) which is open at both ends
and has a plunger (1) which is firmly joined therein via

predetermined breaking points (3) and has anchoring
elements and support elements for the stick material, the

plunger being provided with a recess, arranged so as to
be centred, and having support vanes (11) on the outer

periphery, whereas guide webs (12) are provided on the
inner wall of the sleeve part (2) in the longitudinal

direction.
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the plunger (1) is designed in the form of

a small basket which has on its inner wall threaded lugs
(5A) and preferably also has threaded lugs (5B) on the

outer wall of the central recess.
Arrangement according to Claim 2 and/or 3,
characterized in that the recess, arranged so as to be

centred, in the plunger (1) is formed from at least two
elastic tongues (6) which are opposite one another and

simultaneously form the engagement in the rotary spindle
(7A).
Arrangement according to any of Claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that, in the filling position, at least

one air channel (4) is present between the inner wall of
the sleeve (2) and the part (7, 7A, 7B), which air

channel (4), after the part (7, 7A, 7B) has reached the
end position (10), is no longer connected to the space

filled with stick material.
