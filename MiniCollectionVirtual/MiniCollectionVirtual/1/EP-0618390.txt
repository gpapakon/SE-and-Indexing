<ABSTRACT>
The object is to provide a plastic pipe having improved resistance, inter alia, to methanol-containing fuels and improved mechanical properties. This is achieved by a multilayer plastic pipe comprising     I. at least one outer layer, II. at least one inner layer based on a moulding composition comprising polyvinylidene fluoride, III. a layer externally adjacent to the inner layer II. based on a moulding composition comprising a mixture of     a. polyamide (nylon),   b. poly(alkyl) acrylate,    where the layers are adhesively bonded to one another. The invention makes it possible to obtain plastic pipes having the desired improved property profile.
