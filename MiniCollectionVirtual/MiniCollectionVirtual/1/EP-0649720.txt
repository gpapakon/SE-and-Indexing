<ABSTRACT>
A method of molding a preform (21) in an injection 
stretch blow molding, wherein a gas is entered into the 

boundary between the preform (21) and an injection core (12) so that 
the gas pressure causes the preform (21) in an injection mold (1) to 

be insulated from the injection core (12), thereby allowing a 
high-temperature releasing of the preform (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
molding a preform employable where an injection molded 
preform is stretch blow molded to a molded product. An injection stretch blow molding is a method by 
which an injection molded preform is released from an 
injection mold and an injection core, and transferred to a 
blowing mold where the portion below the neck portion (also 
called a mouth portion) of the preform fixedly held by a neck 
mold is biaxially stretched and expanded by a stretching rod 
and blowing air to form a container such as a bottle having a 
thin-wall-thickness body; the stretch blow molding step is 
performed 
after the preform is released 
without being conditioned. The stretch blow molding step is 
performed in a state in which the thermal energy of the 
molten resin generated during injection molding is thermally 
maintained in the preform, so that it is considered desirable 
that the preform is at a temperature as high as possible, and  
 
therefore the preform is released from the injection mold as 
early as possible. The term "releasing a preform in a high temperature 
state" described in the present invention refers to a 
releasing of a preform wherein an intermediate state in which 
the internal portion of the preform still exhibits a high-temperature 
and an unsolidified state, and in which the shape 
of the preform is kept by its skin layer; the surface 
temperature of the preform after being released increases due 
to internal heat with time up to a peak value, and then 
decreases slowly. This high-temperature releasing cannot be easily 
performed for all molding materials, and for some molding 
materials, it is difficult to perform by conventional means 
even if the draft of the injection core is set to an 
allowable limit. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used 
widely as the molding material of thin-wall-thickness 
packaging containers has been easy to release; polypropylene 
(PP), polycarbonate (PC) and the like have been difficult to 
release; and polyethylene (PE) has been very difficult to 
release. Generally, when a molten resin is injected and 
charged into an injection cavity formed by an injection mold 
and an injection core, the inner and outer surfaces of the 
molten resin come into contact with the already-cooled cavity  
 
surface and injection core surface to cause them to be 
solidified due to quenching, thereby forming a skin layer. 
The skin layer increases in thickness with time and develops 
a contraction accordingly. The contraction causes the inner 
s

<CLAIMS>
A method of molding a preform in an injection stretch-blow-molding wherein 
an injection molded preform is released in a high temperature state from an 

injection mold and an injection core while being held by a neck mold, and the 
released preform is stretch-blow-molded to a molded product immediately after 

the injection molded preform is released, the method comprising the further 
steps of: 


starting to forcedly enter a gas having a predetermined pressure into the 
boundary between the preform formed by injecting a resin in an injection cavity 

and the injection core after the injection pressure holding step is completed 
so that the gas pressure causes an inner surface of the preform to be insulated 

from a surface of the injection core and the preform is urged against the 
cavity surface, thereby performing a cooling step for producing a skin layer of 

the preform, 
stopping entering the gas after the cooling step for producing the skin layer of 
the preform is completed, and releasing the preform in a state where the inner 

surface of the preform is insulated from the surface of the injection core. 
A method of molding a preform as set forth in claim 1, characterized in that 
the forcedly entering of the gas into the boundary between the preform and 

the injection core is started when the cooling step for producing the skin layer 
of the preform is started and is stopped when the cooling step for producing 

the skin layer of the preform is completed.
