<ABSTRACT>
A testing apparatus for in situ calibration of various types of pressure gauges (11) for the measuring of absolute pressure, manometric pressure or differential pressure. The apparatus comprises a reference chamber (2) wherein a desired pressure can be established with a very high accuracy. The pressure regulation is based on the output signal from a calibrated electronic pressure sensor (6) which is connected to the reference chamber (2), and on a reference signal (Vref), these signals being supplied to an electronic control circuit (7) controlling an especially developed regulating valve (13). The regulating valve (13) is arranged to precision-direct gas to respectively from the reference chamber (2), so that the pressure therein is established on the desired value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a testing apparatus for in 
situ calibration of pressure gauges, comprising a reference 
chamber for connection of the pressure gauge to be tested, a 
calibrated pressure sensor connected to the reference chamber, 
and a regulating means connected to a gas supply unit and 
arranged to regulate the pressure in the reference chamber. Current fields of use of such an apparatus are e.g. 
control of altimeters in aircrafts and control of pressure gauges 
which are used to measure gas deliveries for production platforms 
for hydrocarbons. The pressure gauges may be constructed to 
measure absolute pressure, manometric pressure or differential 
pressure. US A-3,106,084 describes pressure controllers which include a 
system for simulating altitude pressure variations. There is a loop 
regulated system wherein an input signal is derived from a variable 
reference source which may be calibrated to produce a reference signal 
which is coupled into a comparator for comparison with a feedback signal 
from a feedback transducer. The difference in feedback and reference 
input signals or error signal is coupled to an amplifier having an 
output coupled to an electro-hydraulic control valve. CH-A-641,562 shows an apparatus for calibrating a vacuummeter 
which allows to keep the temperature error on a minimum. SU-A-957,024 concerns a vacuum meter to be graduated by means 
of a known flow rate of graduating gas with an additional stream of gas 
entering through controlled bleed. According to what one knows, there has not be developed 
mobile equipment having sufficient precision and stability to 
operate in the field for control/calibration of high-precision 
pressure gauges. Thus, common practice is to disassemble the 
pressure gauges at given time intervals and send these to a 
laboratory for a fresh control/calibration (with e.g. a "dead 
weight tester"). This circumstantial procedure is a natural 
consequence of the fact that, outside specially equipped 
laboratories, it is difficult to procure relevant test conditions. One has tried various solutions with respect to 
procuring acceptable conditions for pressure calibration at the 
place of use. One has, for example, connected the pressure gauge 
in question and a precision pressure sensor to a common chamber 
of which the pressure may be regulated by means of a movable 
piston. It has, however, appeared to be difficult to obtain the 
pressure stability over time which is necessary, because even 
very small gas leakages or temperature changes

A testing apparatus for in situ calibration of pressure 
gauges, comprising a reference chamber (2) for connection of the 

pressure gauge (11) to be tested, a calibrated pressure sensor 
(6) connected to the reference chamber (2), and a regulating 

means (1) connected to a gas supply unit (5) and arranged to 
regulate the pressure in the reference chamber (2), 
CHARACTERIZED 
IN that
 the regulating means comprises a gas flow balancing means 

(13) connected to the reference chamber (2) and arranged to 
create a balance between supply of gas to and delivery of gas 

from the chamber, and a first and a second pressure regulator (15 
resp. 16) connected to an inlet (17) and an outlet (18), 

respectively, from the flow balancing means (13) and controlled 
by a feedback signal from the reference chamber (2), so that the 

first regulator (15) sees that the pressure at the inlet (17) of 
said means at any time is a little higher than the pressure of 

the reference chamber (2), and the second regulator (16) sees 
that the pressure at the outlet (18) at any time is a little 

lower than the pressure of the reference chamber (2), the flow 
balancing means (13) being adjustable under the influence of an 

output signal from an electronic control circuit (7) having a 
first input (8) for supply of the output signal from the 

calibrated pressure sensor (6), and having a second input (9) for 
supply of a reference signal (V

An apparatus according to claim 1, 
CHARACTERIZED IN 
that
 the first pressure regulator (15) has an input (3) which is 
connected to the gas supply unit (5), and the second pressure 

regulator (16) has an output (4) which is connected to a vacuum 
pump. 
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, 
CHARACTERIZED 
IN that
 the gas flow balancing means is a stepless regulating 
valve (13) comprising a cylinder (21) having a valve body (22) 

slidably arranged therein, the inlet (17) and outlet (18) of said 
means being arranged at respective ends of the valve body (22), 

so that the valve body with displacement opens the inlet (17)

displaced by means of an electric step motor (28), the step motor 
(28) being driven by the output signal from the electronic 

control circuit (7).
