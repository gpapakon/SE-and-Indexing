Packing means for pourable filling material, the packing means manufactured from paper,
plastic film or similar flexible material, in the form of a carrier bag or bag sealed at both ends

(1, 2), in which a pouring opening must be made by the consumer for removing filling
material from a filling space in a transitional area between one of the two sealed bag ends

(1, 2) and the adjacent narrow side wall (15) of the bag, 
characterised in that
 a holding
device (23; 23'), also of flexible material, is provided in one area of the other (1) of the two

sealed bag ends (1, 2) essentially diagonally opposite the pouring opening to be produced,
which device runs inside the outer contour of the bag, but can be removed from the bag in

order to empty the pouring material with a handle (35) provided on the outside.
Packing means according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the holding device (23; 23') is
formed from a flexible longitudinal strip (24; 24'), 
in that
 fastening points (27, 28) are formed
with the bag material starting from the transverse ends (25, 26) of this strip, and 
in that
 the
longitudinal strip (24; 24') exhibits over its length an over-dimension between its two

fastening points (27, 28).
Packing means according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the longitudinal strip (24; 24') is
provided with a material storage fold (29) to receive its length over-dimension in a

longitudinal area between its two fastening points (27, 28).
Packing means according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the part of the
holding device (23; 23') forming the handle (35) can be removed from the bag by means of a

withdrawal slot (36). 
Packing means according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the withdrawal slot (36; 36') may

be formed by tearing along a perforation or similar material weakening line in the bag
material.
Packing means according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the holding device
(23) is secured on the inside of the bag and is on the inside overlapped by an inner cover

sheet (30) also secured to the inside of the bag.
Packing means according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the cover sheet (30) forms with
the area of the bag interior facing it a receiving pocket that is sealed on all sides for the

holding device (23).
Packing means according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that
 the holding device
(23) is worked into the sealed bag end (1), in particular a moulded bottom, and is overlapped

on the outside by an outer cover sheet (7) secured on the outside of the sealed bag end (2)
and is securely connected to it.
Packing means according to claim 8 in conjunction with claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the
material storage fold (29) is Z-shaped in design and 
in that
 its outer partial length (39),
adjacent to the outer cover sheet (7) is securely connected to it, whilst its inner partial length

(40) is kept clear of a connection to the material of the sealed bag end (1).
Packing means according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that
 the pouring opening
is formed by an outlet section (18) for the filling material, which section includes a patch of

material that can be folded out of the narrow side wall (15) along a transverse folding line
(19) adjacent to the sealed bag end (2) to form the pouring opening.
Packing means according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 the two sealed bag
ends (1, 2) each exhibit the shape of a cross, block or similar moulded bottom, the moulded 

bottom exhibiting the holding device (23; 23') in the area of one of its two halves, being
provided with a filling valve (17) in its other half, on the end, for filling the bag.
Packing means according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 the sealed bag end
(2) opposing the sealed bag end (1) exhibiting the holding device (23; 23') is provided with a

handle (13) for transporting the filled bag by hand.
