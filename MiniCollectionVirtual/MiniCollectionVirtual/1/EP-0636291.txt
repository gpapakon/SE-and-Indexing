 COORDINATED CODING FOR DIGITAL TRANSMISSIONField of the InventionThis invention relates generally to digital systems and, more specifically, to the transmission of digital information over coordinated transmission paths, and to concomitant techniques for encoding and decoding the digital information.Background of the InventionNew telecommunications services recently introduced and presently being planned require that high-speed terminating equipment be interconnected to telecommunications service points using high capacity digital facilities. Accordingly, there is currently especial interest in high rate digital subscriber lines (HDSL) to carry 1.544 Mbit/sec bidirectional data over local copper telephone loops. As originally proposed, HDSL utilized two twisted wire pairs for transmission of the 1.544 Mbit/sec over the required distance range with an acceptable error rate. The basic communication environment of HDSL then is one wherein there are two channels available for transmission and each channel has additive noise with different power. Moreover, the transmitter has no knowledge of the power of the noise on each channel. Also, the noise powers are constant or vary slowly so that the receiver may estimate the noise statistics.The initial implementation of HDSL utilized so-called "uncoordinated" transmission to meet the acceptable error rate criterion, but oftentimes only marginally. With uncoordinated transmission, the total message represented by a data stream is divided and each channel independently carries a part of the stream. Uncoordinated transmission has good performance when each channel has about the same noise power, but if just one channel is very noisy then the message is lost. Another technique deployed to overcome limitations of uncoordinated transmission is called "symbol splitting" diversity. With symbol splitting diversity, a copy of the entire message is transmitted on each channel so that the message may still be fully recovered if one channel is very noisy. However, symbol splitting has relatively poor throughput performance if each channel has nearly the same noise power.Recently, in a paper entitled "Coordinated Transmission for Two-Pair Digital Subscriber Lines," IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Special Issue on High-Speed Digital Subscriber Lines . Vol. 9, pp. 920-930, August, 1991, J. W. Lechleider proposed an improvement to the performance of HDSL by coordinating the transmission on the two lines. In order to achieve the required improvement in the
