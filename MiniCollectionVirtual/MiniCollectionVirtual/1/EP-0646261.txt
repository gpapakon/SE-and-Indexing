<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and device for the determination of a dynamic code of a dynamic biological system. The analysis of measurements made on the biological system, which behaves in accordance with the laws of self-organization, enables future values to be determined. An extensively cross-linked artificial intelligence, like that occurring in neuronal networks for instance, is required for this. The necessary measurements are provided by suitable biosensors fitted at several points in the dynamic biological system under investigation.
