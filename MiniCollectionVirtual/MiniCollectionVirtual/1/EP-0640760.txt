<ABSTRACT>
A rotary distributor fuel injection pump includes a pumping plunger (14) 
housed in a bore (13) and has a spill valve member (30) integrally 

formed with an actuator piston (29) contained in a cylinder (28). High 
pressure fuel from the bore can be admitted to the one end of the 

cylinder (28) to move the actuator piston and valve member away from 
the seating by opening an on/off valve (24). When the spilled fuel has 

been returned to the bore further fuel flows to the bore by way of the 
on/off valve and this fuel flows to the on/off valve through a non-return 

valve (34) from a source (33) of fuel under pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a
multi-cylinder compression ignition engine and of the kind comprising a
rotary distributor member housed in body, a pumping plunger slidable
within a bore, a delivery channel formed in the distributor member, the
delivery channel communicating with said bore and being positioned to
register in turn with a plurality of outlet ports formed in the body during
successive inward movements of the pumping plunger, cam means for
imparting inward movement to the plunger to displace fuel from the bore
through said delivery channel, a spill valve member which is spring
biased into engagement with a seating, said spill valve member when
lifted from the seating during inward movement of the plunger allowing
fuel to spill from the bore, an actuator piston for said valve member said
actuator piston being located in a cylinder to one end of which fluid
under pressure can be supplied under the control of a valve means, and
a source of fuel from which fuel can be supplied to said bore.In the known form of apparatus of the aforesaid type the fuel is supplied
to the bore by way of a port in the body and passages in the distributor
member and a passage moves into register with the port during the time
when the plunger is allowed to move outwardly by the cam means.
During the period when the plunger can move outwardly the spill valve
also has to return into engagement with the seating and in arranging the
size and spacing of the ports and passages provision has to be made to
allow the timing of fuel to be varied. The result is that there may not be
adequate time available to complete the filling of the bore. GB 2253445 discloses an arrangement in which a spill valve member is
integral with a piston arrangement which is moveable under the
influence of fuel pressure applied thereto through an electromagnetically
actuated spill valve.An arrangement is described in GB 2161546 in which fuel is supplied to
the bore of a pump through a non-return valve. A restricted passage
permits communication between a passage connecting a control valve
and a piston. However, most of the supply of fuel to the bore of the
pump occurs through a separate passage.The object of the invention is to provide an apparatus of the kind
specified in an improved form.According to the present invention there is provided a fuel pumping
apparatus for supplying fuel to a multi-cylinder compression ignition
engine comprising a rotary distributor member housed in a body, a
pumping plunger
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fuel pumping apparatus for supplying fuel to a multi-cylinder
compression ignition engine comprising a rotary distributor member (10)

housed in a body (11), a pumping plunger (14) slidable within a bore
(13), a delivery channel (19) formed in the distributor member, the

delivery channel communicating with said bore and being positioned to
register in turn with a plurality of outlet ports (20) formed in the body

during successive inward movements of the pumping plunger, cam
means (16) for imparting inward movement to the plunger to displace

fuel from the bore through said delivery channel (19), a spill valve
member (30) spring biased into engagement with a seating, said spill

valve member when lifted from the seating during inward movement of
the plunger allowing fuel to escape from the bore, an actuator piston (29)

for said valve member said actuator piston being located in a cylinder
(28) to one end of which fluid under pressure can be supplied under the

control of a valve means, and a source (33) of fuel from which fuel can
be supplied to said bore (13), said valve means comprising an on/off

valve (24) which is positioned in a passage connecting said one end of
the cylinder (28) with said bore (13) and characterised by a non-return

valve (34) which connects a point intermediate said on/off valve (24) and
said one end of the cylinder (28) with said source (33) of fuel, whereby

fuel is only supplied to bore (13) via the said point intermediate the
on/off valve (24) and the one end of the cylinder (28). 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that said
non-return valve is a spring loaded ball valve. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised in
that the actuator piston (29) and the valve member (30) are integrally

formed with each other and the action of the spring (28) is to displace
the spilled fuel in the one end of the cylinder (28) to the bore (13) by

way of the spill passage and the on/off valve (34).
