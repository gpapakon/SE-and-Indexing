<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a data search apparatus having a 
processing device, a storage device, an input device responsive to user 

input, and a display device, the apparatus being characterised by: data 
extracting means within the processing device for dividing a sequence of 

data to be searched and for establishing a plurality of representative 
samples of data from said sequence of data; display means for sending 

said plurality of representative samples of data to the display device 
for display; the input device being responsive to user input to select 

two representative samples from among those displayed; and the processing 
device having a data search region determining and changing means 

responsive to the input device to determine, as a new sequence of data to 
be searched, a sequence of data whose start and end positions are 

specified by said two selected representative samples. This technique 
simplifies the data search area setting operation. 
Representative samples among a group of data to be searched are 
displayed, and two representative samples in the display are selected to 

specify a new area of data to be searched.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a data search apparatus and a method for
searching a sequence of data stored on a storage medium and visually
outputting desired data.When a specific frame of image data (representing one screen) at an
unknown storage location in movie data stored on a storage medium is to
be retrieved by a data search apparatus, the data search apparatus
normally reads the movie data on the storage medium sequentially from a
start storage location and displays such data on a display unit. Viewing
the display screen, the user waits for the appearance of a desired frame.
In such a sequential search method, the closer the storage location of
the desired frame is to the last part of the storage medium, the more
time is taken until the user finds the desired frame.A data search apparatus is proposed (JP-A-3 241 149)
in which the movie data is previously divided
into a plurality of blocks, a frame representing each block is displayed
as an icon, and the user nominates a desired icon to specify that the
movie data block shown by the nominated icon is to be searched.In the method of JP-A-3 241 149,
it is assumed that the data to be searched has been
previously divided into a plurality of partial regions. The method was
explained such that a region to be searched is narrowed to one of the
partial regions. However, the problem with this method is that a region
stretching over a plurality of partial regions cannot be specified as a
searching target at the same time. Therefore, an inefficient search is
required such that the partial regions which may contain the objective
data are searched one by one. A second problem of this method is that
the only interface provided is for narrowing the region to be searched.
Therefore, when it is found that the objective data is not located in the
section as a result of search, it is necessary to specify the entire
partial region as a region to be searched and narrow again the region;
this considerably reduces the efficiency of search work. Furthermore, a
problem exists such that when a region including a number of
representative frames is specified as a region to be searched, it is
necessary to nominate a number of icons, which results in tedious
operation. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved
apparatus and method for searching data.Accordingly the present invention provides a data search apparatus
having a processing device, a storage device, an input device responsive
to user input, and a display device, the apparatus being characterised
by:
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A data search apparatus having a processing device (10A), a storage
device (30), an input device (40) responsive to user input, and a display

device (20), the apparatus being characterised by:

data extracting means within the processing device (10A) for
dividing a sequence of data to be searched and for establishing a

plurality of representative samples of data from said sequence of data;
display means for sending said plurality of representative samples
of data to the display device (20) for display;
the input device being responsive to user input to select two
representative samples from among those displayed; and
the processing device having a data search region determining and
changing means responsive to the input device to determine, as a new

sequence of data to be searched, a sequence of data whose start and end
positions are specified by said two selected representative samples.
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein each representative
sample established by the data extracting means is located at the

dividing position;
An apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 further comprising
initial data search region determining means for determining an initial

region of data to be searched according to a position on a scroll bar
specified by a user via the input device (40).
A method of operating an apparatus to search data, the apparatus
having a processing device (10A), a storage device (30), an input device

(40) responsive to user input, and a display device (20), the method
being characterised by the steps of:


employing the processing device to divide a sequence of data to be
searched and to establish a plurality of representative samples of data

from said sequence of data; 
displaying said plurality of representative samples of data on said
display device (20);
selecting two representative samples from among those displayed
based on user input entered via said input device (40); and
employing the processing device to determine, as a new sequence of

data to be searched, a sequence of data whose start and end positions are
specified by said two selected representative samples.
A method as claimed in claim 4, further comprising a step for
convertibly displaying a plurality of second representative samples,

which are established from the sequence of data searched before changing,
instead of a plurality of first representative samples established by the

processing device, this replacement taking place based on an external
instruction received upon display of said plurality of first

representative samples obtained from said new sequence of data to be
searched.
A method as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 further comprising the
step of determining whether or not there are representative samples

coinciding with each other between a plurality of second representative
samples obtained from said sequence of data to be searched before

changing and a plurality of first representative samples when said
plurality of first representative samples obtained from said new sequence

of data to be searched are displayed and, in the case of an affirmative
determination, changing the coinciding first representative samples to

display the changed samples.
A method as claimed in any of claim 4 to 6 wherein a start icon and
an end icon individually indicating said start and end positions of said

sequence of data to be searched are displayed in said representative
sample displaying step, the start or end position for said new sequence

of data to be searched being determined according to a selection of said
start icon or said end icon during the step of determining the new

sequence of data to be searched.
A method as claimed in any of claims 4 to 7, further comprising the
step of displaying a region specified by said selected two representative 

samples in connection with a display of said plurality of representative

is the image data of one frame.
A method as claimed in any of claims 4 to 8, wherein said sequence
of data is text data, and said representative sample is a predetermined

amount of data from within said text data.
