<ABSTRACT>
A device for recovering fuel vapours from a motor vehicle fuel tank (1), comprising a filtering cartridge (3) inserted between the tank and the inlet manifold (2) of the engine, wherein the cartridge vent duct (3A) is selectively connectable with the inlet vacuum by means of a pneumatic distributor (6'). The tightness of the device may thus be tested.

Device for recovering the vapours leaving a fuel 
tank of a motor vehicle, comprising in particular: 


a canister (3) for recovering vapours by filtering, 
comprising: 


a purge orifice (31) 
an inlet orifice (32) connected to the fuel 
tank (1) 
an atmospheric connection orifice (33) for 
discharging the filtered vapours to the atmosphere, 
a control solenoid valve (5) for purging the 
canister, connected 


by a first orifice (50) to the intake manifold 
(2) of an internal combustion engine, and 
by a second orifice (51) to the purge orifice 
(31) of the canister via a purge duct (3B) 
 
this device being characterized in that it comprises 

means (6, 6') allowing the atmospheric connection orifice 
(33) of the canister to be connected selectively to the 

atmosphere or to the second orifice (51) of the purge 
solenoid valve (5) in order to set up a controlled 

partial vacuum in the device without disturbing the 
regulation of the air/fuel mixture supplied to the 

engine. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the means (6, 6') consist of a first three-way 

distributor (6). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a partial-vacuum sensor (4) is connected to the duct 

connecting the canister to the tank.  
 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it further comprises a second three-way 

distributor (7) connecting the second orifice (51) of the 
solenoid valve (5): 


to the purge orifice (31) of the canister via the 
purge duct (3B) in the rest position, or 
to the atmospheric connection orifice (33) via 
the distributor (6) and simultaneously closing 

the duct (3B) in the working position, respectively. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the means (6, 6') consist of a four-way distributor 

(6') 

simultaneously connecting the second orifice (51) 
of the solenoid valve (5) to the purge orifice 

(31) of the canister and the atmospheric connection 
orifice (33) to the atmosphere, in the rest 

position, or 
connecting the said second orifice (51) to the 
atmospheric connection orifice (33) and simultaneously 

closing the duct (3B) in the working 
position, respectively. 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that the partial-vacuum sensor (4) is connected on the 

duct (3B) connecting the canister (3) to the distributor 
(6', 7).
