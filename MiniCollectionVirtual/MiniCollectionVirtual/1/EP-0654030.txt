<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to imidazole 
derivatives having A II antagonist activity, the 
processes for the preparation thereof, pharmaceutical 
compositions containing them and the use thereof as 
therapeutical agents. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a 
proteolytic chain which plays a paramount role in the 
control of blood pressure and is apparently involved in 
the onset and the maintainement of some cardiovascular 
disorders, such as hypertension and cardiac 
decompensation. The octapeptide hormone angiotensin II (A II), the 
final product from RAS, mainly forms in the blood 
following to the degradation of angiotensin I, carried 
out by the ACE enzyme, which is located in endothelium 
of blood vessels, lungs, kidney and many other organs. 
Such an hormone exerts a strong vasoconstricting action 
on arteries, due to its interaction with specific 
receptors located on the cell membranes. One of the possible ways to control RAS is the A 
II antagonism at the receptor level. Some peptide 
analogues of A II (for example saralasin, sarmesin) are 
known to competitively block the interactions of said 
hormone, however the use thereof, both experimentally 
and clinically, is restricted by a partial agonist 
activity and by the lack of activity by the oral route. Recently, a number of compounds having a non-peptide 
structure, deriving from 5-membered 
heterocycles, were described to have II antagonist  
 
activity. Examples of these compounds are claimed in 
patents EP 253,310, EP 324,377, PCT 91/00277, PCT 
91/00281 PCT 91/14367, PCT 91/15206, PCT 92/00977. A common characteristic of these compounds is that 
they have a completely substituted imidazole ring. The present invention relates to imidazole 
derivatives, of general formula (I), having an aryl or 
heteroaryl group, which can be unsubstituted or 
functionalized at the 4- or 5- position of the 
imidazole ring. In the compounds of the invention, an 
hydrogen atom on the imidazole ring and a 
biphenylmethyl moiety linked to the imidazole by a 
nitrogen-carbon bond are always present. These novel derivatives have A II antagonist 
properties and they can be used in various 
cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, cardiac 
decompensation, in the myocardial ischemia posttreatment 
or in intraocular hypertension, glaucoma, 
some renal diseases and hyperaldosteronism. The compounds of the invention have general 
formula (I): 
 
wherein: 
n can be 0, 1 or 2  
 X can be O, S, 
 
wherein Z can be C or N, 
whereas Y can be H, when Z is the
