<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automobile brake system with an electronically controllable brake booster (21) comprising a vacuum chamber (23) and a pressure chamber (24) which are separated from one another by a movable wall (22). The brake booster also comprises a control valve assembly (30) which can be actuated by an electromagnetic actuating device (26) and can be adjusted by a pressure differential between the pressure and vacuum chambers. The position of the movable wall (22) changes according to the pressure relationships in the vacuum chamber (23) the pressure chamber (24) thus operating a main brake cylinder (25). During operation, the electromagnetic actuating device (26) is loaded with current signals by an electronic control unit (ECU). Said signals are generated by the electronic control unit (ECU) according to the driving dynamic conditions or external influences. The invention is characterized in that during the existence of certain driving dynamic conditions, external influences or combinations thereof which necessitate the operation of the main brake cylinder (25) within a predetermined time interval having a predetermined probability, the electronic control unit (ECU) generates current signals for the electromagnetic actuating device (26) such that the control valve assembly (30) is operated in such a way that available play, free motion or tolerance conditioned free travel are overcome at least in one part of the automobile brake system.
