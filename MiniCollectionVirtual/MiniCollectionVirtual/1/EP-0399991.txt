1. A device for controlling the lift of a hydraulically 
operated valve comprising an actuating element bounding 

an actuating chamber in the valve cage, which element is 
pressure-loaded or spring-loaded in closing direction, 

and further comprising a pressure-generating unit, 
wherein is provided a flying setting plunger (7) guided 

in a cylinder (6), which bounds a pressure chamber (10) 
in the cylinder (6) and separates the pressure 

chamber (10) from the actuating chamber (9), in the valve 
cage (5), and wherein is provided that the pressure-generating 

unit (13) have a high-pressure line (18) 
controlled by a valve (19) and leading into the pressure 

chamber (10), as well as a low-pressure line (21) 
controlled by a another valve (22) and leading into the 

actuating chamber (9), the setting plunger (7) being 
pressed against a stop (8) in the cylinder (6) at maximum 

lift of the valve (2). 
2. A Device according to claim 1, wherein the valve 
cage (5) and the cylinder (6) containing the setting 

plunger (7) are integrated in one piece, such that the 
valve axis (2′) and the axis (7′) of the setting 

plunger (7) coincide. 
3. A device according to claim 1, wherein is provided a 
solenoid-controlled two-way valve (22), which is located 

in the low pressure line (21) connected to the  
 

pressure-generating unit (13) via a reducing valve (20), 
a return line (23) with a pressure-maintaining 

element (24; 31) being included between the reducing 
valve (20) and the two-way valve (22). 
4. A device according to claim 3, wherein the pressure-maintaining 
element is configured as a pressure-tank (31) 

with an air cushion. 
5. A device according to claim 1, wherein a solenoid-controlled 
three-way valve (19) is located in the 

high-pressure line (18), one of whose outlet is connected 
to the pressure chamber (10) while the other one leads to 

a return line (29) containing a throttle (30). 
6. A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, for control 
of a fuel/gas injection valve of an internal combustion 

engine, wherein the valve (2), which opens outwardly, 
controls a gas exchange chamber (28) located in the valve 

cage (5) which chamber (28) is connected to the 
pressure-generating unit (13) via a metering device (27). 
7. A device according to any of claims 1 to 5, for control 
of a fuel injection valve of an internal combustion 

engine, wherein the valve (2), which opens inwardly, 
controls a fuel chamber (33) located in the valve 

cage (5), which chamber (33) is connected to the 
pressure-generating unit (13) via a pressure line (26).  

 
8. A method for controlling the lift of a hydraulically 
operated valve whose actuating element is pressure-loaded 

or spring-loaded in closing direction, wherein an 
actuating chamber, which is situated between an actuating 

element of the valve and a flying setting plunger, is 
subjected to low pressure in the closed position of the 

valve, such that the setting plunger is lifted from a 
stop, until a valve controlling the low pressure is 

closed, which will define a given lift, and wherein the 
setting plunger is subjected to high pressure via the 

control of a valve, such that the setting plunger is 
moved until it reaches its stop and the valve is forced 

open by the incompressible medium in the actuating 
chamber, and finally, wherein the low pressure control 

valve is opened, such that the actuating chamber is 
emptied and the valve is closed by the closing force 

acting on the actuating element.
