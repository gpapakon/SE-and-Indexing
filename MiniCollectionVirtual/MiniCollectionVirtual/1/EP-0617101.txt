<ABSTRACT>
A water soluble pressure sensitive adhesive composition is disclosed 
wherein potyvinyl methyl ether is the major component and a styrenic block 

copolymer is the second component, the polyvinyl methyl ether and styrenic 
block copolymer present in a weight ratio of from about 95:5 to about 88:12, 

said styrenic block copolymer in said composition comprising less than 
about 14 percent by weight of the weight of the polyvinyl methyl ether. The 

pressure sensitive adhesive is useful for bonding polyethylene, 
polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymers, and paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel adhesive compositions and to the easy 
removal of adhesive residue from a substrate without use of an organic 
solvent. More particularly, it relates to compositions which are especially 
suited for use as pressure sensitive adhesives characterized by their excellent 
properties of outstanding creep resistance and cohesive strength and which 
are based on polyvinyl methyl ether. These adhesive compositions can be in 
the form of hot-melts or solvent-based compositions, either water-based or 
organic solvent-based. Water based compositions are preferred. Adhesive 
residues are water-removable without use of an organic solvent. Hot-melt adhesives are frequently used because they can be cheaper 
than organic solvent based formulations, can give quick tack in the molten 
state, harden quickly on cooling, have no residual solvent odor or taste and 
their application is often a one-step procedure. However, hot-melt adhesives 
are not normally applicable to substrates subject to degradation at hot-melt 
application temperatures. Organic solvent-based adhesives can be more 
expensive because of organic solvent requirement and the potential need for 
solvent recovery. Water-based adhesives can be preferred because of cost 
and reduced environmental problems. Water-based adhesives are taught in the prior art. Plitt, U. S. Patent 
2,985,609, teaches a water-based pressure sensitive adhesive comprising a 
composition of polyvinyl alcohol and polyethyleneimine. However, as Davis, 
U. S. Patent 3,249,572 reports, the compositions of Plitt suffer from poor heat 
stability which results in gradual discoloration of the adhesive film as well as 
the substrate to which the adhesive is applied. Davis indicates the aging 
discoloration is overcome by the addition of acids to the Plitt adhesive 
compositions. As is known in the art, pressure sensitive adhesives comprise a class of 
adhesive compositions which may be formulated from a variety of materials 
such as gums and resins of both natural and synthetic derivation, which 
typically are not water-soluble. When coated on a suitable substrate, these 
adhesive compositions share the common characteristic of being aggressively 
and permanently tacky at room temperature and are thus able to adhere to 
surfaces by the application of nothing more than manual pressure. Adhesives 
of this type may be applied to various substrates such as paper, cloth and  
 
plastic films, and the resulting coated substrate may then be converted to 
tapes and
