<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to gelled
fracturing fluids of the type used in well bore
operations and particularly to a method for producing
a gradual reduction in the viscosity of a gelled
fracturing fluid through the use of enzymes
incorporated in the gelled fluid.During hydraulic fracturing, a sand laden fluid
is injected into a well bore under high pressure.
Once the natural reservoir pressures are exceeded,
the fracturing fluid initiates a fracture in the
formation which generally continues to grow during
pumping. The treatment design generally requires the
fluid to reach maximum viscosity as it enters the
fracture which affects the fracture length and width.
This viscosity is normally obtained by the gellation
of suitable polymers, such as a suitable
polysaccharide. The gelled fluid can be accompanied
by a propping agent which results in placement of the
propping agent within the fracture thus produced.
The proppant remains in the produced fracture to
prevent the complete closure of the fracture and to
form a conductive channel extending from the well
bore into the formation being treated once the
fracturing fluid is recovered.The recovery of the fracturing fluid is
accomplished by reducing the viscosity of the fluid 
to a low value such that it flows naturally from the
formation under the influence of formation fluids and
pressure. This viscosity reduction or conversion is
referred to as "breaking" and can be accomplished by
incorporating chemical agents, referred to as
breakers, into the initial gel.In addition to the importance of providing a
breaking mechanism for the gelled fluid to facilitate
recovery of the fluid, the timing of the break is
also of great importance. Gels which break
prematurely can cause suspended proppant material to
settle out of the gel before being introduced a
sufficient distance into the produced fracture.
Premature breaking can also result in a premature
reduction in the fluid viscosity resulting in a less
than desirable fracture length in the fracture being
created.On the other hand, gelled fluids which break too
slowly can cause slow recovery of the fracturing
fluid from the produced fracture with attendant delay
in resuming the production of formation fluids.
Additional problems can result, such as the tendency
of proppant to become dislodged from the fracture,
resulting in at least partial closing and decreased
efficiency of the fracturing operation.For purposes of the present application,
premature breaking will be understood to mean that
the gel viscosity

<CLAIMS>
A method of fracturing a subterranean formation which
surrounds a well bore comprising the steps of:


forming a gellable fracturing fluid by blending
together an aqueous fluid, a hydratable guar polymer

having repeating units of mannose and galactose linked by
1,4-β-D mannosidic and 1,6-α-D-galactomannosidic linkages,

a suitable crosslinking agent for crosslinking the
hydratable polymer to form a polymer gel and an enzyme

breaker;
pumping the cross-linked polymer gel to a desired
location in the well bore under sufficient pressure to

fracture the surrounding subterranean formation;
allowing the enzyme breaker to degrade the cross-linked
polymer, whereby the fluid can be pumped from the

subterranean formation back to the well surface;

   characterised in that the enzyme breaker is a
hydrolase effective to attack the 1,4-β-D mannosidic

linkage and the 1,6-α-D-galactomannosidic linkage, and
stable in the pH range of about 2.0 to 11.0 and which

remains active at a pH above about 8.0.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the enzyme
breaker is a 1:2 solution of 1,6-α-D-galactosidase and

mannan endo-1,4-β-mannosidase.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein
the crosslinking agent is a source of borate ions.
A method as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the
crosslinking agent is sodium borate decahydrate.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, wherein the pH of the guar based gellable 

fracturing fluid is raised to the range about 8.0 to 11.0
through use of a suitable buffer.
A method as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the gel pH is
in the range 9.0 to 10.0.
