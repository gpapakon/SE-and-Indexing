<ABSTRACT>
The port comprises a ferrule (20) attached to a 
sheet metal shell (13) which is formed with a domed end 

portion (14) having a central aperture (21). The 
ferrule (20) includes four angularly spaced slots (26) 

adapted to receive and interlock with tabs (28) spaced 
angularly around the aperture (21) in order to fasten 

the ferrule (20) securely to the shell (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to filters 
and more particularly to an improved drain/fill/sensor 
port for a fuel filter. Fuel filters such as fuel/water separators for 
internal combustion engines include a closed sheet 
metal vessel or shell which houses a filter element 
that is held and located within the shell by a coil 
spring. During typical operations, fuel flows through 
the filter element while water and heavier molecular 
parties are separated from the fuel and accumulate in a 
domed lower end portion of the shell. The water and 
other contaminants which accumulate as a result of the 
filtering process must be drained periodically from the 
shell. To this end, the domed end of the shell includes 
a port comprising a central aperture and a ferrule 
which is in the form of a metal ring with internal 
threads. A drain plug usually is threaded into the 
ferrule. Alternatively, a sensor with a selectively 
openable and closable drain valve may be threaded into 
the ferrule. The sensor is used to detect a variety of 
conditions within the filter. In use the filter is subjected to elevated 
pressures and thus the port must be designed to avoid 
leakage and to resist failure in a high pressure 
environment. Commercially available filters, which 
employ conventionally designed drain/fill/sensor ports, 
often experience severe performance limitations when 
repeatedly subjected to elevated pressures. Indeed, 
when subjected to testing, one presently commercially 
available filter housing bursts at an average pressure 
of 1,58 MPa and required replacement after only 53,000 
test cycles. The ports of conventional filters are often 
constructed by punshing a hexagonal aperture through 
the center of the domed shell. A ferrule is then  
 
positioned within the aperture and is secured to the 
shell with an adhesive sealant such as Plastisol to 
complete the port. This design is less than optimal 
because the hexagonal central aperture, when subjected 
to high pressure, quickly develops fatigue cracking in 
its corners. In extreme cases, such fatigue cracking 
can eventually result in bursting since, during use, 
fuel is continually forced through the filter at high 
pressure and impose relatively high stress on the port. Further, conventional port designs require two 
sealing points which often result in leakage problems 
in addition to the problems of bursting mentioned 
above. The first sealing point is disposed between the 
ferrule and the shell and is achieved by affixing the 
ferrule to the

<CLAIMS>
A filter (12) comprising a sheet metal shell 
(13) having a filter element (14A) therein, said shell 

(13) having an end (14) with a central aperture (21) 
extending therethrough, an interiorly threaded ferrule 

(20) located adjacent said aperture (21), said filter 
being characterized in that said ferrule (20) is formed 

with a plurality of angularly spaced and radially 
inwardly opening slots (26), and a plurality of 

angularly spaced tabs (28) formed integrally with said 
shell (13) adjacent said aperture (21) and extending 

radially outwardly into said slots (26) to lock said 
ferrule (20) to said shell (13). 
A filter (12) as claimed in claim 1, in which 
said tabs (28) engage surfaces of said slots (26) to 

clamp said ferrule (20) axially against said end (14) 
of said shell (13). 
A filter (12) as claimed in claim 2, in which 
said tabs (28) are engageable with ends of said slots 

(26) to restrict rotation of said ferrule (20) relative 
to said shell (13). 
A filter (12) as claimed in anyone of claim 1 
to 3, in which said ferrule (20) includes a central 

opening (25) located radially inwardly of said slots 
(26), said aperture (21) including an axially extending 

annular flange (30) located within said opening (25) to 
restrict movement of said ferrule (20) radially of said 

shell (13). 
A filter (12) as claimed in claim 4, in which 

said ferrule (20) includes a threaded bore (23) coaxial 
with and spaced axially from said central opening (25) 

and having a diameter smaller than the diameter of said 
central opening (25) and no larger than the inner 

diameter of said annular flange (30).  
 
A filter (12) as claimed in claim 5, further 
including a threaded member (16) screwed into said 

threaded bore (23), and an O-ring (35) encircling said 
threaded member (16) and compressed against said flange 

(30) to seal said aperture (21).
