<ABSTRACT>
A process of forming a single color, dye 
ablation image having an improved D-min comprising 

imagewise-heating by means of a laser, a dye-ablative 
recording element comprising a support having thereon a 

dye layer comprising an image dye dispersed in a 
polymeric binder having an infrared-absorbing material 

associated therewith, the laser exposure taking place 
through the dye side of the element, wherein the 

ablated image dye material is removed by means of an 
air stream to obtain an image in the dye-ablative 

recording element, and the element contains a 
hydrophilic dye barrier layer between said support and 

said dye layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a
barrier layer in a laser dye-ablative recording
process.In recent years, thermal transfer systems
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures
which have been generated electronically from a color
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to
color separation by color filters. The respective
color-separated images are then converted into
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals.
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal
printing head has many heating elements and is heated
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta and
yellow signals. The process is then repeated for the
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a
screen. Further details of this process and an
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S.
Patent No. 4,621,271.Another way to thermally obtain a print using
the electronic signals described above is to use a
laser instead of a thermal printing head. In such a
system, the donor sheet includes a material which
strongly absorbs at the wavelength of the laser. When
the donor is irradiated, this absorbing material
converts light energy to thermal energy and transfers
the heat to the dye in the immediate vicinity, thereby 
heating the dye to its vaporization temperature for
transfer to the receiver. The absorbing material may
be present in a layer beneath the dye and/or it may be
admixed with the dye. The laser beam is modulated by
electronic signals which are representative of the
shape and color of the original image, so that each dye
is heated to cause volatilization only in those areas
in which its presence is required on the receiver to
reconstruct the color of the original object. Further
details of this process are found in GB 2,083,726A.In one ablative mode of imaging by the action
of a laser beam, an element with a dye layer
composition comprising an image dye, an infrared-absorbing
material, and a binder coated onto a
substrate is imaged from the dye side. The energy
provided by the laser drives off the image dye at the
spot where
