<ABSTRACT>
A device for the vacuum-tight closing of containers closable by means of lids, in particular for the storage of perishable goods, such as foodstuffs, paints, etc., with a vacuum pump, is characterised by a container (2) which has a lid (10) for vacuum-tight closing, can be connected to the vacuum pump (28) and has a ventilating device (32) and into which the ventilatably designed containers (24) can be inserted. As a result, containers of versatile use can be closed inexpensively and simply in a vacuum-tight manner.
