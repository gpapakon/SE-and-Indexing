<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transparent, non-heat-sealable, oriented multilayer polyolefin film, which comprises a base layer containing polypropylene, and at least one non-heat-sealable top layer. The non-heat-sealable top layer contains from 0.1 to 0.6 % by weight of SiO2, based on the weight of the top layer, which has been organically aftertreated and has a mean particle diameter of from 2 to 6  mu m, preferably from 4 to 5  mu m. The invention also relates to a process for the production of the multilayer film and to the use of the film.

<CLAIMS>
A transparent, non-heat-sealable, oriented, 
multilayer polyolefin film comprising a base layer 

which contains polypropylene, and at least one non-heat-sealable 
outer layer, which contains from 0.1 

to 0.6% by weight of SiO
2
, wherein the SiO
2
 has been 
subjected to organic aftertreatment and has a coating 

which contains 0.5-5% of an aliphatic carboxylic 
acid, and wherein the SiO
2
 has a mean particle diameter 
of from 2 to 6 µm. 
A multilayer polyolefin film as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the aliphatic carboxylic acid is an 

aliphatic hydroxydicarboxylic acid or an aliphatic 
hydroxytricarboxylic acid or stearic acid. 
A multilayer polyolefin film as claimed in claim 1 
and/or 2, wherein the SiO
2
 has a citric acid-containing 
coating. 
A multilayer polyolefin film as claimed in one or 
more of claims 1 to 3, wherein the SiO
2
 has a mean 
particle diameter of from 2 to 5 µm, preferably 

4 µm. 
A process for the production of a multilayer 
polyolefin film as claimed in claim 1, in which the 

melts corresponding to the individual layers of the 
film are coextruded through a flat-film die, the 

coextruded film is taken off over a take-off roll  
 

whose temperature is between 80 and 110°C, the film 
is stretched biaxially with a longitudinal stretching 

ratio of from 4:1 to 7:1 and a transverse 
stretching ratio of from 8:1 to 10:1, and the biaxially 

stretched film is heat-set, if desired corona-treated 
and subsequently wound up. 
A laminate comprising a multilayer film as claimed 
in claim 1, and paper and/or cardboard. 
A method of using a multilayer polyolefin film as 
claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4 as a 

packaging film. 
A method of using a multilayer polyolefin film as 
claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4 for further 

processing, preferably for printing and/or 
lamination.
