<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine comprises one or more pairs of 
first and second cylinders (12, 14), the first cylinder (12) 

having a larger swept volume than the second cylinder (14) and 
respective first and second pistons (16, 18) reciprocable in 

the cylinders. The second piston (18) has a drive stem (234) 
and divides the second cylinder (14) into a first volume (15a) 

containing the drive stem of the second piston and a second 
volume (15b) between the two pistons. An air inlet (25) and 

an exhaust outlet (27) are provided for the first cylinder 
(12). A common combustion space (20) is formed between the 

pistons (16, 18) when the pistons are substantially at their 
inner dead centre positions, the combustion space comprising 

the second volume. A transfer means (39, 128, 391) enables 
gas flow between the first volume (15a) and the combustion 

space (20) towards the end of the compression stroke whilst an 
inhibiting means (128) inhibits the movement of fuel/air 

mixture from the first volume into the second volume until 
towards the end of the compression stroke of the second piston 

(18). A fuel injector (34) provides fuel to the first volume 
during the induction stroke of the second piston. The engine 

also has drive means for driving the second piston (18), the 
drive means including means for maintaining the second pis
ton 
(18) substantially at its inner dead centre position during at 

least a portion of the expansion stroke of the first piston 
(16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion 
engine. A "segregating engine" is an engine where the fuel does not 
begin to mix with the bulk of the air inducted by the engine 
until near the end of the compression stroke, just before 
ignition, and various internal combustion engines which can be 
classified as segregating engines are known, for example from 
GB-A-2155546, GB-A-2186913, GB-A-2218153, GB-A-2238830, GB-A-2246394 
and GB-A-2261028. Those engines are now known in the 
literature as the Merritt engines. The diesel engine is also a segregating engine whereas the 
spark ignition gasoline engine (SIGE) compresses a pre-mixed 
mixture of fuel and air. An important characteristic of segregating engines such as the 
diesel and Merritt engines is the confinement of the fuel, 
away from the air, until just before the moment of ignition, 
and the rapid delivery of the fuel into the combustion chamber 
near the end of the compression stroke. The Merritt engines use what is referred to as the Merritt 
combustion management system (MCC) which represents a sequence 
of processes designed to promote combustion in a reciprocating 
combustion engine. In this respect it is similar to the other 
generic combustion management systems, such as diesel and 
Otto, or SIGE. MCC can be operated by a number of devices 
which are described in the earlier patent specifications 
mentioned above. MCC is characterised by the segregation of 
at least part of the fuel supplied to the engine in a second, 
smaller cylinder containing some air having a smaller piston,  
 
and the introduction of the fuel into the smaller cylinder 
during the induction and/or compression strokes of the larger 
piston. The fuel remains segregated from the bulk of the air 
until ingression occurs, near the end of the compression 
strokes of both pistons. This arrangement allows the fuel 
appreciable time to vaporise in some air before combustion 
starts, in contrast with the diesel segregating engine where 
liquid fuel is first injected into air just before the moment 
of ignition. In the MCC system the smaller cylinder is used 
as a vaporising cylinder and the smaller piston is used as a 
fuel transfer piston. Hence the smaller cylinder can be 
referred to as the fuel management cylinder. The larger 
cylinder receives the air, unthrottled and without fuel, and 
the larger piston is used to compress the air. The following terms when used herein have the following 
meanings: The ratio of the quantity of fuel actually supplied to the

said first cylinder (12) to provide a preselected fuel/air 
ratio mixture in said first cylinder (12). 
A method as claimed in claim 61 wherein said preselected 
fuel/air mixture is substantially stoichiometric. 
A method as claimed in claim 60, 61 or 62 wherein 
the air inducted into said first cylinder (12) is throttled to 

control the end of compression temperatures and pressures to 
levels insufficient to cause compression ignition prior to the 

discharge of ignition energy into said combustion space (20).  
 
A method as claimed in any of claims 60 to 63 wherein 
said first preselected quantity of fuel is ignited by a spark 

to generate said ignition energy. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 60 to 63 wherein 
said first preselected quantity of fuel is ignited by 

compression ignition to generate said ignition energy. 
A method as claimed in claim 60 further comprising:
 
injecting a second preselected quantity of liquid fuel under 

high pressure into said combustion space (20) towards the end 
of the compression stroke of said second piston for ignition 

by compression ignition. 
A method as claimed in claim 66 wherein said first 
preselected quantity of fuel is injected into said first 

volume (15a) of said second cylinder (14) during the induction 
stroke of said second piston. 
A method as claimed in claim 66 or 67 wherein said second 
fuel is low octane or high cetane fuel and said first fuel is 

a volatile, higher octane fuel. 
A method as claimed in claim 68 wherein said first fuel 
is gasoline. 
A method as claimed in claim 68 wherein said second fuel 
is diesel fuel. 
A method as claimed in any of claims 60 to 70 wherein 
said second piston (18) undergoes an induction stroke over at 

least part of the exhaust and induction strokes of said first 
piston (16).  

 
A method as claimed in claim 71 wherein said second  
 

piston (18) undergoes an induction stroke over substantially 
all of the exhaust and induction strokes of said first piston 

(16). 
A method as claimed in any of claims 60 to 72 wherein the 
compression stroke of said second piston (18) takes place over 

substantially all of the compression stroke of said first 
piston (16). 
A method as claimed in any of claims 60 to 73 wherein 
said second piston (18) remains substantially stationary at 

its inner dead centre position over substantially all of the 
expansion stroke of said first piston (16). 
A method as claimed in any of claims 60 to 70 wherein 
said second piston (18) remains substantially stationary at 

its inner dead centre position over substantially all of the 
exhaust and expansion strokes of said first piston (16).
