<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a luminescent
panel for color video display used as picture
elements of a color video display apparatus, and its
driving system. The invention also relates to a color
video display apparatus utilizing the same.In a color video display apparatus capable of
displaying an image on a large screen, many luminescent
panels are arranged in two dimensions to form the large
screen. Each luminescent panel corresponds to one or
more picture elements. One type of the luminescent
panel utilizes a fluorescent lamp capable of efficiently
providing sufficient area brightness, which is disclosed
in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 2-129847, and its corresponding European Patent
Application EP-A-0,372,234. Referring to Figure 1, the
structure of such a luminescent panel 100 will be
described.The luminescent panel 100 has a cylindrical
container 2 housing a coil filament 1 serving as a
cathode, a casket 4 in which six discharge rooms 3a-3f
are partitioned, and a light-transmitting front plate
5. These constitute a hermetic container. Generally,
the coil filament 1 is a tungsten electrode on which an
oxide layer is formed. The oxide layer serves as an
emitter which emits thermoelectrons by a current flow.
Anodes 6a-6f are respectively provided in the discharge
rooms 3a-3f, and mixed gas of mercury vapor and rare 
gas is confined therein as discharge gas.A phosphor layer for emitting light (not
shown) is provided on an inner wall of the casket 4.
More specifically, for example, the phosphor layer in
the discharge rooms 3a and 3d is for green light, the
phosphor layer in the discharge rooms 3b and 3e is for
red light, and the phosphor layer in the discharge
rooms 3c and 3f is for blue light.The luminescent panel 100 is a hot cathode
type, and its specific mechanism for emitting light
will be described hereinafter.When an electric current flows through the
coil filament 1, thermoelectrons are emitted from the
oxide emitter formed on the surface of the coil filament
1. The thermoelectrons ignite discharge in the
discharge rooms. The discharge excites the mercury
vapor in the mixed gas confined in the discharge rooms
3a-3f so that ultraviolet light is generated. When the
ultraviolet light irradiates the phosphor layer on the
inner wall of the casket 4, light of a predetermined
color is emitted.By arranging the luminescent panels 100 in a
matrix, a color video display apparatus displaying
television images or the like can be constructed. In
this case, one picture element is constituted
