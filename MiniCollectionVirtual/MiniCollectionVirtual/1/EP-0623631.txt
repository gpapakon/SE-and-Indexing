<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for producing substituted 
acylating agents by the reaction of an enophile with an ene by the 

thermal route wherein (a) the molar ratio of the enophile to the ene 
is at least 3:1 and (b) the reaction pressure is rai
sed to above 20 
psig at least after addition of the enophile reaction to the 

reaction is completed and is maintained substantially constant until 
at least 80% of the ene reactant has been converted to the 

corresponding acylating agent. The agents so produced are 
substantially free of chlorine and can be further reacted with an 

amine or a hydroxy compound to form a derivative which can be used 
as an additive for a lubricating oil or a fuel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substituted acylating agents,
especially polybutenyl- substituted acylating agents and a process for
producing the same.It is well known to produce substituted acylating agents by reaction of an ene
compound such as polypropylene or polybutene with an enophile, eg maleic anhydride.
One such route, the so called "chlorination route" involves the use of chlorine to activate
the double bonds in the ene compound by forming the corresponding chlorinated
derivative and the chlorinated derivative so formed is subsequently functionalised by
reaction with the enophile such as maleic anhydride to form the substituted acylating
agent. This route is efficient and leads to high conversions to the substituted acylating
agent. However, a serious drawback is the problem of chlorine incorporation into the
substituted acylating agent which has become increasingly unacceptable, especially when
such agents are used in the production of lubricating oil or fuel additives.The other route is the so called "thermal route" in which the ene, eg a
polypropylene or a polybutene, and the enophile, eg maleic anhydride, are simply heated
up, optionally in the presence of a catalyst or other additive, in order to form the substituted
acylating agent. This route avoids the problem of chlorine incorporation encountered in
the chlorination route. One such process is described in the published EP-A-457599
which teaches the reaction of an enophile such as maleic anhydride with an ene such as a
polybutene in a mole ratio of less than 3:1, preferably less than 1.9:1 (page 3, lines 46-47).
In this publication, the preferred reaction pressure used is below 138 KPa (20 psi)
for a substantial period (at least the first three hours) after the commencement of the
reaction (all the Examples) and the reaction is carried out in the presence of a catalyst
such as aluminium trichloride. However, this thermal route generally gives lower
conversions and leaves an undesirably high level of unreacted polybutene in the 
substituted acylating agent so produced. This is of the order of 24-27%, after recycle of
the unreacted maleic anhydride, according to Example 9 of EP-A-457599. The high levels
of unreacted polybutenes are undesirable because they adversely affect the performance
of the lubricating oil or fuel additives produced therefrom.EP-A-355895 on the other hand describes a process for the production of
polyolefin substituted succinic anhydride derivatives which are essentially free from
chlorine by heating the
