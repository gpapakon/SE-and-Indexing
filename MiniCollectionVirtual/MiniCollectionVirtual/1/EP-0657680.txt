<ABSTRACT>
A tube coupling block (10) is disclosed for joining a 
plurality of male tube members (12) to a plurality of female 

tube members (14). The tube coupling block includes a main 
body (16) having a plurality of bores (38), each having a 

seat area (36) of predetermined shape, for receiving the 
first end (26) of the female tube member (14) therein as 

well as a generally planar second body (18) releasably 
secured to the main body and having a plurality of tube 

receiving slots (42). Each slot is configured to fit over a 
circumferential upset (22) of the male tube member (12) upon 

rotation of the second body (18) relative to the main body 
(16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to tube 
connections. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a tube coupling apparatus which eliminates the 
need for welding or soldering or the use of special tools to 
join a pair of tubes together. In many automotive, household appliance and machine 
tool applications, fluid conduits or tubes that carry 
pressurised fluids must be capable of being disconnected to 
permit repair or replacement of components of the system. 
To facilitate initial connection and subsequent 
disconnection, there have been proposed a myriad of quick-connect 
fittings or tube coupling devices such as 
exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 4,055,359, assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention. The device of the '359 
patent is very effective in providing a leak-tight seal 
between two fluid carrying tubes but requires the use of a 
special tool to disconnect the tubes when repair or service 
needs to be done. It would, therefore, be desirable to 
provide a tube coupling device which provides a leak-tight 
seal between adjacent tube members and which is economical 
and simple to use without the need for specialised tooling. U.S. Patent No. 4,468,054 discloses a flange mounted 
expansion valve utilising a tube coupling device which 
includes a flange plate having a pair of tube receiving 
notches formed on one edge thereof which fit over a pair of 
tubes. The plate is subsequently secured to the expansion 
valve by use of a threaded fastener. The fastener and the 
tube receiving slots prevent the flange plate from rotating 
relative to the expansion valve and provides a method to 
connect a pair or tubes to tie expansion valve. However, 
because the flange plate does not rotate relative to the 
valve, it is necessary for the tubes to first be inserted 
into the valve, then the flange plate to be slid over the 
tubes and subsequently the threaded fastener to be inserted  
 
into an aperture and tightened. In a constricted or 
confined work space, the ability of an operator to manoeuvre 
independent pieces of the expansion valve as such can be 
hindered due to the number of component pieces involved. It 
would, therefore, be desirable to provide a tube coupling 
device which can be utilised in a preassembled condition to 
reduce the number of loose components used during the 
joining of the tube members. The present invention provides a tube coupling 
apparatus for joining together a plurality of tube members 
which comprises a plurality of male tube members, each male 
tube

A tube coupling apparatus for joining together a 
plurality of tube members, comprising: 

   a plurality of male tube members (12), each male tube 
member (12) having a circumferential upset (22) spaced 

from a pilot end (24) thereof; 
   a plurality of female tube members (14) having a 

first end (26) with a circumferential flange (28) there 
around for receiving said pilot end (24) of said male tube 

members (12) therein; 
   a plurality of O-rings (40), each O-ring (40) being 

interposed between a respective upset (22) of said male 
tube member (12) and a 
flange of said female tube member 
(14);

each having a seat area (36) of predetermined shape for 

receiving the first end of said female tube members (14) 
therein, the circumferential flange (28) of said female 

tube member being configured to contact an exterior 
surface of said main body at said seat area (36); 

   a generally planar second body (18) releasably 
secured to said main body and having a plurality of tube 

receiving slots (42) therein, each slot being configured 
to fit over said circumferential upset (22) of a 

respective male tube member (12) upon rotation of said 
second body relative to said main body; and 

   a fastener (20) for securing said second body (18) to 
said main body (16). 
A tube coupling apparatus according to Claim 1, 
wherein said seat area of each of said bores of said main 

body includes a pair of spaced-apart shoulders. 
A tube coupling apparatus according to Claim 2, 
wherein said first end of said female tube members includes 

a pair of spaced-apart step portions configured to engage 
said pair of shoulders of said seat area. 
A tube coupling apparatus according to Claim 3, 
wherein said first end of said female tube members is staked 

into said seat area of said bores to prevent withdrawal 
therefrom. 
A tube coupling apparatus according to Claim 1, 
wherein said second body is generally S-shaped and said tube 

receiving slots open on opposite edges thereof. 
A tube coupling apparatus for joining together a 
plurality of tube members, comprising:
