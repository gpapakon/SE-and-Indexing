Method of separation and recuperation of the individual 
materials from old cables, consisting of several plastic-coated 

and/or metal-coated individual cables made of cable 
strands or solid cables, the following process steps being 

carried out:- 

sorting the cables (7,7') according to their suitability; 
if required, comminution (8) of the cables into 
manually manageable pieces; 
feeding the cables to a cable covering splitting 
machine (11) for splitting and removal of the outer 

plastic coating (5); 
 
characterized by the following further process steps: 


feeding the plastic-coated individual wires (2) with 
internally lying cable strand or solid cable to a 

plate comminuter (19) which chops the cable into 
platelets with a platelet thickness (a) of 3 to 10 mm; 
feeding the finely chopped cable platelets (22) to a 
vibrating screen (26) with a high frequency rate of 

short vibratory movement for the separation of the 
cable pieces or strand pieces (23) from the plastic 

coating (24) surrounding them. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
 
the further processing of the split off plastic coating 

(5, 14) in a cutter mill (15) into plastic granules (16). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
 
the plastic coating rings (24) removed from the vibrating  

 
screen (26) are treated in a cutter mill (15') mounted 

downstream. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
 
the comminuting machine (8) operates in the manner of a 

scissor-like cutter blade with fixed knife (9) and 
scissors (10). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
 
the cable covering splitting machine (11) has a corrugated 

roller (30) with a channel-shaped cable receiving profile 
(31), the outer cable coating (5) being splittable from 

above and below by two radially engaging blades (12, 13). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that
 
the plate comminuter (19) consists of a rotating cutter 

roller (20) or plate roller (20) of high centrifugal mass 
and speed, and in that the cutter blades (21) are arranged 

tangentially on the roller, and in that the cable (2) 
radially fed to the roller (20) is comminuted into platelets 

(22), the platelets formed from the cable strand having 
inner individual pieces (23) and an outer plastic ring (24) 

with a length of approximately 3 to 10 mm. 
A method according to claim 6, characterized in that
 
the continuous feeding of the cable (2) to the plate 

comminuter (19) is effected by means of a drivable 
corrugated roller (32).
