<ABSTRACT>
A rational method for obtaining a novel molecule capable of a desired interaction with a substrate of interest comprising selecting hosts or replicators which encode said novel molecules based upon cell or replicator growth caused by the desired interaction of the novel molecule and a selection molecule expressed by said host.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates broadly to rational
methods using recombinant genetic techniques and
selection to isolate, create or direct the evolution of
genes which express novel proteases having a desired
interaction with substrates of interest.More specifically, the invention relates to
methods for isolating, creating or evolving novel proteases
in industrial and therapeutic products.Even more specifically, the invention relates
to methods wherein host cells and/or viruses, which
express a modulated growth factor for the host or for the
virus functionally associated with a substrate of
interest or analog thereof, and multiple copies of a
putative novel protease or a multiplicity of putative
novel proteases which may interact with the substrate of
interest or analog to alter the activity of the growth
factor, are subjected to selection conditions or
evolutionary selection conditions to select for hosts or
viruses, or mutations thereof carrying the gene which
expresses the novel protease of interest.The methods of the invention can be used to
rationally create proteases having a wide range of
interesting properties 
, for a
variety of industrial, research or therapeutic uses.Several publications are referenced in this
application by Arabic numerals within parentheses. Full
citation for these references are found at the end of the
specification immediately preceding the claims. The
references more fully describe the state of the art to
which this invention pertains as well as certain aspects
of the invention itself.In general, there are three ways in which a
molecule with novel properties may be obtained. A first
method, e.g., protein engineering, reliefs on known
properties of a general type of molecule and upon
theoretical models which attempt to define the
conformation of molecules most likely to have the desired
properties. No models have proved general enough or
exact enough to reproducibly design appropriate
molecules.A second method is screening. screening
requires that multiple permutations of molecules be
tested for a given property. The current status of
screening technology and the vast number of different
permutations limits the usefulness of this technique.
For example, a peptide sequence of twenty amino acids has
2020 different permutations. To screen bacteria producing
different permutations of peptides of significant length,
billions upon billions of petri dishes, each on the order
of a thousand colonies, would be needed. To screen such
large populations to find those few members, if any,
which

<CLAIMS>
A method of mutating a first nucleic acid sequence encoding a putative peptide or protein
molecule into a second nucleic acid sequence encoding a second peptide or protein molecule,

which second peptide or protein molecule is a protease and is capable of binding to and
proteolytically cleaving a recognition sequence, said method comprising:-


(a) expressing multiple copies of the putative peptide or protein molecule encoded by said
first nucleic acid sequence in a population of host cells containing, as a single

polypeptide fusion protein:-

(i) a growth factor which is capable of conferring a growth advantage or
disadvantage upon the host cells or replicators within the host cells, said growth

factor being selected from the group consisting of nutrients, toxins, proteins
involved in host cell or replicator replication or metabolism, and proteins

involved in formation and maintenance of essential structural host cell or
replicator components; and
(ii) a recognition sequence comprising an amino acid sequence, said recognition
sequence providing a binding site to which the second peptide or protein binds

and catalytically cleaves;
(b) culturing the host cells and/or replicators under mutagenising and selective conditions
to ensure that:-


(i) at least one replicator and/or host cell in said population undergoes at least one
cycle of cell division and/or replication;
(ii) said first nucleic acid sequence is mutated to said second nucleic acid sequence
that encodes the second peptide or protein molecule;
(iii) said second peptide or protein molecule binds to the recognition sequence,
which binding proteolytically cleaves the recognition sequence and either up-modulates

the growth advantage conferred by the growth factor or down-modulates
the growth disadvantage conferred by the growth factor; and
(iv) a selective advantage is placed on those host cells containing the second peptide
or protein molecule and/or replicators within said host cells, thereby identifying

those host cells containing the second peptide or protein molecule and/or
replicators within said host cells.
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said growth factor is selected from the group
consisting of a cell growth factor and a replicator growth factor. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein said mutagenising and selection conditions are
imposed on the host cell population sequentially.
A method according to any of Claims 1-3 wherein said putative peptide or protein molecules
are homogeneous and/or said putative peptide or protein molecules are lacking the catalytic

binding activity of said second peptide or protein molecule.
A method according to any of Claims 1-3 wherein said second peptide or protein molecule has
a catalytic activity greater than that of said putative peptide or protein molecule.
