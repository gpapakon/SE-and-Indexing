<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor system for delicate items such as mushrooms has a roller-type of conveyor chain (10) arranged to run with its pin axes generally vertical. At spaced intervals along the chain are mounted support arms (13) projecting laterally from the chain. The chain-end of each arm has a re-entrant which resiliently embraces two rollers (18) of the chain, and allows the arm to release from the chain in the event of an obstruction. At the other end, each arm is bifurcated to define two limbs (36 and 37). One limb has a surface which is resiliently movable away from the confronting surface of the other limb.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally concerns conveyor systems.
In particular, the invention relates to a conveyor chain
suitable for carrying articles along a path along which
the conveyor chain is constrained to run, and also
relates to an arm for use in a conveyor system, to
support an article to be conveyed.A conveyor chain according to the preamble of claim
1 is known from US-A-2806498.There have been innumerable designs of conveyor
systems employing a chain adapted to support and convey
the articles to be carried by the conveyor system, from
one point to another. The chains used in such a system
are either specially designed and constructed for the
intended purpose, or comprise conventional chains which
have been modified for example by welding or otherwise
affixing components to the chain so as to render the
chain suitable for carrying the articles. Not
infrequently, a chain conveyor may jam, perhaps on
account of an article being improperly carried or
falling off the conveyor, so leading to a blockage, and
this very often results in damage to the conveyor chain.
The repair of the chain will then result in the conveyor
system being non-operational for a while, and may
require the replacement of a length of the claim.It is a principal aim of the present invention to
provide a conveyor system which is less prone to damage
in the event of a blockage or jam, caused by an
obstruction in the path of the supports for articles to
be carried, by appropriately configuring the conveyor
chain and the interconnection with each support.According to this invention, there is provided a 
conveyor chain
of the above-mentionned type which is characterised
by the features of the second part of claim 1.It will be appreciated that a chain constructed
and arranged as described has a plurality of supports
for articles to be conveyed, which supports are
connected to the chain in such a way that the supports
are able automatically to release themselves from the
chain in the event of there being an obstruction in the
path of advancement of those supports. Such an
obstruction could comprise articles which should have
been conveyed and yet which have fallen from the
supports, a mall-function of a mechanism for loading
articles on to the supports or removing them from the
supports, or even a human operator - in which latter
case injury to the operator will also be minimised.At least the end portion of each support, but
preferably the entire support, may be moulded from a
plastics material which exhibits sufficient resiliency
to permit

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor chain (10) comprising a series of links (11, 12)
each having a pair of parallel spaced side plates with

the plates of one link pivoted to the plates of the
next adjacent link by a respective pin extending

transversely to the length of the chain, and a
plurality of supports (13) for articles to be conveyed

spaced along the length of the chain, each support
being releasably coupled to the chain and projecting

laterally thereof, each support (13) comprising an arm
adapted to support an article to be conveyed and having

at one end portion chain engagement means (35)
characterised in that said engagment means (35) comprise

a single
re-entrant opening (38) the maximum internal width of

which is such that two adjacent pins of the chain may
be accommodated therein, at least the part (35) of the arm

defining the opening (38) being resiliently deformable arm
permit the arm to be sprung on to and off a pair of

adjacent pins.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in Claim 1, wherein
at least the end portion of the arm (13) defining the chain

engagement means (35) is moulded from a plastics material
which exhibits sufficient resiliency to permit the arm

to be sprung on and off a pair of chain pins.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in Claim 2,
wherein the entire arm (13) is moulded from a plastics

material.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in any of Claims 1
to 3, wherein the end portion (35) of the arm (13) is a close fit

between the side plates of the chain whereby the arm is
supported thereby.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in any of Claims 1
to 4, wherein the opening (38) is generally C-shaped.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in any of Claims 1
to 5, wherein each link which is to carry an article

support has an external third side plate disposed 
parallel to and spaced from said pair of side plates of

that link, the pins associated with that link being
extended and carrying the third side plate, and the

article support means (13) being mounted on the portions of
the two pins disposed between the third side plate and

the adjacent side plate of the pair thereof of that
link.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in any of Claims 1
to 6, wherein each pin of the chain carries a rotatable

roller (18) disposed between the side plates, and the chain
engagement means (35) of each arm (13) has an internal width

sufficient to accommodate two adjacent pins together
with the rollers (18) of those pins.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in any of Claims 1
to 7, wherein the other end portion of the arm remote

from the chain engagement means is bifurcated so as to
define two limbs (36, 37) upon which an article may be supported

with a part of the article projecting downwardly
between the two limbs.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in any of Claims 1
to 8, wherein at least one of said arms is bifurcated

at its other end to define two limbs (36, 37; 45, 46) upon which an
article may be supported with a part of the article

projecting downwardly between the two limbs, the two
limbs having respective limb surfaces which generally

confront one another and the limb surface of at least
one limb (36, 45) being resiliently deformable away from the

other limb surface, whereby said part of an article of
a sufficient size on being moved into the gap between

the two limb surfaces may resiliently deform said at
least one limb surface so as thereby to urge the part

of the article against the other limb surface.
A conveyor chain as Claimed in Claim 9, wherein
the limb surface of said at least one limb (45) is defined

by a strip of a resilient material (47) lining the
respective limb of the arm.
