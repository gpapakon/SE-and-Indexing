<ABSTRACT>
In a light emitting device made of a group II-VI semiconductor, 
a P-type interface film (15) including one or two layers 

is formed between the positive electrode (12) and the uppermost 
P-type layer (7) of the group II-VI semiconductor film (2), to 

make the energy band increase in steps from the electrode (12) 
to the semiconductor film (2), thereby realizing a structure 

where the current flows at a low voltage. The II-VI semiconductor 
film (2) is MBE-grown at a substrate temperature of 

350°C or below. The P-type interface film (15) is formed to 
have a carrier concentration of 10¹
⁹/cm³ or above by MBE growth 
at a substrate temperature lower than or equal to the substrate 

temperature at which the semiconductor film (2) is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor light
emitting device and its manufacturing method, said light
emitting device being used as a semiconductor laser device, as
a blue light emitter which is one of the elements of a display
panel for use in displays of various electronic apparatuses, as
a blue light emitting device (LED) used individually in a
display apparatus, as a signal reading and writing light
emitting device for use in a compact disk (CD) player, a laser
disk (LD) player and a magnetic optical disk player, and as a
light emitting device for use in a bar code reader.Fig. 1 schematically shows the basic structure of a
semiconductor laser device which is a kind of such a semiconductor
light emitting device, and the condition of a corresponding
energy band. The general structure of the semiconductor
laser device is as follows: a semiconductor film B is formed
on the surface of an N-type semiconductor substrate A by MBE
(molecular beam epitaxy)-growing an N-type semiconductor layer
B1, an active layer B2 and a P-type semiconductor layer B3 in
this order, and light is emitted from the active layer B2 by
applying a bias voltage in a forward direction between a metal
electrode E1 formed on the reverse surface of the substrate A and
a metal electrode E2 formed on the obverse surface of the P-type 
semiconductor layer B3 which is the top surface of the semiconductor
film B, i.e. from the electrode E2 to the electrode E1.As well known, the energy band of the semiconductor laser
device of the above-described structure is of a configuration
such that the energy levels of the N-type semiconductor layer B1
and the P-type semiconductor layer B3 are high and that an energy
level trough is formed at the active layer B2 which is a P-N
junction. An energy barrier ΔV is generated between the electrodes
E1 and E2 and the semiconductor film B.Therefore, when a voltage necessary to obtain a current I
which causes holes h to go over the energy barrier ΔV is applied
between the electrodes E1 and E2, the carriers i.e. holes h and
electrons injected by the voltage application are shut up in the
active layer B2 where the energy level is low, so that an induced
emission occurs vigorously. When the exciting current exceeds
a threshold value, light resonates between the parallel end
surfaces of the active layer B2 to cause a laser oscillation.Fig. 2 shows an example of a more specific structure of a
conventional semiconductor laser device. The device shown in
this figure is what is called a blue light emitting
