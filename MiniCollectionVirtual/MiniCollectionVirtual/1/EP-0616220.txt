Apparatus for determining the flow velocity and flow 
direction of gases or liquids with the aid of a temperature-dependent 

resistor (22) as measurement probe, which 
is disposed in the interior of a hollow body (3) between 

two mutually opposite openings (6, 7) at the end of a 
rotatable holding tube (24), wherein the openings (6, 7) 

have different cross sections which are such that, with 
perpendicular flow through the openings (6, 7) in the one 

direction relative to the angle of rotation with respect 
to the flow direction, a relative maximum of the velocity 

indication is obtained which has a value other than that 
in the opposite direction for the same flow velocity.
 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the hollow body (3) is formed as a cylindrical tube 

section. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the two openings (6, 7) are formed ovally and extend 

parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tube section 
(3). 
Apparatus according to either of claims 2 or 3, 
characterized in that a protective sleeve (4) which can 

be moved to a limited extent rests in a form-fitting 
manner on the tube section (3). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the two openings (6, 7) have an  

 
identical longitudinal extension, but a different transverse 

extension. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the relative maximum of the velocity 

indication is calibrated for perpendicular flow entry 
through the smaller (6) of the openings as flow velocity 

measured value. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a marking (26) is provided on the 

holding tube (24) for the purpose of determining 
direction.
