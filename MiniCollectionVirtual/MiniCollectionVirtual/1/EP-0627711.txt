<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bank note transporting 
apparatus in a game machine island in which bank notes inserted 
into a bank note inserting slot as a game playing fee can be 
supplied to a bank note transporting path in a position along the 
length thereof via a bank note identifying machine and can be 
transported from one side to the other side of the path. A plurality of game machine rows (hereinafter referred to as 
"game machine island") comprising a plurality of game machines 
and a plurality of game media lending machines for lending game 
media which are used for playing games by game players are 
disposed in game parlors. When a game player plays a game, he or 
she rents game media by inserting bank notes into a game media 
lending machine as a game playing fee. The bank notes which 
were inserted into the game media lending machine are accepted 
into the island and are then collected to a destination position, 
such as one end of the island. As a means thereof, a bank note 
transporting apparatus is provided in the island. The bank note transporting apparatus includes a unit for  
 
merging the bank notes which are inserted from the game media 
lending machine. Such a type of mechanism is incorporated in the 
transporting apparatus and per se is not easily disassembled. Jamming of the bank notes in the bank note merging unit is 
liable to occur due to the complicated structure and inappropriate 
timing of merging of the bank notes, etc. In the event of jamming 
of the bank notes, the game media lending machine is unable to be 
used and game players are considerably inconvenienced. The inside of a conventional bank note transporting apparatus, 
including the bank note merging unit is not easily accessible. In 
the event of jamming or other failures, it takes an extended 
period of time to conduct repair service such as removal of the 
jammed bank notes. WO-A-92 20 600 discloses a banknote 
transporting apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. It is an object of the present invention to provide a bank note 
conveying apparatus in which a unit for merging bank notes to a 
main transporting path can be easily opened to rapidly deal with 
jamming or failure therein. In order to accomplish the above mentioned object, according to 
the present invention, there is provided a bank note 
transporting apparatus for transporting externally inserted bank 
notes, which is provided in a game machine island in which a 
plurality of game machines and a plurality of game media lending 
machines
</DESCRIPTION>
