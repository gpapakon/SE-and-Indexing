<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a threaded closure for a container, including a safety ring (1) fastened to a lid (9) which can be fixed to the neck of the container, the said lid comprising a bottom and a side skirt, the inner wall of which includes closure ramps (14) which form threading and are provided in order to interact with corresponding closure ramps (18) mounted on the outer part of the neck of the container, in which the safety ring includes an internal rim bearing against the lower edge of the skirt of the lid and including at least one locking tab (4) and at least two snap-fastening tabs (5), the locking tab (4) bearing, in the closed position of the lid, against a rim of the neck of the container, located under the closure ramps and the snap-fastening tab being locked in a circular groove provided in the lower inner part of the skirt of the lid.

A screwthreaded closure for containers comprising a 
security ring (1) integral with a cover (9) designed to 

be fixed to the neck (17) of the container, the cover 
comprising a base (10) and a lateral skirt (11) of which 

the inner wall comprises closure ramps (14) forming a 
screwthread and designed to cooperate with corresponding 

closure ramps (18) disposed on the outer part of the neck 
of the container, in which the security ring (1) comprises 

a lower rim (3) bearing against the lower edge of 
the skirt of the cover, characterized in that the security 

ring (1) comprises at least one locking lug (4) and at 
least two detent lugs (5), the locking lug (4) - in the 

closed position of the cover - bearing against a flange 
(21) of the neck of the container situated beneath the 

closure ramps and the detent lug (5) being locked in a 
circular groove (15) formed in the lower inner part of 

the skirt of the cover and in that the locking lugs (4) 
and detent lugs (5) are alternately distributed around 

the circumference of the ring (1). 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the security ring (1) comprises a 

collar integral with the lower rim (3) and following the 
shape of the lower outer wall of the skirt (11) of the 

cover. 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the locking lugs (4) and detent 

lugs (5) project obliquely inwards and upwards. 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that each locking lug (4) and 

detent lug (5) is formed by at least one tongue, the 
locking tongue being longer than the detent tongue. 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that the security ring (1) 

comprises three locking lugs (4) and three detent lugs  
 

(5) uniformly distributed around its circumference. 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that, between each locking lug 

(4) and detent lug (5), the security ring comprises at 
least one slot (8) forming a weakened zone for the ring, 

the locking lug being formed by a tongue. 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that each locking lug (4) is 

formed by two tongues (25), a slot (26) forming a weakened 
zone being provided between the two tongues. 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 6, characterized in that each detent lug (5) comprises 

a retaining tongue (20) engaging in the circular 
groove (15) in the inner lower part of the skirt (11) of 

the cover. 
A screwthreaded closure as claimed in any of claims 
1 to 7, characterized in that the security ring (1) is in 

one piece and is made of polystyrene. 
A snap-on closure for containers comprising a 
security ring (30) integral with a cover designed to be 

fixed to the neck of the container, the cover comprising 
a base and a lateral skirt of which the inner wall 

comprises coupling means designed to cooperate with a 
flange on the outside of the neck of the container, in 

which the security ring comprises a lower rim (31) 
bearing against the lower edge of the skirt of the cover, 

characterized in that the security ring (30) comprises at 
least one locking lug (32) and at least two detent lugs 

(34), the locking lug (32) - in the closed position of 
the cover - bearing against the flange on the outside of 

the neck of the container and the detent lug (34) being 
locked onto a serration provided in the lower inner part 

of the skirt of the cover and in that the locking lugs 
(32) and detent lugs (34) are alternately distributed 

around the circumference of the ring (30).  
 
A security ring for the closure claimed in any of 
claims 1 to 10, characterized in that it comprises a rim 

(3,31) with at least one locking lug (4,32) and at least
