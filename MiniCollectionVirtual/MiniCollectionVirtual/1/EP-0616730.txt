<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a surface emitting light 
emitting diode (LED) with a PN junction between two semiconductor 
layers, of which at least one is active, the diode 
being adapted to emit light through a predetermined exit 
surface. By a surface emitting LED is meant an LED which is designed 
such that at least the main part of the emitted light is 
emitted from the diode through an exit surface which is 
substantially parallel to the PN junctions of the diode. By 
the concept LED is meant a semiconductor device with an 
active layer adjoining a PN junction. When current is 
conducted through the diode, charge carriers are injected 
into the active layer, and upon recombination of the charge 
carriers, light is emitted. The wavelength of the emitted 
light is determined by the energy gap of the material in the 
active layer, and the wavelength is inversely proportional 
to this energy gap. Figure 1a shows an example of an LED of the above kind. The 
material therein may, for example, be GaAlAs. The semiconductor 
body comprises four layers 1-4. The layers 1 and 
2 are P-doped and the layers 3 and 4 N-doped. In the layers 
1 and 3 the material has a higher energy gap than in the 
layer 2. The layer 2 constitutes the active layer of the 
diode. The energy gap of the material may be controlled by 
variation of the aluminium content of the material. A PN 
junction 6 is formed between the layers 2 and 3. The layer 
1 is provided with a contact 5a and the layer 4 with an 
annular contact 5b for supply of current to the diode. The 
layer 4 has a centrally arranged well which extends down to 
the exit surface 7. When current traverses the PN junction, 
charge carriers are injected, which substantially recombine  
 
in the active layer 2, whereby light is emitted. The main 
part of the light is emitted through the exit surface 7, and 
the emitted light is in Figure la symbolically shown with 
the aid of the arrow designated hν. Figure 1b illustrates the energy gap Eg for the layers 1-3 
as a function of z, where z is the distance along the normal 
direction to the exit surface 7. The layers 1 and 3 have 
the equally large energy gaps Eg1 and Eg3, respectively, 
which are greater than the energy gap EgA of the active 
layer 2. The layer 1 may, for example, have the thickness 2 µm, the 
layer 2 the thickness 2 µm, and the layer 3 the thickness 10 
µm. Figure 1c shows the intensity Pλ of the emitted light as a 
function of its wavelength λ. The intensity maximum occurs 
at the wavelength λp. The
