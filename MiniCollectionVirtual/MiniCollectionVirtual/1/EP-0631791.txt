<ABSTRACT>
A vascular catheter 1 is used for intravascular 
surgical operation, highly localized injection of medicine 

such as anticancer drugs, and angiography. 
The main portion 6 of the catheter body 2 is made up of 
an inner tube 4 formed of a synthetic resin and an outer 

tube 5 formed of a synthetic resin covering the outside 
surface of the inner tube 4. The tip portion 7 of the 

catheter body 2 is made up of a portion of the outer tube 
extending from the distal end of the inner tube. The inner 

tube 4 has a groove 9A, slot 9B or slits 9C or a number of 
microholes 71 formed in the distal end portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vascular catheter
used for intravascular surgical operation, highly localized
injection of medicine such as anticancer drugs, and
angiography.Medical treatment using vascular catheters is
developing to smaller and smaller blood vessels as from the
heart to the brain. Lesions of the brain blood vessels are
aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation (AVM) and dural
arteriovenous fistula (DAVF), for example. Demand for a
vascular catheter for treating or examining such lesions of
blood vessels is more and more increasing.A vascular catheter for this purpose must be inserted
to the intended part of a blood vessel being passed in
complicatedly bent or branched blood vessels.For an intravascular surgical operation called
emboluation technique conducted for treating lesions in the
brain blood vessels such as aneurysm and arteriovenous
malformation, for example, the distal end of a small-diameter
vascular catheter is inserted to or near the
lesions in the brain. Then, a liquid embolizing material
such as cyanoacrylate or dimethylsulfoxide solution of
ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, a granular embolizing
material such as granules of poly(vinyl alcohol) or a
expanding member such as coil is injected from the distal
end of the catheter. For such a small-diameter vascular catheter, high
manipulability to insert it easily and quickly up to a
target lesion passing in complicatedly bent or branched
small blood vessel is required in addition to the chemical
and biological safety required for common vascular
catheters.To have high manipulability, a small-diameter vascular
catheter must have the following four properties.The first property is that the catheter can convey the
pushing force in the direction of the axis added to the
proximal end portion by the operator up to the distal end or
has so called pushability.The second property is that the catheter can convey the
turning force around the axis added to the proximal end
portion up to the distal end or has so called turnability.The third property is that the catheter can be advanced
in blood vessels along the guide wire inserted beforehand
easily and without causing damage to the wall of the blood
vessels or has so called pliability.The fourth property is that the catheter does not kink
at bents (curves and crooks) in blood vessels after the
guide wire is removed or has reluctance to kinking.A vascular catheter having a catheter body of the
double-tube structure made up of a comparatively rigid inner
tube and a comparatively soft and

A vascular catheter (1,30,40,50) comprising a flexible slender
catheter body (2) which is made up of an comparatively rigid inner tube (4) formed of a

synthetic resin and a comparatively soft and flexible outer tube (5) formed of a synthetic
resin covering the outside surface of the inner tube (4) and has

a main portion (6), tip portion (7) and a lumen (3),

said main portion (6) of said catheter body being made up of
said inner tube and said outer tube,
said tip (7) of said catheter body being made up of the
portion of said outer tube (5) which extends from the distal end

of said inner tube (4), characterized in that
at least one helical groove (9A,31) helical slot (9B,51) or helical slit
is formed in the inside surface of the distal end portion of the

inner tube (4)
extending from or from near the distal end to an appropriate

position in the direction of the axis so as to increase flexibility
of the distal end portion of the inner tube (4).

tube (5) is formed of a synthetic resin softer than the

synthetic resin of which said inner tube (4) is formed.
The vascular catheter of claim 1 or 2 wherein said
synthetic resin for both or either one of said inner and

outer tubes is a synthetic resin elastomer.
The vascular catheter of any preceding claim wherein the pitch of 
said helical groove, helical slot or helical slit becomes

gradually smaller toward the distal end.
The vascular catheter of any preceding claim wherein the width of
said helical groove, helical slot or helical slit becomes

gradually greater toward the distal end.
The vascular catheter of any preceding claim wherein said catheter
is a brain blood vessel catheter.

slot or slit forms a space in said inner tube. 
A vascular catheter comprising a flexible slender catheter
body which is made up of a comparatively rigid inner tube (4) formed
