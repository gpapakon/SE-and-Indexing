<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a differential protective system for electric power transmission paths in which measurement quantities (M1, M2, M3) obtained from the  currents (J1, J2, J3) at each end of the section (1) to be monitored are digitised and subjected to digital sine filtering (10). Sign signals (Vp(t), Vn(t), Gp(t), Gn(t)) are obtained from auxiliary measured quantities (i*(t)) formed from the filtered current measurement values (is(t)) and taken to both ends of the section (1) to be monitored for evaluation with the formation of an exciting signal (SM(t)). To make the system largely unaffected by frequency variations in the currents (J1, J2, J3), further filtered current measurement values (ic(t)) are obtained by cosine filtering; from them and from the individual filtered current measurement values (is(t)), by the establishment of a valve and by low-pass filtering (20), a measurement quantity relative to this valve (iBE(t)) is formed, by means of which a further exciting quantity (SB(t)) is established using a comparison quantity relative to this value (i*B(t)). If both exciting signals (Vp(t), Vn(t), Gp(t), Gn(t)) are evaluated.

Method for obtaining a tripping signal through 
the comparison of currents (J1, J2, J3) at the ends of 

a section (1) of an electrical power transmission path 
to be monitored, where at each end of the section (1) 

to be monitored, in a phase-selective manner 

measured variables (M1, M2, M3) obtained from the 
currents (J1, J2, J3) are in each case subjected 

to an analog-to-digital conversion (9) while 
obtaining digital current measured values (J(t)), 

from which subsequently current measured values 
(i
S
(t)) filtered by digital sine filtering (10) 
are obtained, 
from the respectively present filtered current 
measured value (i
s
(t)) a stored current reference 
measured value (for example i
s
(t - 2 T) is 
subtracted with the formation of a respective 

auxiliary measured variable (i*(t)), 
a sign signal (V
p
(t), V
n
(t)) characterizing the 
sign of the respective auxiliary measured variable 

(i*(t)) is on the one hand prepared for an 
evaluation at the respective one end and on the 

other hand is transmitted by way of a data 
transmission path (13) for evaluation at the 

respective other end of the section (1) to be 
monitored, and 
a starting variable (S
M
(t)) enabling the 
respective evaluation is generated if the 

auxiliary measured variable (i*(t)) lies in 
absolute-value-related manner above a given 

threshold value, 
 
characterized in that at each end of the section to be 

monitored 

the digital current measured values (J(t)) are 
subjected to a digital cosine filtering (19) while 

obtaining additional filtered current measured  
 

values (i
c
(t)), 
an absolute-value measured variable (i
BF
(t)) is 
formed from the one and the additional filtered 

current measured values (i
s
(t), i
c
(t)) through 
absolute-value formation and low-pass filtering, 
from the respectively present absolute-value 
measured variable (i
BF
(t)) a stored absolute-value 
reference measured variable (for example i
BF
(t-2T)) 
is subtracted with the formation of an 

absolute-value comparison variable (i*
B
(t)), 
the absolute-value comparison variable (i*
B
(t)) is 
compared with a given limiting value (J
Bthreshold
) 
and an additional starting variable (S
B
(t)) is 
generated if the absolute-value comparison 

variable (i*
B
(t)) lies in absolute-value-related 
manner above the limiting value (J
Bthreshold
), and 
with the presence of both starting variables 
(S
M
(t), S
B
(t)) the evaluation of the sign signals 
(V
p
(t), V
n
(t)) and the corresponding sign signals 
(G
p
(t), G
n
(t)) from the other end of the section 
(1) to be monitored is carried out. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that an absolute-value measured variable (i
BF
(t - 2T)) 
lying behind by two periods of the current is used as 

absolute-value reference measured variable if this 
absolute-value measured variable (i
BF
(t - 2 T)) is 
smaller than a given absolute-value limiting value 

(J
Blimit
), and the given absolute-value limiting value 
(J
Blimit
) is used as absolute-value reference measured 
variable if the absolute-value measured variable 

(i
BF
(t - 2 T)) is larger than the given absolute-value 
limiting value (J
Blimit
). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the one starting variable (S
M
(t)) 
is suppressed if the difference (Jd) between a present 

digital current measured value (J(t)) and a preceding  
 

stored digital current measured value lies below a 
given minimum value.
