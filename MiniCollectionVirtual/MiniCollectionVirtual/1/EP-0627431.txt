<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process for the preparation 
of the crystalline monohydrate form of the compound of the 

formula (I) 

 
which comprises the step of mixing a form of loracarbef, other 
than the crystalline monohydrate, such as the ethanol crystal, 

acetone crystal, crystalline dihydrate, acetonitrile crystal, 
methanol crystal, propanol crystal, ethyl acetate crystal, 

methylene chloride crystal, crystalline bis(DMF) and crystalline 
mono(DMF) form, in water at a temperature between about 30°C to 

about 60°C, and preferably at a temperature between 40°C and 
50°C. Conversion may also be accomplished by exposing the 

loracarbef form to saturated steam at a temperature of between 
about 90° to about 100°C. Another aspect of the invention is 

the preparation of the above mentioned crystal forms by 
slurrying the bis(DMF)solvate form of the compound of formula 

(I) with the respective solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation 
of a crystalline monohydrate form of a carbacephalosporin. The β-lactam antibiotic of the formula (I), 
 
is the potent orally active antibiotic known as loracarbef. The 
antibiotic is described, for example by J. Hashimoto, et al., in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,335,211, issued June 15, 1982. The above compound comes in various forms, including the 
crystalline monohydrate form, which is disclosed in European 
Patent Publication 0,311,366 having a publication date of April 
12, 1989. The crystalline dihydrate form of the compound is 
disclosed in European Patent Publication 369,686 published May 23, 
1990. Other known solvate forms of the compound are disclosed in 
Eckrich et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,977,257. As set out in the 
Eckrich et al. patent, the crystalline monohydrate form of 
loracarbef may be derived from the loracarbef bis(DMF)solvate.  
 
The procedure for such conversion involves dissolving the 
loracarbef bis(DMF)solvate in water, adding hydrochloric acid 
followed by triethylamine. The crystalline monohydrate is then 
filtered from the mixture. This particular process is hampered 
by the inefficient removal of residual dimethylformamide (present 
in the intermediate loracarbef bis(DMF)solvate), and triethylamine 
(used to crystallize loracarbef monohydrate) from the crystals 
slow filtration and wash difficulties. It has been determined that loracarbef crystalline 
monohydrate, which is a fine "hair-like" crystal, apparently forms 
a mat on the filter medium which prevents or reduces the ability 
to remove the occluded solvent and base. In order to obtain 
acceptable levels of the DMF and triethylamine it has been 
necessary to wash the crystals with water one or more times. 
Since loracarbef monohydrate is moderately soluble in water 
(approximately 10 mg/ml) significant yield losses result when such 
reslurries are needed. Added to this is the slow filterability in 
general of the monohydrate. In light of the above difficulties, what is needed is a 
process which avoids not only the need to use acids and bases to 
produce the monohydrate, but also avoids the requirement for 
filtration, requiring only a dry down to produce the monohydrate. The invention provides a process for the preparation of 
the crystalline monohydrate form of the compound of the formula 
(I)  
 
 
which comprises the step of mixing crystalline a form of loracarbef other than 
the crystalline monohydrate, selected from the ethanol crystal, acetone 
crystal,
