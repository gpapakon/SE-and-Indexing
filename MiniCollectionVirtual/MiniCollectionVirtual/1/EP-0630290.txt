<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to
a process for preparing
a catalyst
for shape selective conversions such as the conversion
of toluene to para-xylene.The term shape-selective catalysis describes
unexpected catalytic selectivities in zeolites. The
principles behind shape selective catalysis have been
reviewed extensively, e.g. by N.Y. Chen, W.E. Garwood
and F.G. Dwyer, "Shape Selective Catalysis in
Industrial Applications," 36, Marcel Dekker, Inc.
(1989). Within a zeolite pore, hydrocarbon conversion
reactions such as paraffin isomerization, olefin
skeletal or double bond isomerization, oligomerization
and aromatic disproportionation, alkylation or
transalkylation reactions are governed by constraints
imposed by the channel size. Reactant selectivity
occurs when a fraction of the feedstock is too large
to enter the zeolite pores to react; while product
selectivity occurs when some of the products cannot
leave the zeolite channels. Product distributions can
also be altered by transition state selectivity in
which certain reactions cannot occur because the
reaction transition state is too large to form within
the zeolite pores or cages. Another type of
selectivity results from configurational diffusion
where the dimensions of the molecule approach that of
the zeolite pore system. A small change in dimensions
of the molecule or the zeolite pore can result in
large diffusion changes leading to different product
distributions. This type of shape selective catalysis
is demonstrated, for example, in the selective
disproportionation of toluene to p-xylene.Para-xylene is a very valuable commercial product
useful in the production of polyester fibers. The
catalytic production of para-xylene has received much
attention in the scientific community and various 
methods for increasing catalyst para-selectivity have
been described.The synthesis of para-xylene is typically
performed by methylation of toluene in the presence of
a suitable catalyst. Examples are the reaction of
toluene with methanol as described by Chen et al., J.
Amer. Chem. Sec. 1979, 101, 6783, and toluene
disproportionation, as described by Pines in "The
Chemistry of Catalytic Hydrocarbon Conversions",
Academic Press, N.Y., 1981, p. 72. Such methods
typically result in the production of a mixture
including para-xylene, ortho-xylene, and meta-xylene.
Depending upon the para-selectivity of the catalyst
and the reaction conditions, different percentages of
para-xylene are obtained. The yield, i.e., the amount
of feedstock actually converted to xylene,
