<ABSTRACT>
The wing of the invention with a span (b) has a main section (1) which has a virtually closed surface in relation to the flow (v) and has an end section at its free end in the form of a wing grid. The wing grid has at least two parallel and mutually staggered winglets (2). As part of the span (b) of the wing, such a wing grid assumes the contour circulation at the joint with the main section and distributes it virtually evenly to the winglets. Thus the circulation distribution for the wing becomes more complete with a lower induced resistance. An upper or lower limit for the effect is set depending on whether a rectangular circulation distribution is generated by the attached wing grid for the entire wing or only for the part of the full span replaced by the wing grid. Thus, in a wing with a wing grid, there is a corresponding reduction in the induced resistance by comparison with a conventional wing without a wing grid for the same resulting lateral ratio.

Wing with a main part (1), which has a closed surface round which there is 
a flow and at its end remote from the fixing side a profile chord (t) having a 

specific length and a wall (3) positioned parallel to said profile chord, and 
having a wing grid, which is attached to said end of the main part and comprises 

at least two parallel winglets (2), the winglets (2) having substantially 
the same orientation as the main part (1), characterized in that the 

winglets (2) of the wing grid are staggered in a staggering direction (O) in 
such a way that by a co
rresponding determination of the total lift of the wing 
grid per length unit of the span width (b) in the design point, the circulation 

round the wing grid is the same as the circulation round the profile of the 
main part (1) at the joining point of the wing grid and in such a way that 

said circulation along the profile chord (t) can be zonally taken over by the 
winglets. 
Wing according to claim 1, characterized in that the winglets (2) are 
distortion-free. 
Wing according to claim 2, characterized in that the wing grid as a whole 
or individual winglets can be extended from the main part (1). 
Wing according to one of the claims 2 and 3, characterized in that the wing 
grid has a holding frame (4) through which the winglets (2) are interconnected 

at their free ends. 
Wing according to one of the claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the wing 
grid at the design point has fixed grid parameters individually defined for 

each winglet, at least for the profile chord (c), setting angle (β) and stagger 
distance (s). 
Wing according to one of the claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the 
setting angle (β) of the winglets (2) in the wing grid is jointly variable by 

identical amounts starting from the design point. 
Wing according to one of the claims 2 to 6, characterized in that through  
 

the rotation of the complete wing grid the setting angle of the winglets can be 
modified. 
Wing according to one of the claims 2 to 7, characterized in that the 
winglets have a sweepback to the incident flow (v) like the main part (1) 

corresponding to the same Mach number. 
Wing according to one of the claims 2 to 8, characterized in that the 
furthest forward or furthest back winglet in the wing grid can be individually 

adjusted. 
Use of the wing according to one of the claims 1 to 9 for a boat having a 
main sail (1), whose upper edge is provided with a sail grid.
