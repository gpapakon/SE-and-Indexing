<ABSTRACT>
A needle-syringe assembly, operable in a normal mode and convertible to a 
retraction mode, comprises an elongated, generally cylindrical barrel, a plunger 

slidably mounted in the barrel, and a needle holder carrying a hollow needle on the 
distal end thereof. The barrel forms a hollow nozzle located at the distal end of the 

barrel. The plunger forms a coaxial cavity extending therethrough, and the plunger 
includes a helical slot exposing a proximal portion of the coaxial cavity. The needle 

holder is slidably mounted in the coaxial cavity of the plunger. During the normal 
mode, a distal portion of the needle holder is engaged within the nozzle by a taper 

lock. To switch from the normal mode to the retraction mode, the taper lock is 
disengaged by rotary movement of the plunger relative to the barrel. While 

preventing rotary movement of the needle holder relative to the barrel, continued 
rotary movement of the plunger causes a lateral arm of the needle holder to ascend 

through the helical slot so that the needle holder retracts into the coaxial cavity of the 
plunger and the needle is concealed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to hypodermic needles. In particular,
the present invention relates to various needle assemblies which conceal the sharp
point of the hypodermic needle following use and in accordance with the
preamble of claim 1.A hypodermic needle has many applications in modem medicine. One
application is to fit the hypodermic needle into a syringe and to then insert the needle
into a person's body for intra-muscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection of
medications. Another application of the hypodermic needle is to introduce a
guidewire into a central vein of a person. The hypodermic needle acts as a sharp
introducing instrument through which the guidewire is advanced into the vein of the
patient. Following insertion of the guidewire, the needle is removed and a catheter is
threaded over the guidewire and, when in place, used for diagnostic monitoring or
for therapeutic procedures such as hemodialysis. Yet another application is to collect
blood samples for tests using a hypodermic needle with two sharp puncturing beveled
ends mounted on the barrel of a syringe. The distal puncturing end of the needle is
inserted into a person's vein while an inverted rubber-capped vacuum tube is pushed
into the barrel so that the other end of the needle pierces the rubber cap of the
vacuum tube. Thus, a blood sample passes from the vein, through the needle, and
into the vacuum tube. A fourth application of the hypodermic needle is to coaxially
mount a catheter over a hypodermic needle and to puncture a vein of a person's body
with the needle. Following needle puncture, the over-the-needle ("OTN") catheter is
advanced into the vein, the needle is removed, and the catheter is connected to an
intravenous line for fluid infusions into the vein. The foregoing applications
constitute the most common applications of hypodermic needles.A hypodermic needle entering into a patient's body is invariably contaminated
by the patient's blood and body fluids. Following use of the needle, the needle
presents a risk to physicians, nurses, and other health care personnel because the
needle might transmit an infection or disease to such personnel if it were to
accidently puncture them. Thus, health care personnel are in constant danger of
contracting infections and diseases, some of which may be deadly. Other potential 
victims of accidental needle punctures include sanitation workers which later dispose
of garbage containing the hypodermic needle. The diseases which may be transmitted
by a contaminated

<CLAIMS>
A needle-syringe assembly operable in a normal mode and
convertible to a retraction mode, comprising:


an elongated, generally cylindrical barrel (100,200) forming a
single cylindrical interior cavity, a hollow nozzle (110,210) located

at the distal end (120) of said barrel (100,200) and opening into
the interior of said barrel (100, 200);
a plunger (102,202) slidably mounted in said single cylindrical
interior cavity of said barrel (100,200) and forming a longitudinal

cavity extending between the distal end (120) and the proximal
end of said plunger (102, 202);
a needle holder (108,208) carrying a hollow needle (106,206)
on the distal end thereof, said needle holder (108,208) being

slidably mounted in said longitudinal cavity of said plunger (102,
202), said needle holder (108,208) detachably engaging said

barrel (100,200) with the distal portion of said needle holder
(108,208) disposed within said nozzle (110,210) of said barrel

(100,200) during the normal mode;

characterized in that said assembly further comprises a coupling
mechanism which causes disengagement of said needle holder

(108, 208) from said barrel (100, 200) to switch the assembly from
the normal mode to the retraction mode and which in response to

the rotation of the plunger relative to the barrel causes retraction
of said needle holder (108, 208) into said longitudinal cavity of

said plunger (102, 202) such that said needle (106, 206) is
concealed within the assembly.
The needle-syringe assembly of claim 1, wherein said retraction
means includes retainer means for limiting rotation of said needle

holder relative to said barrel (100,200) in response to rotation of
said plunger (102,202) relative to said barrel.
The needle-syringe assembly of claim 1, wherein said plunger
(102,202) includes a longitudinal slot (138,238) exposing said

cavity (134,234) to the outer surface of said plunger (102,202),
and said needle holder (108,208) includes a leg portion (142,242)

and a lateral arm, (144,244), said leg portion (142,242) being
disposed within said cavity (134,234) and being longitudinally

moveable through said cavity (134,234) in response to longitudinal
movement of said plunger (102,202) during the normal mode, said

lateral arm (144,244) extending laterally through said longitudinal
slot (138,238) and being movable through said longitudinal slot

(138,238) in response to longitudinal movement of said plunger
(102,202) during the normal mode.
A guidewire insertion assembly including the needle-syringe
assembly of one of claims 1 to 3 comprising:


a one-way valve (256) disposed within said needle holder for
permitting a guidewire (250) to pass therethrough in one direction

and for preventing blood from passing therethrough in the opposite
direction.
