<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the present invention is a panel which absorbs acoustic energy in the low, medium and high frequencies, in particular in the frequencies lying between 400 Hz and 5000 Hz. Panel characterised in that it is essentially constructed from a plate (1) of semi-rigid foam with open, communicating cells and from a bed (2) of linked fibres or from a flexible cellular material, the whole operating according to a mass/spring principle.

Panel absorbing acoustic energy in the low, medium and
high frequencies, in particular in frequencies between 400 Hz

and 5000 Hz, essentially consisting of a sheet (1) of semi-rigid
foam with communicating open cells and of a layer (2) of

bound fibres or of a flexible cellular material, characterised
in that the assembly operates by a mass/spring principle, the

sheet (1) of semi-rigid foam which constitutes the mass of the
assembly operating by the mass/spring principle and

advantageously being a semi-rigid polyurethane foam having a
density between 20 kg/m
3
 and 50 kg/m
3
, a thickness between 5 mm
and 15 mm and permeability to air of between 5 litres per

minute and 45 litres per minute in the case of an 80 mm
diameter sample, while the layer (2) of fibres which are bound

or made of flexible cellular material constitutes the spring
of this assembly.
Panel according to claim 1, characterised in that the
layer (2) constituting the spring and formed by a sheet of

bound fibres or a flexible cellular material advantageously
has, on the one hand, a rigidity between 0.007 MPa and 0.05

MPa and, on the other hand, a thickness between 4 mm and 10
mm.
Panel according to any one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the layer (2) forming a spring consists

of a cellular material made of flexible polyurethane foam,
rubber latex foam or rubber foam.
Panel according to any one of claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the layer (2) forming a spring consists

of bound vegetable or animal or synthetic fibres. 
Panel according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the layer (2) preferably consists of 40%

to 80% of polyester type fibres having a yarn count or
diameter between 4 decitex and 20 decitex, these fibres being

combined with hot-melt fibres having a count between 4 decitex
and 20 decitex, the latter fibres being combined in a

proportion of between 20% and 60%.
Panel according to claim 5, characterised in that the
layer (2) is preferably composed of 70% of polyester fibres

having a count of 6.7 decitex and of 30% of hot-melt fibres
having a count of 4 decitex.
