<ABSTRACT>
When a key other than a regular key or the like is 
inserted to forcibly rotate a key rotor, a coupling member is 

moved in a direction indicated by an arrow by an uncoupling 
mechanism. This movement uncouples a rear rotor from the 

coupling member. As a result, the key rotor and a sleeve only 
rotate idly, and the rear rotor and a lock lever are not 

rotated. Hence, a cylinder lock is not unlocked, and no 
damaging force is never applied to components of the cylinder 

lock such as tumblers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cylinder locks designed to prohibit wrongful unlocking and in
particular to a cylinder lock according to the preamble of each of claims 1 to 4.A cylinder lock arranged on a door of an automobile is
designed as follows. A plurality of tumblers are arranged so
as to be movable in radial directions in a key rotor that is
rotatably arranged in a rotor case, and such plurality of
tumblers are urged by springs in a single direction. As the
rotation of the key rotor is blocked with end portions of the
tumblers engaged with tumbler engagement grooves arranged in
inner circumferential portions while inserted thereinto, the
cylinder lock can be locked.To unlock the cylinder lock, a regular key is inserted
into a keyhole of the key rotor. As a result, the respective
tumblers are moved so as to be released from the tumbler
engagement grooves by the key. As the key is rotated, the key
rotor is rotated, which causes the lock lever to rotate and
hence unlocks the cylinder lock.In the cylinder lock of this type
when a key other than the regular key,
a screwdriver, or the like is inserted into the keyhole of the
key rotor to forcibly rotate the key rotor, the end portions of 
the tumblers are forcibly biased onto the tumbler engagement
grooves of the rotor case, which in turn breaks either the
tumblers or the rotor case. As a result, the cylinder lock is
no longer used again.By the way it is conceivable to
improve the strength of the respective components of the
cylinder lock. However, this requires that the thicknesses of
the components be increased, which in turn imposes the problem
of increasing the size of the cylinder lock as a whole.Another way to prohibit wrongful unlocking is presented by the European Patent
Application 0571 249 A1.Said prior art document discloses a tumbler-lock with a rotor turnably arranged in an
intermediate sleeve, said sleeve being on its part rotatably provided in a fixedly
arranged housing. The rotor is provided with radially movable tumblers, such as
plates or pistons, said tumblers interlocking the rotor with said intermediate sleeve
when no key is inserted. An intermediate plate is slidably received in the sleeve and
is provided to rotate integrally with the sleeve. A retaining member is slidably received
in a cap member to rotate integrally with said cap member. The retaining member and
intermediate plate are spring biased and kept at their relative position to each other by
a protrusion groove combination. In the case where a wrong key is inserted, the
