<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and a device in 
the regulation of the headbox of a paper 

machine/board machine, in which method additional 
flows are introduced into the pulp suspension at 

different points across the width of the headbox, the 
concentration of said additional flow differing from 

the average concentration of the pulp suspension. 
The additional flows (Q
2.1
,Q
2.2
...Q
2.n
) are introduced 
through additional-flow pipes (26a₁,26a₂...26a
n
) 
to the vicinity of the inlet opening (C₁,C₂...) 

of the turbulence tube (29a₁,29a₂...) of the turbulence 
generator (20). In the method, the grammage 

profile of the web in the direction of width of the 
web is regulated by, in the headbox, adjusting the 

distance of the end of the additional-flow pipe/pipes 
(26a₁,26a₂...) from the turbulence generator (20), 

whereby the amount of the additional flow (Q
2.1
, 
Q
2.2
...) entering into the additional-flow pipe 
(26a₁,26a₂...) and, at the same time, the amount of 

the pulp suspension flow (Q
1.1
, Q
1.2
...) are 
affected, whereby the combined flow (Q
3.1
, Q
3.2
...), 
as a sum flow into the turbulence generator (20), is 

regulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and a device in the regulation of the headbox of a 
paper/board machine. As is known from the prior art, the discharge flow of the pulp suspension out of the 
headbox must be of uniform velocity in the transverse direction of the paper 
machine. A transverse flow, which produces distortion of the fibre orientation, 
affects the quality factors of the paper produced, such as anisotropy of strength and 
stretch. The level and variation of anisotropy in the transverse direction also affect 
the printing properties of the paper. In particular, it is an important requirement that 
the main axes of the directional distribution, i.e. orientation, of the fibre mesh in the 
paper coincide with the directions of the main axes of the paper and that the 
orientation is symmetric in relation to these axes. At the edges of the pulp-flow duct in the headbox, a smaller amount of pulp flows. 
This edge effect produces a very strong linear distortion in the fibre-orientation 
profile. Profile faults in the turbulence generator of the headbox usually produce a 
non-linear distortion in the fibre-orientation profile inside the lateral areas of the 
flow ducts. Attempts are made to compensate for an unevenness of the grammage profile arising 
from the drying-shrinkage of paper by means of a crown formation of the slice, so 
that the slice is thicker in the middle of the pulp jet. When the paper web is dried, 
it shrinks in the middle area of the web to a lower extent than in the lateral areas, 
the shrinkage being, as a rule, in the middle about 4 % and in the lateral areas about 
5...6 %. Said shrinkage profile produces a corresponding change in the transverse 
grammage profile of the web so that, owing to the shrinkage, the dry grammage 
profile of a web whose transverse grammage profile was uniform after the press is 
changed during the drying so that, in both of the lateral areas of the web, the  
 
grammage is slightly higher than in the middle area. As is known from the prior art, 
said grammage profile has been regulated by means of the profile bar so that the 
profile bar of the headbox is kept more open in the middle area than in the lateral 
areas. By means of said arrangement, the pulp suspension is forced to move towards 
the middle area of the web. Said circumstance further affects the alignment of the 
fibre orientation. The main axes of the directional distribution, i.e. orientation, of 
the fibre mesh should coincide with the directions of the main axes of the paper, and
