<ABSTRACT>
Pharmaceutical compositions which comprise short peptides which function as IGF-1 receptor antagonists are provided. The peptides used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention consist of less than 25 amino acids, comprise at least a portion of the C or D domain from IGF-1 and inhibit IGF-1 induced autophosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors. Methods of inhibiting cell proliferation and of treating individuals suspected of suffering from or susceptible to diseases associated with undesirable cell proliferation such as cancer, restenosis and asthma are disclosed.

 I6F-1 ANALOGSCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application Serial Number 07/881,524 filed May -8, 1993, pending, which is incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONEvidence indicates that the interaction of Insulin- like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) with its own receptor (IGF-1R or, alternatively referred to as type 1 receptor) plays a major role in normal development and in the control of both normal and abnormal cell growth. In growth hormone disturbances of growth as, for instance, in acromegalics and in patients with growth hormone deficiency, clinical assessments of disease activity correlate far better with blood levels of IGF-1 than they do with growth hormone concentrations (Van Wyk et al. , The Biology of Normal Human Growth, pp. 223-239, Raven Press, NY (1981)). Werner et al., Proc . Nat . Acad. Sci . USA, 86:7451-5 (1989) have shown that the mRNA levels for the IGF-1R decrease steadily in all tissues during post-natal development, reaching a maximum during the perinatal stages. IGF-1 mRNA, instead, is not so tightly regulated during development as the mRNA for the IGF-1 R, and actually reaches maximum expression in the adult liver, which is the main site of production of IGF-1.Apart from these general considerations, a number of reports have appeared indicating that the interaction of IGF-1 with its own receptor play a major role in cell growth. For instance, IGF-IRs are present in phytohemagglutinin activated T lymphocytes, Kozak et al., Cell Immunol . , 1009:318-331 (1987) 

and in K562 cells that are a human erythroleukemia cell line, Hizuka et al., Endocrinol . Japon, 34:81-88 (1987). In fact, K562 cells grow vigorously in serum free media (SFM) containing only IGF-1 or supraphysiological concentrations of insulin. An abundance of IGF-lRs has also been reported in lymphoblasts of human T cell leukemias, Lee et al. , J. Clin . Endocrinol . & Metabol . , 62:28-35 (1986), and in HL60 cells, Pepe et al. , J. Cell Physiol . , 133:219-227 (1987). In our own laboratory, we have been able to show that the mRNA for the IGF-1R is over- expressed in HL60 cells. HL60 cells, as well as other cell lines, grow well in serum-free medium containing only insulin in supraphysiological concentrations. In Burkitt cells, the number of IGF-lRs increase between G1 and S-3 phase, Hartman et al., Leukemia, 2:241-4 (1988). Stem cells and progenitor cells also seem to require IGF-1 for growth.
