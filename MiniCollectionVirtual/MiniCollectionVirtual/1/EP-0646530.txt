<ABSTRACT>
A variable capacity packaging container for stacks of 
paper (20) of different heights comprising a rectangular tray 

portion (21) having first and second pairs of upstanding side 
walls (22), and a top cover having two or more downwardly 

dependent sides characterised in that, the dimensions of the 
first pair of upstanding side walls (23) are sufficient to 

accommodate and cover first opposed sides of the maximum 
height of stack with a portion which can be bent over the 

top of the stack (20), and the downwardly dependent sides (24,25) being 
of sufficient depth to engage the second pair of upstanding 

side walls (23) with the same maximum height of stack (20) when said 
cover is located on said tray portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a variable capacity 
packaging container for stacks of paper of different 
heights. Paper sheets are generally supplied by the 
manufacturers in stacks consisting of a standard number of 
sheets, for example a ream of 500 sheets. However, 
different grades of paper have different weights or 
substances, typically measured in grammes per square metre. 
As a result, a sheet of one grade will have a different 
thickness (or caliper) to a sheet of another grade. A stack 
of a standard number of sheets for a range of paper grades 
will therefore vary in height in dependence on the 
thicknesses of the individual sheets in each stack. It is known to package such stacks in containers 
comprising a base with upstanding side walls and a lid with 
downwardly projecting walls. However, if a stack of a given 
height is placed in a box intended for a stack of smaller 
height, the box lid may not adequately enclose and afford 
sufficient protection to the stack. It is therefore 
necessary to provide containers of different sizes in order 
to accommodate stacks of different grades of paper. It is also known to provide boxes in which a lid is 
provided which can be opened upwardly by being hinged along 
one side. The disadvantage with such constructions is that 
if the boxes are made from a single blank it is expensive or 
impractical to print one form of decoration on the lid, 
which could carry advertising material, and a different less 
expensive pattern on the remainder or to use a different 
material for the lid to the remainder of the box.  The present invention is intended to overcome some of 
the difficulties referred to above and to provide a 
container which has a variable capacity and can thus 
accommodate sheets of different heights. Moreover, a top 
cover can be provided which, if desired, can be separate 
from the lower portion and can thus be printed separately. According to the present invention a variable 
capacity packaging container for stacks of paper of 
different heights comprises a rectangular tray portion 
having first and second pairs of upstanding side walls, and 
a top cover having two or more downwardly dependent sides, 
the dimensions of the first pair of upstanding side walls 
being sufficient to accommodate and cover first opposed 
sides of the maximum height of stack with a portion which 
can be bent over the top of the stack, and the downwardly 
dependent sides being of sufficient depth to engage the 
second pair of upstanding side walls with the same maximum 
he

A container as claimed in claim 1 characterised in 
that said top cover is separate from said tray portion prior 

to loading the container. 
A container as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that two or more bend lines are provided on 

each of the first pair of upstanding side walls to 
accommodate stacks of paper of different heights. 
A container as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the top cover is scored with a bend 

line to enable only part of the cover to be opened when the 
package has been assembled.

that said bend line is arranged in relation to opposed side 

edges thereof. 
A container as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims 2 to 5 characterised in that the top cover and tray 

portion are provided as a pair of blanks which have been 
pre-shaped and scored to provide bend lines.

2 to 6 characterised in that the top cover is printed with a 

different form of printing to the tray portion. 
A container as claimed in any one of preceding claims 
2 to 7 characterised in that the top cover is made from a 

different material to the tray portion. 
A pair of blanks for constructing the container set 
forth in any one of preceding claims 2 to 8 characterised in 

that said blanks are suitably cut to shape and scored to 
provide bend lines. 
A container as set forth in any one of claims 2 to 8 
characterised by being made from the blanks set forth in 

claim 9 and containing a stack of paper. 
A method of assembling a package containing a stack 
of paper characterised by including bending the blanks as 

set forth in claim 9 about the stack of paper to form the 
container set forth in any one of claims 1 to 8.
