<ABSTRACT>
A method is described which makes it possible to use VLSI-quality crystalline semiconductor substrates for the fabrication of the active devices of Active Matrix Flat Panels (AMFPD). The VLSI substrates are provided by arranging a layer of light transparent material in those areas of a semiconductor wafer in which no active device has to be provided, eliminating the semiconductor wafer whereby a transparent wafer is obtained with crystalline semiconductor regions therein and then shaping the transparent wafer into a sized module unit. Several module units can be bonded to a glass substrate and a conductive material is then deposited to make electrical interconnections between the module units. The bonding operation can be performed either at room temperature using a light-transparent glue or at higher temperature using a wafer bonding technique known in the art of Silicon-On-Insulator technology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the fabrication
of Active Matrix Flat Panel Display (AMFPD)
devices, and more particularly, to a method of providing
VLSI-quality crystalline semiconductor substrates
for use in the production of AMFPDs, of which Active
Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCDs) are given as an
example of application.It is widely acknowledged that the most important cause
of reduction in yield in high volume production of
large area AMFPDs is the high number of damaged active
devices. The main causes for having damaged devices are
the high defect density and also the grain boundaries
that exist in the material which the substrates are
made of. These causes place unavoidable limits on
device dimension down-scaling, and therefore on circuit
redundancy, as well as pixel size and density.AMFPD devices are currently fabricated on amorphous
silicon substrates. The use of amorphous silicon
results from the fact that it is not possible to
produce crystalline substrates by simply depositing
silicon on an amorphous starting material such as
glass. Although it is possible to obtain polycrystalline
substrates, their fabrication requires more expensive 
starting materials to be used and/or more
processing steps to be applied.The standard LCD fabrication has been disclosed by W.
C. O'Mara in "Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays
Part I: Manufacturing Process", Solid State Technology
December 1991, pp. 64-69, and statistics for the causes
of failure of assembled panels are reported therein.In the article "Present and Future Trend of Electron
Device Technology in Flat Panel Display" by T. Uchida,
IEEE IEDM Technical Digest 1991, pp. 1.2.1-1.2.6, there
is disclosed a formula for the yield of LCD panels as
a function of the defect density, circuit redundancy,
pixel density, and total area of the panel.The possibility of having a high quality crystalline
semiconductor substrate, like the silicon wafers employed
in VLSI technology, would drastically reduce the
surface defect density, with a consequent reduction in
the number of damaged devices and thereby a major improvement
in the manufacturing yield.A method of providing
an active matrix flat panel display device according to the present invention is defined in claim 1.Further features of the invention are defined in dependent claims 2-4. This invention makes it possible to provide AMFPDs
using VLSI-quality crystalline substrates instead of
amorphous or polycrystalline substrates, thus resulting
in higher fabrication yields and devices having
