<ABSTRACT>
A microbiocide-containing concentrate for use in thermoplastic polymers as well as in plastisols, is disclosed. The concentrate is primarily solid at ambient conditions and comprises from 1-30 wt% of a microbiocide, a polymer plasticizer and up to 20 wt% of a thermoplastic resin. These concentrates are primarily useful as masterbatch compositions used for incorporation into polymers in order to protect said polymers from fungal or bacterial attack. Along these lines, the present document also discloses processes for incorporating these materials into a polymer or plastisol and polymers or plastisols made by these processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a concentrate which contains a 
biocide and is primarily solid under ambient conditions. By primarily 
solid is meant solid, wax-like or having another non-gas and non-liquid 
appearance, such as a gel or paste composition. Polymer compositions are protected against fungal or bacterial attack 
by the incorporation therein of a microbiocide to prevent 
deterioration of the polymer composition due to microbiological attack 
on the susceptible portion of its components. For example, German 
Patent DE 1,288,790 discloses the incorporation of urea or thiourea 
compounds, optionally together with a plasticizer, into polymers to 
impart antimicrobiocidal properties to the polymers. Furthermore, 
US 3,864,468 discloses the incorporation of microbiocides, such as 
10,10'-oxybisphenoxyarsine (OBPA), into plastisols which may comprise 
liquid plasticizers, such as dioctylphthalate. In order for the microbiocide to be effective in the polymer 
composition, it is necessary that it be compatible therewith and 
uniformly dispersable therein to avoid the formation of areas within 
the polymer which contain insufficient biocide to prevent polymer 
deterioration. To avoid toxicological problems related to the handling of the pure 
microbiocide, microbiocides are presently added to polymer 
compositions as a microbiocide-containing concentrate. Said 
concentrate can take different forms, such as: a liquid, a powder, or 
a non-powdery solid.  
 Liquid concentrates are usually based on a plasticizer which is liquid 
at ambient conditions in combination with a cosolvent. By ambient 
conditions is meant: standard pressure and room temperature (about 20° 
-30°C). Without a cosolvent only low concentrations of the 
microbiocide can be obtained due to the low solubility of commonly 
used microbiocides in liquid plasticizers. Said cosolvent, however, 
may destabilize the concentrate or adversely effect the polymer 
composition with which it is to be mixed. A further problem arises 
from the fact that it is difficult to completly remove a liquid  
 
concentrate from packaging used for transport or storage, so that 
unless it can be reused or cleaned, this packaging becomes toxic 
waste. Problems related to the toxicity of such compositions can be overcome 
by incorporating the microbiocide in a solid compostion in such a way 
that it is immobilised under conditions that allow transport, storage, 
and the like. The following two ways of doing this were developed in 
the past. United States patent
