<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing a
photohardenable elastomeric element which can be used to
make a flexographic printing plate. More particularly,
this invention relates to an improved process for
preparing a photohardenable elastomeric element having
an increased exposure latitude.Photohardenable elements have a support and a layer
of photosensitive material, which is photopolymerizable
or photocrosslinkable, applied thereon. Photohardenable
elements can be used to prepare flexographic printing
plates. Such elements generally comprise (1) an
addition polymerizable nongaseous ethylenically
unsaturated monomer, (2) a photoinitiating system
activated by actinic radiation, and (3) an elastomeric
or thermoplastic-elastomeric polymeric binder comprising
polymerized conjugated diene monomers. Photohardenable
compositions such as these frequently contain
plasticizers to increase the softness and flexibility of
the developed flexographic plates.Processes for making photohardenable elements and
producing flexographic printing plates therefrom are
well known in the art. Photohardenable elements are
typically prepared by mixing the monomer, the 
photoinitiator, and the binder, usually at an elevated
temperature. A plasticizer is then added to the mixture
and the resulting mixture is then formed into a sheet
structure by several known methods such as solvent
casting, hot pressing, calendering and extrusion.
Generally, the mixture is formed into a sheet structure
by using an extrusion and calendering process. Once the
photopolymer composition is in the form of a sheet, the
element can then be used to make a printing plate by
first exposing the element imagewise to actinic
radiation. The areas of the photohardenable layer which
are exposed to the radiation are photopolymerized or
photocrosslinked and thereby become less soluble in
developer solvents. The unexposed or unpolymerized
areas of the element are subsequently washed off using a
suitable developer solvent. There can be additional
post-development treatments such as detackification and
post-exposure.There are problems associated with making a
photohardenable element using the above-described
process. For example, it is often difficult to add
plasticizer materials to the other components of the
photopolymerizable composition if the plasticizer used
is a highly viscous material. The plasticizer cannot be
added directly to the other components prior to mixing
because it causes agglomeration of the solid materials.
Similarly, when the plasticizer
