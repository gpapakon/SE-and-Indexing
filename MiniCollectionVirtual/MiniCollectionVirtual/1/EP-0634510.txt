<ABSTRACT>
A method of knitting single knit fabrics on a 
circular knitting machine such that the fabric has 

improved elasticity, soft hand and drapeability and 
including controlling two types of needles arranged 

alternately in the cylinder and sinkers arranged in the 
sinker dial through four processes in which alternate 

needles are raised to the knitting level in the first 
process and intervening needles are raised to the 

tucking level and an old loop has cleared the latch on 
each needle and a previously fed yarn is held in the 

hook of each intervening needle, a first ground yarn (G1) is 
fed to the alternate and intervening needles and the 

needles are lowered to a high welt level for the 
alternate needles so that the old loop is not knocked 

over and a low welt level for the intervening needles 
so that the old loop is knocked over and a new double 

yarn stitch loop is formed. The levels to which the 
alternate and intervening needles are raised are 

reversed in the third process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the
formation of single-knit fabrics having improved non-run,
elasticity, soft hand and drapeability
characteristics and more particularly to an improved
method of producing such fabrics.It is well known to produce a knit fabric
having elasticity of double plain jersey loops of a
ground yarn and an elastic yarn. One example of such a
knitting method includes raising all needles to the
knitting level where the old loops clear the latches on
the needles and feeding both the ground yarn and the
elastic yarn to the needles. As the needles descend,
the sinkers withdraw so that the old loops knock over
at the sinker tops and double loops are formed by the
needles and sinkers of the ground yarn and the elastic
yarn in each loop.While producing knit fabrics of excellent
elasticity, this prior method has difficulties and
deficiencies. For example, the elastic yarn causes the
fabric to contract in both the course and wale
directions which results in deformed loops. The
resulting fabric has a hard hand and poor drapeability. 
Also, elastic yarn breakage is difficult to correct
during knitting of such fabric.Another example of a prior method of
producing knit fabric having double jersey loops is
disclosed in United States Patent No. 2,379,649. While
producing a single-knit fabric of double jersey loops
which overcomes the difficulties and deficiencies of
the aforementioned method, the method of this prior
patent has other difficulties and deficiencies. For
example, the needles of the knitting machine are
arranged in two groups and the two yarns are
alternately fed to the front and the back of the hooks
of the knitting needles in the two groups. To
accomplish this, the group of needles to the back of
which a yarn is being fed must rise sharply at the back
of the first yarn guide. This type of yarn feeding is
difficult and inaccurate and frequently results in less
than desirable quality.The Great Britain Patent No. 366 180 discloses a knitted
fabric composed of twin thread loops throughout in which one
thread is embodied in every needle wale in every course and
the other thread is embodied in alternated needle wales in
one course and in the remaining needle wales of the next
following course and the loops in alternate needle wales are
as a result staggered relatively to those in the remainder
and the two threads comprising the sinker wales in each
course are disposed at an angle to each other. With the foregoing in mind, it is an object
of the present invention to provide a method of

A method of knitting single knit fabric having improved elasticity,
soft hand and drapeability on a circular knitting machine having two types

of cylinder needles arranged alternately on a cylinder of the circular
knitting machine, sinkers arranged in a sinker dial, and at least two yarn

carriers for feeding two yarns to the needles, the method

   
being characterized in
 that the cylinder needles are
controlled in a first process in which alternate needles are raised to a

knitting level and intervening needles are raised to a tucking level and in
which an old loop is held in the sinker throat of the sinkers and clears the

latch of the needle raised to the knitting level and a ground yarn previously
fed to the intervening needles does not clear the latch when those needles

are raised to the tucking level but the old loop which has previously
cleared the latch is held by the sinker throat on the shank of the intervening

needle,

a first ground yarn is fed to the alternate and intervening needles,
the first ground yarn joining the previously fed ground yarn in the hook of

the intervening needle while the first ground yarn is held in the hook of the
alternated needle,
the alternate needles are lowered to a high welt level such that the
first ground yarn is drawn over the sinker nose but the old loop does not

clear the hook of the needles as the alternate needles are moved to a
second process while lowering the intervening needles to a low welt level

to draw the first ground yarn over the sinker nose and the previously fed
ground yarn over the sinker top and to knock over the old loop from the

intervening needles to form a new loop of two ground yarns as the needles
are moved to the second process, 
the alternate and intervening needles and the sinkers are controlled
in the second process by holding the alternate and intervening needles in

their respective welt levels while withdrawing the sinkers so that the first
ground yarn slips off the sinker nose and onto the sinker top and then

advancing the sinkers to capture the old loop and the first ground yarn in
the sinker throat with respect to alternate needles and to capture the old

loop and the new loop with respect to the intervening needles,
the needles and sinkers are moved to a third process and the
needles and sinkers are controlled in the third process to raise the intervening

needles to the knitting position while maintaining the sinkers in the
advanced position so that the new loop formed in the first process is now

an old loop and clears the latch on the intervening needles and to raise the
alternate needles to the tucking level so that the first ground yarn does not

clear the latch of the alternate needle,
a second ground yarn is fed to the alternate and intervening needles;
the alternate and intervening needles are lowered to the low and
high welt levels in the same manner as the intervening and alternate

needles were lowered in the first process, and
the needles and sinkers are moved to a fourth process in which the
alternate and intervening needles and the sinkers are controlled in the

same manner as the intervening and alternate needles and the sinkers
were controlled in the second process.
The method according to claim 1 in which the alternate and intervening
needles are controlled and operated by cams having closed tracks

therein.
The method according to claim 1 wherein the stitch loops are drawn
over the top of the sinker nose and the sinker top of the sinkers having a

difference in height of between 1.5 mm and 2.2 mm. 
A method of knitting single knit fabric having improved elasticity,
soft hand and drapeability on a circular knitting machine having two types

of needles arranged alternately on a cylinder, sinkers arranged in a sinker
dial, and at least two yarn carriers for feeding two yarns to the needles, the

method

   
being characterized in
 that the needles, sinkers
and yarn carriers are controlled and operated through first through fourth

processes in which alternate needles are raised to the knitting level and
intervening needles are raised to the tucking level in the first process, an

old loop has cleared the latch on each needle and is held on the shank of
the needle by the sinkers and a previously fed yarn is held in the hooks of

intervening needles, a ground yarn is fed to both alternate and intervening
needles, the alternate needles are lowered to a high welt level so that the

old loop is not knocked over, but remains on the alternate needle while the
intervening needles are lowered to a low welt level so that the old loop is

knocked over and a new loop of the previously fed yarn and the first
ground yarn is formed, and in which intervening needles are raised to the

knitting level and alternate needles are raised to the tucking level in the
third process, a second ground yarn is fed to both alternate and intervening

needles, and the intervening needles are lowered to the high welt
level and the alternate needles are lowered to the low welt level to form a

new loop of the first and second ground yarns.
