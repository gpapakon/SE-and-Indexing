<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the manufacture of uncoated technical fabrics consisting of synthetic fibres with an air permeability set in a controlled manner, shrinkage activation for fabric compacting takes place continuously, directly after the weaving operation, in an aqueous bath (6) at a temperature of 20 - 100 DEG C in a treatment tank installed downstream of the loom and having a subsequent drying zone (13). The method is particularly suitable for the manufacture of airbag fabrics.

Method of manufacturing uncoated technical fabrics
from synthetic spun yarns having a purposefully

adjusted air permeability, characterized in that at
the loom a shrinkage of the fabric is initiated

continuously immediately after the weaving process in
a treatment trough (6) containing an aqueous bath at a

temperature of 20 - 100 °C and then a drying zone (13)
is travelled through, units upstream (5) and

downstream (12, 14) of the treatment trough (6)
regulating the speed of the fabric and at least one of

the units (12, 14) downstream of the treatment trough
(6) being operated 2-12 % more slowly than the unit

(5) upstream of the treatment trough (6).
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
bath has a temperature of 60 - 100 °C.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
bath has a temperature of 90 - 95 °C.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the
bath has a temperature of 20 - 60 °C.
Method according to at least one of claims 1 - 4,
characterized in that the units are duos and at least

one of the duos (12, 14) downstream of the treatment
trough (6) containing the aqueous bath is operated

2-12 % more slowly than the duo (5) upstream of the
treatment trough (6).
Method according to at least one of claims 1 - 5,
characterized in that a drying zone (13) continuously

adjoins the passage through the treatment trough (6)
containing the bath. 
Method according to at least one of claims 1 - 6,
characterized in that, for weaving, a water jet loom

is used, at which a shrinkage is initiated, and the
residual initiation of shrinkage of the manufactured

fabric is effected in an aqueous bath continuously
immediately after the weaving process.
Use of the method according to at least one of claims
1 - 7 for manufacturing uncoated technical fabrics

having low air permeabilities below 20 l/dm
2

1 - 7 for manufacturing uncoated technical fabrics

having purposefully adjusted air permeabilities
between 20 and 120 l/dm
2
·min, measured at 500 Pa test
differential pressure.
Use of the method according to at least one of claims

1 - 7 for manufacturing contact fabrics for airbags.
Use of the method according to at least one of claims
