<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, each elementary cell comprises two resonators (R1, R2). Each resonator (R1, R2) comprises a microband (MR1, MR2) of which one branch (L1, L2) is used for coupling and has one end (e1, e2) connected to frame (22) and a capacitor (C1, C2) which is also connected to frame (22). The cells are connected directly to each other. Application to the fabrication of pass-band filters, particularly in the FM band.

<CLAIMS>
Band-pass filter with coupled resonators,
characterized in that it comprises at least one

elementary filtering cell, each elementary cell being
formed by a number of resonators exclusively equal to

two, hereafter referred to as the first and second
resonator, each resonator of a cell comprising:

microstrip, this first part (L1, L2) having an end
(e1, e2) connected to an electrical reference

earth (22), the two first parts (L1, L2) belonging
to the first and second resonators (R1, R2) in the

same cell (C) being juxtaposed and providing
coupling between the first and second resonators
