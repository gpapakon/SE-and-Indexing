<ABSTRACT>
Anti-vibration mount (support) with a device for limiting its excursion in extension, this mount including a rigid part 1 designed to be fixed to a first structural element, and a deformable or movable part 3 designed to be fixed to a second structural element, the relative displacements between these two parts optionally being braked by internal damping means. This mount is characterised in that the said limiting device is made up of a cable 7 of practically inextensible substance running over the said deformable or movable part 3 and the ends of which are fastened into notches 6 formed in lugs 5 integral with the said rigid part 1. Application to engine mounts.

<CLAIMS>
Anti-vibration support with a device for limiting its 
extension movements, this support having a rigid part (1) 

suitable for being fixed to a first structural member, and a 
deformable or movable part (3) suitable for being fixed to a 

second structural member, this device consisting of a cable 
(7) made of practically inextensible material, fitting over 

the said deformable or movable part (3), characterised in that 
the ends of the said cable are attached in recesses (6) formed 

in lugs (5) integral with the said rigid part (1). 
Support according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
said lugs (5) extend substantially perpendicularly to the 

principal direction of the said relative movements, the said 
cable (7) having the general shape of an arch. 
Support according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the said recesses (6) consist of a space formed between two 

fingers on the said lugs, the ends of the said cable (7) 
passing between these fingers and being retained by a ferrule 

(8) which is appreciably thicker than the cable (7) and bears 
underneath the corresponding lug (5). 
Support according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
said ferrule (8) is housed in an alveolus (10) moulded in one 

piece with the said deformable part (3), which consists of a 
moulded elastic mass. 
Support according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
said alveolus (10) is closed laterally by means of lips (8) 

for the snapping-in of the said ferrule. 
Support according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the said ferrules (8) are crimped at the 

ends of the said cable (7), which consists of a braid of steel  
 

or Kevlar wires, carbon or glass fibres, etc, this cable (7) 
being optionally surrounded by a plastic sheath. 
Support according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the said rigid part (1) has a base (2) for fixing to the said 

first structural member, and an arched plate (12) suitable for 
being fixed to the said base, in that the said lugs (5) are 

formed at the ends of the said plate (12), and in that the 
said base (2) has housings (13) for receiving the said 

ferrules (8). 
Support according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the said deformable or movable part (3) 

bears a covering of elastic material, at least in the areas on 
which the cable (7) and its ferrules (8) bear.
