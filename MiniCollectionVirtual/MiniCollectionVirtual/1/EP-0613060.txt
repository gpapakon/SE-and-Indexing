<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a developing 
cartridge (D) comprising a developing device having a 

containing portion containing developer and a bearing 
member for bearing the developer, a support member 

adapted to rotatably support the developing device (D) and 
having an opening portion, and lock means for locking 

a rotation of the developing device (D) with respect to 
the support member so that the angular position of 

the developing device is maintained irrespective of 
the angular position of the support member. 
A developing apparatus comprising a rotatable developing unit and at 
least a developing cartridge (Dc,Dm,Dy,Db) is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
a developing cartridge used with an
image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a
printer and the like and particularly used with a color
image forming apparatus.In full-color image forming apparatuses, a
developing unit including a yellow developing device,
a magenta developing device, a cyan developing device
and a black developing device is rotated to face a
selected developing device to an image bearing member.When such a developing unit is rotated, since
it is feared that developer leaks from the unit or the
developer is scattered, it is desirable to prevent
the orientation of the developing devices from
changing.Further, at the connection portion between each
developing device and its developer replenishing
portion, since the separation and connection are
effected in order to switch the developing devices for
developing a latent image formed on the image bearing 
member, the developer was particularly apt to
leak. Further, in order to exchange a developing
device the service life of which had expired, such a
developing device must be exchanged by a new one by
an expert and the maintenance must also be performed
by the expert. To avoid this, it is considered that
each of the developing devices is made as a cartridge.However, when the orientation of the developing
devices are maintained in a steady condition, since
the developing devices are rotated with respect to the
developing unit, it is necessary to provide peripheral
gaps between the developing devices and the developing
unit. In this case, it is difficult to mount the
developing cartridges on the developing unit with the
peripheral gaps.A concern of the present invention is to provide
a developing apparatus in which a plurality of developing
devices are made as respective cartridges.Another concern of the present invention is to
provide a developing apparatus in which developing
devices can be shifted while maintaining postures thereof
in a steady condition.A further concern of the present invention is
to provide a developing cartridge which can be easily
mounted. French Patent Specification No FR-A-2597 993
discloses a rotary multi-colour developing apparatus
having a rotatable developing drum which faces a
photoconductive drum. Rotation of the developing drum
enables different coloured toners to be sequentially
applied to the photo conductive drum to develop latent
images.US Patent Specification No US-A-3987756 discloses
a rotatable developing device which has a plurality of
developing units each of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A developing cartridge (D) which is provided with
a single developing device (12) which includes a

container (19) for containing a developer and a bearing
member (15) for bearing the developer to develop a latent

image on the image bearing member (1) of an image forming
apparatus, the developing cartridge being removably

mountable in the image forming apparatus, and
characterised in that
 the developing cartridge
comprises:


a support member (13) adapted to rotatably support
the single developing device, said support member having

an opening (13b) which enables said bearing member to be
opposed to said image bearing member when the developing

cartridge is mounted in the image forming apparatus; and
lock means (62, 63) for locking rotation of said
single developing device with respect to said support

member at a position where said bearing member is not
aligned with said opening and said container is aligned

with said opening.
A cartridge according to claim 1, wherein said

support member is substantially cylindrical.
A cartridge according to claim 1 or claim 2 and
further comprising a shaft portion (14) provided on said 

developing device for enabling the developing device to
rotate relative to said support member.
A cartridge according to any preceding claim and
further comprising a release mechanism (64) for releasing the

locking condition of said lock means to allow the bearing
member to move into register with the opening (13b).
A cartridge as claimed in any preceding claim in
combination with image forming apparatus having an image

bearing member (1), a rotatable developing unit (108) for
mounting a plurality of developing cartridges (D) so as to

bring a selected mounted developing cartridge into an
operative position with regard to said image bearing

member, and means (110, 9, 10) for rotating said
developing device relative to said support member during

rotation of said rotatable developing unit.
A combination as claimed in claim 5, wherein said
rotation means (110, 9, 10) rotates said developing

device relative to said support member in such a manner that the
orientation of said container remains unchanged.
