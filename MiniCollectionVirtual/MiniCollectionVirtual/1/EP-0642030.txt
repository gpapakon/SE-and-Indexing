<ABSTRACT>
The sensor comprises a magnetic flux guide including a first and a second parts (2, 3) separated longitudinally by a gap (4), and a magneto resistive bar arranged opposite and along this gap. According to the invention, the first and second parts (2, 3) of the guide are provided at their edges (7, 8) juxtaposed with the gap (4) respectively with a first and a second series of tongues (9, 10) separated by spacings, the tongues (9) of the first part (2) extending into the spacings of the second part (3) and conversely. The sensor according to the invention applies particularly to magnetic read heads.
