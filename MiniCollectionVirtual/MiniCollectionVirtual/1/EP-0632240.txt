<ABSTRACT>
A cooling and humidification device for cold rooms is proposed which is provided with evaporator elements (12) arranged in a fan air flow, a water-collecting trough arranged below the evaporator elements (12), a pump (16) pumping water from a water tank (15) provided with a heat exchanger (11) to a spray device spraying the evaporator elements (12) with water, and a compressor refrigerator connected to the evaporator elements (12) and the heat exchanger (11). In a single housing (10), the heat exchanger (11) is arranged below the evaporator elements (12) in the water-collecting trough designed as water tank (15). A compact cooling and humidification device of small volume can thereby be realised which only needs a small number of lines.

Refrigeration and humidifier unit for refrigerated chambers,
with evaporator elements (12) in the form of vertical panels

aligned parallel to one another, with a water collection tank
(15) arranged below the evaporator elements, with a pump (16) for

pumping water from a water reservoir provided with a heat
exchanger (11) and intended for ice-making, to a spraying device

(18) which sprays the evaporator elements with water, and with
a refrigerating machine compressor connected to the evaporator

elements and the heat exchanger, through which the evaporator
elements and the heat exchanger may be supplied with a coolant

independently of one another, characterized in that in a single
housing (10) the heat exchanger (11) is mounted beneath the

evaporator elements (12) in the water collection tank in the form
of a water reservoir (15), wherein the heat exchanger (11) is

also formed of panels through which coolant flows and which are
aligned vertically and parallel to one another, and wherein the

refrigerating machine compressor is integrated in the housing
(10) or is mounted directly adjacent to it.
Unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the housing
(10) has a central zone (19) allowing spray water to trickle down

from above, between the upper zone containing the evaporator
elements (12) and the lower zone containing the heat exchanger

(11).
Unit according to claim 2, characterized in that the central
zone (19) of the housing (10) is designed as the air-intake zone. 
Unit according to claim 3, characterized in that the zone
(19) designed as the air-intake zone is provided with one or more

intake fans (22, 23) on one or more sides.
Unit according to claim 4, characterized in that the fan or
fans (22, 23) are at an angle which directs the airflow upwards.
Unit according to any of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the housing (10) has air outlet vents (28) above the

evaporator elements (12), for the fan airflow .
Unit according to any of the preceding claims, characterized
in that a single pump (16) is provided to pump the water from the

water reservoir (15) to the spraying device (18).
Unit according to any of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the water reservoir (15) is provided with a level control

device (32) for the water.
Unit according to any of the preceding claims, characterized
in that a night current control unit, which operates the heat

exchanger during the night until ice is formed, is provided.
