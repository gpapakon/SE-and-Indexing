<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to an asymmetric reduction process.
The compound

is a topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which is proposed for treatment of glaucoma. The compound with a
methyl substituent in the 6 position in which the orientation is trans with regard to the 4-substituent (the 4S,6S diastereoisomer)
is of therapeutic interest, but it is difficult to produce in the absence of a preponderant amount of the cis
isomer (the 4R,6S diastereoisomer).We have devised a process for producing a compound of formula

in which X is hydrogen or a group of formula -SONH2 which is a useful intermediate in the production of the desired
trans (4S,6S) isomer III described above and derivatives thereof in an amount greater that that of the corresponding
cis isomer from a compound of formula I

   X = -H or -SO2 NH2Background chemistry related to the synthesis of these materials is disclosed in Jones, et al, J.Org.Chem 1991
56 763-769, Shinkai, J. Heterocyclic Chem. (1992) 29 627-639 and US Patents 4,968,814 and 4,968,815, and, in a
publication made subsequently to the priority of this patent application, by Blacklock et al J. Org Chem. 1993 58
1672-1679.The reduction of compound (I) using reducing agents such as boranetetrahydrofuran complex results in the formation
of the (4R,6S) diastereoisomer (IV) as the major product (>90%) with the desired (4S,6S) trans diastereoisomer
(II) accounting for a minor proportion of the product. 
Jones et al, J Org. Chem. (1991), 56, 763-769 have disclosed a method for the enantioselective reduction of a
close analogue, compound (V), using bakers yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). This reaction yields the (R)- and (S)-alcohols
in the ratio 11:89.
However, when a range of bakers' and brewers' yeasts were tested in the reduction of compound (I) the undesired
cis diastereoisomer was the major product (60 to 85%). Examination of a wider range of microorganisms (bacteria,
yeasts and fungi) demonstrated that most produced predominantly the undesired cis diastereoisomer. Surprisingly,
however, we have found that it is in fact possible to produce the trans isomer in preponderant yield by enzyme reduction
and have identified a range of microorganisms including bacteria, fungi and yeasts which are able to reduce compound
(I) to the desired trans alcohol (II).This invention comprises a process in which a compound of formula

in which X is hydrogen or a group of formula - SO2 NH2 is converted into a compound of formula

by contacting it with an enzyme reduction system at a pH 2 to 5
