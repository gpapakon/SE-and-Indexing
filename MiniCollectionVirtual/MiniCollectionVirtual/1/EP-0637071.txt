<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method of planarizing the surface of a 
silicon wafer in integrated circuit manufacture where 

trench isolation techniques are employed. The trenches 
(20-23) and active areas (31-34) on a semiconductor 

substrate (10) are conformally coated with a layer (15) 
of silicon oxide. A layer of patterned polysilicon then 

is deposited on top of the oxide and etched to create 
filler blocks (30) in depressions above the trenches. 

Next, the polysilicon is annealed to thereby fill the 
trenches with an expanded oxide block. The resulting 

relatively planar surface then is polished back to the 
nitride cap, to thereby produce a high degree of 

planarity across all trench and active area dimensions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor 
devices, and, in particular, is directed to a method of 
planarization in integrated circuit (IC) manufacture 
where trench isolation is employed. Device isolation typically is achieved by utilizing 
local oxidation of silicon ("LOCOS") or shallow trench 
isolation ("STI") techniques. In these device isolation 
techniques, isolation commonly is provided by forming a 
recess or trench between two active areas, upon which 
the electronic devices are located, and filling the 
trench with an isolation material. Shallow trench 
isolation serves to provide higher packing density, 
improved isolation, and greater planarity, by avoiding 
the topographical irregularities encountered when using 
conventional thick film oxide isolation. In particular, 
the growth of thermal field oxide using a mask, such as 
nitride, creates an encroachment of the oxide into the 
active areas; this encroachment is referred to as the  
 
"bird's beak effect." Trench isolation technology 
includes a planarization process to remove oxide from 
the active areas and maintain oxide in the trenches. 
However, in some areas of the wafer face, there will be 
narrow trenches with narrow active areas between them, 
while in others there will be wide active areas and 
wider trenches. Various combinations of trench width 
and active area width occur, as well, at other places 
along the face of the wafer due to variations in circuit 
density. Because of these varying pattern densities, a 
sufficient degree of uniform planarization sometimes is 
not achieved. Improved planarity especially is 
important as device geometries shrink, reducing the 
photolithography depth of focus at subsequent patterning 
steps. Several techniques specifically have been developed 
for planarization of wafer surfaces as part of trench 
isolation processing. For example, conformal oxide 
deposition with etchback has been used successfully to 
produce local smoothing and planarization, but etching 
into the trenches does occur when the technique is 
applied to wide trenches. Another technique for 
planarization employs spin-on photoresist or glasses, 
followed by etchback; again, the smoothing is dependent 
upon the trench geometries, and global planarization is 
not achieved when variable circuit density is 
encountered.  
 While prior techniques have been able to produce 
adequate planarization over local regions, none of the 
techniques have been able to accomplish global 
planarization over large areas of diverse
