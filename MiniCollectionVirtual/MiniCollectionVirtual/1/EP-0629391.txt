<ABSTRACT>
An oxygen tank holder of a suitable fabric material includes a pouch 
(2) for holding an oxygen tank (8), and which pouch (2) is strapped at 

its upper and lower ends to the back of a wheelchair (30). The straps 
(10,12) are adjustable to accomodate various size wheelchairs and so 

that the pouch (2) can be displaced away from the center of the 
wheelchair (30) to avoid interfering with the back of the user of said 

chair, as is desireable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an oxygen tank holder for use 
with wheelchairs and, more particularly, to an oxygen tank 
holder of the type described which is of a suitable fabric 
material so as to be collapsible and which is supported by the 
wheelchair handle supports and the bottom frame of the chair. Patients suffering from respiratory ailments are often 
wheelchair bound for mobility purposes and must have oxygen 
readily available. It is thus imperative that an oxygen tank 
be coupled to the wheelchair so as to be moveable therewith. The present inventor is aware of the following prior art 
of interest: U.S. Patent 4,213,648 (U.S. Class 297/188) issued 
to Steichen on July 22, 1980; U.S. Patent 4,506,903 (U.S. Class 
280/289) issued to Bowermaster on March 26, 1985; U.S. Patent 
4,696,420 (U.S. Class 224/275) issued to Kulic on September 29, 
1987; U.S. Patent 4,431,206 (U.S. Class 280/289) issued to 
Pryor on February 14, 1984; and U.S. Patent 3,970,344 (U.S. 
Class 297/189) issued to Baumann on July 20, 1976. U.S. Patent 4,213,648 relates to a wheelchair having a 
rigid support frame for supporting an oxygen tank thereon. The 
support frame includes a holding device having a hollow 
cylinder with an open top end and a bottom closed end. The 
cylinder includes a mounting bracket for releasably attaching 
the cylinder to the spaced upwardly extending pins on the 
wheelchair frame conventionally used to mount detachable foot 
rests. U.S. Patent 4,506,903 relates to a device for detachably 
coupling a wheelchair oxygen tank cart to a wheelchair such 
that the cart and the chair are transportable together as a 
unit without the need of a separate operator for the cart. 
The oxygen tank cart is fixed at its upper end by a strap to the 
vertical handle support members of a wheelchair.  
 U.S. Patent 4,696,420 relates to a device for detachably 
coupling a rigid oxygen tank carrier to a wheelchair, wherein 
the device fits between the downwardly directed support arms of 
the chair with the carrier being made in different lengths, 
depending on the size of the chair. U.S. Patent 4,431,206 teaches an accessory carrier for 
oxygen bottles, intravenous containers and other medical 
accessories and to this extent includes a lower vertically 
extending post for detachable attachment to the back of the 
wheelchair so as to permit folding of the chair and further 
including an upper elongated vertical post for supporting 
additional accessories. U.S. Patent 3,970,344 teaches an oxygen tank holding 
device for

<CLAIMS>
An oxygen tank holder for use with a wheelchair (30) of the 
type having a pair of handle supports (32, 34) extending longitudinally 

along the back of the wheelchair (30) in transversely spaced 
relation and a pair of bottom frame members (38, 40) extending 

rearwardly of the wheelchair (30) in transversely spaced relation, 
characterised in that said holder comprises: 


a pouch (2) having an open top (4) and a closed bottom (6) for 
holding an oxygen tank (8); 
first strap means (10) secured to the pouch (2) near the open 
top (4) thereof and extending away therefrom in one direction; 
second strap means (12) secured to the pouch (2) near the open 
top (4) thereof and extending away therefrom in a direction 

opposite the one direction; 
first loop means (26) secured to the pouch (2) near the closed 
bottom (6) thereof and extending away therefrom generally in the 

direction of the first strap means (10); 
second loop means (28) secured to the pouch (2) near the 
closed bottom (6) thereof and extending away therefrom generally 

in the direction of the second strap means (12); whereby in use 
the first strap means (10) is disposed around one of the pair 
of wheelchair handle supports (32, 34) near the top thereof; 
the second strap means (12) is disposed around the other of the 
pair of wheelchair handle supports (32, 34) near the top thereof; 
the first loop means (26) is looped around one of the pair of 
bottom wheelchair frame members (38, 40); 
the second loop means (28) is looped around the other of the 
pair of bottom wheelchair frame members (38, 40); and 
said first and second strap means (10, 12) and said first 
and second loop means (26, 28) are cooperatively arranged on the 

respective first and second wheelchair handle support members 
(32, 34) and the respective first and second bottom wheelchair 

frame members (38, 40) for supporting the pouch (2) on the back of 
the wheelchair (30) so that the open top (4) of the pouch is in 

alignment with the closed bottom (6) thereof. 
An oxygen tank holder as claimed in claim 1 wherein: 

the lengths of the first and second strap means (10, 12) are 
adjustable and the length of one of the first and second loop 

means (26, 28) is longer than the length of the other said first 
and second loop means (26, 28), whereby said first and second strap 

means (10, 12) and said first and second loop means (26, 28) in use are 
cooperatively arranged on the respective wheelchair handle 

support members (32, 34) and the respective bottom wheelchair 
frame members (38, 40) to accommodate different transverse 

spacing between the handle support members (32, 34) and the bottom frame 
members (38, 40), and so that in use the pouch (2) can be displaced away from the 

centre of the wheelchair back with the alignment of the open 
pouch top (4) and the closed pouch bottom (6) being maintained. 
An oxygen tank holder as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
wherein each of the first and second strap means (10, 12) includes: 


a first strap member (10) and a first buckle member (14) 
associated therewith, said first strap member (10) being adjustable 

in length on said first buckle member (14); 
a tail (18) having a second buckle (22) member attached 
thereto; and 
 
   said first and second buckle members (14, 22) being in 

engaged relation when the strap means (10, 12) is disposed around a 
respective handle support. 
An oxygen tank holder as claimed in claims 1 to 3 wherein: 

the pouch (2), the first and second strap means (10, 12) and 
the first and second loop means (26, 28) are of a flexible fabric
