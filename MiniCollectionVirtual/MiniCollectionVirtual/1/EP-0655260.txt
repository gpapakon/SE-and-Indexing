<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus (1) detects the natural heart acceleration 
(NHA) isolating from it at least one period (t) 

corresponding to an isochoric phase such as the isochoric 
contraction (P1,P2) and/or the isochoric relaxation 

(P3,P4). Preferably the action of isolating the said 
period is carried out with the aid of the 

electrocardiograph (ECG) signal. The apparatus is 
usable, inter alia, to carry out stimulation (pacemaker, 

defibrillator, PCD) and/or to collect data, possibly 
telemetrically, on myocardiac function and/or for 

controlling a system for administering drugs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers in general to the determination of the
myocardial function by the use of accelerometric devices.U.S. Patent No. 5,304,208 and the corresponding EP-A-0 515 319,
after which the preambles of Claims 1 and 12 were patterned,
describe a pacemaker of the rate-responsive type which includes an
accelerometric sensor located in the pacing lead with the aim of making the
pacing rate of the device depend on a parameter obtained by processing the
signal of the Natural Heart Acceleration (NHA). U.S. Patent No. 5,304,208
discloses the analysis of the entire signal which describes the NHA, and in
particular the identification of the peak value, the calculation of the mean,
and the possible identification of the atrial and ventricular phases;
contemplating the utilization of the NHA signal for both single-chamber
and dual-chamber cardiac pacemakers, for antiarrhythmic pacing devices
and for implantable defibrillators, i.e., the so-called Pacer Cardioverter
Defibrillators (PCDs). U.S. Patent No. 5,304,208 differentiates the
principles of measuring acceleration from those of measuring the blood
pressure inside the ventricle and its derivative with respect to time. The
same considerations can be extended to U.S. Patent No. 4,936,304, where a
cardiac pacemaker of the rate-responsive type is assumed, in which the
pacing rate is regulated by the processing of intramyocardial stresses
measured by inserting inside the myocardium a pressure meter of the type
conceptually similar to the one used for measuring the ventricular blood 
pressure. Consequently, well documented from U.S. Patent No. 5,304,208
is the substantial difference existing between the measurement of
acceleration, where the accelerometric sensor is contained in an
undeformable capsule, and the pressure transducers that are equipped with a
deformable membrane which enables the pressure to be transduced into a
measurable force.The limitations in the use of the NHA signal according to the
procedure described in U.S. Patent No. 5,304,208 are based on the fact that,
since the cardiac mass is subject to overall movements deriving from
inertial reactions which are difficult to foresee and are due to the
simultaneous phases of aortic and pulmonary ejection, and in association
with these the movements themselves of the specific segment of
endocardium in which the lead is inserted with the accelerometer, it may
prove difficult from the mere reading of the accelerometric signal of NHA
as a whole, to deduce which part is due to the overall
