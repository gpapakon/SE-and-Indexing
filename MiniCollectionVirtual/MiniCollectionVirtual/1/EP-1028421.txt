<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-layered optical disc having its recording unit
comprised of plural information recording layers. More particularly, it relates to a
multi-layered optical disc having its information recording layer formed of a phase
change material.Recently, as so-called multi-media are becoming popular, a demand is raised
for an optical recording medium handling a large volume of the information, such as
a digital moving picture, such that the necessity of storing the large volume of the
information and having a random access thereto as necessary for recording and/or
reproduction is increasing.Among the random-accessible recording mediums, there is an optical recording
medium of a large storage capacity which is removable, that is can be taken out from
the recording and/or reproducing apparatus. This optical recording medium is used in
large quantities in many fields.Under these circumstances, an optical recording medium on one surface of
which recording and/or reproduction for four hours is possible in accordance with the
NTSC (National Television System Committee) system. In this optical recording medium, it is targeted to enable recording and/or
reproduction for four hours, as a video disc player for home use, to provide a function
as a new recording medium which takes the place of the video tape recorder now in
prevalent use. Moreover, the optical recording medium may be of the same shape and
size as the digital audio disc, having the music data recorded thereon, to prove a
product more benign to a user accustomed to a digital audio disc.Meanwhile, a demand is raised for an optical recording medium capable of
handling a still larger information volume, such that the optical recording medium is
required to have a still larger storage volume.For example, the optical recording medium, capable of recording and/or
reproduction in accordance with the NTSC system, is required not only to be in a disc
shape to exploit the high accessing speed proper to the disc shape to provide a simple
and small-sized recording medium, but also to be of a large storage capacity to have
multiple functions such as instant reproduction of a recorded picture, trick play or
editing.In order to have these variegated functions, the capacity not less than 8 GB is
required. However, there lacks up to now an optical recording medium capable of
realizing this large storage capacity by the following reason:In the already proposed replay-only DVD (digital versatile disc), the wavelength
λ is 0.65 µm, with the
