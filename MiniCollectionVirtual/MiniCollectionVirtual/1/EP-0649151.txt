<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bulk high-temperature
superconductive magnet with freely variable strength of
magnetic field obtainable by combining a high-temperature
superconductive bulk form with high critical current with a
superconductive coil, which allows the
stabilization of conventional superconductive coil and the
more extended application of superconductive magnet. The
magnet with this structure is utilizable for, for example, the
stabilization of superconductive coil for magnetic levitated
train, etc.With the discovery of oxide superconductor represented by
R-Ba-Cu-O type (R denotes rare-earth elements, hereinafter it
means the same) with critical temperature (Tc) exceeding 90 K,
it has become possible to use liquid nitrogen as a coolant for
superconductor. For putting the superconductor into practice,
it is required to process this into a wire, tape or the like.
It is the status quo however that, in this form, the critical
current being most important in the practice of superconductor
is low and has not reached the practical level at 77 K.For example, Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O type superconductor is
relatively easy to process into a tape. Thus, a tape with a
length exceeding 100 m has already been made and a pancake
coil that generates a magnetic field exceeding 1 T at 20 K is 
manufactured, but it exhibits only around 0.1 T at a temperature
of liquid nitrogen at most.In the case of Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O type material, the
anisotropy is significant in the crystal structure and, while
the critical current is relatively high when applying the
magnetic field perpendicularly to the c-axis of crystal, it
becomes very low when applying parallel, which is considered
to be a problematic point at the time of using liquid
nitrogen.On the other hand, with R-Ba-Cu-O type superconductor
made by melt process, the optimization of flux pinning effect
has been achieved though in the state of bulk, and very high
critical current at practical level is achieved even at a
temperature of liquid nitrogen. Such bulk form exhibits a
high repulsive force and attractive force through the interaction
with magnetic field, hence application to bearing etc.
is investigated. Moreover, trapping of magnetic field is also
possible, leading to a magnetic field exceeding 1 T at a
temperature of liquid nitrogen.With the conventional superconductor, if attempting to use it
in bulk form, the so-called quenching phenomenon, in which the
superconductivity is broken abruptly by a small external disturbance,
occurred because of low specific heat,
