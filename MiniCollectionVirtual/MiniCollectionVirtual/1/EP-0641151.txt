<ABSTRACT>
Contaminants are cleaned from the surface (94) of a body 
(92) in space by generating (104a) a substantially space-charge 

neutral reactive plasma, directing the plasma onto the contaminated 
surface (94) at an energy below the surface sputtering 

energy (typically 20 eV), and reacting the plasma with the 
contaminants to remove them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of cleaning a
contaminant from a surface of a body in space, comprising
the steps of:
generating a substantially space-charge neutral
plasma of a type that reacts with said
contaminant;directing said plasma onto said contaminated
surface at an energy below the surface sputtering
energy of said body; andreacting said plasma with said contaminant to
remove the contaminant from said surface.Such a cleaning method is known from US-A-4,088,926.
The invention relates further to a method of
neutralizing a localized charge on a surface of a body in
space, comprising the steps of:
generating a substantially space-charge neutral
plasma; anddirecting a portion of said plasma of opposite
charge to said localized charge onto said
surface, at an energy below the surface
sputtering energy of said body, to neutralize
said localized charge,
   wherein said plasma is generated within a plasma tube
by:
establishing an axial magnetic field through said
tube,directing a plasma source gas through said tube,
andinitiating a plasma within said tube from said
source gas.Such a neutralizing method is known from US-A-4,800
281. The invention relates further to an rf plasma source,
comprising:
a plasma tube;a gas feed into said tube;a magnet structure establishing a generally axial
magnetic field within said tube; andan rf antenna for generating electromagnetic
helicon waves within said tube to sustain a
plasma within said tube, said antenna comprising:
a pair of axially spaced conductive rings
extending around said tube, said rings being
electrically connected and dividing an rf
current symmetrically and recombining said
current to substantially avoid generating a
net axial rf field through said tube.Finally, the invention relates to an rf antenna of an
rf plasma source for generating electromagnetic helicon
waves within said plasma source to sustain a plasma within
said plasma source, comprising:
a pair of conductive rings of substantially
equal inner diameters, said rings being
electrically connected,a conductive base line connecting said rings
along a common axis at its opposite ends;
anda conductive rf feed line extending between
said rings and diametrically opposed to said
base line, said feed line including an
interruption and an rf signal receiver on
opposite sides of said interruption.Such an rf plasma source and such an rf antenna of an
rf plasma source are known from EP-A-0 403 418. This invention relates generally to rf plasma sources and the
use of such sources for cleaning surfaces
