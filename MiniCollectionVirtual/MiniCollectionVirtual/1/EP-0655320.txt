<ABSTRACT>
An article of manufacture in the form of a shaped sheet, 
comprising

 
50-90% by weight of PET,

 
5-20% by weight of a "rubber",

 
10-45% by weight of an inert filler,

 
and having a crystallinity gradient such that said shaped sheet 

maintains the shape, under its own weight, up to a temperature 
of at least 70°C and has impact strength which is substantially 

greater compared to that of the fully crystallized shaped 
sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article of manufacture
in the form of a polyethylene terephthalate shaped sheet and a
method for producing it. More particularly, it relates to a
shaped sheet, for use in the building industry, which has different
structural and mechanical properties at different depths of its
thickness.It is known that polyethylene terephthalate (PET) now
constitutes the plastic material of choice for producing
containers for drinks due to the fact that it does not release
potentially toxic substances into the contents.It is also known that current regulations do not allow the
abovementioned containers to be reused.Therefore large quantities of disposable PET containers are
being accumulated.In this description and the subsequent claims, the PET of
the aforementioned disposable containers is indicated by the
term "recycled PET".The Italian Patent Application No. MI91 A 002949 filed on
November 6, 1991 pointed out the uneconomical nature of the
methods proposed to date for disposing of the abovementioned
containers (incineration or depolymerisation and recovery of
the monomers) and proposed recycling polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) by extruding it into shaped sheets for building.In particular, the abovementioned application proposed
washing PET containers, crushing them and drying them
thoroughly up to a moisture content of from 20 to 50 ppm. The 
resulting material was then crystallized, mixed with an inert
mineral filler and extruded in flat sheets. Finally, the latter
could be shaped in the form of corrugated sheets or other
profiles, for example fretted, by conventional machines and
techniques.The shaped sheets obtained in this way were however found
to be highly crystallized, with poor elasticity and low impact
strength, a sheet with thickness of 3 mm breaking on the impact
of a cylindrical striking mass, with spherical head and
weighing 2 kg, from a height of only 0.2 m .The Japanese Patent Application Opened No. 92,536/83
describes a biaxially-oriented plastic bottle comprising a
bottom portion, a body portion, a shoulder portion and a neck
portion formed by biaxially-oriented blow molding a parison of
virgin polyethylene terephthalate, wherein said neck portion
has a highly crystallized outer surface layer with density of
no less than 1.36 g/cc, and a less crystallized inner surface
layer with density of no more than 1.35 g/cc.In order to achieve such crystallization the outer surface
of the neck portion is heated at 180°C for 30 seconds to 1
minute while the inner neck
