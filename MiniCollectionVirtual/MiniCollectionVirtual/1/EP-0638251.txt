<ABSTRACT>
In an air intake device (5) in a helmet, a housing 
(11) is moulded as one piece from a synthetic resin 

material and as an upper wall, a lower wall, a left end 
wall and a right end wall. First and second recesses 

(17, 18) are defined in the back surface of the upper 
wall and in the front surface of the lower wall, 

respectively, so as to communicate with each other to 
define a shutter chamber (21). Wind guide sleeves (19, 

19) are formed on the lower wall which wind guide sleeves 
are opened and closed by a shutter plate (12) which is 

vertically accommodated in the shutter chamber (21). The 
housing (11) of the shutter as part of the air intake 

device (5) in the cap body (1) is formed of a single 
piece of a synthetic resin, thereby providing a 

simplified structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention is air intake
devices in helmets for use mainly by an occupant on a
motorcycle or a racing car, and particularly, improvements
in air intake devices in helmets, of a type having a
shutter means mounted to a front surface of a cap body, the
shutter means including a housing having a wind guide
sleeve for permitting air to be introduced into an
air duct in the cap body, and a shutter plate vertically
movably accommodated in the housing for opening and closing
the air duct.Such air intake devices in helmets are already known,
as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model
Publication No. 89517/92.The shutter means of the prior art air intake device
has its housing constructed of a base plate and a cover
coupled to a front surface of the base plate, and a shutter
chamber for accommodating the shutter plate is defined
between the base plate and the cover. A housing constructed
from two parts in this manner requires many fabrication steps,
such as moulding the two parts and coupling them, resulting in
an inevitable increase in cost. Accordingly, the present invention seeks to
provide an inexpensive air intake device for a helmet,
wherein the housing of the shutter means can be formed
of a single piece.EP-A-0515752 describes an air intake device having
the precharacterizing features of claim 1.According to the present invention the housing of
the air intake device is moulded as one piece from a
synthetic resin material;
a first recess is provided in a back surface of
the upper wall of the housing and a second recess is
provided in a front surface of the lower wall, said
first and second recesses cooperating with each other
to define said shutter chamber; andthe guide groove is provided on the lower wall,
the guide claw projects from the back surface of the
shutter plate, and the wind guide sleeve is mounted on
the lower wall.In certain embodiments, the wind guide sleeve may
comprise a plurality of wind guide sleeves which are
laterally spaced from each other.With the above construction, the housing can be formed
of a single piece, and the mounting of the shutter plate
can be easily performed, leading to a reduced number of
parts and to a facilitated assembling of the parts. This
largely contributes to a reduction in cost of producing the
shutter means.For a better understanding of the present invention,
reference will now be made, by way of example, to the
accompanying drawings, in which:-
