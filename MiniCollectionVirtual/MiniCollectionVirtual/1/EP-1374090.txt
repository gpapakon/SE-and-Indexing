<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for transporting data for a data warehousing application. Data is extracted from one or more source containing data having a standard data structure and is translated into data that contains meaningful business terms. The translated data is then stored. In the present embodiment, an analytic business component is operable for extracting data from the source, translating the extracted data and for storing the translated data into a staging area. The translated data is then processed to obtain data having a common structure. In the present embodiment, a source adapter processes the translated data to obtain data having a common structure. The data having a common structure is then transformed into a format suitable for loading into a data mart. In the present embodiment, an analytic data interface receives the data having a common structure and transforms the data for loading into a data warehouse. The data is then stored in a data warehouse.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPUTER METHOD AND DEVICE FOR TRANSPORTING DATAFIELDThe present disclosure relates to database systems. More particularly, the present disclosure pertains to an apparatus and method for transporting data for a data warehousing application. Even more specifically, this disclosure teaches both a method and apparatus for transporting data for data warehousing applications that incorporates analytic data interface.BACKGROUNDDue to the increased amounts of data being stored and processed today, operational databases are constructed, categorized, and formatted in a manner conducive for maximum throughput, access time, and storage capacity. Unfortunately, the raw data found in these operational databases often exist as rows and columns of numbers and code which appears bewildering and incomprehensible to business analysts and decision makers. Furthermore, the scope and vastness of the raw data stored in modern databases renders it harder to analyze. Hence, applications were developed in an effort to help interpret, analyze, and compile the data so that a business analyst may readily and easily understand it. This is accomplished by mapping, sorting, and summarizing the raw data before it is presented for display. Thereby, individuals can now interpret the data and make key decisions based thereon. 

 Extracting raw data from one or more operational databases and transforming it into useful information is the function of data "warehouses" and data "marts." In data warehouses and data marts, the data is structured to satisfy decision support roles rather than operational needs. Before the data is loaded into the target data warehouse or data mart, the corresponding source data from an operational database is filtered to remove extraneous and erroneous records; cryptic and conflicting codes are resolved; raw data is translated into something more meaningful; and summary data that is useful for decision support, trend analysis or other end-user needs is pre-calculated. In the end, the data warehouse is comprised of an analytical database containing data useful for decision support. A data mart is similar to a data warehouse, except that it contains a subset of corporate data for a single aspect of business, such as finance, sales, inventory, or human resources. With data warehouses and data marts, useful information is retained at the disposal of the decision-makers.However, establishing a structure for transporting (extracting, transporting and loading) data from an operational database or databases into a

CLAIMS
1. A computer implemented method for transporting data in a data warehousing application, comprising the steps of: b) translating said data to form translated data containing meaningful business terms; c) loading said translated data into a staging area; d) processing said translated data to obtain data having a common structure; e) transforming said data having a common structure into a format suitable for loading into a data warehouse.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein the method is caused to perform by means of a computer readable media.
3. The method of claim 1 or 2 further comprising the steps of a) extracting data from at least one source containing data having a standard data structure; f) storing the data transformed in step e). 

4. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said at least one analytic business component encapsulates extraction logic as data is moved from said data source.
5. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein step c) further comprises: d) denormalizing at least some of said translated data; c2) joining tables from said translated data; c3) normalizing at least some of said translated data; and c4) cleansing said translated data.
6. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein step d) further comprises converting source-specific terminology into analytic data interface terminology.
7. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 6 wherein step d) further comprises performing source specific configuration by setting data indicators and choosing a set of rows that will be put into said data warehouse. 

8. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 7 wherein step d) further comprises d1 ) combining extract-specific staging area objects; d2) providing a common way to flag a record to be deleted; and d3) performing data type conversions.
9. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 8 wherein said data type conversion is performed by publishing the structure of each field and converting said data type using a consistent approach.
10. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 3 wherein step e) further comprises cleaning data by enforcing commonalties in dates, names and other data types.
11. A computer implemented method as recited in Claim 3 wherein step e) further comprises e1) consolidating business concepts across an entire value change into integrated structures that are suitable for querying and reporting; and e2) normalizing source definition differences into a single common definition. 

12. A system for transporting data to a data warehouse comprising: at least one staging area, said at least one staging area adapted to store data; at least one analytic business component coupled to a data source and coupled to said at least one staging area, said analytic business component for translating operational data from said data source into translated data containing meaningful business terms; at least one source adapter coupled to said at least one staging area for processing said translated data to obtain data having a common structure; and an analytic data interface coupled to said source adapter and adapted to receive said data having a common structure, said analytic data interface transforming data for loading into a data warehouse.
13. A system as recited in Claim 12 wherein said at least one staging area is one or more target in a warehouse designer that includes staging area tables.
14. A system as recited in Claim 12 wherein said at least one analytic business component is source-specific and wherein said at least one analytic business component includes at least one maplet in a warehouse designer.
