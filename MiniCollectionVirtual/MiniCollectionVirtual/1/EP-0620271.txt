<ABSTRACT>
A microemulsion cleaning composition having superior solubilizing power and 
cleaning performance and low concentration of active ingredients has been 

developed which comprises an organic anionic surface active agent together with an 
optional nonionic surfactant, an electrolyte, alkylene glycol monoalkyl ether surfactant 

and water. The monoalkyl moiety of the alkylene glycol ether surfactant must have at 
least six carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microemulsion cleaning compositions having 
enhanced degrees of oil uptake and superior cleaning performance and in particular 
to cleaning compositions that leave lower surface residues following their use. Liquid detergent compositions in emulsion form have been employed as all-purpose 
detergents for cleaning hard surfaces, such as, painted woodwork, bathtubs, 
sinks, tile floors, tiled walls, linoleum, paneling and washable wallpaper. Taking 
advantage of the mechanism of soil removal by emulsification, microemulsions were 
developed as a more efficient method of removing lipophilic/materials from substrates. 
These microemulsions include a lipophile, a surfactant, a cosurfactant and water. 
They are a thermodynamically stable phase in which the micelles have a particle size 
of less than 100nm (nanometers), are transparent with no Tyndall scattering and do 
not separate over long periods of time. Microemulsions can solubilize oil without the 
use of expensive hydrotropes or vigorous mixing. They show very low interfacial 
tensions with oil and so will spread on soil surfaces aiding cleaning. Microemulsions have certain disadvantages which make their application to 
practical problems difficult and often unpredictable. For example, in order to apply this 
technology to a particular problem, it is necessary to determine the ternary phase 
diagram for said system. In addition careful consideration must be taken of the 
surfactant and cosurfactant to be used. Microemulsions are sensitive to electrolytes 
and the phase behavior of each system must be well understood when diluting it. 
They are sensitive to oil chain length and foaming at high concentrations of surfactant.  M. Loth et al in U.S. 5,075,026 and in U.S. 5,082,584 disclosed an 
improvement in microemulsion compositions containing an anionic detergent, a 
cosurfactant, a hydrocarbon and water comprising the use of a water-insoluble 
odoriferous perfume as the essential hydrocarbon ingredient. The cosurfactants of 
this reference have substantially no ability to dissolve oily or greasy soil and are 
selected from the group consisting of, among other entities, water-soluble alkanols 
have 3 to 4 carbon atoms, polypropylene glycol ethers, and monoalkyl ethers and 
esters of ethylene glycol or propylene glycol having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. M. Loth et al in U.S. 5,076,954 delineated a concentrated stable, 
microemulsion, cleaning composition comprising synthetic organic detergent, 
cosurfactant, water and water-insoluble
