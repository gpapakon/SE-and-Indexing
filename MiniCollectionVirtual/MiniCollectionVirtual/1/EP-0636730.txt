<ABSTRACT>
Device for the positioning of two stockings in a machine for the production of tights and comprising a pair of twin horizontal flat forms (5) which serve as a support to the stockings (5), the said device comprising: - gripper means (1) for gripping a limited lateral portion of the fabric of each stocking (4) slipped onto the corresponding supporting form (5), this taking place in coincidence with a lateral edge of the form (5); - means for supporting and driving the said gripper means (1) in the direction orthogonal to the longitudinal axis (8) of the form (5), between a retracted start-of-travel position and an advanced end-of-travel position coinciding with the said form, and vice versa, with a pneumatic cylinder (2) of horizontal axis, orthogonal to the axis (8) of the form (5); - cam means (3) for activating the respective gripping and release of the stocking (4) by the said gripper means (1); - at least one optical sensor (13) for each form (5), which optical sensor is arranged in coincidence with a predetermined position of alignment of the garter lines of the two stockings (4) and is associated with the cylinder (2) for driving the gripper (1) relative to the corresponding form (5), in order to command its deactivation of the end of the positioning.

Process for positioning two stockings in vertical alignment 
with the respective garter lines in a machine for the manufacture of tights, 

and comprising an initial phase which consists of the operation of 
provisionally slipping each stocking (4) over a corresponding support 

form (5), characterized by the fact that it includes the following further 
phases: 


selecting and retaining a limited lateral position of 
the fabric of each stocking (4), corresponding to the 

two lateral edges of the relevant form (5); 
retracting once or more the said retained position of 
each stocking (4) in the centrifugal transveral 

direction in relation to the longitudinal axis (8) 
of the corresponding form (5), over a sufficient 

length to enable the stitches forming the elastic 
fabric of the stocking to be drawn and to enable that 

position of the stocking which includes the garter line 
(14) to be subsequently returned in the direction of 

the longitudinal axis (8) of thus form, until the 
said garter line occupies the predetermined position 

in relation to the form (5), and finally 
releasing each stocking (4) with the garter line (14) 
thus positioned. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that the said retraction of the lateral positions of the fabric 

of each stocking (4) is carried out in the direction (F1) which is oblique 
in relation to the axis (8) of the corresponding form (5). 
Device for positioning two stockings in a machine for 
manufacturing tights in accordance with the process described in Claim 1,  

 
comprising a pair of coupled horizontal flat forms (5) serving as a support 

for the stockings, characterized by the fact that it comprises 

clamping means (1) for gripping a limited lateral 
portion of the fabric of each stocking (4) fitted 

onto the corresponding support form (5), thus being 
effected in the position corresponding to a lateral 

edge of the form (5); 
means for supporting and driving the said clamping 
means (1) in the direction orthogonal in relation in 

relation to the longitudinal axis (8) of the form (5), 
between a retracted initial position at the beginning 

of the travel and an advanced end-of-travel position 
corresponding to the said form and vice versa, with 

a pneumatic cylinder (2) with a horizontal axis, 
orthogonal to the axis (8) of the form (5); 
cam means (3) for activating the respective operations 
of gripping and releasing the stocking (4) by the said 

clamping means (1); 
at least one optical pick-up (13) for each form (5), 
positioned in a manner corresponding to predetermined 

alignment position of the garter lines of the two 
stockings (4), and associated with the driving cylinder 

(2) of the clamp (1) relating to the corresponding form 
(5) in order to de-activate it on the completion of the 

positioning operation. 
Device in accordance with Claim 3, characterized by the 
fact that the said clamping means (1) are subjected to an alternating 

traversing movement in the direction (F1) which is oblique in relation 
to the longitudinal axis (8) of the corresponding form (5). 
Device in accordance with Claim 4, characterized by the 
fact that the said clamp (1) is of the type having flat jaws (15) which  

 
are normally closed. 
Device in accordance with Claims 3 and 4, characterized 
by the fact that it comprises a thrust element (6) interposed between 

the head of the clamp (1) and the corresponding control cylinder (2) 
in such a way as to limit the operational return travel of the clamp 

(1) and exert a thrust on the back of each jaw (15) and bring about 
the opening of the clamp (1) and the release of the stocking (4). 
Device in accordance with Claim 3, characterized by 
the fact that it includes an elastic blade (10) which straddles the 

jaws (15) of the said clamp (1) longitudinally in such a way as to 
enable it to be automatically closed in the position of rest. 
Device in accordance with Claim 3, characterized by 
the fact that the said cam (3) has a rectilinear double profile 

diverging symmetrically in the direction of the support form (5) of 
the stocking (4), in order to activate, i.e. open and close respectively 

the said clamp (1), in co-operation with two shafts (11) each of which 
is mounted loose in a corresponding join (15) of the clamp (1), in such 

a way as to project laterally in relation to this latter and thus to 
interact with a corresponding profile of the cam (3) during the 

displacement of the clamp (1), the said cam (3) being interposed between 
the cylinder (2) for moving the clamp (1) and the support form 5 of the 

stocking (4).
