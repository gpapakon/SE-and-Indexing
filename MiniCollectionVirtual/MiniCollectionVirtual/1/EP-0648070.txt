<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the present invention is to specify a mechanical connection (joint) of two telecommunications apparatuses (1, 2), which connection allows the apparatuses (1, 2) to be joined together and detached easily. This is achieved in that, in mutually adjacent edge regions (3) of the apparatuses (1, 2) which are to be connected, guide and latching elements (5, 6) are provided in the first apparatus (1), which guide and latching elements (5, 6) interact with receptacles (15) and mating latches which are arranged in the second apparatus (2) and whose shape corresponds to them.

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement having at least two telecommunications 
devices (1, 2) which are arranged next to one 

another and are mechanically connected to one another, 
characterized in that there are provided, in mutually 

adjacent edge regions (3) of the devices (1, 2) in the 
first device (1) guide and catch elements (5, 6), which 

are detachably connected to receptacles (15) and mating 
catches which are arranged in the second device (2) and 

correspond to the said guide and catch elements (5, 6) in 
terms of shape. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the guide elements are formed by retaining webs 

(5) and the catch elements are formed by catch hooks (6) 
which form U-shaped receptacles in each case with a 

continuous projection (7) of the device (1). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that angled regions (8, 10) of the housing components 

of the two devices (1, 2) engage in the U-shaped receptacles. 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the catch hooks (6) engage in receptacles (15) 

which are bounded by catch webs (14). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the respective device (1, 2) comprises a bottom 

pan (4, 11) and an upper housing component (9) which is 
connected to the bottom pan (4, 11), the retaining webs 

(5) and catch hooks (6) being arranged on the bottom pan 
(4, 11) in the edge region (3) while the upper housing 

part (9) has angled end regions (8, 10) which, in the 
assembled state of the devices (1, 2) engage in the  

 
aforesaid U-shaped receptacles. 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the catch hooks (6) are provided between retaining 

webs (5) in each case.
