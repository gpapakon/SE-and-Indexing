<ABSTRACT>
In the method, the warp threads are guided via the fabric take-up device and introduced into a brush beam (11) and are subsequently ordered and tensioned uniformly by means of the brush beam. The warp threads are thereafter brought into operative engagement with the switching beam (1) and the run-in and run-off rollers (3, 4), with the tension being maintained. The brush roller is subsequently removed. The article change is concluded by the tensioning of the warp threads by means of the warp switching drive according to the control programme of the weaving machine. This method requires no aid for the start of weaving, such as a knotting cloth for the welding foil.
