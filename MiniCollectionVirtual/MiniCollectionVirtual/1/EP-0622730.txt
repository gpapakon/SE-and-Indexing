<ABSTRACT>
An operating system provides support for the 
encapsulation of extracted portions of documents into objects 

known as scrap objects and subsequently integrated into other 
documents. The scrap objects may be treated like any other 

file system objects. The scrap objects provide a persistent 
storage mechanism for extracted portions of documents that are 

transferred between applications. Scrap object may be created 
using either a clipboard mechanism or a drag-and-drop 

mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present method relates to a method for use in a data processing system for
improved transfer of document portions between applications.The Microsoft Windows, Version 3.1, operating
system, sold by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond,
Washington, provides a clipboard program for transferring
selected information between applications. The clipboard
temporarily holds the selected information as it is
transferred from one application to another. In general,
the clipboard is activated by a user selecting a "Copy" or
a "Cut" command. These commands store a block of text, a
graphic image or some other kind of information on the
clipboard. Subsequently, the user selects a "Paste"
command to transfer the information from the clipboard to
the destination application. The clipboard retains its
correct contents until the user replaces the contents or
explicitly requests that the contents of the clipboard be
deleted. The lack of persistency of the information
stored in the clipboard poses a problem. Users often
inadvertently delete the contents of the clipboard by
transferring other information to the clipboard. From EP-A-0312480, a method for transfer of data is known, according to which a
portion of a document is displayed on a video display of a data processing system
having a memory and at least one processor, information to be extracted from the
portion of the document that is displayed on the video display is selected and the
selected information is extracted from the document.It is the object of the present invention to provide an improved method for transferring
portions of the documents between applications.This object is solved by the subject matter of claim 1. Preferred embodiments are the
subject matter of the dependent claims.A preferred embodiment to the present invention
will be described with reference to the drawings, which
include the following figures.
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a data processing
system suitable for implementing the preferred embodiment
of the present invention.  Figure 2 is a flowchart illustrating the step
performed to create a scrap object using the drag-and-drop
mechanism of the preferred embodiment of the present
invention. Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating the
appearance of the video display of Figure 1 during the
creation of a scrap object using the drag-and-drop
mechanism. Figure 4 is a flowchart illustrating the steps
performed to create a scrap object using a clipboard

<CLAIMS>
A method for use in a data processing system (10) having a video display (20),
a memory (14) holding objects, and a processor (12) running an object-oriented

operating system (22), displaying a portion of a document on the video display (20),
and extracting selected information from the portion of the document that is displayed

on the video display (20), the method comprising the steps of:

providing a document portion object class;
accessing a document portion object class; and
creating an instance of the document portion object class to encapsulate the
selected information into a separate object.
The method of claim 1 wherein the operating system (22) provides a drag-and-drop
mechanism, and the step of extracting the selected information further comprises

the step of using the drag-and-drop mechanism to drag the selected information from
the document and drop the selected information at a drop target.
The method of claim 1 wherein the operating system (22) includes a clipboard
(24), and the step of extracting the information further comprises the step of using a

clipboard (24) to transfer the selected information from the document to the object.
The method of claim 1 wherein the extracted information is textual information.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of displaying an icon (52) for
the object holding the selected information. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the data processing system (10) further
comprises a pointing device (16) and wherein the step of extracting the selected

information from the document comprises the steps of:

using the pointing device to drag the selected information to a drop target; and
using the pointing device to drop the selected information at the drop target.
The method as recited in claim 6, further comprising the step of displaying an
icon (52) for the object holding the selected information from the document.
The method of claim 3, wherein the step of extracting the selected information
from the document comprises the steps of:


transferring the selected information to the clipboard (24); and
transferring the selected information from the clipboard (24) to a destination.
The method of claim 8, further comprising the step of displaying an icon (52) for
the object holding the selected information from the document on the video display

(20) after the step of encapsulating.
The method according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising the
step o
f integrating the selected information that is encapsulated in the object into a
destination document.
The method according to any of the preceding claims wherein the step of
integrating the selected information further comprises the step of integrating the

selected information that is encapsulated in the object to the same document from
which it was extracted. 
The method according to any of the preceding claims, further comprising the
step of giving the object a name by which it may be referenced wherein the name is

descriptive of the selected information.
