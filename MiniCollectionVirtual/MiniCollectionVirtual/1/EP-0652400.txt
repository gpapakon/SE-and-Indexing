<ABSTRACT>
A light pattern generator includes a reflective layer absorptive to infra-red 
radiation from which a desired pattern has been removed to allow passage of a light beam 

in the shape of the pattern. A method for making a light pattern generator includes forming 
a layer of reflective material on a transparent substrate and ablating a portion of the layer 

with a laser to create a desired pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to stage lighting equipment, particularly but not
exclusively to a method and apparatus for making a gobo for use in such
equipment.A significant feature of stage lighting systems is the projection of images by
stage lighting instruments. Images are typically formed by passing a light beam
through a light pattern generator or "gobo" and projecting the image formed
thereby. A typical gobo is made of a sheet of metal which has the desired image
cut from the sheet to form an opening for shaping a light beam passing
therethrough. A gobo therefore operates as a light stencil, blocking some portions
of the light beam and passing other portions. A typical configuration for creating a
pattern of light consists of a gobo placed in a projection gate located at a focal
plane of a light projector having a light source, a reflector which focuses light rays
to the focal plane, and one or more lenses to project an image formed at the focal
plane.Conventional gobos are limited as to the images that can be produced.
Since all of the metal elements of a gobo must be supported, there must often be
unwanted support members included in the design. As an example, it is impossible
to produce a complete ring design because support members must extend from the
exterior to support the interior metal. Many conventional gobos are stamped out of sheet metal, which makes them
very inexpensive when produced in large quantities. The gobos are mounted directly in the
intense light beams used in stage lighting, and can become hot enough to glow with a cherry
red color. The intense heat produced by the light beam is absorbed by the metal gobo and
causes it to soften, warp, and therefore distort the desired image. Some gobos include very
thin connecting links supporting internal metal portions of the light stencil from the exterior
portions. These thin connecting links, however, are particularly susceptible to damage from
the heat of the beam, and under some circumstances can burn through completely, such that
the image is severely distorted and the gobo destroyed.In an effort to produce heat-tolerant gobos, some gobos have been made of
heat resistant materials, such as stainless steel, using a laser beam to cut out the desired
image. However, even gobos made of these materials have a relatively short lifetime and
require frequent replacement. Although the laser-cutting process can produce more complex
images than can be stamped, these images are usually characterized by a greater quantity of
very thin
