<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for washing laundry in a counterflow continuous-batch washing machine with a drum divided into chambers and with partition walls perforated in regions or a casing perforated in regions, at least two treatment regions (1,2,3) being formed, in each case, from one or more chambers and the laundry being transported in timed sequence from one chamber into the adjacent chamber. During the transport of a laundry batch in the transitional region from one treatment region (2), for example a clear-washing region, into the next treatment region (3), for example the rinsing region, some of the washing liquor (bath) transported together with the laundry batch is drained off. It is thereby possible to save rinsing fluid which would otherwise be necessary for rinsing out the washing liquor carried along.
