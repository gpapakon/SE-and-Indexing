<ABSTRACT>
The device is intended to ensure that separation of the bottle closing element forcibly occurs when the closing process has been completed. To achieve this, in the case of the device for closing bottles with crown caps, there are fastened closing elements (1) to the circumference of a closing machine upper part in guide bushes (2) in a vertically movable fashion. In the closing element (1) there is centrally arranged a spring loaded cylindrical holding down device (10) in a closing element casing (6), the holding down device (10) having a holding down device headpiece (13) at its upper end. Immediately on conclusion of the closing process, this holding down device is made, by the holding down device headpiece (13), to come to rest against a stationary radial cam (4), and is therefore prevented from executing an upward movement taking the form of a forced movement in relation to the closing element casing (6).
