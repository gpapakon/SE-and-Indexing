<ABSTRACT>
Device for clamping pipes in manual pipe cutters, of the type which, on the head of the pipe cutter, have two support points for the pipe, a cam (2) of the type pivoting on the head (h) of the pipe cutter in order to bear on the pipe in the working position and a toothed pawl (24) for engaging with a ratchet tooth (3) and a spring (4) between the cam and the head of the pipe cutter, tending to position the cam in the open position.

<CLAIMS>
Device for clamping pipes on manual pipe 
cutters of the type having, on the head of the pipe 

cutter, two supporting points for the pipe 
characterised in that the head (h) of the pipe cutter 

has a swivel-mounted: 

a) cam (2) of which the head is used as a 
support in the position when working on the pipe (T) 

and is provided with a toothed ratchet (24), 
b) a pawl (3), intended to latch with said 
toothed ratchet (24). 
Device for clamping pipes on manual pipe 
cutters as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that 

said cam is built onto an elongated one-piece body, one 
end of which configures the support head (21) whereas 

the opposite end forks into two arms (22-23) which 
extend either side of the pipe-cutter head on which the 

cam is swivel-mounted. 
Device for clamping pipes on manual pipe 
cutters as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that 

said pawl (3) is built onto an extended one-piece body, 
one end of which configures a knurled head (32) that is 

broadened in comparison with the body and accommodated 
in a cavity (11) joined to the pipe-cutter head on 

which it is hinge-mounted. 
Device for clamping pipes on manual pipe 
cutters as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that 

there is a pre-formed arc-shaped dip (25) along one of 
the sides of the cam in order to make it into a fixed 

limit-stop guide emerging from the body of the pipe 
cutter.  

 
Device for clamping pipes on manual pipe 
cutters as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that a 

spring (4) is fitted between the cam and pipe-cutter 
head and the spring tends to keep the cam in the opened 

position.
