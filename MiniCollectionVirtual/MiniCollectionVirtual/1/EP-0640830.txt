<ABSTRACT>
Detector and method for detecting the presence of a 
liquid, in particular of water dew and/or of ice, 

and/or for detecting a change of phase in the liquid, 
which detector is based on a change in the electrical 

resistance. The detector comprises a substrate (10, 
11), onto whose face one or several resistor patterns 

(15,16) have been applied. In view of detecting the 
presence of a liquid or ice or equivalent on the basis 

of a change in the detector resistance (R
det
), a low-mass 
detector resistor pattern (15) has been applied 

onto a substrate (10,11) out of such a metal or 
equivalent as has a considerable dependence on 

temperature. On the substrate, there are contact 
patterns (12,13), by whose means an electric current 

(I) that heats the detector resistor (R
det
) is fed into 
the detector resistor (R
det
) as a short pulse (t₀), the 
presence of a liquid or ice and/or a change of phase 

in same being detected on the basis of the change in 
resistance (R
det
) taking place during said short 
pulse. The thickness s of the metal film in the resistor 

pattern (15) of the detector resistor (R
det
) is, as 
a rule, chosen as s 
<
 1 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a detector for detecting the presence of water in the form of water
dew or ice, which detector comprises a substrate, a low-mass detector resistor pattern being
applied onto the substrate out of a material having a characteristic substantially dependent on
temperature, on said substrate, there being contact patterns by whose means an electric current
that heats the detector resistor is fed into the detector resistor as a short pulse, the presence of
water being detected by the change in resistance of the detector resistor taking place during
said short pulse and wherein the detector further comprises a reference resistor.Further, the invention concerns a method based on a detector for detecting the presence of
water, in particular of dew and/or of ice, and/or for detecting a change of phase in water
which detector comprises a substrate onto whose face at least one resistor pattern is applied,
and in which detector for detecting the presence of water on the basis of a change in resistance
of a detector resistor, a low-mass detector resistor pattern is applied onto the substrate out of a
material having a characteristic substantially dependent on temperature on said substrate, said
detector comprising the detector resistor and a reference resistor having substantially the same
value of resistance and being placed at different branches of a bridge connection and said
resistors being made of same material on said substrate by thin film technique and the area of
the reference resistor being substantially larger than the area of the detector resistor.In particular, the invention concerns a detector and a method intended for detecting the
presence of water and in particular of dew. Detectors for the presence of a liquid, in particular
of water dew, are needed, for example, in various electronic apparatuses, in automobile
windshields, in various measurement apparatuses, such as hygrometers. As is known from the
prior art, a dew-point detector has also been used for measurement of relative humidity by
detecting the temperature at which dew starts condensing on the face of the detector.As is known from the prior art, the detectors used for detection of dew have been based on a
change in the reflectivity of the active face of the detector, on measurement of the changes in
the dielectric or electric properties of a hygroscopic material, or on measurement of the mass
of the condensed water. Some examples of the prior art related to the present invention are the
applicant's FI Patents Nos.
