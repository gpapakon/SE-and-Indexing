<ABSTRACT>
A process and device for converting chemical energy from a fuel into thermal and at the same time directly into electrical energy, in which the primary fuel flow (1) is divided into at least two parallel and separately regulated (4; 5) partial flows (2; 3) taken to a fuel cell (6) and a burner (7) and the oxygen vehicle flow (8) is regulated either in its entirety or in partial flows (12; 13) in such a way that the electrical and thermal energy flows are fully decoupled. The partial flow (12) of the oxygen vehicle intended for the high-temperature fuel cell (6) is preheated (14) by the entire exhaust gas current (25). The latter's thermal energy is used to prepare the primary fuel by evaporation (27) and conversion (26) and to provide useful heat (18; 19). A compact, integrated construction with a container (20) containing the fuel cell (6), the burner (7), the after-burner (28) and the converter (26) in the central section and the heat exchanger, lines, controls and accessories in the peripheral section.

A process for the conversion of chemical energy of a liquid and/or 
gaseous fuel into heat energy for the purposes of applying heat in 

households or industry, for chemical and metallurgical reactions of all 
kinds by means of a burner and at the same time directly into electrical 

energy by means of a fuel cell, in such a way that only a part of the 
chemically bound energy of the primary fuel is converted into heat but the 

remainder is at the same time directly converted into electrical energy, 
characterised in that the primary fuel flow (1) which is delivered under an 

increased pressure is divided into at least two partial flows (2; 3) which 
are disposed in parallel, wherein at least one respective partial flow is 

separately controlled/regulated (4; 5) and fed separately to the fuel cell 
(6) on the one hand and the burner (7) on the other hand in such a way as 

to provide for complete decoupling of the electrical energy flow from the 
heat energy flow in any percentage relationship in accordance with the 

respective requirement in terms of location and time, and that the flow 
(12) of the oxygen carrier for feeding the fuel cell (6) is preheated in 

counter-flow relationship by the common exhaust gases (25) of the fuel cell 
(6) and the burner (7), that in addition the heat energy of said exhaust 

gases is utilised by very substantially giving off their sensible heat on the 
one hand to the part of the primary fuel intended for the burner (7), for 

preparation thereof such as vaporisation (27), conversion (26) into 
suitable gases and execution of the water gas reaction, and on the other 

hand primarily to a gaseous or liquid heat carrier (19), that further a 
part of the latent heat of the exhaust gases is used by condensation (24) 

of at least a part oftheirwater vapour content for a first preheating of 
the oxygen carrier (8), and that the oxygen carrier flow (8) is selectively 

divided into controllable/regulatable partial flows (12; 13) or is passed 
as a whole in the process, and that for thermodynamic reasons the fuel cell 

(6) used is a ceramic high-temperature solid-electrolyte cell which is at 
least in respect of a part heated and maintained at the necessary operating 

temperature by direct heat transfer from hot burner exhaust gases (17) by 
means of convection, heat conduction and radiation.  

 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the oxygen 
carrier flow (8) is firstly pre-compressad (9), divided into at least one 

respective partial flow (13) for the burner (7) and a partial flow (12) 
which is in parallel therewith for the fuel cell (6) and each partial flow 

(12; 13) is separately controlled/regulated (10; 11) in such a way that the 
amount of oxygen fed to each associated partial flow (2; 3) of the primary 

fuel is that which is required for completely independent conversion into 
electrical and heat energy in accordance with the decoupling according to 

the need involved. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the part of 
the oxygen carrier flow (8) which is intended for the burner (7) is 

branched off without pre-compressing, utilising the natural suction draft 
of an atmospheric burner (7), and only the part (12) which is intended for 

the fuel cell (6) is pre-compressed, separately controlled/regulated (10) 
and fed to the latter. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the oxygen 
carrier flow (8) is firstly as a whole compressed (9), controlled/regulated 

(10), fed to the fuel cell (6), there suitably further heated and passed as 

a residual flow in the form of the partial exhaust gas flow (15) of the 
oxygen electrode chamber to the burner (7) which is connected in series 

downstream of the fuel cell. 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the partial 
flow (2) of the primary fuel flow (1), which is fed to the fuel cell (6), 

is controlled/regulated in respect of composition and amount by the member 
(4) disposed upstream of the fuel cell (6), in such a way that, after 

flowing through the fuel cell (6), a component which can still be oxidised 
remains, and that the corresponding partial exhaust gas flow (16) of the 

fuel electrode chamber is fed to the burner (7) as an additional residual 
fuel.  

 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that to start the 
fuel cell (6) operating firstly its partial flow (2) of the primary fuel is 

completely switched off (4) and the fuel cell (6), while avoiding the 
supply of electrical energy, is brought up to operating temperature only in 

respect of a part by direct heat transfer from hot burner exhaust gases 
(17) by means of convection, heat conduction and radiation, and in respect 

of the other part by its partial flow (12) of the oxygen carrier, which is 
indirectly heated up by the burner exhaust gases (17).

the same time directly into electrical energy according to claim 1 wherein
