<ABSTRACT>
A first substrate (2) carries an array (3) of imaging elements 
(4). An array (5) of lens elements (6) is provided with each lens 

element (6) associated with at least one imaging element (4) for 
concentrating light (L) travelling on a light path between the 

imaging element (4) and the at least one lens element (6). An 
electro-optic material (8) having an electrically alterable 

refractive index is provided in a space defined between a second 

substrate (7) and one of the imaging element and the lens element 
arrays (3 and 5). Electrodes (8a,8b) are provided for applying an 

electrical potential across the electro-optic material (8) to 
adjust the effective focal length of the lens elements (6). The 

focal length of the lens elements (6) can thus be adjusted by 
applying or varying the potential applied across the electro-optic 

material so that the focus of the imaging device is not entirely 
dependent on the nature and construction of the lens elements (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an imaging device. EP-A-0 154962 describes an imaging device in the form of an 
image sensor comprising a first substrate carrying an array of 
photosensitive elements. In the image sensor described in 
EP-A-0 154962, each photosensitive element is associated with a 
respective lens element for focussing light incident on the lens 
element onto the associated photosensitive element. As described 
in EP-A-0 154962, the photosensitive elements are formed by thin-film 
technology on one surface of an insulating substrate and the lens 
elements are formed on the other surface of the same substrate by, 
for example, locally altering the refractive index of the 
substrate. In such a case, the focal length of the image sensor is 
of course determined by the construction of the lenses and in 
practice will be limited by the technology used to form the lens. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an imaging 
device for which the focal length is not completely dependent upon 
the construction of the lenses and which may allow for adjustment 
of the focal length. According to the present invention, there is provided an 
imaging device comprising a first substrate carrying an array of 
imaging elements and an array of lens elements with each lens 
element being associated with at least one imaging element for 
concentrating light travelling on a light path between the imaging 
element and the at least one lens element, characterised in that an 
electro-optic material having an electrically alterable refractive 
index is provided in the path of the light in a space defined between a second substrate and 
one of the imaging element and the lens element arrays and in that 
means are provided for applying an electrical potential across the 
electro-optic material to adjust the effective focal length of the 
lens elements.  
 Thus, in an imaging device in accordance with the invention, 
the focal length of the lenses can be adjusted by applying or 
varying a potential applied across the electro-optic material so 
that the focal length is not entirely dependent on the nature and 
construction of the lens elements. In one example the lens element array is carried by the second 
substrate and the space for the electro-optic material is provided 
between the imaging element array and the second substrate. In another example the space for the electro-optic material is 
provided between the lens element array and the second substrate. The means for applying an electrical potential across
