<ABSTRACT>
Methods for extracting nucleic acids by heating sample 
cells, e.g. bacterial cells, at about 80-100°C in the 

presence of a permeabilization reagent comprising a non-ionic 
detergent and a metal chelating agent are described. 

The methods of the invention release large fragments of 
undegraded nucleic acids from microorganisms without 

physically disrupting the entire cell wall. Clinical 
samples may be screened for the presence or absence of a 

microorganism by employing an extraction method of the 
invention and subsequently adding a nucleic acid probe 

specific for a nucleic acid of the selected microorganism, 
incubating under conditions which allow the probe to 

hybridize to said nucleic acid and detecting whether any 
hybridised probe is present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for extracting,
and determining the presence of, nucleic acids of a wide range
of organisms in samples, particularly for example clinical
specimens. The extracted nucleic acid is suitable for use in
nucleic acid hybridization procedures and other diagnostic
techniques for specifically identifying tested organisms. For
this purpose, diagnostic kits are disclosed employing
permeablization reagents suitable for extracting nucleic acids
from a wide range of organisms, such nucleic acids being suitable
for subsequent hybridization, detection, and quantitative
identification of the assayed organisms.The advent of modern techniques of molecular biology and
genetic engineering has caused a revolution in the diagnosis of
disease. In recent years the identification of pathogenic
organisms, especially microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast, 
has become much faster and more accurate as increasingly advanced
methods for detecting, quantifying, and distinguishing between
species and subspecies of microorganisms have been developed.
Many, if not most, of these diagnostic techniques exploit
inherent differences between the nucleic acid sequences of
different species of pathogenic agents, and between pathogenic
and non-pathogenic microorganisms. The speed, selectivity and
sensitivity of these nucleic acid-based diagnostic methods has
resulted in faster and more accurate patient treatment, and hence
a more healthy public.Diagnostic kits relying primarily on nucleic acid
hybridization have been developed for the diagnosis of a number
of diseases in which microscopic organisms are implicated, either
as a causative agent or as an indicator of the disease. While not
intended to be an exhaustive listing, kits are thus available or
contemplated for the detection and/or the identification of the
microorganisms responsible for tuberculosis (Mycobacterium
tuberculosis), common sexually transmitted diseases (Chlamydia
trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae), respiratory illnesses
(Mycoplasma pneumoniae), pharyngitis and rheumatic fever (Group
A Streptococcus (S. pyogenes)), epiglottitis (Haemophilus
influenzae) as well as viruses such as the causative agent of ARC
and AIDS (HIV). All such methods require the target nucleic
acids to be readily available for hybridization. Most methods for extracting microbial nucleic acids involve
bursting the microorganism's cell wall (lysis) and extracting the
contents of the cell into a buffered solution. Lipids,
carbohydrates, and proteins can then be
