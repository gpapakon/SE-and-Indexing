<ABSTRACT>
A data bus coupler includes a plated composite housing and a plurality of twin 
axial contacts, the shielding portions of each contact being connected to the housing 

by a conductive insert which serves to retain the contacts in the connector. The 
coupler also includes a printed circuit board carrying transformers and isolation 

resistors for providing stub connections to a data bus line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors, and more particularly to a 
shielded electrical connector including data bus coupling circuitry. A data bus coupler is an electrical connector which permits splitting of data 
signals without attenuation of the signal strength. The data bus typically includes a 
single, twisted, pair of wires and a cable shield which protects transmitted data from 
magnetic and electrostatic interference. The coupler typically includes a bus line 
which connects an input contact to an output contact, and a number of branch or stub 
contacts tapped into the bus line via transformers. The resulting multiplexed data bus 
coupler enables the use of smaller and lighter twinaxial cables instead of complicated,  
 
heavy and dedicated cabling. Desirable qualities in a data bus coupler are that the 
coupler be compact, lightweight, electromagnetically sealed, and able to withstand 
severe environmental conditions. One such data bus coupler is disclosed in Patent No. 4,720,155. The coupler 
of Patent No. 4,720,155 includes a metallic shell, an apertured ground plate to 
connect the shields of the contacts to the shell, a dielectric contact retention member, 
and a circuit board which carries a transformer and isolation resistors. The ground 
plate fits between the main housing and a rear can enclosure which encloses the 
circuit board. The coupler disclosed in Patent No. 4,720,155 provides a compact and 
effectively shielded structure. However, for many applications, it would be desirable 
to reduce even further the weight, number of parts, and size of such a coupler, 
without reducing its shielding effectiveness. It is an objective of the invention to reduce the weight without reducing the 
strength of prior electrical connectors by providing a housing made of a metal-plated 
non-metallic composite substrate. It is also an objective of the invention to accomplish the above objective by 
providing a lightweight, high strength data bus coupler having a housing and rear can 
enclosure both made of a metal-plated non-metallic composite substrate.  It is a further objective of the invention to provide a less complex shielded 
electrical connector in which a ground plane and dielectric contact retention member 
are replaced by a conductive insert assembly which serves as both a contact retention 
member and as a ground path between the housing and the contacts. It is a still further objective of the invention to provide an electrical connector 
which includes a circuit board on which
