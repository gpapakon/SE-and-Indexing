<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a catalytic reactor into which liquid media can be continuously introduced, evaporated and supplied to catalytic reactions, the reactor space being formed by a tubular reactor shell open at one end, which reactor shell can be closed by a reactor cover having a throat opening, and a tube acting as an evaporator stage being arranged from the region of the throat opening to deep in the reactor space, which tube is furnished with an impingement baffle and an impingement baffle holder at the end extending into the reactor space and the remaining reactor space being at least partially filled with catalyst, forming a catalyst stage. In order to make such a catalytic reactor thermally stable and stress-free in all zones, and, overall, simple to manufacture, according to the invention, it is proposed that the tube (5), the impingement baffle (6) and the impingement baffle holder (7) are composed of ceramic material and that the tube (5) and the impingement baffle holder (7) are formed in one piece.

A catalytic reactor in which liquid media can be 
continuously introduced, evaporated and sent to 

catalytic reactions, wherein the reactor space is 
formed by a tubular reactor casing (1) open on one side 

which can be closed by a reactor cover (11) having a 
passage opening, and a pipe (5) which acts as an 

evaporator stage being provided extending from the 
region of the passage opening (4) to deep into the 

reactor space (2), which pipe at the end extending into 
the reactor space (2) is provided with a baffle plate 

(6) and a baffle-plate holding device (7) and the 
remaining reactor space (2) is at least partly filled 

with catalyst (8), forming a catalyst stage,
 
characterised in that
 
the pipe (5), the baffle plate (6) and the baffle-plate 

holding device (7) are made of ceramic material, and 
that the pipe (5) and the baffle-plate holding device 

(7) are made integral. 
A catalytic reactor according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that a cup-shaped element (9) is 

arranged on the base of the reactor, into which element 
the pipe (5) projects in the region of the baffle-plate 

holding device (7) and which is covered by a perforated 
plate (10). 
A catalytic reactor according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that the cup-shaped element (9) and 

the perforated plate (10) are made of ceramic material. 
A catalytic reactor according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the reactor 

cover (11) is made of glass.  
 
A catalytic reactor according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that the pipe 

(5) is fixed in the reactor beneath the reactor cover 
(11) via a partially positively insertable holding ring 

(3) after closure of the reactor with the reactor cover 
(11). 
A catalytic reactor according to Claim 5, 
characterised in that the holding ring (3) is 

constructed such that it can be inserted into a 
circumambient step (13) at the open end of the reactor 

casing (1) and the pipe (5) is fixed centrally, 
relative to the reactor cross-section. 
A catalytic reactor according to Claim 6, 
characterised in that the holding ring (3) is designed 

as an intermediate cover insertable beneath the reactor 
cover (11), which in the region between the pipe (5) 

which is fixed in the mounted state and the reactor 
casing (1) has through openings (12) through which the 

reactor can be filled with catalyst (8) before the 
reactor cover (11) is placed on. 
A catalytic reactor according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterised in that a resistive 

heating means (14) is provided on the baffle-plate 
hol
ding device (7), and the associated electric lines 
are passed out of the reactor in the region of the pipe 

(5). 
A catalytic reactor according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that the heating means (14) is 

arranged in a support (15) which is annular and can be 
connected to the baffle-plate holding device (7), 

surrounding it in annular manner.  
 
A catalytic reactor according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that a temperature sensor (16) is 

arranged between the baffle-plate holding device (7) 
and support (15).
