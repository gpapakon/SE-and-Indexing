<ABSTRACT>
In an injection molding machine which comprises a 
mold composed of a fixed mold attached to a fixed platen 

and a movable mold attached to a movable platen, and a 
driving source for driving the movable platen to open and 

close the mold, a distance sensor detects, as a platen 
interval, a distance between two positions preliminarily 

selected on the fixed platen and the movable platen and 
produces a distance detection signal. A pressure sensor 

detects a clamping pressure applied by the driving source 
and produces a pressure detection signal. A control unit 

controls the driving source to adjust the platen interval 
and the clamping pressure through a plurality of steps in 

response to the distance detection signal and the 
pressure detection signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an injection molding
machine adapted to molding of a resin material and, in
particular, to a control system capable of improving the
facility of operation executed by an operator.Generally, injection molding of a resin product
is carried out through a molding cycle comprising a resin
melting process, a filling process, a holding process,
and a cooling process. In order to obtain a molded
product having an excellent quality, it is a common
practice to control a temperature of a mold comprising a
fixed mold and a movable mold, a temperature of a resin
material within the mold, an injection pressure, and the
like. In addition to such control, it is also important
to control a clamping pressure applied to the mold and a
mold opening which is a distance between opposite
surfaces of the fixed mold and the movable mold. These
opposite surfaces are called parting surfaces.
Furthermore, it is important to determine a timing of
switching from the filling process to the holding
process, namely, V-P (velocity-pressure) switching.
Thus, control of various factors is required to obtain a 
molded product having an excellent quality.By way of example, description will be given as
regards control of the clamping pressure. The clamping
pressure is defined by a clamping force F which is
calculated in accordance with the following equation:
F = AÂ·P/1000,
where A represents a pressure receiving area (cm2) of the
molded product while P represents an average internal
pressure (kg/cm2) of the mold. In a conventional control
system, the clamping pressure is held constant at a
preselected clamping pressure throughout an injection
process, including the filling process and the holding
process, and the cooling process. In such a control
system, however, various defects such as short shot, a
weld mark or line, and burning are often caused to occur
when the preselected clamping pressure is relatively
high. Under the clamping pressure which is relatively
high, air initially present in the mold when the mold is
being filled with the melted resin and gas produced from
the melted resin are not discharged from the mold at the
end of the injection process. Such air and gas are
compressed and remain in the mold. Under the
circumstances, an operator decreases the preselected
clamping pressure in order to expedite discharge of the
air and the gas present within the mold. However, when
the preselected clamping pressure is excessively
decreased, there arises another problem of occurrence of
flash. Thus, the operator
