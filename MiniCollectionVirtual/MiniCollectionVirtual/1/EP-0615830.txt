<ABSTRACT>
The process relates to the production of extruded foamed plastics, a foaming agent being fed under high pressure to the plastic conveyed in the extruder and the amount of foaming agent being controlled by a servo-valve. If there are fluctuations in the pressure of the polymer melt, the amount of fed foaming agent must be controlled correspondingly by the servo-valve (4). The regulating capabilities of customary servo-valves are often inadequate for this. Therefore, it is proposed to keep the pressure constant behind the servo-valve by means of a pressure-maintaining valve (5) and to control the amount of foaming agent directly as a function of the conveyed polymer melt, preferably via the extruder speed.

Process for the production of extruded foamed 
plastics, a foaming agent being fed under high pressure 

to the plastic conveyed in the extruder and the amount 
of foaming agent being controlled by a servo-valve (4), 

and the pressure behind the servo-valve being kept 
constant by means of a pressure-maintaining valve (5), 

characterized in that the amount of foaming agent is 
controlled directly as a function of the conveyed 

polymer mass and in that the differential pressure 
between the inlet and outlet of the servo-valve (4) is 

kept constant to within 10 to 50 bar, preferably 10 to 
30 bar. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the amount of foaming agent flowing through the 

servo-valve (4) is controlled via the extruder speed. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that nitrogen or carbon dioxide is 

used as the foaming agent. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that a further foaming agent, preferably a hydrocarbon 

or halogenated hydrocarbon, is fed to the nitrogen or 
carbon dioxide in a mixing chamber.
