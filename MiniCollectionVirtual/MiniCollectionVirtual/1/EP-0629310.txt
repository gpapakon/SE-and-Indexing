Safety device protecting a nuclear reactor 
pressure vessel against overpressure failure in the event 

of inadequate cooling of the core, wherein there is 
pressure-tightly inserted into a wall (1) of the pressure 

vessel (11), or into a line (2) passing through said wall 
(1), a pressure relief valve (4) which by means of a 

closure element (8) normally blocks the flow from the 
interior of the pressure vessel (11) to a pressure relief 

line (10) and which is held by a valve closing spring 
(12) supported against an abutment (14), characterized in 

that the abutment (14) is in turn held by a force transmission 
element (13), and in that said force transmission 

element (13) is fastened at its end remote from the 
abutment (14) by means of a detent (16; 35) which is 

arranged in the pressure vessel (11) and is releasable in 
dependence on a threshold temperature and which is 

releasable, for the purpose of freeing the abutment (14) 
and th
us lifting the closure element (8) off its seat as 
the result of differential pressure, at a threshold 

temperature of for example 700Â° C. 
Safety device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the force transmission element (13) extends from 

its force application point on the abutment (14) into the 
interior of the pressure vessel (11) as far as a built-in 

element (15), where it is fastened by means of the 
temperature-dependent detent (16; 35). 
Safety device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the force transmission element (13) 

is in the form of a tension element which at its one end 
(13.1) is coupled to the closure element (8) by means of  

 
the abutment (14) of the valve closing spring (12), and 

at its other end (13.2) is fastened by means of the 
temperature-dependent detent (16; 35) which, when the 

threshold temperature is reached, permits axial deflection 
of the tension element (13). 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the force transmission element (13) 

is fastened by means of a fusible solder detent (16) 
which melts when the threshold temperature is reached. 
Safety device according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the tension element (13) is joined tensionally 

fast at its other end to a metal bar (35) fastened to and 
in thermal contact with built-in elements of the pressure 

vessel, and is secured by means of this metal bar, the 
coefficient of linear expansion of the metal bar (35) 

being higher, preferably substantially higher, than that 
of the tension element (13), and the metal bar and, with 

it, the tension element (13) undergoing, when the threshold 
temperature is reached, an elongation such that the 

closure element (8) opens. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the pressure relief valve (4) is 

flanged on a connection neck (2) on the lid of the 
pressure vessel (11). 
Safety device according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the tension element (13) is in the 

form of a draw rod. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the force transmission element (13) 

is provided, inside the pressure vessel (11), with a 
releasable coupling (19, 21; 39) permitting the 

uncoupling and withdrawal of at least a part of the force 
transmission element (13) before the dismantling of the 

pressure vessel lid (1). 
Safety device according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the force transmission element (13), together 

with its temperature-dependent detent, is capable of 
being fastened to an upper grid plate (15) of the  

 
pressure vessel (11) and, by means of a releasable 

coupling or locking means, for example a bayonet fastening 
(19a, 22, 23), of being released and dismantled from 

above, at least as regards an outer or upper part, when 
the pressure relief valve (4) is open. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the closure element (8) of the 

pressure relief valve (4) is a valve cone which tapers 
towards the flow arrival direction and which is held 

sealingly by the force transmission element (13) against 
correspondingly conical seat surfaces (17) and against 

the action of the force resulting from the differential 
pressure. 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that a valve stem (8a) of the closure 

element (8) is sealingly and slidingly guided in a 
stuffing box (26), in that an overflow chamber (9) 

communicating with the pressure relief line (10) and 
delimiting the valve seat is situated on that side of the 

stuffing box (26) which faces the pressure vessel (11), 
and in that the valve closing spring (12) is housed in a 

valve chamber (28) on the other side of the stuffing box 
(26). 
Safety device according to Claim 11, characterized 
in that the force transmission element (13) extends, 

sliding centrally, through the valve stem (8a), which 
projects into the valve chamber (28), in that on the side 

of the stuffing box (26) remote from the closure element 
(8) the valve stem (8a) widens into a pressure-tight 

capsule delimiting the valve chamber (28), or is joined 
to such a capsule (29), and in that the valve closing 

spring (12) is contained in the capsule (29) and is 
supported at one end on the bottom of the capsule (29.1), 

while at the other end it is supported against the 
abutment (14) formed or carried by the free end (13.1) of 

the force transmission element (13). 
Safety device according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that, given correspondingly smaller  

 
cross-sectional dimensions of the pressure relief valve 

(4) and of the connection neck (2) on the lid, the 
pressure relief line (10) is in the form of a control 

line for a separate blow-off valve. 
Safety device according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the releasable coupling is a screw 

thread coupling (39).
