<ABSTRACT>
A system for detecting motion in a video image is 
provided wherein the video image is processed into a 

statistical array in which the array elements are derived 
from overlapping portions of the image. The elements of 

the statistical array are compared with corresponding 
array elements derived from an earlier image. The 

overlapping nature of the statistical array elements 
allows any detected changes in the image to be correlated 

with a portion of the image that is smaller than the area 
from which the statistical quantities are derived. Such 

spatial correlation of detected image changes is 
accomplished by thresholding and/or Boolean comparisons 

among the elements of the statistical array. A motion 
detection system in accordance with this invention can be 

used with a video multiplexing system so that motion cay 
be detected at a plurality of remote locations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
detecting movement between successive video images. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a system 
for providing improved spatial resolution of motion 
detection while also providing reduced sensitivity to 
minor variations in successive images. Video motion detection systems are known in which 
a comparison is made between a live video image and a 
stored representation of an earlier video image in 
order to detect relative motion between the two 
signals on the basis of a difference between the live 
and stored images. In order to reduce the information 
storage and processing overhead needed to compare 
video images, and to reduce sensitivity to relatively 
minor fluctuations between images, a live video signal 
can be analyzed to produce a first statistical 
quantity that is then compared to a second statistical 
quantity that is representative of a previous video 
signal. U.S. Patent No. 4,894,716, assigned to Burle 
Technologies, Inc., the assignee of the present 
application, describes a motion detection system 
wherein the positions of edges of objects within a 
live video image are compared with stored data 
relative to edge positions within the image at an 
earlier time. In that motion detection system, 
sensitivity to minor changes is reduced by detecting 
changes over several adjacent horizontal portions of 
an image before an alarm is activated. In general, 
increasing the size of portions of the image from 
which image statistics are extracted and compared 
reduces sensitivity to minor or spurious image 
changes.  In addition to detecting whether motion has 
occurred, it would be desirable for a video motion 
detection system to determine the location or 
locations within the video image where motion is 
detected. Such capability could be used, for example, 
to produce an alarm in response to detecting motion 
within a selected portion or portions of the image 
while ignoring motion within other non-selected 
portions of the image. It would further be desirable 
to provide such a motion detection system in which the 
spatial resolution is high enough to allow precise 
definition of the selected area or areas that are 
analyzed for motion and the selected area or areas 
that are to be ignored. However, improvement of the 
spatial resolution of motion detection has heretofore 
been in conflict with the extraction of sufficient 
relevant statistical quantities from a relatively 
large portion of the image in order to reduce 
sensitivity
