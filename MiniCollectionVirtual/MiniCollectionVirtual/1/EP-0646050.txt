<ABSTRACT>
A method for the removal of debris and other unwanted matter from the bore of a blind tubular line (38) including measuring the length of the bore once it has been cleared. The cleaning and measurement method includes inserting an elongate tube (12) into the bore of the line (38), injecting (12, 14) a compressed gas through the elongate tube (38) and extracting by suction (32) from the end of the line at which the tube enters debris and other unwanted matter from the gap between the tube and the inner wall of the line, attaching a flexible elongate member to a camera insertible in the said bore in such a manner that an end portion of the said member is detected by the said camera when the camera is moved along the said bore, moving the camera and the said member attached thereto along the said bore until the said member is detected by the camera to reach the blind end of the tubular bore, and measuring the length of the said elongate member which has been fed into the tubular line to reach the said blind end.

<DESCRIPTION>
Line Cleaning System and MeasurementThis invention relates to a line cleaning and measurement system, and more particularly to a system for the cleaning and measurement of instrument lines, ie tubular lines having an internal bore through which an instrument may be inserted.During the construction and commissioning of chemical plants it is necessary to inspect the bores of a large number of instrument lines prior to the insertion of instrument probes. The inspection often reveals that such lines contain debris such as water, cleaning solvents, swarf, grinding and other construction debris. The instrument lines are usually 'blind', being completely closed at one end, and often terminate in a reduced diameter instrument pocket into which the instrument probe locates. Most of these instrument pockets are located inside closed vessels, some of which are up to 25m below the top of the line. The instrument lines will often be curved in order to position the instrument probe at the desired location. Since the lines are of a small diameter, typically 20mm, removal of the debris is both expensive and time consuming when conventional means are used.Cutting of the instrument lines allows them to be partially cleaned by conventional means. However, this does not solve the problem of debris in the bottom part of the line, ie that part which is inside the closed vessel.A problem caused by the presence of debris in instrument lines is the mislocation of instrument probes during their insertion. A conventional method of locating probes is to feed a probe down an instrument line until it can go no further. In situations where debris is present in the line the probe may stop short of the instrument pocket and thereby, upon plant start up, provide information to the plant operators from the wrong location, with potentially disastrous consequences. 

 A method for cleaning the inner surface of a heat exchanger tube is described in British Patent Specification No. 1,103,488 in which a pressurised fluid, supplied from a tube located within the heat exchanger tube, is deflected against the inner surface of the heat exchanger tube in a direction concurrent with the flow of fluid through the heat exchanger tube so as to carry away material removed from the inner surface. Such a system, however, is incapable of clearing curved lines.European Patent Application No. 0 029 980 discloses an apparatus for clearing debris from a drilled cavity by blowing pressurised gas into the cavity and removing the ejected debris by suction.

Claims
1. A method for the removal of debris and other unwanted matter from the bore of a blind tubular line to be cleaned, the method including inserting an elongate tube into the bore of the line, injecting a compressed gas through the elongate tube and extracting by suction from the end of the line at which the tube enters the line debris and other unwanted matter from the gap between the tube and the inner wall of the line.
2. A method as in Claim 1 and wherein the tube is inserted into the line through an applicator having an attachment which is attached to a corresponding attachment on an end of the line, the applicator also having an outlet through which said debris and other unwanted matter is extracted.
3. A method as in Claim 1 or Claim 2 and wherein a source of compressed gas is connected to the free end of the tube, the source being switchable whereby gas may be injected when required by an operator.
4. A method as in Claim 2 and wherein a suction pump is connected to the outlet of the applicator, the suction pump being switchable whereby debris and other matter may be extracted when required by an operator.
5. A method as in any one of the preceding Claims and wherein the said line is an instrument line.
6. A method as in Claim 5 and wherein the line is a thermocouple line.
7. A method as in Claim 5 or Claim 6 and wherein the thermocouple line terminates in an thermocouple pocket having a reduced average diameter.
8. A method as in Claim 7 and wherein the tube terminates in a reduced average diameter portion having an external diameter less than the internal diameter of the thermocouple pocket, the reduced diameter portion of the tube being insertable into the thermocouple pocket. 


9. A method as in Claim 2 and wherein the tube is slidably located within the line by means of a resilient packing member contained within the applicator.
10. A method as in any one of the preceding Claims the method including manipulating the tube within the line so as to dislodge the debris and other matter into the gap between the tube and the line in order that the debris and other matter may be removed by suction.
11. A method as in any one of the preceding Claims and wherein the compressed gas pressure is less than or equal to 150 psi (1.03 x 10
6
 Nm~
2
).
12. A method as in any one of the preceding Claims, the method including the steps of attaching the applicator to the tubular line, inserting the elongate tube into the bore of the line, passing compressed gas down the tube so as to dislodge the debris and other unwanted matter inside the bore of the line, activating the suction pump connected to the outlet of the applicator, manipulating the tube within the bore of the line so as to direct the debris and other matter into the gap between the tube and the bore of the line so that the debris and other matter becomes carried by the suction-assisted gas flow, and removing the debris and other matter through the outlet of the applicator by suction.
13. A method of measuring the length of the bore of a blind tubular line which includes the steps of removing debris from the line in accordance with the method of any one of the preceding Claims, attaching a flexible elongate member to a camera insertible in the said bore in such a manner that an end portion of the said member can be detected by the said camera when the camera is moved along the said bore, moving the camera and the said member attached thereto along the said bore until the said member is detected by the camera to reach the blind end of the tubular bore, and measuring the length of the said elongate 


member which has been fed into the tubular line to reach the said blind end.
14. A method as in Claim 13 and wherein the camera is a closed circuit tv camera which is attached via one or more suitable cables to an image processing unit and video display unit outside the said line so that a remote operator can observe the image detected inside the bore.
15. A method as in Claim 13 or Claim 14 and wherein the said camera has an associated actuator device, eg including one or more stepper motors, which is controlled remotely and which provides movement of the camera along the bore.
16. A method as in Claim 13 and wherein the said elongate member comprises wire, cable, tape, fibre or the like.
17. A method as in any one of Claims 13 to 16 and wherein the said elongate member is attached to the camera by means of the said cable or cables.
18. A method as in any one of Claims 13 to 17 and wherein the said end portion of the elongate member protrudes beyond the camera viewing head to facilitate detection by the camera.
19. A method for the removal of debris and other unwanted matter from the bore of a tubular line substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to Figures 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawing.
