<ABSTRACT>
Using an endoscope system, a surgeon (A) holds an endoscope 
(2) with a TV camera (hereinafter, an endoscope) and a 

therapeutic appliance such as forceps and carries out a 
surgical procedure while viewing a first monitor (4). A 

surgeon (B) holds a therapeutic appliance such as forceps 
and carries out the surgical procedure while viewing a 

second monitor (7). A video signal sent from the TV camera 
of the endoscope (2) is fed to and processed by an image 

processing apparatus (8), and displayed on each of the 
first and second monitors (4 and 7). The image processing 

apparatus (8) supplies the video signal sent from the 
endoscope to each of an image inverting circuit (11) and 

selector switches (12 and 13). The image inverting circuit 
(11) inverts an image (laterally (to produce a mirror 

image), vertically, or vertically and laterally (180Â°)), 
and supplies a processed video signal to each of the 

selector switches (12 and 13). Each of the selector 
switches (12 and 13) selects a video signal to be supplied 

to each of the first and second monitors (4 and 7), which 
are display units, in response to a control signal sent 

from a selector (14). The contents of processing to be 
performed by the image inverting circuit (11) and the video 

signal to be selected by the selector (14) are designated 
using setting switches on an operation panel (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image processing
apparatus for performing image processing on an input video
signal.Conventionally, when the inferior cholecyst is
enucleated under laparoscopic observation or any other
surgical procedure is conducted under endoscopic
observation, the lesion is treated using a therapeutic
appliance with the help of endoscopic images of the lesion
appearing on a TV monitor.However, it is impossible to grasp the movement or
position of forceps or the like in a region outside a field
of view which cannot be covered by an endoscope. A
positional relationship of a therapeutic appliance with a
lesion cannot therefore be understood, thus hindering
efficient proceeding of surgery.During an endoscope-aided surgical procedure, a surgeon
and an assistant stand with an operation table between them. 
The surgeon and assistant carries out the procedure while
viewing monitors located on the opposite sides of them.However, as long as the surgeon (assistant) facing an
endoscope is concerned, his/her right and left hands are
inverse to the right and left hands of an endoscopic image.
The surgeon (assistant) has therefore difficulty in
conducting the procedure.As shown in Fig. 75, a surgeon A and a surgeon B are
opposed to each other with a patient between them. The
surgeon A inserts therapeutic appliances 502 and 503 as well
as an endoscope 501 with a TV camera (hereinafter, referred
to merely as an endoscope) using a trocar and cannula.
Assuming that a lesion 506 in a body cavity has the
positional relationships as shown in Fig. 76 with the
endoscope 501 as well as the therapeutic appliances 502,
503, 504, and 505, an image produced by the endoscope 501
appears as shown in Fig. 77 on a monitor.When the surgeon B tries to move the therapeutic
appliance 505 in a direction indicated with a dotted line in
a screen on the monitor shown in Fig. 77 in an attempt to
bring the therapeutic appliance 505 close to the lesion, if
the surgeon B operates the therapeutic appliance 505 while
viewing the monitor, the therapeutic appliance 505 actually
moves in a direction indicated with a solid line. The same
applies to the therapeutic appliance 504. That is to say,
the surgeon B finds positional relationships in the screen 
on the monitor laterally inverse to the actual ones.For the surgeon B, an image made by laterally inverting
the image on the monitor shown in Fig. 77 (hereinafter,
referred to as a mirror image) looks natural and helpful in
manipulating therapeutic appliances.Likewise, in the
