<ABSTRACT>
The pharmaceutical preparation in the form of an effervescent and/or disintegrating tablet or an instant granulate contains at least one taste irritating agent and at least one matrix delaying the release of the agent which is intimately mixed with the agent particles or envelops them and is applied to a substrate. The preparation in aqueous solution at room temperature releases at most 65 and preferably at most 50 % of the agent within some 2 minutes, but in 0.1n HCl at 38  DEG C releases over 70 and preferably 80 % of the agent within at most 20 and preferably at most 15 minutes The matrix preferably contains at least one fatty acid ester and/or a wax, preferably with a melting point between 30 and 45, especially between 32 and 35  DEG C, and/or at least one cellulose derivative and/or at least one polymethacrylate acid ester. The quantity of the agent is under 60 and preferably under 10 mg, that of the matrix 1 to 10, preferably 3 to 5 times that of the agent per tablet or dose of granulate. For the treatment of diarrhoea by means of loperamide, the matrix also contains a mixture and quantity of alkaline and/or alkaline earth salts, preferably organic salts, and chlorides which compensate for the loss of electrolyte in the body.

Claims for the following Contracting States : AT, BE, CH, LI, DE, 
DK, FR, GB, GR, IE, IT, NL, PT, SE
Pharmaceutical formulation in the form of an 
effervescent and/or disintegrating tablet or of instant 

granules, containing at least one active ingredient 
having an irritating taste and at least one matrix 

which delays the release of the active ingredient, 
characterised in that the matrix is present as an 

intimate mixture with the active ingredient particles 
or covers said particles and is applied to a carrier, 

the formulation releasing at most 65%, preferably at 
most 50%, of the active ingredient in aqueous solution 

at room temperature within about 2 min but more than 
70%, preferably at least 80%, of the active ingredient 

within max. 20 min, preferably max. 15 min, in 0.1 N 
HCl at 38°C. 
Formulation according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the matrix contains at least one fatty ester 

and/or one wax, preferably having a melting point 
between 30 and 45°C, in particular between 32 and 35°C. 
Formulation according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the matrix contains at least one 

cellulose derivative, preferably hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 
phthalate (HPMCP), cellulose acetate 

phthalate (CAP), cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT) 
or cellulose acetobutyrate (CAB). 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the carrier comprises at 

least one of the substances mannitol, sorbitol, 
sucrose, lactose, Aerosil, starch and 

polyvinylpyrrolidone, or one or more components of the 
effervescent system, such as, in particular, an edible, 

organic acid, for example alginic acid, citric acid, 
tartaric acid or adipic acid, or at least one alkali 

metal and/or alkaline earth metal carbonate and/or 
bicarbonate.  

 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the active ingredient is 

present in an amount of less than 60 mg, preferably 
less than 10 mg, and the matrix is present in an amount 

of 1 to 10, preferably 3 to 5, times the amount of 
active ingredient per tablet or granule dose. 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, for an active ingredient for the treatment of 

diarrhoea, such as, for example, loperamide, 
characterised in that it additionally contains a 

mixture which serves to compensate the electrolyte loss 
in the body and an amount of alkali metal and/or 

alkaline earth metal salts, preferably of organic 
salts, and of chlorides. 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that the matrix furthermore 

contains at least one of the substances gluconic acid 
delta-lactone, citric acid or alkali metal or alkaline 

earth metal carbonates or bicarbonates. 
Formulation according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that it contains at leapt one 

polymethacrylate, preferably Eudragit L alone or as a 
mixture with Eudragit S. 
Process for the preparation of a formulation

in that the active ingredient is dissolved with the 
matrix in a common solvent, preferably at slightly 

elevated temperature, the solution is uniformly applied 
to 10-50, preferably to 20-40, parts by weight (based 

on 1 part by weight of the sum of the active ingredient 
and matrix) of a neutral carrier and is dried, 

whereupon the granules obtained are mixed with the 
remaining effervescent and/or disintegration components
