<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dye-donor elements 
used in thermal dye transfer, and more particularly to 
the use of mixtures of certain 2-carbamoyl-4-[N-(p-aminoaryl)-imino]-1,4-naphthoquinone 
dyes in order to 
reduce dye crystallization. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to one of the cyan, magenta 
or yellow signals, and the process is then repeated for 
the other two colors. A color hard copy is thus 
obtained which corresponds to the original picture 
viewed on a screen. Further details of this process 
and an apparatus for carrying it out are contained in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,621,271. JP60/239,289 and U.S. Patents 4,695,287 and 
4,912,084 disclose the use of 2-carbamoyl-4-[N-(p-aminoaryl)-imino]-1,4-naphthoquinone 
dyes in thermal 
dye-donor elements. Dye-donor elements for use in 
thermal dye transfer imaging must be able to withstand  
 
periods of storage under adverse conditions of heat and 
humidity without exhibiting changes in performance. A 
problem that has developed with use of the above dyes 
is a tendency for the dyes to crystallize upon storage. 
Areas of crystal growth in the dye-donor element will 
produce noticeable and unacceptable areas of 
nonuniformity upon thermal transfer of the dye to a 
dye-receiving element. It is an object of this 
invention to provide dye-donor elements employing 2-carbamoyl-4-[N-(p-aminoaryl)-imino]-1,4-naphthoquinone 
dyes which reduces this crystallization problem. These and other objects are achieved in 
accordance with this invention which comprises a cyan 
dye-donor element for thermal dye transfer imaging 
comprising a support having thereon a dye layer 
comprising a dye dispersed in
