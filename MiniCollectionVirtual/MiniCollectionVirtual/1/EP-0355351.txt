<ABSTRACT>
Products of the reaction of oxo compounds and amines or ammonia, in which at least one substituent is aromatic and is substituted once to three times by halogen, can be catalytically hydrogenated to the relevant amines, with the halogen being essentially completely retained when an Ni-containing or Co-containing catalyst is employed in the presence of organic sulphur compounds.
