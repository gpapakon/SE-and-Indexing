<ABSTRACT>
A hygienic tank lorry pump for pumping liquid articles of food, 
such as milk, from a stationary tank (20) to the tank (2) 

of a tank lorry for 
pumping between the latter tank (2) and a trailer tank coupled to the 

tank lorry. The hygienic pump is formed by a side channel pump 
which can be driven by a hydraulic motor (17) in turn driven by a 

hydraulic system (6) of the tank lorry. As a result the tank lorry pump 
is self-priming, presents a high capacity relative to weight, as well 

as satisfying, simple cleaning possibilities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a hygienic tank lorry for transport of milk, said
lorry having a pump for pumping the milk from a stationary tank on the
ground to a tank on the lorry or between the latter tank and a trailer tank
coupled to the tank lorry, the latter having a hydraulic system. Such a lorry is known from WO-A-8 503 572.Previously, a hygienic tank lorry pump of the self-priming type was used
for pumping milk from the stationary milk tank of a farmer into the
mobile tank lorry of the dairy. When the tank lorry is coupled to a trailer
tank, viz. a trailer for a lorry, the pump in question is often used for
pumping milk from the tank of the tank lorry into the trailer tank. At the
dairy the tank of the tank lorry and the trailer tank are, however, emptied
by means of another pump.Previously either a vacuum pump, viz. a rotor compressor or a rotor
vacuum pump, or a conventional liquid ring pump was used as tank lorry
pump due to the demand for an automatic drawing capacity, said pumps
being provided with either eccentrically arranged rotor blades or with
worm/screw in the liquid ring.The structure of vacuum pumps provides said pumps with a satisfying
self-priming capacity, but the pumping capacity (m3/h) is very low with
the result that the users face long operation periods and a reduced efficiency
of the tank lorry. In addition, a vacuum pump must be disassembled
when it is to be cleaned.Conventional liquid ring pumps are seldomly used because they must be
very large, heavy, and energy-demanding in order to yield the necessary 
capacity. These pumps are not hygienic either as they cannot be satisfactorily
cleaned.DE-A-14 73 052 relates to a milk pump device which is movable and
which may be placed on a lorry. Besides pumping, the device may meter
the milk. There is no reference to a side channel pump.GB-A-953 883 relates to a transportable pump assembly, the pump being
a side channel pump. There is no reference to any tank lorry or the
pumped liquid being milk.The object of the invention is to provide a tank lorry of the above type
where the pump combines the ability to be self-priming, high capacity
1relative to the weight, simple cleaning possibilities and gentle pumping
of raw milk.The hygienic tank lorry according to the invention is characterised in that
the pump is a self-priming side channel pump, which is driven by a hydraulic
motor on the lorry, said motor in turn being driven by the hydraulic
system. In this manner a satisfying automatic drawing capacity
combined with a high pumping

<CLAIMS>
A hygienic tank lorry (1) for transport of milk, said lorry having
a pump for pumping the milk from a stationary tank (20) on the ground

to a tank (2) on the lorry (1) or between the latter tank (12) and a trailer
tank coupled to the tank lorry (1), the latter having a hydraulic system (6),

characterised in that the pump is a self-priming side channel pump (30),
which is driven by a hydraulic motor (17) on the lorry, said motor in turn

being driven by the hydraulic system (6).
A lorry as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the central shaft
(9) of the side channel pump (30) is mounted on a countershaft (13)

mounted in a bearing housing (14), said countershaft being connected to
the drive shaft (15) on the hydraulic motor (17).
A lorry as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the side
channel pump (30) is provided with a drain cock (at 16) for securing

against frost and removal of residues of CIP-liquid (CIP = clean in
place).
A lorry as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the side
channel pump (30) is mounted on the lorry (1) adjacent the inlet (4) of the

tank (2) in such a manner that a reliable priming of the pump (30) is
allowed when said pump is to be started either by way of a natural inlet

of milk from one of the tanks or by way of a manual priming or a self-priming.
A lorry as claimed in claim 4, characterised in that the side channel
pump (30) is mounted in an optionally height-adjustable hygienic box (3), 

and that the bearing housing (14) is optionally mounted in a wall in the
box (3), the hydraulic motor (17) being mounted on the outside of the box

(3).
