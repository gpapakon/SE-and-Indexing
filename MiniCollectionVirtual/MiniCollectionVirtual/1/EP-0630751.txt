<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet
recording method and apparatus in which ink is ejected
from recording head to a recording material to effect
the recording.In a recording apparatus such as a printer,
copying machine, facsimile machine or the like, an
image constituted by a dot pattern is recorded on a
recording material such as paper or a thin sheet of
plastic material in accordance with image information.
The recording apparatus is classified depending on the
recording system into an ink jet type, a wire dot
type, a thermal type, a laser beam type and the like.
Among them, the ink jet type (ink jet recording
apparatus) is such that ink (recording liquid)
droplets are ejected through ejection outlets of a
recording head, to effect the recording by deposition
of the ink on the recording material.Recently, various types of recording
apparatuses are used, and high speed recording, high
resolution, high image quality, low noise or the like
are desired for these recording apparatuses. To meet
the requirement, the ink jet recording apparatus is
suitable. Since non-contact printing is possible
because of ejecting the ink from the recording head, 
very stabilized images can be printed.However, it uses ink which is liquid, and
therefore, if the recording head is driven at or
adjacent a critical printing speed, various
hydromechanism inconveniences arise. In addition,
since the ink is liquid, the physical states thereof
such as viscosity or surface tension or the like
change due to ambient temperature or the time period
in which it is not used. For example, even if
printing is possible in an initial state, printing
may become difficult due to the increase of the vacuum
due to the decrease of the ambient temperature and/or
the decrease of the remaining quantity of the ink in
the container, or the like.In many prior art printers, a plurality of
nozzles are all driven in as short period as possible so
as to record a vertical line as a straight line. In
most cases, several tens nozzles are grouped into
blocks each containing several-16 nozzles
approximately, and they are simultaneously driven to
accomplish high speed operation. In this case, if the
apparatus is driven adjacent critical ejection period,
the refilling of the ink to the nozzle is not quick
enough with the result that the next ejection starts
before the ink is sufficiently refilled. If this
occurs, improper ejection or extreme reduction of the
ejected quantity, occur. Particularly when, a great 
number of nozzles are driven in short period of
