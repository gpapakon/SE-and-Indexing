<ABSTRACT>
Each of a plurality of base stations in a 
mobile radio communication system has a plurality of 

sectoral zones each having a directional antenna of 
horizontal directivity pattern. Radio channels are 

divided into as many groups as the number of sectoral 
zones per base station. The channel groups are assigned 

to the sectoral zones as the preferential allocation 
channel groups in such a manner that the same channel 

groups are assigned to the sectoral zones which have 
substantially the same directions determined by antenna 

directivity. When a request for communication occurs 
within a sectoral zone, channels are selected from the 

channel group assigned to the sectoral zone. If the 
carrier-to-interference power ratio of a selected channel 

is equal to or greater than a predetermined value, 
the selected channel is allocated. The mobile radio 

communication system thus has improved channel utilization 
efficiency to accommodate more traffic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
allocating radio channels for a cellular radio
communication system in which each base station covers a
plurality of sectoral zones with a plurality of antennas
each having a sectoral directivity pattern in a
horizontal plane.Mobile communication systems such as automobile
telephone systems employ the same channel repeatedly
in zones which are free from mutual interference for
effective utilization of frequencies. There are available
two channel allocation methods, i.e., the fixed
channel allocation method and the dynamic channel allocation
method. According to the fixed channel allocation
method, specified channels are fixedly allocated to
each zone in view of interference conditions. According
to the dynamic channel allocation method, channels are
not allocated to each zone in a fixed manner, but a base
station selects one of all channels per communication
request, measures the carrier-to-interference power
ratio (hereinafter referred to as "CIR") of the selected
channel, and allocates the selected channel if the
measured CIR is higher than a predetermined threshold 
value (hereinafter referred to as "CIR threshold
value"). With the dynamic channel allocation method,
channels can effectively be utilized by a jumbo group
effect that is achieved when all base stations share and
allocate all channels. Further, since a channel can
repeatedly be used if the CIR threshold value is satisfied,
the dynamic channel allocation method can realize
a shorter distance of repeated use of the same channel
than the fixed channel allocation method. Therefore,
the dynamic channel allocation method has a higher
frequency utilization efficiency than the fixed channel
allocation method.Zones of mobile communication systems may be
arranged in either an omnidirectional zone configuration
or a sectoral zone configuration. In the
omnidirectional zone configuration, a base station has
an antenna having an omnidirectional directivity pattern
in a horizontal plane, and one zone around one antenna
is covered by one base station. In the sectoral zone
configuration, a base station has a plurality of
antennas each having a sectoral directivity pattern in a
horizontal plane, and a plurality of sectoral zones are
covered by this base station. Since the same channel
interference is low due to the antenna directivity, and
the distance for repeatedly using the same channel is
shorter than in the omnidirectional zone configuration,
the sectoral zone configuration has a higher frequency 
utilizatio
