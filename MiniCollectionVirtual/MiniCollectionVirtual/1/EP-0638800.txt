<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for detecting a liquid/gas 
interface flowing in a transparent tube (12) comprises directing 

light radially through the transparent tube orthogonal to 
its longitudinal axis such that the radially directed light 

passing through the tube when filled with liquid thereat 
will extend substantially within a predetermined zone (14) and 

when filled with gas thereat will extend beyond the 
predetermined zone (14). Light is received at a position (14) 

diametrically opposite to a position (10) from which light is 
directed by receiving only light passing through the tube 

and extending beyond the predetermined zone. An output 
signal representative of liquid or gas in the tube is 

produced in response to the amount of light received. A 
second light receiver (15) disposed outside the zone is used to 

determine the direction of flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method and
apparatus for the discrimination between liquid and air in a
segmented flowing stream, such as one found in analytical
instrumentation, e.g., a clinical chemistry analyzer.Devices of this type, called bubble detectors in
these systems, are known in the prior art and use dedicated
light sources, such as light emitting diodes with relay
optics such as lenses and apertures close to the liquid
carrying tube to transmit light through the tube to a
photodetector on the opposite side of the stream.
Discrimination between liquid and air results from changes
in the light concentration on the photodetector due to the
difference in the refractive index of air and liquid within
the tube. Because the light passes through the liquid on
the way to the detector, variations in absorbance
characteristics of the liquid can influence the intensity of
light striking the photodetector, thereby affecting the
ratio of air to liquid signal.In other prior art optical bubble detectors, a
separate light path is used adjacent to a colorimetric
optical path, resulting in a bubble detection signal offset
in time from the analytic signal. Because of this offset,
timing compensation is required when taking data on segments
of the stream entering the colorimetric optical path. This 
is especially prolematic when the stream does not have a constant velocity ad the
time can vary from the bubble detector position to the colorimetric position of the
tube.Moreover, the signal level of these known detection systems rely on th
focusing effect of the liquid within the tube to increase the signal level, while air in
the tube reduces the signal level enabling discrimination between the two. The
wavelength of the bubble detector light must be chosen to avoid absorption of the
bubble detector light by the liquid within the tube and provisions must be made to
prevent the bubble detector light from influencing the colorimetric measurement.An example for a state-of-the-art device is given in FR-A 2 660 755. FR-A?
660 755 discloses a bubble detection device comprising two different detection
systems. The first detection system works on the basis of the refraction index. A light
source and a detector are arranged at a transparent tube such, that due to the refraction
of the liquid the light beam from the light source reaches the detector only, if there is
liquid in the tube and not gas. A big amount of light received at the detector indicates
the presence of a liquid in the tube, a low amount of light
