<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article incorporating a main body (10) 
which has a waist hole (1) and a pair of leg holes (2), an
d 
comprises a topsheet (12) positioned in a facing relation to 

a wearer's body, a backsheet (11) positioned opposite 
thereto, and an absorbent core (13) interposed between the 

backsheet and the topsheet. The topsheet can be in the form 
of a composite which comprises two layers (12a, 12b) of sheet 

material and two sets of elastic members (6a, 6b) sandwiched 
between the two sheets of material. The topsheet further has 

communicating means (20) disposed in a crotch region of the 
absorbent article for receiving body exudates. The 

communicating means is surrounded by the elastic members (6) 
which form leg gathers (2), and serves as a passage to 

communicate body exudates to a space defined between the 
topsheet and the backsheet. The absorbent article of the 

present invention can provide excellent flexibility, a snug 
fit and comfort to a wearer during use, while effectively 

preventing leakage from the leg gathers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an absorbent article according to the
preamble of claim 1.Such an absorbent article is known from EP-A-0 357 298 which
discloses a disposable absorbent article, such as a diaper having
a liquid impervious backsheet, an urine pervious liner and an
absorbent core intermediate the backsheet and the liner. The
liner has a passageway to allow communication of solid waste
materials to the core, thereby isolating such waste from the skin
of the wearer. The liner is longitudinally contracted by elastic
strands disposed longitudinally nonadjacent the passageway,
improving the fit of the article to the wearer without sacrificing
leakage protection and allowing various sections of the
article to assume independent functions. In order for the tapeless absorbent articles to fully
exhibit their advantageous characteristics, they need to
snugly fit to a user's body, particularly at leg hole
portions thereof. To this end, such tapeless absorbent
articles have elastically stretchable ruffles or leg gathers,
as they are generally called, along peripheries of the leg
holes.One example of such tapeless absorbent articles with leg
gathers is disclosed in Japanese Kokai Patent No. Hei
3-195558. Two sets of elastic members are attached along the
peripheries of the leg holes to form leg gathers. Each set
of elastic members extends along one leg hole from a front
end of the leg hole to a midpoint of the leg hole, and
continuously extends transversely of a central region (crotch
region) of the article to a midpoint of the other leg to form 
a cross-over portion. From the midpoint of the other leg
hole, each set of elastic members further extends therealong
to a rear end of the other leg hole. Those two sets of
elastic members are arranged so as to define a somewhat
X-shaped configuration.Such arrangement of the elastic members advantageously
facilitates a continuous manufacturing process of the
absorbent articles. Specifically, a liquid impermeable sheet
in a continuous web form is continuously transported in one
direction. Continuous elastic strands are fed onto the sheet
in a sinusoidal configuration for securement thereto. The
resultant combination is cut at a predetermined interval to
form a composite backsheet incorporating the elastic members
secured thereto.The elastic members arranged along peripheries of the
leg holes in the aforementioned, conventional tapeless
absorbent article function to form leg gathers therealong.
However, the elastic members extending transversely of the
crotch region not

An absorbent article comprising:

a main body (10) constructed to provide a waist hole (1)
and a pair of leg holes (2), and a crotch region, said main

body comprising a topsheet (12) for facing toward a wearer's
body, a backsheet (11) disposed outwardly of the topsheet,

and an absorbent core (13) interposed between the topsheet
and the backsheet,
said topsheet (12) having
elastic members (6a, 6b) secured thereto, and communicating

means (20) having a periphery for permitting fecal material
to pass therethrough in the crotch area of the article,

   characterized by a first set of elastic members (6a) extending along a
periphery of a first leg hole (2) from one end thereof to a

midpoint thereof, continuously extending therefrom along one
portion of said periphery of the communicating means to a

midpoint of a second leg hole (1), and further extending
therefrom to one end of the second leg hole (1) so that said

first set of elastic members (6a) are disposed in a
substantially U-shaped configuration, and
a second set of elastic members (6b) being disposed
to extend along peripheral portions of said first and second

leg holes (2) where said first set of elastic members (6a,
6b) are not disposed, wherein
a leg gather (4) is disposed along each of the leg holes.
An absorbent article according to claim 1, wherein a waist
gather (3) is disposed along the waist hole (1); and

said topsheet (12) comprises a dual-layered sheet material
(12a, 12b), the first and second sets of elastic members

(6a, 6b) being interposed between the dual sheet material. 
The absorbent article of claim 1 or 2, wherein

said second set of elastic members (6b) is disposed to
extend along the other portion of the periphery of said

communicating means (20) to define an inverted U-shaped
configuration.
