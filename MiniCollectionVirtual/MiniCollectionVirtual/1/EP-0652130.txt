<ABSTRACT>
When fastening permanent magnets to magnet supports, it is provided for each permanent magnet to be in the shape of two parallelepipeds located one on top of the other, the upper parallelepiped resting on a lower parallelepiped whose depth is the same as that of the upper parallelepiped and whose width is greater than that of the upper parallelepiped, the upper parallelepiped resting in such a way that the overlaps of the lower parallelepiped are of equal size on both sides, that the permanent magnets rest with the overlaps on the magnet support, that the holders rest on the overlaps and are screwed to the magnet supports in such a way that they press the permanent magnets onto the magnet supports and that the holders are of such a width that the required distance between the permanent magnets, and thus the correct pole division, is maintained.

Fastening of permanent magnets (1) on magnet carriers (8),
 
characterised thereby that each permanent magnet (1) has the form of two 

blocks resting on one another, wherein the upper block (11) rests on a 
lower block (12), the depth of which is the same as that of the upper 

block (11) and the width of which is greater than that of the upper block 
(11) and wherein the upper block (11) so rests that the overhangs (120) 

of the lower block (12) are equally large on both sides, that the 
permanent magnets (1) rest by the overhangs (120) on the magnet carrier 

(8), that holders (2) rest on the overhangs (120) and are so screw-connected 
with the magnet carriers (8) that they press the permanent 

magnets (1) onto the magnet carriers (8), and that the holders (2) have 
a width of such a kind that the required spacing of the permanent magnets 

(1) and thus the correct pole pitch is obtained. 
Fastening according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the 
holder (2) has an incision (20) which is continuous in its length and 

in which a pole position winding (7) is guided. 
Fastening according to 2, characterised thereby that the holder (2) 
has a cover (4) for protection of the pole position winding (7). 
Fastening according to one of the preceeding claims, characterised 
thereby that an iron metal strip (3) is inserted between the holders (2) 

and the overhangs (120) of the permanent magnets (1). 
Fastening according to one of the preceeding claims, characterised 
thereby that the holder (2) has at both ends a support (23) for support 

of the portions of the pole position winding (7) which are disposed 
laterally of the permanent magnets. 
Fastening according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the 
portions of the pole position winding (7) which are disposed laterally 

of the permanent magnets are covered by strips (5). 
Fastening according to claim 6, characterised thereby that the 
strips (5) are fastened by snap closures (51) in the receptacles of the  

 
holder (2). 
Fastening according to one of the foregoing claims, characterised 
thereby that the permanent magnet (1) consists of neodymium iron which is 

enclosed by a skin of noble metal, which was welded by laser. 
Method for the fastening of permanent magnets (1) according to 
claim 1 on magnet carriers (8) by means of holders (2) according to claim 

1, characterised thereby that initially a holder (2) is screwed onto the 
magnet carrier (8), that then a permanent magnet (1) is so pushed against 

the holder (2) that the holder (2) rests partly on the overhang (120), 
that a second holder (2) is screwed onto the magnet carrier(8) and partly 

rests on the second overhang of the first permanent magnet (1), that the 
first holder (2) is tightened, that then a second permanent magnet (1) is 

pushed against the second holder (2) and a third holder (2) is so screwed 
onto the magnet carrier that it partly rests on the second overhang of 

the second permanent magnet, that then the second holder (2) is tightened, 
and that the remaining permanent magnets (1) are correspondingly fastened 

by holders (2). 
Method according to claim 9 for fastening of permanent magnets (1) 
according to claim 1 on magnet carriers (8) by means of holders (2) 

according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised thereby that after the 
fastening of the permanent magnets (1) by the holders (2) a pole position 

winding (7) is laid and this is then covered by covers (4) and strips (5).
