<ABSTRACT>
An open-out window in the body of a motor vehicle, in which the window pane (1) or window which is to be opened out can pivot about an essentially vertical pivot axis which is located at the front in the direction of travel, and can be locked in the respective opened-out position, is to be constructed in such a way that the window can be easily mounted and can be manufactured with low overall costs. For this purpose, it is provided according to the invention for clamp elements (2) which consist of metal and are arranged at a distance from one another over the circumference of the window pane to engage over the window pane (1) and to have two legs (2a, 2b) which rest one opposite the other on the surface of the window pane and which are held tight on the edge of the window pane by a bonding agent (3) which is arranged between clamp element and window pane, the clamp elements being arranged on supports (4, 5) which can also be attached to the body of the vehicle at a distance from one another and consist of sheet metal and have a bent-over section which is located in the region of the window pane and engages over the outer surface of one or other leg, the entire arrangement being surrounded by a frame (6) which can consist of PVC or other materials such as elastomer or the like and which is applied to the edge of the window pane by encapsulation by injection moulding.

<CLAIMS>
Openable bodywork window for motor vehicles, in 
which the window to be opened can be pivoted about an 

essentially vertical pivot axis, located at the front in 
the direction of travel, and can be locked in the 

respective opened position, characterized in that the 
window (1) is gripped by metal clamp elements (2) which 

are arranged at a distance apart from one another on the 
window periphery and exhibit two legs (2a, 2b) which bear 

on the window surface such that they are located opposite 
one another and which are fixed on the window border by 

an adhesive arranged between clamp element (2) and window 
(1), the clamp elements (2) being arranged on supports 

(4, 5) which can be fastened, likewise at a distance 
apart from one another, on the bodywork, consist of sheet 

metal and exhibit an angle section (5) which is located 
in the region of the window (1) and grips over the outer 

surface of one or the other leg (2a, 2b), and the entire 
arrangement being enclosed by a frame (6), which may 

consist of PVC or other materials, such as elastomers or 
the like, and is applied on the border of the window (1) 

by encapsulation. 
Openable window according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the metal support plate (4) exhibits a 

metal-plate section (5) which is bent essentially at 
right angles, which is not longer than the clamp elements 

(2), and the angle of which forms the pivot axis (7), 
which is located perpendicularly with respect to the 

drawing plane in Figures 1 and 2, for example, and about 
which the finished openable window can be pivoted. 
Method of producing an openable window according 
to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that, first of all, 

there is applied on the two surfaces of the window (1), 
in the border region thereof, a polyurethane-based 

adhesive (3), if appropriate after priming has been 
carried out, whereupon, in sections, the clamp elements 

(2) are fitted on to the window (1) together with their 
supports (4, 5) and are adhesively bonded to said window, 

and whereupon the entire arrangement is encapsulated for  
 

the formation of a frame (6). 
Openable window according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the individual clamp element (4) 

[sic] is formed in one piece with the support section (5) 

arranged in its outer region. 
Openable window according to one Claims 1, 2 and 
4, characterized in that the angle section (5) of the 

metal support plate (4) grips over the respectively outer 
leg (2b) of the clamp element (2). 
Openable window according to one of Claims 1, 2 
and 4 and 5, characterized in that the two legs (2a, 2b) 

of the clamp element (2) are provided with through-passage 
openings (12) through which the frame material 

can pass as far as the window (1) during the encapsulation 
process, this resulting in secure fixing of the 

window (1) within the frame (6). 
Openable window according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that, if a leg (2b) of the clamp element and of 

the angle section (5) of the metal support plate (4) lie 
one upon the other, the bores or through-passages (12) 

can be made in the two parts simultaneously in one 
operation. 
Openable window according to one of Claims 1, 2 
and 4 to 7, characterized in that the metal support plate 

(4) comprises two sections (4, 5) located at right angles 
with respect to one another, the section (4), which is 

led out from within the motor vehicle, being connected to 
the bodywork plate (11) outside the encapsulating frame 

(6) by means of a retaining angle (10) or the like. 
Openable window according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that connection to the bodywork plate (1) [sic]
 
is carried out releasably by screwed-in screws (9). 
Openable window according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, and 9, in a bodywork with a vertical pillar of relatively 

large cross-section in the window region, in which 
pillar the frame of the bodywork window is arranged, 

characterized in that the fastening screw (21) is 
installed in a position rotated through 90Â°, with the 

result that its axis is oriented towards the cross-section  
 

centre point of the pillar (20), and that the 
fastening screw (21) has a relatively flat head (22) in 

the region of the frame (6). 
Openable window according to Claim 10, characterized 
in that the support (4) is angled three times, to be 

precise firstly at right angles in the anticlockwise 
direction immediately adjoining the clamp element (2), 

secondly in the clockwise direction at right angles in 
the direction of the pillar (2), and thirdly in the 

clockwise direction, this resulting in a support piece 
(4a) which runs parallel to the support piece (4c) which 

immediately adjoins the clamp element (2).
