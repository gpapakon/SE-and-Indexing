<ABSTRACT>
In a communication system from a mobile station 
to a base station, a transmitter of the mobile station 

subjects a sequence of transmission signals to both of 
time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division 

multiple access (CDMA) to produce a radio output signal 
located in a time slot of a frame. The radio output 

signal obtained by the TDMA and CDMA is filtered or 
inversely spread to remove interference and noise from 

the radio output signal by the use of an adaptive filter 
which has taps controlled by an adaptive controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a mobile communication
system which includes a base station and a mobile station
communicable with the base station and, in particular, to
a transmitter and a receiver used in the mobile
communication system.In general, such a mobile communication system of
the type described is known in the art as a cellular
system. Conventionally, a wide variety of the cellular
systems have been proposed, which may be, such as a
standard system in Japan abbreviated to PDC:RCR STD 27A,
a North American standard system abbreviated to TIA IS54,
an Europe Standard system abbreviated to ETSI GSM, and
another North American standard system abbreviated to TIA
IS95. Herein, it is to be noted that the PDC:RCR STD 27A
uses a time division multiple access (TDMA) method while
the TIA IS95 uses a code division multiple access (CDMA)
method.In the TDMA method, it is difficult to avoid a
frequency interference which might result from use of an
identical frequency. Therefore, the identical frequency 
can not be assigned to adjacent ones of cells but should
be used in remote cells. Accordingly, the TDMA method
has a shortcoming that a utilization efficiency of
frequencies is low.On the other hand, the CDMA method is
advantageous in that the same frequencies can be used in
every one of cells and that a path diversity effect can
be accomplished by the use of a simple rake receiver
which is well known in the art.However, it is difficult in the CDMA method that
an interference among channels can not be completely
rendered into zero. From this fact, it is readily
understood that the CDMA method is not suitable for
simultaneously transmitting a plurality of information
signals which are individually produced from different
signal sources.Herein, proposal has been made in U.S. Patent No.
4,799,252 as regards another mobile communication system
that comprises a plurality of base stations and a
plurality of mobile stations communicable with the base
stations through forward links and reverse links and that
carries out communication by using a combination of time
division multiplexing (TDM) and code division multiplexing
(CDM). The forward links are directed from the base
stations towards the mobile stations while the reverse
links are directed from the mobile stations towards the
base stations. Herein, it is to be noted in the above-referenced
U.S. Patent that the combination of the TDM and the CDM
is only used in the forward links from each of the base
stations to the mobile stations to accurately synchronize
