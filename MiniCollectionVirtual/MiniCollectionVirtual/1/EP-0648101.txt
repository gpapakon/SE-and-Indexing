<ABSTRACT>
A thin, layered, absorbent structure comprises first and second layers (1, 2) of fibrous material and an intermediate layer (5) comprising particles of a hydrogelling, absorbent material (6) and particles of a thermoplastic, polymeric, organic material (7); the first and second fibrous layers (1, 2) extend beyond the intermediate layer (5) laterally to form longitudinal edge portions (8). The two fibrous layers (1, 2) are bound together with the intermediate layer (5) between them by the melting of the particles of thermoplastic, polymeric, organic material (7) and by means of a continuous line (10) of adhesive extending longitudinally on each longitudinal edge portion (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to layered, absorbent
structures constituted by fibrous layers with particles
of hydrogelling absorbent material.The structures may be used as absorbent elements in
disposable absorbent articles such as sanitary towels,
dressings, babies' nappies and the like.Disposable absorbent articles are well known and all
have absorbent elements for absorbing and retaining
body fluids; an absorbent element must be able to
acquire liquid rapidly and to distribute it internally
so as to prevent leakages and must also have a good
capacity to retain the fluids when subjected to the
normal pressures of use.Absorbent elements made mainly of hydrophilic fibrous
material such as, for example, pads of cellulose
fibres, layers of wadding, or the like generally have
satisfactory characteristics as regards their
liquid-absorption rate and can distribute the liquid
effectively within them but are very ineffective from
the point of view of retention when subjected to the
normal pressures of use.The use of hydrogelling absorbent materials in
combination with hydrophilic fibres in order to
increase the absorption and retention capacities of the
absorbent elements is known.Hydrogelling absorbent materials, commonly known as
superabsorbents, are polymers which can swell up and
absorb large quantities of liquid, particularly water, 
or also, to a lesser extent, body fluids.They also have the particular property that they retain
the fluids even under moderate pressure; owing to this
characteristic, their use in absorbent elements for
disposable absorbent articles has been proposed for
some time.The high absorption capacity of superabsorbents is not,
however, combined with similarly rapid absorption and
this may adversely affect the performance of absorbent
articles incorporating these substances.In fact, superabsorbents may give rise to a phenomenon
defined as "gel blocking"; when a particle of
superabsorbent is in contact with the liquid, its
external surface starts to absorb the liquid and swells
up obstructing the transmission of the liquid into the
particle itself; the liquid can penetrate further into
the still-dry core of the particle only by means of a
very slow diffusion mechanism.This phenomenon may prevent full use being made of the
large absorption capacities of superabsorbent
substances.Leaving out of consideration the type of superabsorbent
material and the shapes and sizes of the particles,
"gel blocking" is generally encouraged by the formation
of agglomerations of superabsorbent particles
