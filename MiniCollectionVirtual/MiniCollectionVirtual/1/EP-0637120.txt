<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for converting energy stored in a magnetic field into kinetic energy. According to the invention, this device is designed in such a manner that at least two non-magnetic holders are arranged, radially opposite one another, on a wheel (22) which is mounted such that it can rotate, said holders acting as guides for in each case at least two permanent magnets (31, 31'; 32, 32') which are mounted displaceably therein. A plate (28) made of magnetic material is in each case arranged axially on both sides adjacent to the wheel (22), partially covering it. A compressible pressure element is arranged such that it acts on the permanent magnet (31, 32) which is located radially further outwards, or such that it acts between the two permanent magnets, depending on the pole orientation of the two poles (S, N), namely with similar poles or dissimilar poles pointing towards one another.
