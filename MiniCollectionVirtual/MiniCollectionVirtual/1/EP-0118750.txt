<ABSTRACT>
In a process wherein a first substrate is oxidized and 
NAD(P) is reduced in the presence of a first NAD(P) 

cofactor-linked oxidoreductase enzyme to form a first reac­
tion product and NAD(P)H₂, and subsequently a second 

substrate and the resulting NAD(P)H₂ are reacted in the 
presence of a second NAD(P) cofactor-linked oxidoreductase 

enzyme to form a second reaction product and NAD(P), the 
improvement which comprises reacting said second reaction 

product with oxygen in the presence of an oxidase enzyme to 
regenerate said second substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>

 REGENERATION OF NAD(P) COFACTOR
 This invention relates to the regeneration of the cofactor   NAD(P)    using a multi-enzyme system. More specifically, this invention relates to an improved, more efficient process for the regeneration of
NAD(P) which is required as a coenzyme or cofactor in oxidative reactions catalyzed by dehydrogenase enzymes.


 There are over 2500 known enzymes and over one-third of these require cofactor molecules to function as catalysts. The enzymes which require   nicotine-adenine-dinucleotide,    more commonly called NAD or nicotine-adenine-dinucleotide-phosphate, NADP, are called dehydrogenases or reductases. Collectively, these two cofactors are referred to as
NAD(P). These enzymes which require cofactors are being increasingly used to achieve selective chemical conversions. For example, U.S.


3,331,752 discloses that NAD(P) is used as a cofactor to aid dehydrogenases in oxidizing substrates while simultaneously the NAD(P) is transformed to its reduced form   NAD(P)H2.   


 It is also known in the art that NAD(P) can be regenerated from
NAD(P)H2. U.S. 3,862,012 discloses that   NAD(P)    is regenerated from
NAD(P)H2 in the presence of acetaldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenase.


 The combination of reactions into one system wherein NAD(P) is reduced to NAD(P)H2 and subsequently regenerated therefrom has been disclosed in the art as, for example, in Enzyme Engineering, vol. 3, pp.


371-377 (1978). This system may be generalized by the following reactions: (1) reduced substrate + NAD(P)
EMI1.1     
 oxidized substrate +   NAD(P)H2.     


(2)   NAD(P)H2    + aldehyde
EMI2.1     
 alcohol + NAD(P)
The overall reaction, therefore, is: (3) reduced substrate + aldehyde
EMI2.2     
 oxidized substrate + alcohol
Because of the relative high cost of NAD(P), its efficient regeneration is highly desirable. While the above system accomplishes the latter, it still has some disadvantages.- For example, the formation of stoichiometric amounts of alcohol from aldehyde as shown in equation (3) complicates the isolation and purification of the oxidized substrate. If the alcohol was not present, then isolation and purification of the oxidized substrate would be more readily accomplished.


 A further disadvantage of the above two enzyme system lies in the fact that many NAD(P) cofactor-linked dehydrogenase reactions are readily reversible and their energy driving force, commonly called AG, can be relatively small. Therefore, large concentrations of aldehyde must often be maintained in a two
