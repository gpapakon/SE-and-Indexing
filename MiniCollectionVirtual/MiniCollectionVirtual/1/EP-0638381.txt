<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cast housing, especially for hydraulic conveying means, having regions which can be subjected to pressure and/or are to be sealed off and having passages designed to carry the medium to be delivered and cast simultaneously in the housing. It is envisaged that the regions should be assigned at least one pressurizable pressure space which exerts a reaction pressure on the regions, the pressure space being formed simultaneously with the casting of the housing (26), and the passages furthermore being formed by cores (16) which remain at least partially in the housing (26) after it has been cast.

A housing (26), in particular for a hydraulic conveying device (24), consisting of a 

casting, with areas (76) which can be acted upon with pressure and/or which are to be 
sealed off, 
characterized in that
 at least one pressure chamber (74) to be acted upon 
with pressure is associated with the areas (76), the pressure chamber (74) is arranged 

substantially parallel to the area (76), the areas (76) can be acted upon with forces resulting 
from the pressure in the pressure chamber (74) and counteracting the pressure forces, 

and the pressure chamber (74) is connected by way of at least one connexion (72) to 
areas which can be acted upon with pressure by a medium to be conveyed, and the at 

least one pressure chamber (74) and the at least one connexion (72) can be produced 
at the same time as the casting of at least one part (54) of the housing (26). 
A housing according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pressure chamber (74) is 
formed by at least one core (16) inserted in the casting mould and remaining at least in 

part in the housing (26) after the casting procedure. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the core (16) 
consists of a solid, porous, high-strength material. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the core (16) 
consists of aluminium oxide (Al
2
O
3
). 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the core (16) 
is constructed in two parts and comprises an inner part and an outer part embracing the 

inner part. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the inner part 
and the outer part remain in the housing (26) after the casting procedure and form the pressure 

chamber. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the inner part 
consists of a solid, porous, high-strength material. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the inner part 
consists of aluminium oxide (Al
2
O
3
).  
 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the outer part 
is constructed as a hollow body. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the hollow 
body consists of a high-strength, dimensionally rigid material. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the inner part 
is formed by a filling (22) which is removed after the casting procedure, so that only the 

outer part remains in the housing (26). 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the core (16) 
comprises exclusively an outer part (hollow body) which remains in the housing (26) 

after the casting procedure. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the connexion 
(72) is cast into the housing (26) simultaneously with the pressure chamber. 
A housing according to one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that
 the connexion 
(72) can be produced by a suitable boring of the pressure chamber.
