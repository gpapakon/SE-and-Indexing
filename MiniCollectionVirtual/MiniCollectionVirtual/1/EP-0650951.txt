<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for inhibiting the
formation of undesired colored contaminating products during
process steps involving thermal treating of distillation where
4,4'(dyhydroxyphenyl)propan-2 is present.US-A-5185475 discloses a method for preparing
paracumylphenol by reacting alpha methylstyrene with
phenol. The color of the product can be improved by the
addition of hypophosphorous acid.JP-A-2212447 discloses the preparation of 4,4'-dihydroxytetraphenylmethanes
having improved color tone
due to the addition of hypophosphorous acid.The dihydric phenols have achieved significant success in their
commercial applications. Dihydric phenols are useful in the
commercial manufacture of various polymers including the
polyarylates, polyamides, epoxides, polyetherimides, polysulfones,
and the polycarbonates. Significant attention has been directed to
the commercial preparation of the dihydric phenols. For many years
it has been well known that the acid catalyzed reaction of phenol
with specific aldehydes or ketones could prepare the 4,4'-dihydric
phenol with specific groups derived from the aldehyde or ketone
connecting the two phenolic rings. In particular when the phenol is
reacted with acetone, the dihydric phenol
4,4'(dihydroxyphenyl)propane-2, hereafter referred to as bisphenol-A,
is formed. This compound has particular utility in the synthesis
and preparation of polycarbonates, polyarylates, and
copolyestercarbonates as well as epoxies. In order to manufacture
certain polymers, in particular the polycarbonates, the bisphenol-A
must have a high level of freedom from impurities. In particular, this
freedom from impurities must manifest itself as a freedom from
impurities imparting an undesirable color either to the bisphenol-A
or the products manufactured therefrom.Additionally, since the process to manufacture bisphenol-A
contributes substantially to the final cost of products manufactured
therefrom, the process should be particularly efficient. Consequently
much attention has been directed to the recovery of bisphenol-A 
after its preparation. Because of the economic factors involved,
recovery of bisphenol-A from every process stream where it occurs
can be significant in terms of increasing the yield of bisphenol-A and
also reducing its cost. Thus various side or purge-streams have
been evaluated for their potential in terms of recovery of bisphenol-A.In the down stream processing of the composition resulting
from the acid catalyzed condensation reaction, a loss in the quantity
of
