<ABSTRACT>
An objective lens (20) and an optical scanning device 
(30, 20, 50) provided with such a lens are described, of which lens both 

surfaces (22, 23), viewed from the object side, are concave, while the 
focal length is considerably smaller than its thickness (d) of along the 

axis and the surface (23) at the image side is aspherical. When using 
this objective lens, the scanning device may be very compact.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an objective lens for focusing a 
diverging radiation beam into a diffraction-limited radiation spot, 
comprising a single lens body of transparent material having a first 
refractive surface at the object side and a second refractive surface at 
the image side, at least one of said surfaces being aspherical. The 
invention also relates to an optical scanning device provided with such 
a lens. Such a lens and scanning device are known from United 
States Patent Specification no. 4,668,056. In the embodiment described 
in said Patent Specification in which a diverging beam emitted by a 
radiation source is focused to a diffraction-limited radiation spot 
having a half-value width of the order of 1 µm on an information plane 
of a transparent record carrier, the objective lens is a biconvex lens 
one of whose refractive surfaces is aspherical. An aspherical lens 
surface is understood to mean a surface whose fundamental shape is 
spherical but whose real shape has small deviations therefrom so as to 
correct for spherical aberrations of the fundamental shape. The known 
lens has a relatively large diffraction-limited image field with a 
diameter of the order of 200 µm so that a sharp radiation spot can also 
be formed in the surroundings of the optical axis enabling the position 
of the scanning spot with respect to a pattern of tracks to be scanned 
in the information plane to be corrected by displacing the objective 
lens and the scanning beam with respect to each other. The build-in length, from the radiation source to the 
information plane, of the known device is roughly given by 
(M+ 1 / M+2).f+hh′ in which M is the magnification, f is the focal 
length, i.e. the distance between the object focus and the object 
principal point, and hh′ the distance between the main surfaces H and 
H′ of the objective lens. For a thin lens the term hh′ is negligible 
with respect to the left term. The build-in length of the said 
embodiment, in which the magnification is of the order of 4.5 and the 
focal length is of the order of 3.2 mm, is approximately 20 mm. To  
 
reduce the buil-in length while ensuring the same magnification, the 
focal length should have to be reduced. However, problems may then occur 
in connection with the desired free working distance of the objective 
lens when using it for scanning an information plane in a record 
carrier. In fact, this information layer is located behind a transparent 
substrate having a given thickness, for example 1.2 mm, while the record
