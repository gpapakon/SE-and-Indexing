<ABSTRACT>
In a catching basket for lawnmowers, there is engaged in the cover a U-shaped frame which encloses a pattern of perforation holes and which supports a pivoting flap which, in dependence on the air stream passing through the pattern of perforations, can be transferred out of a specific closing position into a specific opening position when the catching basket is filled with grass.

<CLAIMS>
Device for indicating the level in the grassbox (10) of
lawn-mowers in which the cut grass is carried, by means of

an air flow, into the grassbox, from which part of the flow
flows through an aperture (28) provided with a flap (30),

with the air pressure depending on the level determining
the swivel position of the flap, distinguished by the fact

that the flap (30) is housed in a frame (20, 22), which can
be locked into locking recesses of the grassbox cover (14)

with locking catches (24, 26), the recesses being arranged
around the air throughput aperture (28).
Device as Claim 1,

distinguished by the fact that the frame (20) is U-shaped,
and is closed off by a transverse wall (22), and the

articulated axle links the ends of the U-sides.
Device as Claims 1 and 2,

distinguished by the fact that the frame (20, 22) is
provided with at least one outlet aperture (42) on the edge

adjacent to the grassbox cover (14).
Device as Claim 3,

distinguished by the fact that an aperture (42) is provided
at the front and one at the rear.
Device as one of Claims 1-4,

distinguished by the fact that the U-frame has a rigid edge
(40) for the flap (30).
Device as Claim 1,

distinguished by the fact that the grassbox cover (14) has
a concentric bore pattern (28) at the back.
Device as Claim 1,

distinguished by the fact that the flap has flat indents 
(32) in the hinge area, which form spring contact studs

which carry hinge axle stubs (34).
Device as Claim 1,

distinguished by the fact that the swivelling axis of the
flap (30) runs transversely to the direction of travel and

is linked into the frame at the rear (in relation to the
direction of travel).
Device as one of Claims 1-8,

distinguished by the fact that the flap (30) carries
identification symbols (44) on the top face.
Device as Claim 1,

distinguished by the fact that a closure cover, which can
be locked onto the grassbox cover, covers the perforation

bores.
