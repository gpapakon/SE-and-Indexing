<ABSTRACT>
A digital frequency upconversion and downconversion scheme for receivers and transmitters enables high resolution downconversion and upconversion, respectively, with low phase noise. A digital signal processor (DSP) (230) receives temperature measurement information from a temperature transducer associated with a reference oscillator (240), and also receives channel tuning and other information. The DSP adjusts the signal samples accordingly, without adjusting the operation of the oscillator. Additionally, the inventive filtering scheme, preferably implemented in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), receives digital filtering coefficient information, digital symbol timing phase control signals, and, in some cases, other information from the DSP. As a result, the scheme enables operation at 1 Hz resolution, with phase noise which is at least 33.5 dB down at 10 Hz in the case of downconversion, and at least 42 dB down at 10 Hz in the case of upconversion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for effecting
frequency translation at microwave frequencies, and in particular to a frequency
translation scheme which works at L-band, using an analog-to-digital sampling
scheme which enables elimination of multiple-step mixer/local oscillator circuitry
at the front end. The invention contemplates applicability to both reception
(downconversion) and transmission (upconversion) at frequencies of 2 GHz or
less.Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a typical frequency-tunable RF-to-baseband
downconverter, employing a triple analog conversion scheme with a
quadrature third conversion stage. An L-band filter 102 filters an L-band RF
input from a low noise amplifier (LNA). A first amplifier 104 receives the
filtered output of the filter 102 and provides an amplified output to a first mixer
106, which also receives an output of a fixed local oscillator (LO) 120. The
output of mixer 106 is provided to a first intermediate frequency (IF) filter 108,
whose output is provided to a second amplifier 110, which comprises a variable
gain amplifier which is driven by an automatic gain control (AGC) signal derived
from demodulator 150.The output of amplifier 110 is provided to a second mixer 112, which also
receives an output of a tunable LO 122. The output of mixer 112 is provided to
a second IF filter 114, whose output in turn is provided to a third amplifier 116.
The output of amplifier is provided to mixers 132, 134. Mixer 132 receives an
output of fixed LO 124 which is 90° out of phase (via phase shifter 126) from
the LO 124 output which is provided to mixer 134. A high-stability frequency
reference oscillator 130 provides reference values to the respective LOs.The respective outputs of mixers 132, 134 are filtered in baseband filters
136, 138, and converted in respective analog-to-digital (A/D) converters 140,
142. The outputs of A/D converters 140, 142, which are quadrature and in-phase 
values, respectively, are provided to a digital signal processor (DSP) based
demodulator 150, which provides a demodulated output.Variations employing different numbers of conversion stages also are
known. In any event, each such conversion stage requires a mixer, an LO, and
a filter to remove the undesired mixer products. A variable gain amplifier,
which is placed in one of the stages for gain control, is driven by an AGC signal
derived from the demodulator.As shown in Figure 1, the second conversion stage uses a tunable LO for
channel selection. The third LO is split
