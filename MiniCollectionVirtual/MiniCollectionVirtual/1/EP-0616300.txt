<ABSTRACT>
Sheet counting apparatus comprises a set of rotatably 
mounted suction spindles (2-6) mounted for movement past a 

stack of sheets (26) to be counted. A pump (19) is 
connected to the spindles whereby as a suction spindle 

passes the stack, a vacuum is supplied to the spindle so 
that the topmost sheet is deflected from its initial 

position. A monitoring system (22,23) monitors the number 
of deflected sheets by monitoring the degree of vacuum 

within the suction spindle passing the stack whereby the 
monitoring system increments a count on each occasion when 

the monitored vacuum exceeds a predetermined threshold. 
The monitoring system terminates the count process when a 

predetermined period is exceeded without the vacuum 
exceeding the predetermined threshold, the predetermined 

period corresponding to the passage of at least two 
spindles pas the stack of sheets, without deflecting a 

sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is already known to provide apparatus for counting
sheets held in a stack, the apparatus comprising a set of
rotatably mounted suction spindles mounted for movement
past a stack of sheets to be counted, vacuum supply means
connected to the spindles, whereby as a suction spindle
passes the stack, a vacuum is supplied to the spindle so
that the topmost sheet is deflected from its initial
position; and monitoring means for monitoring the number of
deflected sheets. Such apparatus is hereinafter referred
to as of the kind described and is commonly referred to as
a "spindle counter".Most spindle counters require a minimum pressure
(vacuum) to be maintained within the system with the
counting being achieved by means of external
electromagnetic/photoelectric sensors which operate
independently of the vacuum system provided the minimum
pressure is maintained. An example is described in GB-A-2041888.Another approach is to detect changes in the pressure
or vacuum supplied to the spindles. An increase in vacuum
(decrease in pressure) corresponds to a sheet being
deflected and this change can be used to implement a count.
Examples of such spindle counters are described in GB-A-2238411,
GB-A-2238895, GB-A-2137000 and GB-A-1530652.In some of these known spindle counters, for example
those described in GB-A-2238411 and GB-A-2238895, it is
necessary to index the spindles to a known position prior
to the start of the count process. This is undesirable.A further problem with systems such as that described
in GB-A-2238895 is that if a spindle fails to deflect a
note during a count process, the system will stop. This
leads to problems in that the whole process has to be
restarted.The invention relates to an apparatus and method of counting sheets as
set out in claims 1 and 5.In accordance with one embodiment of the present
invention, we provide apparatus of the kind described 
wherein the monitoring means monitors the degree of vacuum
within the suction spindle passing the stack whereby the
monitoring means increments a count on each occasion when
the monitored vacuum exceeds a predetermined threshold, the
monitoring means terminating the count process when a
predetermined period is exceeded without the vacuum
exceeding the predetermined threshold, the predetermined
period corresponding to the passage of at least two
spindles past the stack without deflecting a sheet.In accordance with a second embodiment of the present
invention, a method of counting sheets using apparatus
comprising a set of rotatably mounted suction

mounted suction spindles (2-6) mounted for movement past a

stack of sheets (26) to be counted, vacuum supply means
(19) connected to the spindles whereby as a suction spindle

passes the stack, a vacuum is supplied to the spindle so
that the topmost sheet is deflected from its initial

position; and monitoring means (22,23) for monitoring the
number of deflected sheets, wherein the monitoring means

monitors the degree of vacuum within the suction spindle

tack whereby the monitoring means increments
a count on each occasion when the monitored vacuum exceeds

a predetermined threshold, the monitoring means terminating
the count process when a predetermined period is exceeded

without the vacuum exceeding the predetermined threshold,

to the passage of at least two spindles past the stack of
sheets without deflecting a sheet.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the
predetermined period is the same throughout a count

process.

comprising a central porting member (11) about which the

spindles (2-6) rotate, the central porting member having a
vacuum supply port (16) connected to the vacuum supply

means (19), and a vacuum sensing port (20) connected to the
monitoring means (22,23), the vacuum supply and sensing

ports (16,20) being positioned such that during rotation of
a spindle past the sheet stack, a spindle vacuum port (10)

will initially communicate only with the vacuum supply
port, then with both the vacuum supply and sensing ports,

and finally with only the vacuum sensing port.
