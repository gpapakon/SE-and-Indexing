<ABSTRACT>
In forming a first image and a second image on both sides of a 
recording paper by using an electrophotographic process, the first 

image is generated on a photosensitive drum (3a), and is 
transferred to an intermediate transfer belt (5) which can transfer 

and hold a developer image. The photosensitive drum (3a) and the 
intermediate transfer belt (5) is disposed across a plane where the 

recording paper is conveyed. Subsequently, the second image is 
generated on the photosensitive drum (3a) after a developer 

remaining thereon has been removed, and is transferred to one side 
of the recording paper. After the second image has been fixed on 

one side of the recording paper, the first image is transferred from 
the intermediate transfer belt (5) to the other side of the 

recording paper and fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming system using
an electrophotographic process, and more particularly to a method
of forming images on both sides of a recording paper and an image
forming apparatus having a double-side image forming function.An electrophotographic printer or a copying machine having a
double-side image forming function has been proposed from the
viewpoints of resource-saving and paper-saving in an office. In
JP-A-59-222860, a double-side
image forming system is disclosed in which two image forming
units are provided in a single printer and respective images are
formed on both sides of a recording paper by the two image forming
units. However, since the apparatus requires two image forming
units, it becomes a large size, as is a conventional copying
machine, and the cost also becomes higher. Then, in recent years,
there has been extensively adopted a switchback method in which an
image is formed on the obverse of a recording paper, the recording 
paper is then reversed by a switchback, and an image is formed on
the reverse of the paper
(JP-A-60-114876, and JP-A-63-54060).The switchback method, however, has a complicated paper
conveying path and requires a considerably wide space for reversing
a recording paper. Moreover, since the size of this necessary space
is proportional to the size of the recording paper, a printer
capable of handling a large paper is inevitably increased in size.
Also, since, after formation of an image on the obverse of the
recording paper, the paper is reversed and an image is formed on the
reverse of the paper, the paper conveying path becomes longer and
it is difficult to form an image at high speeds. Further, conveying
a recording paper complicatedly becomes a cause of paper jamming
and various countermeasures therefor are also needed.US-A-4,688,925 discloses an electrographic reproduction
apparatus having a single process assembly for forming
transferable images on a member moving along an image travel
path, a mechanism for producing duplex copies on receiver
sheets moving along a travel path spaced relative to such
image travel path. Such mechanism includes a pair of similar
doner rollers. The first doner roller is operatively
associated with the transferable image-bearing member and
located adjacent to one side of the sheet travel path for
selectively receiving a transferable image from such member
and transferring such image to one side of a receiver sheet
moving along the sheet travel path. The second doner roller
is operatively associated

A method for forming a first image and a second image on
both sides of a recording paper, respectively, by using an

electrophotographic process, comprising the successive steps of:

generating said first image on a first image holding means
(3a) capable of generating and transferring a developer image;
transferring said first image from said first image holding
means (3a) to a second image holding means (5);
generating said second image on said first image holding
means (3a);
conveying said recording paper in one direction, said first
image holding means (3a) being disposed on one side of the paper conveying plane and said second image holding means (5) being

disposed on the other side of the paper conveying plane where said recording paper is conveyed;
transferring said second image from said first image
holding means (3a) to one side of said recording paper;
fixing said second image on the side of said recording
paper;
transferring said first image from said second image
holding means (5) to the other side of said recording paper; and
fixing said first image on the other side of said recording
paper.
The method as set forth in claim 1, wherein said second 
image holding means (5) comprises a rotatable belt wound around at

least two rollers including two drive rollers (5-a, 5-b).
The method as set forth in claim 2, wherein one of said two
drive rollers (5-a, 5-b) approaches said first image holding means

(3a) only when said first image is transferred from said first image
holding means (3a) to said second image holding means (5), and the

other drive roller approaches said other side of said recording
paper at least when said first image is transferred to said other

side of said recording paper.
An apparatus which is capable of respectively forming
images on both sides of a recording paper by using an

electrophotographic process, comprising:

conveyor means (2) for conveying said recording paper in
one direction;
first image holding means (3a) provided on one side of a
conveying plane of said conveyor means and capable of generating

and transferring a developer image;
