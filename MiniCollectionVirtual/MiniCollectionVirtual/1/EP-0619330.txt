<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the crosslinking of 
polyolefins, particularly, the extrusion of same about an 
electrical conductor or communications medium followed by 
crosslinking. In the extrusion of insulation made from high 
pressure low density polyethylene, organic peroxide compounds 
are commonly mixed with the polyethylene to provide a catalyst 
for crosslinking subsequent to extrusion. It is difficult, if not 
impossible, to find an acceptable extrusion temperature for linear 
polymers (such as those produced in gas phase fluidized reactors) 
as well as highly viscous polymers and compounds under 
production type conditions with conventional peroxides because 
the high extrusion temperatures encountered while extruding 
these materials results in decomposition of the peroxide in the 
extruder leading to premature crosslinking known as scorch. 
This problem also occurs in processes other than extrusion 
processes such as rotomolding, injection molding, and blow 
molding. An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a 
process for crosslinking whereby the decomposition 
temperatures of conventional peroxide catalysts are extended 
upwards a sufficient number of degrees thus essentially avoiding 
decomposition of the peroxides in the extruder and the 
concomitant scorch. Other objects and advantages will become apparent 
hereinafter.  
 According to the present invention, the above object 
is met by a process for crosslinking comprising (a) introducing 
into a reactor, under crosslinking conditions, a composition 
comprising 
(i) one or more polyolefins; (ii) organic peroxide; (iii)ester, ether, or ketone containing two or more unsaturated 
groups; and (iv) a compound having the formula: 
CH2=C(R) -COOR1R2 
wherein 
R = hydrogen, methyl, or ethyl; R1 = an alkylene having 1 to 6 carbon atoms; and R2 = an alkyl having 8 or more carbon atoms or si(R3)3 
wherein R3 is hydrogen or alkoxy having 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms; each R3 is the same or different; and at 
least one R3 is an alkoxy;  
provided that said composition does not essentially consist 
of (i) polyethylene or ethylene-alkylacrylate copolymers 
having a melt index of at least 200; (ii) dicumyl 
peroxide or di-tert-butylether of the dihydroperoxide of 
diisopropyl benzene; (iii) polyfunctional unsaturated 
esters, triallylisocyanurate or triallyl cyanurate in an 
amount of 0.1 to 10 parts per 100 parts of component (i); 
(iv) an alkylacrylate monomer boiling above 150°C and 
soluble in component (i) in an amount of 1 to 20 parts 
per 100
