<ABSTRACT>
To provide an electrophotographic light-receiving 
member having a good initial-stage 

electrophotographic performance and also having a good 
durability especially in an environment of low 

humidity, the light-receiving member comprises a 
support 101, a photoconductive layer 103 formed on the 

support and formed of a non-monocrystalline material 
mainly composed of silicon atoms, and a surface layer 

104 formed of a non-monocrystalline material 
constituted of silicon atoms, carbon atoms, nitrogen 

atoms and hydrogen atoms in which silicon atoms having 
at least one bond to a carbon atom are in a percentage 

of at least 50 atom% based on the whole silicon atoms 
in the surface layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic light-receiving member having a
sensitivity to electromagnetic waves such as light
(which herein refers to light in a broad sense and
indicates ultraviolet rays, visible rays, infrared
rays, X-rays, γ-rays, etc.).In the field of image formation,
photoconductive materials capable of a forming light-receiving
layer in an electrophotographic light-receiving
member are required to have properties such
that they are highly sensitive, have a high SN ratio,
have absorption spectra suited to spectral
characteristics of electromagnetic waves to be
radiated, have a high response to light, have the
desired dark resistance and are harmless to human
bodies when used.Photoconductive materials having good
properties in these respects include amorphous silicon
(hereinafter "A-Si"). For example, U.S. Patent No.
4,265,991 discloses its application in electrophotographic
light-receiving members. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 57-115556
also discloses a technique in which a surface
barrier layer formed of a non-photoconductive
amorphous material containing silicon atoms and carbon
atoms is provided on a photoconductive layer formed of
an amorphous material mainly composed of silicon
atoms, in order to achieve improvements in
photoconductive members having a photoconductive layer
formed of an A-Si deposited film, in respect of their
electrical, optical and photoconductive properties
such as dark resistance, photosensitivity and response
to light and service environmental properties such as
moisture resistance and also in respect of stability
with time.U.S. Patent No. 4,788,120 discloses a
technique in which a surface layer employs an
amorphous material containing silicon atoms, carbon
atom and 41 to 70 atom% of hydrogen atoms as
constituents.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 54-145537
also discloses an electrophotographic image-forming
member comprising a support, an amorphous
silicon photoconductive layer and a surface coat layer
formed of silicon dioxide, silicon nitride or silicon
oxynitride.Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 3-64466 
discloses to form an amorphous silicon film by
glow discharge decomposition of silane gas at applied
voltages with frequencies of 13.56 MHz, 27.12 MHz and
40.68 MHz to produce devices such as photosensitive
drums.These techniques have brought about
improvements in electrical, optical and
photoconductive properties, service environmental
properties and durability of electrophotographic light-receiving
members,
