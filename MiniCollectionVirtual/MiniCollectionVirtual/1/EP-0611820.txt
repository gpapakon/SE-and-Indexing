<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to feeding an inoculant to a reaction 
chamber (37), providing that the inoculant is brought into 

a sealed inoculation vessel (1), in which inoculant 
containers (28) are perforated (by 32,33), whereupon 

drainage (3,4,3') to the reaction chamber takes place, 
while feeding sterile gas under pressure to the inoculation 

vessel and the reaction chamber, provided with a pressure 
gauge system (42,43), in particular when filling the 

reaction chamber with liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of inoculating a liquid,
at which the inoculant placed in one or more closed
containers is brought into a inoculation vessel, the
containers are opened inside the inoculation vessel and the
inoculant from the inoculation vessel is transferred to a
liquid in a reaction chamber, and to an inoculation vessel
and a device for the application of the method.When inoculating a liquid such as milk to prepare yoghurt
or cheese starter for cheese making, or any other bacterial
of fermentation processes, a high degree of hygiene is
generally demanded. Such requirement is not only necessary
because the created product is often a food product or a
food ingredient, or else meant to come into contact with
human beings, so that decay or contamination cannot be
allowed, but also because serious damage may occur when the
liquid does not undergo the desired reaction or
fermentation. In the latter case the liquid tends to be
worthless, as a result of which, besides the loss of the
liquid, additional costs arise in order to discard the
liquid, which may lead, for instance, to a very substantial
pollution tax. Moreover, a thorough cleaning of the
installation concerned, and possibly of the installations
close to it as well, will be required, which not only does
entail expenses but also loss of production.Finally, it is even possible, for instance in this case of
contamination by bacteria or phages, that a new inoculation
stock has to be introduced.Although, as a result of this, much attention is paid to
hygiene when inoculating liquids, it has been an unsolved
problem how to prevent air-borne contaminations.For instance, in practice a number of containers in an
inoculation funnel or vessel are disinfected by means of a 
disinfectant, whereupon such disinfectant is discarded and
the inoculant is carried from the containers towards the
reaction vessel. During this process, however, there is the
possibility that a contamination coming from the
atmosphere may have access to the inoculant.So the French Patent Specification FR-A-361 317 shows an
apparatus in which an ampulla and a weight for breaking the
ampulla are both sterilized by a sterilizing liquid and
rinsed with pure water, after which they fall down in a
guide, the weight above the ampulla, so that the latter
breaks spreading its content, which contains the inoculant.
This is a rather complicated and time consuming process and
has the disadvantage of bringing the ampulla's splinters
into the apparatus.The German Patent Specification

<CLAIMS>
Method of inoculating a liquid, at which the inoculant
placed in one or more closed containers (28) is brought

into an inoculation vessel (1), the containers are opened
inside the inoculation vessel and the inoculant from the

inoculation vessel is transferred to the liquid in a
reaction chamber (37), 
characterized in that
 the
inoculation vessel comes as a sealable inoculation vessel

(1), which, after the containers have been placed inside,
is sealed and, after disinfection, is filled with sterile

gas, whereupon the inoculant is conveyed into the reaction
chamber.
Method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
sterile gas is added under pressure to both the reaction

chamber (37) and the inoculation vessel (1).
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, relating to the
disinfection of the inoculation vessel, 
characterized in
that
 the disinfection of the inoculation vessel takes place
from underneath via a pipe (3) that connects the

inoculation vessel with the reaction chamber, while feeding
and drainage (5) of a disinfectant take place immediately

above a stop-valve (4) located in said pipe.
Inoculation vessel for the application of the method as
claimed in one or more of the claims 1-3, provided with one

or more holding devices (27,29) for the containers (28) and
one or more opening devices that are movable relative to

the holding devices, 
characterized in that
 the inoculation
vessel (1) has one or more air-tight sealable openings (6)

for bringing in full and discarding empty containers (28)

and a mechanism (25) for moving the holding devices and the
opening devices relatively to each other, through an air-tight

sealable wall (24').
Inoculation vessel as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 it has a top connection (23) and a bottom 
connection (3).
Device for applying the method as claimed in one or more
of the claims 1-3 and provided with an inoculation vessel

as claimed in claims 4 and 5, which device contains
furthermore a reaction chamber (37), which has a sealable

connection (3,4,3') with the inoculation vessel,
characterized by
 a source (39) of sterile gas under a
constant overpressure, which by means of a duct and valve

system (49,48,56,57,58,59,60,5,3) is connectable to the
inoculation vessel (1) and the reaction chamber (37), which

source is provided with a gauge (42) in order to open the
air exhaust valve (43) in case of a pressure higher than

said constant overpressure.
Device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that
 a
sterile filter (41), that as a source of sterile gas is

located in a duct of supplied air, is connected through a
valve (49) with the duct and valve system and that the air

exhaust valve (43) is located on that side of the filter
(41) that is not facing the duct and valve system.
Device as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized by
 a feeder
(45) for a disinfectant, which, through one or more valves

(69,58), is connected to a duct (3) at the under side of
the inoculation vessel (1), and a drain (66) for a

disinfectant which, by means of valves (58,57), is
connectable to the duct (3) at the under side of the

inoculation vessel (1).
Device as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized in that
 one
or more valves (57,58) connect to the source (39) of

sterile gas with the duct (23) at the upper side of the
inoculation vessel and valves (58,57) form the connection

for the disinfectant from the duct (3) at the under side of
the inoculation vessel (1) to the drain (66).
Device as claimed in one or more of the claims 6-9,
provided with a feeder (38) and a drain (62) for a 

disinfectant, 
characterized in that
 a there is a device,
reacting on a liquid level (48), which closes the feeder

predetermined level on said device reacting on a liquid

level (48), while there are additional valves or stop-valves
(57,58,4,61) that direct the cleansing agent through

the inoculation vessel and the reaction chamber and from
there ensure its removal.
