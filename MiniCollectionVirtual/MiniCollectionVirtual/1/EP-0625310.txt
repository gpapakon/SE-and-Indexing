<ABSTRACT>
A poultry leg boning apparatus for removing meat from the upper 
and lower leg bones of a poultry leg includes first, a cutting 

machine for cutting open the meat of the poultry leg along one 
side of the upper and lower leg bones, and second, a tendon 

cutting machine for removing the lower leg bone from the poultry 
leg. The tendon cutting machine comprises a rigid annular 

cutting plate (31a), a supporting means (31b) for supporting said cutting 
plate, a first driving means (31d) for rotating said cutting plate and 

a clamping means (32) for clamping the ankle of the poultry leg. A 

second driving (32a) means generates a relative movement between the 
clamping means and the cutting plate. A biasing means (33) is 

provided for biasing the knee joint of the leg against the 
cutting plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a poultry leg boning 
apparatus for removing meat from the poultry legs. When the meat is manually removed from the poultry 
leg, the boning work is carried out with a knife by means 
of the following steps: 
(1) cutting the meat of the leg along the upper and 
lower leg bones; (2) cutting the knee joint so as to separate the 
upper leg bone from the lower leg bone; (3) pulling up the upper leg bone at the lower end 
thereof or the knee joint and plucking off the upper leg 
bone from the leg meat; (4) peeling the meat off the leg along the lower leg 
bone toward the knee joint so as to make the meat connected 
only to the knee joint by meat-to-bone connecting tendon 
tissues; and (5) cutting the meat-to-bone connecting tendon 
tissues so as to remove the lower leg bone from the leg 
meat. The above steps of the manual boning require skill and 
physical stamina so that it has been desirable to automate 
them. Especially in the step (1), there has been the 
problem that, if a force biasing the knife against the 
bones is too large, the knife chips the bones and the chips 
of the bones are left on the meat, which decreases the 
economic value of the meat. Or, if the force biasing the  
 
knife against the bones is too small, the knife comes to be 
detached from the bones and a certain amount of meat is 
left on the bones, which decreases the yield of the meat 
removed from the leg. In the step (5), there has been the 
problem that, it is hard to bias the knife against the knee 
joint stably because the knee joint is round and the meat-to-bone 
connecting tendon tissues are hard, this results in 
a hazard to the operator or may decrease the commercial 
value of the meat because of the rough cut surface. Various types of machines and methods for removing the 
meat from the poultry leg have been proposed. For example, 
U.S. Pat. No. 2,897,536 to Bergstrom et al, dated Aug. 4, 
1959 discloses a machine wherein the leg is passed through 
a space between a pair of rotating rollers so that the meat 
is removed from the leg. U.S. Pat. No. 3,261,054 to Kaplan 
et al, dated July 19, 1966 discloses a machine wherein the 
leg is passed through a space between a pair of stripper 
bars so that the meat is removed from the leg. U.S. Pat. 
No. 3,965,535 to Kaplan et al, dated June 29, 1976 discloses 
a machine wherein the leg is passed through a space between 
a pair of discs rotating with their closely spaced 
peripheral stripping edges in opposition so that the meat is 
removed from the

A tendon cutting machine for removing the lower leg bone 
from a poultry leg, which comprises: 

a rigid annular cutting blade (31a) having an annular 
cutting edge (31a₁) and a side away from the cutting edge 

(31a₁); 
supporting means (31b) for supporting the annular cutting 

blade (31a) rotatably around a central axis (X₃); 
first driving means (31d) for rotating the annular 

cutting blade (31a) around the central axis X₃); 
clamping means (32) for clamping the ankle (S₃) of the 

leg (S),which clamping means (32) is disposed coaxially 
with the central axis (X₃) of the annular cutting blade 

(31a), and apart from the annular cutting blade (31a) 
toward the side away from the cutting edge (31a₁); 

second driving means (32g) for generating a relative 
movement bewteen the clamping means (32) and the annular 

cutting blade (31a) in the direction of the central axis 
(X₃) of the central axis (X₃) of the annular cutting 

blade (31a); and 
biasing means (33) for biasing the knee joint (S₄) of the 

 
leg (S) against the cutting edge of (31a₁) of the annular 

cutting blade (31a). 
A tendon cutting machine of claim 1, wherein said biasing 
means (33) comprises: 

a pair of rods (33a) disposed apart from the annular 
cutting blade (31a) on the side of the cutting edge 

(31a₁) thereof, extending on either side of the central 
axis (X₃) and being inclined relative to the central axis 

(X₃). 
A tendon cutting machine of claim 1 or 2 further having 
means (34,35) for separately collecting the lower leg 

bone and the meat (S₆) removed from the lower leg bone 
(S₁). 
A tendon cutting machine of any one of claims 1 to 3, 
further having 

third driving means (36,37) for reciprocally rotating the 
clamping means (32) around the central axis (x₃) of the 

annular cutting blade (31a). 
A method for removing meat from the lower leg bone of a 
poultry leg, which comprises: 

peeling the meat (S₆) off the lower leg bone (S₁) from 
an ankle (S₃) thereof toward a knee joint (S₄) thereof so 

as to make the meat (S₆) connected only to the knee joint 
(S₄) by meat-to-bone connecting tissues; 

passing the lower leg bone (S₁) through a rigid annular 
cutting blade (31a) which has a cutting edge (31a₁) 

extending along one of the annular side surfaces thereof, 
 

from said one of the annular side surfaces to the other, 
the ankle (S₃) being directed in the direction of the 

movement of the lower leg bone (S₁); 
rotating the annular cutting blade (31a) around a central 

axis (X₃); and 
biasing the knee joint (S₄) against the cutting edge 

(31a₁) of the rotating cutting blade (31a₁). 
A method of claim 5, further comprising the step of: 
clamping the lower leg bone (S₁) with a pair of rods 

(33a) disposed adjacent to the cutting edge (31a₁) of the 
annular cutting blade (31a), extending on either side of 

and inclined relative to the central axis (X₃) of the 
annular cutting blade (31a), thereby biasing the knee 

joint (S₄) against the cutting edge (31a) of the rotating 
cutting blade (31a). 
A method of claim 5 or 6 further comprising the step of:
