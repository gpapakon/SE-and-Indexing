<ABSTRACT>
A laser marking device for describing geometric 
forms such as characters and symbols including at least one 

line element on a surface that is being irradiated with 
laser light for two-dimensional scanning, comprises: a 

laser source; scanning optics for allowing the laser light 
from the laser source to be deflected two-dimensionally; 

and a control system for controlling both the ON/OFF 
operation of the laser source and the deflecting operation 

of the scanning optics. The control system includes ROM 
which stores graphic data on the line elements, CPU which 

retrieves the graphic data from ROM and constructs a 
command for graphic description, GDC which receives the 

command and constructs both coordinate data on a plurality 
of points of locus and laser ON/OFF data, and line memory 

which, in response to a WRITE command from GDC, receives 
the coordinate data and laser ON/OFF data while outputting 

the former to the scanning optics and the latter to laser 
source at a given speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser marking
device for describing geometric forms or figures on a
surface that is being irradiated with laser light for two-dimensional
scanning.Laser marking devices are known that apply laser
light onto the surface of an object so that it is worked
for the description of geometric figures and characters.
An example of such laser marking device is shown in Fig. 5
and it comprises a CO2 laser 28 as a laser source, an X-axis
scanner 26 and a Y-axis scanner 27 allowing the laser light
form the CO2 laser 28 to be deflected two-dimensionally, and
a computer system 20 for controlling both the ON/OFF
operation of the CO2 laser 28 and the deflecting operation
of the two scanners 26 and 27.A CPU 21 in the computer system 20 executes the
computer program stored in a ROM 22 and constructs
coordinate data to be supplied to the X-axis scanner 26 and
the Y-axis scanner 27, as well as a laser ON/OFF control
signal to be supplied to the CO2 laser 28.One way to construct the coordinate data is 
described below with reference to an exemplary case of
describing a geometric form that comprises a straight line
element A-B and a circular arc line element B-C as shown in
Fig. 6. A circle is dealt with as a special case of an
ellipse where its major and minor axes coincide with each
other. ROM 22 registers not only the coordinates (X1, Y1)
for the start point of line element A-B, (X2, Y2) for the
end point of line element A-B or for the start point of
line element B-C, (X3, Y3) for the end point of line element
B-C, the coordinates (X4, Y4) for the center of the ellipse
and R as the length of the major axis or minor axis of the
ellipse, but also the kind of the line of which each line
element is a part (i.e., whether it is a straight line, an
ellipse or the like). Coordinate data on a number of
points of locus on the straight line or the arc of a circle
that connect the start and end points of each line element
are to be computed by software-based arithmetic operations.Another way to construct the coordinate data is
to compute preliminarily the coordinate data on a number of
points of locus that constitute each line element, register
them in a memory like ROM 22, and retrieve them from the
memory when describing a geometric form.However, the conventional laser marking devices
have had the following problems.The first problem concerns the computation of 
coordinate data. The first of the two methods described
above has had the disadvantage of taking unduly long time
in performing
