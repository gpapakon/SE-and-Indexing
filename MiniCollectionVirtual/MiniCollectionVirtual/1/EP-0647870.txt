<ABSTRACT>
A polymer dispersed liquid crystal display device 
includes an active element substrate (11) on which 

active elements (14) and pixel electrodes (13) are 
arranged in the form of a matrix, a counter substrate 

(12) having a counter electrode (20) formed on a 
surface, of the counter substrate (12), opposing the 

active element substrate (11), and a polymer dispersed 
liquid crystal film (30) arranged between the active 

element substrate (11) and the counter substrate (12) 
and formed by dispersing a polymer resin (31) and a 

cholesteric liquid crystal (32). The cholesteric 
liquid crystal (32) is in a randomly aligned state to 

be twisted at a specific helical pitch in the absence of 
an electric field. When an electric field is applied 

across the pixel electrodes (13) and the counter electrode 
(20), the cholesteric liquid crystal (32) is 

aligned along the electric field, and the polymer 
dispersed liquid crystal film (30) is set in a light-transmitting 

state, thereby setting a display in a 
bright state. When the application of the electric 

field is stopped, the cholesteric liquid crystal (32) 
is restored, within a short time, to a randomly 

twisted/aligned state by the restoring force of the 
cholesteric liquid crystal (32), and the polymer 

dispersed liquid crystal film (30) is set in a light-scattering 

state, thereby setting a display in a dark 
state. When a dichroic dye is added to the cholesteric 

liquid crystal (32), the dark display becomes dark, 
thereby increasing the contrast of an image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to an active matrix polymer dispersed liquid crystal display device
as set forth in the preamble of claim 1. A liquid crystal display device of this kind is
known from JP-A-05 088 150.The aforementioned document discloses a polymer dispersed liquid crystal display
device comprising a cholesteric liquid crystal. From JP-A-04 119 320, a polymer
dispersed liquid crystal display device is known comprising a liquid crystal composite
which consists of a chiral nematic or cholesteric liquid crystal and a transparent
synthetic resin matrix in a three-dimensional mesh shape. The helical pitch of the
liquid crystal does not exceed half of the mesh size of the transparent synthetic resin
matrix.From WO 92/14181 a liquid crystal display device is known comprising a polymer
dispersed liquid crystal layer containing encapsulated liquid crystal, and a TFT matrix.
The periodical "Feinwerktechnik & Messtechnik", volume 98, number 1/2, 1990, pages
17 to 19 discloses a liquid crystal display device comprising a polymer dispersed
liquid crystal layer containing encapsulated liquid crystal, fluorescent material and a
reflective material. From JP-A-5 241 135 a polymer dispersed liquid crystal display
device is known, which includes a reflective plate having a fluorescent material,
outside a pair of substrates, where a polymer dispersed liquid crystal layer is
sandwiched. As a liquid crystal display device, a polymer dispersed
liquid crystal display device has received a good
deal of attention. A polymer dispersed liquid crystal
display device is constituted by: a pair of substrates
respectively having electrodes formed thereon; and a
polymer dispersed liquid crystal film (a composite film
consisting of a polymer resin and a liquid crystal)
arranged between the pair of substrates and having a
structure in which the polymer resin and the liquid
crystal are dispersed.As a liquid crystal constituting a polymer dispersed
liquid crystal film, a nematic liquid crystal
having positive dielectric anisotropy is used.FIGS. 11A and 11B are enlarged sectional views
respectively showing portions of the polymer dispersed
liquid crystal film of a polymer dispersed liquid
crystal display device. The polymer dispersed liquid
crystal film shown in FIGS. 11A and 11B has a structure
in which a nematic liquid crystal 102 is confined in
spaces of a polymer resin 101 having a mesh-like
sectional structure. When no voltage is applied across the electrodes
of both the substrates, an electric field is not applied
to the polymer
