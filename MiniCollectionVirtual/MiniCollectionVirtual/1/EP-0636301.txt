<ABSTRACT>
A layered coder includes a lower resolution predictive encoder (102) and a higher resolution encoder (402) providing coded low and high resolution signals at lines (110) and (218) respectively. The prediction error of the lower resolution predictive encoder (102) is provided as a prediction error estimate to the higher resolution encoder (402), the prediction error estimate being subtracted from the prediction error generated in the higher resolution predictive encoder (402) by the subtractor (210). This difference from the subtractor (404) is coded by the coder (212) whose output is made available on the line (218). The prediction error estimate from the up sampler (130) is added to the output from the decoder (220) by an adder (406) in order to complete the predictive loop of the higher resolution predictive encoder (402). The prediction error estimate can also be subtracted from the prediction error of the higher resolution predictive encoder in the transform domain. The layered coder makes available both higher and lower resolution coded signals, with good coding efficiency as the coding information obtained from the lower resolution encoder (102) is used in the coding carried out by the higher resolution predictive encoder (402).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to layered video coders for
coding a series of video signals and in particular to a
coder comprising a lower resolution coder and a higher
resolution coder. These two coding layers may be part of
a multi-layered coder having two or more layers of coder.There is a general requirement for coders which can
provide outputs which allow decoding at a receiver
selectively at least two different coding schemes. For
example, a coder could transmit signals which could be
decoded to provide lower or higher resolution depending on
the receiving equipment. This principal is extendable to
multi-layered coders.One known way of configuring such a hybrid, or
compatible, layered coder is shown at Figure 1 in which a
base layer is coded at a lower resolution with the higher
resolution differences being coded by a second coder to
form an enhancement layer which codes the differences
(error signals) between the decoded base layer and the
input signals. A receiving decoder can either decode the
base layer alone to provide a lower resolution picture or
obtain a higher resolution picture by further decoding the
enhancement layer and adding that to the decoded base layer
signals.In such prior art coding schemes the enhancement layer
coder does not carry out any predictive coding on the error
signal between the base layer coded signal and the input
signal.Where the higher resolution coding scheme is to
operate at high bit rates, for example 5 to 10Mbit/s, the
amount of overhead data associated with predictive coding
using motion vectors, for example, is very small relative
to the coded data. In these cases the picture quality is
optimised by providing such predictions and efficiently
coding the prediction error of the predictive coder. One known approach to a hybrid coder in which the higher resolution
coder utilizes predictive coding is shown at Figure 2. This decoder formed part of
a submission by the Applicant, in November 1991, to the ITU MPEG-standard
committe which was entitled "COSMIC Algorithm Proposal". In order to utilise the
output of the lower resolution coder, the decoded output of the lower resolution
coder is used as a estimate of the signal to be encoded by the higher resolution
coder. This estimate is used in preference to the estimate provided by the higher
resolution coder when it provides a better estimate.In practice it has been found that if the incoming video signals to be
encoded is an intraframe then the coded signal provided by the lower resolution
coder does provide an estimate
