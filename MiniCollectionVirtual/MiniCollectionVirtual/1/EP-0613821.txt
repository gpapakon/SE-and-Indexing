<ABSTRACT>
For a strapping machine, a mechanism is disclosed 
for mounting a movable chute to a fixed wall (12) and for 

biasing the chute toward the wall while permitting the 
chute to move away from the wall so as to allow a strap 

to be pulled from the chute. The mechanism comprises a 
wall-mounted bracket (20), a chute-mounted bracket (22), and a 

pivot arm (24) having an end portion (28) connected pivotally to 
the wall-mounted bracket, an end portion (32) connected 

pivotally to the chute-mounted bracket, and an 
intermediate portion, to which a coiled spring (26) is 

connected at one end so as to bias the chute toward the 
wall but so as to permit the chute to move away from 

the wall. The coiled spring is connected at its other 
end to the first bracket and extends between the 

brackets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains generally to a chute 
system for a strapping machine of a type used to apply 
a polymeric or metal strap around a load. This 
invention pertains particularly to a mechanism for 
mounting a movable chute to a fixed wall, in the chute 
system, and for biasing the chute toward the wall while 
permitting the chute to move away from the wall so as 
to allow a strap to be pulled from the chute. The 
mechanism, which employs a pivotal action, provides 
essentially frictionless motion and is not prone to 
binding due to accumulation of dust or other debris. In a strapping machine of the type noted above, it 
is common to employ a chute system including a fixed 
wall and a movable chute, each in an arched 
configuration. The arched configurations enable the 
wall and the chute to surround a load being strapped, 
except where a strapping head is disposed below the 
load. Typically, the chute has a generally U-shaped 
cross-section defining a bight and two generally 
parallel flanges with a space between the flanges to 
accommodate a strap being fed along the chute. The 
chute is movable toward and away from a closed position 
wherein the flanges bear against the fixed wall. The 
chute is biased toward the closed position. Means may be provided, such as solenoid-actuated 
means, for moving a portion of the chute away from the 
fixed wall when it is desired to pull a strap from the 
space between the flanges. Commonly, the portion of 
the chute that is moved is near the strapping head, 
below the load. It is known, however, to employ a  
 
chute system comprising such a wall and such a chute 
without such means for moving a portion of the chute. In a commonly used arrangement, the chute is mounted to 
the wall by a series of similar clips spaced along the 
chute, each clip being mounted movably on a post 
projecting from the wall and each clip being biased by a 
coiled spring toward the wall. Moreover, the coiled spring 
is disposed around the post, within a bore of such clip. 
Such an arangement is used in Models SP-300/330 Automatic 
and Semi-Automatic Strapping Machines available 
commercially from Signode Packaging Systems (a unit of 
Illinois Tool Works Inc.) of Glenview, Illinois, and is 
illustrated on pages 6-39, 6-40, of Section 6 (dated June 
1992) of the Operation, Parts and Safety Manual for those 
Models. Although such an arrangement has been regarded as 
generally satisfactory, it has been noted to have some 
shortcomings. Dust or other debris tends to accumulate in 
the bores,

<CLAIMS>
Chute system for a strapping machine, the chute system 
comprising a fixed wall (12) and a movable chute (14), the 

chute (14) having a generally U-shaped cross-section 
defining a bight (16) and two generally parallel flanges 

(18) with a space between the flanges (18) to accommodate 
a strap (S) being fed along the chute (14), the chute (14) 

being movable toward and away from a closed position 
wherein the flanges (18) bear against the wall (12), 


characterized in
 that the chute system 
comprises a mechanism (10) for mounting the chute (14) to 

the wall (12) and for biasing the chute (14) toward the 
wall (12) while permitting the chute (14) to move away 

from the wall (12) so as to allow a strap (S) to be pulled 
from the chute (14), the mechanism (10) comprising a first 

bracket (20) mounted fixedly to the wall (12), a second 
bracket (22) movable conjointly with the chute (14), and a 

pivot arm (24) having a first end portion (28) connected 
pivotally to the first bracket (20), a second end portion 

(32) connected pivotally to the second bracket (22), and 
an intermediate portion (36), the me
chanism (10) further 
comprising means for biasing the pivot arm (24) so as to 

bias the chute (14) toward the wall (12) but so as to 
permit the chute (14) to move away from the wall (12).  

 
Chute system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the biasing means comprises a coiled spring (26) 

connected to the intermediate portion (36) of the pivot 
arm (24). 
Chute system according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the coiled spring (26) has two opposite ends (42, 

44), namely an end (42) connected to the intermediate 
portion (36) of the pivot arm (24) and an end (44) 

connected to the first bracket (20). 
Chute system according to claim 3, characterized in 
that the coiled spring (26) extends from the end (42) 

connected to the intermediate portion (36) of the pivot 
pin (24), between the first and second brackets (20, 22), 

to the end (44) connected to the first bracket (20).
