<ABSTRACT>
A new type of composite electrooptical material based on liquid crystal, dispersed in a polymer which has reactive functional groups (Y). The novelty lies in the chemical modification of the polymer/liquid crystal interface resulting in the formation of a composite including a porous polymer lattice, liquid crystal molecules in the pores of the lattice, the polymer having reactive functional groups (Y) and functional groups (X) at the polymer/liquid crystal interface. The combination of (Y) functional groups and (X) functional groups makes it possible to optimise the electrooptical performance obtained from material of this type. The invention also relates to a process for obtaining this composite material and to a device including such a material.
