<ABSTRACT>
Self-adhesive label for labelling cylindrical or prismatic, preferably medical containers, having at least one detachable edge section 2, which is intended for reproducing the information contained on the self-adhesive label 1 at another location. The edge section is underlaid with a film of smooth coating, which prevents permanent adhesive bonding of the edge section with its substrate, so that the edge section can be detached as and when desired. The self-adhesive label is simple to produce and can be printed over its entire surface virtually with any desired printing device.

<CLAIMS>
Self-adhesive label (11) with a self-adhesive upper 
material sheet (1), which has a separable edge section 

(2), and with a smooth layer film (3), which is arranged 
on the adhesive layer (4) of the upper material sheet (1) 

in the region of the end section (2), to prevent a 
permanent adhesive connection between the separable edge 

section (2) and its support after applying the label to 
an article, characterised in that the smooth layer film 

(3) is transparent. 
Self-adhesive label as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the smooth layer film (3) has a 

self-adhesive layer (5). 
Self-adhesive label as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that it is so provided for the purpose 

of winding around the article that the edge section (2) 
of the self-adhesive label overlaps the initial section 

of the self-adhesive label and the smooth layer film (3) 
is firmly connected to the upper material sheet (1) in 

the region of the initial section of the self-adhesive 
label. 
Self-adhesive label as claimed in one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the smooth layer film (3) is a 

silicone film. 
Self-adhesive label as claimed in one of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the edge section (2) is divided 

off by a perforation (6). 
Self-adhesive label as claimed in one of claims 1 to  
 

5, characterised in that the edge section (2) has at 
least one grasping lug (9,10). 
Self-adhesive label as claimed in one of claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the edge section (2) is divided 

into at least two portions (2a,2b) by a stamped region 
(7).
