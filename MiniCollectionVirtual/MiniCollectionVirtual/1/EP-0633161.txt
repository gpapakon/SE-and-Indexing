<ABSTRACT>
The padding according to the invention comprises a block of foam, the bearing face of which has an opening (8) closed by a bottom (9) towards the opposite face, and lined with an insert (12) of an air- and/or moisture-permeable material. The opening (8) is located between two lining pull-back grooves (6) defining two reentrant lines in the cover enveloping the padding and which are symmetric relative to the vertical mid-plane of the padding. The opening (8) is separated from the grooves (6) by respectively two rims (11) and a firm foam. Application to seat padding, particularly for motor vehicle seat backrests.

Seat padding, comprising a foam block having, 
recessed in its support face, a recess (8) closed by a 

base (9) towards the opposite face of the padding, the 
said recess (8) being filled with an insert (12) consisting 

of a material which is more permeable to air and/or 
to moisture than the foam constituting the block, characterized 

in that, with the support face comprising at 
least two lining return grooves (6) capable of defining 

two re-entrant lines in the cover surrounding the 
padding, which lines are symmetrical or substantially 

symmetrical to each other with respect to a longitudinal 
vertical mid-plane of the padding, the recess (8) is 

arranged between these two grooves (6) and separated from 
them by two respective narrow shoulders (11) made of a 

hard foam. 
Padding according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that it comprises a third shoulder (11), transversely 

joining the two shoulders (11) so as to form with them an 
open U-shaped frame (10), and a third return groove (7), 

adjacent to the frame (10) outside the latter and along 
the third shoulder (11) which is also made of hard foam. 
Padding according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the two shoulders belong to one and the same closed 

frame (10a, 10b) which is adjacent to another return 
groove (7a, 7b) outside the frame and along at least a 

part (11a, 11b) of the frame which is also made of hard 
foam. 
Padding according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises several transverse 

recesses filled with inserts (12a, 12b, 12c) and 
each extending between the two return grooves (6). 
Padding according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the insert (12) and/or the 

base (9) of the corresponding recess (8) has or have a 
variable thickness in at least one transverse or 

longitudinal direction of the padding. 
Padding according to any one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the insert (12) has, at 
least locally, an overthickness (13) of the permeable 

material which projects over the support face of the 
padding with respect to the above shoulders (11), before 

lining the padding with a cover. 
Padding according to any one of the preceding 

claims, characterized in that the base (9) of the recess 
(8) has at least one blind opening (15, 16) opening 

towards the support face or the opposite face of the 
padding, and/or at least one opening (14) emerging in 

these two faces. 
Padding according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the side parts (2) of the 

block of foam which are separated from the two shoulders 
(11) by the two return grooves (6) and/or the base (9) of 

the recess (8) are made of a foam at least substantially 
as hard as that of the shoulders (11). 
Padding according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the insert (12), prefabricated, 

for example by thermoforming, is added on and 
fastened in the corresponding recess (8) made in a block 

of foam moulded in a single piece, including the 
shoulders. 
Padding according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the insert (12), the foam base (9) 

of the corresponding recess (8) and the corresponding 
foam shoulders (11) constitute a panel added on in the 

block of foam and fastened to this block.
