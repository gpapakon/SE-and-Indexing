<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device (10) are proposed for the regeneration of voltage sources (11) in the form of primary cells (primary elements), by means of electrical energy which is supplied in the form of a DC voltage. In this case, the voltage source (11) which is to be regenerated has applied to it over a predetermined time interval voltage pulses (18) which are applied essentially cyclically, have an amplitude which can be predetermined and have a pulse length which can be predetermined. The DC voltage signal (13) required for this purpose is supplied from a low-resistance DC voltage source (23). The voltage pulse sequence (18), which is applied to one pole (19) of the voltage source (11) which is to be regenerated, is produced in a pulsed switching device (14) by means of a pulse generator (clock generator) (15).

Method for regenerating voltage sources in the form of primary cells by means of an
electrical energy supply in the form of voltage pulses, characterized in that essentially

periodic voltage pulses of predetermined fixed amplitude and predetermined fixed pulse
length are applied during a predetermined interval of time to the voltage source which

Method according to Claim 4, characterized in that the regeneration current can be
adjusted and/or regulated as a function of the internal resistance of the voltage source to

be regenerated.
Appliance for regenerating voltage sources in the form of primary cells by means of electrical
energy supplied to carry out the method in accordance with one or more of

Claims 1 to 5, characterized by a low-resistance DC voltage source (23) whose DC
voltage signal (13) is fed to a cycled switching device (14) cycled by a cycle generator

take place in a predetermined time interval, whereby the output (16) of the switching

device (14), which output (16) supplies a voltage pulse sequence (18) of fixed amplitude,
short rise time and predetermined fixed pulse length, can be connected to one pole

(19) of the voltage source (11) for the regeneration of the latter.
Appliance according to Claim 6, characterized in that the switching device (14) has a
regulating device for regulating the regeneration current. 
Appliance according to Claim 7, characterized in that the regulation characteristic of the
regulation device is adjusted in accordance with the internal resistance, which varies as a

function of the degree of regeneration of the voltage source (11).
Appliance according to one or more of Claims 6 to 8, characterized in that the regeneration
time interval of the voltage source (11) can be set by means of a time element (22)

which can adjust the time interval.
