<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a prophylactic and/or 
therapeutic agent for allergic diseases wherein 
immunoglobulin E antibody (hereinafter referred to as IgE 
antibody) is involved, for example, some types of bronchial 
asthma, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, dermatis, and 
hypersensitivity. Allergic reactions involved in allergic diseases, for 
example, some types of bronchial asthma, conjunctivitis, 
rhinitis, dermatis, and hypersensitivity are caused by the 
release of various chemical mediators such as histamine, 
prostaglandin, leukotriene, thromboxane, and platelet 
activating factor from mast cells or basophils upon binding 
of the particular antigen with IgE antibody on the surface 
of such cells. Various symptoms are induced by such 
allergic reactions, and nosotropic therapies are most 
commonly employed to relieve such symptoms. Etiotropic 
therapies are also popular that employ compounds such as 
sodium cromoglicate, tranilast, ketotifen, and azelastine, 
that are capable of inhibiting the release of chemical 
mediators among the series of allergic reactions. However,  
 
compounds that are capable of blocking the stage of 
reactions preceding the release of chemical mediators are 
scarcely known, and the development of such compounds 
useful for pharmaceutical composition is sincerely awaited. 
In view of such conditions, a compound capable of 
inhibiting the production of IgE antibody, that is 
responsible for various allergic diseases as mentioned 
above, would be highly useful as a therapeutic agent to 
enable the more etiotropic treatment of such diseases. Prior arts relating to the compound of the present 
invention are hereinafter described. USP 3,200,123 discloses 2-substituted-5,6-dihydroimidazo[ij]quinoline 
derivatives having an 
inflammatory activity without any pharmacological data. 
Intensity and detailed mechanism of such activity of the 
individual compound are unknown. In Journal of Organic 
Chemistry, 25, 1138-1147, 1960, the inventors of the USP 
3,200,123 reported that only some compounds among the 
above-mentioned dihydroimidazo[ij]quinoline derivatives 
proved effective in animals with dextran sulfate-induced 
edema. Both prior art documents fail to indicate anti-allergic 
activities, in particular, the activity to 
suppress IgE antibody production. Some 1-substituted-8,9-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinoline 
derivatives are reported in Bulletin of the 
Chemical Society of Japan, 61, 423-429, 1988. These 
compounds are intermediate products in the synthesis of
