<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing supportless and release agent free, thermally activable nonwovens based on hydroxyl polyester polyurethanes having viscosities from 600 to 3500 mPa.s, measured as solution viscosity in methyl ethyl ketone (15% strength, Brookfield LVT viscometer, spindle 3, 60 rpm, 23@C), and having basis weights within the range from 5 to 200 mg/m

, which is characterised in that the nonwovens are formed by means of a melt-blowing process at melt temperatures from 230 to 260@C using a laydown belt whose material has a surface tension from 18.5 x 10

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of heat-activatable
nonwovens comprising neither backing nor release agent

and based on hydroxyl polyester polyurethanes having
viscosities of 600 to 3500 mPa·s, measured as solution

viscosity in methyl ethyl ketone (15%, Brookfield LVT
viscosimeter, spindle 3, 60 rpm, 23°C), and having

weights per unit area in the range from 5 to 200 g/m
2
,
characterised in that the nonwovens are produced by

means of a melt-blowing process (for example the
Reicofil® melt-blowing process) at melt temperatures

of 230 to 260°C, wherein a laydown belt is used, the
material of which has a surface tension of 18.5 × 10
