<ABSTRACT>
Customary recorders record data packets whose format is adapted to the data format of the recorder. If, however, the data packets have a different format, various difficulties arise, for example with error protection. In such cases, there is therefore also no search mode within at least partial evaluation of data packets. According to the invention, before the recording/storage, the data packets are consequently arranged "transversely" in a way corresponding to Fig. 1, i.e. it is not the case that every data packet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is recorded/stored continuously (in the vertical direction in Fig. 1), but that the first section (a) of the data packets is continuously recorded (in the horizontal direction in Fig. 1). Subsequently, the further sections of these data packets are recorded. However, during the fast search of a digital recorder, the helical tracks can be read only section by section. Only rudiments of the data packets (1...5) would be sensed and these cannot be decoded meaningfully for reproduction. Thus, additional data packets (A1, A2, B1, B2), which may also in some cases be copies of the data already recorded in the "normal" way, are recorded in reserve sections which can be read coherently in a search. During the search at increased speed, these reserve sync blocks are then evaluated.

A method of storing or playing back data packets - in
particular in a digital video- or data recorder -

characterised in that

the length (LD) of the data packets to be stored is
greater than the length (LR) available for a sequential

storage/playback of data packets;
a group (a, b, c, ..., n) of data packets (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
to be stored is in each case formed, within which group

corresponding, small sections of the individual data packets
are in each case sequentially stored/read, commencing with

the first section (a) for each data packet, so that the
sections of each individual one of the data packets appear

in the data stream at regular intervals;
each corresponding group of identically positioned
sections is allocated an error protection (FEC) assigned to

the storage/playback;
the sections with error protection (FECD, 1', 2', 3', 4',
5') assigned to the data packets are recorded/played back

without the insertion of useful data (D) of the data
packets.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that
additionally data packets (Al, A2; B1, B2) readable in a

search run are stored/read, which data packets are arranged
sequentially in continuous fashion.
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in that
the data packets readable in the search run are copies of

individual ones of the other data packets. 
A method according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in
that in a two-dimensional display (Figure 1) the data

packets (Al, A2; B1, B2) readable in the search run are
arranged next to the other data packets (1 ... 5) with error

protection (1' ... 5') or, as low-level modulation, below
these data
 packets.
A method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the error protection (FEC) assigned to

the storage/playback and the error protection (FECD, 1', 2',
3', 4', 5') assigned to the data packets is fully utilized.
A method according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that a group (a, b, c, ..., n) of data

packets (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to be stored and, if present, the
associated data packets (A1, A2; B1, B2) readable in a

search run are in each case arranged in an oblique track of
a recorder.
A method according to one or more of Claims 2 to 6,
characterised in that a code for television pictures with TV

definition is contained in the data packets (A1, A2; B1, B2)
readable in the search run and substantially a code for

television pictures with HDTV definition is contained in the
other data packets (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
