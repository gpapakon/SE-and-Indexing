<ABSTRACT>
The method involves providing a thermosetting powdered or granulated paint material (23a) which is heated to a plastic condition to form a plastics coating material (23) and injected into a mould. A thermoplastic substrate material (24) is then injected to spread the material (23) over surfaces of the mould so as to envelope the material (24). A moulding (11) is then produced comprising a substrate having a surface coated by the injected plastics paint material. The method enables a moulding to be produced having a painted surface produced in the mould thereby avoiding the need to apply a subsequent paint finish.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of forming a
moulding by dual injection and a moulding formed in
accordance with such a method. In particular, but
not exclusively, the invention is concerned with the
moulding of a vehicle body component in a way which
will avoid having to apply a coating of paint to a
pre-formed component.Dual injection moulding is a technique involving
injecting a first plastics material into a mould
followed by a second plastics material. The
injection steps causes the first material to coat the
mould surfaces and the second material forms a
substrate for the first. The component so formed may
harden in the mould prior to removal from the mould.An example of dual injection moulding is disclosed in
GB-A-1,420,948. However any moulding produced by
such a method will require subsequent painting
outside the mould.Another example of dual injection moulding is
disclosed in GB-A-2 080 187 which describes a method
of resin injection moulding (RIM) where a low
viscosity liquid resin, for example liquid paint, is
injected at low pressure (eg 7 bar) into a mould 
followed by a higher viscosity liquid resin. The low
viscosity liquid resin forms a coating for the higher
viscosity resin. Such low viscosity paints take the
form of a liquid thermosetting resin having coloured
pigments which is injected in its uncured liquid form
and subsequently cured. A disadvantage of using a
low viscosity liquid resin is that of controlling
accurately the spread of the liquid paint to produce
a coating of uniform thickness. Therefore such a
process is suitable only for the production of primer
coats which have to be finished by applying a coat
of paint in a conventional manner outside the mould,
eg by paint spraying.An increasing number of motor vehicles are now
provided with components such as body panels made
from plastics materials. For example it has been
proposed to form a vehicle body component by
initially injecting an unfilled thermoplastics
material followed by a glass filled polymer material
as a substrate. The unfilled plastics material
thereby forms a smooth coating on the substrate ready
to receive paint which is subsequently applied by
spraying or dipping the cured moulding in a paint
facility. We are unaware of any vehicle component
being made by such a process which does not
subsequently require a finishing paint coating
applied outside the mould and the motor industry 
continues to refine its painting facilities, which in
themselves can involve large capital investment and
on-going maintenance

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a painted moulding, comprising
injecting a plastics coating material (23) into a mould

(10) and injecting a plastics substrate material (24)
into the mould by dual injection to cause the coating

material to coat a surface of the mould and to produce a
moulding (11) having a coating formed by the plastics

coating material (23), characterised by providing the
coating material (23) as a powdered or granulated cross-linking

plastics paint material (23a) and heating the
powdered or granulated plastics paint material to a

plastic condition for injection into the mould.
A method according to Claim 1 characterised by
providing the powdered or granulated plastics paint

material (23a) as a thermosetting material having a
thermoplastic phase and heating the thermosetting

powdered or granulated plastics paint material to bring
it to a plastic condition for injection into the mould.
A method according to Claim 2 characterised by heating
the powdered plastics paint material (23a) to around 80°

to 260°C to bring it to a plastic condition for injection
into the mould (10). 
A method according to Claim 2 or 3 characterised by
allowing the heat absorbed by the powdered or granulated

plastics paint material (23a) to bring it into a plastic 
condition for injection also to cause the plastics

coating material (23) to begin thermosetting during the
moulding process.
A method according to Claim 2 or 3 characterised by
curing the coating (23) formed by the heated powdered or

granulated plastics paint material (23a) after removing

surface of the moulding (11) so as to cure the plastics
coating material (23) without the applied heat (14a)

having any substantial softening effect on the substrate.
A method according to any preceding Claim
characterised by providing a said powdered or granulated

plastics paint material (23a) as one which has some
affinity to the substrate material.
A method according to any preceding Claim
characterised by effecting cross-linking between the
