<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a butting assembly as set 
forth in the preamble of claim 1. The invention concerns also a 
butting method which employs such butting assembly. The bar butting assembly according to the invention is 
applied advantageously in cooperation with, and upstream of, 
machines fed with a bar or a bundle of bars, such as bending 
machines or machines to shear bars into segments of a pre-set 
length, for instance. The machines have the purpose of producing accurately bent 
stirrups and bars and especially stirrups and bent bars for 
building work; the machines are therefore especially 
suitable for processing round bars for building work with a 
smooth outer surface or with ridges to accentuate fixture in 
concrete. Various types of assembly to butt bars are disclosed in 
the state of the art. FR-A-2.472.523 discloses a bending machine which includes 
butting and lengthwise feeding means consisting of a thrust 
block, which is thrust against the trailing end of a bundle 
of bars so as to make the leading end of the bars cooperate 
with an abutment stop. This machine does not ensure a correct butting of the bars 
inasmuch as it causes the trailing ends of a bundle of bars 
to be aligned but, owing to the length of the bars not being 
always constant but being affected by the tolerances of the 
operation of shearing the bars to size, does not ensure a 
correct butting of the leading ends of the bars. FR-A-2.340.152 discloses a device to feed bars lengthwise, 
whereby the butting is performed by engaging the bar and 
feeding it lengthwise, by a winch for instance, until the 
leading end of the bar has been brought into contact with an  
 
abutment plate suitably arranged beforehand in the required 
position. This system requires that the feeding means 
should pre-arrange the bars one by one in the shearing 
position and should therefore have a considerable travel, 
which will vary according to the length of the bars to be 
produced. EP-A-0.188.850, 
on which the preamble of claim 1 is based, 
arranges that a bundle of unbutted bars 
clamped by longitudinally movable gripper means is fed 
forwards until it cooperates with an abutment plate actuated 
by a piston; this plate has a first advanced position and a 
second retracted position. The leading end of the bar in 
its advanced position cooperates with the abutment plate and 
displaces the plate from its first advanced position to its 
second retracted position. The gripper is then opened to free the bundle and retreats 
to its starting
