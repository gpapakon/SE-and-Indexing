<ABSTRACT>
A printed circuit board connector has: an insulating 
housing (2); SMT type contacts (7, 11) disposed in the 

insulating housing and spaced apart from each other; and 
each contact having a lead (11) which extends to a junction 

surface (2a) of the housing so as to be soldered to 
a conductive pattern (16) formed on a printed circuit 

board (15). The lead (11) of each contact is a plating 
layer (10) formed on the junction surface (2a). The 

contacts (7) are pin contacts held in place by the insulating 
housing (2) so as to be electrically connected to 

the plating layer (10) formed as the leads. The contacts' 
leads are included in a common plane so that the 

reliability of electric connection and the durability of 
connector are improved, and the connector is rendered 

thinner and more compact to reduce an area required to 
mount it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printed circuit 
board connector which, in the preferred embodiment, is 
designed to be thinner and to require a smaller area when 
surface-mounled on a printed circuit board. Each connector of this type generally comprises a 
plurality of contacts embedded in an insulating housing and 
each having 4 lead protruding therefrom. When such a 
connector is surface-mounted on the circuit board, the 
leads are aligned with a conductive printed pattern of the 
circuit board before soldered thereto by the re-flow 
technique. Therefore, all the leads have to be arranged 
such that their solderable portions are included in a 
common plane, to assure a coplanarity. In manufacture of the contacts, a raw material is 
subjected to the pressing, bending, cutting and the like 
steps. Those steps have been causing more or less a 
residual stress in the leads of said contacts, giving rise 
to a fluttering and/or battering of the leads and thus 
failing to afford the coplanarity. Such an unevenness 
among the manufactured leads has been resulting in an 
imperfect soldering and/or short circuit problem that 
impair the reliability of electrical connection and  
 
durability of the connectors. This problem is serious 
especially in the surface-mountable connectors each having 
a number of the leads of high density and arranged at fine 
regular intervals. Another problem inherent in the prior art connectors 
is that the leads protrude sideways to the right and left 
a considerable distance, thereby requiring a large area to 
mount each connector. European Patent Specification No. 0,430,267 discloses 
a molded connector comprising a dielectric housing within 
which an abutment member is provided. The abutment member 
grips and electrically connects with inserted into the 
mouth of the housing. The abutment member is connected to 
a terminal extending from the rear of the housing. Japanese Patent Publication No. 1,189,151 (Application 
No. 880012643) discloses a surface mounted PCB component 
wherein the legs of the component have been provided with 
irregularities so that the adhesion of the leg to solder is 
improved. United States Patent No. 4,695,106 discloses a surface 
mount electrical connector for a printed circuit board. Box 
and pin terminals are positioned in rows adjacent a ground 
bus. The connectors are attached to the boards by posts on 
the ground bus. The terminals are insertable in cavities 
in the connector housings and can be retained in a 
partially inserted position.

A connector for a printed circuit board, the connector 
comprising: 


an insulating housing (2) having a bottom junction 
surface (2a) and a top surface (2b); 
a plurality of pin holes (3) formed at a given pitch 
through the insulating housing (2) to extend from the 

junction surface to the top surface; 
a plating layer (10) coating an inner periphery of 
each pin hole (3) and a corresponding region of the 

junction surface (2a), a portion of the plating layer (10) 
coating each region extending beyond a side surface (2c) of 

the housing to provide a lead (11) that is suitable for 
soldering to a conductive pattern formed on the printed 

circuit board; 
a plurality of pin contacts (7) each having at their 
basal ends a flange (8) and each being insertable into a 

respective pin hole (3) from the junction surface (2a) of 
the insulating housing (2), each pin contact (7) when 

inserted in a respective pin hole being held firmly therein 
and extending from the top surface (2b) of the housing (2); 
a plurality of ears (4) formed integrally with and 
protruding sideways from the side surface (2c) of the 

insulating housing (2), each of said ears (4) being located 
to correspond to a respective pin hole (3) and being coated

a guide groove (12) formed in each of the leads (11), 
the guide grooves extending from an outer periphery of a 

respective ear (4) to a respective pin hole (3), the guide 
grooves (12) guiding molten solder towards the pin holes 

(3) when the leads are soldered to the printed circuit 
board, each of the flanges (8) being in electrical contact 

with a respective lead (11) to form a pin header (1) of the 
surface-mountable type. 
Connection comprising a connector according to claim 1 and a 
socket for a printed circuit board, the socket being  

 
engagable with the connector according to Claim 1 and 

comprising: 

a further insulating housing (22) having a plurality 
of through-holes (26, 27) formed therein; and 
a plurality of socket contacts (23) each comprising a 
flat bifurcated connectable portion (24) having a lead 

extending therefrom;
