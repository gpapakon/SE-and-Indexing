<ABSTRACT>
A flexible hose section (14) is placed between an outlet aperture (18) of the road gully (6) and an intake aperture (24) of the storm sewer (10), resp. an inspection shaft connected to the sewer. An independent sewage pipe is also installed between these two apertures. The flexible hose is a one-piece section, which is cut off a length. Either hose end is connected via a connection socket (48). It is installed, so that it has a drop to the road (6) at every point. It is passed around cables (26) etc. in the road.
