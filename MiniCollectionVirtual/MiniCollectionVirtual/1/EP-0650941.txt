<ABSTRACT>
An admixture for decreasing the water demand of cementitious compositions such as 
concrete consists of 


(a) from 75-25% by weight of a water-reducing agent whose major component is a 
polycarboxylate; and 
(b) from 25-75% by weight of at least one saccharide component selected from 
hydrogenated saccharides and polyhydric alcohol adducts of saccharides. 
 
The saccharide component is preferably a hydrogenated polysaccharide with a molecular 
weight distribution as follows: 


(i) 70-30% by weight (on total weight of hydrogenated saccharides) have 
molecular weights in the range 180-300; 
(ii) 30-70% by weight have molecular weights of from 300 up to 4,000; and 
(iii) 30% by weight maximum have molecular weights of 4,000 and over.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an admixture for cementitious compositions such as 
grouts, mortars and concretes. Increasing difficulty in and expense of obtaining high quality aggregate for use 
in cementitious compositions such as concrete has forced manufacturers to resort to 
lower grade materials such as crushed stone, marine sand and even crushed concrete 
obtained from the demolition of old structures. This leads to problems with the 
concrete such as higher water demand, bleeding and lower workability and pumpability. 
It has been attempted to overcome these problems by means of admixtures. Typical of 
such admixtures are those already well known in the art, such as lignosulphonates, 
naphthalene sulphonate-formaldehyde condensates and various saccharides. Such 
materials reduce water requirement but also delay setting of the concrete, something 
which is not always desirable. It has now been found that a blend of particular materials can greatly decrease 
the quantity of water required for a given cementitious mix while not significantly 
increasing set time. In addition, the blend does not cause excessive aeration (a major 
problem with some known admixtures) and it inhibits bleeding and improves 
workability. The invention therefore provides an admixture for use in a cementitious 
composition, which admixture consists of 
(a) from 75-25% by weight of a water-reducing agent whose major 
component is a polycarboxylate; and (b) from 25-75% by weight of at least one saccharide component 
selected from hydrogenated saccharides and polyhydric alcohol 
adducts of saccharides. The water-reducing agent has as a major component a polycarboxylate which is  
 
known to be a water-reducing agent in its own right. By "major component" is meant 
that the polycarboxylate or polycarboxylates (it is permissible to use more than one 
such material) is present in higher weight proportion than any other individual 
component in the water-reducing agent. It is therefore possible for the polycarboxylate 
to comprise less than 50% of the weight of the water-reducing agent, although it is 
preferable that it comprises at least 50%. More preferably, the water reducing agent 
comprises at least 60% by weight of polycarboxylate and most preferably it is 100% 
polycarboxylate. Typical examples include poly(acrylate salt-acrylate ester) 
copolymers, poly(methacrylic acid-methacrylate) copolymers, poly(styrene- maleate salt) 
copolymers, and poly(styrene-maleate ester) copolymers. Such materials are readily 
available
