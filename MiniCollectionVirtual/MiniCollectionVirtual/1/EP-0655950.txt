<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel catalysts and their use in the conversion of 
certain olefins into chirally enriched epoxides. WO/91/14694 describes certain catalysts of the following formula (A): 
 
in which 
   M is a transition metal ion, A is an anion, and n is either 0, 1 or 2. At least 
one of X1 or X2 is selected from the group consisting of silyls, aryls, secondary 
alkyls and tertiary alkyls; and at least one of X3 or X4 is selected from the same 
group. Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5 and Y6 are independently selected from the group 
consisting of hydrogen, halides, alkyls, aryl groups, silyl groups, and alkyl groups 
bearing heteroatoms such as alkoxy and halide. Also, at least one of R1, R2, R3 and 
R4 is selected from a first group consisting of H, CH3, C2H5 and primary alkyls. 
Furthermore, if R1 is selected from said first group, then R2 and R3 are selected from 
a second group consisting of aryl groups, heteroatom-bearing aromatic groups, 
secondary alkyls and tertiary alkyls. If R2 is selected from said first group, then R1 
and R4 are selected from said second group. If R3 is selected from said first group, 
then R1 and R4 are selected from said second group. If R4 is selected from said first 
group, then R2 and R3 are selected from said second group. Such catalysts are described as being useful in enantioselectively epoxidising a 
prochiral olefin. Structurally distinct catalysts have now been prepared which surprisingly 
possess the ability to catalyse the enantioselective expoxidiation of certain prochiral 
olefins. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):  
 
 
in which M is a transition metal ion; 
A is a counter-ion if required; r, s and t are independently 0 to 3 such that r+s+t is 1, 2 or 3; Ra, Rb, Rc are each independently hydrogen or CH2OR' where R' is 
hydrogen or alkyl, alkycarbonyl, arylcarbonyl or aryl derivative; B and E are independently oxygen, CH2, NRd in which Rd is alkyl, hydrogen, 
alkylcarbonyl, or arylcarbonyl or SOn where n is 0, 1 or 2, with the proviso that B 
and E are not simultaneously CH2 and that when B is oxygen, NRd or SOn, then r 
cannot be 0, and when E is oxygen, NRd or SOn, then t cannot be 0; R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are independently hydrogen, 
alkyl or alkoxy. Suitable transition metal ions, M, include Mn, Cr, Fe, Ni, Co, Ti, V, Ru and 
Os in an appropriate oxidation state. Preferably the transition metal ion, M, is Mn in oxidation state (II) or (III). It should be appreciated that in some cases for example
