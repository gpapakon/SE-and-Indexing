<CLAIMS>
Process for the isolation of L-leucine and 
L-isoleucine from aqueous solutions containing these 

amino acids and their separation from each other, 
characterised in that the aqueous solutions are, 

optionally repeatedly, brought into contact at a pH of 

<
 7 with a zeolite having a modulus of 2 to 1000, the 
zeolite is separated once adsorption is complete and 

the adsorbed amino acids are desorbed with an aqueous 
solution adjusted to a pH of 
>
 7. 
Process according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that adsorption is performed within a 

pH range of between 1 and 
<
 7.0. 
Process according to claims 1 and 2,
 
characterised in that desorption is performed within a 

pH range of between 8 and 11. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the zeolites used are of the 

types A, X, Y, DAY, mordenite, dealuminated mordenite, 
ZSM-5, dealuminated ZSM-5, Beta, VPI-5. 
Process according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that the ZSM-5 type is used in the H 

or Na form. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that the solution contains further 

neutral amino acids.
