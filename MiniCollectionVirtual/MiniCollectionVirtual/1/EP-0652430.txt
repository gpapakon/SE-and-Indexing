<ABSTRACT>
A method 
&
 apparatus for determining carbon black in rubber 
composites (e.g. for tyres) based on time-resolved laser breakdown 

spectroscopy (TREUBS) are described. A laser beam (4a) is raster scanned 
across the sample surface (1a), and atomic or molecular emission from 

the laser excited plasma (4c) is collected from measuring points (4b), 
spectrally dispersed by grating (11) and detected using the photodiode 

array (12). To determine the carbon black distribution, spectral line 
intensity ratios relative to car
bon acting as internal standard, for 
elements present in the sample are measured at two different delay times 

after the exciting laser pulse. At short delay times 
<
 0.5 NS, carbon 
emission is due largely to carbon black; at longer delay times the 

signal represents total carbon present in the matrix. Comparison of the 
intensity ratios with calibration curves then yields the concentration 

of carbon black at the measuring point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a process for determining the carbon
black concentration and distribution in rubber compounds and
other carbon black-containing materials using pulsed laser
beams focused on the material surface each of which produce
a plasma with a radiation characteristic of the elements or
molecules contained therein and divide the surface with
their end regions into grid areas in which are located
measuring points formed by the laser beam focuses, whereby
the characteristic radiation, spectrally dispersed in the
form of spectral lines or molecule bands, is measured by a
detector unit and whereby from the concentration values
calculated by reference to numerical ratios from the
radiation intensities of selected elements/molecules with
subsequent storage and allocated to the relevant measuring
points, the concentration value curve at least over a
section of the surface is established.In one aspect, the present invention lies in having
perceived, as an essential part of a tyre manufacturing
process, the technical problem of measuring the carbon (C)
associated with the carbon black separate from the carbon of
the rubber material, particularly and preferably based on
different responses to ignition.According to this aspect, the invention also concerns a
process for manufacturing a pneumatic tyre for vehicle
wheels, substantially comprising the steps of preparing a
rubber compound for a plurality of semi-finished
components, of preparing semi-finished components from said
compounds and of assembling together said components in a
raw carcass, according to which the elemental carbon from
carbon black contained in at least one of said compounds, or 
semi-finished components, is quantitatively detected
on-line, thus monitoring in real time the dispersion degree
and the homogeneity of the carbon black in said at least one
rubber compound, so as to control and, if needed, to vary,
on the basis of said detected information, the quantity of
carbon black which is to be mixed with polymeric
materials and other ingredients for preparing said at least
one rubber compound.The invention relates further to a suitable device to
perform the process for determining the carbon black
concentration and distribution in rubber compounds and other
carbon black-containing materials, comprising means for
producing pulsed laser beams, a first optical
assembly lying in the optical axis of the laser beams comprising a first lens
arrangement and a first deflector unit for aligning the

and concentration in rubber compounds and other carbon

black-containing materials using pulsed laser beams
focused on the material surface each of which produce a

plasma with a radiation characteristic of the elements
or molecules contained therein and divide the surface

with their end regions into grid areas in which are
located measuring points formed by the laser beam

focuses, whereby the characteristic radiation, dispersed
spectrally in the form of spectral lines or molecule

bands, is identified by a detector unit and whereby from
concentration values which are calculated by reference

to numerical ratios from the radiation intensities of
selected elements/molecules with subsequent storage and

are allocated to the relevant measuring points, the

determine the value of the concentration ratio between

carbon black (c
R
