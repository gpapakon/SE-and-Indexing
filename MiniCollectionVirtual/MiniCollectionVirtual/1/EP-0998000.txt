<ABSTRACT>
A modular wire harness protector is formed by connecting together a plurality of
protector modules each including a groove having a first and a second open end.

Connectors disposed between each of the modules align the open ends of each module
to define a continuous groove which accommodates the wire harness. By "snapping"

together various modules the continuous groove can be made linear and non-linear at
various locations such that the wire harness protector is specifically tailored to the

individual wire harness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a wire harness protector, and more
particularly to a module which connects to similar modules to form a specifically tailored
protector to accommodate a wire harness.A wire harness is commonly formed by bundling a plurality of electrical wires
together prior to installation into the body of a vehicle. A wire harness connects many
electrical components within the vehicle and therefore must be protected from damage.
The harness must also be routed within the vehicle and held in place to protect the wire
harness from abrasion with other components.Within any one vehicle there are dozens of different shapes of harnesses. Also,
the harnesses vary across vehicle lines. Thus, there are hundreds of possible harness
shapes in production at any one time.Known wire harness protectors are commonly molded of a rigid plastic material
which protects and retains the wire harness in a prescribed condition. The protectors are
commonly molded in one piece for a single application and location within the vehicle.
However, it is relatively difficult and costly to manufacture the complex configurations
of such one piece protectors.Moreover, as the currently available wire harness protectors are specifically
molded for each particular use they cannot be used in multiple locations or multiple
vehicles. As noted above, there are hundreds of possible shapes. Known one piece wire
harness protectors therefore increase the quantity of inventory which must be maintained,
the assembly time required to select, retrieve, and install the proper protector, and the
overall cost. This present invention provides a unique wire harness protector that avoids the
problems of the prior art described above. The modular wire harness protector of the
present invention can be configured to multiple mounting arrangements by connecting
together two or more independent heterogenous or homogeneous modules in various
arrangements.In general terms, this invention is a wire harness protector which is formed by
connecting together a plurality of modules to form a wire harness protector of various
lengths and shapes. An individual module can be linear, or non-linear. Preferably, non-linear
modules bend the wire harness to various angles, such as 45, 60 and 90 degrees.
Each module includes a protector body having a groove for accommodating a portion of
the wire harness which extends along the length of the module such that the groove has
first and second open ends.At least one connector is located on the protector
