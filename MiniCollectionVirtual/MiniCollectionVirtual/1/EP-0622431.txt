<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an article 
including a substrate (14), such as paper, having a 

coating layer (10) on one major surface (12) thereof. The 
coating layer, which is preferably a pressure sensitive 

adhesive, includes an upper surface (16) including a 
plurality of aperiodic, irregular striae (18) formed 

therein to provide a reduced effective surface area of the 
coating layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an article with a 
striated coating layer. More specifically, the invention 
relates to paper coated with a striated layer of pressure 
sensitive adhesive. It is often desirable to coat a substrate with a 
coating material, such as an adhesive, in a desired 
location on the substrate. For example, pressure sensitive 
adhesive tape includes a web substrate coated with a layer 
of pressure sensitive adhesive. However, articles coated 
with pressure sensitive adhesive may not be susceptible of 
repositionable engagement with a surface. That is, the 
layer of adhesive contacts the entire surface of the 
object to which it is attached, and may be difficult to 
remove without damaging the article or the surface. In 
these and other cases, it may be desirable to provide an 
article including an adhesive layer that is adapted for 
repeated engagement and disengagement with a surface. Such an article is disclosed in European Patent 
Publication No. 0,279,579, published 24 August 1988. Two 
embodiments of the article shown in the '579 publication 
are shown in cross section in Figures 1 and 2. Each 
article includes a substrate 2 overlain by a pressure 
sensitive adhesive layer 1 having a releasable polyester 
film layer 3 thereon. The surface of the article includes 
a plurality of parallel and periodic groove 4 and 4', 
respectively, and peak portions 5 and 5' adapted for 
contact with a surface. The adhesive sheet may be adhered 
to a surface (the "adherent") by removing the releasable 
polyester film layer 3 and touching the adhesive side of 
the sheet to the surface. Thus, "the boundary face between 
the adhesive sheet and an adherent approaches point-contact 
or line-contact..." along the peaks of the 
adhesive layer.  The title of the '579 publication is "Irregular 
Section Adhesive Sheets," and the term "irregular" is 
defined in the specification to mean that a cross 
sectional view would reveal "pressure-sensitive adhesive 
layer [that] is uneven or air passages are formed in the 
adhesion face." This definition is understood to mean that 
the top surface of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer 
is nonplanar, although it in fact is both regular and 
periodic. The article disclosed in the '579 publication, 
although having a certain utility, may not be desirable 
for some applications. For example, it may be difficult to 
apply a relatively thin layer of coating material (known 
as a "low coating weight") to the substrate, because the 
article is typically made by molding a
