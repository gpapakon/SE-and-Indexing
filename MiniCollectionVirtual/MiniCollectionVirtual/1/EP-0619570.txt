<ABSTRACT>
A light activated alarm system for indicating to the 
occupants of a second vehicle the presence of a first 

vehicle. The alarm system comprising a photosensitive 
cell, a receiver circuit and indicators. The 

photosensitive cell is mounted in one of a variety of 
locations on the second vehicle, including the rear bumper, 

the rear window well, the stop light in the rear window 
well, the roof or the antenna. The photosensitive cell is 

either silver dollar shaped or an array of preferably five 
photo cells in a semi-spherical or box shape. The signal 

from the photosensitive cell is detected, amplified, 
filtered and identified by the receiver circuit. When a 

signal from an activated light source is identified, the 
receiver circuit generates an indicator signal. The 

indicator signal activates one or more indicators to alert 
the occupants of the second vehicle to the presence of the 

first vehicle. Indicators include turning on or muting the 
second vehicle's radio system and transmitting a signal 

through the radio system, turning off or muting the radio 
system and transmitting a signal through a separate buzzer 

system and turning on a separate visual display that 
flashes the words "Emergency Vehicle" or a red light. A 

return, feed-back indicator is also provided for notifying 
the driver of the first vehicle that the second vehicle 

received and processed the signal from the light source.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to alarm systems for 
indicating to the occupants of a second vehicle the 
proximity of a first vehicle. More particularly, this 
invention relates to an alarm system wherein a first 
vehicle's strobe light or laser light source activates 
indicators in a second vehicle to alert the occupants of 
the second vehicle to the proximity of the first vehicle. Many modern vehicle passenger compartments are 
designed and built to be quiet when their windows are 
closed. Outside noises coming from car horns and radios 
are prevented from entering the passenger compartment and 
distracting the driver. Unfortunately, emergency vehicle 
sirens and train whistles are also prevented from entering 
the passenger compartment. Car radios or sound systems 
played at moderate levels inside the vehicle make it even 
more difficult to hear outside alarms. Thus, an emergency 
vehicle siren or a train whistle may be undetected by the 
occupants of a vehicle. This creates a hazardous situation 
on the highways. Emergency vehicles need an unobstructed path to 
respond to an emergency within an acceptable time frame. 
The occupants of the emergency vehicle need to be able to 
change traffic signals and alert the drivers of other 
vehicles to the presence of the emergency vehicle. In the 
past, radio frequency energy has been used to alert the 
occupants of one vehicle to the presence of another 
vehicle. Radio frequency signals were transmitted from one 
vehicle and detected by an unsuspecting second vehicle. 
Upon detection, a warning signal was generated in the 
second vehicle. The warning signal was transmitted over 
the radio or through independent audio and visual 
components. This method is shown in U.S. Patent No.  
 
3,854,119, issued to Friedman et al, and U.S. Patent No. 
3,876,940, issued to Wickord et al. The Friedman patent describes receiving and 
identifying amplitude modulated signals to operate 
switching means for activating devices such as audio 
speakers, light emitting diodes, panel displays or neon 
lights in relation to the amplitude of the received 
signals. The Wickord patent discloses a warning device 
utilizing radio transmission on an assigned frequency 
having a transmitter in the emergency vehicle and a 
receiver in the regular vehicle. One feature of the 
Wickord patent is the conversion of the received signal to 
the intermediate frequency of a radio receiver, muting the 
broadcast reception on the radio or turning the radio on 
(if it is off), and applying a
