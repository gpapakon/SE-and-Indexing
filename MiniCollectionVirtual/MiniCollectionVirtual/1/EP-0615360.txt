<ABSTRACT>
A clock synchronizing circuit comprises
 

   a voltage 
controlled oscillator (VCO) (5) for producing 

an output signal whose oscillation frequency changes in 
response to control signals (S3). A phase comparator (1) compares 

a phase of an input signal and a phase of the output signal 
to thereby generate a phase difference signal (S1). A filter (2) 

filters the phase difference signal to thereby output a 
filtered phase difference signal (S2). A frequency synchronizing 

circuit responsive to the filtered phase difference signal 
generates a first compensation signal for controlling a 

frequency of the output signal. A phase synchronizing 
circuit responsive to the filtered phase difference signal 

generates a second compensation signal for controlling a 
phase of the output signal. A signal supplying circuit 

feeds the first and second compensation signals as said 
control signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clock synchronizing 
circuit and, more particularly, to a clock synchronizing 
circuit for synchronizing, in a network, a clock signal 
to be generated in a terminal node to a clock signal sent 
from a clock feeding device included in a master node. It is a common practice with a large scale digital 
communication network to implement a network synchronizing 
system with a master-slave scheme. In a master-slave 
synchronizing system, a master node generates a clock 
signal with a clock generating device thereof and sends 
it to a terminal node. The terminal node generates a 
clock signal based on the received clock thereinside. 
A conventional clock synchronizing circuit using the 
master-slave scheme has a phase difference detector for 
producing a voltage signal representative of a phase 
difference between an input and an output clock signal, 
a low pass filter, and a voltage controlled oscillator 
(VCO) for producing a predetermined clock signal matching 
the voltage signal. The problem with such a clock 
synchronizing circuit is as follows. The frequency 
of the output clock signal is controlled on the basis 
of the phase difference between an input and an output 
clock signal. Hence, when the frequency of the input  
 
clock signal, which is the reference, is changed or 
interrupted for a moment due to jitter or similar cause, 
the phase difference detector detects the change or 
interruption and feeds the resulting output thereof to 
the VCO as a phase difference signal. As a result, the 
VCO outputs a clock signal proportional to the change in 
the frequency of the input clock signal. Moreover, in 
an application of the kind requiring a stable output clock 
signal, uncontrollable phase deviations occur since the 
output clock signal is controlled on the basis of a 
variation width produced by a temperature compensation 
circuit which is included in the VCO. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a clock synchronizing circuit capable of 
producing a stable output clock signal even when the 
phase of an input clock signal changes. A clock synchronizing circuit of the present invention 
comprises a VCO for producing an output signal whose 
oscillation frequency changes in response to control 
signals. A comparator compares the phase of an input 
signal and that of the output signal to thereby generate 
a phase difference signal. A filter filters the phase 
difference signal to thereby output a filtered phase 
difference signal. A
