<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a tread rubber
composition having excellent performance on ice and
suitable for a studless tyre, as well as a tyre
having a tread manufactured using the rubber
composition.A spiked tyre exhibits an excellent gripping force
on a frozen road surface. Since the spiked tyre has
a large digging friction force, among hysteresis
loss friction, adhesion friction and digging
friction which are the factors mainly related to the
gripping force between a tread rubber and a road
surface, it exhibits an excellent gripping force on
a frozen road surface.However, use of the spiked tyre has gradually been
restricted legally as a countermeasure for public
pollution caused by powdery dusts in recent years,
and a studless tyre with no spikes have been rapidly
popularised. In some studless tyres, the digging
friction force is improved, for example, by the
device of incorporating a blowing agent or organic 
fibres thereby increasing the unevenness on the
surface of the tread. However, since a studless
tyre has a lower digging friction force compared
with a spiked tyre, its gripping force is inferior.
In particular, if the road surface is ground flat by
slip or idle rotation of a tyre upon starting on a
frozen road surface, the gripping force of the
studless tyre is even more deteriorated and so
further improvement is now demanded.On a road surface with an extremely low friction
coefficient such as a frozen road surface, the
hysteresis loss friction is extremely small but
adhesion friction (tract) also contributes to the
improvement of the gripping force in addition to the
digging friction. Therefore, it has been arranged
to increase the gripping force on the frozen road
surface for a studless tyre by increasing the one
other of the frictions contributing to the gripping
force, that is, the tract.As a method of improving tract it has been proposed
to eliminate hydroplaning caused upon thawing of the
frozen road surface caused by friction upon starting
and braking, thereby increasing the area of contact
between the tread rubber and the iced surface, or by 
making the rubber material softer to increase the
area of contact with the road surface.Increased unevenness on the tread surface can
increase the digging friction, as well as taking up
surface water into concave portions to eliminate
hydroplaning. However, increase of the concave
portions for the elimination of the hydroplaning
effect leads to decrease in the area which is in
contact with the iced surface, which is contrary to
the required
