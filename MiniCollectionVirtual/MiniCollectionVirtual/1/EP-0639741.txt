<ABSTRACT>
The heat exchanger comprises at least one metal arch (20) having a shape similar to the shape of the arched parts (5b) of the tubes of the bundle, fixed at each of its ends on the bracing plate (10a) situated closest to the arched parts (5b) of the tubes, in the continuation of two stay rods (14), inserted between two successive tubes of a plane sheet of tubes (18) and comprising means (22) for fixing the assembly of anti-vibration bars (13) inserted between two adjacent sheets of tubes.

Heat exchanger comprising a bundle of heat exchange 
tubes (5) bent in a U-shape and each comprising two 

straight parts (5a) and a curved part (5b); a tube plate 
(3) and a plurality of crossbracing plates (10) which 

are parallel to one another and spaced in the 
longitudinal direction of the straight parts (5a) of the 

tubes (5), wherein the tubes (5) of the bundle engage in 
through-openings which ensure that the tubes (5) are 

held in flat layers (18) parallel to one another; tie-rods 
(14) for securing the crossbracing plates (10) 

arranged inside the bundle parallel to the straight 
parts of the tubes (5); and sets of anti-vibration bars 

(13) intercalated between the curved parts (5b) of the 
tubes (5) arranged in adjacent layers (18), 

characterised in that it further comprises, for securing 
at least one set of anti-vibration bars (13), arranged 

between the tubes (5) of two adjacent layers (18), at 
least one metal arch (20) the shape of which is 

analogous to the shape of the curved parts (5b) of the 
tubes (5) in the bundle, fixed at each of its ends to 

the crossbracing plate (10a) situated closest to the 
curved parts (5b) of the tubes (5), on an extension of 

two tie-rods (14), intercalated between two tubes (5) of 
a layer of tubes (18) and comprising fixing means (18) 

for the set of anti-vibration bars (13) intercalated 
between the layer (18) in which the arch (20) is located 

and at least one adjacent layer. 
Heat exchanger according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the metal arch (20) consists of successive 

segments (21) held together by assembly means (22) which 
also secure the anti-vibration bars (13). 
Heat exchanger according to claim 2, characterised  
 

in that the arch (20) of semi-circular shape consists of 
successive segments (21) in the form of arcs of a 

circle. 
Heat exchanger according to one of claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the successive segments (21) of 

the arch (20) are held together by screwing and comprise 
assembly means (22a, 22b; 21a, 21b) between which the 

anti-vibration bars (13) are gripped. 
Heat exchanger according to any one of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the arch (20) is fixed at each 

of its ends to the crossbracing plate (10a), via fixing 
means (19) which constitute tensors for exerting 

traction on the ends of the arch (20). 
Heat exchanger according to claim 5, characterised 
in that the fixing means (19) in the form of a tensor 

comprise a first element (24) having means (24a) for 
attachment to the crossbracing plate (10a) and a tapped 

bore (24b), a rod (25) comprising two threaded parts of 
opposite pitch (25a, 25b) and a screw nut (26) between 

the two threaded parts and a second element (21'a) 
constituting an end segment of the arch (20) comprising 

a tapped opening, the threaded rod (25) being adapted to 
be screwed simultaneously, by its threaded parts of 

opposite pitch (25a, 25b), in the tapped openings (24b) 
of the first element (24) which is integral with the 

crossbracing plate (10a) and of the second element 
(21'a) constituting an end segment of the arch (20). 
Heat exchanger according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the means (24a) for fixing the first element 

(24) to the crossbracing plate (10a) is a tapped bore 
(24a) capable of being screwed onto a threaded part 

(14a) of a tie-rod (14) passing through the crossbracing 
plate (10a).  

 
Heat exchanger according to any one of claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that it comprises at least two 

arches (20a, 20b, 20c, 20d) arranged symmetrically with 
respect to a plane of symmetry (28) of the bundle of the 

steam generator. 
Use of a heat exchanger according to any one of 
claims 1 to 8, as a steam generator of a pressurised 

water nuclear reactor.
