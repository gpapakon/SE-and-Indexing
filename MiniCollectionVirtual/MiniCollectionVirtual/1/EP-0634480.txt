<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a detergent composition comprising 
alkali metal percarbonate and alkyl polysaccharide 

surfactant which gives improved overall performance, in 
particular removal of greasy stains, over compositions 

comprising perborate and alkyl polysaccharide. There is 
also provided a low temperature washing process in which 

the composition of the invention is a laundry detergent 
composition and is introduced into the wash liquor during 

the wash. Such a process is particularly effective when 
the laundry comprises hydrophobic material such as 

polyester and polycotton.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
granular laundry detergent compositions comprising alkyl
polysaccharide surfactants. The laundry detergent
compositions are particularly suitable for use in a low
temperature process for washing laundry in a domestic
washing machine.Grease and oil cleaning performance is one important
attribute of many, if not most, detergent compositions.
Linear alkyl benzene sulphonates have traditionally been
utilised in detergent compositions for their superior
grease/oil and good overall cleaning ability over a wide
variety of wash conditions. Whereas linear alkyl benzene
sulphonates have performed admirably, they tend to be
largely petroleum-derived surfactants. Thus, it is
desirable to decrease the level of these and other
petroleum-derived surfactants and replace them with
surfactants that typically are primarily derived from
renewable resources, so long as excellent overall cleaning,
including grease and oil removal, could be maintained.It is known to incorporate alkyl polysaccharide, in
particular alkyl polyglucoside, surfactants into detergent
compositions to proportionally reduce the level of, or
eliminate, linear alkyl benzene sulphonate and other
petroleum-derived surfactants. Excellent overall cleaning,
including grease and oil cleaning, over a wide variety of
conditions is preserved. The use of alkyl polysaccharide
surfactants in laundry detergent composition is described
in, for instance, EP-A-0,075,994 and EP-A-0,075,995
JP-A-2238098, EP-A-490040 and WO-A-9307246.
Their
use for a variety of purposes is described in EP 70074.It is known to provide detergent compositions
incorporating an inorganic perhydrate salt as a source of
oxygen bleach. The inorganic perhydrate bleach most widely
used in detergent compositions is sodium perborate in the
form of either the monohydrate or the tetrahydrate. It is
believed that on dissolution in water, perborate gives 
borate ions and that these borate ions are capable of
forming ionic complexes with α(vicinal) diols such as alkyl
polysaccharides. Such ionic complexes have increased
solubility and hydrophilicity over the non-complexed alkyl
polysaccharide and so their interaction with and removal of
grease and oil is altered and this can be undesirable. It
can reduce performance.This problem is particularly noticeable when the
detergent composition contains, relative to the amount of
polysaccharide, a large proportion of perborate or a large
proportion of anionic surfactant.According to the invention there is provided a granular laundry
deterge
