<ABSTRACT>
A filter (1) for a smoking article incorporating 
particles coated with platinum selectively reduces the 

amount of volatiles of mainstream smoking article smoke 
passing through the filter. The platinum may be a 

continuous or discontinuous coating, usually on a 
coating of another metal, and this coating(s) will 

usually encapsulate the particle substrate. This 
substrate may be low activity activated carbon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to smoking articles such
as cigarettes and filters for such articles.The invention is concerned with the improvement
of the filter in or for such an article by using
platinum metal therein.A certain amount of prior art exists on the use
of transition metals in filters of smoking articles.
Most of it stresses the alleged catalytic effect of the
presence of such metals and has concentrated on
presenting those metals in as active a form as
possible.Examples of this are seen in US-A-4 317 460 (= FR-A-2
414 882) and
in a paper of the Research Laboratories of Eastman
Chemical Products entitled "Results of Experimental
Work to Remove carbon monoxide from a mixture of oxygen
and nitrogen by Use of Modified Cigarette Filters",
publication of which appears to have occurred in March
1978.These publications were concentrating on the
removal of carbon monoxide by catalytic oxidation.
In US-A-4 317 460 the supports used are microporous
supports characteristic of catalysts, namely alumina or
zeolites and the disclosure stresses the importance of
distribution of the chosen metals throughout and within 
the support material, and also the importance of the
generation of activated surfaces by the crushing of
pre-impregnated pellets.One of the metals mentioned is platinum but
only in mixtures with other metals and especially in
mixtures with rhodium, rhenium or tin. Such mixtures
are intimate and as far as possible evenly distributed
in the supports. In Example 4 thereof, platinum is
deposited on the supports after tin.In the "Results of Experimental Work ..." paper
the author studied the effects of various oxidative
catalysts including manganese dioxide and palladium.
The study concluded that the carrier was a controlling
factor and showed that platinum gave about the same
results as palladium when borne on alumina but when
borne on other materials no activity was observed.In JP-B-82-011630 a cigarette filter has a
layer of palladium or platinum supported on a composite
of cement and powdered activated carbon and covered by
second and third layers of respectively further
activated carbon and an oxidant. This filter is said
to remove carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen from
cigarette smoke.In JP-A-60-216843 platinum of high specific surface
area is coated pyrolytically onto alumina particles to form
oxidising catalyst filter material. When used as a tobacco
filter this oxidises toxic gases and may absorb nicotine and tar. Thus the picture emerges of various elaborate
and expensive suggestions for
