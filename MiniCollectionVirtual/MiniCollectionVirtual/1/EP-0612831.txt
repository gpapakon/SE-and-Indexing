<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a flame retardant hydraulic oil 
excellent in the flame retardancy, heat stability and oxidative 

stability, unaccompanied by the dangers of pinhole fire and 
giving rise to no environmental contamination. 
This flame retardant hydraulic oil contain a hydraulic base 
oil comprising as the essential component a synthetic ester, 

which is a product formed by reacting (A) at least one polyol 
selected from the group consisting of neopentyl glycol, 2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropyl-2', 

2'-dimethyl-3'-hydroxypropionate, 
glycerin and trimethylolpropane with (B) a carboxylic acid 

comprising 15 to 85% by mole of oleic acid based on the total 
carboxylic acid and 15 to 85% by mole of isostearic acid based 

on the total carboxylic acid or a carboxylic acid obtained by 
incorporating into said carboxylic acid 85% by mole or less of 

monocarboxylic acid having 6 to 22 carbon atoms (excluding 
oleic acids and isostearic acids) based on the total carboxylic 

acid. Said synthetic ester has a kinematic viscosity of 40 to 
80cSt at 40째C and a flash point of 290째C or higher.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame retardant hydraulic
oil to be used in rolling mills, die casting machines and the
like in the field of the steel making industry and the
nonferrous metal industry and in hydraulic instruments and the
like in the construction industry. More particularly, it
relates to a flame retardant hydraulic oil excellent in the
flame retardancy, heat stability and oxidative stability,
unaccompanied by the dangers of pinhole fire at sites of use
and giving rise to no environmental contamination.Generally, it is essential that the flame retardant
hydraulic oils have the following characteristics:
(1) they are excellent in viscosity-temperature properties
to ensure the transmission of pressure and power,(2) they have appropriate viscosities to minimize the loss
of pressure and power,(3) they are excellent in the heat stability, oxidative
stability and lubricity to provide the longer service life,(4) they are excellent in the demulsibility to protect from
the possible mixture of water, and(5) they have flash points high enough not to permit the
continuous burning even if they are ignited, since it is quite
likely that they are used where there are the high risks of
fire.As these flame retardant hydraulic oils, there have been
conventionally used those of emulsion series, those of water-glycol
series, those of phosphoric acid ester series, those of
fatty acid ester series and the like.However, the hydraulic oils of emulsion series and those of
water-glycol series are short on their heat stability, oxidative
stability, lubricity or accompanied by the difficulty to
dispose of waste water.Furthermore, the hydraulic oils of phosphoric acid ester
series have the shortcomings that their viscosity-temperature
properties and hydrolytic resistance are deficient, they are
responsible for the deterioration of seal materials and the
exfoliation of coats and it is difficult to dispose of waste
oils by burning.On the other hand, the hydraulic oils of fatty acid ester
series are good on the above-mentioned points, having found
their application in wide segments of market. But they are
deficient in the fire resistance and flame retardancy. Various
studies have been conducted in an attempt to overcome these
problems incidental to the hydraulic oils of fatty acid ester
series. In fact, the technique covering the flame retardant
oils of fatty acid ester series has been disclosed, for example
in Japanese Patent Applications Laid Open No. 18467 /1980, No.
226096/1984, No. 125598/1988, No. 214795/1990
