<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a satellite receiver which has a device by means of which a control voltage is generated for the external unit of the satellite receiving system. Depending on the program location in each case selected, the control voltage is either a DC voltage or a DC voltage on which an AC component is superimposed. To generate the DC voltage with AC component, a controllable voltage regulator is provided, the control input of which is supplied with a control DC voltage with an AC component.
