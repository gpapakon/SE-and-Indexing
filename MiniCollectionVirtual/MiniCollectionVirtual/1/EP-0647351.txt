<ABSTRACT>
The flow switch assembly (10) of a fluid power apparatus comprises a fluid flow pressure operated switch (10) which activates upon the failure or degradation of fluid flow. A body (14) contains therein a blind bore (15) which receives a piston (71) biased by a spring (17) located at the bottom (13) of the bore (15). A switch housing (11) which is molded about a contact (20) is threadedly inserted into an open threaded end (16) of the bore (15). The bore (15) communicates with a fluid flow opening such that fluid pressure causes the piston (71) to retract against the spring (17). The contact (20) extends axially beyond a wall (11A) of the switch housing (11) such that a radially enlarged portion (21) provides a seat for a seal (30) which sealingly engages the radially enlarged portion (21) and a surface of the bore (15). If fluid flow should cease or fall below a predetermined pressure level, the piston (71) is displaced by the spring (17) and engages the contact (20) to complete a circuit and energize an electric motor pump which provides fluid pressure to the associated fluid power apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
fluid flow switch assembly, and in particular to a fluid 
flow switch assembly for a fluid power apparatus. A fluid power apparatus may be operated by means 
of fluid pressure provided by a vehicle's power steering 
pump, by a dedicated electric pump, or by an electric 
motor pump which serves as a backup pump in case of 
failure of the main pressure source. Isakson U. S. 
Patent No. 4,961,846 incorporated by reference herein 
discloses a fluid power apparatus which is operated by 
means of fluid pressure from a power steering pump. As 
illustrated in Isakson U. S. Patent No. 4,961,846 and 
Figure 1 herein, a flow switch 70 comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1 includes a contact 75 
which may be engaged by a spring 72 biased piston 71 
should adequate pressure fail to be provided by the power 
steering pump. In the absence of either fluid pressure 
or sufficient fluid pressure via opening 28 and which 
normally causes piston 71 to retract against the spring 
72, piston 71 is displaced by spring 72 such that it 
engages the contact 75 of flow switch 70 and energizes an 
electric pump which then provides fluid pressure to the 
fluid power apparatus. The flow switch 70 includes a 
switch housing made of NylonÂ® which typically includes a 
mold line therealong. The seal 61 disposed about the 
switch housing is lifted slightly away from the switch 
housing by the material at the mold line and this may 
result in a leakage of fluid between the molded switch 
housing and seal. Additionally, the switch housing may 
shrink slightly such that fluid may leak between the 
switch housing and contact assembly. It is highly 
desirable to provide a flow switch assembly which 
prevents any leakage of fluid from the seal/switch 
housing interface and also from the switch contact/switch 
housing interface. Additionally, it is desirable to 
provide a smaller seal such that fluid pressure acting 
thereon may be reduced.  
 The present invention provides solutions to the 
above problems by providing a fluid flow switch assembly, 
comprising a body having therein a bore, the bore 
communicating with a fluid flow opening and fluid flow 
outlet, a piston disposed in said bore and biased by 
resilient means, one end of the bore enclosed by a switch 
housing, the switch housing having therein a switch 
contact, the switch contact extending at one end 
exteriorly of said switch housing and body and extending 
at the other end from said switch housing and into said 
bore,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fluid flow switch assembly, comprising a 
body (14) having therein a bore (15), the bore (15) 

communicating with a fluid flow opening (28) and fluid 
flow outlet, a piston (71) disposed in said bore (15) and 

biased by resilient means (17), one end (16) of the bore 
(15) enclosed by a switch housing (11), the switch 

housing (11) having therein a switch contact (20), the 
switch contact (20) extending at one end (27) exteriorly 

of said switch housing (11) and body (14) and extending 
at the other end (21) from said switch housing (11) and 

into said bore (15), so that 
fluid flow through said bore (15) retains the piston (71) 

in a retracted position and a reduction in fluid flow 
below a predetermined level permits the resilient means 

(17) to displace said piston (71) into engagement with 
said contact (20), characterized in that the other end 

(21) of the contact (20) comprises a radially enlarged 
portion (21) which extends axially toward an inner 

portion of the bore to a radially enlarged shoulder (22), 
seal means (30) disposed about said radially enlarged 

portion (21) to sealingly engage the other end (21) of 
the contact (20) and a surface of said bore (15). 
The fluid flow switch assembly in accordance 
with Claim 1, characterized in that the contact (20) 

further includes an intermediate radially extending 
flange (24) and the switch housing (11) molded about said 

contact (20), so that the contact (20) is located in a 
stationary position relative to said bore (15) as a 

result of the switch housing (11) being fixed to said 
body (14). 
The fluid flow switch assembly in accordance 
with Claim 2, characterized in that said switch housing 

(11) includes a radially extending wall (11a) at an end 
of the housing (11) adjacent the other end (21) of said  

 
contact (20), such that the seal means (30) is maintained 

axially in place between the radially extending wall 
(11a) and radially enlarged shoulder (22) of the contact 

(20). 
The fluid flow switch assembly in accordance 
with Claim 3, characterized in that said contact (20) 

comprises a longitudinally extending member having 
progressively smaller diameters along the length thereof, 

such that a first large diameter (22) comprises the 
radially enlarged shoulder (22), a second large diameter 

(21) comprises the radially enlarged portion (21), a 
third large diameter (23) comprises a portion between 

said radially enlarged portion (21) and said intermediate 
radially extending flange (24), and a fourth diameter 

(25) comprises a portion between the intermediate 
radially extending flange (24) and the one end (27) of 

the switch contact (20).
