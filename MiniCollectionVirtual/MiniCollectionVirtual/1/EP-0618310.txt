Process for the production of wear-resistant edges on turbine blades,
for example in the field of the upper blade entry and at the cover

blade, 
characterized in that
a) a recess is provided at the appropriate spot of the blade prior to
the application of the edge protection
b) a powder film made of wear-resistant material is applied to the
appropriate spot of the blade by way of powder dumping in

capsule technique,
c) said powder film subsequently being comparted by way of hot
isostatic pressing (HIP), thus creating a diffuse bond to the

blade base material,
d) to apply the powder film a cavity is created above the recess
for the powder forming the HIP protection later on after the HIP

procedure in such a manner that a plate being greater by the
powder shrinkage volume is welded onto the blade in the area

of the edge protection and removed again after the HIP
procedure, and that
e) the blade is provided with projecting weld edges or blades
which are worked-off on machining later-on to produce the final

blade geometry.
Process pursuant to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the powder film to
be applied consists of a material and/or a combination of materials

which at least in quotas consists of the same or similar material type
as the blade material.
Process pursuant to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the powder
film to be applied is so chosen in relation to the blade material that a

solid-state diffusion through solution equilibrii becomes possible. 
Process to at least any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 powders are utilized which react to intermetallic compounds in
the course of the HIP process.
Process pursuant to at least any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 harder phases, preferably hard materials, are
admixed to the powder.
Process pursuant to at least any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 powder made of stellite or CrxCy-mixtures or
NiCrBSi-alloys or metal/ceramic grades are utilized for protection of

blades made of chromium.
Process pursuant to at least any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 powders made of Ti/TiC or TiAl6V4/TiC or Ti
(X, Y, Z, U, V) with X, Y, Z = (Al, Si, V, Zr, W, Ta, Cr) and U, V (= B,

O, C, N) with X, Y, Z, U, V 
>
 0, are utilized for the protection of edges
of blades with titanium master alloys.
