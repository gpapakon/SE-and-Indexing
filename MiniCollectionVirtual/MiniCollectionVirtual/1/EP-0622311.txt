<ABSTRACT>
A liquid spray bottle preventing the contamination of a 
pharmaceutical liquid likely to be caused by entry of outside air 

and completely spraying all the pharmaceutical liquid. A main 
body (10) of the spray bottle having a flexible liquid container (12) 

which can be contracted according to the consumption of the liquid. 
An outer case (20) covers to protect the container. A spray pump (30) 

functions to draw the liquid from the container and spray out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid spray bottle for 
spraying a pharmaceutical liquid, i.e., for nosal pits, throat or 
the like, and more particularly, to a liquid spray bottle preventing 
the contamination of the pharmaceutical liquid (hereinafter 
referred to simply as "liquid"). As a sprayer for applying liquid to an affected part, a 
liquid spray bottle has been known. Such known liquid spray 
bottle is generally fitted with a spray pump which has a spray 
nozzle at the mouth of a liquid container. When the spray pump is 
operated, the liquid is drawn up to the spray nozzle through a 
suction pipe which is inserted within the liquid container, and 
is sprayed out through the spray nozzle. The spray pump employed 
is a very small one which can be operated by single finger. The container of the above-described known liquid spray 
bottle must be open to the outside atmosphere for the purpose of 
drawing the outside air into the container when the spray pump is 
operated to spray out the liquid. In this case, however, there 
arises such a problem that various kind of bacteria floating in 
the outside air is inevitably carried into the container, which 
cause the contaminating of the liquid. Provided that the container  
 
is fully sealed not to allow the entrance of the outside 
air into the container, no atmospheric pressure will be applied 
to the liquid, with the result that the liquid will not be drawn 
into the spray pump even if the spray pump is operated. Furthermore, since the liquid in the container is drawn into 
the spray pump through the suction pipe, it is difficult to draw 
all the liquid completely. The liquid remaining in the container, 
therefore, goes to waste. Particularly most recent collunaria 
is expensive since it contains medicinally active ingredient 
in high concentration, therefore it is quite uneconomical that 
the remaining much liquid is dumped as unused. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a liquid spray bottle which can prevent the liquid in the 
container from contaminating by various kind of bacteria floating 
in the outside air and minimize the amount of liquid being remained 
in the container. To achieve above described object, the present invention 
provides a liquid spray bottle comprising: a main body having, in 
the lower part, a container made of flexible material for holding 
a liquid, an outer case connected to the main body for covering 
the container, and a spray pump mounted on the main body, the 
container being
