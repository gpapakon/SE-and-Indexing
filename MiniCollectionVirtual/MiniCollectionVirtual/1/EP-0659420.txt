<DESCRIPTION>
Sexual precocity is defined as the appearance of 
any sign of secondary sexual maturation at an age more than 
two standard deviations below the mean (age 8 for girls). 
In cases of sexual precocity, production of endogenous 
estrogen at an early age results in the premature onset of 
puberty. Several different forms of sexual precocity, also 
termed precocious puberty, have been identified including 
true precocious puberty (complete isosexual precocity), 
incomplete isosexual precocity, and contrasexual precocity. 
Variations include premature thelarche, premature isolated 
menarche, and premature adrenarche. Complete isosexual precocity results from early 
activation of hypothalamic LHRH pulse generator pituitary 
gonadotropin-gonadal axis and is thus LHRH dependent. This 
form of precocious puberty is more prevalent in girls than 
boys and results in the appearance of breast development, 
enlargement of the laboria minora, and maturational changes 
in the vaginal mucosa along with pubic hair appearance. 
Accordingly, sexual maturation is more rapid than in normal 
puberty. The rapid growth is associated with increases in 
serum IGFI levels because of increased gonadal estrogen 
secretion. True precocious puberty often results from CNS 
tumors (including optic and hypothalamic gliomas, 
astrocytomas, and ependymonas) which interfere with the 
LHRH pulse generator in childhood. Other CNS diseases 
often association with this form of early puberty include 
hydrocephalus, encephalitis, static cerebral encephalopathy 
and brain abcess. Currently, three principal agents have been used 
to treat true precocious puberty including 
medroxyprogesterone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and LHRH 
agonists. The former two agents reverse or stop secondary 
sexual characteristics but do not effect final height, 
particularly for girls. The lack of effect on final height  
 
is presumably due to the action of circulating estradiol on 
skeletal growth. Thus, these agents do not correct for the 
excessive amount of circulating estradiol. LHRH agonists 
are currently the therapy of choice for true precocious 
puberty and act to block the effects endogenous LHRH and 
functions as selective, highly specific inhibitors of 
estrogen secretion without interfering directly with the 
release of other pituitary hormones. Discontinuing 
treatment results in reversal of estrogen suppression and 
allows for progression of sexual maturation. Side effects 
include local systematic allergic reactions. Incomplete isosexual precocity
