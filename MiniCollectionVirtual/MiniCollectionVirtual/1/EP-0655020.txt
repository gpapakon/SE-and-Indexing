<ABSTRACT>
A process and device for making metallised contacts in which solder material shaped into a body (18) is conveyed by means of a power transmission device (13) guided in a capillary (12) and acting like a stamp to a contact surface (24) of a substrate (25) and power is applied to it by the power transmission device (13) for shaping and bonding to the contact surface (24).

Method of metallising a contact area (27) in which solder 
material formed into a solder material moulded body (18, 34, 

41) by means of an energy transmission device (13) guided in a 
capillary (12) and acting as a punch is transported against a 

contact face (24) of a substrate (25) and is acted on with 
power by the power transmission device (13) for shaping and 

connection to the contact face (24). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that as an 
energy transmission device a fibreoptic device consisting of 

at least one optical fibre (13) is used, which serves to 
transmit laser energy. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the solder material moulded body (18) is supplied to an output 

chamber at the end of the capillary (12), in such a manner 
that the solder material moulded body (18) is disposed before 

contacting with the contact face (24) between a contact end 
(21) of the energy transmission device (13) and an output 

aperture (22) of the capillary (12). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the solder material is supplied in continuous form, preferably 

as a solder wire (30), to an output chamber (20) at the end of 
the capillary (12) in such a manner that a solder material end 

(33) projects into the output chamber (20) formed between a 
contact end (21) of the energy transmission device (13) and an 

output aperture (22) of the capillary (12) and the formation 
of a solder material moulded body (34) takes place by the 

application of energy by means of the energy transmission 
device (13) via a recasting process. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that, by 
the energy application by means of the energy transmission 

device (13), separation of the solder material moulded body 
(34) from the continuous solder material (30) is effected.  

 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
solder material moulded body (34), after the application of 

energy to the solder material end (33), is formed connected to 
the continuous solder material (30) and is then separated from 

the solder material by the contact end (21) of the energy 
transmission device (13). 
Method according to one or more of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the solder material moulded body (18, 

34) is held in the output chamber (20) by a holding device 
preferably in the form of a vacuum device before application 

to the contact face (24). 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one or 
more of claims 1 to 7, having a capillary body (11) for 

receiving and guiding a punch-like energy transmission device 
(13) attachable to an energy source, wherein the capillary 

body (11) is provided with a supply device (17, 31) for solder 
material, which leads into an output chamber (20) at the end 

of the capillary (12), which is formed between a contact end 
(21) of the energy transmission device (13) and an output 

aperture (22) of the capillary (12). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that the 
energy transmission device consists of a fibreoptic device 

having at least one optical fibre (13). 
Apparatus according to claim 8 or 9, characterised in 
that the output chamber (20) is provided with a holding device 

formed as a vacuum device. 
Apparatus according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the output chamber (20) is 

formed at least partly as a bottom die (26).
