<ABSTRACT>
A plug cap includes a plug cap body and a rain cover (24) having an air vent 
aperture (28) for communication between a spark plug mounting hole and the 

atmosphere. There is provided a sealing member (29) including a shaft portion (30) 
extending through the air vent aperture (28) and movably inserted therein with play 

and valve portions (31, 32) formed on projecting portions at opposite ends of the 
shaft portion (30) and having sizes larger than that of the air vent aperture (28). 

The shaft portion (30) includes a tapered shaft portion (30b) for closing an outer 
edge of the air vent aperture (28) by movement of the sealing member (29) toward 

the spark plug mounting hole, and a vent (33) for communication between the spark 
plug mounting hole and the atmosphere by movement of the sealing member (29) 

away from the spark plug mounting hole. An air vent structure for the plug cap 
reliably prevents water from entering the spark plug mounting hole.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air vent structure for a plug cap applied to 
a DOHC (double over head camshaft) type gasoline engine and the like. This type of air vent structure is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Utility 
Model Application Laid-Open No. 5-59786 (1993). As shown in Figs. 12 and 13, 
a plug cap 1 comprises a plug cap body 2 and a rain cover 3. The plug cap 1 is 
inserted into a spark plug mounting hole 4 to connect an ignition cable 7 to a spark 
plug 6 mounted to an engine 5 and to close an opening end of the spark plug 
mounting hole 4 by the rain cover 3. A vent channel 8 is formed between an outer peripheral surface of an upper 
end portion of the plug cap body 2 and an inner peripheral surface of the rain cover 
3, and an air vent aperture 9 is formed at an upper end of the rain cover 3 for 
communication between the vent channel 8 and the atmosphere. A spherical sealing member storage chamber 10 as a larger space is formed 
in an intermediate portion of the air vent aperture 9, and a sealing sphere 11 is 
received in the sealing member storage chamber 10. The sealing sphere 11 normally shuts off the communication through the air 
vent aperture 9 by gravity, and prevents water from entering the spark plug 
mounting hole 4 when water enters the sealing member storage chamber 10 from  
 
above by a high-pressure jet of water. When the temperature of the engine 5 rises and air in the spark plug mounting 
hole 4 thermally expands to increase the internal pressure, the expanded air pushes 
the movable sealing sphere 11 upwardly to escape outwardly. This prevents an 
increase in internal pressure of the spark plug mounting hole 4. However, the conventional structure is constructed such that water enters up 
to the sealing member storage chamber 10. When the spark plug mounting hole 
4 is disposed at a slant, the air vent aperture 9 is slanted as shown in Fig. 14 and 
the air vent aperture 9 is not shut off by gravity exerted upon the sealing sphere 11, 
resulting in water in the sealing member storage chamber 10 entering the spark plug 
mounting hole 4. According to the present invention, a plug cap device comprises: a tubular 
plug cap body removably inserted in a spark plug mounting hole formed adjacent 
an engine; a rain cover receiving an upper end portion of the plug cap body and 
closing an opening end of the spark plug mounting hole, the rain cover including 
an air vent aperture for communication between the spark plug mounting hole and 
atmosphere; and a sealing member
