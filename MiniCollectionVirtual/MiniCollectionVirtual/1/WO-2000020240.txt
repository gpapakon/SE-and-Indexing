<ABSTRACT>
In a vehicle air conditioning system an air heating device (11) is positioned upstream of an air cooling unit (13). Upstream heating is used to load the air temperature before the air reaches the air cooling unit (13) so as to consequently increase the heat flux across the air cooling unit (13). The external operational temperature window for the air conditioning cycle is consequently widened because the system is able to tolerate a lower ambient external air temperature range.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Vehicle Air ConditioningThe present invention relates to vehicle air conditioning.Vehicle air conditioning systems are known which comprise evaporators positioned to cool airflow upstream of heater units, which heater units are operable to add heat to the air downstream of the evaporator when required. The evaporator also acts as a de-humidifier for the air. Air is drawn in from the exterior of the vehicle, or recirculated from the vehicle cabin and directed through one or both of the evaporator and heater dependent upon the ambient conditions (such as the humidity or temperature of the air passing through the system) and the system requirements set by the passenger.The temperature difference between the refrigerant fluid in the evaporator and the air passing through the evaporator provides the driving mechanism which causes heat transfer to occur. The greater the ambient temperature, the greater is the heat flux between the ambient air and the evaporating medium; consequently the easier it is for the refrigerant to achieve the required enthalpy rise in the evaporator to effect full evaporation of the refrigerant. When ambient temperatures are low (such as in cold climates) achieving an enthalpy change sufficient for adequate evaporation of the refrigerant in the evaporator becomes a problem. A level is reached at which ambient air temperature is so low that complete evaporation is not possible. When this occurs, the system 

becomes increasingly inoperable because, amongst other things, incompressible (un-evaporated) refrigerant can enter the compressor driving the system.Attempts have been made to alleviate the above mentioned problems by directing heat from other sources to heat the refrigerant downstream of the evaporator.An improved arrangement has now been devised.According to the present invention, there is provided a vehicle air conditioning system comprising:i) an air cooling unit; and,ii) air heating means positioned upstream of the air cooling unit.The invention operates by utilising the upstream heating means to load the air temperature before the air reaches the air cooling unit so as to consequently increase the heat flux across the air cooling unit. The external operational temperature window for the air conditioning cycle is consequently widened because the system is able to tolerate a lower ambient external air temperature range. Furthermore the humidity control of the conditioned air may be improved.It is preferred that the air cooling unit comprises part of a refrigerant fluid
