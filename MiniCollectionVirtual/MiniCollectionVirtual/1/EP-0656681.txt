<ABSTRACT>
A system for supporting a retaining ring on an end 
of body portion of a rotor in an electrodynamic system includes 

an end wedge which is adapted to be in contact with 
a retaining ring, a damper bar having a first surface which 

abuts the end wedge member and a second, oppositely facing 
surface; and a filler block positioned between the second 

surface of the damper bar and a field winding portion of a 
rotor. The filler block has a tapered surface which 

defines a stress-reducing gap between the field winding 
portion and the retaining ring, so as to minimize stress in 

the slot cell and field windings during high-speed rotation 
of the rotor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and a
method for efficiently reconditioning a rotor end in an
electrical generator. More specifically, the invention
relates to an apparatus and a method for reconditioning a
body end portion of such a rotor that does not require
rewinding of the rotor.After prolonged periods of use, some generator
designs may require reconditioning for continued efficient
performance. Among the different components that may
require reconditioning is the end of the rotor body
portion of the generator rotor, which is subject to
stress-induced cracking at the top of the rotor winding
teeth.Typically, a long retaining ring attachment
modification is used to recondition severely cracked rotor
winding tooth tops. Such a modification, however, changes
the support of the copper windings, which in turn affects
the rotor slot cell. Many rotors are equipped with glass-epoxy-mica
slot cells, which tend to be susceptible to
cracking at high stresses. To protect against damage from
the additional stresses which may be created by the long
retaining ring modification, the rotor has typically been
rewound as part of the reconditioning process with more 
flexible Nomex slot cells. Unfortunately, the process of
rewinding the rotor is expensive and time consuming.A method for repairing a rotor is disclosed in
U.S. Patent 5,174,011 titled "Method For Preparing The
Rotor Of A Turbogenerator" issued December 29, 1992 in
the name of Klaus Weigelt. This patent discloses a
method of repairing a rotor having tooth top cracking,
wherein after removal of the rotor from the stator and
from the existing retaining rings, the winding is
protected with suitable cover materials, including
sealing the whole with paraffin. However, this patent
does not appear to disclose a suitable apparatus for
supporting the retaining ring on an end portion of the
rotor.It is clear that there has existed a long and
unfilled need in the prior art for an apparatus and method
for reconditioning end of the body portions of rotor
assemblies which is less expensive and time consuming than
systems and methods heretofore used.Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to
provide an improved apparatus and method for
reconditioning end of the body portions of generator rotor
assemblies which is less expensive and time consuming to
perform than methods heretofore known.In order to achieve the above and other objects
of the invention, an apparatus for supporting a retaining
ring on an end of the body portion of a rotor in an
electrodynamic

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for supporting a retaining ring
(18) on an field winding portion of a rotor (40) in an

electrodynamic system, comprising an end wedge member (30)
which is adapted to contact a retaining ring (18); a

damper bar (28) having a first surface which abuts said
end wedge member (30) and a second, oppositely facing

surface; and a filler block (44) positioned between said
second surface of said damper bar (28) and a field winding

portion of a rotor (40), characterized by said filler
block (44) having a tapered surface which defines a

stress-relieving gap (52) between the field winding
portion and the retaining ring (18).
The apparatus according to claim 1, further
characterized in that said tapered surface is positioned

adjacent to said second surface of said damper bar (28),
said stress-relieving gap (52) thereby being defined

between said damper bar (28) and said filler block (44).
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
said end wedge member (30) is constructed and arranged to

connect to a nose fit portion of the retaining ring (18).
The apparatus according to claim 3, wherein
said end wedge member (30) is constructed and arranged to

be keyed to the nose fit portion of the retaining ring
(18).
The apparatus according to claim 1, further
comprising an end filler block (58) adjacent to said

filler block (44), said end filler block (58) being 
positioned between a counterturn portion of the retaining

ring (18) and the field winding portion of the rotor (40).
The apparatus according to claim 5, further
characterized in that said end filler block (58) is

tapered so as to define a second stress-relieving gap (60)
between the counterturn portion of the retaining ring (18)

and the field winding portion of the rotor (40).
A method for making a retaining ring (18)
attachment to the end of a body portion of a rotor (40) in

an electrodynamic system, characterized by the steps of:

(a) positioning a filler block (44) adjacent to
an field winding of a rotor (40), said filler block (44)

having a tapered surface;
(b) fitting an end wedge member (30) over said
filler block (44);
(c) inserting a shim between said end wedge
member (30) and said filler block (44) to fill a gap which

is defined between said members as a result of said
tapered surface;
(d) machining an outer surface of said end wedge
member (30) to a dimension which is adapted to fit a nose

fit portion of a retaining ring (18);
(e) removing the shim; and
(f) positioning the end wedge member (30)
adjacent to the nose fit portion of the retaining ring

(18), whereby the gap defined between the end wedge member
(30) and the filler block (44) will relieve stress between

the field winding portion and the retaining ring (18)
during operation of the electrodynamic system.
