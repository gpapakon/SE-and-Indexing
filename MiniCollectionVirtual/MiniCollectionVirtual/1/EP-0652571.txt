<ABSTRACT>
An electrical cable has a conductor (1) made of alkali metal and a sheath (2) for air-tight and waterproof screening of the alkali metal conductor (1) from the environment. The cable is equipped with a non-metallic reinforcing structure which is preferably in direct contact with the alkali metal conductor (1). The cable assembly containing an alkali metal conductor (1) is distinguished by relatively low weight and high strength with a low electrical resistance. It can be used as an overhead cable or, after suitable adaptation, as an underground cable as well.
