<ABSTRACT>
Tube laminate comprising at least the following layers     a) a polyethylene film of a thickness of 60 to 200  mu m   b) a lamination c) a supporting film of a thickness of 8 to 30  mu m, coated with a ceramic layer of a thickness of 5 to 500 nm (nanometres), directed towards layer d),   d) an ionomer layer of a thickness of 20 to 40  mu m,   e) an intermediate film of a thickness of 8 to 30  mu m   f) a lamination and   g) a polyethylene film of a thickness of 60 to 200  mu m.   The tube laminate is produced in three operations, in a first operation the layer g) being bonded by means of extrusion lamination with a layer e), forming a layer f), and an ionomer layer d) being applied to the layer e), and in a second operation a layer c), which is precoated with a ceramic layer, being applied to the layer d), and in a third operation a laminating layer b) and the layer a) being applied to the layer c).

Process for the production of a tube laminate comprising at least the following
layers:


a) a polyethylene film having a thickness of 60 to 200 µm,
b) a laminate,
c) a supporting film having a thickness of 8 to 30 µm, coated with a ceramic layer
having a thickness of 5 to 500 nm (nanometres) on the side directed towards

layer d),
d) an ionomer layer having a thickness of 20 to 40 µm,
e) an intermediate film having a thickness of 8 to 30 µm
f) a laminate, and
g) a polyethylene film having a thickness of 60 to 200 µm,

characterised in that, in a first step, the layer g), a polyethylene film having a
thickness of 60 to 200 µm, is laminated by extrusion lamination or lacquer

lamination with the formation of a laminate f) on the side directed towards the layer
e), the intermediate film having a thickness of 8 to 30 µm and the layer d), an

ionomer layer having a thickness of 20 to 40 µm, is applied to the layer e) by
calendering, coating or lacquer lamination and is processed to form a first partial

composite and, in a second step, the layer c), a supporting layer which is coated on
the side directed towards the layer d) with a ceramic layer having a thickness of 5 to

500 nm, is applied to this first composite, to the ionomer layer d), and is thus
processed to form a second partial composite and, in a third step, an extrusion

laminate or lacquer laminate is applied to the layer c) with the formation of the layer
b), and the layer a), a polyethylene film having a thickness of 60 to 200 µm, is

applied to the layer b).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that, in the second step, the first
partial composite from the first step is joined to the layer c) by means of the layer

d), the ionomer layer, by calendering, preferably by hot calendering, or lamination,
preferably by the application of a lacquer, the layer c) running without tension.
