<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method and device for removing particles, in particular soot particles, from exhaust gases produced by internal-combustion engines. The invention calls for the particles to be electrostatically charged by an electrode (4). The particles or particle agglomerates are trapped by a fine-mesh metal filter (5). The conducting material (5a), preferably a sintered ferritic metal, of which the filter (5) is made can also be used as a collecting electrode. A high voltage (6) is applied (7, 10) to the electrodes. At intervals, preferably at regular intervals, an electric current is passed (11, 12) through the filter (5), causing the filter material (5a) to heat up to a temperature above the ignition temperature of the particles. The preferred shape of the filter surface is a cylinder, truncated cone and/or cone.

Method of removing particles, in particular soot 
particles, from the exhaust-gas stream of internal 

combustion engines, the particles being charged electrostatically 
by means of at least one electrode (4) and in 

some cases forming agglomerates, and the particles or 
particle agglomerates being removed by means of one or 

more filters (5), characterized in that a sintered-metal 
fine filter (5) having at least one precipitation 

electrode (5a) has exhaust gas flowing through it even 
during the regeneration and in that, for the purpose of 

regeneration, an electrical current is intermittently 
passed through the laden fine filter (5) and the fine 

filter (5) is thereby heated above the ignition temperature 
of the particles. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the filter material (5a) of the fine filter (5) 

itself serves as a precipitation electrode (5a). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a ferritic sintered metal is used as 

fine-filter material (5a).
