<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method making it possible to generate, using data-processing techniques, models for simulators. A given set of data pairs, such as those which can be obtained from a data sheet, is automatically interpolated. Kinks in slope and extreme points in the curves thus obtained can be explicitly programmed. The method proposed makes shorter simulation times possible and give more precise results.
