<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to compounds of the formula 
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used in formula I, and 
throughout the specification, the symbols have the following meanings:
 
   X is O, S or NCN;
 
   R¹ is aryl or heterocyclo;
 
   R² is hydrogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, 
arylalkyl, (cycloalkyl)alkyl, -CN, -NO₂, -COR, -COOR, -CONHR, 
-CONR⁵, -CF₃, -S-alkyl, -SOalkyl, -SO₂alkyl, halogen, amino, substituted 
amino, hydroxy, -O-alkyl, -OCF₃, -OCH₂CF₃, -OCOalkyl, -OCONRalkyl, 
-NRCOalkyl, -NRCOOalkyl or -NRCONR⁵, where R is hydrogen, alkyl, 
haloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkyl;
 
   R³ and R⁴ are independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or arylalkyl; 
or R³ and R⁴ taken together with the carbon atom to which they are 
attached form a 3- to 7-membered carbocyclic ring;
 
   R⁵ is hydrogen, hydroxy or -OCOR; and
 
   n is 0 or the integer 1 or 2. The compounds of this invention possess potassium channel 
opening activity and are useful, for example as cardiovascular agents.  The present invention provides for compounds of formula I, 
pharmaceutical compositions employing such compounds and for methods 
of using such compounds. Listed below are definitions of various terms 
used to describe the compounds of the instant invention. These definitions 
apply to the terms as they are used throughout the specification (unless 
they are otherwise limited in specific instances either individually or as 
part of a larger group. The term "alkyl" refers to both straight and branched chain groups 
having 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the normal chain, preferably 1 to 5 carbons, 
such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, the 
various branched chain isomers thereof, such as isopropyl, t-butyl, 
isobutyl, isohexyl, 4,4-dimethylpentyl, 2,2,4-trimethylpentyl and the like 
as well as such groups including a halo substituent such as CCl₃ or CF₃, 
an alkoxy substituent, an aryl substituent, an alkylaryl substituent, a 
haloaryl substituent, a cycloalkyl substituent, a (cycloalkyl)alkyl 
substituent, a hydroxy substituent, an alkylamino substituent, an 
alkanoylamino substituent, an arylcarbonylamino substituent, a nitro 
substituent, a cyano substituent, a thiol substituent or an alkylthio 
substituent. The term "alkoxy" refers to any of the above alkyl groups linked to 
an oxygen atom. The term "alkylthio" refers to any of the above alkyl groups linked 
to a sulfur atom. The term "alkenyl" refers to any of the above alkyl groups
