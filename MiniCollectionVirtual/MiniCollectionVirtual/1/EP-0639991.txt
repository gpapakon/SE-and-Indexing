<ABSTRACT>
An injection cartridge of the dual-chamber type has a bypass connection between its two chambers which is arranged such that the interior wall of the cartridge is modified in a determined area in such a way that the movable wall between the two chambers does not seal completely against the interior wall in said area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an injection cartridge
of the dual-chamber type. In more detail, the invention
refers to an injection cartridge of the dual-chamber
type which has an improved arrangement of bypass
means for the liquid component.Injection cartridges of the dual-chamber type are
well-known and have found a wide use. Such cartridges
are primarily intended to be used when the liquid pharmaceutical
composition to be injected is not stable for
any extended period of time. In such cases, the composition
to be injected is provided as two separate components,
one solid component comprising the active
pharmaceutical component in a dry state, and one liquid
component comprising a solvent or dispersing agent for
the solid component. These two components are enclosed
in an injection cartridge of the dual-chamber type,
such that the solid component is usually enclosed in a
front chamber, while the liquid component is enclosed
in a rear chamber. (In the following specification and
claims, the expressions "front" and "rear" are to be
regarded in relation to the direction in which the
injectable composition is transported when an injection
is administered.)The two components are separated by a movable wall
which seals against the interior wall of the cartridge.
The rear chamber, which contains the liquid component,
is also closed at its rear end by a piston which seals
against the interior wall of the cartridge.At its front end, the cartridge is usually closed by
a rubber septum which is held into place by a metal
capsule. This metal capsule has a central opening which
exposes the rubber septum. Through this opening, a
hollow needle may be inserted through this the septum
to give a connection with the interior of the cartridge.For conducting the liquid component over to the solid 
component for dissolution or dispersion, conventional
dual-chamber injection cartridges are provided with at
least one bypass channel in the wall of the cartridge.
When the movable wall which separates the two chambers
is at a suitable position, the bypass channel is
exposed, so that the liquid component may flow around
said movable wall and be mixed with the solid component.When the cartridge is to be readied for the administering
of one or more injections, pressure is applied
to the rear piston to urge it forward. This pressure
will be transmitted through the liquid phase, which is
largely incompressible, so that also the movable wall,
which separates the two chambers, is urged forward.
When front movable wall has been moved
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An injection cartridge of the dual-chamber type, comprising a tubular barrel (1)
which at its front end (3) is sealed by a closure (4,5) which may be penetrated by an

outlet conduit for a liquid preparation from the cartridge, and at its rear end is closed by a
piston (8) which may be moved forward, and a movable transversal wall (11) inside said

barrel (1), said movable wall (11) dividing the cartridge into two separate chambers
(9,10), and a bypass connection (12) between the two chambers (9,10), said bypass

connection (12) being openable by the displacement of said movable wall (11) to permit a
bypass flow of liquid between the two chambers (9,10), said

connection (12) between the two chambers (9,10) being arranged as a modification of the
surface of the interior wall of the barrel (1), said modification comprising a plurality of

lands (23) and grooves (13,24) which are distributed along the circumference of the
interior wall

and said grooves (13,24) extending outward from the nominal interior circumference
(26) of the barrel (1),

characterized in that said lands (23) extend inward from said nominal interior circumference
(26) of the barrel (1)

and that the movable wall (11), when in the bypass connection
(12), is deformed by said lands (23) without completely filling up said grooves (24).
An injection cartridge according to claim 1, characterized in that the height of the
lands (23) and the depth of the grooves (24), as well as their number, are correlated in

such a way that the movable transversal wall (11) has essentially the same cross-sectional
area when it is positioned in the area (12) of said lands (23) and grooves (24) as when it

is positioned in the smooth-walled part of the barrel(1).
An injection cartridge according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said
modification consists of a pattern of roughened surface or of small projections in the

interior surface of said barrel (1).
An injection cartridge according to any one of claims 1-3, characterized in that
said modified area (12) of the surface of the interior wall is divided into at least two

spaced circumferential areas (15,16), and that the movable wall (11) is provided with the 
same number of peripheral sealing ridges (17,18), said ridges and said areas having the

same spacing.
An injection cartridge according to any one of claims 1-4, characterized in that
the depth of said grooves (13,24) and/or the height of said lands (23) or projections is

between 0.06 and 0.6 mm.
