<ABSTRACT>
A strapping tool (10) of a type used to apply a steel 
strap (12) in a tensioned loop around a package (14) and to 

join the strap via a series of interlocking joints (16) 
comprising interlockable shoulders punched into overlapped 

ends of the strap (12) includes a base (60) extending 
longitudinally and defining a pair of recesses (70, 72). 

A frame (78) upstanding from the base (68) is mounted 
integrally to the base (68). In a mechanism for admitting 

the overlapped ends of the strap into the tool, for 
retaining the overlapped ends, and for releasing the 

overlapped ends from the tool, a pair of latches (100, 106) 
having hooked ends (102, 108) are mounted pivotably to the 

base (68) so as to be pivotable between closed positions 
wherein the latches (100, 106) are positioned with the 

hooked ends (102, 108) extending into the recesses (70, 72) 
to retain the overlapped ends between the latch (100, 106) 

and the base (68) and between the hooked ends (102, 108) 
and the frame (78) and an open positions wherein the 

latches are displaced angularly from their closed position 
to admit the overlapped ends into the tool (10) and to 

release the overlapped ends from the tool (10). The 
latches (100, 106) are biased into their closed position. 

Co-acting elements including a lever (70), which can be 
manually squeezed toward an actuating handle (40) of the 

strapping tool (10), and a camming member (120), which is 
arranged to cam the latches (100, 106), are provided for 

pivoting the latches (100, 106) from their closed position 
into their open position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a strapping tool of a type 
used to apply a steel-strap in a tensioned loop around a 
package and to join the strap via a series of interlocking 
joints comprising interlockable shoulders punched into 
overlapped ends of the strap. In a strapping tool of the type noted above, an 
actuating handle is provided, which is arranged to be 
manually oscillated. The handle rotates an output shaft, 
which actuates a series of cams, via an input shaft, to 
which the handle is coupled, and intermediate gears. The 
cams drive a series of punches, which punch interlockable 
shoulders into overlapped ends of the strap. Tremper et 
al. U.S. Patent No. 4,825,512 provides a recent example of 
such a strap having such a series of interlocking joints. As disclosed in Nix U.S. Patent No. 5,136,888, a 
strapping tool of the type noted above may incorporate a 
mechanism for converting oscillatory rotation of the input 
shaft to uni-directional rotation of the output shaft. EP-0,091,578 discloses a strapping tool in accordance with the 
preamble of claim 1 which includes 
a hooked-shaped rocking lever for admitting overlapped ends 
of the strap into the tool, for retaining the overlapped 
ends, and for releasing the overlapped ends from the tool. This invention improves a strapping tool of the type 
noted above. The strapping tool is used to apply a steel 
strap in a tensioned loop around a package and to join the 
strap via a series of interlocking joints comprising 
interlockable shoulders punched into overlapped ends of the 
strap. The strapping tool comprises a fixed structure, 
which includes a base extending longitudinally and a frame 
upstanding from the base, and a mechanism for admitting the 
over-lapped ends of the strap into the tool, for retaining 
the overlapped ends, and for releasing the overlapped ends 
from the tool, the mechanism including a latch having a  
 
hooked end, the latch being mounted pivotably so 
as to be selectively pivotable between a closed position 
wherein the latch retains the overlapped ends and an open 
position wherein the latch is angularly displaced from the closed 
position to admit the overlapped ends into the tool and to 
release the overlapped ends from the tool, the latch being 
biased into the closed position, the mechanism further 
including a lever for moving the latch from the closed 
position into the open position, and is characterised in 
that the latch is mounted pivotably to the base, 
in that 
the mechanism further comprises an elongate

A strapping tool (10) for applying a steel strap (12) 
in a tensioned loop around a package and to join the strap 

(12) via a series of interlocking joints (16) comprising 
interlockable shoulders punched into overlapped ends of the 

strap (12), the strapping tool (10) comprising a fixed 
structure, which includes a base (68) extending 

longitudinally and a frame (78) upstanding from the base, 
and a mechanism (100, 106) for admitting the over-lapped 

ends of the strap (12) into the tool (10), for retaining 
the overlapped ends, and for releasing the overlapped ends 

from the tool (10), the mechanism including a latch (100, 
106) having a hooked end (102, 108), the latch being 

mounted pivotably so as to be selectively 
pivotable between a closed position wherein the latch retains 

the overlapped ends and an open position wherein the latch 
(100, 106) is angularly displaced from the closed position to admit 

the overlapped ends into the tool (10) and to release the 
overlapped ends from the tool, the latch (100, 106) being 

biased into the closed position, the mechanism further 
including a lever (80) for moving the latch (100, 106) from 

the closed position into the open position, characterised 
in that the latch (100,106) is mounted pivotably to the 

base (68), 
in that the mechanism further 

comprises an elongate camming member (120) mounted movably to the 
frame (78) so as to be longitudinally movable between an 

advanced position corresponding to the closed position of 
the latch (100, 106) and a retracted position corresponding 

to the open position of the latch (100, 106), the camming 
member (120) having a cam slot (122, 124) co-acting with 

a camming end (104, 110) of the latch (100, 106) so as to pivot the latch (100, 106)  
 

from the closed position into the open position upon 
longitudinal movement of the camming member (120) from the 

advanced position into the retracted position and so as to 
pivot the latch (100, 106) from the open position into the 

closed position upon longitudinal movement of the camming 
member (120) from the retracted position into the advanced 

position, in that in the closed position the latch retains 
the overlapped ends between the latch (100, 106) and the 

base (68) and between the hooked end (102, 108) of the 
latch (100, 106) and the frame (68), and in that the lever 

(80) is linked to the camming member in such manner that 
pivoting of the lever (80) from the latching position into 

the unlatching position results in longitudinal movement of 
the camming member (120) from the advanced position into 

the retracted position, the camming member (120) being 
biased into the advanced position so as to bias the lever 

(80) into the latching position.

movement, between a forward limit of the range and a 

reverse limit of the range, the handle (40) being 
positioned near the lever (80), when the handle (40) is 

positioned at the reverse limit of its range, so as to 
permit a user to pivot the lever (80) from the latching 

position into the unlatching position by grasping the 
handle (40) and the lever (80) using only one hand and by 

squeezing the lever (80) toward the handle (40).

the axis about which the lever (80) is pivotable is a 

transverse axis, and wherein the mechanism further 
comprises a transverse member (52) spaced from the

axis as the lever (80) is pivoted about the transverse 

axis, the camming member (120) having another cam surface  
 

(126) co-acting with the transverse member (52) in such 
manner that the transverse member (52) moves the camming 

member (120) from the advanced position into the retracted 
position upon pivoting of the lever (80) from the latching 

position into the unlatching position. 
A strapping tool according to any one of the preceding 
claims, in which the mechanism includes a pair of latches
