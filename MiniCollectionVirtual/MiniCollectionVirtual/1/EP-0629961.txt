<ABSTRACT>
A data conversion apparatus and method for 
translating information stored in a first relational 

database to that stored in a second relational database, 
and for translating information in a relational database 

used by a first selected version of a computer program into 
information stored in a second relational database for use 

by a second selected version of a computer program. The 
apparatus and method thus allow the sharing of data by 

computer systems (12, 24) running different versions of a 
given software package, for example. The data conversion 

apparatus includes a first file storage element (26) for 
storing a first relational database having a plurality of 

digital records representing information used by a first 
selected version of a computer program, and a second file 

storage element (38) capable of storing a second relational 
database representing at least a portion of the information 

from the first database for use by a second selected 
version of the computer program. The apparatus further 

includes a file management element (28, 30) that converts 
information from the first database for storage in the  

 
second. That conversion is performed as a function of the 

identities of the first and second selected versions of the 
computer program. The file management element includes 

table entry elements (52A-52E) that identify, in table-like 
form, the procedures for translating individual records or 

fields of information stored in the first relational 
database into a form compatible with the second computer 

program version. Each file management table entry (52A-52E) 
stores the names of software subroutines, each of 

which executes steps necessary for converting data between 
the respective formats.

<DESCRIPTION>
A portion of the disclosure of this patent document includes
Appendices A,B and C filed at the European Patent Office with this
application which contain material subject to copyright protection. The
copyright owner has no objection to facsimile reproduction by anyone of the
patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the European
Patent Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright
rights whatsoever.This invention relates to the conversion of digital data transferred between relational
databases and more particularly, for example, to the conversion of data transferred between
computer systems running different versions of the same software. The invention finds
particular application with the transfer of data between databases, for
example relational databases.A localized working environment with multiple computer systems typically runs a
single version of any given software package, thereby making simple the transfer and sharing
of data between the systems. Thus, for example, a company that uses computers to monitor
and control manufacturing operations at a single site will generally run the very same
computer-aided manufacturing software package on each of its computers. In the event data
is transferred from one of those systems, it need not be converted for use on another system.In a non-localized environment, however, sharing of data between multiple computer
systems can be problematic. Companies having geographically diverse facilities may run
different versions of a given software package at each site. For example, a multinational
company may employ a first version of a software package in connection with its operations
in France, while using a second version of that same package for its operations at a sister
facility in Germany. While it may be desirable to transfer data between these facilities,
differences in the structure of the underlying data files may make such a transfer difficult if
not virtually impossible.According to one prior art solution, data transferred between computer systems (e.g.,
between the French and German sites) would be printed at one site and manually re-entered at
the other. This results in time delay, loss of man-hours and a corresponding loss in
productivity. According to another such solution, a programmer would be employed to write
a special-purpose computer to convert records used at one site to those used at the other site. 
The difficulties in finding a programmer with sufficient knowledge of the data structures and
