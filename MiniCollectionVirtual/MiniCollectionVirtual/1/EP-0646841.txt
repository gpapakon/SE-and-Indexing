<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a photographic process 
and element where the element comprises a light 

sensitive silver halide layer containing (1) an image 
dye-forming bicyclic azole coupler having bonded to the 

coupling site a group other than hydrogen which is 
cleavable during the development process; (2) an 

azopyrazolone masking coupler; and (3) a stabilizing 
coupler having bonded to the coupling site only 

hydrogen atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic 
elements containing a bicyclic azole coupler and an 
azopyrazolone masking coupler used to correct for 
unwanted absorption in color negative film. More 
particularly, it relates to such elements containing a 
stabilizing coupler having bonded to the coupling site 
only hydrogen atoms and/or carbon atoms which are not 
cleavable to permit dye formation during development. The use of 4-phenylazopyrazolone masking 
couplers is known in the art. See, for example, U.S. 
2,428,034; U.S. 2,434,272; U.S. 2,455,170; U.S. 
2,688,539; U.S. 2,704,711; U.S. 2,808,329; U.S. 
3,476,560; U.S. 3,796,574; U.S. 4,427,763; U.S. 
4,777,123, and EP 213,490; as well as those identified 
in Research Disclosure December 1989, Section VII, Part 
G, Publiched by Kenneth Mason Publications, Ltd., 
Dudley Annex, 12A North Street, Emworth, Hampshire PO10 
7DQ, England. These compounds have proven useful since 
they are, subsequent to development, typically yellow 
colored in nonexposed areas and magenta colored in 
exposed areas. Thus, when in reality the magenta dye 
formed in a color negative photographic process has a 
small but significant unwanted absorption in the blue 
range, this may be balanced somewhat by the relative 
loss of blue absorption due to conversion of the mask 
color from yellow to magenta in the exposed areas. 
Then, an adjustment can be made to the spectral content 
of the light used to produce the positive from the 
negative to effectively cancel out the unwanted blue  
 
absorption, which is now relatively constant across 
both the exposed and unexposed areas of the negative. While phenylazopyrazolone masking couplers 
have been employed as a means of offsetting the 
unwanted blue absorption of conventional magenta 
couplers, this means for improving the color rendition 
has now been found to be responsible for the 
degradation during raw stock keeping of bicyclic azole 
image couplers with corresponding losses in contrast, 
optical density and related photographic 
characteristics. The presence of these masking 
couplers results in the degradation and loss of image 
coupler. This is thought to be due to an undesired 
reaction in the raw stock prior to development between 
the masking coupler and undesired oxidants. The 
unwanted degradation of the image coupler eventually 
results in the loss of density in the photographic 
image. It is undesirable to have a film where the 
image density will vary with the length of raw stock 
storage time. European Patent
