Process for recovering an enzyme mixture (laccase,
polyphenoloxidase), which mainly transforms phenols,

polyphenols and their derivatives, from the fruit bodies
of fungi or parts of fruit bodies of fungi, characterised

in that the latter are coarsely comminuted (slices having
a thickness 
>
 2 mm, diameter 
>
 2 mm) and agitated in
potassium phosphate buffer (maximum 1 M, pH 3 - 9), the

enzyme emission is measured and after reaching maximum
enzyme activity the supernatant is separated off and

stored as a useful enzyme product.
Process for recovering an enzyme mixture (laccase,
polyphenoloxidase), which mainly transforms phenols,

polyphenols and their derivatives, from the substrate
mycelium mixture or submerged mycelium of fungi or parts

of the substrate mycelium mixture or submerged mycelium
of fungi, characterised in that the latter are coarsely

comminuted (slices having a thickness 
>
 2 mm, diameter 
>

2 mm) and agitated in potassium phosphate buffer (maximum
1 M, pH 3 - 9), the enzyme emission is measured and after

reaching maximum enzyme activity the supernatant is
separated off and stored as a useful enzyme product.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that an inductor which increases the enzyme yield is

added to the potassium phosphate buffer.
Process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in
that the inductor is lignin or a phenolic fragment of

lignin, such as for example Braun's lignin,
protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, ferulaic acid.
Process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in
that the inductor is vanillic acid. 
Process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in
that a phenol-containing foodstuff or waste products, for

example black tea extract, is used as the inductor.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that a tannin-binding substance, for

example casein or casein peptone, is added to the buffer.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that copper salts, such as for example

CuSO
4
, are added to the buffer to cover the copper
requirement of the enzyme.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the fruit bodies or their parts are

also used in the frozen state.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that an edible fungus, for example

Agaricus bisporus (cultivated mushroom), is used as the
enzyme source.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that only certain parts of the fruit

body, for example stalks, are used.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that enzyme preparations, for example

chitinase, are added to improve enzyme recovery and
yield.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 12,
characterised in that a preservative, for example

ascorbic acid, Na-methyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate, alcohols,
polyalcohols, potassium sorbate or the like, are added to

the enzyme product thus obtained to improve the shelf
life. 
Process according to one of claims 1 to 13,
characterised in that ethanol is used as the

preservative.
Process according to one of claims 1 to 4 and 5 to
14, characterised in that vanillic acid is used as

additional stabiliser.
Process according to one of claims 1, 3, 4 and 13 to
15, characterised in that preservation is carried out by

means of spray-drying.
Process according to one of claims 1, 3, 4 and 13 to
15, characterised in that the enzyme is fixed to a

matrix.
Process according to one of claims 1 3, 4 and 13 to
15, characterised in that the enzyme is recovered or

stored with exclusion of oxygen, for example in a
nitrogen atmosphere.
Process according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised by the addition of hexose, in particular

mannose.
Enzyme mixture which can be obtained by a process
according to one of the preceding claim.
