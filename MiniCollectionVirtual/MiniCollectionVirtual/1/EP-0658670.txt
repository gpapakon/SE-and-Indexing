<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a key (10) comprising an elongate key body (11), one end (12) of which is connected to a gripping head (16) of the key (10), characterised in that the said end (12) of the key body (11) is connected to the gripping head (16) by connection means (54) which can be cut in the event of shocks on the gripping head (16) of the key (10). The invention is used for producing an ignition key, the gripping head of which consists of a housing for the remote control of the opening of the openable parts of a motor vehicle.

Key (10), notably a motor vehicle ignition key, having an elongate key body
(11), one end of which (12, 54) is connected to a gripping head (16) of the key (10),

the said end (12, 54) of the key body (11) being connected to the gripping head (16)
by connecting means (54, 56) which can be broken in the event of impact on the

gripping head (16) of the key (10), the said breakable connecting means consisting of
removable connecting means (54, 36), the gripping head (16) having an open housing

(36) in which there is received an end portion (54) of the key body (11) with shapes
complementary to those of the housing (36) in the gripping head (16), the end

portion (54) of the key body (11) being nested elastically in the housing (36) in the
gripping head (16) in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal direction of

the key body (11), characterised in that the housing (36) has an overall rectangular
parallelepipedal shape, one face of which is open and the base (38) of which has a

groove (48) which receives a complementary rib (76) formed on the transverse end
face (66) of the end portion (54) of the key body (11).
Key according to Claim 1, characterised in that one of the lateral faces (42) of
the housing (36) has a groove (50) which receives a complementary rib (78), parallel

to the longitudinal direction of the key body (11), formed on the facing lateral face
(68) of the end portion (54) of the key body (11).
Key according to Claim 2, characterised in that the two grooves (48, 50) extend
in the same mid-plane of the housing (36) parallel to the principal plane of the key

body (11, 14).
Key according to Claim 3, characterised in that the two ribs (76, 78) are in line
with each other. 
Key according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that each of
the two parallel lateral faces (72, 74) of the end portion (54) of the key body (11) has

a rounded bulge whose axis is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the key
body (11), and in that each of the two opposite parallel lateral faces (44, 46) of the

housing (36) has a complementary rounded cavity.
Key according to Claim 5 taken in combination with one of Claims 3 or 4,
characterised in that the bulges are formed on the lateral faces (72, 74) of the end

portion (54) of the key body (11) parallel to the principal plane of the latter (11).
Key according to one of Claims 5 or 6, characterised in that one of the lateral
walls of the housing (36) on the internal face (46) of which (52) a rounded cavity is

formed is elastically deformable.
Key according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
said end portion (54) of the key body (11) consists of a piece moulded from plastic

material (54) attached to the said end (12) of the key body (11).
Key according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
gripping head (16) of the key (10) is a box for the remote electrical control of the

opening and closure of the doors of a motor vehicle.
