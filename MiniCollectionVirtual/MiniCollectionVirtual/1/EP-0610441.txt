<DESCRIPTION>
 CROSSLINKABLE POLYSACCHARIDES, POLYCATIONS AND LIPIDS USEFUL FOR ENCAPSULATION AND DRUG RELEASEThis application is a Continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/784,267 filed October 29, 1991, now pending.The present invention relates to a new form of biocompatible materials (including lipids, polycations, and polysaccharides) which are capable of undergoing free radical polymerization. The invention also relates to methods of modifying certain synthetic and naturally occurring biocompatible materials to make polymerizable microcapsules containing biological material. The invention also relates to composites of said polymerizable materials, methods of making microcapsules and encapsulating biological materials therein, and apparatus for making microcapsules containing biological cells. The present invention also relates to drug delivery systems relating to the foregoing, and bioadhesives and wound dressings made utilizing the foregoing technology.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONOver the past 10 to 15 years various combinations of ionic polymers have been tested and utilized for microencapsulation of live cells and tissues. The most widely accepted material of the prior art is polylysine alginate, particular for in vivo applications. (Dupuy, 1988; Chang, 1984; Braun, 1985; Goosen, 1985, Darquy, 1985) . However, these polymers are water soluble in the form known in the prior art, and therefore have been considered to be of limited long-term stability.Polysaccharides such as alginates have been used extensively in recent years in the food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries (Smidsrød andSkjak-Braek, 1990) . In the pharmaceutical and biomedical 

 industries, their gel forming properties in the presence of ultivalent cations have been exploited for the icroencapsulation of cells and tissue and controlled release of drugs.It is the combination of multivalent (generally divalent) cations, such as calcium, with the alginate, which provides the mechanical stability of the ionically crosslinked gel. However, in the physiological environment (e.g., in the transplantation of microencapsulated islets or for drug release) extracellular concentrations of monovalent cations (such as sodium ions) exceed the concentration of divalent cations (such as calcium) . Under such conditions, these gels tend to lose their mechanical stability over the long term due to diffusion, leading to exchange of divalent cations for monovalent cations in the physiological fluid.In an effort to improve the mechanical stability
