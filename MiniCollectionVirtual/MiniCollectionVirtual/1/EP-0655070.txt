<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to triantennary cluster
glycosides, i.e., compounds which contain a cluster of three
sugar groups and thereby can be recognized by certain
receptors present in the human or animal liver.Such triantennary cluster glycosides can be used for
different purposes, for instance, if the triantennary cluster
glycoside comprises a cholesterol residue or an alternative
lipophilic group, for the in vivo delivery of lipoproteins and
lipid vesicles from the blood to the liver within the
framework of a therapeutic treatment of hyperlipidemia.Ways of piloting lipoproteins and lipid vesicles to the
liver via a suitable route have been searched for before, on
the one hand to create a transport vehicle that directs drugs
specifically to the liver and, on the other hand, to remove
the atherogenic low density lipoprotein (LDL) from the
bloodstream.Glycolipids have been developed in order to induce liver
uptake of lipid vesicles or lipoproteins via the
asialoglycoprotein receptor on the parenchymal cell of the
liver, such as cholesteryl glycosides (refs. 1-4) lactosyl
cerebrosides and gangliosides (refs. 5-9) and chemically
modified phospholipids (refs. 10-11).However, when associated to lipoproteins/liposomes, these
known compounds will display preference for uptake by the
likewise galactose recognizing fucose/galactose receptor on
hepatic Kupffer cells, which hampers a potential application
of these compounds in drug-targeting. The fucose/galactose
receptor binds sugars, glycoproteins and particles, exposing a
high density of terminal galactose groups (ref.22). Probably,
high affinity binding does not essentially require di-, tri-
or tetraantennarity of the glycoside. The afore-mentioned glycolipids contain a ligand which is
recognized by the asialoglycoprotein receptor on the
parenchymal cell of the liver. This receptor represents an
uptake system of high capacity and a unique localization on
the parenchymal cell of the liver. The receptor can recognize
sugars and glycoproteins with terminal galactose groups, it
having a clear preference for oligoantennary sugars.The above-mentioned compounds further comprise a
structure which provides for an association of the ligand to
lipid vesicles or lipoproteins. To that end, the substances
are provided with a lipid part which associates spontaneously
with lipid vesicles or lipoproteins.A disadvantage of these known glycolipids is inter alia
that they are not water-soluble, which makes the in vivo use
of these substances difficult.For this reason research has
