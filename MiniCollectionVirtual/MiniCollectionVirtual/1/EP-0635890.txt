<ABSTRACT>
In forming a thin film transistor (620) whose OFF-current characteristics are improved, the source and drain 
regions (602 and 603) of low impurity concentration are formed. In this process, all the ions (indicated by arrow 

Ion-1) of around 80 keV energy produced from a mixed gas (doping gas) containing 5% PH₃ and the rest of H₂ gas, 
are implanted into a polycrystalline silicon film (604) so that the concentration of impurities in a range of 3 x 10¹³/cm² 

to 1 x 10¹⁴/cm² in terms of P⁺ ions. Then all the ions (indicated by arrow Ion-2) of about 20 keV energy produced 
from a doping gas of pure hydrogen are implanted into a low concentration region (604a) so that the concentration of 

impurities is in a range of 1 x 10¹⁴/cm² to 1 x 10¹⁵/cm² in terms of H⁺ ions. After that, the impurities are activated 
by thermally treating the low concentration region (604a) in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of approximately 

300 °C for approximately one hour.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an active matrix circuit board, and method of manufacturing it,
and relates particularly to a technology improving the electrical characteristics of the thin-film
transistor.Thin-film transistors (hereafter "TFT") using a polycrystalline silicon film are used as pixel transistors
in liquid crystal display panels and other active matrix circuit boards. Of available liquid
crystal display panels, built-in drive circuit type (built-in peripheral circuit type) active matrix
circuit boards in which the drive circuit is formed using TFT in the area peripheral to the pixel
area are used in liquid crystal display panels for viewfinders and projectors due to the packaging
technology problem that making electrical connections to narrow pitch terminals is difficult. As
a result, TFT for the drive circuit area and TFT for the pixel area are both formed on a single
active matrix circuit board.Of these TFT, a low OFF current is required in the TFT of the pixel area so that the charge
written through the pixel electrodes can be held. Polycrystalline silicon TFT, however, may use
an offset gate structure wherein a source-drain area is provided at a position separated from the
edge of the gate electrodes because the OFF current is high.In addition, a low concentration area may be provided at the edge of the drain area, and a drain
structure (LDD structure) used with the field strength in this area reduced.The following manufacturing method is conventionally used to manufacture thin-film transistors
with such a structure.When n-channel type TFT 1200a in the drive circuit area, p-channel type TFT 1200b in the drive
circuit area, and n-channel type TFT 1200c in the pixel area are formed as shown in Fig. 23 (a)
from left to right facing the figure, first, second, and third silicon films 1202, 1202, 1203 are
first formed on the surface side of substrate 1201. The surface sides of the first, second, and
third silicon films 1202, 1202, 1203 are then covered by gate insulation film 1211. After that,
a conductive film forming the gate electrode is formed on the surface side of the gate insulation
film 1211, this is masked with resist 1213 for patterning, and gate electrode 1212 is formed. Next, as indicated by arrow 1214, an impurity that will be the donor is ion implanted, and
source-drain area 1207 is formed.Next, gate electrode 1212 is over-etched with resist 1213 as the mask, and gate electrode
1212 is narrowed as shown in Fig. 23 (b). As a result, the length of gate electrode 1212 is
shorter
