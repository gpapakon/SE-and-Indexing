<ABSTRACT>
A two-terminal miniature SMT (SMD) housing using lead-frame technology for semiconductor components, in which a semiconductor chip (1) is mounted on a lead frame part and is connected to another lead frame part, which lead frame parts are led out as soldered connections (3) from a housing (2) in which the chip (1) is encapsulated, is intended to be rationally producible without a trimming and shaping process and to be reliably sealed and further miniaturisable. The soldered connections (3) extend, as punched parts of the lead frame, laterally separated from opposite housing side walls, at least as far as the housing bottom forming the component mounting surface, the chip mounting surface and the component mounting surface forming a right angle between them.

<CLAIMS>
Two-pole SMT miniature housing using lead frame 
technology for semiconductor components, in which a 

semiconductor chip is mounted onto one lead frame part 
and makes contact with a further lead frame part, which 

lead frame parts are guided out of the housing as soldering 
terminals, in which housing the chip is encapsulated, 

characterized in that the soldering terminals (3) are 
guided as finished structural parts in the form of 

stampings of the lead frame, projecting laterally from 
opposite housing side walls, at least as far as the 

housing bottom which forms the component mounting surface, 
the chip mounting surface and the component 

mounting surface forming a right angle with one another. 
Housing according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the soldering terminals have a thickness of approximately 

0.2 mm to 0.5 mm. 
Housing according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the semiconductor component is an optoelectronic 

component. 
Housing according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the semiconductor component is a 

laterally receiving or transmitting optoelectronic 
component. 
Method for producing a housing according to one 
of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that lead frame parts 

serving as finished soldering terminals (3) are stamped 
in a lead frame, in that the semiconductor chip (1) is 

then mounted onto the one lead frame part and makes 
contact with the other lead frame part, and in that the  

 
semiconductor chip (1) is encapsulated in a housing (2) 

in such a way that the right-angled limbs of the finished 
soldering terminals (3) are guided, on two opposite outer 

sides of the housing, at least as far as the bottom or 
mounting surface of the latter, a right angle being 

formed between the chip mounting surface and the component 
mounting surface.
