<ABSTRACT>
A protective system (16) incorporated in a 
semiconductor integrated circuit device has a shared 

discharging line (16a) and a plurality of protective 
circuits (16c-16h) each having a diode (D) and a lateral 

bipolar transistor (CL) coupled between an associated pad 
(15c/12a/15i/14c/15k) and the shared discharging line 

(16a), and surge voltage applied to the pad is discharged 
through the associated protective circuit to the shared 

discharging line so that a main circuit (12/13) is not 
destroyed by the surge voltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor integrated 
circuit device and, more particularly, to a semiconductor 
integrated circuit device with a protective system against 
electrostatic destruction. A typical example of the protective system is 
disclosed in 
JP-A-3-72666, and figure 1 illustrates a 
schematic layout of a prior art semiconductor integrated 
circuit device with the protective system. A main circuit block 1 is assigned to internal 
circuits la of the integrated circuit, and circuit blocks 2 
and 3 are assigned to output buffers 2a and 3a. The main 
circuit block occupies most of the real estate of a 
semiconductor chip where the integrated circuit is 
fabricated. The internal circuits are powered through a 
power supply terminal 4a and a ground terminal 5a, and an 
input signal is supplied from an input terminal 6a to the 
internal circuits 1a. The output buffers 2a and 3a are  
 
powered through respective power supply terminals 4b and 4c 
and respective ground terminals 5a and 5b, and output data 
signals are supplied from the internal circuits 1a through 
the output buffers 2a and 3a to respective output terminals 
6b and 6c. Figure 2 illustrates the prior art protection system 
incorporated in the semiconductor integrated circuit device 
shown in figure 1. In the main circuit block 1, a power 
supply line 7a is looped for propagating the power voltage 
Vcc to the internal circuits 1a, and is connected with the 
power supply terminal 4a. An earth line 8a is also looped 
for discharging current to the ground terminal 5a, and the 
power supply line 7a and the earth line 8a are hatched in 
opposite directions for the sake of clear discrimination. 
A power supply line 7b and an earth line 8b extend from the 
power supply terminal 4b and the ground terminal 5b in the 
circuit block 2 so as to power the output buffer 2a, and 
the other output buffer 3a is powered through a power 
supply line 7c and an earth line 8c respectively connected 
with the power supply terminal 4c and the ground terminal 
5c. The power supply lines 7b and 7c are dotted for the 
sake of clear discrimination. The prior art protective system comprises a plurality  
 
of switching transistors 9a to 9v, and these switching 
transistors 9a to 9v discharge surge voltage or excess 
voltage to the earth line 8a and the power supply line 7a. 
For example, if the surge voltage over the potential at the 
ground terminal 5a is applied to the output terminal 6b, 
the switching transistor 9b turns on for discharging surge 
current
