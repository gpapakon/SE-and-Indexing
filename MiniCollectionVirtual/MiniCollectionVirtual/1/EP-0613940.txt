<ABSTRACT>
High performance overbased calcium sulfonate 
greases comprising up to about 28% by weight overbased 

calcium sulfonate, solid particles of colloidally 
dispersed calcium carbonate essentially in the form of 

calcite, a calcium soap of a fatty acid of twelve to 
twenty-four carbon atoms, and oleaginous vehicle wherein 

at a concentration of about 28% by weight overbased 
calcium sulfonate said greases have a worked cone 

penetration rating of less than about 295.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high performance
overbased calcium sulfonate greases, the preparation of
these greases and intermediates. More particularly, this
invention relates to high performance overbased calcium
sulfonate greases comprising up to 28% by weight
overbased calcium sulfonate, solid particles of
colloidally dispersed calcium carbonate essentially in the
form of calcite, a calcium soap of a fatty acid of twelve
to twenty-four carbon atoms, in an oleaginous vehicle,
said greases having a worked
cone penetration rating less than 295.As pointed out in our US-A-4,560,489
at column 1, lines 28 to 46,
thixotropic greases or grease-like overbased calcium
sulfonate compositions have corrosion-inhibiting
properties and have utility for a variety of uses such as,
for instance, in automobile and truck body undercoating,
and for various other purposes known to the art and are
disclosed in various publications and patents, such as
US-A-3,242,079; 3,372,115; 3,376,222;
3,377,283; 3,523,898; 3,661,622; 3,671,012; 3,746,643;
3,730,895; 3,816,310; and 3,492,231. Such greases or
grease-like compositions have gone into wide spread use
either as such, or mixed with other ingredients to produce
compositions for use in a variety of environments and
generally speaking they are characterized by reasonably
good Extreme Pressure & Antiwear properties, high dropping points,
reasonably good resistance to mechanical breakdown, salt
spray and water-corrosion resistance, thermal stability at
high temperatures, and other desirable properties.As is well known greases are sold in various
grades depending upon the softness of the grease. The
softer the grease the more fluid the grease. Typically 
these greases are rated or graded on the basis of their
worked cone penetration range. For example, greases sold
under the designation grade zero have a cone penetration
number from about 355 to 385, those having a cone
penetration range of 310 to 340 are designated grade one
and the most widely sold greases have a cone penetration
range of 265 to 295 and are designated grade two. The
lower the grade of the grease the more relatively
inexpensive oleaginous vehicle and the cheaper the grease.For the purposes of this invention cone
penetration is measured by the ASTM cone penetration test
(D217) as described in sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the NLGI Lubricating
Grease Guide, Second Edition. Penetration is the depth, in tenths of
millimeters, to which a standard cone sinks into the grease under
prescribed conditions. Thus higher penetration

Overbased calcium sulfonate
grease having a worked cone penetration rating of less

than 295 as measured by the ASTM cone penetration
test (D217), comprising 10% to 28% by weight overbased

calcium sulfonate, solid particles of colloidally
dispersed calcium carbonate essentially in the form of

calcite, a calcium soap of a fatty acid of twelve to
twenty-four carbon atoms, and oleaginous vehicle, which

grease is obtainable by the 
in situ
 conversion of the
solid particles of calcium carbonate to calcite a) in

the presence of the fatty acid or b) in the presence of
a converting agent for the conversion of calcium carbonate to calcite and an excess of lime, with post-addition

of the fatty acid component.
The composition of claim 1 wherein said fatty
acid of twelve to twenty-four carbon atoms is

hydroxystearic acid.
The composition of claim 1, wherein said grease
contains a calcium borate or reaction product thereof.
The composition of claim 3, wherein said
overbased calcium sulfonate comprises about 23% by

weight of the grease. 
A method of forming an overbased calcium
sulfonate rease according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

the method comprising the steps of (1) heating a
composition comprising overbased calcium sulfonate,

amorphous calcium carbonate, an oleaginous vehicle, and
a converting agent comprising a fatty acid of 12 to 24

carbon atoms and (2) treating said composition with
components comprising a fatty acid of 12 to 24 carbon

atoms.
The method of claim 5 wherein said fatty acid
is hydroxystearic acid.
The process of claim 5 wherein from 20 to 90%
by weight of the fatty acid is employed in step 1.
