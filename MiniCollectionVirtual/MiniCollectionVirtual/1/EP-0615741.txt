<ABSTRACT>
An oil-in-water type emulsion composition comprising: an 
amphiphile and a surfactant selected from the substances which can form 

a gel in an amphiphatic substance-surfactant-water system at a 
temperature of not lower than ordinary temperatures; oil and water, 

wherein substantially the total amount of amphiphile and surfactant 
exist on the boundary surfaces of emulsion particles. The emulsion 

composition has both the physical properties close to those of an 
aqueous solution and a creamy feel at the time of use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oil-in-water type emulsion
composition and, more particularly, to an improvement of the physical
properties of an oil-in-water type emulsion composition.Various emulsion compositions are generally used in the field of
cosmetics and the like.Most of these emulsion compositions are creamy or milky, and
emulsion compositions with the emulsion particle diameter reduced in
order to improve the external appearance have been developed (e.g.,
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. Sho 63-126542 (1988) and Hei 1-288330
(1989)). These emulsion compositions attract attention as a compound
having an oily component stably mixed with the system without using a
large amount of surfactant, ethanol, or the like.Although these conventional emulsion compositions are excellent
in the stability and the transparency, various studies are further
undertaken so as to provide more excellent feel, etc. at the time of
use.More specifically, it is favorable that an emulsion
composition for a cosmetic has physical properties close to those of an
aqueous solution in the container because it provides an excellent
transparent external appearance and the low viscosity improves the 
convenience at the time of packing or taking it out of the container.
On the other hand, when the emulsion composition is applied to the skin,
it preferably has a soft feel like cream.However, no emulsion composition having such antipodal
physical properties has been produced in the related art.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
eliminate the above-described problems in the related art and to provide
an oil-in-water type emulsion composition having not only the physical
properties close to those of an aqueous solution but also a creamy feel
at the time of use.As a result of studies undertaken by the present inventors so as
to achieve this aim, it has been found that an oil-in-water type
emulsion composition having substantially the total amount of amphiphile
and surfactant which can form a gel in a water phase on each boundary
surface between an oil phase as the inner phase and a water phase as the
outer phase has not only physical properties close to those of an
aqueous solution but also a creamy feel at the time of use. On the
basis of this finding, the present invention has been achieved.In general oil-in-water type emulsion compositions, it is
considered that an amphiphile and a surfactant form gels in a water
phase and solidify the base material (Barry, B.W., J. Colloid Interface
Sci., 28, 82-91 (1968),
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An oil-in-water emulsion comprising, in addition to
the oil and water, an amphiphile and a cationic or anionic

surfactant selected from substances which can form a gel
having a transition temperature not below 60°C in an

amphiphile-surfactant-water system;

wherein not less than 90%, by differential scanning
calorimetry, of the amphiphile and the surfactant exist on

the boundary surfaces of the emulsion particles;
wherein the average emulsion particle diameter is not
more than 0.15 µm;
wherein the amount of the oil is not less than ½ of
the total amount of the amphiphile and the surfactant;
wherein the total amount of the amphiphile and the
surfactant is not less than 0.2 wt % of the water phase;

and
wherein the amphiphile comprises an alcohol and/or a
fatty acid having a carbon chain length of not less than

16.
An emulsion according to claim 1, obtainable by
emulsification at a pressure of not less than 6895 kPa

(1000 psi).
An emulsion according to claim 2, obtainable by
emulsification at a pressure of not less than 20685 kPa

(3000 psi).
An emulsion according to any of claims 1 to 3,
obtainable by emulsification at a temperature not lower

than the transition temperature of said gel.
