<ABSTRACT>
A thoracentesis needle assembly comprises a longitudinally extending hollow needle (20) which is sharp at its distal end, a longitudinally extending hollow probe (50) which extends through the hollow needle and has a blunt distal end (52) with an opening (54), a spring (80) which is coupled to the probe and which resiliently biases the probe forward with respect to the hollow needle such that the blunt distal end of the probe extends past the sharp distal end of the needle, a hollow housing (30) which is fixed to the needle and which houses the spring and permits movement of the probe relative to the housing, a hollow luer adapter (112) providing a flow path for fluid, and an automatic check valve (100) in the fluid flow path, where the automatic check valve (100) permits flow of fluid in a proximal direction, but prevents flow of fluid in a distal direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to medical
instruments. More particularly, the present invention relates
to thoracentesis needle devices which are used in the removal
of fluid from the pleural cavity and which prevent air entry
into the pleural cavity during use.The thoracentesis procedure involves incising through the
chest wall, and inserting a tube or catheter through the chest
wall and into the pleural cavity. By providing a negative
pressure at the proximal end of the catheter, intrathoracic
fluid such as blood, puss, air, and other secretions are
removed from the pleural cavity. While removal of the
intrathoracic fluid is desirable, at the same time it is
imperative for a negative pressure to be maintained in the
pleural cavity in order to permit the lungs to remain expanded
such that breathing can continue. In order to maintain a
negative pressure in the pleural cavity, care must be taken to
avoid communication between the pleural cavity and atmospheric
pressure, as a passage of air from outside the body into the
pleural cavity can collapse the lung; a medical condition
known as pneumothorax.A common manner of conducting a thoracentesis procedure
is to make a chest wall incision using a needle. In
introducing the needle into the pleural cavity, care must be
taken to avoid pushing the needle too far and puncturing the
lung, as air from the lung space could escape into the pleural
cavity and result in a lung collapse. In such cases it is
actually possible to produce a pressure within the pleural
cavity which is greater than atmospheric pressure, and cardiac
compromise is a possible consequence. A thoracentesis device which purportedly reduces
possibility of lung puncture and reduces pneumothorax due to
entry of air into the pleural cavity is proposed in U.S.
Patent #4,447,235 to Clarke. The proposed device includes a
needle having a drainage opening which extends through a
catheter and a through an elongated conduit connected to the
catheter. The elongate conduit is provided with a seal and a
manual valve. The seal, which is punctured by the needle when
the needle is inserted through the elongate conduit and
catheter, prevents air leakage into the pleural cavity by
sealing around the needle and resealing when the needle is
removed. The manual valve, when moved, permits the elongate
conduit to open to a side conduit when the needle is removed,
thereby permitting long term drainage of the pleural cavity.
In the Clarke patent, the removal of the needle is what
reduces the possibility of lung
