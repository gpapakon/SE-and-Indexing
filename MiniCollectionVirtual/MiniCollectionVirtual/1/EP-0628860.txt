<ABSTRACT>
A modified gelatin is disclosed wherein part of the free 
carboxyl groups is replaced by modifiers having more acid end-standing 

groups chosen from -SO₃M, -OSO₃M, -SSO₃M, -OPO(OH)₂, - 
OPO(OH)(OR²), -PO(OH)₂, -PO(OH)(OR²). 
In a preferred embodiment such a modified gelatin is 
incorporated in a DTR photographic material which after processing 

can serve as a lithographic printing plate. Thanks to the more 
hydrophilic character of the modified gelatin the differentiation 

between printing and non-printing areas is improved and toning at 
printing start-up is r
educed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new type of modified gelatin, 
to photographic materials containing it, and to a method for making 
a lithographic printing plate according to the silver salt diffusion 
transfer process improved for differentiation between printing areas 
and non-printing areas. The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal 
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described in e.g. 
US-A-2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion 
Processes" by Andre Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London 
and New York (1972). In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an 
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into 
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into 
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing 
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to 
form a silver image having reversed image density values ("DTR-image") 
with respect to the black silver image obtained in the 
exposed areas of the photographic material. A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic 
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the water-repellent 
ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive ink-repellent 
background. For example, typical lithographic printing plates are 
disclosed in e.g. EP-A-423399 and EP-A-410500. The DTR-image can be formed in the image-receiving layer of a 
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to 
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called two-sheet 
DTR element) or in the image-receiving layer of a so-called 
single-support-element, also called mono-sheet element, which 
contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
integral with an image-receiving layer in waterpermeable 
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which is 
preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the DTR 
method.  
 As for other printing plates it is required that the printing 
plates obtained according to the DTR-process have a good ink 
acceptance in the printing areas and no ink acceptance in the non-printing 
areas (no staining). It is furthermore desirable that the 
number of copies that have to be disposed of because of ink 
acceptance in the non-printing areas (so called toning) during 
start-up of the printing process is limited. It will be readily understood by those skilled
