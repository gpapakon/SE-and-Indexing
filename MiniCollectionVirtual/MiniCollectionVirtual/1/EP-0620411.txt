<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ballistic armour composites, 
that is to say rigid composites which comprise reinforcing 
fibre or fabrics embedded in a polymer matrix. Polymer composites are gaining importance in ballistic 
protection for military and civilian personnel, due mainly to 
the high strength, stiffness, and elongation provided by man-made 
fibres. Such composites offer many advantages over metal 
armour, including high durability, light weight and low 
maintenance costs. Various composites have been proposed in the past for use 
in ballistic protection. A commonly used composite comprises 
a laminated structure consisting of woven or knitted glass 
fibre structures embedded in various types of polymer matrices 
such as, for example, epoxy resin, polyester resin and 
phenolic resin. In the main, prior known composites have 
comprised a single type of glass fibre as the reinforcement 
embedded in one or more polymer matrices. The glass fibre most commonly used for general 
reinforcement has been that known as E-glass, which is a 
family of glasses with a calcium aluminoborosilicate 
composition and a maximum alkali content of 2%. E-glasses are 
used as a general purpose reinforcement when strength and high 
electrical resistivity are required. Second types of glass 
commonly used are that known as S-glass and that known as R-glass. 
These are a family of glasses which have a magnesium 
aluminosilicate composition. S-glasses (produced by Owens-Corning 
Fiberglas Corp.) and R-glasses (produced by Vetrotex 
Inc) demonstrate higher strength than E-glasses and are 
therefore used in applications where very high tensile 
strength is required. R-glass, S-glass and so-called S2-glass 
fibres have broadly similar glass compositions but have 
different coatings applied to them. More stringent quality 
control procedures are necessary with R-glass and S-glass than  
 
with E-glasses to meet military specifications, therefore R-glass 
and S-glass are far more expensive than the E-glasses. The ballistic performance of various composites may be 
tested and compared in many different ways. One convenient 
way, for example, is to fire a known sized projectile at 
samples of the composite and to record the velocity at which 
theoretically, 50% of the projectiles penetrate the composite 
and the other 50% are stopped by the composite. This velocity 
is often referred to as the V₅₀ velocity. If one carries out ballistic performance tests on a 
composite comprising solely E-glass fibres embedded in, for 
example, a
