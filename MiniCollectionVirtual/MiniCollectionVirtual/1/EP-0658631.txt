<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process and an installation for adding an alloying component to a stream of molten metal, in particular lead to a steel melt, in a distributor (4) for a continuous casting process for producing billets. The object of the invention is to provide a possible way of introducing lead or another heavy metal into steel or another metal so as to give a uniform distribution of the lead and avoid the danger of forming a sediment layer of lead. This is achieved by generating a steel stream, to which the alloying component is added, in the distributor (4), which stream is subjected at least once to flow acceleration and flow deceleration.
