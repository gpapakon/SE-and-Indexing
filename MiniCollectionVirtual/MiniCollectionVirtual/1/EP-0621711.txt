<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a switching system with a
plurality of switching means (FM,SM) which are connected to a communication

network (CM).
Each of said plurality of switching means operates independently
of each other and has call processing means for executing

a call processing in accordance with information from
an associated subscriber line or trunk line.
Said communication network includes transmission means for
transmitting information to be received/transmitted through

an associated subscriber line or trunk line in the form of
fixed length packets each having a header added thereto,

said header containing information about a destination of
said information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a switching system
according to the preamble of claim 1.In the field of switching systems,studies
have been concentrated on the realization of high-speednd
wide band performance, increase in the capacity of a
channel and advanced improvements in reliability.
Conceivably, a specified expedient to this end resides
in the distribution of a channel system, especially,
a multiplexer stage. This expedient takes the advantage
of the distribution of load which contributes to an
improvement in throughput and to an increase in the
capacity of the overall exchange and the distribution
of the physical configuration which contribute to the
distribution of danger.In the past, the exchange played a major role
in switching low-speed telephone voice but it is expected
that a high-speed data communication as applicable to 
image data will be in great demand in future. Under
these circumstances, the exchange is required to be
drastically improved in the call throughput but the throughput
of a processor can not be extended unlimitedly. To
promote the throughput of the processor, the distribution
of functions and the distribution of load based
on a multi-processor scheme may conceivably be adopted.
This countermeasure, however, increases the complexity of
software and besides suffers from a bottleneck caused
by communications between processors and the like factor,
thus failing to eliminate the limitation imposed on the
throughput.Incidentally, from the standpoint of the
enlargement of the system and the distribution of danger,
it is desirable to realize individual function units of
the exchange with individual modules and that these
modules are physically distributed. In such an instance,
unless an independent distribution configuration is
adopted wherein processors per se are distributed, the
load is concentrated on a central processor and
inconveniently the number of lines for controlling
each distributed module is increased.In a distributed type switching system in
which the speech path system is distributed and the
control system is concentrated at a location, the throughput
of the control system is limited and the merits of the
distribution of load can not fully mature to advantage.
Under these circumstances, a switching system 
is desired to be of an independent distributed configuration
in which not only the speech path system but
also the control system is distributed. The use of
independent modules is however problematic in that when
a module communicates with another module, the sending

A switching system comprising:

a plurality of first modules (201 - 208) which each
operate to determine a destination first module of

received information, perform a switching operation
thereon and add a header indicating a destination first

module to said information so as to output said
information with said header appended thereto in the

form of fixed length packets multiplexed on a
predetermined frame to a second module (100) delivering

packets received from the plurality of first modules
(201 - 208) to a destination first module based on

said header,
characterized in that

said second module (100) having a space switch (103)
interconnecting said plurality of first modules

(201 - 208) and a collision preventing circuit (102)
controlling the transmission/reception timings of

packets passing through said space switch (103) to
rearrange said packets so that packets having identical

destination first modules within one frame may not
collide against each other while being switched

simultaneously by the space switch (103).
A switching system according to claim 1, wherein said
second module (100) has a buffer memory for storing

packets functionally connected between the space switch
(103) and the plurality of first modules (201 - 208),

said buffer memory is controlled by the collision
preventing circuit (102). 
A switching system according to claim 2, wherein the
collision preventing circuit (102) looks up headers of

packets stored in said buffer memory to identify
packets having identical destination first modules

within one frame.
A switching system according to claim 2 or 3, wherein
the collision preventing circuit (102) has an address

calculator (604) to generate addresses for writing
packets into said buffer memory or reading packets from

said buffer memory to perform a rearrangement of
packets in order to prevent collision of packets being

switched simultaneously by the space switch (103).
A switching system according to any one of claims 2 to
4, wherein the collision preventing circuit (102) has a

memory means to store the idle/busy status of packets
for source first modules and destination first modules

within one frame based on the packet headers.
A switching system according to any one of claims 1 to
5, wherein said second module (100) has time switches

(111 - lln) functionally connected between the space
switch (103) and the plurality of first modules

(201 - 208), said time switches (111 - lln) being
controlled by the collision preventing circuit (102) to

rearrange packets in order to prevent collision of
packets being switched simultaneously by the space

switch (103).
A switching system according to any one of claims 1 to
6, wherein the collision preventing circuit (102) works

with wired logics.
A switching system according to any one of claims 1 to
7, wherein the operation speed of the space switch
