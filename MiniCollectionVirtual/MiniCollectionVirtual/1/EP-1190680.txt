<ABSTRACT>
A medical stand apparatus supports light-weight medical
equipment and is installable directly on a patient bed or in

a small space adjacent to a patient bed.
The medical stand apparatus has a base (10) spaced away
from the floor (F), a horizontal rotation member (11), and a

protrusion (11a). With the use of these elements, the medical
stand apparatus directly attaches a parallel link mechanism (6)

including a longitudinal sub-link (14) and a lateral sub-link
(15) to support the medical equipment to a table (8) on which

a patient (7) is laid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a medical stand apparatus.A medical field such as neurosurgery employs a surgical microscope to enlarge and observe a target part and carry out an operation on the target part. The surgical microscope must be easy to use, to shorten an operation time and relieve a patient and an operator of physical and mental fatigue.The surgical microscope or any other medical equipment is frequently combined with assistant apparatuses for easing the use of the medical equipment. Among the assistant apparatuses, a stand apparatus is used to support the medical equipment. An example of a stand apparatus is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 6-197912 corresponding to EP-A 0 628 290. The stand apparatus usually has a parallel link mechanism and a counterweight, to lightly move and stop a heavy surgical microscope at an optional spatial position. With the stand apparatus, an operator may quickly and easily move the surgical microscope like the operator's own limbs to a desired position without assist of actuator, keep the microscope at the position, and orient the microscope toward a target part.Conventional stand apparatuses are designed to support large and heavy surgical microscopes and attachments, and therefore, are themselves large and heavy. Accordingly, they are improper to support light medical equipment such as photon radiation systems, endoscopes, or measuring devices. Namely, the conventional stand apparatuses are too bulky to support light medical equipment and are inconvenient to transport and handle.When a surgical microscope supported by a conventional stand apparatus is moved, a counterweight of the stand apparatus widely shifts its position. The stand apparatus, therefore, needs a large installation space and is unable to install in a narrow space beside a bed, or directly to the bed.An object of the present invention is to provide a medical stand apparatus that is appropriate to support light medical equipment and is directly installable on a bed or in a narrow space beside a bed.This object is solved by a medical stand apparatus as defined in claim 1.In order to accomplish the object, a first aspect of the present invention provides a medical stand apparatus 1 having a base 10 fixed to a patient table 8 at a position away from the floor F, a horizontally rotatable member 11 attached to the base and horizontally rotatable around a vertical axis α1 orthogonal to the base, a parallel link mechanism 6 supported by a fulcrum S arranged on the

<CLAIMS>
A medical stand apparatus (18) comprising:

a base (19) set on the floor (F), the base (19) having a post (21) installed on the base (19), the post (21) being horizontally articulated about an axis of rotation (α1) oriented in a predetermined direction with respect to the base (19), the post (21) being provided with upper and lower articulations (S1, S2);
a parallel link mechanism (6) supported by the upper articulation (S1), the parallel link (6) having a pair of parallel longitudinal links (2, 3) and a pair of lateral links (4, 5);
a support arm (4a) extending from the upper lateral link (4) of the parallel link mechanism, a front end of the support arm (4a) supporting an end link (12);
a crank (13) articulated about a first articulation (β1) of the parallel link mechanism, the first articulation (β1) serving as a start point of the support arm (4a);
a longitudinal sub-link (14) parallel with the longitudinal links (2, 3), a lower end of the longitudinal sub-link (14) being articulated at a front end (β8) of a horizontal first upper protrusion (30) formed on the post (21), one of the longitudinal links (2) adjacent to the support arm (4a), the crank (13), the longitudinal sub-link (14), and the first upper protrusion (30) forming a first auxiliary parallel link;
a lateral sub-link (15) parallel with the support arm (4a), the lateral sub-link (15) cooperatively moving in response to position of the longitudinal sub-link (14) through the crank (13), an upper end of the end link (12) being articulated at a first end (β9) of the lateral sub-link (15) opposite the crank (13), the support arm (4a), the upper end of the end link, the lateral sub-link (15), and the crank (13) forming a second auxiliary parallel link;
an interlocked longitudinal link (22) always parallel with the longitudinal links (2, 3), an upper end of the interlocked longitudinal link (22) being articulated at the
 lower articulation (S2), a lower end of the interlocked longitudinal link (22) being articulated at a first end (β14) of an interlocked lateral link (23);
a second upper protrusion (2a) formed at a lower end of the longitudinal links (2, 3), a front end of the second upper protrusion (2a) being connected to a front end of a lower protrusion (22a) formed at an upper end of the interlocked longitudinal link (22) through an interlocked longitudinal sub-link, the orientation and length of a straight line between upper and lower articulations of the interlocked longitudinal sub-link (24) being equal to those of a straight line (L1) between the upper and lower articulations (S1, S2);
a weight link (25) connecting an end (β3) of the lower lateral link (5) of the parallel link mechanism (6) opposite the medical equipment and a second end (β15) of the interlocked lateral link (23), the weight link (25) being parallel with a straight line (L2) between the upper articulation (S1) and the first end (β14) of the interlocked lateral link (23); and
a counterweight (W) arranged at the second end (β15) of the interlocked lateral link (23),
the counterweight (W) cooperatively moving toward and away from the lower articulation (S2) in response to movement of the medical equipment (M) about the upper articulation (S1), the weight of the counterweight (W) acting on the parallel link mechanism (6) to keep the medical equipment at an optional spatial position.
