<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-chip 
module in which a plurality of circuit elements such as 
LSI chips are mounted on a high-density wiring board 
(also referred to as a circuit board). Recently, multi-chip modules have become 
attractive in which a plurality of LSI chips are 
mounted on a high-density wiring board in order to 
speed up the operation and reduce the production cost. 
As is well known, multi-chip modules are classified 
into three types, namely a MCM-L, MCM-C and MCM-D. The 
multi-chip modules of the MCM-L type have a printed 
wiring board on which circuit elements are mounted, and 
enable reduction in the production cost. The multi-chip 
modules of the MCM-C type have a thin-film multi-layer 
ceramic board on which circuit elements are 
mounted, and enable reduction in the production cost 
and speeding up the operation to some extent. The 
multi-chip modules of the MCM-D type have a thick-film 
board made of ceramic or the like, on which a circuit 
board having at least one multi-layer structure in 
which an insulating layer and at least one wiring 
conductor layer are alternately stacked. Circuit 
elements are mounted on the above circuit board. As 
compared to the other two types, the MCM-D type multi-chip 
modules operate at high speeds and enable mounting 
of circuit elements with a high density. Fig. 1 is a side view of a conventional MCM-D 
type multi-chip module, which includes a thick-film 
ceramic board 10 having a multi-layer structure. LSI 
chips 14 and passive elements 16 such as resistors and 
capacitors are mounted on a first surface of the thick-film 
ceramic board 10. These circuit elements 14 and  
 
16 are connected to wiring lines formed inside the 
thick-film ceramic board 10. A large number of I/O 
pins 12 are attached to a second surface of the ceramic 
board 10 opposite to the first surface thereof. The 
multi-chip module is directly mounted on a printed 
wiring board 18 by inserting the I/O pins 12 into holes 
formed in the printed wiring board 18. Fig. 2 is a side view of a conventional MCM-D 
type multi-chip module. In Fig. 2, parts that are the 
same as those shown in Fig. 1 are given the same 
reference numbers as previously. In order to speed up 
the operation and increase the density, a thin-film 
circuit board 20 is provided on the first surface of 
the thick-film ceramic board 10. The circuit elements 
14 and 16 are mounted on the thin-film circuit board 
20, and are connected to the thick-film ceramic board 
10 and the I/O pins 12 via wiring
