<ABSTRACT>
Hydraulic control device comprising a valve (4) movable within a housing (1) and means for opening said valve at a position in its travel which is adjustable. The means comprise a stop (6) sliding in an axial chamber (7) under the effect of a spring (8) and a clamp screw (9). The valve (4) opening position can be easily adjusted from the exterior of the housing (1).

<CLAIMS>
Hydraulic control device comprising, on the one 
hand, a valve (4) which can be moved along an axial 

direction inside a sealed casing (1) filled with a fluid 
whose flow is at least controlled by this valve and, on 

the other hand, opening means which enable this movable 
valve to be opened in a selective fashion when it is 

moved, under the effect of a first axial force of higher 
intensity than a first threshold, into an open position, 

and this open position to be chosen from a range of 
possible positions extending along the axial direction, 

the opening means comprising: 

a stop (6) slideably mounted in an axial housing 
(7) facing the valve, this stop having one end 

(6a) in contact with which this valve can open 
when it is forced there by the first axial 

force; and 
means (9, 12, 13) for blocking the stop, capable 
of preventing the stop from sliding in its 

housing,
 
characterized in that the opening means comprise 

a spring (8), trapped between the bottom (7a) of 
the housing and the axial stop (6) exerting on 

the stop a second axial force opposed to the 
first and of lower intensity than the first 

threshold, this spring being sufficiently 
deformable to apply the second axial force to 

the stop regardless of the point of the said 
range at which the end (6a) of this stop is 

located, and in that the blocking means comprise 
a screw (9) capable of moving in a bore which is 

at least partially tapped (10) emerging into the  
 

said housing (7), and capable of preventing, 
only selectively, the stop from sliding in its 

housing under the effect of axial forces of 
lower intensity than a second threshold, itself 

higher than the first threshold. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the blocking means comprise a bearing bush (12) 

bearing against the stop and a spring (13) compressed by 
the screw and itself pressing on the bearing bush.
