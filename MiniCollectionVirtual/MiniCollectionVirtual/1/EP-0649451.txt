<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for obtaining a double-layer coating. A pigmented base paint is first applied, the thus obtained base paint layer is covered with a translucent powder lacquer and finally the base paint layer and the translucent lacquer layer are baked together. As translucent powder lacquer is used a powder lacquer which contains an epoxide group-containing polyacrylate resin as binder and a mixture of (A) a polyanhydride and (B) a carboxyl group-containing polyester resin as cross-linking agent. The polyester resin is produced by reacting a diol (b1), a compound (b2) that contains per molecule at least three functional groups selected among hydroxyl, primary amino, secondary amino, carboxyl and acid anhydride groups and (b3) a dicarboxylic acid, in a molar ratio between (b1) : (b2) : (b3) equal to 0.0-3.0:1.0:1.5-9.0, until a polyester resin having an acid number from 40 to 300 is obtained.

Process for the production of two-coat 
finishes on a substrate surface, in which 


(1) a pigmented basecoat is applied to the substrate 
surface, 
(2) a polymer film is formed from the coat applied in 
step (1), 
(3) a powder clearcoat which contains an epoxide 
group-containing polyacrylate resin as binder is 

applied to the resulting basecoat film, and 
subsequently 
(4) the basecoat is baked together with the powder 
clearcoat, 
 
characterized in that the powder clearcoat employed in 

step (3) as crosslinking agent contains a mixture of 

(A) 5 to 95 per cent by weight of a compound which 
contains on statistical average at least two carboxyl 

groups and at least one acid anhydride group per 
molecule, or a mixture of such compounds, and 
(B) 95 to 5 per cent by weight of a carboxyl group-containing 
polyester resin obtainable by reacting 


(b1) a diol or a mixture of diols, 
(b2) a compound which contains per molecule at least 

three functional groups selected from hydroxyl, primary 
amino, secondary amino, carboxyl and acid anhydride 

groups, one acid anhydride group being regarded as 
equivalent to two carboxyl groups, or a mixture of such 

compounds and 
(b3) a dicarboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid anhydride 
or a mixture of dicarboxylic acids and/or dicarboxylic 

acid anhydrides 
 
in a molar ratio of (b1) : (b2) : (b3) = 0.0 to 

3.0 : 1.0 : 1.5 to 9.0 to give a polyester resin having 
an acid value of 40 to 300, 
 
the percentages by weight relating to (A) + (B) = 

100 per cent by weight and the mixture of (A) and (B) 
being present in an amount such that 0.5 to 1.5 

equivalents of carboxyl groups are present per  
 

equivalent of epoxide groups of the epoxide group-containing 
polyacrylate resin, each anhydride group 

being regarded as equivalent to one carboxyl group. 
Powder coatings which contain an epoxide 
group containing polyacrylate resin as binder, 

characterized in that they contain as crosslinking 
agent a mixture of 


(A) 5 to 95 per cent by weight of a compound which 
contains on statistical average at least two carboxyl 

groups and at least one acid anhydride group per 
molecule, or a mixture of such compounds, and 
(B) 95 to 5 per cent by weight of a carboxyl group-containing 
polyester resin obtainable by reacting 


(b1) a diol or a mixture of diols, 
(b2) a compound which contains per molecule at least 
three functional groups selected from hydroxyl, primary 

amino, secondary amino, carboxyl and acid anhydride 
groups, one acid anhydride group being regarded as 

equivalent to two carboxyl groups, or a mixture of such 
compounds and 
(b3) a dicarboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid anhydride 
or a mixture of dicarboxylic acids and/or dicarboxylic 

acid anhydrides

3.0 : 1.0 : 1.5 to 9.0 to give a polyester resin having

equivalents of carboxyl groups are present per 
equivalent of epoxide groups of the epoxide group-containing

Process according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the basecoat applied in step (1) contains a 

metallic pigment, preferably an aluminium flake 
pigment. 
Process or powder coatings according to Claim 
1 or 2, characterized in that component (A) is a polyanhydride

polycarboxylic acid, preferably of an aliphatic or

step (1), 
(3) applying a powder clearcoat according to Claim 2
