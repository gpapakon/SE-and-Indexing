<DESCRIPTION>
Aqueous compositions which comprise a non-ionic
surfactant and an alkali metal hydroxide are useful in
various applications, such as chemical peeling or
washing of fruit or vegetables, metal degreasing or
cotton mercerization. Such compositions are also useful
as cleaning compositions, for example to wash containers
for food, for mechanical dishwashing and particularly
for industrial washing of containers which are recycled
and utilized several times, such as bottles. The non-ionic
surfactant comprised in such aqueous alkaline
compositions improves the wetting and cleaning ability
of the compositions. The surfactant should exhibit a
good wetting behavior and low foaming. In order to
reduce the costs for transportation, the aqueous
alkaline compositions are usually produced and
transported as concentrates containing a very high
concentration, often up to saturation, of alkali metal
hydroxide. These concentrates are diluted with water
prior to their use. Therefore, the non-ionic surfactant
should have a sufficiently high solubility in the
aqueous alkaline composition, even if it contains a
large amount of alkali metal hydroxide. The non-ionic
surfactant should also be biodegradable.Published French Patent Application 2,540,511
discloses strongly alkaline compositions which contain
from 80 to 95 percent of a 50 percent aqueous solution
of sodium hydroxide, 1 to 5 percent of complexing
agents, 0.5 to 2.5 percent of copolymers of ethylene
oxide and propylene oxide and 0.5 to 2.5 percent of a
sucroglyceride, all percentages being by weight. The 
use of the strongly alkaline composition for industrial
bottle washing is disclosed.Propylene oxide/ethylene oxide block copolymers
of a molecular weight of 2,000 to 3,000 have been widely
used as non-ionic surfactants in aqueous strongly
alkaline compositions. Unfortunately, these propylene
oxide/ethylene oxide block copolymers are poorly
biodegradable.Published German Patent Application 1,924,332
discloses a strongly alkaline, storage stable, viscous
liquid or pasty cleaner for ovens and grills. The
cleaner comprises 4 to 20 percent of caustic alkali,
1 to 15 percent of a thickener, 2 to 18 percent of a
glycol and 0.2 to 3 percent of a non-ionic surfactant,
all percentages being by weight. The non-ionic
surfactant is an addition product of an alkylene oxide
with a higher fatty alcohol containing 8 to 20,
preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms and/or with an alkyl
phenol containing 8 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl
radical. The addition product is produced by reacting 2
