<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a headset according to the introductory
part of claim 1.In the past, attempts to combine the two protections i.e.,
high and low frequency attenuation, has resulted in not only
the noise being attenuated but also the speech that the
wearer needs to hear. Some systems met only limited success
with fixed or "near-stationary" noise but not with the other
noise of either (a) varying spectral characteristics or (b)
brief duration noises with "spikes". Examples of such a system
is found in US-patent no. 4 025 721 and US-patent 4 185
168. Other systems like that found in US-patent no. 4 455 675
actively attenuate all sounds at low frequencies and passively
attenuate all high frequency sounds. These sounds include
speech and warning signals that want to be heard by the
person wearing the headset.In applications for noise canceling headsets, particularly in
industrial environments, attenuation of low frequency noise
as well as noise that covers the speech band (300 to 3300 Hz) 
passive hearing protection works extremely well at higher
frequencies (typically above 1000 Hz) whereas active noise
cancellation has been shown to achieve similar levels of protection
at low frequencies (50 to 1000 Hz). Passive, however,
also attenuates speech and warning signals and the protectors
are uncomfortable to wear.The object of the present invention is to provide a headset system
for actively cancelling unwanted noise while selectively
allowing necessary speech to reach the user's ear, a handset
means adapted to be worn by user, means for attenuating
noise, and speech filtering means for actively cancelling unwanted
noise while selectively allowing speech to reach the
user's ear.The instant invention solves the problem up to now existant,
that of total attentuation of the noise and speech, by providing
a solution of an active headset that can employ any of
several selective algorithms such as those disclosed in US-patent
4 654 871. Alternatively, it can employ the algorithm
disclosed in US-patent 5 105 377. In addition it can
employ other algorithms such as that disclosed in US-patent 5
126 681.Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present
invention will become apparent from the following detailed
description of the invention when considered in conjunction
with the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 shows a typical active/passive headset system incorporating the instant
invention.Fig. 2 shows an active plus selective headset system with an open back muff
that incorporates active control and
