<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a hydraulic motor of which the characteristics have been improved in the way that auxiliary passages (13) intended to supply oil in under the action members (6) in order to seal these against the guiding surface have been placed in peripheral direction on either side of the sealing region (15) and are disposed to extend in a motor with two chambers 12 to 25 degrees, and in a motor with three chambers 5 to 12 degrees, towards the working region (19). In order to ensure the oil supply and exit, and to preclude occurence of pressure shocks, the margin of the stator (1) adjacent to the valve plate (5) comprises, in register with the supply/exit apertures (12), grooves (17) which extend, as viewed peripherally, over the entire transition region (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a hydraulic 
motor comprising a stator, a rotor concentrically disposed 
therein, said rotor comprising elongated slots 
which are provided with radially movable and freely 
rolling cylindrical action members, a valve plate, and 
possibly also an end plate on the opposite end, between 
said rotor and said stator being peripherally defined 
two or more chambers constituting working regions and 
between which are defined sealing regions. The valve 
plate comprises at both ends of the chamber, in peripheral 
direction, oil supply and exit apertures, 
which define a transition region between the sealing 
and working regions. The stator surfaces in the sealing 
region and in the working region which control/guide 
the action members are both shaped to be concentric, 
and the surfaces of the transition regions interposed 
between them are shaped to join them smoothly at their 
ends, whereby the action members are radially immovable 
in the working region and move in radial direction in 
said transition regions only. The valve plate comprises 
auxiliary supply passages separate from the main supply 
passages and disposed in register with the bottom of 
the rotor slots, for providing pressurized oil under 
the action members in order to seal these against the 
guiding surface. The problem in motors of this type is caused 
by the pressure shocks due to unfavourable arrangement 
of the exit-side passages, said shocks resulting in 
jerky running, in particular at low speeds of rotation. 
The pressure shocks are due to sudden reduction of oil 
pressure on the exit side. The pressure shocks cause 
objectionable lowering of the mechanical efficiency. The object of the invention is to disclose a 
hydraulic motor which is an improvement of hydraulic 
motors of the type described in US-A-2 725 013, presenting improved efficiency,  
 
a structural design which is orthodox from 
the viewpoint of flow technology, and smooth, jerk-free 
running at low speeds as well. The hydraulic motor of the invention is characterized 
by that which is stated in the claim following 
below. As taught by the invention, the supply passages 
are placed in peripheral direction on either side of 
the sealing region, and disposed to extend towards the 
working region through 12 to 25 degrees in a motor with 
two chambers, or through 5 to 12 degrees in a motor 
with three chambers, and to the purpose of ensuring 
the supply and exit of oil, and preventing the occurrence 
of pressure shocks, the margin of the stator

<CLAIMS>
A hydraulic motor comprising a stator (1), a 

rotor (2) concentrically disposed therein and comprising 
a plurality of longitudinal slots provided with 

radially movable rolling cylindrical action members 
(6); a valve plate (5) and possibly also an end plate 

(4), between the rotor and stator being left in radial 
direction two or more chambers constituting working 

regions (19), between which lie sealing regions (15); 
and wherein the valve plate (5) comprises, at both ends 

of the chamber as viewed in peripheral direction, oil 
supply/exit apertures (12), which define a transition 

region (18) between the sealing region (15) and the 
working region (19); and wherein those surfaces of the 

stator's (1) sealing region (15) and working region 
(19) which control and/or guide the action members have both 

been shaped to be concentric and the surfaces in the 
transition regions (18) therebetween are shaped to join 

these smoothly at the ends, whereby the action members 
(6), while in the working region, are radially immovable 

and they move in radial direction in the transition 
regions only; and wherein the valve plate (5) comprises 

auxiliary supply passages (13) separate from the 
principal supply passages and placed in register with 

the bottom of the slots in the rotor, for providing 
pressurized oil under the action members in order to 

seal them against the controlling and/or guiding surface, 

characterized in that
 the auxiliary supply passages 
(13) are placed peripherally on either side of the 

sealing region (15) and disposed to extend from 12 
to 25 degrees in a motor with two chambers, and from 

5 to 12 degrees in a motor with three chambers, -as viewed in peripheral direction-, towards 
the working region (19); and that for ensuring the oil 

supply and exit and for precluding the generation of 
pressure shocks the margin of the stator (1) adjacent 

to the valve plate (5) comprises in register with the  
 

supply/exit apertures (12), grooves (17) extending, as 
viewed in peripheral direction, over the entire transition 

region (18).
