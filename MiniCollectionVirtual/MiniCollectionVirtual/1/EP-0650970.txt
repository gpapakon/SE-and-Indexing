<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel bisketene 
derivatives and to a process for production thereof. The 
present invention also relates to the use of the bisketene 
derivatives. Ketenes are known and were first reported by Staudinger 
in Chem. Ber.1905, 38, 1735-1739, the contents of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. The simplest ketene has 
the formula 
CH₂=C=Oand is also known as ethenone and carbomethene. The discovery of bisketenes followed shortly thereafter 
and was reported by Diels et al. in Chem. Ber.1906, 39, 
689-697, the contents of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. Specifically, Diels et al. disclosed preparation 
of carbon suboxide via dehydration of malonic acid according 
to the following reaction 
CH₂(CO₂H)₂ + P₂O₅ -→ O=C=C=C=O.Staudinger et al. in Chem. Ber.1908, 41, 4461-4465 reported 
an alternate synthesis for carbon suboxide via a zinc 
catalyzed double debromination according to the following 
reaction 
CBr₂(COBr)₂ + Zn -→ O=C=C=C=OThe chemistry of carbon suboxide has been reviewed by 
Kappe et al. in Agnew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.1974, 13, 491-504, 
the contents of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. Staudinger was, however, unsuccessful in his pursuit of 
a preparation for quinoketene (see Staudinger et al. in 
Chem. Ber.1911, 44, 1623-1633, the contents of which are 
incorporated herein by reference) and 1,2-bisketene (1,3-butadiene-1,4-dione, 
see Staudinger et al. in Helv. Chim.Acta1923, 6, 321-326, the contents of which are 
incorporated herein by reference). Those bisketenes which have been synthesized, are quite 
reactive and, in some cases, unstable - see Hatchard et al. 
in J. Am. Chem. Soc.1957, 79, 6261-6263, Blomquist et al. 
in J. Am. Chem. Soc.1957, 79, 2021-2022, Staab et al. in 
Chem. Ber.1968, 101, 1457-1472, Boate et al. in J. Am. 
Chem. Soc.1990, 112, 8858-8863, Mosandl et al. in J. Org. 
Chem.1993, 58, 747-749, the contents of each of which are 
incorporated herein by reference. The production of substituted 1,3-butadiene-1,4-diones 
via photolysis of cyclobutenediones is known. See Obata et 
al. in Chemical Communications1971 587-588 and Miller, et 
al, in J. Org. Chem1993 90-94, the contents of each of 
which are incorporated herein by reference. The parent 1,3-butadiene-1,4 
dione has been generated by other routes 
(Kasai et al. in Chemistry Lett. 1978, 217-218 and Maier, et 
al in Chem. Ber.1982 2192-2201, the contents of each of 
which are incorporated herein by reference). However, the 
product is a short-lived and
