<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an adhesive tape (1) consisting of a flexible support (4) in strip form and of a coating (6) which has self-adhesive properties, a heat-curable material component being added to the support (4) and/or to the coating (6) such that the adhesive tape (1) possesses, after curing, properties of dimensional stability. This adhesive tape (1) is therefore particularly suitable for wrapping initially flexible wire harnesses, such as cable looms and the like, which can then be rendered dimensionally stable by heating.

<CLAIMS>
Adhesive tape (1) comprising a flexible tape-form carrier
(4) and a coating (6) which has self-adhesive properties, with

the carrier (4) and/or the coating (6) containing a material
component which is heat-curable in thermoset manner,

specifically a phenolic resin combined with an ethylene-vinyl
acetate copolymer (EVA) or with polyvinyl butyral (PVB), such

that the adhesive tape (1) has dimensionally stable thermoset
properties after curing has been brought about by a

preliminary heating at least to a curing temperature specific
to the material.
Adhesive tape according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the coating (6) is embodied as a single layer and comprises a

mixture of adhesives which contains the curable material
component.
Adhesive tape according to Claim 1, characterised in that
the coating (6) is formed as two layers from an adhesive layer

(8) and an additional layer (10) which contains the curable
material component.
Adhesive tape according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the coating (6) which contains the

curable material component is melted onto the carrier (4) in
particular at a layer thickness of from 40 to 90 g/m
2
, for
which purpose the material of the coating (6) has

thermoplastic properties prior to being heated to the curing
temperature for the first time. 
Adhesive tape according to one or more of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the phenolic resin of the curable

material component is a novolak, preferably combined with a
curing agent.
Adhesive tape according to one or more of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the coating (6) or the adhesive layer

(8) contains an epoxy resin as the component responsible for
the adhesive properties.
Adhesive tape according to one or more of Claims 1, 2 and
4 to 6, characterised in that the material of the single-layer

self-adhesive coating (6) contains from 25 to 40 parts by
weight phenolic resin and combined therewith, on the one hand,

from 60 to 75 parts by weight epoxy resin and, on the other
hand, approximately 50 parts by weight ethylene-vinyl acetate

copolymer (EVA) or polyvinyl butyral (PVB).
Adhesive tape according to Claim 7, characterised in that
the material of the coating (6) contains additionally from 5

to 60 parts by weight fillers, for example Casil and/or
kaolin.
Adhesive tape according to one or more of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the coating (6) which contains the

curable material component comprises a material which is
plastified initially by a solvent in order to apply it to the

carrier (4) and is subsequently solidified by evaporating the
solvent.
Adhesive tape according to one or more of Claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the carrier (4) is a viscose staple 

fibre and/or polyester woven or nonwoven or a film in
particular of plastics material.
Adhesive tape according to one or more of Claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the carrier (4) has on the upper surface

(12) thereof which is remote from the coating (6) a coating
(14) which is preferably resistant to oil and petrol.
Use of an adhesive tape (1) according to one or more of
Claims 1 to 11 for wrapping a wiring set (18) which comprises

at least one flexible wire (16), is provided in particular for
installation in a motor vehicle and contains preferably at

least one electrical wire, at least one sheathed wire and/or
at least one fibre-optic light guide, and is in particular

embodied as a cable harness.
Process for making a wiring set (18) which is
dimensionally stable within the meaning of thermoset

properties and comprises at least one flexible wire (16),
preferably a plurality of individual flexible wires (16), in

particular a dimensionally stable cable set for motor
vehicles, characterised in that the wiring set (18) is wrapped

with an adhesive tape (1) according to one or more of Claims 1
to 11 and, after alignment or positioning in a desired flow

shape, is subsequently heated briefly at least in some regions
at least to the curing temperature of the curable material

component of the adhesive tape (1), and is thus rendered
dimensionally stable.
