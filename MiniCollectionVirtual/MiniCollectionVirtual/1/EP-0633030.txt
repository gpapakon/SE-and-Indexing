<ABSTRACT>
Encapsulated gas microspheres having improved 
pressure resistance and stability are made by: mixing an 

aqueous solution of a filmogenic protein such as human 
serum albumin with a water insoluble gas such as 

perfluoropropane and subjecting the mixture to ultrasonic 
or mechanical cavitation in the absence of oxygen in an 

apparatus that is closed to the atmosphere.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
the preparation of
ultrasonic imaging
agents composed of proteinaceous microspheres
encapsulating insoluble gases and methods for their
production and use.Diagnostic ultrasonic imaging is based on the
principle that waves of sound energy can be focused upon
an area of interest and reflected in such a way as to
produce an image thereof. An ultrasonic scanner is
placed on a body surface overlying the area to be imaged,
and ultrasonic energy in the form of sound waves are
directed toward that area. The scanner detects reflected
sound waves and translates the data into video images.
When ultrasonic energy is transmitted through a
substance, the amount of energy reflected depends upon
the velocity of the transmission and the acoustic
properties of the substance. Changes in the substance's
acoustic properties (e.g., variations in acoustic
impedance) are most prominent at the interfaces of
different acoustic densities, such as liquid-solid or
liquid-gas. Consequently, when ultrasonic energy is
directed through tissue, organ structures generate sound
reflection signals for detection by the ultrasonic 
scanner. These signals can be intensified by the proper
use of a contrast agent.Ultrasound imaging agents of particular
importance employ the use of gas because of its
efficiency as a reflector of ultrasound. Resonant gas
bubbles scatter sound a thousand times more efficiently
than a solid particle of the same size. Ophir and Parker
describe two types of gas-containing imaging agents as
being: (1) free air bubbles and (2) encapsulated air
bubbles (Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology
15(4):319-333, 1989). However, free gas bubbles of the
appropriate size are too short-lived to be effective for
most in vivo applications (Meltzer, et al.,
Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology6:263-269, 1980). Ophir and Parker
point out that the development of encapsulated gas
bubbles was an attempt to overcome this problem.The second major class of gas-containing
ultrasound contrast agents described by Ophir and Parker
are the encapsulated microbubbles, hereinafter referred
to as "microspheres". The gas bubble is surrounded by a
shell composed of a protein or other biocompatible
material. A current commercial microsphere contrast
agent is ALBUNEX® (Molecular Biosystems, Inc., San Diego,
CA) which is composed of human serum albumin encapsulated
air microspheres. See U.S. Patent Nos. 4,572,203 and
4,844,882.Air microspheres have been shown to quickly
lose echogenicity when subjected to pressures of 150 mm
Hg, such
