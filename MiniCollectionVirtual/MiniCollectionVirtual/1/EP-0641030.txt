<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved, reliable photoelectric conversion device and an improved, reliable photoelectric conversion module which excel in weatherability, heat resistance and abrasion resistance and continuously exhibit a desirable photoelectric conversion efficiency without being deteriorated even upon repeated use over a long period of time under severe environmental conditions of high temperature and high humidity. More particularly, the present invention relates to an improved photoelectric conversion device and an improved photoelectric conversion module each having a photovoltaic element comprising a semiconductor active layer and a transparent and conductive layer disposed in this order on an electroconductive substrate, and a surface protective member disposed on said photovoltaic element, said surface protective member including a transparent material member composed of a specific fluorine-containing polymer resin,
wherein the photovoltaic element of the photoelectric conversion device or photoelectric conversion module is tightly sealed by means of the aforesaid specific surface protective member with an improved adhesion between the photovoltaic element and the surface protective member. Hence, the photoelectric conversion device or photoelectric conversion module excel in weatherability, moisture resistance, heat resistance and abrasion resistance and continuously exhibit a desirable photoelectric conversion efficiency without being deteriorated even upon repeated use over a long period of time under severe environmental conditions of high temperature and high humidity.In recent years, heating of the earth because of the so-called greenhouse effect due to an increase of atmospheric CO2 has been predicted. In view of this, there is an increased demand for a means of power generation capable of providing clean energy without causing CO2 buildup. In this regard, nuclear power generation has been considered to be advantageous in view of not causing CO2 buildup. However, there are problems for nuclear power generation in that it unavoidably produces radioactive wastes which are harmful for living things and there is a probability that leakage of injurious radioactive materials from the nuclear power generation system will happen when the system is damaged. Therefore, there is an increased societal demand for early realization of a power generation system capable of providing clean energy without causing CO2 buildup as in the case of thermal power generation and without
