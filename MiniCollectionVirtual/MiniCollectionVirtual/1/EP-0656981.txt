<ABSTRACT>
In a building (1) for the automatic entry and exit of items or motor vehicles (3) with several superimposed and adjacent storage spaces, several conveyors for transporting the vehicles (3) and several entry and exit compartments arranged in a separate plane, the entries and exits form accessways to the conveyor. The entries and exits in the entry and exit plane are staggered in such a way that there are at least two mutual parallel passageways (8) or conveyor tracks in this plane which run at an angle to the longitudinal extension of the individual entry and exit compartments. It is thus possible to arrange any number of storage spaces adjacent to, behind and above one another without the need for free spaces between storage spaces arranged one behind the other. In particular, the space above and/or beneath the entry and exit ways can be largely used for storage spaces. The passageways (8) can be used at the same time as entry and exit ways, in one direction only.
