<ABSTRACT>
A shaving system (10) with a blade member (16) with a cutting edge (18) of wedge shape that is defined by main facets (96, 98) with an included facet angle in the range of 10-17 DEG  in the region forty micrometers from the cutting edge (18). The blade (16) is mounted between leading and trailing skin-engaging surfaces (14, 26) so that the blade tangent angle (106) is less than 20 DEG  and the interior main facet (84) of the blade (16) is disposed at an angle of more than 150 DEG  to a reference line (108) that extends from the cutting edge (18) of the blade (16) to the skin-engaging point next forward of the blade edge (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shaving
systems, and more particularly to shaving systems
of the wet shave type.A shaving system of the wet shave type
includes at least one blade structure and a
surface for engaging the user's skin adjacent the
blade edge or edges. Typically, the shaving
system includes a leading skin-engaging surface
(forward of the cutting edge of the blade
structure) and a trailing skin-engaging surface
(rearwardly of the blade unit structure). The
leading skin-engaging surface may be referred to
as a guard surface and the trailing skin-engaging
surface may be referred to as a cap surface. The
skin-engaging surfaces cooperate with the blade
edge or edges and have one or more functions such
as definition of shaving geometry, tensioning of
skin in the region to be shaved, and/or delivery
of shaving aid material to the skin surface during
the shaving stroke. The shaving system may be of
the disposable cartridge type adapted for coupling
to and uncoupling from a razor handle or may be
integral with a handle so that the complete razor
is discarded as a unit when the blade or blades
become dulled.A razor blade typically is formed of a 
suitable substrate material such as metal or
ceramic, and an edge of wedge-shape configuration
is formed with an ultimate tip that has a radius
of less than about 1,000 angstroms. During use,
the razor blade typically is held in a razor at an
angle of approximately 25° to the skin surface and
the blade is moved over the skin surface so that
when the edge encounters a beard hair, it enters
and severs that hair by progressive penetration,
aided by a wedging action. It is believed that
the cut portion of the hair (which on average
is about one hundred micrometers in diameter)
remains pressed in contact with the blade facets
remote from the facial skin surface from a
penetration up to only about half the hair
diameter. Beyond this, the hair can bend away
from the blade to relieve the wedging forces. The
resistance to penetration through reaction between
hair and blade facets therefore occurs only over
about the first sixty micrometers of the blade tip
back from the edge, and the geometry of the blade
tip in this region may be regarded as being the
most important from the cutting point of view. It
is believed that a reduction in the included angle
of the facets would correspondingly reduce
resistance to continued penetration of the blade
tip into the hair. However, reduction of the
included facet angle tends to reduce the strength
of the blade tip, so that tip tends to

A razor including a body member (10, 32), at least
one blade member (16, 20) carried by said body member, a

guard member (14, 42) carried by said body member and having
a first skin-engaging surface disposed forwardly of said at

least one blade member, and a second skin-engaging surface
(24, 36) disposed rearwardly of said at least one blade

member, each said at least one blade member including a steel
substrate having a wedge-shaped cutting edge (18, 50) defined

by converging facets, said substrate having a layer of

said at least one blade member being mounted between said
first and second skin-engaging surfaces so that its

respective blade tangent angle is less than 20° and its
respective said interior main facet is disposed at an angle

of more than 150° to a reference line defined as extending
from said cutting edge of said blade member to a point on

said first skin-engaging surface forward of said cutting
edge, said layer of strengthening material defining an

ultimate tip (100) formed by ultimate tip facets (92, 94)
each having a length of between 0.1 and 0.2 micrometers and

defining an included angle of at least 60°.
A razor according to claim 1, characterized in that
said strengthening material has a thickness of at least

twelve hundred angstroms.
A razor according to claim 2, characterized in that
the layer of strengthening material (90) is diamond or
