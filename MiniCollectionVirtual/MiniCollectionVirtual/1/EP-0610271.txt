An actuator arrangement for scanning and/or recording an item of 
information which is, or is to be, recorded as a track or as tracks on a recording 

medium (AT) which is moved relative thereto using a scanning and/or recording 
head (AK), including a carrier (T) which accommodates the scanning and/or 

recording head (AK) and which is connected via a compliant support to a base 
plate (BP) and is deflectable by moving means which are connected to a control 

or regulating device and which guide the scanning and/or recording head (AK) 
in the optimum position with respect to the recording medium (AT), 

characterised in that the compliant support contains at least one resilient moulded 
part (F) in such a way that the optical axis of the scanning and/or recording head 

(AK) can be subject to parallel displacement and can be deflected through at least 
one angle by moving means. 
An actuator arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that 
the resilient moulded apart (F) is a part of synthetic material or rubber that is 

elastically deformable in at least one direction and/or through an angle. 
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the 
resilient moulded parts (F) are synthetic material or rubber sections which are 

arranged symmetrically and have a step-like shape. 
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the 
compliant resilient support is formed from a combination of two resilient 

moulded parts (F1, F2) having two holding devices (H1, H2) forming a parallel 
guide and the resilient moulded parts (F1, F2) are arranged in the connection 

between the holding devices (H1, H2) and the carrier (T). 
An actuator arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that 
the resilient moulded part (F) is formed as a single piece which incorporates both  

 
the compliant support and the carrier (T). 
An actuator arrangement in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that 
the active moving means are coils (Sp) that are arranged on the carrier (T) or on 

the resilient moulded part (F) which simultaneously forms the carrier (T) and that 
are connected to a control or regulating device, with which coils there is 

associated at least one respective permanent magnet (M) as a passive moving 
means. 
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that for 
deflecting the scanning and/or recording head (AK) in the focusing direction (z) 

and through angles in the planes which the focusing direction (z) forms with the 
radial direction (x) and the tangential direction (y), there are provided four 

individually controllable coils (Sp1 ... Sp4) which are arranged in pairs 
symmetrical to the tangential direction (y) and symmetrical to the radial direction 

(x). 
An arrangement in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that the 
spacing between the coils (Sp2, Sp3; Sp1, Sp4) which are arranged in pairs 

symmetrical to the tangential direction (y) is smaller than the spacing between the 
coils (Sp1, Sp2; Sp3, Sp4) which are arranged in pairs symmetrical to the radial 

direction (x).
