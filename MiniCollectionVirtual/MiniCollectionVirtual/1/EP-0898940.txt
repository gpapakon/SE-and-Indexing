<ABSTRACT>
A catheter adapted to perform electrophysiological procedures comprises
a body member, a manipulation handle attached to the proximal end of the body

member for applying torque to the body member, the handle having a control
knob adapted for control movements in a first plane and in a second plane

simultaneously. A deflection control line is attached at its distal end to the distal
portion of the catheter and its proximal end attached to the control device of the

handle so that tension applied to the control line by sliding the control knob causes
deflection of the distal portion of the catheter. A stiffening member is disposed

within the body member of the catheter and is slidable, said stiffening member
providing increased rigidity to the portion of the body member in which the

stiffening member is located. Rotation of the control knob controls the position
of the stiffening member in the body member. In a further aspect, a stiffening

member in accordance with one embodiment includes a tapered distal end section
with a ball formed on the distal tip, the tapered section terminating at the ball.

In accordance with another aspect, the torsional rigidity of the catheter body is
increased by use of a layer of aramid fibers mixed with an epoxy. In yet another

feature, the handle and rotatable sliding element are symmetrically shaped to
facilitate complete single-handed operation of the handle by the physician of all

position control aspects of the catheter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to catheters, and more particularly, to
steerable catheters for performing electrophysiological procedures, such as
mapping electrical signals emitted from conductive cardiac tissue and ablating
aberrant cardiac tissue at the point of arrhythmia origination in order to terminate
the arrhythmia.The heart beat in a healthy human is controlled by the sinoatrial node (S-A
node) located in the wall of the right atrium. The S-A node generates action
potentials which are transmitted through pathways of conductive heart tissue in the
atrium to the atrioventricular node (A-V node) which in turn transmits the signals
throughout the ventricle by means of the His and Purkinje conductive tissues.
Improper growth of or damage to the conductive tissue in the heart can interfere
with the passage of electrical signals from the S-A and A-V nodes resulting in
disturbances to the normal rhythm of the heart, referred to as cardiac arrhythmia.If the arrhythmia is refractory to medication, an alternative treatment is to
ablate the aberrant conductive tissue. However, that aberrant tissue must first be
located. One technique involves the electrical mapping of signals emanating from
conductive cardiac tissue to locate the aberrant tissue causing the arrhythmia.
Ablation may then be performed. Ablation of the aberrant conductive tissue
usually controls the arrhythmia and allows the heart rhythm to return to an
acceptable level. One conventional method for mapping the electrical signals from
conductive heart tissue is to provide an array of electrodes on the distal extremity
of a catheter and place those electrodes in contact with the interior of a patient's
heart. Typically, the catheter is introduced into the cardiovascular system of the
patient through a blood vessel and advanced to an endocardial site such as the
atrium or ventricle of the heart. When placed into the blood vessel, the catheter
must follow the irregularly shaped path defined by the blood vessel and branch
vessels until the distal end of the catheter reaches the desired location. To assist
in steering the catheter, some catheters have a curved distal tip. While this preformed
curve may fit the curves of some blood vessels, it rarely fits all anatomical
possibilities. Greater freedom of movement is desirable.To achieve greater control over the movement of the catheter in steering
it through the cardiovascular system to the desired location in the patient, prior
catheters have used guide wires to selectively vary the shape of the

A method of detecting electrical impulses at a selected location in a patient
using a catheter which has a body member (11) having a proximal end and a deflectable distal

end, the distal end including a sensing element for detecting electrical impulses, and the catheter
also having a stiffening member (31) disposed within the body member (11) and slidable in a

direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body member (11), said stiffening member (31)
providing increased rigidity to the portion of the body member (11) in which the stiffening

member (31) is located, the catheter further having a selectively movable control device (43)

to the longitudinal axis of the manipulation handle (40) and rotatable around the axis of the

manipulation handle (40) for selective simultaneous control of the deflection of the distal end of
the body member (11) and the location of the stiffening member (31) within the body member

introducing the distal end of the catheter into a patient;
advancing the distal end of the catheter towards the selected location in the patient;
deflecting the distal end of the catheter by manipulating the selectively movable control
device (43) to deflect the distal end of the catheter and to change the location of the stiffening

member (31) within the catheter to alter the radius of deflection of the distal end of the catheter.
