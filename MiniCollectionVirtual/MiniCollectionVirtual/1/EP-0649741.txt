<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for changing over from collecting operation to non-collecting operation on a cutting/collecting cylinder (4) of a folding apparatus for rotary printing machines, which can be changed over from collecting operation to non-collecting operation and vice versa. At least one row of puncture needles (7) is accommodated in the cutting/collecting cylinder (4), it being possible for the mounting shaft (9) of said puncture needles to be activated via a cam roller (41) which rolls in a cam body (27). The cam body (27) is accommodated adjustably in the housing (25) of the folding apparatus such that it is located opposite an end side of the cutting/collecting cylinder (4). The invention is distinguished in that the circumferential-speed ratio of cutting/collecting cylinder (4) to cam body (27) can be changed by a coaxially movable, second force-transmission element (34) which passes through a first force-transmission element (29) with at least two force-introduction points (29a, 29b).

Device for changing over collecting operation to
non-collecting operation on a cutting/collecting cylinder

(4) of a folding apparatus for rotary printing machines,
which can be changed over from collecting operation to

non-collecting operation and vice versa and in which at
least one row of puncture needles (7) is accommodated, it

being possible for the mounting shaft (9) of said
puncture needles to be activated via a cam roller (41)

which rolls in a cam body (27) which is accommodated
adjustably on the housing (25) of the folding apparatus

such that it is located opposite an end side of the
cutting/collecting cylinder (4), characterized in that a

force-transmission element (29) has an outer force-initiation
location (29a) and an inner force-initiation

location (29b) and has a coaxially arranged, axially
displaceable second force-transmission element (34)

passing through it and, on engagement with the inner
force-initiation location (29b), drives the cam body (27)

at a first relative circumferential speed with respect to
the cylinder (4) and, upon engagement with the outer

force-initiation location (29a), drives the cam body (27)
at a second relative circumferential speed with respect

to the cylinder (4).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the second force-transmission element (34) can be

displaced axially on a shaft continuation (35) of the

cutting/collecting cylinder (4).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first force-transmission element (29) comprises

a first force-introduction point which is designed as an 
outer toothing arrangement (29a).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first force-transmission element (29) comprises

a second force-introduction point which is designed as an
inner toothing arrangement (29b).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the cam body (27) is fastened on the first force-transmission

element (29).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first force-transmission element (29) is

accommodated rotatably in bearings of a side wall bushing
(33).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first force-transmission element (29) is mounted

rotatably on the shaft continuation (35) by means of a
bearing.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that mounted parallel to the shaft continuation (35) in

the side wall bushing (33) is a stub shaft which receives
a first toothing arrangement (43) and a second toothing

arrangement (42) connected thereto.
Device according to the preceding claims,
characterized in that the second force-transmission

element (34) can be brought into engagement with the
first toothing arrangement (43), as a result of which the

second toothing arrangement (42) meshes with the outer
toothing arrangement (29a) of the first force-transmission

element (29).
Device according to the preceding claims,
characterized in that the second force-transmission

element (34) can be brought into engagement with the
inner toothing arrangement (29a) of the first force-transmission

element (29).
Device according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the second force-transmission

element (34) can be locked, in its axial
positions on the shaft continuation (35), in latching

grooves (37, 38) of an actuating shaft (39).
Device according to one or more of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that a marking (32) on the

housing (25) can be made to coincide with a marking (36)
on the circumference of the cutting/collecting cylinder

(4).
