<ABSTRACT>
A spiral wound liquid separation device enclosed within a housing 
and a cover for the housing is provided with a seal which separates liquid 

feed to the device from liquid retentate produced by the device. The seal is 
of unitary construction with one end sealed to the outside surface of the 

spiral wound separation device and with a second end positioned between 
the housing and the cover under compression.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sealing means for a spiral wound filtration 
apparatus such as in reverse osmosis or ultrafiltration apparatus. At the present time, liquid separation apparatus such as filtration or 
reverse osmosis apparatus including a spiral wound cartridge are utilized in 
separation processes for liquids. The spiral wound cartridge is formed by 
interleaving one or more membrane layers, one or more spacer layers and 
one or more liquid impermeable layers about a central hollow core which 
functions as an outlet for permeate. The cartridge includes a sealing 
configuration which prevents admixture of permeate with either feed or 
retentate. The cartridge is positioned within a housing wherein feed is 
introduced axially into the cartridge, retentate is removed axially from the 
cartridge and permeate is recovered by way of the central hollow core 
which is in fluid communication with a fluid outlet in a cover which also 
seals the cartridge within the housing. At the present time, the feed is 
sealed from the retentate by a chevron-shaped elastomeric seal which is 
interposed between the outside surface of the cartridge and the inside 
surface of the housing for the cartridge in a manner to seal the feed inlet 
from the retentate outlet. An O-ring, spaced apart from the chevron-shaped 
seal, is positioned between the cover for the housing and the 
housing to prevent feed leakage from the housing prior to its being passed 
through the spiral wound cartridge. Unfortunately, the chevron-shaped 
seal has a tendency to fail under the normal operating conditions of 
pressure and fluid flow primarily due to incomplete sealing at the inside 
wall of the housing and the seal surface contacting the inside wall of the 
housing.  
 U.S.-A-4,594,161 describes a seal structure for a reverse osmosis 
apparatus wherein a seal is effected between a housing for a spiral wound 
cartridge and a cover for the housing. Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a sealing means which 
prevents a feed liquid from by-passing a liquid separation means prior to 
being removed as retentate. Such a sealing means would permit more 
efficient liquid separation processes which utilize a spiral wound separation 
cartridge. The present invention provides a seal for use in conjunction with a 
spiral wound liquid separation device which includes a filtration membrane 
such as an ultrafiltration membrane or a semipermeable reverse osmosis 
membrane. The spiral wound separation device is positioned with a 
housing, and a

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for separating a feed liquid into a permeate liquid and 
a retentate liquid which comprises:
 
   a spiral wound liquid separation device (16) which includes a separation 

membrane and means for recovering a permeate liquid,
 
   a housing (28) for said spiral wound liquid separation device,
 
   a cover (32) cooperating with said housing (28) to enclose said spiral wound 

liquid separation device (16)
 
   a seal (10) being of unitary construction and having a first surface (12) 

adhered to an outside surface of said spiral wound liquid separation device 
about the circumference of said separation device, said seal having a free 

end (22) positioned between said housing (28) and said cover (32),
 
   said seal (10) being positioned to effect sealing between a feed liquid 

entering said separation device from an inlet (38) in said cover (32) and a retentate 

liquid removed from said housing and
 
   means (54) in said cover for removing a permeate liquid from said 

separation device while preventing admixture of said permeate liquid with 
said feed liquid or said retentate liquid. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said free end (22) of said seal has an 
essentially O-shaped cross-section. 
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2 wherein the spiral wound liquid 
separation device (16) is a reverse osmosis device.  

 
The apparatus of claim 1 or 2 wherein the spiral wound liquid 
separation device (16) is a ultrafiltration device.
