<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a system of interchangeable impression copings for use with osseointegrated implant systems. The coping system will allow an accurate registration of the fixture head, abutment, healing abutment, or other prefabricated components to which the implant may be connected. The coping  system also permits the direct substitution of each of the various impression copings within an index or impression, so as to transfer, translate or transform the relations and/or the type of component to a model adapted from an index or poured from an impression registered using the coping system.

<DESCRIPTION>
Osseointegrated implants are fixtures commonly screwed into prepared sites in the jaw, facial, or limb bones for the retention of prostheses, e.g. dental bridges, facial prostheses, or limb prostheses. Such prostheses are usually retained by means of screws, adhesives, or mechanical attachments to an abutment, which is itself precisely located on and connected to the fixture by means of an abutment screw.An abutment is a trans-mucosal, or trans-dermal component, usually fabricated from a highly bio-compatible material capable of developing some kind of stable union with the adjacent living tissues, which facilitates the connection of the prosthesis to the fixture. Abutments may have a precise, prefabricated external configuration which will allow the use of prefabricated "prosthetic" components which precisely fit against the abutment for the fabrication of the prosthesis framework, or the abutment may be intended for preparation, in which case a framework may be constructed using conventional dental crown and bridge impression and fabrication techniques. Alternatively, a prosthesis may be fixed directly to the fixture head, using prefabricated "prosthetic" components which precisely fit against the fixture for the fabrication of the framework.Figure (1) illustrates a typical dental implant, and associated components by way of example. The head of the fixture (1) is provided with a hexagonal external feature (2), and a screw recess(3), which together allow the fixture to be manipulated, and permit the connection of an abutment (4), by means of an abutment screw (5). If the abutment is designed to allow screw retention of a prosthesis, the head of the abutment screw may itself contain a recess (6) for a prosthesis retention screw.Figure (2) illustrates abutments of a type commonly used to support dental prostheses. Both abutment types are connected to the fixture by means of an abutment screw (7 and 8). One abutment type (9) is designed for cementation of a restoration onto a suitably shaped part (10), and another type, (11a and 11b) is designed for screw retention of the restoration by means of a "prosthetic" screw which is screwed through the restoration into an appropriate recess in the abutment screw head (12). The abutment length in each case is 1. Apart from differences in general shape, abutments of each type are available in different lengths, as illustrated (11a and 11b).The fixtures are usually placed as either a one stage surgical procedure, in which case the fixture, or an abutment connected

<CLAIMS>
A system of interchangeable impression copings (24, 26) together with abutments (25), for use with osseointegrated implants (1) which will allow an accurate registration of the fixture head, abutment, healing abutment, or other prefabricated components to which the implant may be connected, and permits the direct substitution of each of the various impression copings within an index or impression, so as to transfer, translate, or transform the relations and or the type of component to a model adapted from an index or poured from an impression registered using the coping system,

the impression copings (24, 26) having a component fitting surface with a form and width which permits the coping to precisely locate over a fixture head, abutment, healing abutment or other prefabricated components, and a height (h), the abutments (25) having outer contours fitting to the copings and the fixture heads, and a length (l),
characterised in that
 the height (h) of the copings (24, 26) vary in dependence of the length (l) of the abutments, such that the total height (hf) of the coping (24, 26) with the abutment (25), is equal to a standardised value.
