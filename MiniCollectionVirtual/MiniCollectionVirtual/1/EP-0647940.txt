<ABSTRACT>
A disc player (1000) has a magazine (50) for storing discs and a disc 
transport 

mechanism transporting a selected disc between a playback po 
sition outside the 

magazine and a store position located within the magazine. The 
carriages (51-57) are 

stacked upon each other and pivotally supported within the magazine. 
The 

carriages are extracted from the stack by lifting a front end of a 
carriage above 

a selected carriage. Subsequent to the lifting of the carriage, 
the selected 

carriage is withdrawn from the magazine to the playback position. 
When a 

selected carriage is moved to the playback position, the discs on 
carriages 

above and below the selected carriage are prevented from shifting 
with the 

removal of the selected carriage by coaxial opposing shafts which 
extend 

through spindle holes in the discs on the carriages above and 
below the 

selected disc. A closeable gap between the two shafts permits 
the selected disc 

to be shifted. The gap is closed, except when a carriage is 
being shifted into 

or out of the magazine, thereby preventing discs and their carriages 
from 

shifting due to vibration or tilting of the cabinet. When the device 
is in a stop 

mode, the magazine shifts to pierce any carriages capable of holding 
discs of 

different sizes, thereby preventing smaller disc from moving into 
recesses for 

larger discs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a disc player having a magazine for
holding a plurality of discs, and which is capable of continuous playback of
discs from the magazine. In particular, the disc player of the present invention
has a magazine with a securing mechanism for preventing displacement of
discs within the magazine due to vibration or inclination of the disc player.EP-A-0 632 443 discloses a disc player in which a security
device prevents vibrations from moving discs within a magazine. In that
device, upper and lower disc-lock shafts engage disc spindle holes and the
carriages which support each disc. A closable gap between the upper and
lower disc-lock shafts is used, when opened, to pass a single disc from the
magazine into playback and eject positions.This document is state of the art pursuant to Article 54(3) EPC.A drawback of the above is that the mechanism which closes the gap
between the upper and lower disc-lock shafts only does so during the eject
mode of operation. This created a difficulty in that the security mechanism
ineffective during playback and stop modes.A further drawback of the above is that the first carriage, located at the
lower end of the magazine, has a first 12 cm diameter cavity and a second 8
cm cavity for mounting large and small discs, respectively. When the first
carriage is disposed in the gap between the upper and lower disc-lock shafts, 
the shafts do not pierce effectively the spindle hole in the disc. This is not a
problem with a 12 cm in the carriage, since the depression in the carriage,
together with the underside of the next-higher carriage, prevents unwanted
motion of the 12 cm disc. With an 8cm disc in the second 8cm cavity in the
carriage, vibration or incline of the device could dislodge the disc from the
8cm cavity into the 12 cm cavity. In some cases this can jam the disc player
components and damage the disc.It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a
changer-type disc playback device which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior
art.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a security
mechanism to prevent discs stored within a magazine from unwanted motion
due to the effects of vibrations or inclines during all modes of operation of the
disc player.It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a disc
playback device which returns its magazine to a position of rest, engaging the
security mechanism, during its stop mode to ensure that 8 cm discs are
properly secured within the security
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A disc player for storing discs, each having a
spindle hole (163), and playing a selected disc of said

discs, comprising

a magazine (50) movable in an up/down direction;
said magazine (50) including at least first means (52-57) for
holding a disc of a first size;
said magazine (50) including at least second means (51) for
holding a disc of either said first size or a second smaller size, the disc of said second size being held in a position within said second means which is lower than that of a disc of said first size;
a playback position;
means for reading said selected disc in said playback
position;
means for transporting said selected disc between said
playback position an a store position in said magazine

(50);
each of said discs (1-7) being movable together with said magazine (50) and having
a store position disposed substantially in a plane defined

by said playback position;
a first shaft (250), extending downward through a top
portion of said magazine (50), extending through said

spindle holes (163) of said discs disposed in said magazine
(50) above said plane to secure said discs (1-7) in said

magazine (50);
a second shaft (251), extending upward through a bottom
portion of said magazine (50) coaxial with said first shaft

(250), extending through said spindle holes (163) of said
discs disposed in said magazine below said plane to secure

said discs in said magazine (50);
a closeable gap aligned between said first and second
shafts with said plane;
retracting means for shifting said second shaft (251)
axially to lock with said first shaft (250) to secure all

discs in said magazine; 
means, responsive to a stop mode of operation when said gap is open, for
moving said magazine (50) to a rest position where one of

said first and second shafts (250, 251) pierce said
second means.
A disc player according to claim 1 wherein

said second means
is disposed at a lower end of said magazine; and
said second shaft pierces said second means
when said magazine is in

said rest position.
A disc player according to claim 1 or 2 wherein
said retracting means are responsive for shifting said

second shaft (251) axially to lock with first shaft (250)
to secure all discs in said magazine (50) except when a

disc is shifted into or out of said magazine.
