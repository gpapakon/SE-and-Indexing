<ABSTRACT>
A tape printing apparatus having a detection member 
which detects movement of a tape cutter to its tape cutting 

direction. A control system is provided for stopping 
tape feeding and tape printing operation when the detection 

member detects the movement of the tape cutter for 
preventing the print tape from being entangled with an 

internal mechanical component. Printing operation for one 
train of dots read from a print buffer is performed when a 

print key is operated and the count value of a tape feed 
counter is incremented by 1 dot. Such steps are repeatedly 

performed if no cutting operation is made by means of a 
cutting control button and If tape feed count value is 

not coincident with cut position data, and if a sequence 
of printing processes have not yet been completed. On the 

other hand, if the cutting control button is operated 
while a printing operation is being performed, the printing 

operation and tape feeding operation are stopped. If 
the cutting operation is completed, tape is automatically 

fed by a predetermined length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape printing
apparatus having a manual tape cutting device.One example of a conventional tape printing apparatus
is described in a Japanese Utility Model Application Kokai
No. Hei 1-85050. The conventional device includes a keyboard,
a display, a printing mechanism having a thermal
head, and a tape feed mechanism. A tape cassette accommodating
therein an elongated printing medium such as a
tape having a width of 12 mm or 18 mm is installed in the
printing apparatus. Intended characters and symbols are
input through the keyboard, and the printing mechanism
performs label-printing on the tape with characters and
symbols input through the keyboard. The tape printing
apparatus is further provided with various editing functions.Within the tape cassette, a tape spool, a ribbon
supply spool, a ribbon takeup spool, and another supply
spool are rotatably provided. A laminate film tape as the
printing medium is wound around the tape spool, a print
ribbon is wound around the ribbon supply spool, and a
double-coated tape to be stuck to the laminate film tape 
is wound around the other supply spool. Further, in the
tape cassette, a platen roller and various rollers are
rotatably supported. The platen roller is adapted for
pressing the laminate film tape and the print ribbon
against the thermal head.When electrical current is supplied to the thermal
head while the tape feed mechanism is driven to rotate the
plurality of spools, characters and symbols formed of
trains of dots are printed on the laminate film tape, and
then, the double-coated tape is attached to the laminate
film tape to thereby form a print tape, and the print tape
is fed to the outside of the tape printing apparatus.Also proposed is a tape printing apparatus with a
simplified manual cutting device installed at a position
adjacent an outlet of the printed tape, the cutting device
facilitating cutting of the printed tape at a desired
position. The manual cutting device has a simple mechanism
adapted to cut the printed tape easily and neatly
with a pair of scissors including a movable blade and a
stationary blade by depressing a cutting button.In the tape printing apparatus provided with the
above described simplified manual cutting device, the
print tape can be cut at any timing regardless of during
the printing operation where the tape feed mechanism and
the thermal head are controlledly driven. Accordingly, 
when a cutting operation is made by mistake while a printing
operation is being performed, the tape printed
