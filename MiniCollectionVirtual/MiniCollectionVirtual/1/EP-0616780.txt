<ABSTRACT>
A natural carob fibre and a procedure for its 
production. The fibre comprises 50-65 % lignin, 15-25 % 

cellulose, 15-25 % hemicellulose, 0.5-2 % pectin, 3-7 % 
tannins and 4-8 % moisture. The procedure comprises the 

pressing of the waste pulp obtained in the operation of 
extracting the sugars from carob pulp.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new natural
product derived from the carob, and which corresponds to
the water insoluble fraction of the pulp obtained after
eliminating all the water soluble material, followed by
drying and grinding to the granulometry corresponding to
each market and use.More particularly, the invention relates to a new
natural carob fibre (NCF) and a procedure for its
production.The field of application of the invention
corresponds to the dietetics sector and the human food
sector.The fibres currently on the market are obtained
mainly from cereals and are applied both to the field of 
dietetics and that of human food.The effects which fibre has on the diet are well
known in the field of nutrition. Equally well recognized
is the lack of fibre in modern diets due to changes in
traditional dietary customs. Equally well known is the
influence which fibre has on the capture of fats in the
intestine. Furthermore, the relationship between lipaemia
and the ingesta of fat is generally accepted nowadays, as
is its relationship to cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality whilst within this ingesta the cholesterol
content and the type of fat in the diet are clear risk
factors.The NCF fibre according to the present invention
provides the market with a new product which, since it
has the same nutritional characteristics as currently
known fibres, practically duplicates the hypocholesterolaemiant
effect, enabling the consequences of modern
cholesterol-rich diets to be partially counteracted.The patent application bY the same applying Entity,
presented on the same date and entitled "A syrup
consisting of the natural carob sugars and a process for
its production", describes and claims a new process for
extracting and purifying the juice derived from the carob
pulp to obtain on the one hand a natural syrup of the
carob sugars and on the other a waste pulp which contains
the insoluble fraction of the carob pulp.The object of the present invention is to provide a
new process which, starting the above mentioned waste
pulp, enables a new natural carob fibre (NCF) to be
obtained.Therefore, according to a first aspect, the
invention relates to a new process for obtaining said 
natural carob fibre and consists of the following phases:The fruit from the fields is normally accompanied by
a series of foreign elements such as stones, twigs,
metallic elements, as well as the earth which sticks to
the carob particularly if it was harvested during a rainy
period.The first operation consists of cleaning the carob
of
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A natural carob fibre with hypocholesterolaemiant
properties characterized in that it has the following

composition:

Lignin
50-65 %
Cellulose
15-25 %
Hemicellulose
15-25 %
Pectin
0.5-2 %
Tannins
3-7 %
Moisture
4-8 %

where the percentages are expressed in weight and are
within certain limits depending on the fruit (variety,

harvest, agricultural land, etc.), except for the
moisture which depends on the applications.
A process for obtaining the natural carob fibre
according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises

the following stages:

a) The fruit from the field is subjected to
mechanical operations to separate the foreign elements,

it is washed in water and dried by a current of air;
b) The pods are cut up sufficiently to release the
seed, preferably until they pass through a sieve with a

hole diameter of 12 to 20 mm:
c) The cut up material obtained in the previous
stage is subjected to a separation-sieving operation to

separate on the one hand the seeds and on the other the
pulp, said pulp being subjected to classification,

preferably until it has a granulometry of less than 10
mm.
d) The pulp, cut up to the appropriate granulometry,
is subjected to a continuous extraction process in which

the pulp is put in contact with the diffusion water for
the minimum amount of time necessary, in order to avoid

the proliferation of microorganisms, to obtain on the one 
hand a raw juice, with a concentration of between 30 and

50 °Brix, and on the other a pulp which constitutes the
insoluble fraction of the carob pulp.
e) The waste pulp is pressed in order to extract a
substantial part of the water it carries, said water

still containing in solution sugars and various non-sugars
and being recycled for the extraction of sugars in

the previous stage;
f) The fibre obtained in the pressing stage is
broken up by passing it over a mill which leaves it

loose;
g) The moist fibre is dried until its water content
is less than 5%;
h) The dry fibre is ground into a flour with a
granulometry of between 300 und 56
µ
m (or 50 and 250 mesh (ASTM E11-70));
and
i) The flour is sieved ready to be packed, the
rejected material being re-fed to the grinding operation.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that during the extraction process of stage d), the time

for which the pulp remains in contact with the diffusion
water is 1 to 3 hours, at a temperature of 15 to 30°C and

at a pH of between 4.6 and 5.4.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that during the pressing process of stage e), the pH is

maintained between 5 and 6.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that the process of stage f) is carried out at room

temperature.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in
that stage g) is carried out at temperatures of 120 +

10°C.
The use of the natural carob fibre according to
claim 1 in dietetic and food applications.
The use of the carob fruit for obtaining the 
natural fibre according to the procedure in claims 2 to
