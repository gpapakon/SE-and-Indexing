<ABSTRACT>
The use of water-soluble or water-dispersible polyurethanes of a) at least one compound containing two or more active hydrogen atoms per molecule, b) at least one diol containing acid or salt groups, and c) at least one diisocyanate, with a glass transition temperature of at least 15  C and acid numbers from 12 to 150, or the salts of these polyurethanes as auxiliary agents in cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations and water-soluble or water-dispersible polyurethanes which (a) contain at least 5 mol% of a polycondensate of lactic acid and a polyol of general formula (IV) in which Y is a radical of a di to quadrivalent alcohol, n is 1-50 and m is 1-4.

<CLAIMS>
The use of polyurethanes which are soluble or 
dispersible in water and are composed of 


a) at least one compound which contains two or more 
active hydrogens per molecule, 
b) at least one diol containing acid groups or salt 
groups and 
c) at least one diisocyanate 
 
with a glass transition temperature of at least 15°C and 

acid numbers of from 12 to 150 or the salts of these 
polyurethanes in cosmetic compositions and as binders or 

coating agents in pharmaceutical compositions. 
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein diols, 
diamines, polyesterols, polyetherols or mixtures thereof 

with a molecular weight (number average) of in each case 
up to 3000 are used as compounds in group (a), it being 

possible to replace up to 3 mol % of said compounds by 
triols or triamines.
