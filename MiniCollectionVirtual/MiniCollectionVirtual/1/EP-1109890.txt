<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for producing human cloned embryos by employing inter-species nuclear transplantation technique. The method for producing human cloned embryos of the invention comprises the steps of: preparing donor somatic cell lines collected from human; maturing oocytes collected from ovary of cow in vitro; removing the cumulus cells surrounding the oocytes; cutting a portion of zona pellucida of the matured oocytes to make a slit, and squeezing out a portion of cytoplasm including the first polar body through the slit to give enucleated recipient oocytes; transferring a nucleus to the recipient oocyte by injection of the donor cells to the enucleated recipient oocytes, followed by the subsequent electrofusion and activation of the electrofused cells to give embryos; and, postactivating and culturing the embryos in vitro. The human cloned embryos of the invention can be employed to obtain the human embryonic stem cells, which may be widely applied in biological and medical fields.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method For Producing Human Cloned Embryos By Employing Inter-species Nuclear Transplantation TechniqueBACKG OUND OF THF. TNVF.NTTONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method for producing human cloned embryos by employing inter-species nuclear transplantation technique, more specifically, a method for producing human cloned embryos by employing inter-species nuclear transplantation technique by which nuclei of somatic cells derived from human tissue are transferred into mature oocytes originated from cow. It also relates to human cloned embryos produced by the method described above.Rar. σnund of the InventionAnimals have long been considered to be produced by fertilization involving male and female gametes. However, tremendous efforts have been made on generating cloned animals with the identical appearance and genetic characteristics.Recently, various recombinant plants with desired characters of useful crops have been successfully produced due to the developments in biotechnology and genetic engineering (£e_e_: Schweizer et al., Plant Journal, 20:541- 552, 1999). From animal's side, there have been many successful examples in production of cloned animals which include, for example, cloned lambs (see: Wilmut et al . , Nature, 385:810-813, 1997), cloned co s(i≤≤: Wells et al . , Reprod. Fertil. and Develop., 10:369-378, 1998) and cloned mice (.s_£e.: Wakayama et al., Nature, 394:369-374, 1998). Since production of cloned animals cannot be realized without high technology built up on the biotechnology, it 

 has been considered to be a standard to assess the technological development in the related fields.Meanwhile, animal stem cells have been known to have potency of development to every organ, which prompted the research on the mechanism of their differentiation to each organ by obtaining and culturing them. When this research is conducted, it is important to employ materials with the identical tissue-specificity to reduce variations among many different studies. However, it is obvious that suitable materials with the identical tissue-specificity are not available all the time. Although the cloning technique employing somatic cells has facilitated the supply of materials with the identical tissue-specificity recently, it was less satisfactory in case of human tissue. Under the circumstances, there have been strong reasons for developing a method for obtaining human embryonic stem cells with the identical tissue-specificity.Summary of the InventionIn accordance with the present
