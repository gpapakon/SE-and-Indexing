<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a chronograph mechanism capable of functioning either in the direct standard direction, or in the reverse direction to operate a countdown. The second timer (80) has a control finger (85) for incrementing and decrementing the minute timer (11). In order to prevent the control finger from operating at the start of a cycle of the second timer during a countdown operation, it is pivotally mounted on a disc (91) of said timer. Two indexable pins (95, 96) fixed on said disc are urged to abut against the respective flanks of the control finger to drive it only at the end of a cycle, respectively in one direction or the other. A spring (97) maintains the finger disengaged from the transmission wheel (84) while the duration of the countdown is being preselected.
