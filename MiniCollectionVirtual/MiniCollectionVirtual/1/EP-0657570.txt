<ABSTRACT>
Device for the take-up of long flexible material (10) from a production machine (11), especially a braiding, circular knitting or such like machine, which has a take-up drive (12), the rotational speed of which can be influenced according to a master frequency derived from a main drive (13) of the production machine (11), there being a control device making it possible to modify the master frequency or a synchronous variable derived from this. In order to improve a device having the features mentioned in the introduction, in such a way that an adjustable ratio synchronism between the rotation speeds of the main drive (13) and the take-up drive (12) is achieved by simple means, it is designed in such a way that the take-up drive (12) is a synchronous motor, the rotational speed of which is controlled via a digital frequency converter according to the master frequency derived from the main drive (13).

Device for the purpose of extracting flexible, oblong material (10) from a
manufacturing machine (11), in particular from a brading machine, circular knitting

machine or the like, which has an extraction drive (12) whose rotational speed can
be influenced according to a guide frequency (f) which is derived from a main drive

(13) of the manufacturing machine (11), wherein a control device (14) is provided
which permits the guide frequency (f) or a synchronous variable derived therefrom

to change, characterised in that the extraction drive (12) is a synchronous motor (15)

whose rotational speed is controlled by way of a digital frequency converter (16)
according to the guide frequency (f) derived from the main drive (13).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the maximum output turning
moment of the synchronous motor (15) required for the extraction operation in

accordance with the instructions is smaller than the output turning moment
corresponding to the nominal power of the synchronous motor (15) in the case of

guide frequencies in accordance with the instructions.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the maximum guide
frequency (f) is tailored to suit in accordance with the instructions the maximum

rotational speed of the synchronous motor (15) when driven in a synchronous
manner in accordance with the instructions.
Device according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a moment of momentum
transmitter (17) which acts in an incremental manner is connected to the main drive

(13) for the purpose of deriving the guide frequency (f) and the output (18) of said
transmitter is connected to the input (19) of an integrator (20) for the purpose of

producing digital rotational angle values.
Device according to any one or several of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
the output (21) of the digital integrator (20) is connected to the input (22) of a

multiplier (23) of the control device (14) which permits the digital synchronous 
variable to change.
Device according to any one or several of the claims 1 to 5, characterised in that
the output (24) of the multiplier (23) is connected to an input (25) of the digital

frequency converter (16) whose outputs (26) which issue from the rotating field
control are connected to the synchronous motor (15).
Device according to any one or several of the claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the synchronous motor (15) is provided with a error indicating or signalling device

(27) which monitors the tilting and/or inoperative state of the said synchronous
motor.
