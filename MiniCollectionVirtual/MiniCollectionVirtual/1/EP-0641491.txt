<DESCRIPTION>
 QUICK DISCONNECT WIRING CONNECTORThis invention relates to the field of cable connectors, and more particularly to an apparatus which allows two multiple-conductor cables to be quickly connected or disconnected.There are many circumstances in which it is desirable for a cable to be provided with a connector at some point along its length, such that the portions of cable on either side of the connector may be temporarily disconnecte-j :rom one another, and then re-connected. For example, in the case of telephone hea-_, ;eιs which are coupled with a cable to a stationary base unit, the wearer m„ wish to momentarily move away from the base unit without having to remove the headset or microphone.If the cable between the headset and base unit is provided with a separable connector at some point along its length, however, mobility can be achieved merely by separating the connector. Thus, in the case of a headset or microphone, the wearer can move freely about by simply disconnecting the headset from the base unit. When the wearer returns to the base unit, he can re-connect the headset to its base unit.Several important considerations must be taken into account if an effective and practical separable cable connector is to be provided. First, when the connector is connected, it must maintain continuous and affirmative electrical contact between conductors in the two connected portions of cable. While connected, normal 

movement of the cable should not cause an interruption of the electrical contact between the respective portion, of wiring. At the same time, however, the connector should not be so securely fastened as to make disconnection too difficult or time consuming. Screw-type connectors, although they may provide a durable and secure connection, are not desirable in many situations, since the rotation required to fasten and unfasten them may cause the respective portions of wiring to become twisted and knotted.Another consideration is the size and weight of the connector. If the connector is to be used for a headset cord, for example, the connector should not be so heavy or large-as to make the wearer uncomfortable. Achieving sufficiently small size and light weight in a connector may be difficult, however, particularly when the cable comprises multiple conductors. Moreover, although the connector should preferably be small and light, it should not be so fragile that it is prone to breakage during ordinary use, or after repeated connecting and disconnecting.

CLAIMS:
1. A separable, hermaphroditic connector for electrically coupling first and second multiple-conductor cables, comprising a first connector half to be disposed at an end of said first multiple-conductor cable, and a second connector half to be disposed at an end of said second multiple-conductor cable, each connector half comprising:
a housing of substantially rectangular cross-section;
a mating portion carried on said housing, the rear of said mating portion defining first and second exterior surfaces extending longitudinally with respect to said rectangular housing cross-section, said first exterior surface lying in a first plane;
a substantially planar unitary contact support platform integrally formed with said mating portion and extending longitudinally with respect to said rectangular housing cross-section, said contact support having a top surface stepped down from said first plane so as to lie in a second plane;
a plurality of metallic contact strips disposed on the underside of said unitary, substantially planar contact support, said underside defining a first wall of a substantially rectangular cavity within each said connector half, said top surface of said contact support having a semi-circular projection formed thereon, said semi-circular projection being co-planar with said first exterior surface;
a substantially planar cover integrally formed with said mating portion and disposed in a plane parallel to said contact support underside, said planar cover having sides protruding at right angles therefrom in the direction toward said contact support, said planar cover and sides defining second, third and fourth walls 


 of said cavity, said sides having curved edges, said planar cover lying in a third plane that is co-planar with said second exterior surface and having a semi-circular notch formed in a forward edge thereof;
said curved side edges being configured such that when said contact support of said second connector half is inserted into said cavity of said first connector half, said contact support of said first connector half is inserted into said cavity of said second connector half, and said curved sides of said first connector half interlock with said curved sides of said second connector half,
and when interlocked, said curved side edges holding said first and second connector halves together such that said contact strips of said first connector half are held in electrical contact with said contact strips of said second connector half, said semi-circular notch on said planar cover of said first connector half mating with said semi-circular projection on said planar contact support of said second connector half.
