<ABSTRACT>
Herein described is a new form of extraction collagen having the following characteristics: optical rotation, measured on 1 % autoclaved, in 0.5 M acetic acid, corresponding to a ((alpha))D25 =-145  +- 5, toluidine blue metachromasia = negative, it reconstitutes by neutralization even from a solution in 0.1N HCl left at 37  C during 60', it hydrolyses completely within 40 minutes by the action of pepsine, it is stable under the proteolytic action of pancreatin during over 24 hours. This form of collagen is obtained preceding its extraction from tissues by a treatment with sodium hydrate, and following extraction itself with a precipitation of collagen at pH 4.9 - 5.5 and a treatment with carbon dioxide. The thus obtained new form of collagen, among all known ones, is the closest to negative collagen and the most suitable for pharmaceutical and cosmetic use.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Extraction of collagen.The present invention Rovers a new form of collagen which, compared to known forms, is closer to native collagen. Collagen is a scleroprotein widely diffuse in animal world, such as to constitute one third of the total proteins of mammals' organism. Being the basic material of all supporting and tegumental structures of vertebrates, its chemical structure, very complex, has been the subject of intensive chemico-physical studies, with further x-ray and electronic microscope investigation. Such studies contributed in detecting the chemical structures forming collagen frame responsible for the extraordinary mechanical properties of tissues formed by collagen.Through the above studies it was possible to ascertain that histologic native collagen has a structure based on three polypeptide spiral- winding chains, each formed by about 1000 aminoaάds, called tropocollagen. To this structure other protein, polysaccharide or glycopeptide molecules, especially glycosaminoglycanes, elastin and reticuline are bound. The main studies on collagen structure and on its properties are reported by : A. Rich - Bioph. Science 1959 J. Gross - Sάen Americ 1961M. Chvapil - Biology of Collagen, Academic Press 1980. Several "collagens" for pharmaceutical use are on the market, and companies specialized in the manufacture of laboratory reagents put8UBSTITUTE SHEET 

"collagen" at disposal of researchers.However, the procedures leading to the isolation of "collagen" are based on extraction techniques forcedly drastic, and anyhow denaturating, which imply the demolition of the otherwise unattackable histological structure. The thus obtained "collagen" is therefore totally different from native collagen of which, incidentally, at least eleven structurally different types are known, but still keeps some of its characteristics.The characteristics of extractive collagen clearly depend on the extraction technique, since such technique on one hand must break bonds which are resistant in themselves, and on the other, avoid the demolition of collagen or its transformation into jelly or glue. Collagen extraction procedures are described in 153. patent 2,979,438 and in U.S. patent 2,973,302; the latter describes also its purification. According to the techniques currently in use, collagenous tissue is subjected to a swelling, with dispersion in acid medium of collagen contained in said tissue, suitably treated.In all procedures the final product is an aqueous dispersion, slightly acid - normally through acetic acid -
