<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a welded rear axle for a motor vehicle, comprising at least one main body (1), which can be articulated resiliently on a body, wheel carriers (10, 11) welded to the main body (1), and mounts (12 to 17), provided on the main body (1), for further components which determine the movements of the axle, such as stub axles, suspension arms, shock absorbers or springs, the main body (1) being a hollow body of non uniform wall thickness and cross-sectional geometry which is converted to its final shape by means of hydraulic internal high-pressure forming.

Welded motor vehicle rear axle, consisting of at least one 
main element (1) which can be linked resiliently to a van body 

and wheel carriers (10, 11) welded to the main element (1) as 
well as with receptacles (12 to 17) provided on the main 

element (1) for additional structural members which determine 
the axle movements such as legs, control arms, shock absorbers 

or springs, characterised in that the main element (1) is a 
hollow body of non-constant wall thickness and cross-sectional 

geometry which is converted to the final shape by the 
hydraulic internal high-pressure forming method and which 

contains the receptacles (12 to 17), wherein the wall 
thickness of the main element (1) is greater in the region of 

at least one receptacle (14, 15) than in the other regions (7, 
18, 19) or sections (8, 9). 
Welded motor vehicle rear axle according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the cross-section of the main element 

(1) is homogeneous over its whole length, even in regions of 
cross-sectional transitions. 
Welded motor vehicle rear axle according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the main element (1) at the ends 

comprises receptacles (12, 13) to each of which can be welded 
a wheel carrier (10, 11), these receptacles (12, 13) being of 

flat-surfaced or bulging construction. 
Welded motor vehicle rear axle according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the main element (1) has been produced 

by hydraulic internal high-pressure forming, known in the art, 
of a roughly prebent tube (32) of annular cross-sectional 

area. 
Welded motor vehicle rear axle according to claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the main element (1) for supporting the 

wheel carriers (10, 11) at the ends has in its central region 
(7) a bending-resistant but twistable cross-sectional area  

 
which is produced by mechanical pressing, known in the art, 

in combination with hydraulic internal high-pressure forming. 
Welded motor vehicle rear axle according to one or more claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that the main element (1) for 

supporting the wheel carriers (10, 11) at the ends has in its 
central region (7) a bending-resistant but twistable cross-sectional 

area, wherein the latter has already been produced 
from a tube of annular cross-section before hydraulic internal 

high-pressure forming by forming methods known in the art, and 
is preserved during hydraulic internal high-pressure forming.
