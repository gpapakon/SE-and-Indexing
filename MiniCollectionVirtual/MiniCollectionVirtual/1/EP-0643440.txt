<ABSTRACT>
An insulation displacement contact (10) comprises first and 
second contact portions each of which comprises a cantilevered 

split beam (19). The upper split beam, which receives insulated 
wires, comprises a pair of tynes (20,22) which are folded about the axis 

of a slot (25) separating the tynes such that the internal angle 
between the tynes is approximately 90Â°. The width of the tynes 

is larger than that of prior art devices resulting in increased 
stiffness and the length of the tynes is sufficiently long to 

receive two wires therebetween. 
The contacts (10) are mounted in a housing which includes a 
plurality of teeth (90) provided with 

means for retaining lugs (32,34) on the 
end of the tynes to ensure bowed opening of the tynes on 

insertion of a wire. The contacts are arranged along the central 

axis (72) of the housing such that the folded tynes of alternate 
contacts extend on opposite sides of the central axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors and in
particular to insulation displacement connectors for housing
insulation displacement contacts.Insulation displacement contacts are of particular
applicability to the voice and data communications industry.
There have been many proposals for insulation displacement
contacts (IDC) in the past. However, all prior proposals suffer
from one or more of a number of disadvantages as will be
described.The basic function of a connector block is to house a
number of insulation displacement contacts, normally 4 or 8. The
individual contacts provide at one end a pair of contacts for
attachment either to a wiring block or to individual wires and at
the other end a pair of contacts for receiving an insulated wire.
The contacts are disposed in a manner which ensures that the
insulation around the wire is stripped away or displaced as the
wire is fed between the contacts. Commonly, this has been
achieved by a cantilevered split beam where the two beam halves
are displaced by a distance less than the width of the insulation
of the wire with which the connector is to be used. The open
ends of the beams are usually shaped so that the wire can be
guided between the beam halves or tynes and a slot or opening is
provided to retain the wire, with its insulation displaced, in
contact with the connector and to give the tynes a degree of flexibility.US-A-4964812 (Siemon) discloses an IDC which comprises two
opposed cantilevered beams each of which comprises a pair of
tynes and each of which extends from a central portion. Each
tyne pair is separated by an elongate opening along a part of its
length and is formed from an original cantilevered beam by
shearing along a shear axis which forms the cutting surface for
cutting the insulation on a wire. The shear axis is conveniently
the longitudinal axis of the cantilevered beam. This shearing
produces a closed gap between the tynes of a beam. However, a
secondary closing action is necessary to achieve a satisfactorily
small gap between the tynes. This is achieved by a coining
operation performed on the outside edges at the base of the tynes
and decreased coin surfaces pre-load the beam elements whilst 
maintaining clean contact surfaces and raising the contact force
to a level where it is sufficient to penetrate the insulation on
small wires.The need for a secondary operation to close the slot to
the required dimension is undesirable and arises from an attempt
to overcome problems with beam stiffness by increasing contact
thickness.

<CLAIMS>
An insulation displacement connector comprising a
plurality of insulation displacement contacts (10), and a

housing, the contacts being received in shaped apertures (60) in
the housing and comprising first and second contact portions (14,

17), the second contact portions being arranged to receive
insulated wires and comprising a cantilevered beam (19) split

into first and second tynes (20, 22) by a slot (25) extending
along an axis of the beam, at least one tyne being folded about

the slot axis, the shaped apertures in the housing being arranged
along a central axis (72) of the housing to receive the contacts

(10), characterized in that the folded at least one tyne of alternate contacts
extends on opposite sides of the central axis.
A insulation displacement connector according to Claim
1, wherein the housing further comprises a plurality of teeth

(90) disposed on either side of the tynes and each having a
retaining wall for receiving lugs (32, 34) on the free ends of the

tynes to limit displacement of the tynes on insertion of a wire
therebetween.
An insulation displacement connector according to Claim
1 or 2, wherein each contact is received in a respective aperture

in the housing, the housing having a plurality of teeth (90) on
each side of the apertures to shield the contacts, the teeth (90)

each having a stepped outer face, adjacent teeth defining
relatively wide (94) and narrow (96) castellations for receiving

wire inserter tools.
An insulation displacement connector according to Claim
3, wherein an outer face of each tooth has a recess (94)

extending along the length of the tooth at each side of the face,
the recesses of each tooth defining the relatively narrow

castellations therebetween.
An insulation displacement connector according to Claim
3 or 4, wherein the relatively wide castellations are provided on

a first side of the housing and the relatively narrow
castellations on an opposite side of the housing. 
An insulation displacement connector according to any
one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the insulation displacements

contacts are received in the housing at a substantially constant
pitch along an axis, the housing comprising end walls (82, 86)

having a stepped profile, the thickness of each end wall varying
along the wall to define a relatively thin portion (80, 84) on one

side of the axis and a relatively thick portion on the other side
of the axis.
An insulation displacement connector according to Claim
6, wherein the housing comprises a first and a second end wall

(82, 86), the profile of the first end wall being the inverse of
the profile of the second end wall, whereby two or more housings

are stackable end to end with a constant insulation displacement
contact pitch.
