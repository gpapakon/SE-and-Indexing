<ABSTRACT>
Method for the multiple receipt and discharge of rolled 
sections onto a cooling plate, the method being suitable to 

handle simultaneously groups of two or more rolled sections 
(11) arriving simultaneously from an intake channel, whereby 

at least one multigroove equipped channel (10) receives the 
sections (11) simultaneously and discharges them while 

another group of sections (11) arrives in separate distinct 
grooves, such discharge taking place in cooperation with 

specific acceptance seatings (19) on the cooling plate (18), 
the cooling plate (18) advancing in each forward movement 

cycle by a number of acceptance seatings (19) equal to "n" 
times the pitch ("i") of the cooling plate (18), the number 

"n" being a function of the number of rolled sections 
arriving at the same time.

 
Device to receive and discharge a multiple of rolled 

sections (11) onto a cooling plate (18) of the type 
disclosed in IT-83366 A/90, the device being suitable to 

handle groups of a plurality of rolled sections (11) at the 
same time and including a supporting bar (14) positioned 

above the cooling plate (18) and determining vertically a 
first guide groove (12a-12c) and a second guide groove (12b-12d) 

on each side, the guide grooves (12) being defined by 
panels (15) able to move perpendicularly to the supporting 

bar (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method for the multiple receipt 
and discharge of rolled sections onto a cooling plate and 
also the device performing such method, as set forth in the 
respective main claims. The invention is applied to the release step on a system, 
consisting advantageously of a cooling plate, for the 
removal of rolled sections arriving from a rolling line. The rolled sections in this invention are delivered 
axially into receiving channels and are then discharged 
therefrom by falling onto the cooling plate in cooperation 
with the cycle of forward movement of the cooling plate. The invention is applied advantageously in cooperation 
with methods for the simultaneous rolling of two or more 
sections according to the splitting process technique. The state of the art covers many embodiments of channels 
to receive a plurality of rolled sections at the same time. 
These channels cooperate at their upstream ends with 
switches which steer the arriving sections and deliver them 
into the relative receiving grooves. Drum-type channels are known and include a plurality of 
receiving channels positioned circumferentially like a drum. 
These drum-type channels entail various drawbacks linked to 
the possible deflection of the bar passing through, the 
great installed power, the twists produced in the channels, 
the complexity of construction and the maintenance involved. IT-83366 A/90 discloses channels including two or more 
guide grooves positioned substantially symmetrically in 
relation to a vertical plane, each groove being provided 
with movable panels.  These movable panels are located in cooperation with the 
lower part of the guide grooves of the channel and, by being 
displaced laterally, free the outlet of the channel and 
enable the section to fall onto the cooling surface. The working mechanism of the known receiving and discharge 
devices, while including channels with a plurality of guide 
grooves, is not suitable to accept at the same time a 
plurality of sections arriving from a rolling line working 
by the splitting process. The present applicants have set themselves the problem of 
providing a method to receive and discharge rolled sections 
onto a cooling plate by using suitably adapted receiving 
channels which make use of the same working principle as the 
channels described in the aforesaid IT-83366 A/90 and 
suitable to cooperate with multisection rolling systems. The applicants have set themselves in particular the 
problem of speeding up the cycle of receiving and 
dischar

<CLAIMS>
Method for the multiple receipt and discharge of rolled 
sections onto a cooling plate, the method being suitable to 

handle simultaneously groups of two or more rolled sections 
(11) arriving simultaneously from an intake channel, the 

method being characterised in that at least one multigroove 
equipped channel (10) receives the sections (11) 

simultaneously and discharges them while another group of 
sections (11) arrives in separate distinct grooves, such 

discharge taking place in cooperation with specific 
acceptance seatings (19) on the cooling plate (18), the 

cooling plate (18) advancing in each forward movement cycle 
by a number of acceptance seatings (19) equal to "n" times 

the pitch ("i") of the cooling plate (18), the number "n" 
being a function of the number of rolled sections arriving 

at the same time. 
Method as in Claim 1, whereby the single sections (11) 
of each group of sections (11) are delivered into the 

channel (10) in vertically arranged grooves.. 
Method as in Claim 1 or 2, whereby the single sections 
(11) of each group of sections (11) are delivered into the 

channel (10) in horizontally arranged grooves. 
Method as in any claim hereinbefore, whereby the number 
"n" equals 2. 
Method as in any claim hereinbefore, which includes at 
least two multigroove channels (10) positioned side by side, 

one of which (10a-10b) is suitable to receive a group of 
sections (11) leaving a multisection rolling line at the 

same time, while the other channel (10b-10a) discharges onto

seatings (19) equal to the number of sections (11) 

discharged, during normal running, from the other second
