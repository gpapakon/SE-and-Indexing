<ABSTRACT>
An electro-hydraulic control system in a 
power transmission has a neutral idle regulator valve 

(74) which controls the engagement pressure in a drive 
establishing device (76), a torque converter clutch 

control valve (46) for controlling the operating 
condition of a torque converter clutch (44), and a 

solenoid control valve (56) for controlling the 
distribution of a bias pressure. A shift valve (64) 

determines the distribution of the bias pressure to 
the neutral idle regulator valve, such that in a low 

forward ratio, the drive establishing device is 
controlled to a reduced torque capacity when certain 

vehicle parameters are present and to the torque 
converter clutch control valve when another forward 

ratio is established. The pressure level of the bias 
pressure is determined by an electronic control 

mechanism disposed within the vehicle. The engagement 
pressure of both the drive establishing device and the 

torque converter clutch is determined by the pressure 

output of the solenoid control valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a transmission 
control system for a transmission of a vehicle, and 
more particularly, to a transmission control system in 
a transmission having both a torque converter clutch 
and a neutral idle subsystem. Transmissions that include both a torque 
converter clutch and a neutral idle control provide 
separate and distinct controls for each subsystem. 
This results in an increase in the number of solenoid 
control valves and complexity in the electrical 
control module. The torque converter clutch pressure 
is generally controlled to prevent clutch engagement 
at low throttle conditions. In neutral idle control 
systems, wherein a pressure operated friction device 
is controlled in a disengaged or slipping state to 
limit torque transfer, the engagement pressure is 
reduced at low throttle conditions when the vehicle is 
at rest. As a general rule, the pressure control 
function of these subsystems is regulated by separate 
solenoid controlled valve mechanisms which will 
produce a variable signal pressure proportional to the 
voltage duty cycle imposed on the solenoid windings. 
Each subsystem has an assigned solenoid control valve 
mechanism to establish the engagement pressure 
therein. The electronic control or digital computer 
of the electrical control module is operable to 
provide the necessary signals to the solenoid 
controlled valve mechanisms to provide the output 
pressure schedule desired. A transmission control system in accordance 
with the present invention is characterised by the 
features specified in Claim 1.  The present invention uses a single solenoid 
controlled pressure regulator (preferably a variable 
bleed solenoid valve) to establish the control 
pressure function for both a torque converter clutch 
and a neutral idle regulator valve. The pressure 
output signal of the solenoid controlled pressure 
regulator is distributed by a shift valve which 
directs the pressure output signal to the neutral idle 
regulator valve in the low forward range and to the 
torque converter clutch in all other forward ranges. 
The solenoid controlled pressure regulator valve is 
controlled by an electronic control unit of the 
transmission to provide the desired output pressure 
for the valve mechanisms depending upon the operating 
state of the transmission. However, since the 
electronic or electrical output from the electronic 
control unit to the solenoid controlled pressure 
regulator is directed to a single valve mechanism, the 
control circuitry is somewhat
