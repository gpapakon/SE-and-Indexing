<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a biaxially stretched, transparent, tubular sausage casing coextruded in at least four layers, in particular for casing scalded-meat and cooked-meat sausage, whose high barrier action with respect to permeation by water vapour and oxygen and with respect to light transmission permits storage of the encased products over comparatively long periods without the encased products suffering visually recognisable damage.

Biaxially stretched, transparent, tubular sausage
casing, in particular for encasing sausage for

simmering and boiling, coextruded in at least 4
layers, which contains at least two layers

predominantly of aliphatic polyamide which form the
inner and outer surfaces of the tube, and at least two

further layers which are enclosed by the inner and
outer polyamide layers, wherein at least one of the

enclosed layers acts as a barrier to water vapour and
has a polyolefinic character, and at least one further

enclosed layer acts as a highly effective barrier to
oxygen and comprises predominantly ethylene-vinyl

alcohol copolymer, characterised in that at least one
layer of the composite film contains a quantity of up

to 3 wt.%, in relation to the total weight of the
casing, of powdered inorganic pigments having an

average particle size of between 0.01 and 5 µm, and at
least 
one layer of the composite film comprises
predominantly aliphatic polyamide and proportionately

a quantity of from 1 to 15 wt.% of partially aromatic
copolyamide, with the exception of composite films in

the case of which the sausage casing is seamless, the
layer enclosed by the inner and outer polyamide layers

which has the function of a barrier to water vapour is
constructed of polyethylene or polypropylene and/or

ethylene and/or propylene-based copolymers, the
inorganic pigments have a particle size of

approximately 1 µm, a further layer of predominantly
aliphatic polyamide is present which is modified by

the addition of from 5 to 50 wt.%, in relation to the
total weight of the polymer mixture, of (partially)

aromatic polyamide and is connected in direct manner 
to at least one of the inner and outer polyamide

layers.
Casing according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
aliphatic polyamide is a linear polyamide (PA) 6, PA

11, PA 12 and/or linear copolyamide PA 6.66, PA 6.8,
PA 6.9, PA 6.10, PA 6.11, PA 6.12 or a mixture of the

aforementioned aliphatic polyamides and copolyamides.
Casing according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
partially aromatic copolyamide comprises diamine

monomers and dicarboxylic acid monomers.
Casing according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that at least one of the

layers comprising predominantly aliphatic polyamide
contains from 70 to 95 wt.% of linear aliphatic

polyamide and/or linear aliphatic copolyamide and

partially aromatic copolyamide and/or
copolymer based on ethylene or propylene and
having functional end groups,

in proportions of at least 3 to a maximum of 30 wt.%,
in relation to the total weight of the polymer

mixture.
Casing according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the water vapour barrier

layer comprises predominantly ethylene monomers and/or
propylene monomers.
Casing according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the water vapour barrier 

layer contains typical primers based on ethylene
monomers and/or propylene monomers having functional

end groups.
Casing according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ethylene-vinyl

alcohol copolymer has an ethylene content of from 20
to 50 wt.%, and the degree of saponification of the

ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer starting material is
at least 85%.
Casing according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the ethylene-vinyl

alcohol copolymer contains as further components
propylene, butene-1, pentene-1 or methylpentene-1.
Casing according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the powdered inorganic

pigments are zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, iron oxide
and/or silicon dioxide.
Casing according to at least one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the sum of all the layer

thicknesses of the coextruded casing is from 35 to
70 µm, in particular from 40 to 65 µm.
