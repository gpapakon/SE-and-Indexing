<DESCRIPTION>
 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST THE α-TNF TYPE I RECEPTOR, PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION AND USE THEREOFThe invention relates to a class of monoclonal antibodies against an epitope of the α-TNF (α Tumour Necrosis Factor) type I receptor, defined as TNF-RI, that is present either in a membrane associated, insoluble form or in a soluble form; said antibodies show an antagonist activity. The epitope is located either in coincidence or in proximity of the receptor TNF binding site; therefore, antibodies against the same have affinity characteristics, suitable to be used in pharmacology as TNF antagonists, as well as for measurements of TNF-RI at low concentrations in analysis systems and finally, as TNF-RI purifying system.The TNF is a cytokine, that is mainly secreted by activated macrophages and was initially detected in serum of BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) infected mice, because of its ability of inducing an haemorrhagic necrosis of some tumours in experimental animal models.More recently, TNF was identified as one of the main inflammation mediators. Under special circumstances of acute and/or chronic production, TNF may cause pathologic conditions, such as septic shock, cerebral malarial fever, lipid dysmetabolism, known as cachexia, the last being typical in patients affected by some chronic and neoplastic infectious diseases. Further, it was found that TNF, together with other cytokines and lymphokines, is effective in immunoregulation, angiogenesis, cell differentiation and growth processes (Beutler, B. and Cera i, A., Ann.Rev. Immunol., 7, 625-655, 1989) .Many, if not all, of TNF induced effects are believed to be mediated by receptors on the membrane of 

 target cells. Two different receptors, named TNF-PI andTNF-RII, were recently purified and characterised(Smith, C.A. et al . , Science, 243, 1019-1023, 1990;Schall, T.J. et al., Cell, 61, 301-370, 1990) . The TNF cytotoxic activity is mainly mediated by TNF-RI.Moreover, soluble forms, corresponding to extracellular portion of both receptors and shoving a strong inhibiting action against TNF, were purified either from urine of healthy subjects or, in a larger extent, from urine of feverisn or affected by chronic renal failure patients, or from serum of neoplasia affected patients (Nophar, Y. et al . Embo J., 9, 3269-3278; .In some pathologic states, such as septic shock (Waage et al . , Lancet, l, 355, 1987), rejection of transplanted kidneys (Maury et al . , J. Exp. Med., 166, 1132, 1987), parasitic infections (Scuderi et al., Lancet, n, 1364,
