<ABSTRACT>
Metal sheet having less residual stress in its interior, a great tensile strength, a small inner resistance, and an excellent capability 
of supporting substances. In the metal sheet a number of holes (4) are made with punches (2) alternately in two directions 

and have rupture projections (5) in the punching directions. Such perforated metal sheet (6) can be manufactured preferably by 
passing metal sheet (3) between a pair of rotating rollers (1) which faces each other, are arranged rotatably in the directions opposite 

to each other, and have punches (2) on both cylindrical surfaces in such a way as to be interdigitated. The perforated metal 
sheet is particularly useful for the manufacture of the plates of a cell which support active material. The sheet is also useful for the 

manufacture of various supporters of substances such as in a preferably catalyst unit which supports a catalyst, and a preferable 
filtering unit which supports a filtering material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a perforated metal sheet 
having a small residual internal stress, a high tensile 
strength, a low internal resistance and a high power of 
holding a substance, a method of manufacturing the 
metal sheet, a supporter for a substance and a cell plate 
for a battery using the metal sheet. There is known a method which manufactures a 
perforated metal sheet by pressing a perforating sheet 
having a multiplicity of piercing punches against a sheet 
metal, such as of nickel, to make a multiplicity of holes 
at a time in it. This method has, however, the drawbacks 
of being likely to give a product having a large residual 
internal stress, and being unable to manufacture a long 
product continuously. There are also known a nonwoven fabric of nickel made 
in sheet form by bonding fine nickel fibers together, and 
nickel foam in the form of a foamed sheet of nickel. They 
are widely used for a cell plate in an alkaline battery. 
These nickel material have, however, the drawbacks of 
having a low tensile strength and a high internal 
resistance, and being incapable by contraction of proper 
welding to lead wires, etc. There are also known a metal sheet of lead or lead 
alloy having a grid pattern of holes formed by casting, and 
a metal sheet of lead or lead alloy having a grid pattern 
of holes formed by punching or expansion after slitting. 
They are used for a cell plate in a lead accumulators. 
They have, however, the drawbacks of having a high internal 
resistance, a small current-collecting capacity, a low  
 
tensile strength and a low power of holding an active 
material. It is, therefore, an abject of this invention to 
provide an improved perforated metal sheet having a small 
residual internal stress, a high tensile strength, a low 
internal resistance and a high power of holding a 
substance, a method of manufacturing the metal sheet, a 
supporter for a substance and a cell plate for a battery 
using the metal sheet. Other objects of this invention will appear in the 
following description and appended claims. According to the invention, there is provided a 
perforated metal sheet which comprises a sheet metal 
having a multiplicity of holes made with piercing punches 
alternately in opposite directions from both sides of said 
sheet metal, each of said holes having rupture projections 
around it in the piercing direction. The quality and 
thickness of the sheet metal, and the shape, size and 
density of the holes depend mainly on the purpose for which 
is used. The
