<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a device for scribing (inscribing) IC housings (IC1,... IC10) with the aid of a laser beam, simultaneous scribing of a plurality of IC housings (IC1,... IC5) with a plurality of scribing laser beams (B1,... B5) takes place, which beams are produced by a beam-splitter unit located between a laser-beam source (2) and an scribing head (6, 8). Using two parallel conveyor belts, asynchronous operation can be employed. While, for example, five IC housings are being scribed simultaneously on one belt, a forward shift takes place on the other belt to an extent corresponding to the length of one row of five IC housings. The scribing laser beams (B1,... B5) are subsequently directed onto the other conveyor belt with the IC housings (IC6, ... IC10) located thereon, while the conveyor belt with the counterparts just scribed is moved further.
