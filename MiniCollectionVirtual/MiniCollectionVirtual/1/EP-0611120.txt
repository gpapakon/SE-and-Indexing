<ABSTRACT>
A magnetooptical recording method for overwriting 
information on a magnetooptical recording medium, which 

has a first magnetic layer and a second magnetic layer 
having a larger coercive force and a lower Curie 

temperature than those of the first magnetic layer, 
comprises an initialization step of initializing 

magnetization of the first magnetic layer in one 
direction, a first type recording step of radiating a 

light beam by repeating radiation and non-radiation 
states of the laser beam, while applying a bias 

magnetic field after the initialization step, a second 
type recording step of continuously radiating a light 

beam while applying a bias magnetic field in a 
direction opposite to the one direction after the 

initialization step, and a step of selecting one of the 
first and second type recording steps in accordance 

with recording information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an overwrite
capable magnetooptical recording method.Conventionally, a magnetooptical memory is known
as an erasable optical memory. The magnetooptical
memory has merits such as high-density recording,
non-contact recording/reproduction, and the like as
compared to a magnetic recording medium using a
magnetic head. However, in order to record information
on such a magnetooptical memory, in general, an already
recorded portion must be erased (magnetized in one
direction) before recording.Thus, a method of independently arranging a
recording/reproduction head and an erasing head, a
method of performing recording while modulating a
magnetic field which is applied simultaneously with
radiation of a continuous laser beam, and the like have
been proposed. In the former recording method, the
apparatus becomes large in scale, resulting in high
cost. In the latter recording method, high-speed
modulation is disturbed when a large magnetic field is
applied. When a magnetic head is arranged near a
medium surface to achieve high-speed modulation, the 
rotating medium and the magnetic head contact each
other to cause a head crash, or the magnetic head is
easily influenced by dust attached to the medium
surface. As a result, the original merits of
magnetooptical recording may be lost.In order to solve these problems, a method for
realizing overwriting by the following two types of
recording methods using a two-layered perpendicular
magnetic film which comprises a magnetic layer having a
large coercive force and a low Curie temperature, and a
magnetic layer having a small coercive force and a high
Curie temperature has been proposed. In one recording
method, after the direction of magnetization of only
the layer having the small coercive force is aligned in
one direction by applying a relatively large magnetic
field, recording is performed by inverting the
direction of magnetization of the aligned layer by
applying large laser power. In the other recording
method, recording is performed by aligning the
direction of magnetization of the layer having the
large coercive force and the low Curie temperature to
the direction of magnetization of the layer having the
small coercive force by applying small laser power
without inverting the direction of magnetization of the
layer having the small coercive force and the high
Curie temperature. However, in this method, a
recording state wherein a magnetic wall is present 
between the two magnetic layers may pose a problem
associated with stability
