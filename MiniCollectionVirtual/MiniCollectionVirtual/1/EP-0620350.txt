<ABSTRACT>
According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention there are provided, in the region of a corner deflection 10 of the drive-rod system 16 of a sash/leaf frame, two engagement elements 26, 38 of which a first engagement element 26 serves to fix a tilted-slightly-open position of the sash/leaf frame and a second engagement element (38) serves to lock the sash/leaf frame. The two engagement elements 26, 38 engage respectively into first engagement means 32, 36 and second engagement means 44 of a fitting part 24 on the window/door frame. In this arrangement, the engagement means 44 is fitted on the fitting part 24 on the window/door frame such that it can be adjusted transversely with respect to the plane of the window/door frame.

order to be able selectively to adjust the fitting into the 

functional positions CLOSE-AND-LOCK (26d), TURN (26c), PART 
TILT (26b) and optionally TILT READINESS (26a), first 

engagement means (32, 36) associated with the PART TILT 
position and designed for a push rod-controlled engagement 

member (26) on the casement/leaf side and second engagement 
means (42) associated with the close-and-lock state (34d) are 

provided on one and the same frame-side fitting portion (24), 
characterised by a combination of the following features:
 
that 


a) the second engagement means (42) are arranged on 
the fitting portion (24) so as to be adjustable in 

a direction corresponding to a direction (N) normal 
to the frame plane and 
b) an additional push rod-controlled engagement member 
(38) is provided on the casement or leaf side for 

closing and locking. 
A fitting according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the first engagement member (26) is movable by means of a 

first push rod member (16a, 10a1) and the second (additional) 
engagement member (38) is movable by means of a second push 

rod member (16b, 10a2) extending substantially orthogonally 
to the first. 
A fitting according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the first engagement member (26) is formed of an engagement  

 
unit (26), which projects from the first push rod member 

(16a, 10a1) in a substantially orthogonal direction. 
A fitting according to claim 2 or claim 3, 
characterised in that the second engagement member (38) is 

arranged as an extension of the second push rod member (16b, 
10a2). 
A fitting according to any one of claims 2 to 4, 
characterised in that the first (26) and second (38) 

engagement members (26, 28) are arranged on push rod portions 
(10a1, 10a2) of a corner deflector (10). 
A fitting according to any one of claims 2 to 5, 
characterised in that the first (16a, 10a1) and the second 

(16b, 10a2) push rod members are associated with an upper 
corner of the casement or leaf remote from the axis of 

rotation. 
A fitting according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the frame-side fitting portion (24) is associated with an 

upper frame leg (60). 
A fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the frame-side fitting portion (24) is 

freely movable in the direction of movement of a first push 
rod member (16a, 10a1) and adjustable by adjusting faces (50, 

52), which are arranged on the one hand on the fitting 
portion (24) and on the other hand in fixed association with 

the range of movement (48a-48d) of the first engagement 
member (26), in such a way that they enter into engagement 

when the casement/leaf approaches a CLOSE position relative 
to the frame and bringing the fitting portion (24) into a 

desired position. 
A fitting according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the adjusting face (52) fixedly associated with the range of  

 
movement (48a-48d) of the first engagement member (26) is 

arranged on a slip rail portion (10d), especially a slip rail 
portion of a corner deflection part (10). 
A fitting according to claim 8 or claim 9, 
characterised in that the adjusting faces (50, 52) are formed 

of a pair consisting of an adjusting funnel (50) and an 
adjusting strip (52). 
A fitting according to claim 10, characterised in 
that the adjusting funnel (50) is attached to the frame-side 

fitting portion (24) and the adjusting strip (52) is fixedly 
associated with the range of movement (48a-48d) of the first 

engagement member (26). 
A fitting according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that the second engagement means (42) are 

formed of a rotary member (42), which is mounted in the
