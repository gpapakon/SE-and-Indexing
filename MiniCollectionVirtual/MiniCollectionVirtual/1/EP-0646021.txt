<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates the use of continuous 
deionization as an alternative or substitute method for 
purification of a crude contrast agent, and more 
particularly, to an improved method of purifying Ioversol 
by removing acids and other impurities present in the crude 
form thereof. Ioversol is disclosed as a useful nonionic X-ray 
contrast agent in U.S. Patent No. 4,396,598, incorporated 
herein by reference. N,N'-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-5-[N(2-hydroxyethyl) 
glycolamido] -2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamide, 
more commonly called Ioversol has the following structure: 
 
In the production of Ioversol, purification columns are 
used to remove impurities from the crude Ioversol product 
following completion of the synthetic steps as described in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,396,598. Approximately 11 per cent of 
the crude Ioversol produced is lost from the time it enters 
the purification plant to the final purification of the 
product. Besides this large loss of Ioversol during 
purification, the cost and time involved in the 
purification operations, such as regenerating and replacing  
 
the purification columns is significant. Large amounts of 
costly resins and large volumes of solutions are also 
necessary to regenerate the purification columns between 
uses. These costs are significant in the production of 
Ioversol. In Tangents, Issue 6, pages 1 to 6 (June 1991) it 
is disclosed that continuous deionization can be used to 
reduce salt concentrations by over 99% in contrast agents 
having molecular weights of 600 to 1550 daltons and to 
remove 200 to 300 dalton impurities that are often present 
and cannot be removed by reverse osmosis. An improved procedure which eliminates the need for 
costly purification columns to remove impurities from the 
crude Ioversol product following synthesis thereof is 
desired as an alternate and/or a more cost efficient method 
of producing Ioversol. It is, therefore, an object of the 
present invention to meet these needs. Additional objects and features of the present 
invention will appear from the following description in 
which the preferred methods are set forth in detail in 
conjunction with the accompanying drawing. Figure 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of a 
continuous deionization system. According to the present invention there is 
provided a method for the purification of a crude material 
selected from crude Ioversol, a crude neutrally charged 
magnetic resonance imaging agent, a 5-amino-N,N'-bis-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-2,4,6-triiodoisopthalamide 
product
