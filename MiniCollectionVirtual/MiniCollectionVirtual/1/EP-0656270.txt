<ABSTRACT>
A wheel suspension for an axle of a motor vehicle, especially a McPherson front axle (1), has a control arm (2) and an articulated tension strut (3), the control arm (2) being held on the wheel carrier (6) by way of a joint (7) and the body-side bearings (9, 13) of the control arm (2) and the tension strut (3) and the connecting bearing (10) between control arm (2) and tension strut (3) being designed with a defined characteristic for the elastokinematic adjustment of the wheel under the action of circumferential forces acting on the wheel. The control arm (2) with the connected tension strut (3) is arranged in an approximately horizontal plane and extends below the wheel axis of rotation (R) approximately in a wheel centre transverse plane. The tension strut (3) is articulated on the control arm (2) by way of a connecting bearing (10) and runs slanting at an angle to a longitudinal centre axis of the vehicle. The control arm (8) is arranged at both a vertical and longitudinal interval from a track rod (4) of a steering gear arranged below the wheel axis of rotation (R) and - in relation to the direction of travel (F) - in front of the control arm (2).
