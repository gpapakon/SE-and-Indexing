<ABSTRACT>
A scanning type exposure apparatus includes a mask 
stage (10) which can move a mask (12) in a predetermined scanning 

direction (y); a substrate stage (2) which can move a 
substrate (5), onto which a pattern on the mask is to be 

transferred, in the predetermined scanning direction; a 
fine movement stage (11) which is arranged on one of the 

mask stage and the substrate stage, and is movable in 
the scanning direction relative to the one stage; a 

first measuring device (14) for detecting the position, in 
the scanning direction, of the fine movement stage; a 

second measuring device (13) for detecting the position, in 
the scanning direction, of the other one of the mask 

stage and the substrate stage; a speed controller for 
controlling the ratio between the speeds of the mask 

stage and the substrate stage to a predetermined value 
while the pattern on the mask is scanning-exposed on 

the substrate; and a control device for controlling the 
position of the fine movement stage in correspondence 

with the difference between the position measured by 
the first measuring device and the position measured by 

the second measuring device during the scanning 
exposure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exposure
apparatus used in a photolithography process in the
manufacture of, e.g., a semiconductor element, a liquid
crystal display element, a thin-film magnetic head, or
the like and, more particularly, to a scanning type
exposure apparatus for transferring a pattern on a mask
(or a reticle) onto a substrate by synchronously moving
the mask and the substrate.The Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 6-140305, filed on October 26, 1992
and published on May 20, 1994, refers to a scanning type exposure apparatus.
According to the disclosure in this application, constant speed drive of a reticle and a
wafer in a relative scanning direction and positioning of the reticle and the wafer are
simultaneously performed with a high precision by a slit scanning exposure scheme.
A reticle side scanning stage for scanning a reticle relative to a slit-like illumination
area in the relative scanning direction is placed on a reticle side base. A reticle side
fine adjustment stage for moving and rotating the reticle within a two-dimensional
ptane is placed on the reticle side scanning stage. The reticle is placed on the reticle
side fine adjustment stage. Constant speed drive and positioning of the reticle and a
wafer are performed by independently controlling the reticle side scanning stage and
the reticle side fine adjustment stage.EP-A-0 360 272 discloses a
stepper for circuit pattern
formation. In the photolithography process in the manufacture
of semiconductor elements, a projection exposure
apparatus for transferring a pattern formed on a mask
or reticle (to be generally referred to as a "reticle"
hereinafter) onto a substrate (wafer) coated with a
photosensitive material (photoresist) via a projection
optical system, in particular, a step-and-repeat type
reduction production exposure apparatus (stepper), is
popularly used. Recently, in correspondence with an
increase in size and a decrease in line width of
semiconductor elements, it is required to widen the
image field of the projection optical system and to
improve the resolution of the projection optical
system. However, it is very difficult in terms of 
design and manufacture to realize both the high
resolution and the wide field of the projection optical
system. Thus, as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Patent
Nos. 4,747,678, 4,924,257, 5,194,893, and 5,281,996, a
scanning type exposure apparatus, which illuminates
only a partial area having a predetermined shape (e.g.,
a rectangular shape, arcuated shape, hexagonal shape,
rhomb
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A scanning type exposure apparatus comprising:

an illumination system for ilfuminating a partial area on a mask with light, 
a mask stage which is moveable in a predetermined scanning direction while
holding the mask, and
a substrate stage which is moveable in the predetermined scanning direction
while holding a substrate onto which a pattern on the mask is to be transferred;

wherein each of the mask stage and the substrate stage comprises a fine
movement stage which is moveable relative to the mask stage and substrate

stage, respectively;

a first measuring device for measuring the position, in the predetermined scanning
direction, of the fine movement stage for the mask stage,

a second measuring device for measuring the position, in the predetermined
scanning direction, of the fine movement stage for the substrate stage,

a device for controlling the position of each fine movement stage by a feedback
method in correspondence with a difference between the position measured by

the first measuring device and the position measured by the second measuring
device during the scanning exposure.
A scanning type exposure apparatus according to claim 1,
wherein the first and second measuring device comprises an interferometer

system.
A scanning type exposure apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
wherein the substrate stage moves in a direction opposite to the movement of the

mask stage.
