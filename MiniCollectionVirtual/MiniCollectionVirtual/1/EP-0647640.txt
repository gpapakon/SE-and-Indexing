<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the
preparation of pilocarpine derivatives from a 5-formylimidazole
derivative of the formula II.

in which
R1 is hydrogen, alkyl having 1 - 8 C atoms, or a
carbocyclic radical.Of particular interest is the derivative where R1
= methyl, which is a precursor of pilocarpine and can be
converted into this in a known manner.Pilocarpine, an imidazole alkaloid, is the
subject of numerous investigations on account of its
varied pharmacological properties. Its outstanding
pharmacological actions are diaphoretic effects,
stimulation of the parasympathetic system, miotic actions
and in particular applications in ophthalmology.Processes for the preparation of racemic and
optically active pilocarpine are known. All these processes
are characterized, however, by a comparably large
number of synthesis steps, only low overall yields being
achieved.In the synthesis of H. Link and K. Bernauer
(Helv. Chem. Acta 55, 1053 (1972)), racemic pilosinine is
used as a precursor of pilocarpine. The starting material
employed was 5-formyl-1-methylimidazole, which is easily
accessible from sarcosine in a few steps. The process of
Link and Bernauer comprises the Stobbe condensation of an
imidazole derivative with succinic acid diester to give
a monomaleate whose regioselective reduction leads to
butenolide formation, from which pilosinine is produced
by catalytic reduction in the last step. The disadvantage
of this process is the poor course of the Stobbe condensation, 
where yields of at most 20% are achieved.In U.S. 5,180,837 a process for the preparation
of racemic pilosinine derivatives from 5-formyl-1-methylimidazole
is described. By conversion of the
imidazole derivative to a thioacetal, deprotonation
thereof and Michael addition to γ-crotonolactone and
final desulfurization, the pilosinine derivative is
accessible as a pilocarpine precursor. The disadvantage
of the process described there is the low overall vield.JP-A-49116296 discloses a method for producing imidazole acetol by fermentation.The object of the present invention is to find a
process for the preparation of pilocarpine derivatives
from easily accessible starting materials, which proceeds
in high yields and largely without by-products.This object was surprisingly achieved by the
process according to the invention by means of a double
olefination reaction and subsequent hydrogenation.The invention therefore relates to a process for
the preparation of pilocarpine derivatives of the formula
I, which is characterized in that
