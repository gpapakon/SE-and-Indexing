<ABSTRACT>
A pourable aqueous composition for use as, or for dilution to form, a 
drilling mud comprises a least 2% by weight of a water soluble polyvalent 

metal salt of an alkyl polyoxyalkylene sulphuric or carboxylic acid, and 
at least 1% by weight of a corresponding salt of an alkyl benzene 

sulphuric acid, preferably in the presence of a water soluble inorganic 
salt or base of said polyvalent metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to aqueous based surfactant compositions
which are, or which are capable of forming, structured surfactant
systems, said compositions being especially useful as functional fluids
e.g. in drilling operations such as oil field drilling. The present
invention especially provides aqueous based surfactant compositions which
comprise soluble weighting agents.Structured surfactant systems have been developed in the detergent art for
their ability to suspend solid builders or abrasives, said builders or
abrasives typically being present in laundry detergents or hard surface
cleaners respectively.A structured surfactant system is a pourable composition which has the
ability to suspend solid particles indefinitely, by virtue of the
rheological properties of surfactant mesophases present in the surfactant
system.Structured surfactant systems normally comprise spherulites of surfactant
and water in which the former is arranged in a plurality of concentric
shells each formed from a bilayer of surfactant molecules.
The spherulites are dispersed in a continuous aqueous medium and are
packed together to confer on the composition a yield point sufficient to
resist any tendency to sedimentation or buoyancy of any solid particles
dispersed in the composition, such as to maintain said particles
indefinitely in suspension. However the shear stresses created by
pouring or stirring the composition exceed the yield point and suffice to
break the structure enabling the composition to be poured, pumped and
stirred like a normal liquid. Other surfactant mesophases, whether alone or interspersed with aqueous
phase can provide similar rheological properties, for example "G" phase
which is liquid crystal Lamellar Phase, of the type also known in the
literature as "neat" phase or "lamellar" phase.Structured surfactant systems are described in GB 2 123 846 and GB 2 153
380 and their use in functional fluids is described in EP-A-0430602."Functional fluids" is a term commonly used to embrace lubricants,
including drilling and cutting fluids, hydraulic fluids and heat transfer
fluids. "Drilling Fluid" is used herein to refer to fluids used in the
drilling of bore holes in rock to lubricate and cool drill bits, and to
transport rock cuttings away from the rock face. The term is also used
herein to include "Spacer Fluids", which are used to clean the sides of
bore holes prior to cementing. Drilling Fluids are used in the
construction of deep wells and bore holes, and especially oil and gas
wells. For
