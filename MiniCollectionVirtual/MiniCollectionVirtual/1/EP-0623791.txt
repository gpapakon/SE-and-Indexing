<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating a refrigeration unit when 
a condition is detected which may result in shutdown of 

the unit, with the refrigeration unit having a 
refrigerant compressor driven at low and high speeds by 

an internal combustion engine, with the engine including 
an oil pressure sensor, comprising the steps of 

monitoring the oil pressure of the engine, detecting a 
predetermined low oil pressure condition, switching the 

engine to high speed when it is in low speed at the time 
the detecting step detects the predetermined low oil 

pressure condition, determining if the engine oil 
pressure has increased above a predetermined value after 

the step of switching to high speed, continuing to 
operate the engine at high speed when the determining 

step finds the engine oil pressure has increased above 
the predetermined value, and shutting the engine down 

when the determining step finds the engine oil pressure 
did not increase above the predetermined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to transport 
refrigeration units, and more specifically to transport 
refrigeration units which have microprocessor based 
electrical control. The subject of this application has been 
divided from co-pending application no. 92306281.4. (EP-A-0 522 847). U.S. Patent 4,663,725 discloses the use of 
microprocessor based transport refrigeration control for 
use with a refrigerated container, with the refrigerant 
compressor being driven by an electric motor. This 
patent is directed primarily to the use of a 
microprocessor to operate the various components of the 
refrigeration system according to predetermined 
algorithms, and to detect and record faults which occur 
during the operation thereof. U.S. Patent 4,918,932 discloses the use of a 
microprocessor to determine average error between an 
operator selected set point temperature and the  
 
temperature of a space to be conditioned, using the 
outputs of return air and discharge air sensors. The 
average error is then used in the determination of an 
error signal which modulates the capacity of the system. The invention consists in a method of operating 
a refrigeration unit having a refrigerant compressor driven 
at low and high speeds by an internal combustion engine, 
with the engine including an oil pressure sensor, 
comprising the steps of: 
monitoring the oil pressure of the engine, 
detecting a predetermined low oil pressure condition, switching the engine to high speed when it is 
in low speed at the time the detecting step detects the 
predetermined low oil pressure condition, determining if the engine oil pressure has 
increased above a predetermined value after the step of 
switching to high speed, continuing to operate the engine at high speed 
when the determining step finds the engine oil pressure 
has increased above the predetermined value, and shutting 
the engine down when the determining step finds the 
engine oil pressure did not increase above the 
predetermined value. The invention will become more readily apparent by 
reading the following detailed description in conjunction  
 
with the drawings, which are shown by way of example only, 
wherein: 
Figure 1 is a partially block and partially 
schematic diagram of a transport refrigeration system 
having a refrigerant compressor driven by an internal 
combustion engine, which may utilize the methods of the 
invention; Figures 2A and 2B may be assembled to provide an 
electrical schematic diagram of microprocessor based 
electrical control shown
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a refrigeration unit 
(20) having 

a refrigerant compressor (26) driven at low and high 
speeds by an internal combustion engine (30), with the 

engine including an oil pressure sensor (114), comprising 
the steps of: 


monitoring (114) the oil pressure of the 
engine, detecting (314) a predetermined low oil pressure 

condition, 
switching (316) the engine to high speed when 
it is in low speed (310) at the time the detecting step 

detects the predetermined low oil pressure condition, 
determining (324) if the engine oil pressure 
has increased above a predetermined value after the step 

of switching to high speed, 
continuing (326) to operate the engine at high 
speed when the determining step finds the engine oil 

pressure has increased above the predetermined value, and 
shutting (312) the engine down when the determining step 

finds the engine oil pressure did not increase above the 
predetermined value. 
The method of claim 1 including the step of 
providing time (318, 320, 322) after the step of 

switching the engine to high speed, before initiating the  
 

step of determining (324) if the engine oil pressure 
increased above the predetermined value. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the engine has 
an oil level sensor (112), and including the steps of 

monitoring (112) the level of the engine oil, and detecting 
(314) when the oil level is below a predetermined 

level, with the step of switching (316) the engine to 
high speed taking place only when the oil level of the 

engine is at or above the predetermined level.
