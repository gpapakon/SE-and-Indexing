<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a device for a vacuum cleaner 
having a suction nozzle and a dust bag (12) which is 

connected to the nozzle for instance by means of a tube 
connection, a turbo fan unit (27) driven by an electric motor 

and placed after the dust bag seen in the flow direction. The 
impeller (29) of the turbo fan unit is driven at a speed 

which is above 50.000 rpm the primary air flow created by the 
turbo fan unit (27) being arranged to directly or indirectly 

leave the unit via an outlet (30) to atmosphere. The vacuum 
cleaner is provided with means (45) by means of which a 

secondary air flow is created which at least partly cools the 
electric motor (32) and which flows into the electric motor 

via one or several inlets (44) for cooling air which are 
separated from the primary air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vacuum cleaner.
Vacuum cleaners having a fan unit driven by an electric motor
and placed after the dust bag as seen in the air flow
direction, are previously known, see for instance US-A-2272985.
According to this arrangement the primary air flow
created by the fan unit is arranged to directly or indirectly
leave the unit via an outlet to atmosphere. There is also
provided first means creating a secondary air flow which at
least partly cools the electric motor and which flows into
the electric motor via one or several inlets which are
separated from the primary air flow.Vacuum cleaners operating with high speed electric
motors are described in WO-A-94/15518 and WO-A-94/15519 and mainly
have the advantage that they because of the small dimensions
of the vacuum source (turbo fan unit), can be manufactured as
small hand held appliances which are easy to handle and to
store at the same time, as the suction power is on the same
level as previously known traditional vacuum cleaners i.e.
such having a power demand of 500 - 1.500 W.Normally, to cool electric motors in conventional
vacuum cleaners, see for instance US-A-2531342 or FR-A-811248,
the air flow, which is created by the fan and which
is used for sucking up particles through the nozzle, is also 
used to cool the motor. When the particles have been
separated from the air in the dust bag and the air has flown
through the fan, the air or a part of the air passes outside
and through the electric motor before it is exhausted to
atmosphere. This method for cooling the electric motor is
simple but can not be used in connection with the vacuum
cleaners described in the two WO-publications mentioned above
since the air which reaches the motor despite the separation
of the particles is contaminated and can cause damages of the
motor. It is also desirable to use these fast running
electric motors for so called wet and dry suction cleaners
i.e. such cleaners where the water or cleaning liquids are
taken up by the nozzle together with the contaminates, the
moisty air flow, if beeing allowed to pass through the motor,
in a very short time would damage it. It is further a risk
that larger particles or details follow the air flow into the
motor if for any reason the dust bag would break and that
these particles because of the small dimensions of the motor
and the narrow passages in the motor would damage it.The purpose of this invention is to achieve a device
which gives a reliable cooling of the electric motor for a
turbo fan unit

<CLAIMS>
Vacuum cleaner device wherein the device is provided
with a suction nozzle (14) and a dust bag connected to the

nozzle for instance by means of a tube connection (13); a
turbo fan arrangement (11) comprising a turbo fan unit (27)

driven by an electric motor (32) and placed after the dust bag (12),
seen in the air flow direction, the primary air flow created

by the turbo fan unit (27) being arranged to directly or indirectly
leave the unit via an outlet (39) to atmosphere; first means

(45,47,29,52) creating a secondary air flow which at least
partly cools the electric motor (32) and which flows into the

electric motor (32) via one or several inlets (43) which are
separated from the primary air flow, the impeller (29) of the

fan unit being driven at a speed which is above 50.000 rpm;
second means in the form of openings (46,48,51,53) and/or a

deflector plate (54) for directing at least a part of the
secondary air flow from the first means (45,47,29,52) into

the primary air flow.
Device according to claim 1 wherein said first means
comprises a fan (45) for cooling air which is placed at the

same side of the electric motor (32) as the turbo fan unit
(27), the fan preferably being of the radial type.
Device according to claim 2 wherein the fan (45) for
cooling air and the turbo fan impeller (29) are an integrated

unit.
Device according to any of the preceding claims wherein
the electric motor is provided with hub parts (41) which

support bearings for an electric motor shaft (31), the
cooling air inlets (43) to the electric motor being arranged

outlets (42) from the electric motor are arranged close to

the other hub part.
Device according to claim 2 wherein the cooling air fan
is formed by the mainly flat rear side of the turbo fan

impeller (29). 
Device according to any of the preceding claims wherein
it comprises a passage (37) which is so arranged that the

primary air flows around the shell (35) of the electric motor
(32) whereas the cooling air flow is arranged to counterflow
