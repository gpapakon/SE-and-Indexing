<ABSTRACT>
An optical head device for use in a disc player 
comprises a movable optical assembly (23; 71; 71′) in which 

an objective lens (11), first and second mirrors (44; 44′, 
45) and a light beam generating and detecting unit (43) are 

supported in common by a supporting member (22; 81; 81′), 
and a driving mechanism (20,21a,21b,24; 72,74) for moving 

the movable optical assembly (23; 71; 71′) in both a first 
direction along an optical axis of the objective lens (11) 

and a second direction perpendicular to the first direction, 
wherein, in the movable optical assembly (23; 71; 71′), a 

light beam generated in the light beam generating and 
detecting unit (43) is reflected twice by the first and 

second mirrors (44; 44′, 45) to be changed in its traveling 
direction, and focused by the objective lens (11) at a 

position on the optical axis of the objective lens (11), and 
a light beam coming from the outside of the movable optical 

assembly (23; 71; 71′) is received by the objective lens 
(11) to pass therethrough to the second mirror (45), 

reflected twice by the second and first mirrors (44; 44′, 
45) to be changed in its traveling direction, and guided to 

a photodetector (51,52) contained in the light beam 
generating and detecting unit (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a disc player optical 
head device, and more particularly, 
to an optical head device which causes a light beam to 
impinge upon an optical record disc and guides the light 
beam from the optical record disc to a photodetector for 
reproducing information recorded on the optical record disc 
and is further operative to maintain the light beam incident 
upon the optical record disc in correct tracking and focus 
relations to a record track formed on the optical record 
disc. In an optical disc player for reproducing 
information recorded on an optical record disc, an optical 
head device is provided for constituting an optical 
arrangement to read information from a record track formed 
on the optical record disc by the use of a laser light beam 
impinging upon the record track. The optical head device is 
required to produce the laser light beam, cause the laser 
light beam to impinge upon the record track, which is  
 
usually very narrow in width, so as to track the same, and 
guide properly a reflected laser light beam obtained from 
the optical record disc to a photodetector. Further, the 
optical head device is also required to maintain the laser 
light beam incident upon the optical record disc in correct 
focus and tracking relation to the record track on the 
optical record disc. US-A-3882317 discloses an apparatus for reading a 
rotating disc-shaped record carrier containing signals 
coded in optical form. The apparatus includes a source of 
radiation and a first mirror. A beam of radiation emitted 
by the source and following a U-shaped path impinges on the 
first mirror which reflects the beam to the record carrier. 
A beam-splitting element and a second mirror are disposed 
at the bends of the U-shape, while behind the half-silvered 
mirror is arranged a detector unit which receives a 
radiation beam reflected at the record carrier. The U-shaped 
configuration lies in a plane which extends parallel 
to the plane of rotation of the record carrier, the opening 
of the U facing the interior of the apparatus. The U-shape 
is intended to reduce the bulk of the apparatus in the 
radial direction, relative to prior apparatuses in which 
the source of radiation, half-silvered mirror and pivotable 
mirror were arranged in a straight line parallel to the 
record carrier. For fulfilling the requirements set out in the second 
paragraph above, optical head devices can comprise a 
precise arrangement of various optical components including 
a semiconductor laser
