<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an espagnolette lock with at least one espagnolette-connecting slide (5, 6) which can be brought into positive hook connection with an espagnolette (1, 2) and which can be actuated by a lock mechanism, and with a locking element (7) which has a cross-sectional shape differing from the rectangular shape and which has full thickness in the middle region only, and in which, with the espagnolettes reclosed, a profiled longitudinal portion (9) cooperates with a hook connection. In order to develop a lock of this type having a reversible latch head, in such a way that, whilst maintaining approximately aligned locking edges according to DIN 18 251, a bolt arrangement essentially symmetrical in the cover-rail plane can be achieved, provision is made for the end region of the espagnolette (2) to form fingers (12, 13) and to overlap with a longitudinal portion (9) of thinner cross-section of the locking element designed as a bolt (7).

Driving rod lock with at least one lock mechanism-operated 
driving rod connecting slide (5, 6) which can be 

hooked in form-locking relationship to a driving rod (1, 
2), and with a locking element (7) of cross-sectional shape 

differing from the rectangular shape which has the full 
thickness only in the central region, and in which when the 

driving rods are retracted a profiled longitudinal section 
(9) cooperates with a hook connection, characterised in 

that the end region of the driving rod (2) forms fingers 
(12, 13) and overlaps a longitudinal section (9) of thinner 

cross-section of the locking element constructed as a bolt 
(7). 
Driving rod lock according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the central section (8) of thicker cross-section of 

the bolt (7) runs in a recess (10) of the broad face of the 
driving rod connecting slide (6). 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the bolt (7) which 

has in particular a cross-sectional shape symmetrical to 
the cuff plate plane is defined on either side of a central 

section (8) of thicker cross-section by a longitudinal 
section of thinner cross-section (9, 11). 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the driving rod end 

region encompasses the bolt (7) with both fingers (12, 13) 
in claw fashion. 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the driving rod end  

 
region lies with one of its two fingers (12, 13) in a 

recess (14) of the driving rod connecting slide (6). 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the end region of a 

second driving rod (1) comprises a keyhole-shaped recess 
(15) in which a projection (16) of the driving rod 

connecting slide (5) engages in form-locking relationship, 
the recess (15) being closed all round. 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the end region (17) 

of the second driving rod (1) in the retracted driving rod 
position (Figure 7) enters a groove (18) of the catch head 

(19). 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the catch head (19) 

is connected interchangeably to the catch tail (20). 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the catch head (19) 

can be offset in the direction of the bolt (7). 
Driving rod lock according to one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the catch tail (20) 

forms a fixing arm (21) of gusset-like construction for 
reversible and longitudinally slidable fixing of the catch 

head (19).
