opposite side faces of the steel strip (S) by a pair of 
rotary brushes (110a) which engage with said opposite side 

faces in a widthwise direction, rotary axes (111) of said 
rotary brushes (110a) of said devices (1) opposed in the 

widthwise direction of the steel strip (S) being inclined 
in the same direction relative to the traveling direction 

of the steel strip (S), one rotary brush (110a) on a side face 
of the steel strip (S) being set to rotate downwardly thereon 

and the other adjacent rotary brush (110a) on the same side 
as the one brush being set to rotate upwardly thereon in 

the case of providing more than two pairs of said side 
face polishing devices (1); a pressure roll (2) disposed on 

a lower or upper edge face of the steel strip (S) when said 
rotary brush (110a) polishes the side face of the steel strip 

(S) downwardly or upwardly; a detector (130) for detecting 
a change of a driving load in a motor (120) which drives 

said rotary brush (110a); and a controller (140) for adjusting 
a position of said rotary brush (110a) by applying a control 

signal to motor (150,161) which move said rotary brush (110a)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polishing system
for longitudinal opposite edge faces of a plated steel
strip.In the continuous electroplating of the steel
strip, a problem arises whereby when a plating electric
current is concentrated at opposite edge faces of the
steel strip, and consequently a so-called edge-over-coating
phenomenon takes place, it results in a plating
material being excessively deposited on ends of the steel
strip. Since the plated coating which has been deposited
excessively on opposite edge faces of the steel strip
by the concentrated electric current is in the state of
dendrite, and thus it is fragile and easily peeled off,
dents will be created on the steel strip by fragments
which will be peeled off during press forming operation
etc. The edge faces as used herein include longitudinal
side faces, upper and lower edge faces along a longitudinal
direction on the steel strip.The present applicant has previously proposed
a solution in the Japanese Examined Patent Publication
No. Hei 5-41385 entitled as "Polishing System for Opposite
Side Faces of the Plated Steel Strip". This document forms
the base for the preamble of claim 1.The prior art system and its relevant problem will
be described hereinbelow, with reference to accompanying
drawings for convenience of illustration, wherein;
FIG. 28 is a schematic side view of the prior art
polishing system;FIGS. 29A and 29B are pictorial views showing the
edge face of the steel strip which has been warped;FIGS. 30A - 30C are pictorial views illustrating
the prior art polishing system while it is being operated
to polish the side face of the steel strip; FIG. 31 is a plan view showing a positional
relationship between the conventional cylindrical rotary
brush and the steel strip while they are in contact each
other;FIG. 32 is a side view showing a surface where
the rotary brush and the side face of the steel strip in
FIG. 31 contact each other; andFIG. 33 is a front elevation showing a prior art
cleaning water spray unit.As shown in FIG. 28, the system as disclosed in
the above-described patent publication is designed to
remove a plated coating which has been adhered to opposite
side surfaces on the steel strip S which has been plated
on its dual surfaces, wherein the system comprises at least
a pair of side face polishing devices 1 each being arranged
along a traveling direction of the steel strip and being
adapted to polish opposite side faces of the steel strip S
by causing rotary brushes 110 to engage such opposite side
faces of the
