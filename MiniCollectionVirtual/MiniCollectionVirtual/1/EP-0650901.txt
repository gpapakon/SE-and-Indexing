<ABSTRACT>
A safety screw cap indicates prior opening of a container (3) to 
protect consumers from prior contamination. The screw cap (1) has an 

annular band (2) encircling its lower end which is separated from the 
screw cap by a perforated line (7). The band is affixed to a fixing 

element (4) and the fixing element attached to the container (3) when the 
screw cap is screwed in place. An unattached leader portion of the 

band (5) can be lifted easily to peel the band from the container. As the 
band is peeled from the container, it is simultaneously torn from the 

screw cap at the perforations. Once the band is removed, the screw 
cap can be unscrewed and the container unsealed. Before peeling 

the band away, the screw cap cannot be unscrewed without causing 
obvious damage to the screw cap or band. In addition, the torque 

required to shear-separate the band from the fixing element, the 
fixing element from the container or the screw cap from the band is 

greater than that which can be applied easily by a normal adult.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to screw top containers 
and specifically to such devices which reveal a prior opening by 
an alteration in their appearance when they are opened. It is relatively easy to open and reseal a screw-cap container. 
This presents a potential hazard to purchasers because such 
containers can be opened and resealed by someone other than the 
purchaser. Thus, container contents may be exposed and 
contaminated without the purchaser being aware of it. To eliminate 
the danger of such unapparent prior contamination of container 
contents, various devices have been implemented which permit a 
consumer to verify that a container has not been opened before the 
consumer purchases the product. One example is a screw cap that has a band with inward 
projections at the opening of the cap. When the cap is screwed onto 
a container, the projections on the band engage a protrusion on the 
container. The band breaks away from the cap at a perforated line 
when the cap is screwed off. Once opened, the cap and band cannot 
be restored to their original condition. However, the broken band 
only indicates a removal of the cap. Since it is necessary for the cap 
to lifted away from the bottle to break the cap from the band at the 
perforated line, any vacuum inside the container may be broken 
before the band breaks away. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to 
determine, upon quick inspection, if the vacuum has been broken 
without removing the cap. Since contaminants can enter once the 
vacuum breaks, this type of container sealing mechanism can provide  
 
no assurance that container contents are free of exposure to 
contaminants. Another problem with the above device is that it may be 
unsuitable for a large-mouth container. If the above device were 
applied to large-mouth container, the band portion would need to be 
unduly large and sturdy. The band must be sturdy to transmit torque 
applied to the cap via the projection on the band to the protrusion 
on the cap. Therefore, an excessive force would then be required to 
break the connection between the band and the cap and thereby 
open the container. Thus, this type of cap is unsuitable for a large-mouth 
container. Another type of tamper-revealing cap has an extended band 
portion which is heat-shrunk to cover the container tightly. The tight 
fit prevents the band from rotating when the cap is rotated. The 
band has a perforated line which is torn when the cap is unscrewed. 
A large amount of torque must be generated to remove

<CLAIMS>
A tamper-revealing container, comprising: 

a screw cap (1) threadable onto a container body (3) having 
a wall and a mouth, substantially covered by said screw cap 

(1) when said screw cap is threaded onto said container 
body; 
an annular band (2) attached to the lower end of said screw 
cap (1) and at least partially surrounding said container 

body (3); 
said annular band (2) attached to said screw cap (1) with a 
first attachment strength requiring a first torque to 

separate said screw cap (1) from said annular band (2) by 
rotating said screw cap (1) relative to said annular band 

(2); characterized in that 
a fixing element (4) is provided between said annular band (2) and said 
wall; in that 
said fixing element (4) is engageable on one side of said 
fixing element with said wall such that a second torque is 

required to rotate said fixing element (4) relative to said 
wall by rotating said fixing element (4) relative to said 

container body (3); in that 
said fixing element (4) is engageable on another side of said 
fixing element with said annular band (2) such that a third 

torque is required to rotate said annular band relative to 
said fixing member (4) by rotating said annular band 

relative to said fixing element; 
said annular band being peelable from said screw cap (1), 
and detachable thereby, from said screw cap (1) and said 

wall; and in that 
said first torque is greater than either of said second 
and third torques. 
A tamper-revealing container according to claim 1,

said first torque is substantially greater than a fourth 
torque, in Newton-centimetres, which is equal in magnitude 

to a square of a diameter of said screw cap in centimetres. 
A tamper-revealing container according to claim 1,

said fixing element (4) is engageable on said one side 
of said fixing element by a projection on one of said 

container body (3) and said fixing element and an edge on
