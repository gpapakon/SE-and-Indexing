<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a machine to draw bars, as set
forth in the preamble of the main claim.Such a bar drawing machine
consists substantially of a drawing assembly which comprises
a pair of opposed contrarotating chains of the type
disclosed in EP-A-548723, for instance, and is positioned
downstream of a drawplate or die.Such a drawing machine is applied
in the field of continuous straight drawing of metallic bars
or tubes.Drawing machines of the state of the art consist of an
element called a die to reduce the section of the product
being drawn and of means which are positioned downstream of
the drawplate die and are suitable to carry out lengthwise
drawing of the bar to be drawn.An initial segment of the bar to be drawn is prepared with
a cross-section smaller than the size of the die, so that in
an initial step this segment can be passed through the die
and be attached to the drawing assembly.The continuous drawing means comprising the drawing
assembly generally consist of a device comprising two
opposed chains or tracks, which consist of a series of links
to which are fitted the blocks or grippers that act on the
two opposite sides of the segment of bar which has already
been passed through the die.These chains are set in continuous rotation and cooperate
with rigid guides; they clamp the drawn bar and draw it in a
straight line.The embodiments of the state of the art often entail the
drawback of not being able to ensure a perfect clamping of
the bar between the links of the chains, particularly after 
prolonged use of the drawing machine.This situation often leads to sliding of the bar between
the chains and therefore involves variations of the speed of
feed of the bar as compared to the peripheral speed of the
chains, thus causing quick and premature wear of the
clamping grippers.Moreover, the drawing devices of the state of the art
cannot be adapted quickly to changes of sizes of the section
of the drawplate.The state of the art includes devices suitable to adjust
the distance between centres of the drawing chains in
relation to the drawing axis so as to ensure efficient
clamping of the bar to be drawn during each working step.US-A-2,797,798 discloses a drawing assembly in which the
adjustment of the distance between centres of the chains is
carried out by means of a first mechanical pressure applied
directly to the tracks and a second pressure with use of a
fluid, this second pressure too being applied directly to
the tracks. The mechanical pressure is performed by using
wedge means, which

<CLAIMS>
Machine for drawing bars, comprising a drawing die
assembly and an associated drawing assembly (11), the

drawing assembly comprising two endless chains (13,113)
installed on a respective upper (27) and lower supporting

plates (127) and disposed on either side of a drawing path,
each chain comprising a series of links (44) fitted with

gripper blocks (45) for clamping the drawn bar by acting on
the two opposite sides of the bar segment having been passed

through the drawing die (12), the distance between the two
chain assemblies being adjustable by means of a rotatable

adjustment means (59a, 59b) in order to reciprocatingly vary
the distance between the gripper blocks (45) defining the

drawing path, the drawing assembly further comprising means
(16) for driving the chains (13,113) in continuous rotation,

the direction of rotation of the one chain being opposite to
the direction of rotation of the other chain, the machine

further comprising grippers (17) downstream of the drawing
die (12), means for momentarily actuating the grippers (17)

in order to clamp an initial bar segment with reduced cross
section protruding through the drawing die (12), and a first

jack actuating means (22) for carrying out a relative
movement between the grippers (17) and the drawing die (12),

characterised in that the machine comprises a toroidal load
cell (33) which is disposed in such manner as to be capable

of measuring the drawing force exerted during drawing by
ther bar on the drawing die (12), the load cell (33) for

this purpose cooperating with the support (47) of the
drawing die (12), the load cell (33) being associated with a

control unit (57) for controlling actuating means (32)
