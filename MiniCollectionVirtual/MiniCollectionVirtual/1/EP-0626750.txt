<ABSTRACT>
A booster comprises first to fourth boosting circuits which receive first to fourth signals and provide first to fourth boosted 
potentials to first to fourth nodes, respectively; a first precharge circuit which is controlled by the fourth boosted potential of the 

fourth node in order to precharge a first node; a second precharge circuit which is controlled by the second boosted potential of 
the second node and precharges the third node; and a first output circuit which outputs the boosted potential to the first node. 

Since there is no voltage drop in each of the boosted potentials of the second and fourth nodes, it is possible to create a high potential 
difference in the first and third precharge circuits, and to output a specific boosted potential without lowering the speed at 

which the first and third nodes are precharged.

13-4 and first and second P-channel MOSFETs (hereinafter referred to 
PMOS) 14-1 and 14-2. The first and second inverters 11-1 and 11-2 drive respectively the 
first and second pulse signals S1 and S2 which are output from the signal 
generating circuit 1, thereby outputting third and fourth pulse signals S3 
and S4. The first capacitor 12-1 is connected to the output side of the first 
inverter 11-1 for boosting potential of a first node N1 in response to the  
 
third pulse signal S3. The second capacitor 12-2 is connected to the output 
side of the second inverter 11-2 for boosting potential of a second node N2 
in response to the fourth pulse signal S4. The first node N1 is connected 
to each source of the first and second NMOSs 13-1 and 13-2 which 
precharge the first node N1 and also connected to the drain of the first 
PMOS 14-1 which transfers the potential of the first node N1 to the output 
node N3. The first NMOS 13-1 is connected to a power potential Vcc at its 
drain and also connected to the second node N2 at its gate. The second 
NMOS 13-2 is connected to the power potential Vcc at its drain and gate. 
The second node N2 is connected to each source of the third and fourth 
NMOSs 13-3 and 13-4 which precharge the second node N2 and also 
connected to the drain of the second PMOS 14-2 for transferring the 
potential of the second node N2 to the output node N3. The third NMOS 13-3 
is connected to the power potential Vcc at its drain and also connected to 
the first node N1 at its gate. The fourth NMOS 13-4 is connected to the 
power potential Vcc at its drain and gate. The charge pump circuit 10 is set under the
