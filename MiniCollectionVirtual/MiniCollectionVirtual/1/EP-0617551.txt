<ABSTRACT>
A transmitter transmits a composite video signal and a 
multiplex signal on video carrier in a quadrature modulation 

method. A receiver synchronously detects an incoming signal 
with two orthogonal axes and separates the composite video 

signal from the multiplex signal to separately demodulate them. 
A crosstalk eliminator circuit to which the separately 

demodulated composite video signal and multiplex signal are 
supplied is connected in series with the ghost eliminator to 

eliminate ghost of the multiplex signal after eliminating 
crosstalk from the composite video signal to the multiplex 

signal. A waveform-equalized signal is obtained by adding a 
signal of only an inverse characteristic of crosstalk from the 

multiplex signal to the composite video signal with a decoded 
video signal. A non-linear extractor extracts non-linear 

crosstalk from the composite video signal, thereby obtaining a 
waveform-equalized multiplex signal by subtracting the non-linear 

crosstalk from the composite video signal to the 
multiplex signal from it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a 
television transmission system where a composite video signal, 
which is compatible with the existing television broadcasting 
system and effective to improve the picture quality and expand 
the picture aspect ratio, that is, a ratio of a longitudinal 
length to a transversal length of the picture, and a multiplex 
signal, which is effective to improve sound quality, are 
transmitted, more specifically to a waveform equalizer made use 
to regenerate such composite video signal and multiplex signal 
without interference on a receiver side in the television 
transmission system. Nearly forty years has been passed since a color 
television broadcasting in the present NTSC (National 
Television System Committee) system started. During which, a 
demand of viewers for high-definition picture gradually 
increased and various new television systems has been proposed 
with improvement in performance of a television receiver. Contents of programs provided to the viewers 
themselves are changing from mere studio programs or 
relay programs to pictures in a higher picture quality 
and with realism such as movie pictures in a cinema size. In 
recent years, a demand for a high quality sound or data  
 
broadcasting is increased more and more. The present 
broadcasting system has certain specifications (refer to, 
for example, "US Color Television Fundamentals - A Review", 
IEEE Trans. Consumer Electron., vol. CE-23.pp.467-478, Nov. 
1977) such as 525 scanning lines, 2:1 interlaced scanning, 
4.2 MHz luminance signal horizontal bandwidth and 4:3 aspect 
ratio. Under such circumstances, the first generation EDTV 
broadcasting system started in 1989 in Japan, whose major 
contents were maintenance of compatibility with the present 
television broadcasting system, transmission of reference 
signals for the purpose of providing a high quality picture 
or eliminating ghost disturbance. Wide screen is considered to be the second EDTV 
system. There is, for example, a system for widening the 
screen where video signals of 480 active scanning lines per 
frame is made 360 on the receiver side and each upper and 
lower 60 lines are superimposed signals thereon which used 
to compensate vertical components of the video signals. 
This is one example of a so-called letter box system. This 
letter box system enables transmission of a wide aspect 
picture (with an aspect ratio of 16:9) while maintaining the 
compatibility with the present television broadcasting 
system. There is
