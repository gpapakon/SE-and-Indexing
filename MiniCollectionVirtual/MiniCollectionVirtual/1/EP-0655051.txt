<DESCRIPTION>
This invention belongs to the field of synthetic
organic chemistry. More particularly, it relates to a
process for preparing phenylterephthalic acid, an
intermediate in the synthesis of useful polyesters.GB-A-1 489 547 describes a process for producing
terephthalic acid with high purity by oxidation of p-xylene in
the presence of a molecular oxygen containing gas and a
cobaltous/manganese/bromine oxidation catalyst system.Phenylterephthalic acid is valuable as an
interemediate in the preparation of liquid crystalline
polyesters. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,391,966
describes the use of phenylterephthalic acid in
preparing melt-spinnable, anisotropic melt forming
aromatic polyesters. Further, E. K. Weisburger and
J. H. Weisburger describe the reaction of 2,5-xylyl-magnesium
bromide with either cyclohexanone or
3-bromocyclohexene to provide 1-(2,5-xylyl)cyclohexene,
which is then dehydrogenated using sulfur to provide
2,5-dimethylbiphenyl, which is oxidized by KMnO4 to
provide phenylterephthalic acid in 74% yield. The
permangenate process provides an isolation and
purification problem, since a relatively large amount of
manganese waste is produced.The present invention provides a three step process
for preparing 2-phenylterephthalic acid starting with p-xylene,
followed by alkylation, dehydrogenation, and
oxidation of the methyl groups corresponding to the
origional p-xylene.The present invention provides a process for
preparing a compound of Formula (1),

wherein R1 is phenyl, which comprises the steps 
(a) alkylating a compound of the formula

with cyclohexene in the presence of an acid
catalyst to provide a compound of Formula (2),

wherein R2 is cyclohexyl;
followed by(b) dehydrogenation; and(c) oxidation in the presence of air or oxygen and
a cobaltous/bromide oxidation catalyst system, at a
temperature of 75°C to 250°C, and at a pressure of
68.95 kPa to 6.895 MPa gauge (10 to 1000 psig).In the experimental section below, it is noted that
monoalkylation and dialkylation occurs thereby resulting
in a mixture that may be easily purified by conventional
physical separation methodology, e.g., distillation,
extraction, and crystallization.In the alkylation step, p-xylene is reacted with
cyclohexene (or generated insitu with cyclohexanol) in
the presence of an acidic catalyst. In this context, p-xylene
is normally used as both reactant as well as
solvent. Unreacted p-xylene can be readily recovered
and recycled. The reaction will yield a mixture of
mono- and di-alkylated product. If more dialkylated
