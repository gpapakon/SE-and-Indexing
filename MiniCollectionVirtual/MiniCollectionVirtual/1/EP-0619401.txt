<ABSTRACT>
In a method for adjusting the position of elongated elements, preferably 
the rails of a railway track, a laser equipment (8) is fixed to the 

elongated element (2) and there is from the laser equipment emitted 
a laser beam against a first reflector (12), which is fixed at at 

distance from the laser equipment along the elongated element (2). 
Thereby there is defined a straight reference plane (16). The section 

of the elongated element positioned between the laser equipment (8) 
and the first reflector (12) is then adjusted into correct position by 

displacing said section in lateral direction to a predetermined distance 
from the reference plane (16) by means of a second reflector (18). 

A device for adjusting the position of elongated element, preferably 
the rails of a railway track, comprises a laser equipment (8) and at 

least one reflector (12) for receiving the laser beam from the laser 
equipment and reflecting the beam back to the laser equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for adjusting the position 
of elongated elements, preferably the rails of a railway track, in at 
least one plane and a device for carrying out the method. When laying railway tracks the rails are placed on and fixed to sleepers 
in approximately the position which the track shall finally have. After 
the laying operation the track is adjusted to the exactly correct position 
by lateral displacement or slewing of the sleepers supporting the rails. 
The adjustment of the position is according to conventional technique 
conducted by means of conventional levelling instruments requiring a 
time-consuming and laborious operation. Also in respect of the accuracy 
of the adjustment operation the previously known technique involves certain 
shortcomings which is a drawback especially when laying railway tracks for 
traffic with high train speeds. In recent times one has begun to use laser technique for adjusting the 
position of railway tracks but the laser technique has been used according 
to the same principle as in the use of conventional levelling instruments. 
This, it has by means of the use of the laser technique been possible to 
improve the accuracy of the adjustment of the position of the railway tracks 
while the use of the laser technique has not provided any solution to the 
other drawbacks of the previously known technique. The object of the invention is to provide a method for adjusting the 
position of elongated elements, preferably rails of railway tracks, in at 
least one plane and a device for carrying out the method, wherein the use 
of the laser technique provides for a rapid, accurate and labour-saving 
adjustment operation. In order to comply with this object the method according to the invention 
is characterized in that a laser equipment comprising a laser source and 
a receiver is fixed to the elongated element, preferably a railway rail, 
for emitting towards a first reflector and receiving therefrom a laser 
beam, the source and the receiver being thereby positioned in a predetermined 
lateral position in relation to the elongated element, that the first 
reflector is fixed at a distance from the laser equipment along the elongated 
element in a position in which it is hit by and reflects the laser beam 
emitted by the laser equipment so as to define a straight reference plane 
positioned between the laser source and the first reflector, and that the 
section of the elongated element positioned between the laser equipment and  
 
the first
