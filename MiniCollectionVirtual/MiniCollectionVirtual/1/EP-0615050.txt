<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cutter (10) 
for cutting the ends from a mini blind (131) so that the 

mini blind (131) may be custom sized for a particular 
window opening. The mini blind cutter (10) includes a 

framework (11) which has a receiving area (24, 26) for 
receiving an end of the mini blind (131). A cutter blade 

(31) is attached to a slide bar (30) which is slidably 
mounted in the framework (11). The slide bar (30) 

includes a rack (96) engaged with a pinion gear (84) that 
is rotated by a ratchet handle (40). Movement of the 

ratchet handle (40) thus slides the slide bar (30) along 
the framework (11) and forces the cutter blade (31) 

through the end of the mini blind (131).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
art of sizing window coverings, such as mini blinds.
More particularly, the present invention relates to a
cutter for cutting a plurality of adjacent layers of
material and includes a ratcheting mechanism that
facilitates continuous cutting pressure against the
material being cut to ensure a high quality cut.Numerous types of window coverings are now
being sold at a variety of outlets. Window coverings of
the type with which the present invention is concerned
include mini blinds as opposed to draperies and curtains
which may be sold in the same outlets but which involve
different sizing requirements.The types of outlets that sell mini blinds
include custom specialty shops and department stores
which usually ask the customer for window dimensions and
then submit orders to factories or distribution centers
where the products are cut to a specific size. Not only
must the customer make two visits to these outlets to
obtain the product, but the custom mini blinds are
relatively expensive.Mass merchandisers also distribute mini blinds.
In many such outlets, only stocked sizes are carried,
because some windows, especially in newer homes and
offices, are of standard dimensions. These mini blinds 
are usually much less expensive than those obtained from
custom outlets because of the economies realized from
carrying a limited stock of sizes, and because there are
no sizing operations which must be performed on the
products.In recent years, a third option has been made
available to the customer. This option involves the in-store
sizing of mini blinds and various other window
coverings to customer specifications. An example of how
in-store sizing can be accomplished is disclosed in
commonly owned United States Patent No. 5,072,494, issued
December 17, 1991 to Graves et al. for "Method and
Apparatus for Infinitely Sizing a Mini Blind" and its
parent, United States Patent No. 4,993,131, issued
February 19, 1991 to the same inventors and with the same
title. In the device shown in these patents, mini blinds
of a specific design are sized to customer specifications
on a machine. The mini blind itself includes a head
rail, a bottom rail, a plurality of slats, a tilter bar,
and a rope system having ladders for raising and lowering
the slats and for locking the blind in a desired open or
closed position. The mini blind product used with the
system illustrated in these two patents includes one
ladder fixed in place. The other ladder is not installed
at the factory, but is

<CLAIMS>
A mini blind cutter (10) for downsizing a mini
blind (131) by cutting off an end of the mini blind (131), the

mini blind (131) being of the type that includes a head rail
(132), a bottom rail (134), and a plurality of slats (136),

the mini blind cutter (10) comprising a framework (11), a receiving
area (24, 26) disposed within the framework (11) for

receiving the end of the mini blind (131), a slide bar assembly
(30) slidably mounted in the framework (11), the slide bar

assembly (30) being oriented for sliding motion towards and
away from the receiving area (24, 26), the slide bar assembly

(30) including a rack (96) having a plurality of teeth (98),

a cutter blade (31) affixed to the slide bar assembly
(30) and including a cutting edge (70) disposed towards

the receiving area (24, 26);
a drive means (84) mounted in the framework (11) in
mating engagement with the rack (96); and

a ratchet handle (40) mechanically coupled to the drive
means (84) to impart sliding motion to the slide bar
assembly (30), 
characterized
 by:
a first receiving area (24) for receiving the mini
blind bottom rail (134) and the plurality of slats (136);
a second receiving area (26) for receiving the head
rail (132), the first receiving area (24) and second recieving

area (26) being separated by a shear plate (42) against which
the plurality of slats (136) are disposed during cutting;
an anvil (44) disposed in the second receiving area
(26) at a location sufficiently spaced from the shear plate

(42) to receive at least a portion of the head rail (132)
therebetween.
The mini blind cutter (10) of claim 1, further

characterized
 in that the drive means (84) is a pinion gear.
The mini blind cutter (10) of claim 2, further

characterized
 in that the anvil (44) inludes an external
profile (49) contoured to match the interior of the head rail

(132). 
The mini blind cutter (10) of claim 3,
further characterized in that the anvil (44) includes a

V-shaped cut-out portion (76).
The mini blind cutter (10) of claim 4,
