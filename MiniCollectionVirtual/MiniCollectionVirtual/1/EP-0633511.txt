<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging 
apparatus and a process cartridge for charging a 
member to be charged such as a photosensitive member 
or a dielectric member. Heretofore, in an image forming apparatus 
such as an electrophotographic apparatus (copying 
machine), laser beam printer or the like, or an 
electrostatic recording apparatus, corona discharges 
are widely used as a means for electrically charging 
or discharging a member to be charged such as the 
photosensitive member or the dielectric member, by 
which the surface of the member to be charged is 
exposed to corona produced by the corona discharger. Recently, a contact type charging means has 
been developed, in which a charging member (conductive 
member) in the form of a roller or blade is supplied 
with a voltage, and is contacted to the member to be 
charged, by which the surface is charged. Here, the charging member is not necessarily 
contacted to the surface to be charged. The non-contact 
(proximity) is usable if a dischargeable 
region determined by a gap voltage and a corrected 
Paschen's curve is assured between the charging member 
and the surface to be charged.  As contrasted to the corona discharging 
device comprising a wire and a shield, the contact or 
proximity charging is advantageous in that the voltage 
required for charging the surface to be charged to a 
predetermined level can be reduced, that the amount of 
ozone produced in the charging process is very small 
so that the necessity for an ozone removing filter is 
eliminated, that the exhausting system can be 
simplified, the maintenance operation is not required, 
and the structure is made simple. As proposed in U.S. Patent No. 4,851,960 
regarding the contact or proximity charging, which has 
been assigned to the assignee of this application, it 
is preferable from the standpoint of uniform charging 
(discharging) that an oscillating voltage, 
particularly, an oscillating voltage having a peak-to-peak 
voltage not less than twice a charge starting 
voltage at which the charging start for the member to 
be charged only when a DC voltage is applied, is 
applied to the charging member (oscillating voltage 
application type, i.e., AC application type). With such an apparatus, the member to be 
charged or the image bearing member and the charging 
member are contacted with the result of tendency of 
toner or the like fusing on the image bearing member. 
If this occurs, improper charging may occur. With 
long time use with the charging member kept in contact
