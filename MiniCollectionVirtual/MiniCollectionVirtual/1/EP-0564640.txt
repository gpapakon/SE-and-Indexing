<DESCRIPTION>
 DRY MICROPARTICULATED PROTEIN PRODUCTThe present invention relates generally to a dry microparticulated protein product which is useful as a substitute for fat in food products, and more particularly to a spray dried, free-flowing microparticulated protein product which is readily rehydrated to give a fat substitute having desirable physical and organoleptic characteristics.BACKGROUND The consumption of fat-rich foods enjoys considerable popularity in and makes up a significant portion of the diets of many people. The undesirable nutritional impact related to the practice of consuming popular fat containing foods is widely recognized in the food industry and ways to reduce the fat content of food products are being developed to address the problems caused by consuming fat-rich foods.One way to reduce the fat content of foods involves replacing the normal fat content of a food with a microparticulated protein product which has been described by Singer et al., U.S. Patents 4,734,287 and 4,961,953. The disclosure of both of these patents is incorporated by reference herein for the purpose of generally describing the desired physical and organoleptic characteristics of microparticulated protein. The microparticulated protein product described by Singer et al. is characterized as a macrocolloid of properly sized spheroidal protein particles formed by heating soluble proteins under high shear conditions. Controlled heat and shear processes are used to form an aqueous dispersion of denatured protein particles having a range of sizes providing organoleptic characteristics that closely mimic the 

 characteristics and properties of fat. This aqueous solution contains a mixture of protein microparticles, other solubilized proteins, sugars and starches as well as various salts, minerals and small amounts of insoluble materials.Although the aqueous microparticulated protein product has been found to be an excellent substitute for the unwanted fat in a variety of food products (such as salad dressings, baked goods, coffee whitener, natural and processed cheeses, cream cheese, yogurt, puddings, soups, sauces, frostings, spreads, whipped toppings, ice cream and frozen desserts and related cultured dairy products) aqueous or liquid food ingredients typically have some undesirable attributes. For example, aqueous protein or other nutrient- containing ingredients are very susceptible to microbial contamination and extensive efforts may be needed to prevent undesired microbial contamination.Similarly, aqueous

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A dry microparticulated protein product comprising: a spheroidal agglomerate of microparticulated protein capable of rehydrating to provide substantially nonaggregated, spheroidal particles of denatured protein.
2. A dry microparticulated protein product of claim 1 wherein the nonaggregated spheroidal particles of denatured protein have a mean diameter greater than about 0.1 micron.
3. A dry microparticulated protein product of claim 1 wherein the nonaggregated spheroidal particles of denatured protein have a mean diameter less than about 3 microns.
4. A dry microparticulated protein product of claim 1 wherein the protein is derived from undenatured substantially soluble protein.
5. A dry microparticulated protein product of claim 1 wherein the protein is derived from the group consisting of whey, bovine serum albumin, egg white albumin, soy and mixtures thereof.
6. A dry microparticulated protein product of claim 1 wherein the protein is derived from whey. 


 7. A dry microparticulated protein product of claim 6 wherein the whey protein particles have a mean diameter greater than about 0.1 micron.
8. An aqueous dispersion of microparticulated protein prepared by rehydrating the dry microparticulated protein product of claim 1.
9. A dry, free-flowing protein product comprising: a spheroidal agglomerate of a soluble proteinaceous matrix and microparticulated protein wherein the agglomerate is hydratable to provide substantially nonaggregated, spheroidal particles of denatured protein having substantially smooth, emulsion-like organoleptic character when hydrated.
10. A dry protein product of claim 9 wherein the nonaggregated spheroidal particles of denatured protein have a mean diameter greater than about 0.1 micron.
11. A dry protein product of claim 9 wherein the nonaggregated spheroidal particles of denatured protein have a mean diameter less than about 3 microns.
12. A dry protein product of claim 9 wherein the protein is derived from undenatured substantially soluble protein.
13. A dry protein product of claim 9 wherein the protein is derived from the group consisting of 


whey, bovine serum albumin, egg white albumin, soy and mixtures thereof.
14. A dry protein product of claim 9 wherein the protein is derived from whey.
15. A dry protein product of claim 14 wherein the whey protein particles have a mean diameter greater than about 0.1 micron.
