<ABSTRACT>
An output buffer circuit is disclosed that operates in low voltage 
applications but can be programmed using standard programmers at high 

voltage. The output buffer circuit provides for detecting a program verify logic 
signal from the programmer and slowing the output driver transistors when that 

signal is detected. In so doing, the noise problems associated with the higher 
voltages of programming a EPROM device are eliminated while at the same 

time allowing the output buffer circuit to operate at the required performance 
levels during normal operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an output buffer circuit for use
in low voltage devices such as EPROM devices and preferably relates
to an improvement to the
output buffer circuit which allows for programming the EPROM device without
noise problems and without affecting the performance of the output buffer
circuit during normal operation.Output buffer circuits are utilized extensively in Electrical Programming
Read Only Memory (EPROM) devices for providing an output voltage
responsive to an input signal. New EPROM devices, such as the Am27C020
and Am27LV020, manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices, Incorporated are
capable of storing information at low voltages. What is meant by low voltage
in the context of this application is between 2.7 and 3.6 volts.Speed is a very important component of output buffer circuits at these
low voltages. Hence, in designing these devices, particularly the output buffer
circuit, it is important that they operate efficiently at these low voltages.
However, it is known that there are problems when programming a low voltage
EPROM circuit. For example, it is known that many existing programmer
circuits are very poorly grounded in use and when the program verify mode is
used, a EPROM could fail.In addition, ground bounce or ringing on the output device has been a
significant problem in programming these types of circuits using traditional
programming techniques. Typically, 6 volts or more are required to ensure that 
the EPROM is properly programmed. Hence, one way to solve the problem is
to program the devices at the lower voltages to prevent ringing. However, to
program the devices at lower voltages would require significant modifications
to existing programming techniques.Another way of solving the problem would be to utilize a circuit design
which would minimize the ground bounce problem associated with
programming these low voltage EPROM devices. But in so doing, the
performance characteristics of the device would be significantly reduced during
normal low voltage operation. Hence, the device would no longer be optimized
for speed and would not perform efficiently. Hence, what is needed is an
improved output buffer circuit that would allow for the high speed performance
characteristic associated with low voltage EPROM devices but at the same time
minimizing the noise problems associated with the programming of such a low
voltage EPROM device.We will describe circuitry for addressing the above-mentioned
need.We will describe an output buffer circuit which operates
efficient
