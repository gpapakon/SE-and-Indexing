<ABSTRACT>
Liquid dispensing device, including a dispenser (1) mounted on a container (2) containing the said liquid (3), in which the liquid forms a free surface (4) in the container and the dispenser includes an inlet orifice (5) which is arranged above the said free surface (4) during normal operation of the dispenser, characterised in that the dispenser is a pump including a pump body (7) and in that the device includes a liquid retention member (6) which communicates with the inlet orifice (5) of the pump (1) and with the container (2), the said liquid retention member (6) being designed to receive a certain volume of liquid (15) when the device is agitated or inclined with respect to an upright position, with the pump (1) above the container (2) and designed to keep the said volume of liquid (15) in communication with the said inlet orifice (5) of the pump when the device is in the said upright position.

<CLAIMS>
A liquid dispenser device without propellant including a
dispenser (1) mounted on a receptacle (2) containing said

liquid (3),

in which the liquid forms a free surface (4) inside the
receptacle and the dispenser includes an inlet orifice (5)

which is disposed above said free surface (4) in the upright
position of the device, in which the dispenser (1) is partly

above the receptacle (2), said upright position being the
actuating position of the device,
the device including a liquid retention member (6) which
communicates with said inlet orifice (5) and with the

receptacle (2), said liquid retention member being adapted to
received a certain volume of liquid (15) when the device is

shaken or tilted relative to its upright position, and said
liquid retention member being adapted to retain said volume of

liquid (15) in communication with said inlet orifice (5) when
the device is in said upright position,

characterized in that the dispenser is a pump (1) including a
pump body (7), and in that said retention member (6) includes

a bottom (16) and a side wall (17) having an outside diameter
that is slightly less than the inside diameter of the neck

(2a) of the receptacle, the retention member (6) further
including flexible tabs (18) disposed around the top edge of

its side wall (17) and flaring towards the neck of the
receptacle in a direction that makes an angle with the

vertical, to make sure that the retention member is completely
filled.
A device according to claim 1, in which the retention
member is in the form of a cup (6) which is disposed around

and beneath the pump (1) when the device is in its upright
position.
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which said
retention member (6) is fixed to the pump body (7). 
A device according to claim 3, in which said retention
member (6) is engaged on the bottom end (7a) of the pump body

(7) by means of ribs (12).
A device according to any preceding claim, in which the top
ends of said flexible tabs (18) form a notional circle whose

diameter is greater than said inside diameter of the neck of
the receptacle, said flexible tabs (18) being capable of

folding inwards when the said retention member (6) is put into
place inside the neck of the receptacle and then of returning

to their flared shape, while the pump (1) is being mounted on
the receptacle (2).
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which said
retention member (6) is fixed to the neck (2a) of the

receptacle.
A device according to any preceding claim, in which the
pump body (7) has ribs or grooves (50) in its portion situated

inside the container serving to retain a certain quantity of
liquid when the device is tilted or shaken, said quantity of

liquid then flowing along the pump body into the retention
member (6) under the effect of gravity when the device is put

back into the upright position.
A device according to any preceding claim, having an
outside shape such as it can be put down in a stable manner,

only in a tilted or upside-down position.
A device according to any preceding claim, in which the
receptacle (2) is made of transparent material.
