<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the value of a physical variable 
such as pressure, distance, volume or the like, comprises 

the following steps: 

a) Generating a magnetic flux density distribution (44.1, 
44.2) in a volume (42) filled with a ferrofluid (43); 
b) changing the volume (42) responsive to the value of the 
physical variable; 
c) measuring the variation of the flux density distribution 
(44.1, 44.2) which is caused by the change of the volume 

(2) in order to determine the value of the physical 
variable. 
A differential pressure transducer according to the method 
uses a ferrofluid contained in two interconnecting chambers, 

enclosed by two non-magnetic spring diaphragms. At least one 
inductance circuit measures the variations in the volumes of 

ferrofluid in the interconnecting chambers. Changes in 
pressure displaces the non-magnetic spring diaphragms, 

causing the volume in each in the connecting chamber to 
change in a differential manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for determining the value 
of a physical variable such as pressure, distance, volume or 
the like. It also relates to a transducer according to that 
method.  Pressure transducers provide pressure measurements for many 
applications from scientific experiments to control of 
industrial systems and machines. In these applications, 
pressure changes need to be measured and converted into 
electrical signals representing the pressure changes. In 
some instances, a differential pressure transducer is used 
to detect pressure differences between two applied bias 
pressures. In many cases the media being measured is 
corrosive or conductive and requires a "wet/wet" 
differential pressure transducer. This type of transducer 
has two pressure ports which may be exposed to the process 
media without damage to the sensitive pressure measuring 
apparatus. The common technologies for measuring this 
phenomenon are capacitance or reluctance devices requiring 
complex alternating current electronics and multiple passive 
isolation diaphragms. Bonded foil strain gauge devices are 
also commonly used with passive isolation diaphragms, but 
are not practical for the low differential pressure ranges 
common in these applications. U.S. Patent No. 4,462,259 describes a manometer type 
differential pressure gauge using a column of ferrofluid to 
act as the dielectric medium between two plates on either 
side of the column, forming a capacitor. The length of the 
ferrofluid in the column is dependent upon an applied 
pressure differential, so that the capacitance in the 
capacitor thus formed is dependent upon the applied 
pressure. A magnetic field is used to act on the magnetic fluid to 
bias the slug of fluid toward the reference position. The  
 
magnetic field creates an additional force which adds to the 
gravitational forces acting on the magnetic field, a given 
column length of the magnetic liquid can represent a 
pressure differential which is larger than that obtained 
absent the application of the magnetic field. This design, however, can only be used with clean gases, as 
the ferrofluid is exposed to the process medium. If high 
over-pressure situations develop, the ferrofluid could be 
expelled from the manometer tube. Devices made according to 
this design also require complex AC electronics to convert 
the differential column height of the ferrofluid to a 
useable electric signal. U.S. Patent No. 4,788,867 describes a pressure transducer 
having a permanent magnetic "piston",
