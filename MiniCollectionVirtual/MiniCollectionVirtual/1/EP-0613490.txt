<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to printing inks which exhibit reduced abrasiveness towards printing surfaces such
as gravure cylinders. The printing inks will contain the usual pigment and aqueous or non-aqueous solvent
(or mixture of such solvents) along with desired binders, fillers, waxes, etc. The printing inks of the present
invention exhibit reduced abrasiveness.Abrasion by printing ink on printing ink surfaces has continued to plague the industry. The problem is
most severe in the case of gravure printing wherein after long printing runs, the surfaces of the doctor blade
and the gravure cylinder wear out. This in turn causes "hazing" or "scumming", i.e. printing in the non-image
areas. The phenomenon is particularly acute when water-based inks are used in place of non-aqueous
inks. Environmental, health and safety considerations dictate that, to the extent possible, solvents
such as hydrocarbons, alcohols, glycols, glycol ethers, ketones and esters be replaced with water. Thus,
solving the abrasion problem would provide a greater incentive to printers to utilize water-based inks.Abrasion of the printing surfaces is, no doubt, related to factors such as the type of pigment, pigment
crystal morphology, pigment particle size, etc. It is thought that water provides less lubricity than solvents.
However, incorporation of materials thought in the prior art to provide lubricity such as waxes, stearates, etc.
have had little effect in reducing the abrasion caused by water-based inks after long printing runs.It has now been discovered that the abrasiveness of both aqueous and non-aqueous printing inks
towards printing surfaces is significantly reduced
by an ink as defined in claim 1.Preferably, the alkoxyl moiety of the alkoxylated dibasic phosphate ester contains 2 - 8, most preferably
4 - 6, carbon atoms, and the alcohol moiety of the alkoxylated dibasic phosphate ester contains 5 - 10,
most preferably 7 - 10 carbon atoms, e.g. aromatic alcohol groups. The alkoxylated dibasic phosphate ester
is generally present in an amount of about 2 - 6, preferably 3 - 5, wt.%, based on the weight of the printing
ink.The alkali metal salt of the dialkylsulfosuccinic ester comprises sodium, and each dialkyl
moiety contains 8 - 16, preferably 8 - 13 carbon atoms. Most preferably, the dialkylsulfosuccinic acid ester
comprises a mixture of two different dialkylsulfosuccinic esters, one in which the dialkyl moieties are
branched chain ethylhexyl groups, and the other in which the dialkyl moieties are tridecyl. Generally, the
