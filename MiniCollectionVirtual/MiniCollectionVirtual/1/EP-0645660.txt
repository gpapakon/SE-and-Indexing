<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
crystal display device and a method for producing the
same. More particularly, the present invention relates
to a liquid crystal display device in which liquid
crystal regions are surrounded by polymeric walls and a
method for producing the same.Conventional liquid crystal display devices
utilize a variety of display modes as follows: As
liquid crystal display devices utilizing an electro-optic
effect, a twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal
display device and a super-twisted nematic (STN) liquid
crystal display using nematic liquid crystal have been
put into practical use; and a liquid crystal display
device utilizing a ferroelectric liquid crystal has
been proposed. Such liquid crystal display devices
require to be provided with a polarizing plate and to
undergo an alignment treatment. Other liquid crystal
display devices requiring no polarizing plate, which
utilize a dynamic scattering (DS) effect and a phase
change (PC) effect have also been proposed. The cell
therein has no polymeric wall in the display region.Recently, as a liquid crystal display device
requiring neither a polarizing plate nor an alignment
treatment, a display device utilizing the birefringence
of liquid crystal so as to electrically control the
transparent state and the opaque state has been proposed.
Such a liquid crystal display device, which is 
designated as a polymer dispersed liquid crystal display
device, includes a pair of substrates sandwiching
a display medium including liquid crystal droplets
dispersed in a polymeric material. In the polymer
dispersed liquid crystal display device, the liquid
crystal molecules are uniformly oriented under the
application of a voltage. As a result, the refractive
index of the liquid crystal molecule with respect to
ordinary light is matched with the refractive index of
the polymeric material, which is a supporting medium,
thereby displaying the transparent state. When no
voltage is applied, the liquid crystal molecules are
not oriented and cause light scattering, thereby displaying
the opaque state.An example of the production method for such
a liquid crystal display device includes a method in
which a liquid crystal is contained in a polymeric
capsule disclosed in Japanese National Publication
No. 58-501631. Another example is disclosed in Japanese
National Publication No. 61-502128, in which a
liquid crystal material is mixed with a polymeric
material including a photopolymerizable material or a
thermosetting material, and the polymeric material
