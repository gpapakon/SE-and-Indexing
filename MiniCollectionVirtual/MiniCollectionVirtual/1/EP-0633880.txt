<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING 2-HALO-NICOTINIC ACID DERIVATIVES AND PRECURSORS THERETOBACKGROUNDThe present invention generally relates to processes for producing 2-halo-nicotinic acid derivatives and precursors thereto. In a highly preferred aspect, the invention relates to a synthesis of 2-halo-nicotinic acid derivative compounds which includes reacting a 2-halonitrile with an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone to give a 4-halo-4-cyano carbonyl compound, fo.ilowed by a cyclocondensation reaction to afford the 2-halo-nicotinic acid derivative. The 2-halonitrile can optionally be prepared in. situ by reacting 2,2-dihalonitrile with the parent nitrile.As background, 2-halo-nicotinic acid and its derivatives are highly useful in many organic synthetic applications, and in one facet represent an important class of agricultural and pharmaceutical intermediates. For example, 2-chloronicotinic acid and its amides have been the subject of much patent literature (See e.g. Chiang et al., EP 323,881 (1989), Cramp et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,618,366 (1986), Gutman, U.S. Patent No. 4,251,263 (1981), Oda et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,840,959 (1989), and Hoffmann et al., U.S. Patent Nos. 3,466,373 (1968) and 3,415,834 (1969)).Prior known methods of preparing 2-halo-nicotinic acid derivatives typically involve manipulation of a functional group on an existing pyridine ring. For example, Lisac, Spanish Patent No. ES 501,988 (1981) discloses the preparation of 2-chloronicotinic acid by oxidation of 2-chloro-3-methylpyridine at 190° to 210°C in the presence of a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Japanese Patent: Kokai 58-213760 (published December 12, 1983) and Haga et 

al., U.S. Patent No. 4,504,665 (1985) describe the synthesis of 2-chloronicotinic acid by hydrolysis of 2-chloro-3-trichloromethylpyridine. Both of these methods harbor significant disadvantages, including that they generally require starting materials that are difficult to selectively prepare.2-Chloronicotinitrile has been also prepared by treating nicotinamide N-oxide with a mixture of phosphorous pentachloride and phosphorous oxychloride, as described by Taylor et al., J. Org. Chem. , 1954, 19, 1633. Similar N-oxide-based preparations of 2-chloronicotinic acid are described by Richter et al., Hungarian Patent No. 221161 (1982), Said, U.S. Patent No. 4,144,238 (1979) and Naoi et al., Japanese Patent: Kokai 59-144759 (published August 18, 1984). However, these N-oxide-based approaches are complicated by contamination by regioisomers (mainly 6-chloro
