<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to robots and, 
also, to apparatus for composing video source material. In the production of audiovisual films, videos, 
television commercials, movies, and the like, a video 
camera is used to record video images and/or audio signals 
on a video tape. The video tape may be carried directly by 
the camera, as in a video camcorder, or the video images 
from a video camera may be output to a video tape recorder 
(VTR) which records the video images on a video tape. The 
video tape can then be played back to review the recorded 
images. As frequently occurs during the production of 
audiovisual materials, it is oftentimes necessary to re-shoot 
some portion of the recorded sequence of images. 
When this occurs, the video tape must be rewound to the 
desired position or frame to enable new video images to be 
recorded over old images or new video images are recorded 
on a separate tape. After the new and old images are 
recorded on different tapes, the two video tapes are then 
edited by merging the desired portions of the two tapes 
into a single tape to form the desired sequence of video 
images. A number of video tape editing devices are 
available to perform such editing operations. Time code generators are also well known and are 
used to generate standardized time codes. Such time codes 
are developed according to standards set by the SMPTE 
(Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) and 
the EBU (European Broadcasting Union). The time codes are 
formed of a binary code corresponding to hours, minutes, 
seconds and frame number of each frame of a video signal 
starting from a zero point and continuing during the entire 
video image running time. The time code information is 
encoded onto a recording medium by a video tape recorder on 
a separate track from the tracks containing the video  
 
information for each frame of the video signal. The 
recorded time code information acts as an address to 
identify each frame to permit electronic editing of video 
tapes. A time code generator as described above is disclosed 
in US-A-4 503 470. During editing, time code readers are employed to 
locate a particular frame on a video tape. However, such 
editing is a time consuming process requiring a 
considerable amount of skill and costly time code 
generators, time code readers and tape synchronizers which 
result in high post production costs to form a complete 
audiovisual tape. As described above, it is often necessary during 
the production of audiovisual material to
