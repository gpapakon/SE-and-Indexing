<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a casing for accommodating a control device (66) which is provided with components (92, 98) which generate heat. According to the invention, the casing consists of a die-cast casing which comprises a sidewall (4), a rear wall (6), a base (8), a cover (10), a front strut (12), a heat sink (16) and an air guidance device (18), and of a covering panel and a front cover, the cooling ribs (14), which run spatially parallel to the rear wall (16), of the heat sink ending in the plane of the sidewall (4) and being covered by a compartmentalisation sheet (28), the base (8) and the cover (10) each being provided with apertures (50) for heat dissipation from the front housing half and an aperture (48) for connecting leads (cables, lines) to pass through, and the front strut (12) being designed as a side frame part for the covering panel, which covers an access opening (2) on the side of the casing, and for the front cover which can close an opening in the front of the casing. A casing of book-size format is thus obtained for a control device (66), the number of parts required for assembly, the assembly cost and the assembly time being considerably reduced.
