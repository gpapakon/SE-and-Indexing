<ABSTRACT>
A relay lens system to be incorporated in an 
endoscopic optical assembly is provided. The relay lens 

system includes at least one relay lens module 42 for 
relaying an image between successive image planes. The 

relay lens module consists of two identical optical 
assemblies 44 arranged in bilateral symmetrical relation 

relative to a median plane disposed between the two 
assemblies. Each optical assembly includes a glass plano 

cylinder 46 and first 48 and second 50 curved lens 
components attached to each end of the plano cylinder. The 

lenses forming the lens components are fabricated from 
different optical materials including polymeric materials 

to correct aberrations within the system. The physical and 
geometrical characteristics of the components are selected 

to effectively transfer a bright image to the viewer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to endoscopic
optical systems and, in particular, to a relay lens system
for a disposable rigid endoscope.Endoscopes are optical instruments which permit
the examination of body cavities without the need for
extensive surgery. Conventional rigid endoscopes typically
include a pipe for illuminating a region of the body cavity
to be viewed and an optical lens system mounted in a tube
for focusing and relaying the illuminated image from inside
the body cavity to the physician. Essential optical
components of a conventional lens system include a front
combination of lenses constituting the objective lens, a
system of relay lenses to carry the image through the scope
and an eye lens which produces a magnified virtual image
for the viewer. Examples of such optical systems for
endoscopes are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,089,484 to
Hett, 3,257,902 to Hopkins, 3,556,085 to Takahashi,
4,036,218 to Yamashita, 4,267,828 to Matsuo and 4,273,110
to Groux.There are several drawbacks in the endoscopes of
the prior art, specifically with regard to the complexity
and expense of the optical systems incorporated therein.
The optical components are typically made of glass that is
ground and polished by expensive manufacturing techniques.
As a result, the cost of these instruments is relatively 
high which thereby precludes disposing of the instrument
after each surgery. It has become increasingly important
to dispose of these instruments after each surgery to
eliminate the risk of exposing the next patient to diseases
such as AIDS or hepatitis. While most surgical instruments
can be sterilized with high pressure steam, the delicate
nature of optical systems in endoscopes makes such
sterilization difficult. Also, since most of these
instruments are inherently fragile, they are frequently
broken, at great cost and inconvenience to the user.In an effort to reduce the cost and complexity of
the prior art systems, U.S. Patent No. 4,784,118 to Fantone
describes an endoscope in which the light pipe, and the
objective, relay, and viewing lens assemblies are all made
of polymeric materials, such as acrylics, polystyrenes,
polycarbonates and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN) copolymers,
by conventional injection molding techniques.Although the Fantone device offers some
advantages over prior art optical systems, the device has
several drawbacks. The polymeric relay lenses are composed
of only one material which increases the chromatic
aberration of the image and reduces the resolution. In
addition, in
