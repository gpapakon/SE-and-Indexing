<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for conveying articles on rotatably and parallel-mounted rollers (14) of a roller conveyor (11), there engages under a group consisting of a plurality of mutually adjacent rollers (14) a pressure beam (18) which extends in the conveying direction and which is movable by a piston/cylinder unit (28/30) and can be laid non-positively against the rollers (14) of the group. During a lifting movement, the pressure beam (18) is guided by at least one pair of wedge faces (22) fixed on it at an angle of inclination (w), a plurality of groups of rollers (14), each group with a pressure beam (18) engaging under it, being connected in series. In the event of a build-up in conveyance, a signal is triggered for a control, by which that pressure beam (18) is then actuated. The control is connected to an electronic monitoring device, for example a light barrier.

Device for conveying piece goods on parallel and rotatably mounted rollers of a 
roller conveyor, in which a group consisting of a plurality of adjacent rollers is 

engaged from below by a braking device which extends in the conveying direction, 
can be moved by an energy accumulator and can be applied non-positively to the 

rollers of the group, a plurality of groups (A B, C, D) of rollers (14) each with a 
braking device engaging them from below being connected in series, characterised 

in that the beam-shaped braking device (18) is guided on at least one pair of 
wedge-shaped surfaces (22) inclined thereto during a stroke. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that at least one of the groups (A, B, 
C, D) is provided with an electronic monitoring device (33), e.g. a light barrier, by 

means of which a signal for a control means can be triggered in the event of a 
build-up of goods, and the braking device (18) can be actuated by the control 

means in the event of a build-up. 
Device according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised by a piston/cylinder unit 
(28/30) as the energy accumulator which is connected to the control means and 

can be actuated by the latter in the event of a build-up. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the braking device 
(18) in the form of a compressed beam is provided, e.g. at each of its ends with at 

least one of the wedge-shaped surfaces (22) inclined towards the roller conveyor 
(10) and slidably mounted on a mating sliding surface (24) of a roller frame (11) 

carrying the rollers (14), the compressed beam being arranged so that it can be 
raised in a direction of thrust and lowered in the opposite direction by the relative 

movement of the pair of wedge-shaped surfaces (22/24). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the inclination of 
the wedge-shaped surfaces (22) is directed upwards in the direction of rotation (z) 

of the rollers (14) and/or that the piston (28) of the piston/cylinder unit (28/30) is 
inclined at an angle (t) approximately parallel to the wedge-shaped surfaces (22).  

 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the monitoring 
device (33) and a logic element are associated with each compressed beam (18) 

and its piston/cylinder unit (28/30), by means of which the piston/cylinder unit can 
be displaced in the event of a "busy" signal, the monitoring device possibly being a 

sensor. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the foremost 
group (A) of rollers (14) in the conveying direction (x) is provided with the 

monitoring device or sensor (33) and the following groups (B, C, D) are internally 
connected to the control means of the first group. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 7, with side walls, characterised in 
that side walls (12) extending in the conveying direction contain bearings for the 

rollers and the compressed beam (18) is arranged within the side wall outside the 
effective length (n) of the rollers (14). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the roller 
(14) mounted at both ends in an extruded profile (32) is rotatably arranged on a 

bearing axle (37) fixed at its ends, the extruded profile (32) of the side wall (12) 
possibly forming a receiving space (38) for the compressed beam (18) or spur 

gears (16) of the rollers together with a channel-shaped profile (40) traversed by 
the rollers (14). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the rollers 
(14) of the group (A, B, C, D) are driven by a conveyor strand (54) meshing 

positively or non-positively with the spur gears (16) of the rollers, an endless drive 
chain possibly serving as the conveyor strand (54), its upper side (54h) 

cooperating with the spur gears (16). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the endless 
conveyor strand (54) is arranged to rotate in an insert profile (52). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 11, characterised in that the insert 
profile (52) is fixed in a retaining groove (50) in an arm (48) projecting from the 

extruded profile (32).  
 
Method of conveying piece goods with a device according to at least one of claims 
1 to 12, characterised in that, in the event of a build-up of goods, each of the 

sections (A to D) is scanned in a contactless manner by a sensor (33), the signal is 
fed to a logic element and the status of the following section in the conveying 

direction is established. 
Method according to claim 13, characterised in that, if the following section is 
busy, the energy accumulator (28/30) of the braking device (18) is actuated and 

the braking device is raised, the busy signal possibly being transmitted from the 
braked section to the following section in the conveying direction (x).
