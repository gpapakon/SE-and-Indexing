<ABSTRACT>
More than one security bit (S1, S2, S3, S4) is used in a block of a PLD chip (10). The internal configuration and other information is left unprotected when all the security bits are in the erased state, and is protected by programming one or all the security bits. The security bits are located physically in proximity to the areas containing configuration and any other user-defined data (C1, C2), both so they are difficult to discover and so that the erasure of all security bits in an EPROM-based PLD would cause a large number of adjacent user-defined bits to be erased as well, hence making it very difficult to extract useful information from a protected device by reverse engineering. Situating security bits in a different, pseudorandom location within each block of the chip makes them difficult to find and so further inhibits reverse engineering.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC DEVICE HAVING SECURITY ELEMENTS LOCATED AMONGST CONFIGURATION BIT LOCATIONS TO PREVENTUNAUTHORIZED READINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to programmable logic devices (PLDs) , and more particularly to security protection of internal configuration information of PLDs. Description of the Prior Art A PLD usually includes multiple configurable logic blocks, I/O blocks and an interconnect network. Figure 1 shows one enlarged configurable logic block in a PLD device, including a programmable configuration element area A, where programmable configuration elements 11 are located in a row- column array, and an area B, where the AND array, and hence the AND programmable element array are located. A typical PLD contains several such blocks. It is to be understood that the AND array B is only an example; area B can be any other programmable logic array. The programmable configuration elements in area A control multiplexers, gates, tri-state buffers, etc. to configure the block into different internal configurations, while the AND programmable elements in area B are for programming the AND array to specify different combinatorial logic functions. In addition, programmable elements are also included in the interconnect network to determine routing between the blocks. In most cases, all these programmable elements are identical for a given PLD. They may be fuses, anti-fuses, EPROM or EEPROM elements or other programmable memory elements. Programming of a PLD is accomplished by programming each of the programmable elements. However, the most important information defining a user's chip design of the block is contained in the programmable configuration element 

array in area A because the programming of these elements 11 determines the basic circuit structure the block assumes. Normally the state pattern of these programmable elements programmed into a PLD can, like a PROM, be read and displayed by use of programming hardware to allow a user to verify his design. Therefore, if no security steps are taken, a user's design implemented by such programmed PLDs can easily be reverse-engineered (copied) since the state pattern of the programmable configuration elements programmed into a PLD determines the internal configuration, hence the operation, of the device. Therefore, a single security element configuration bit 12 as shown in Figure 1 is often provided in PLDs, and disables this read function when bit 12 is in a set state. This somewhat secures
