<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new oxazabicyclo 
derivatives having 5-HT₄ receptor agonist activity, a process 
for their preparation and 5-HT₄ receptor agonists comprising 
those derivatives as an active ingredient. The abnormality in function of a gastrointestinal 
motility by various causes such as chronic gastritis, 
gastrectomy, peptic ulcer results in the reflux of the 
gastric contents into the esophagus, delayed emptying of 
contents and the depression in the small and large 
intestinal function. This can lead to several 
gastrointestinal disorders including nausea, vomiting, 
heartburn, anorexia, abdominal distension, epigastric 
dysphoria, abdominalgia, and constipation and further reflux 
esophagitis. The diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome 
and spurious ileus is due to the depression in the 
gastrointestinal motility. The agents for the treatment of these conditions 
and diseases include direct cholinergic agent (e.g.,  
 
Aclatonium Napadisilate) or Dopamine antagonist (e.g., 
Domperidone). However, it is reported that these known 
agents have the problems in respect of pharmacological 
effects and side-effects including diarrhea and 
extrapyramidal syndrome. Trends in Pharmacological Science, Vol. 13, 141-145, 
1992 describes that the 5-HT₄ receptor exists in central 
and peripheral nervous systems and said receptor in the 
gastrointestinal nervous system participates in the release 
of acetylcholine from cholinergic nerve. Thus it is thought 
that the compounds acting on the 5-HT₄ receptor in 
alimentary canal and promoting the release of acetylcholine 
can be more effective gastroprokinetic agent with less side-effects. 
Further investigation of such compounds has been 
required. We have now found that certain class of 
oxazabicyclo derivatives act as agonists at 5-HT₄ receptors 
and have a pharmaceutical use in the treatment of the 
digestive tract diseases. Therefore, the present invention provides in one 
aspect a compound of formula (I) and pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts thereof.  wherein R is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a halo(C₁-C₆)alkyl 
group, a (C₁-C₆)alkoxy group, a nitro group, a hydroxyl 
group or an amino group, n is 1 or 2, the R groups being the 
same or different when n is 2, and Ar represents a radical of 
formula (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII) or (VIII) 
wherein
 
Ra to Re are independently a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, 
a hydroxyl group, a (C₁-C₆)alkoxy group or a (C₁-C₈)alkyl 
group;
 
R₁ is a hydrogen atom, a (C₁-C₈)alkyl group, a (C₃-C₈)alkenyl 
gro
