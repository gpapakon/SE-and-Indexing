<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an impact-resistant 
polyacetal resin composition, which comprises a first step 

of mixing with shear a polyacetal resin (A), a 
thermoplastic polyurethane (B) and a polyhydric alcohol 

(C) having at least three hydroxyl groups in the molecule 
at a temperature of 180 to 250°C and at a temperature at 

which said polyacetal resin (A) and said thermoplastic 
polyurethane (B) melt; and a second step of mixing with 

shear the resulting mixture obtained in the first step, in 
the presence of at least one compound (D) selected from 

the group consisting of a polyisocyanate (d₁) and a 
compound (d₂) which generates a polyisocyanate under heat, 

at a temperature of 180 to 250°C and at a temperature at 
which s
aid polyacetal resin (A) and said thermoplastic 
polyurethane (B) melt. The polyacetal resin composiion 

provided by the above process is useful as a material for 
such parts as clips, springs, gears, bearings, cams, 

levers and the like in electric and electronical machines, 
office machines, automobiles, industrial machines, toys 

and/or sports goods, etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
producing an impact-resistant polyacetal resin composition
which is conveniently used as a material for such parts as
clips, springs, gears, bearings, cams and levers
in electrical and electronical machines, office machines,
automobiles, industrial machines, toys and/or sports
goods.The invention also relates to a process for
producing an impact-resistant polyacetal resin composition
which can give parts having excellent adhesion of weld
portions when the parts molded by injection molding have
the weld portions.The invention is further directed to a process
for producing an impact-resistant polyacetal resin
composition which can give the above-described parts
having excellent outer appearance by means of melt
molding.The invention is further directed to a process
for producing an impact-resistant polyacetal resin
composition of which change in melt viscosity by elapse of
time is small.Polyacetal has found wide usage as an
engineering plastic excelling in mechanical properties,
electrical properties and chemical properties such as
chemical resistance. Its usages are limited, however,
because of its inferior impact resistance compared to that
of other engineering plastics. As a method to improve
impact resistance, i.e., impact strength, of polyacetal, a
means to blend a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer with
polyacetal has been proposed and has been already put to
practical use. For example, U.K. Patent 1,017,244 discloses a
thermoplastically deformable composition, which comprises
a polyurethane of high molecular weight at least 8,000 and
a polyoxymethylene of molecular weight at least 4,000, the
ratio of the polyurethane to the polyoxymethylene being
from 5:95 % by weight to 95:5 % by weight.However, a molded article obtained by melt
molding a composition comprising a polyacetal and a
thermoplastic polyurethane has substantially poor outer
appearance. The reason for this is that each of the
polymers forms an independent layer in the inside of the
molded article and on the surface thereof because of poor
compatibility between the two polymers, and these layers
are separated from each other on the surface of the molded
article.Furthermore, when a molded article molded by
injection molding has a weld portion, the adhesion of the
weld portion is not always sufficient.Under the situation described above, use of a
composition which comprises a polyacetal and a
thermoplastic polyurethane as a material for producing
parts having complex shapes formed by weld portions
