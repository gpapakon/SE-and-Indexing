<ABSTRACT>
Prodrugs, of generic formula (I), are disclosed for use in antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT). The prodrugs are substrates for carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) and yield more active cytotoxic drugs than known products of CPG2 catalysed reactions, wherein R1 and R2 each independently represents chlorine, bromine, iodine, OSO2Me, or OSO2phenyl, X represents O, NH or -CH2-; Y represents O.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to compounds for use in antibody directed
enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT), processes for their preparation,
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods for their use as
well as to a two component system comprising 1) a conjugate of an enzyme
and an antibody or antibody fragment and 2) a compound of the present
invention. The compounds are particularly of interest as pro-drugs for
use in conjunction with carboxypeptidase G enzymes, particularly
carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2).Many cytotoxic compounds have been discovered which are of
potential use in cancer chemotherapy. Nitrogen mustards form one
important family of such cytotoxic compounds. The clinical use of
cytotoxic compounds in general and nitrogen mustards in particular has
been limited because of the poor selectivity in the cytotoxic effect
between tumour cells and normal cells.One approach to overcome this problem has involved the
development of so-called pro-drugs which are derivatives of the cytotoxic
drug, often a relatively simple derivative, whose cytotoxic properties
are considerably reduced compared to those of the parent drug. Proposals
have been made for the administration of such pro-drugs to patients under
regimes whereby the pro-drug is only converted to the cytotoxic drug in
the region of the intended site of action.One approach involves linkage of a cytotoxic parent nitrogen
mustard with an amino acid to form a pro-drug which can be converted to
the parent nitrogen mustard at the site of intended action under the
influence of an enzyme. This approach can be put into practise by the
utilisation of an antibody/enzyme conjugate in association with a
pro-drug. The antibody/enzyme conjugate is formed from an antibody
selective for tumours and an enzyme that will convert the pro-drug to the
cytotoxic drug. In clinical practice, the antibody/enzyme conjugate is
first administered to the patient and is allowed to bind to the tumour.
After a suitable period of time, to allow clearance of the
antibody/enzyme conjugate from the rest of the body, the pro-drug is
administered to the patient. Conversion of the pro-drug, under the
influence of the localised enzyme, to the cytotoxic drug takes place
mainly in the region of the tumour. Such a system is described in 
International Application PCT/GB88/00181 published as W088/07378 and US
Patent No 4,975,278.Known pro-drugs for ADEPT cleaved by CPG yield benzoic acid
mustards as their active drugs. However there is a need for more active
drugs to be produced by CPG
