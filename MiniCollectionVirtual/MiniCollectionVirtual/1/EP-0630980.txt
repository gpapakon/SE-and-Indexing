<ABSTRACT>
When cold-moulded (cold-pressed) briquettes are produced from iron-containing metallurgical waste material admixed with binder, in order to achieve high mechanical strength of the briquettes and to obtain virtually complete reducibility, magnetitic metallurgical waste material such as scale (tinder) (1) is mixed with haematitic fines (5) to form a layer (10) which envelops the individual magnetitic particles (9) and consists of the haematitic fines (5), after which the binder is then admixed (Figure 1).

<CLAIMS>
A method of producing cold-moulded iron-containing briquettes from iron-containing
metallurgical waste material (1, 5) by mixing the metallurgical waste material (1,

5) with a binder (11) formed from one or several components and subsequent cold-moulding,
characterized in that magnetite metallurgical waste material such as scale (1) is mixed with

hematite fine material (5) under formation of a layer (10) consisting of the hematite fine
materials (5) and enveloping the individual magnetite particles (9) and that subsequently the

binder (11) is admixed.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that during mixing of the magnetite
metallurgical waste material (1) with hematite fine material (5) waste water is admixed.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that during mixing of the magnetite
metallurgical waste material (1) with hematite fine material (5) oil-containing waste water is

admixed.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the hematite fine
materials (5) have a grain size between 3.15 and 0.01 mm, preferably 0.5 and 0.02 mm.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that slaked lime is used
as binder (11).
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that molasses are used
as binder (11).
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that mixtures having 0.5 to 2 wt.%
slaked lime, 2 to 4 wt.% molasses, the remainder being magnetite metallurgical waste

material (1) and hematite fine materials (5), are used.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that mixtures of 30 to 90 wt.% scale
(1), 0.6 to 0.9 wt.% slaked lime, 1 to 5 wt.% molasses, and a remainder of filter dusts and/or

manufacturing-shop dusts are used. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that mixtures of about 36 wt.% scale
(1), about 57 wt.% fine material from iron ore and/or iron pellets, about 7 wt.% filter dusts

and manufacturing-shop dusts, and about 3 wt.% molasses (relative to scale + fine material +
dusts) are used.
