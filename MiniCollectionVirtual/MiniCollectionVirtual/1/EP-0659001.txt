<ABSTRACT>
Parallel digital data are transmitted along with a specific 
synchronization pattern added thereto. Each synchronization 

pattern adder (11) adds the synchronization pattern at 
an equal timing for each channel. Parallel data after the 

synchronization pattern addition, are converted in parallel-to-serial 
converters (13) into serial data which are in 

turn converted in an optical transmitter (TX) (20) into 
optical signal. On the receiving side, the optical signal 

is converted in an optical receiver (RX) (22) into an 
electric signal, from which the parallel data are restored 

in serial-to-parallel converters (14) to be inputted to 
synchronization pattern detectors (16). The synchronization 

pattern detectors (16) compare their shift register 
data and synchronization pattern and hold their synchronization 

pattern detection signal (31) to be "1" for one time 

slot if the number of non-accord bits is within one. In 
the next time slot, a controller (41) recognizes synchronization 

pattern detection when and only when all the synchronization 
pattern detection signals (31) are "1". In 

this way, reliable synchronization pattern detection can be 
made regardless of the occurrence of any transmission error 

in the synchronization pattern.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data transmission systems
used between computers or like terminals, for inter-board
connection, or for data interfaces in data transmission
systems, switching systems, etc.In many data links in which digital data packets are
transmitted between computers or boards, a specific synchronization
pattern called a "delimiter" is added to the
leading end or to both the leading and trailing ends of
each packet to realize packet synchronization. Particularly,
where the packets are variable in length, reliable
detection of the delimiter is necessary for the recognition
of the leading and trailing packet ends.As an application of an optical fiber communication to
the data link of such system, there are fiber channels (as
disclosed in, for instance, Fiber Channel Physical Layer
(FC-PH) Rev. 2.1, ANSI X3T9.3/91-071, May 25, 1991). For
parallel digital data transmission, the parallel data is
often converted through time division multiplexing into a
serial signal for transmission of the data on a reduced
number of data lines. In such data transmission systems, 
it is necessary for the receiving side to realize frame
synchronization for the serial-to-parallel conversion in
such a manner that the parallel data channels inputted on
the transmitting side and those outputted on the receiving
side are in accord with one another. To realize frame
synchronization, a specific synchronization pattern is
applied, which enables the receiving side to detect the
frame phase.In such a data link, a first problem is encountered
when a transmission error occurs in the synchronization
pattern itself which is added to data to be transmitted.
In this case, it is unable to recognize the packet or frame
phase, thus making all the data contained in the packet or
frame to be ineffective. The problem arises frequently,
because in an optical data link such as fiber channels, the
transmission line is basically not error-free. In the case
where the length of the packet or frame is fixed, it is
possible to avoid the problem considerably by adopting the
so-called "forward protection", i.e., causing a synchronization
pattern detector operation like that of a flywheel
(for instance, Kaneko, "PCM Communication Techniques", pp.
109-116, Sanpoh, 1976). Where the length of the packet or
frame is variable, however, such a method cannot be adopted.
On the contrary, there are cases where the same pattern
as the synchronization pattern is present and can be 
erroneously judged to be the synchronization pattern. To
avoid this, in the
