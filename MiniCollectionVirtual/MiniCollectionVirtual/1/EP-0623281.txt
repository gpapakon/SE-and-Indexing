<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a herbicidal 
extruded granular composition comprising an active ingredient, 

such as an imidazolinone herbicide, an inert carrier, a wetting 
agent, and a dispersing agent. Said compositions are dust free, 

storage stable, readily dispersible, and 
environmentally compatible.

<DESCRIPTION>
Herbicides are commonly formulated as 
wettable powders, dispersible granules, emulsifiable 
concentrates, aqueous flowables and the like. Of 
these, the dispersible granular formulations offer ease 
of handling, for instance spills can be readily swept 
up, and of course, the absence of an organic, flammable 
solvent. In general, such formulations offer increased 
chemical stability over liquid formulations. Further, 
granular formulations offer the ability to employ 
higher concentrations of active ingredient, i.e. 70% or 
greater vs. 15% to 45% for the average liquid formulation 
and, thereby, significantly reduce the bulk of the 
final product. The present invention relates to a herbicidal 
extruded granular composition comprising an active 
ingredient, such as an imidazolinone herbicide, an 
inert carrier, a wetting agent, and a dispersing agent. 
Said compositions are dust free, storage stable, 
readily dispersible, and environmentally compatible. The imidazolinone class of herbicides such as 
imazaquin, imazethapyr, imazamethapyr and imazamethabenz 
are highly sought after for the selective control 
of a wide breadth of grass and broadleaf weeds in the 
presence of agricultural crops at exceptionally low 
rates of application. At present, imidazolinone  
 
herbicides are commercially available mainly in the 
form of liquid compositions. However, as environmental 
concerns increase, there is an ever-growing need for an 
effective dry composition containing an imidazolinone 
herbicide. The prior art's pan granulated compositions 
present certain drawbacks such as dusting, variable 
particle size distribution, and lack of ease of water 
dispersibility. Moreover, extruded granular compositions 
can produce tightly compacted granules which are 
difficult to suspend and resuspend in water. It has now been found that extrudable granulated 
herbicidal compositions comprising an imidazolinone 
herbicide, an inert carrier, a wetting agent and 
a dispersing agent can be formulated to possess improved 
suspendability and dispersibility. The imidazolinone 
herbicide may be any of the imidazolinone compounds 
known in the art such as those described in 
United States patents 4,798,619; 4,772,311; 5,039,333; 
5,108,485; and in EP 254,951 and EP 322,616. Preferably 
the imidazolinone herbicide is selected from 
imazaquin, imazapyr, imazethapyr and imazamethapyr. A 
more preferred imidazolinone herbicide is imazaquin. 
In the compositions of the invention the imidazolinone 
herbicide may be present in the amount,
