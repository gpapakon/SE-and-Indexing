<ABSTRACT>
A pigmentary material comprises silver in a lattice of crystalline zirconia, which 
material contains at least 0.4% weight of the silver. A process for preparing a 

pigmentary material comprising silver in a lattice of crystalline zirconia comprises 
calcining a zirconium component which yields the zirconia, and a silver component 

which yields the silver, forming a calcination mixture of the resultant zirconium and 
silver moieties and cooling the mixture, the weight of fluoride compound in
 the total 
weight of the components to be calcined being less than 6%.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pigmentary material, a process for preparing 
it, a mixture for use in the process, a pigment comprising the material, a substance 
coloured by containing the pigment dispersed therein, an enamel composition 
containing the pigment and an article bearing the fired enamel composition on 
its surface. A new pigmentary material has been invented. In a particular 
embodiment, the material can be used to produce on porcelain, china, earthenware,  
 
glass and other surfaces the decorative pink and purple colour space at present 
afforded by gold-based pigments; the present material is not based on the rare 
and expensive metal gold. Accordingly, the invention provides a pigmentary material 
comprising silver in a lattice of crystalline zirconia, which material contains 
at least 0.4% by weight of the silver. The invention provides also a process for preparing this material, 
which process comprises calcining a zirconium component which yields the 
zirconia, and a silver component which yields the silver, forming a calcination 
mixture of the resultant zirconium and silver moieties and cooling the mixture. The invention provides also a process for preparing a pigmentary 
material comprising silver in a lattice of crystalline zirconia, which process 
comprises calcining a zirconium component which yields the zirconia, and a silver 
component which yields the silver, forming a calcination mixture of the resultant 
zirconium and silver moieties and cooling the mixture, the weight of fluoride 
compound in the total weight of the components to be calcined being less than 
6%. The invention provides also a process for preparing a pigmentary 
material comprising silver in a lattice of crystalline zirconia, which process 
comprises calcining a mixture of a zirconium component which yields the zirconia,  
 
and a silver component which yields the silver, the mixture containing less 
than 6% by weight of fluoride compound, and cooling the mixture. The invention provides also a mixture for use in the process, 
comprising a homogeneous mixture of particles of the zirconium component and 
particles of the silver component. The invention also provides a pigment comprising the pigmentary 
material. The invention provides also a substance coloured by containing the 
pigment dispersed therein. The invention also provides an enamel composition comprising a frit 
and the pigment. The invention provides also an article bearing on its surface the 
enamel composition which has been fired thereon. US
