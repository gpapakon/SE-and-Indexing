<ABSTRACT>
The invention comprises a topsheet for use in body fluid 
absorptive articles and, method and apparatus for making the 

same so improved that collapse and clogging of liquid 
passages may be reliably avoided. 
To this end, the topsheet (2) comprises an upper sheet (7) 
provided with a skin-contacting area (14) and liquid 

passages (13) and a lower-sheet (8) provided with a skin-non-contacting 
area (15), an area (16) welded to the liquid passages 

(13) and an exposed area (25). The area (25) is welded to each of 
the liquid passages (13) around its lower opening (12) so as to 

protect this liquid passage (13) against collapse and clogging. 
The exposed area (25) defines a skin-contacting surface (18) 

which rises up into each of the liquid passages (13) but not 
beyond the upper surface of the skin-contacting area (14). The 

upper sheet (7) cooperates with the lower sheet (8) to define 
cavities (20) extending in the direction of the topsheet's 

thickness. 
The topsheet (2) can bemade by blowing molten fibres from 
a melt blow extruder used to form the lower 

sheet against the lower side of the upper sheet formed by a 
melt blow extruder used to form the upper sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid-permeable 
topsheet for use in disposable body fluid absorptive articles 
such as sanitary napkins, disposable diapers and training 
pants and, a method and an apparatus for making the same. Concerning liquid-permeable topsheets used for body 
fluid absorptive articles, a technique is well known to make 
the topsheet from plastic film or nonwoven fabric, to provide 
the topsheet with liquid passages each extending therethrough 
from top to bottom thereof, the upper surface of the sheet 
being adapted to be in contact with the wearer's skin, and to 
arrange lower openings of the respective liquid passages so 
as to be in contact with an absorbent core so that a capillary 
action occurring within each liquid passage may be utilized 
to transfer excreted body fluids toward the- absorbent core. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 1982-17081 
discloses a technique according to which a topsheet made of 
polyethylene film is provided with conically tapered 
capillaries and lower ends of the respective capillaries are  
 
arranged so as to be closely in contact with an absorbent 
core. According to a technique disclosed by Japanese patent 
application Disclosure No. 1985-259261, a topsheet made of 
plastic film is provided with cylindrical liquid passages 
with their lower ends extending into an absorbent core. Such 
cylindrical liquid passages are more stable and therefore 
less deformable than conical liquid passages under a large 
load in the axial direction. Japanese patent application Disclosure No. 1992-152945 
discloses a technique according to which there is provided a 
high density area or rib continuously surrounding lower 
openings of respective liquid passages. This technique 
certainly stabilizes an opening of each liquid passage 
against the deformation as well as the collapse and allows 
the body fluids to be effectively transferred toward an 
absorbent core. US Patent No. 4,741,941 discloses a method for making a 
topsheet provided with liquid passages utilizing the 
manufacturing process for melt blown nonwoven fabric or span 
bond nonwoven fabric. It is also proposed by this Disclosure 
that woody pulp is fed onto the lower side of the topsheet and 
a combination thus integrated is used for absorptive  
 
articles. Japanese patent application Disclosure No. 1981-11058 
discloses a technique according to which an upper sheet made 
of hydrophobic material is integrally combined with a lower 
sheet made of hydrophilic material so that the lower
