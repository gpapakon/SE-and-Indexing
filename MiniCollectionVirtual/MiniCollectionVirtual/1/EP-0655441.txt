<ABSTRACT>
(4-Cyclopropyl-6-methylpyrimidin-2-yl)phenylamine in its crystal modification B and high eutectic purity (at least 98%) with a melting point of between 73 DEG C and 75 DEG C does not have a tendency to crystallise as a fungicidal active compound in crop protection products, which is in contrast to the known modification A. Such compositions are highly storage-stable and retain their original, good suspendability and dispersibility.
