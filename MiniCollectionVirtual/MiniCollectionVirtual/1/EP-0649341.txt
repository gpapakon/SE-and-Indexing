<ABSTRACT>
The present invention makes use of a single detector to monitor several process functions, e.g. reaction efficiency, reagent flow rates, the presence of empty reagent reservoirs, the absence of a chemical reactor column in the system, blockage of flow system, etc., at a single location in the flow system. In accordance with the detection scheme of the present invention, only one detector is required to accomplish the same, if not more, functions as many detectors in the prior art instruments. In the described embodiment, an optical detector is positioned downstream of a chemical reaction chamber. This detector monitors the effluent from the reaction chamber to monitor the reaction efficiency. It also monitors the system functions upstream of the reaction chamber. System flow rate is monitored by detecting the presence of a gas bubble which has been introduced into the system at a known instance. Depletion of reagents in the reservoirs can be detected by monitoring the absence of the reagents at the detector at times when the reagents are expected. The flow system may be periodically diagnosed to check for flow blockage or missing flow component, by monitoring the flow past the detector which corresponds to a predetermined succession of reagents introduced into the system. Any deviation from a predictable succession of changes in the flow monitored by the detector indicates possible blockage of the flow delivery system or missing flow components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automated 
chemical processes, and more particularly, to monitoring 
of process efficiency as affected by reagent flow and 
reaction. Automated chemical processors for processes 
such as DNA (nucleic acid) synthesis, peptide synthesis 
and peptide sequencing generally require a system of 
valves and interconnecting tubings to deliver a 
predetermined series of chemicals to a reactor in which a 
desired series of chemical reactions take place. The 
chemistries of these processes are well known. DNA 
synthesis, for example, is described generally in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,458,066 issued to Caruthers et al, entitled 
"Process for Preparing Polynucleotides", which is 
incorporated by reference herein. This process involves 
the linking of nucleotides, which are the basic building 
blocks for DNA, to construct a single-stranded 
oligonucleotide. One of several approaches in 
synthesizing DNA is the so-called solid-phase 
phosphoramidite method which generally involves the steps 
of deblocking, activation, coupling, capping and 
oxidation in each synthesis cycle to add a nucleotide to 
a strand anchored to a solid-phase support. In an 
automated DNA synthesis apparatus, typically a delivery 
system dispenses a number of chemical reagents in  
 
predetermined sequence in a cycle into a reaction column 
according to instructions from the system controller or 
computer. After the desired number of cycles are 
completed, the operator removes the reaction column from 
the automated system and performs additional chemical 
procedures to retrieve the synthesized DNA fragment from 
the reaction column. In executing the automated steps, a 
variety of undesirable conditions may arise which lead to 
reduced efficiency or premature termination of the 
desired chemical reactions. For example, one undesirable 
condition is deterioration of one or more sensitive 
chemicals such that they no longer react efficiently. 
Other conditions include partial blockage of delivery 
tubing such that the desired chemical reagents are 
delivered at a reduced rate, and the depletion of 
chemical reagent in a particular reagent reservoir. It is desirable to detect the above-mentioned 
conditions when they occur and to stop the process so 
that the conditions may be corrected before proceeding 
further. In the past, operators of automated DNA 
synthesis apparatus have engaged in the practice of 
observing the effluent from the chemical reactor to 
ascertain that the reaction is proceeding efficiently and 
that
