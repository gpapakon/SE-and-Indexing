<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a kite of the type comprising a principal supporting structure with longitudinal (10, 12, 13) and transverse (11, 11') strips and a secondary supporting structure comprising strips (2) known as "whiskers" ("wiskers"). According to the invention, these strips (2) are extended in order to meet at a junction point (22) located in the median plane of symmetry. According to a first embodiment, elastic or non-elastic strings (23, 24) place these strips (2) under tension. According to a second embodiment, a supplementary piece of fabric forming a rudder is provided, this piece of fabric being stretched between the median longitudinal strip (10) and the junction point (22).

<CLAIMS>
Kite (1) of the type comprising at least one cloth section (15) and a 
main strut consisting of longitudinal and transverse rods (10, 11, 11', 12, 13) 

tensioning this cloth (15), and a secondary strut comprising additional rods (2) 
designed to tension the trailing edge of the cloth (15) or giving it contour, the kite (1) 

having a mid-plane of symmetry (P); characterized in that the said additional rods (2) 
bear on each other on a structure (23 to 25, 3) at a junction point (22) situated in the 

centre plane of symmetry (P), at a distance from the transverse rods (11, 11'). 
Kite (1) as per claim 1, characterized in that the said structure 
comprises at least one link (23, 24, 25) of which one end is fixed to at least one rod 

(10) of the main structure and the other end to the said junction point (22). 
Kite (1) as per claim 2, characterized in that the tension of the said 
structure is adjusted by acting on the tension of each link (23, 24). 
Kite (1) as per either of claims 2 or 3, characterized in that as the kite 
(1) is subject to variations in wind intensity, the links or secondary strutting are of 

flexible material to maintain constant tension despite deformation of the struts due to 
the said variations in wind strength. 
Kite (1) as per one of claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the relative 
lengths of the said links are adjusted to set the additional rods (2) at an angle towards 

the front or the back of the kite (1), the junction point (22) remaining within the mid-plane 
of symmetry (P). 
Kite (1) as per claim 1, characterized in that the said structure 
comprises an additional cloth section (4) forming a keel situated in the mid-plane of 

symmetry (P) such as to stabilize the kite (1).  
 
Kite (1) as per claim 6, characterized in that the said additional cloth 
section (4) is of porous material. 
Kite (1) as per claim 6, characterized in that the additional cloth section 
(4) has slots forming a grille. 
Kite (1) as per one of claims 6 to 8, characterized in that the said 
structure comprises a means (3) of making rigid the leading edge of the additional 

cloth section (4) to move back the centre of gravity of the main flight structure of the 
keel. 
Kite (1) as per claim 9, characterized in that the said means used to 
make rigid the leading edge consist of a rod (3), one end of which bears on the 

longitudinal bar (10) that falls within the said mid-plane of symmetry (P).
