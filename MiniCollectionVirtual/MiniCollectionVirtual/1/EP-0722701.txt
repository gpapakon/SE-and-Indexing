<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a Y-shaped stent, in particular 
one which is used to reinforce the bifurcation of the 

aorta into the arteries leading to the lower limbs 
respectively, to replace a bifurcation prosthesis 

implanted during conventional surgery.
 

This Y-shaped stent comprises a first stent arranged 
inside the aorta at the level of the bifurcation and at 

least two cylindrical stents, each of which is placed 
with a first section inside an artery branching off and 

with the remaining section inside the lumen of the first 
stent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a Y-shaped stent, in 
particular one which is used to reinforce the bifurcation 
of the aorta into the arteries leading to the lower limbs 
respectively, and a method for positioning such a stent. Such a stent can be employed in an advantageous 
manner to reinforce the bifurcation of the aorta into the 
two smaller arteries leading to the lower limbs. With the 
present state of technology such a stent is not available 
and, in the case of a lesion, it is necessary to replace 
the entire section of the blood vessel by a new, 
artificial blood vessel section (the bifurcation 
prosthesis). The surgery involved, lasting several hours, 
entails a high degree of risk and is a great burden to 
the patient. The stent according to the invention, which 
makes this operation superfluous, is characterised by a 
first stent placed inside the aorta at the level of the 
bifurcation and at least two cylindrical stents, each of 
which is placed with a first section in an artery 
branching off, and with the remaining section inside the 
lumen of the first stent. Preferred embodiments of this stent are 
characterised in claims 2-4 inclusive. Of the Y-shaped stent according to the 
invention, the first stent is fixed securely in the 
artery which divides into two branches; the cylindrical 
stents positioned both inside this first stent and inside 
the arteries branching off, are fixed in a reliable and 
sealing manner in the first stent on the one side and in 
the artery concerned on the other. In particular when stents are used which are 
known from EP-A-0 521 573 and EP-A-0 617 930, both in the  
 
name of the Applicant, a reliable and sealed anchoring is 
obtained as a result of the specific configuration of 
this stent known as such, which adapts properly and in a 
sealing manner to the wall against which it is 
positioned. The exclusive right applied for also 
encompasses a method for forming such a stent as 
characterised in claims 5-7 inclusive. The invention will be explained in greater 
detail with reference to the attached drawings. Figure 1 illustrates schematically the aorta 
and the arteries branching off to the lower limbs. Figure 2 shows how, according to the invention, 
a first stent has been placed inside the aorta. Figure 3 shows how, using the techniques and 
stent known from EP-A-0 521 573 and EP-A-0 617 930, a 
cylindrical stent, still in the unexpanded state, has 
been arranged inside the first stent and each of the two 
arteries branching off. Figure 4 shows the complete

<CLAIMS>
Y-shaped stent, particularly used for the purpose of 
reinforcing the bifurcation of the aorta into the 

arteries leading to the lower limbs respectively, 
characterised by a first stent arranged inside the aorta 

at the level of the bifurcation and at least two 
cylindrical stents, each of which is positioned with a 

first section inside an artery branching off and with the 
remaining section inside the lumen of the first stent. 
Stent as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the first stent has a cone-shaped lumen of which the end 

with the largest diameter is directed away from the 
bifurcation. 
Stent as characterised in claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the section of each cylindrical 

stent positioned inside the first stent, extends beyond 
the final edge with the largest diameter of this stent. 
Stent as characterised in claims 1-3 inclusive, 
characterised in that the outside surface of the first 

stent is also cone-shaped. 
Method for forming a Y-shaped stent inside the aorta 
and the arteries branching off and leading to the lower 

limbs respectively, comprising the following steps: 
   positioning a first, expandable stent by means of a 

positioning balloon inside the aorta above the 
bifurcation, and 

   positioning an expandable cylindrical stent in each 
of the arteries branching off at the bifurcation by means 

of a positioning balloon in such a way that this stent is 
positioned partially inside the artery branching off and 

partially extends into the lumen of the first stent. 
Method as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that 
a stent with a cone-shaped lumen is employed by way of 

the first stent and that this stent is positioned in such 
 

a way that the end with the largest diameter is directed 
away from the bifurcation. 
Method as claimed in claims 5-6 inclusive, 
characterised in that both cylindrical stents are 

positioned in such a way that the section positioned 
inside the lumen of the first stent extends beyond the 

edge with the largest diameter.
