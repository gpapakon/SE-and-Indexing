<ABSTRACT>
Tension matrix (1) and tightening device (2) are equipped with means of attachment (3, 4, 5) capable of making them integral with one another in a reversible manner. These means may be protruding laminar member (5) that can be slid, which is inserted in groove (3) located on one face of casing (6) of tension matrix (1) and one member with a hook (4) with flat part that engages against the flat surface (6a) of the opposing face of casing (6). The above-mentioned means may be comprised of: shaped groove (40) located on the outer surface of one part (41a) attached to casing (41) of tension matrix (101) and flexible fork (39) ending at each of its two ends with protruding part (39a, 39b) capable of being connected in an integral manner in a reversible way with above-mentioned shaped groove (40) of casing (41) of tension matrix (101) when fork (42) itself is inflected to a pre-determined extent. It is possible to apply the tension matrix and to tighten the relative matrix merely by using the hand that is holding the tightening device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dental matrix tensioner
according to the introduction of claim 1. Such a device is
known from US-A-4 396 374. This device is conceived to be
placed also at the inner side of the row of teeth and is
thus compact relative to the then known prior art. However,
the connection between the handle and the matrix tightener
is relatively simple, e.g. like a cloven hoof and thus not
secure. Furthermore, this device does not mention the
possibility, resp. advantage to disengage the matrix
tightener after fixing the matrix and to leave the matrix
tightener without the tensioning appliance in the mouth of
the patient during operation and to engage again the matrix
tightener for unwinding and remove the matrix band.Based on this prior art, it is the object of the invention
to provide a matrix tensioner with which it is easy to
tension a matrix band around a tooth and which is easily
engageable and disengageable for leaving the matrix
tightener with the tensioned matrix band alone in the mouth
of the patient. This object is attained with the device
defined in independent claim 1.Further advantageous aspects of the invention are defined in
the dependent claims.A detailed description of the functioning of the matrix
tensioner, working as a unit, according to the invention
with the aid of preferred embodiments will now follow, with
reference being made to the attached drawings:
Figure 1represents an enlarged partially sectioned view
of an embodiment of the matrix tightener in the
unit according to the invention; Figure 2represents one of its cross-sections; Figure 3 represents the enlarged lateral view of only the
pin of the above-mentioned matrix tightener, in
which the teeth of the toothed member applied to
one of its ends have not been drawn; Figure 4 represents the enlarged view from above of a
preferred embodiment of the above-mentioned
toothed member;Figure 5represents the longitudinal section of an
embodiment of the tensioning appliance at the
moment at which it is joined to the matrix
tightener;Figure 6represents a detailed view from which it is
possible to deduce the position of the small
connecting rod with two winches at that moment
which contributes to effecting the blocking of
the casing onto the tensioning appliance in
Figure 5;Figure 7represents the longitudinal section of the
tensioning appliance connected to the matrix
tightener, thereby constituting the unit
according to the invention;Figure 8represents a detailed view with the position of

<CLAIMS>
A dental matrix tensioner, comprising a matrix
tightener (1, 101) with a casing (6; 41) containing a pin

(7; 44) rotatable relative to the casing, the pin having a
slot therein for releasably receiving a dental matrix and

for tightening the matrix about a tooth upon rotation of the
pin relative to the casing, and a tensioning appliance (2,

102) comprising means (9, 10; 42, 48) to rotate the pin relative to
the casing, the tensioning appliance being connectable to

the matrix tightener (1, 101), characterized in that said tensioning
appliance (2, 102) further comprises an elongated assembly (17; 47)

and means (5, 12; 42, 53) movable lengthwise of and relative
to the elongated assembly (17; 47) in one direction to grip

the casing (6; 41) and in an opposite direction lengthwise
of and relative to the elongated assembly to release the

casing (6; 41), thereby selectively and releasably retaining
the rotating means (9, 10; 42, 48) in assembled relation

with the matrix tightener (1, 101), the lengthwise movable
means (5, 12; 42, 53) being connected to the rotating means (9, 10; 42, 48).
A matrix tensioner as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the lengthwise movable means (5, 12;

42, 53) has a portion (12; 53) that is rotatable and
connected to the rotating means (9, 10; 42, 48) which is

selectively engageable with the pin (7, 44) to rotate the
pin upon rotation of the portion (12; 53) of the movable means.
A matrix tensioner as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the rotating means (9, 10) comprises a

toothed pinion (9) which meshes with a toothed wheel (8a)
meshing with a toothed wheel (7c) at the pinion (7).
A matrix tensioner as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the lengthwise movable means (42, 53) 

has a shaped section (48) which fits removably in a cavity
(44a) in the pin (44).
A matrix tensioner as claimed in claim 4,
characterized in that it comprises further movable means

(45) movable lengthwise relative to the first-mentioned
movable means (42) into and out of contact with the bottom

of the cavity (44a) in the pin (44) to assist in dislodging
the shaped section (48) from the pin (44).
A matrix tensioner as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the lengthwise movable means is a

flexible cable (42) and the further movable means is a wire
(45) slidable lengthwise within the cable.
A matrix tensioner as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the lengthwise movable means (5)

comprises a pair of gripper members (4a, 5a) movable toward

and away from each other respectively to grasp and release
the casing (6).
A matrix tensioner as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the lengthwise movable means (42)

comprises a pair of fork members (39a, 39b) movable toward
and away from each other respectively to grasp and release

the casing (41) and means (43) at the elongated assembly
(47) to move the fork members toward and away from each

other upon the lengthwise movement.
A matrix tensioner as claimed in claim 8,
characterized in that the fork members (39a, 39b) are
