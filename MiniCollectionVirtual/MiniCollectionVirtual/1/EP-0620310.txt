<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for spreading a 
rectangular cloth which spreads a rectangular cloth such as 
sheets from a hung condition. A conventional apparatus for prealignment of sheets for laundry 
mangles using opposed sets of belts and laterally moved clamps is 
described in US patent specification 3,568,342. A suction box 
feeder for a flat work ironer with feeding and smoothing 
apparatus is known from US patent specification 3,414,997. 
Another spreader for flattening laundry before feeding into 
ironing rollers is explained in US patent specification 3,735,512 
while another apparatus for spreading fabrics before ironing is 
known from US patent specification 1,912,466. A conventional apparatus forming the starting construction for 
the present invention in which a rectangular cloth is pulled to 
spread one side thereof while one edge is gripped is disclosed in 
US patent specification 5,179,795. This apparatus will be 
described with reference to Figs. 28 to 33. The conventional spreading apparatus shown in Figs. 28 to 32 
spreads, for example, a rectangular cloth Y, such as a sheet, as 
shown in Fig. 33. The apparatus basically comprises a rectangular 
parallelopiped frame 1 which is formed by assembling frame 
members longitudinally, laterally, and vertically and has a 
considerable length in the longitudinal direction (considerably 
longer than the total length of the longer side of the rectangular 
cloth Y to be handled); a moving member 2 which moves 
longitudinally with respect to the frame 1 at a position over the 
frame 1; cloth corner holding means 22 and cloth edge holding 
means 23 which are located at two positions on the moving member 
2 with a predetermined space  
 
therebetween horizontally and laterally and detachably hold one 
corner C1 and part Ya' of the edge Ya adjoining the corner, 
respectively; a moving member driving unit 3 which moves the 
moving member 2 in the range from the cloth holding position P 
at the front of the frame 1 to the cloth drawing position Q at 
the rear of the frame 1; a mounting stand 4 which is installed 
on the frame 1 and supports the rectangular cloth Y, which is 
drawn to the rear of the frame 1, from the below; a conveyor 5 
constituting part of the mounting stand 4; a conveyor driving 
unit 6 for running the conveyor 5 in the normal and reverse 
directions; a side edge detector 71 for detecting the 
edge-aligning side edge Yb of the rectangular cloth Y; an end 
edge detector 72 for detecting the end edge Yc of the 
rectang
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for spreading rectangular cloth, in which a 
cloth (15) is hung naturally by gripping its corner (C1) and one 

place on the side (Ya) including the corner (C1) by a movable 
gripping device (16) which is provided with two clips (17), 

pulled horizontally on the upper surface of a mounting stand (35) 
by the gripping device while contacting with a convex front edge 

(36) of said mounting stand, and drawn onto the mounting stand, 
comprising
