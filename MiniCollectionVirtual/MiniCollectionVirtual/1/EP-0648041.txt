<ABSTRACT>
An original figure corresponding to a contracted white 
separation figure is extracted as an objective figure (step 

T2), and original figures adjacent to the objective figure 
are then extracted (step T3). When a white separation 

figure corresponding to a contiguous figure is a contracted 
type or a expanded type, a white separation figure corresponding 

to the objective figure is modified by computing a logical 
sum of the objective figure and the contiguous figure (step 

T5), executing the choking process (step T6), and executing 
the subsequent logical operations (steps T7 and T8). When a 

white separation figure corresponding to a contiguous figure 
is a clipped type or has a shape identical with that of the 

contiguous figure, the white separation figure corresponding 
to the objective figure is modified by generating an extended 

figure (step T9 or T11) and adding the slip-in figure to the 
white separation figure corresponding to the objective figure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of processing graphic data to modify a base
separation figure such as a white separation figure, which
is often used as a background image area in a prepress
process.Soft wrapping materials such as vinyl or cellophane
sheets are used for packages, on which color figures and
characters are printed. In ordinary printing process using
a white printing paper, the density of each halftone image
for each color ink is adjusted to reproduce desired colors
on a white paper sheet. In the case of the printing on a
soft wrapping material, especially on a transparent material,
a desired color is not reproduced according to the same
method as the printing on a white paper sheet. In order to
reproduce a desired color on a soft wrapping material,
specific areas corresponding to the color figures and characters
to be printed are first painted with white ink, and color
inks are then applied on the white-painted areas. These
areas to be painted with white ink are referred to as white
separation figures. There are three different types of white separation
figures as shown in Figs. 20(A) through 20(C): a contracted
white separation figure shown in Fig. 20(A), an expanded
white separation figure shown in Fig. 20(B), and a clipped
white separation figure shown in Fig. 20(C). Graphics and
characters which are to be printed on the white separation
figures are hereinafter referred to as original figures in
the specification.A contracted white separation figure is generated by
thinning an original figure by a predetermined width. An
outline of the contracted white separation figure, which is
actually hidden under the original figure is illustrated by
broken lines in Fig. 20(A). The contracted white separation
figure effectively prevents white lines from being observed
around the original figure when a soft wrapping material
expands or shrinks to cause misalignment of printing plates.An expanded white separation figure is generated by
spreading an original figure by a predetermined width (see
Fig. 20(B)). Expanded white separation figures are generally
created according to various design requirements in printing.A clipped white separation figure is created when two
original figures are in contact with each other (see Fig.
20(C)). The clipped white separation figure is generated by
spreading one of the two original figures (a figure representing
a letter 'H' in the example of Fig. 20(C)) by a predetermined
width and cutting the other original figure along a new
outline of the clipped white

A method of modifying a base separation figure to
be painted with specific base color ink, said method

comprising the steps of:

(a) providing original figure data representing a
plurality of original figures (OF1, OF2, OF3, OF4, OF5) and

base separation figure data representing a plurality of
base separation figures (WFI, WF2, WF3, WF4, WFT5)

corresponding to said plurality of original figures (OF1,
OF2, OF3, OF4, OF5), each base separation figure

representing an area laid under the corresponding original
figure and being produced by at least one of contraction

process and expansion process of a corresponding original
figure; characterized by
(b) obtaining a logical sum of a first original figure
(OFI, OF2, OF3) and a second original figure (OF1, OF2,

OF3) to produce a first intermediate figure (G1, G6), said
first original figure and said second original figure being

one of said plurality of original figures;
(c) contracting said first intermediate figure (G1,
G6) by a predetermined width (Ws) to produce a second

intermediate figure (G2, G7);
(d) obtaining a logical operation of said second
intermediate figure (G2, G7), a first base separation

figure (WF1, WF2, WF3) and a second base separation figure
(WF1, WF2, WF3) to produce a modified base separation

figure (WFla, WFlb, WF1c, WFld) including a connecting

separation figure (WF1, WF2, WF3) and said second base
