<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for dimensioning 
cordless telephony systems, in which a number of 

calculation parameters such as geographic division of the 
coverage area into rectangles, the relationship of the 

rectangles to any neighbours, determination of types of 
environment such as, for example, offices, store rooms, 

industrial premises, etc., and coverage area for a base 
unit, is extracted. These parameters are then used in an 

algorithm which enables a computer-supported capacity 
analysis with respect to the number of base units in the 

system to be carried out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
dimensioning cordless telephony systems. The invention 
essentially consists of collecting and processing data in 
order to determine the required number of base units when 
planning new cordless telephony systems in primarily 
indoor environments or corresponding environments. The 
data calculation allows a layman, by following the 
method, to calculate the optimum number of base units for 
the relevant telephony installation. The invention 
consists partly of the structuring which is carried out 
for describing the installation and partly of the 
algorithms which are used for calculating the number of 
base units needed. Methods for cell planning and calculating a grade 
of service in communication systems are already known, 
for example from the following documents: "Cochannel Interference Considerations in Frequency 
Reuse Small-Coverage-Area Radio Systems", IEEE 
Transactions on Communications, vol. COM-30; No. 1, 
January 1982, pages 135-42 compares radio systems which 
respectively utilize hexagonal or square coverage areas. 
The document deals, inter alia, with the 
signal/interference ratio, and algorithms are set up for 
calculating S/I for the two systems. The document also 
discusses other characteristics of the two systems such 
as, for example, "service probability". "Cell Planning in Manhattan Environments", 
Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference, IEEE 
New York, USA, vol. 1, pages 435-8 relates to cell 
planning in an environment consisting of buildings which 
are called "Manhattan model" in the document. This model 
is based on the assumption that the radio environment 
consists of square houses which are placed in straight  
 
rows. It is pointed out in the document that in such an 
environment it is possible to reuse accessible channels 
in a more effective way than with the normal cell 
structure. "Propagation Models", IEE Transactions on 
Vehicular Technology, vol. 37, No. 1, February 1988, 
pages 20-5, shows a compilation of some common radio 
propagation models which can be used in a radio system. "Products and services for cell planning" 
Ericsson Review, No. 2, 1990, pages 84-91 describes a 
cell planning system which is provided by Ericsson Radio 
System. The document describes a computer-based system 
and the input parameters required by any given user. American Patent No. 4 771 448 relates to a 
cellular mobile telephone system which can be installed 
without requiring to plan the placement of the base 
units. Since

<CLAIMS>
Method for dimensioning cordless telephony 
systems in an area with known structure with respect to 

geographic division and radio environment, characterized 
by the steps: 

   that the area is divided into rectangles; 
   that each rectangle is described by specifying 

the proportion of a respective type of environment; 
   that the number of base units per rectangle is 

calculated with the aid of the description of each 
rectangle with regard to the type of environment and with 

knowledge of the range of each base unit within the 
respective type of environment; 

   that the number of base units per rectangle is 
added together over all the rectangles; and 

   that the number of base units per rectangle is 
analysed with regard to the traffic demand. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that 

   for each rectangle, the rectangle which has the 
greatest common sectional length and any overhead 

rectangles are specified; and 
   that the number of base units per rectangle is 

corrected in dependence on any rectangles which are 
underneath and neighbouring. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that each rectangle is defined by scalar specification of 

the two side dimensions and by specification of the 
greatest common sectional length for each neighbouring 

rectangle. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the number of base units per rectangle which 

overlaps a rectangle on the nearest level underneath is 
reduced by the product of level penetration factor times 

the number of base units for the overlapped rectangle 
times the ratio between the overlapping area and the 

total area of the overlapping rectangle. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the number of base units per rectangle which has a 

 
neighbouring rectangle, if this number is less than 1 and 

if the quotient between the sectional length and the mean 
side length of the rectangle is less than a neighbour 

criterion, is rounded off to 1. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the number of base units per rectangle which lacks 

neighbours is to be rounded off upwards to a whole 
number. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the number of types of environment 

is seven, with the following classification: 

a. structually light office 
b. structurally heavy office 
c. open indoor area with ceiling height lower than 
4 m 
d. open indoor area with ceiling height higher than 
4 m 
e. store room/industrial premises with racks or 
machines higher than 75% of the ceiling height 
f. store room/industrial premises with racks or 
machines lower than 75% of the ceiling height 
g. outdoor area. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that system-dependent parameters are 

stored in advance. 
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the following system-dependent parameters are 

included: 
   neighbour criterion, level penetration factor, 

ranges of the base unit in different types of 
environment, maximum traffic per base unit in different 

types of environment.
