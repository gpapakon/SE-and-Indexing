<ABSTRACT>
This invention comprises a catalyst system and a process using such catalyst system for the production of high molecular weight polyolefins, particularly polyethylene and higher poly- alpha -olefin, and copolymers of ethylene and/or  alpha -olefins with other unsaturated monomers, including diolefins, acetylenically unsaturated monomers and cyclic olefins. The catalyst system comprises three components, a monocyclopentadienyl Group IV B transition metal compound, an alumoxane, and a modifier. The catalyst system is highly active, at low ratios of aluminum to the Group IV B transition metal, hence catalyzes the production of a polyolefin product containing low levels of catalyst metal residue.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to unsupported systems, and to a process using such catalyst
systems for the production of high molecular weight polymers, particularly polyolefins. The catalyst systems comprise
a monocyclopentadienyl transition metal compound, an alumoxane, and a modifier. The catalyst system is highly active,
at low ratios of aluminum to the transition metal, hence catalyzes the production of a polyolefin product containing low
levels of catalyst metal residue.As is well known, various processes and catalysts exist for the homopolymerization or copolymerization of olefins.
For many applications it is of primary importance for a polyolefin to have a high weight average molecular weight while
having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. A high weight average molecular weight, when accompanied
by a narrow molecular weight distribution, provides a polyolefin or an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer with high strength
properties.Traditional Ziegler-Natta catalyst systems -- a transition metal compound cocatalyzed by an aluminum alkyl -- are
capable of producing polyolefins having a high molecular weight but the polyolefins produced thereby are generally of
a broad molecular weight distribution.More recently a catalyst system has been developed wherein the transition metal compound has two or more
cyclopentadienyl ring ligands -- such transition metal compound being referred to as a metallocene -- which catalyzes
the production of olefin monomers to polyolefins. Accordingly, metallocene compounds of a Group IV B metal, particularly,
titanocenes and zirconocenes, have been utilized as the transition metal component in such "metallocene"
containing catalyst system for the production of polyolefins and ethylene-α-olefin copolymers. When such metallocenes
are cocatalyzed with an aluminum alkyl -- as is the case with a traditional type Ziegler-Natta catalyst system -- the
catalytic activity of such metallocene catalyst system is generally too low to be of any commercial interest.It has since become known that such metallocenes may be cocatalyzed with an alumoxane -- rather than an
aluminum alkyl -- to provide a metallocene catalyst system of high activity for the production of polyolefins. A metallocene-alumoxane
catalyst system generally produces polyolefins of a narrow molecular weight distribution.The zirconium metallocene species, as cocatalyzed or activated with an alumoxane, are commonly more active
than their hafnium or titanium analogous for the polymerization of ethylene alone or together
