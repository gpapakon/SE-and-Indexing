<ABSTRACT>
A surgical cable assembly (10) with a leader (11) is 
disclosed for guiding surgical cables (14, 16) in medical 

procedures. Leader (11) includes a stem (18) with two or 
more arms (20, 22) extending from stem (18). Surgical 

cables (14, 16) are attached to arms (20, 22) so that 
when stem (18) is passed through a selected region 

surgical cables (14, 16) attached to the arms will be 
passed through the selected region as well. End 

terminations (28, 30, 32) for surgical cables (12, 14, 
16) are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgically implanted wires 
and cables and more particularly relates to improved 
methods and apparatus for use in surgically installing 
wires and cables at selected locations in a patient's 
body.  Surgical wires and cables are used in a variety of 
surgical procedures, for example, reconstructive spine 
surgery such as fusions, spine trauma surgery, total hip 
arthroplasty, fracture fixation, open heart surgery for 
closures of the sternum, oral and facial surgery to fix 
mandibular fractures and the like, and other surgical 
procedures. Often, surgical cables and wires are used to 
encircle or loop about bones to hold them together for 
healing or fusion in some types of spinal surgery. For 
purposes of this application, "cable" includes 
monofilament and single strand wire along with 
multifilament and multistrand surgical cable and wire 
ropes. For some surgical procedures it is desirable to pass 
two surgical cables under the lamina (sublamina) of one 
or more vertebrae. Once the surgical cables are passed 
under the lamina of a vertebra, the surgical cable is 
frequently pulled through and then secured in a loop 
about the vertebra. This latter procedure may be done, 
for example, to allow the vertebra to fuse. In 
performing this type of procedure, it is preferable to 
pass surgical cables or objects through the sublamina 
region a minimum number of times. One method of passing two surgical cables while only 
guiding one item through the sublamina region has been to 
connect two surgical cables with a monofilament member. 
Prior to inserting in the sublamina region, the 
monofilament member is bent to form a V-configuration 
with the surgical cables extending from the ends of the 
monofilament member. The monofilament member is then 
passed through the sublamina region to position the 
desired portion of the surgical cables relative to the 
lamina. The monofilament member is then cut resulting in 
two separate surgical cables under the lamina. This previously known method has some disadvantages. 
First, bending the single monofilament member to form a 
V-configuration means that the portion of the  
 
monofilament member that leads the surgical cables under 
the lamina is twice the width of the monofilament member. 
The double width of the bent monofilament member may make 
it difficult to guide at times. Additionally, bending 
the monofilament member so that both surgical cables are 
at the same level or symmetric may be difficult. Another method of passing two
