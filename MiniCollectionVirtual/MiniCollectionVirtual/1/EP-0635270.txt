<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a method for 
increasing bone mass in a subject by administration of PTH 

and raloxifene. Another aspect of the invention is a 
method for treating bone loss in a subject by 

administration of PTH and raloxifene. The invention 
further provides for a composition of PTH and raloxifene 

for increasing bone mass in a subject. Another aspect of 
the invention is a composition of PTH and raloxifene for 

treatment of bone loss in a subject.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to the use of
parathyroid hormone (PTH) for increasing bone mass when
used with raloxifene. This therapeutic combination
treatment results in an enhanced rate of bone formation and
an increase in bone mass.Adams et al., US Patent 5,118,667, discloses the
use of bone growth factors in combination with bone
resorption inhibitors, either simultaneously in one
composition or sequentially, to promote bone formation.Slovik et al. (J. Bone & Min. Res. 1:377-381,
1986) report the stimulation of bone growth by parathyroid
hormone (PTH). Raloxifene is described in US patent No.
4,418,068. In EP-A-584952 it is disclosed that raloxifene
is useful if the inhibition or prevention of bone loss.
Raloxifene has the following structure:
The present invention offers in vivo combination
therapy for increasing bone mass through the administration
of raloxifene and PTH. This combination provides more
effective therapy for prevention of bone loss and
replacement of bone than the components alone.The present invention includes a method for
increasing bone mass in a subject by administration of PTH
and raloxifene.Another aspect of the invention is a method for
treating bone loss in a subject by administration of PTH
and raloxifene.The invention further provides for a composition
of PTH and raloxifene for increasing bone mass in a 
subject.Another aspect of the invention is a composition
of PTH and raloxifene for treatment of bone loss in a
subject.When raloxifene is refered to it is understood
that it includes salts and solvates thereof. When PTH is
refered to, it not only includes the complete human hormone
but also includes portions which include the portion of the
hormone responsible for bone growth promotion, such as PTH
1-34, and analogs in which the amino acid sequence is
modified slightly however still retaining bone growth
promotion properties, such as PTH-RP..The term "inhibition of bone resorption" refers
to prevention of bone loss, especially the inhibition of
removal of existing bone either from the mineral phase
and/or the organic matrix phase, through direct or indirect
alteration of osteoclast formation or metabolism. Thus,
the term "inhibitor of bone resorption" as used herein
refers to agents that prevent bone loss by the direct or
indirect alteration of osteoclast formation or metabolism.The term "osteogenically effective" means that
amount which effects the formation and differentiation of
bone. As used herein, an osteogenically effective dose is
also "pharmaceutically
