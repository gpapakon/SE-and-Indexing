<ABSTRACT>
A spinel comprising from 20 to 40 and preferably 27 to 33 
weight percent magnesium expressed as MgO, from 55 to 77 and 

preferably 63 to 69 weight percent aluminum expressed as Al₂O₃ 

from 2 to 4 weight percent titanium expressed as TiO₂, less than 
1 weight percent silicon expressed as SiO₂, less than 0.5 weight 

percent iron expressed as Fe₂O₃ and less than 0.5 weight percent 
calcium expressed as CaO. The invention further comprises a 

method for the preparation of an aluminum-magnesium spinel 
containing less than 0.5 weight percent iron expressed as Fe₂O₃ 

which comprises fusing bauxite and magnesite together in the 
presence of metallic aluminum and separating the spinel from 

freed impurities. Preferably from 19 to 39 weight percent 
magnesite and from 56 to 76 weight percent bauxite and from about 

1.5 to about 5 weight percent aluminum are used in the fusion and 
more preferably from 63 to 69 weight percent bauxite and from 27 

to 33 weight percent magnesite and from about 2 to 4 weight 
percent metallic aluminum are used in the fusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of spinels by co-fusion
of bauxite and magnesite.Spinels as used herein means magnesium aluminum oxide
(MgAl2O4) which is usually written as a mixed oxide MgO·Al2O3.
Such spinels as above written may be in the presence of either
excess alumina (Al2O3) or excess magnesia (MgO) or minor
impurities, i.e. impurities which do not significantly affect the
properties of the spinel and are usually, but not necessarily in
an amount of less than five percent.Spinels are known refractories, i.e. they are stable at high
temperatures, melting at about 2135 degrees Celsius (3,875
degrees Fahrenheit). Spinels therefore find utility as a
structural material for high temperature furnaces, especially
those used for smelting and melting metals. Spinels have, for
example, found utility as a structural material for melting iron
and iron containing metals such as various steels.Unfortunately, unless the spinels are almost free of iron
oxides, i.e. less than one percent by weight, spinels may be
subject to serious corrosion by the molten metals contained in
the furnace. Up to the present time, it has been difficult and
costly to eliminate iron impurities from spinel. Attempts to use carbon in fusions employing bauxite and
magnesite to reduce the iron content are not commercially
feasible because the carbon causes magnesium oxide to fume and
evaporate from the system.It has, for example, been known that low iron spinel can be
prepared by fusing essentially pure alumina, e.g. pure white
aluminum ore (99.5% alumina), with magnesite (97.5% MgO).
To obtain pure spinels the US-A-1 448 010 uses
pure aluminum oxide.
The
resulting spinel product will usually contain less than one
percent iron oxide but is prohibitively costly for almost all
commercial applications due to a limited supply of pure white
aluminum ore. In addition employing pure white aluminum ore for
such a purpose would rapidly deplete supplies of the ore which
has other uses. Using synthetically produced or purified alumina
adds synthesis or purification steps which as a practical matter
increase the cost to such an extent that the resulting spinel
simply cannot be used in commodity applications.Additionally, the thermal shock resistance, the hardness,
and the physical shock resistance of spinels made from pure
alumina desirably could be improved.Another disadvantage associated with known spinels is that
significant amounts of energy are required to form them, usually
electrical energy applied to an arc furnace. Reduction of
