<DESCRIPTION>
 Description Nonaqueous Cold Sterilant Technical FieldA hypocompatible biodegradable non-aqueous cold sterilant effective against a wide range of pathogenic organisms including bacterial spores.Background ArtSterilants are used in many areas, such as in the sterilization of laboratory, surgical, dental and other equipment. It is customary in hospital practice to sterilize instruments overnight, using chemical sterilizing agents or other sterilizing methods.The most common methods of sterilization involve either the use of pressurized steam, dry heat or ethylene oxide. However, some of these methods are cumbersome, tedious and time-consuming, often damage the sterilized material and require expensive equipment and skilled technicians.Moreover, steam sterilization is impracticable for many plastic devices and delicate instruments which are sensitive to elevated temperatures.Many chemical sterilization methods have been developed as substitutes for steam sterilization. Unfortunately most have shortcomings. Phenols and formaldehyde compositions have considerable sporicidal activity but have objectionable odors and extreme toxicity. Ethanol, isopropyl alcohol and the quaternary ammonium compounds have been used, and though less odorous and toxic, lack the activity of the phenols and formaldehyde compositions. 

 Compositions comprising saturated dialdehydes with alkalinating agents have also been used. Though such compounds are satisfactory as chemical sterilization agents their sporicidal activity is limited to certain pH ranges, require up to ten (10) hours to work, and have certain limits on stability.U.S. 3,282,775 shows a sporicidal composition including saturated dialdehydes containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and a cationic surface active agent. More specifically, these compounds include malonaldehyde, succinaldehyde, oxaldehyde (glyoxal), adipaldehyde and preferably, glutaraldehyde. The quantity of saturated dialdehyde used may vary from about 0.1 percent to about 2 percent depending upon which particular dialdehyde is selected. Moreover, one may safely depart from this concentration without seriously detracting from its effectiveness. For example, if desired, the final concentration of dialdehyde may be increased up to as much as 10 percent or decreased as low as 0.05 percent. However, amounts in excess of 2 percent are unnecessary, extremely toxic and wasteful. In actual practice a range of from .1 percent to about 2 percent is preferred. The compounds may be diluted either with water or lower
