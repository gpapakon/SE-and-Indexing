<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for 
transmitting a lightwave signal. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to apparatus for transmitting a 
video signal, audio signal, control signal, or digital data 
between a transmitting unit, such as a single-unit 
video-camera recorder, and a receiving unit connected to a 
television receiver using a lightwave signal so as to provide 
a contactless link between the units. With the widespread use of single-unit video-camera 
recorders among general users the portability and ease of 
carrying such units have become an important factor. Thus, 
most manufacturers has been miniaturizing the circuits and 
mechanisms of such units and reducing the weight thereof. 
Further manufacturers have developed high-performance 
apparatuses capable of performing many different operations to 
increase the competitiveness of such units. However, increasing the capability of such 
high-performance single-unit video-camera recorders to perform 
many different operations has resulted in an increase in the 
number of buttons on such units. Further, the operation of 
such units have become complex causing general users to 
experience some difficulty in taking pictures using the units. 
Such difficulty in use could become a factor to prevent 
widespread use of the single-unit video-camera recorder. 
Accordingly, in recent years, single-unit video-camera 
recorders, having the capability of performing a limited  
 
number of operations, have been marketed. Thus, it is the aim 
of the manufacturers to provide products easily usable by any 
person and to thereby spread the use of audio-visual (AV) 
equipment. Currently when playing back signals on a single-unit 
video-camera recorder, some trouble is experienced, linking 
the single-unit video-camera recorder and a television 
receiver. A cord connected between the single-unit video-camera 
recorder and television receiver transmits signals from 
one unit to the other. Accordingly, there is provided a 
single-unit video-camera recorder such as described on page 29 
in the operation manual of SONY single-unit video-camera 
recorder, Model CCD-TR1, having a station on which the 
single-unit video-camera recorder can be fixedly held. The 
station being connected to the single-unit video-camera 
recorder permits, in just one-touch operation, playing back of 
signals in the television receiver. Even when such a station is used, however, it 
is still necessary for the user, when mounting the single-unit 
video-camera recorder
