<ABSTRACT>
A reactor for carrying out endothermic or weakly exothermic reactions, in particular for the treatment of contaminated liquefied, liquefiable and/or solid hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon compounds with hydrogen, has at least one feedline for substrate (5) to be treated, hydrogen-containing reagent (7) and, if necessary, a catalyst, a pressure vessel (14), facilities for heating (8) and for monitoring the operating parameters, and a discharge line for treated substrate (10), wherein the inner wall of the pressure vessel (9) consists at least partially of pipes (16) joined to one another to form a heating jacket (19) which has at least one inlet line (8a) and at least one outlet line (8b) for a heating medium.
