<ABSTRACT>
A process for removing the trans isomer from a mixture of the 
cis isomer and the trans isomer of an 

azolylmethylcyclopentanol derivative of the formula (I): 

wherein R¹ and R² each independently represents a hydrogen 
atom or an alkyl group; n is an integer of from 0 to 5; 

each X, which may be identical or different when n is an 
integer of from 2 to 5, represents a halogen atom, an alkyl 

group, a haloalkyl group, a phenyl group, a cyano group or 
a nitro group; and A represents a nitrogen atom or a CH 

group; which process comprises dehydrating selectively the 
trans isomer in the presence of an acid, and isolating the 

cis isomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
separating geometric isomers of azolylmethylcyclopentanol 
derivatives having fungicidal activity. Fungicidally 
active azolylmethylcyclopentanol derivatives represented by 
the formula (I): 
wherein, R¹ and R² each independently represent a hydrogen 
atom or an alkyl group; each X represents a halogen atom, 
an alkyl group, a haloalkyl group, a phenyl group, a cyano 
group or a nitro group; n is an integer of from 0 to 5; A 
represents a nitrogen atom or a CH group; and each X may be 
identical or different when n is an integer of from 2 to 5, 
exist in two stereoisomeric forms, one of which is a 
geometric isomer having a hydroxy group and a benzyl group 
on the same side about the plane of the cyclopentane ring 
(hereinafter referred to as cis isomer), and the other is a 
geometric isomer having a hydroxy group and a benzyl group 
on the opposite side about the plane of the cyclopentane 
ring (hereinafter referred to as trans isomer). Of these 
two kinds of isomers, the cis isomer is known to exhibit 
greater fungicidal activity.  The processes for obtaining the cis isomer, therefore, 
have been proposed as in the following: 
(1) An oxirane derivative in cis form (isomer in which an 
oxygen atom in the oxirane ring and a benzyl group are 
placed on the same side about the plane of the cyclopentane 
ring) of the following formula (A) is separated by silica 
gel column chromatography, and the separated oxirane 
derivative in cis form is then converted into an 
azolylmethylcyclopentanol derivative of the following 
formula (A-I) (USP No. 4,938,792). 
In the formulae above, R¹¹ and R¹² each independently 
represent a hydrogen atom or a C₁-C₅ alkyl group; R¹⁰ 
represents a halogen atom, a C₁-C₅ alkyl group or a phenyl 
group; m is an integer of from 0 to 2; and A represents a 
nitrogen atom or a CH group; provided that both R¹¹ and R¹² 
do not represent a hydrogen atom simultaneously. (2) A 1,2-diol derivative of the following formula (B) is 
converted into an azolylmethylcyclopentanol derivative in 
cis form of the following formula (B-1) (USP No. 
5,142,061).  In the formulae above, n is an integer of from 0 to 5; 
R³ represents a halogen atom, a nitro group, a cyano group, 
an alkyl group, a haloalkyl group or a phenyl group; R⁴ and 
R⁵ each independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl 
group; A represents a nitrogen atom or a CH group; and R⁶ 
represents an optionally substituted alkyl or aryl group. (3) An azolylmethyloxabicyclohexane derivative
