<ABSTRACT>
Abrasion-resistant fluoropolymer mixture comprising     (A) from 75 to 99% by weight of a fluorocarbon polymer (B) from 1 to 25% by weight of an oxidised polyarylene sulphide and, based on the sum (A) + (B),   (C) from 0 to 15% by weight of a filler.   The mixture is used for the production of lining tubes for Bowden cables which are pressure-resistant and abrasion-resistant.
