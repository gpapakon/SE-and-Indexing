<ABSTRACT>
An antenna for a base station comprising a plurality of antenna 
arrays (40; Fig. 6a) each capable of forming a multiplicity of 

separate overlapping narrow beams in azimuth, the arrays being 
positioned such that the beams formed by the arrays provide a 

coverage in azimuth wider than each array. Means for receiving 
r.f. signals for a given call include a plurality of receive amplifiers 

(62; Fig. 6a) one for each beam of an antenna array, means for 
combining the outputs of the plurality of receive amplifiers, 

switching means for applying the combined receive signals to the 
r.f. transceiver handling the given call; and a single power amplifier 

(52; Fig. 6a) for transmitting r.f. signals for the given call for 
applying the transceiver transmit signal to an individual one of the 

beams.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a base station antenna arrangement, for
use in a Cellular Radio communications system.Cellular radio systems are currently increasing in use throughout
the world providing telecommunications to mobile users. In order to
meet the capacity demand, within the available frequency band
allocation, cellular radio systems divide a geographic area to be
covered into cells. At the centre of each cell is a base station,
through which the mobile stations communicate. The available
communication channels are divided between the cells such that
the same group of channels are reused by certain cells. The
distance between the reused cells is planned such that the co-channel
interference is maintained at a tolerable level.When a new cellular radio system is initially deployed, operators
are often interested in maximising the uplink (mobile station to base
station) and downlink (base station to mobile station) range. The
ranges in many systems are uplink limited due to the relatively low
transmitted power levels of hand portable mobile stations. Any
increase in range means that less cells are required to cover a
given geographic area, hence reducing the number of base stations
and associated infrastructure costs.When a cellular radio system is mature the capacity demand can
often increase, especially in cities, to a point where more, smaller
size cells are needed in order to meet the required capacity per unit
area. The process used to create these smaller cells is known as
cell splitting. Any technique that can provide additional capacity 
without the need for cell-splitting will again reduce the number of
base station sites and associated infrastructure costs.The antenna used at the base station site can potentially make
significant improvements to the range and capacity of a cellular
radio system. The ideal base station antenna pattern is a beam of
narrow angular width as shown in Fig 1a. The narrow beam is
directed at the wanted mobile, is narrow in both the azimuth and
elevation planes, and tracks the mobile's movements. When
compared to an omni-directional antenna, such a beam will have
the dual benefits of having high gain, leading to increased range in
thermal noise limited initial deployments, and rejecting interference
from co-channel reuse cells allowing higher capacity without cell
splitting in mature deployments. The narrow beam reduces
interference in a balanced manner on the uplink and downlink. On
the uplink the base station receiver is protected from interference
generated by
