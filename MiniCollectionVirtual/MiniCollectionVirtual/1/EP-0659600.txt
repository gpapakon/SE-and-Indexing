<ABSTRACT>
A cooler unit housing (12) is located in a 

passenger room (PR) near a dashboard (100) of a motor 
vehicle. A piping arrangement of the cooler unit 

comprises a pipe joint which is positioned at and 
supported by an opening (112) of the dashboard. The 

pipe joint has a first face (22) facing toward the 
passenger room (PR) and a second face (24) facing toward 

the engine room (ER). An expansion valve unit (20) is 
connected to the first face (22) of the pipe joint. 

Coolant inlet and output pipes are arranged, each 
having one end connected to an evaporator (14) in the 

cooler unit housing (12) and the other end led to the 
expansion valve unit (20). A grommet (30) is disposed 

between a peripheral portion of the opening (112) and 
an outer wall portion of the pipe joint thereby 

to establish sealing therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle comprising a dash panel between
an engine room and a passenger room and a cooler unit housing containing a
evaporator disposed in said passenger room near the dash panel according to the
preamble of independent claim 1 and, more particularly, to the piping arrangement
of the automotive air conditioner. More specifically, the present invention is
concerned with a piping arrangement of a cooler unit of the conditioner, which can
minimze the resistance against air flow in a housing of the cooler unit.In order to clarify the task of the present
invention, one conventional piping arrangement of
an automotive air conditioner will be briefly
described with reference to Fig. 11 of this document.
This arrangement is also shown in Japanese Utility Model First
Provisional Publication 63-96,918.In the drawing, designated by 100 is a
dash panel by which an engine room ER and a
passenger room PR are bounded. A cooler unit
housing 102 is arranged in the passenger room PR
near the dash panel 100, which contains an
evaporator 104. Air to be blown into the
passenger room PR is forced to flow through a
fin-unit face 104a of the evaporator 104. A
first pipe unit 106 including a coolant inlet
pipe 106a and a coolant outlet pipe 106b extends
from a tank 104b of the evaporator 104. A second
pipe unit 108 including a coolant inlet pipe 108a
and a coolant outlet pipe 108b is connected to
the first pipe unit 106 through a pipe joint 110.
The second pipe unit 108 extends out of the
cooler unit housing 102 to the engine room ER
through an opening 112 formed in the dash panel 
100. That is, the pipes 108a and 108b of the
second pipe unit 108 are led to a condenser and a
compressor respectively, which are both located
in the engine room ER. An expansion valve unit
114 is connected to an exposed portion of the
second pipe unit 108 in such a manner as to cover
the opening 112 of the dash panel 100. Because
the expansion valve unit 114 is not placed within
the cooler unit housing 102, the air resistance
in the cooler unit housing 102 can exhibit a
satisfied low level.Said expansion valve unit is located in the dash panel opening and having a first
surface facing toward said engine room as well as pipes connected with a
compressor and a condenser located in said engine room and which are directly
and individually connected to said expansion valve unit at the first surface thereof.
Furthermore, a sealing member is provided in said dash panel opening to cover
said expansion valve unit. In
