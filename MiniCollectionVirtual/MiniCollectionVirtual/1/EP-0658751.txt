<ABSTRACT>
For correction of spectra for stray radiation in a 
spectrometric instrument, spectral patterns are obtained for 

monochromatic radiation at a plurality of calibration 
wavelengths directed into the wavelength analyzer of the 

instrument. The peak profile in each pattern is replaced and 
the resulting data are interpolated to the ordered wavelengths 

of the instrument and normalized to effect stray proportions. 
Spectral sample data for each ordered wavelength are 

multiplied by stray proportions to effect stray portions 
identified to the ordered wavelength and respectfully to the 

wavelength increments across the spectral range. The stray 
portions for each ordered wavelength are summed and the total 

is subtracted from the spectral data for the ordered 
wavelength to effect data corrected for stray.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spectrometric instruments, and
particularly to making corrections for stray radiation in such
instruments.Spectrometric instruments generally function to provide a
spectral analysis of radiation pertaining to a sample or an
astronomical source. The radiation source and/or the sample
may be internal or external to the instrument. The instrument
includes a wavelength analyzer, which comprises a spectral
dispersion element such as a prism or, more commonly in
precision instruments, an optical grating. The analyzer
further includes a detector system. In one type, the
detector has a single photosensitive component with a narrow
entrance slit, and the dispersion element is mechanically
rotated to scan a range of radiation wavelengths over the
detector. In another type, the detector has an array of
photosensitive pixel areas for detecting spectral increments
across the range simultaneously. Array detectors have been
made practical in solid state devices providing small adjacent
pixels. The array may be either linear to receive a spectrum
from a single dispersion element, or two dimensional for
crossed dispersion elements. A two dimensional detector is
disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4,820,048 (Barnard).Modern precision spectrometric instruments include computer
programming for calibration and treatment of the spectral
information. U.S. patent No. 5,229,838 (Ganz et al)
illustrates a grating with an array detector and teaches a
system for calibrating amplitude linearity, and also teaches 
a particular type of instrument in which optical fibers are
utilized to convey source radiation to a remote sample of
liquid and back to the analyzer. U.S. patent application
serial No. 834,448 filed February 12, 1992 (Tracy et al), of
the present assignee, discloses instrument standardization
using computer programming, and also illustrates correction
for background which generally represents radiation and
instrument noise without the source in place. U.S. patent No.
5,023,804 (Hoult) teaches a method and apparatus for comparing
spectra by means of computer programming.With improvements in sensitivity resulting from advancing
technology such as in the foregoing patents, it has been found
that stray radiation is a limiting factor. Stray radiation
results from imperfect gratings and internal reflections.Therefore, objects of the invention are to provide a novel
method and a novel apparatus to determine and correct for
stray radiation in a spectrometric instrument. A further
object is to provide improved
