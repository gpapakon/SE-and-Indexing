<DESCRIPTION>
Field of Invention. This invention relates to elastomeric compression springs.
The preferred embodiment of our invention is primarily directed to a novel compression
spring formed of a minimum quantity of an elastomer that is oriented in the radial
direction to provide a low spring rate. The invention has broad, varied applications that
extend from an auxiliary spring for eliminating side loads in the struts of automobiles,
to vibration isolation in vehicle platforms, and to energy absorption in athletic shoes.Related Art. Some light weight automobiles such as the Cutless Supreme® and
Lumina® of General Motors Corporation have required auxiliary springs to balance the
moments about and to eliminate side loads imposed upon their strut assemblies. An
auxiliary spring developed and successfully, sold for that purpose is depicted in Figure
1 of the drawings. It is formed of a copolyester polymer elastomer manufactured and
sold under the designation 4069 by E.I. duPont de Nemoirs under the trademark
Hytrel®. This related art is more fully described in the "Detail Description" of this
application. Additional prior art related to the present invention are U.S. Patents, Nos.
4,198,037 and 4,566,678 which issued to Miner Enterprises, Inc. on applications of David
G. Anderson. Each of these patents focus oii a method of manufacture of compression
springs from the Hytrel® material and its associated compression set problems. Both
are primarily directed to applications requiring very high spring rates for absorbing
substantial quantities of energy in applications such as the railcar industry. In addition,
they focus on elimination of the compression set problem through an axial, rather than
a radial, precompression step during manufacture.It is also known from document US-A 4,962,916 an elastomeric spring comprising a hollow
body fonned by a series of collapsible wall sections. Each wall section is a generally cylindrical
lobe made of an elastomer. The lobes are in a superposed relationship and are designed to allow
the spring rate to progressively go from soft to very hard.This invention is a compression spring formed of an hollow body for absorbing
energy in a radial direction. It is manufactured from an elastomer whose ratio of plastic
deformation to its elastic deformation is greater than 1.5 to 1. Preferably, the elastomer
is the Hytrel® copolyester polymer elastomer of the duPont company. In the preferred
embodiment, the hollow body has at least one elongated, non-circular cross section
which, upon

<CLAIMS>
A method of making a radial compression spring characterized by the fact that it comprises
the following steps:


a) forming a preform (20') of an elastomer having a ratio of plastic strain to elastic strain that
is greater than 1.5 to 1,
b) said prefonn comprising a hollow non-circular body (22') having at least two wall sections
(24') interconnected by joining sections (25'),
c) applying a radial force to said hollow body (22') for forming a pennanent bend in said wall
sections of at least 45 degrees and for orienting said elastomer; and
d) releasing said force.
A method of making a radial comprcssion spring as recited in claim 1 in which said radial
precompression force results in a bending of said wall section (24') of the preform (20') by more

than 90 degrees.
A method as recited in claim 2 in which the radial precompression force results in a
pennanent bend in said wall sections (24') of approximately 90 degrees.
A radial spring (20) comprising a hollow spring section (22) formed of an elastomer,
characterized by the fact that:


a) said elastomer has a ratio of plastic strain to elastic strain that is greater than 1.5 to 1;
b) said hollow spring section (22) has non-circular walls (24);
c) at least two of said walls (24) have an angle therein greater than 45 degrees, said angle
being formed by plastic deformation of said walls (24) through the application of force in a

direction radial to the hollow spring section (22);
d) said hollow spring section (22) having a molecular structure oriented as a result of plastic
deformation of its walls (24) in a radial direction.
A radial spring as recited in claim 4 in which said spring (20) comprises at least two
sections (22) integrally attached to one another. 
A radial spring as recited in claim 4 in which the molecular structure of said walls (24) is
oriented in a second direction.
A radial compression spring comprising a hollow body (40, 40') formed of an elastomer,
said hollow body (40, 40') being fonned of walls sections (42,42') , characterized by the fact that:


a) said elastomer has a ratio of plastic strain to elastic strain that is greater than 1.5 to 1;
b) said wall sections (42, 42') include bends (48) as a result of an applied radial force bending
said walls section (42, 42') through an angle greater than 90 degrees for the purpose of orienting

the molecular structure of said wall sections (42, 42').
A radial compression spring as recited in claim 7 in which said hollow body (40, 40') has
the shape of a diamond.
A radial compression spring as recited in claim 7 in which each of said wall sections (42,
42') has more than one bend (48) resulting from radial precompression at different point on said

wall sections (42, 42').
A radial compression spring as recited in claim 8 in which said walls (42, 42') have been
subjected to torsional stress and in which said spring is designed to absorb torsional and

compression forces.
