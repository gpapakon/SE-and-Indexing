<ABSTRACT>
The device for treating patients with disturbances of posture and motor activity comprises holding means (1) for shoulder, pelvis, knee, feet, elbows, hands and fingers which are mutually connected by fixing elements. The fixing elements are designed as resilient tensile elements (2) and arranged on the body surface of the patient in antagonistic pairs according to the principle of the anatomical position of the skeletal muscles. Each tensile element (2) is connected to two holding means (1) and comprises a tension controller (3) for tensioning thereof, which is located between the tensile element (2) and one of the holding means (1) via a clasp (5).

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for treating patients with a disorder affecting
posture and motor activity, with retainers (1) which are intended

for the pelvis and the feet and which have securing elements in
the form of elastic tension elements (2), characterised in that


the apparatus is in the form of a functional brace and movement
corset and has additional retainers (1) for the shoulders,

knees, elbows, hands and fingers, wherein all the
retainers (1) are connected to one another by means of the

elastic tension elements (2), and
a regulating means (3) for the tension is fastened to each
elastic tension element (2), which regulating means connects

the elastic tension element (2) to one of the retainers (1),
wherein the elastic tension elements (2), which are connected

to the retainers (1), are to be disposed on the
patient's body surface in counteracting pairs relative to

joints in accordance with the principle of the anatomical
position of the skeletal muscle.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that each

regulating means (3) for the tension of the elastic tension elements
(2) is in the form of a strip (4), one end of which is connected

to the elastic tension element (2), whereas the other end
is fastened by a buckle (5) which in each case is provided on one

of the retainers (1).
