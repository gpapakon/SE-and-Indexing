<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method for removing strongly adhered dirt from wood objects. The invention has three 
particularities: 1) the dirt is removed without taking off varnishes, silver guilts; 2) it gives the objects a natural luster; 3) 

it is harmless for the users. In a first phase, a cleaning cream comprised of saponified grease, excipient, linseed oil, olive oil, 
sodic tetraborate, clove essence and pine essence, is applied to the wood object. In the second phase, the cream is 

removed by means of an agglutinating emulsion comprised of an alkalinized solution, biodistilled glycerine, 
polyethyleneglycol 400, sodic tetraborate and pine essence.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a treatment designed to cleaning 
and preserving pieces of furniture and guided and sized wood objects, treating to carry 
out a thorough cleaning without removing varnish, velatura and gold varnish (corladuras). The special application of the invention meant to obtain a good cleaning without 
destroying and deteriorating all these own qualities, taking care in your entirety, with own 
attributes in performance and finish. The application of this method very easy to use, implies great advantage in the 
cleaning and preserving of old furniture's, gilded and sized wood objects. This use is 
applied to the restoration world. The product is harmless to the objects and the persons, 
because isn't given of toxic vapours, isn't dangerous for the skin. It's very quick and easy 
to use and leaves a natural protective shine, which makes unnecessary your varnishing or 
waxed. US-A-3 955 999 discloses a cream wax composed of bees wax, 
paraffin wax, tarpentine, linseed oil, naphtha, soap and water. The method applicable to this invention is the result of many years of research, 
after testing on over fifty painted wood pieces and ethnographic, polychromatic 
sculptures and gilded and sized wood objects. The composition and methodology used represent innovative state of the art 
techniques, not only for the utilized components, but also for the product which is 
innovator in this field. Many and assorted are the used mixtures and products, but anyone 
has those attributes. In summary, the method consists in the use of two different compositions, which 
are comprised of different components and are applied in a specific order and through a 
conveniently designed methodology. Given the nature of the material to be threaded and considering the great variety, 
the components of this process may be varied depending on the pieces to be treated. 
Thus, the proportion of these components should be used within an ample range of 
proportion given refers, in any case, to criteria for a standard use.  
 Method for cleaning and preserving pieces of furniture and gilded and sized 
wood objects.Comprises the following phases: 
a) Extend on de surface, a cleaning cream made from saponified fat (100 to 
200 gr.); excipient (100 to 200 ml.); linseed oil (25 to 50 ml.); olive oil (25 to 50 ml.); 
wool fat (25 to 50 gr.); native wax (10 to 25 gr.): clove essence (1 to 2 ml.); pine essence 
(10 to 20 ml.); sodic tetraborate (3 to 6 gr.). This cream is prepared to T=100ยบ C. (cons) 
and 760 mm. Hg., beginning with

, caracterized on a first 
stage by extending, on the object to be treated, a cream consisting essentially of 100 to 

200 g of saponified fat, 100 to 200 ml of excipient, 25 to 50 ml of linseed oil, 25 to 50 
ml of olive oil, 25 to 50 g of wool fat, 10 to 25 g of native wax, 3 to 6 g sodium 

tetraborate, 1 to 2 ml of cloves oil, and 5 to 10 ml of pine oil, wherein said cream is 
preparable in a water bath under constant stirring in order to obtain an homogeneous 

mixture having a pH between 8 and 9, and wherein said cream is applied to the wood 
object for a time according to its condition, and it is later removed with cotton.

FURNITURE AND GILDED AND SIZED WOOD OBJECTS
, according to the 
first claim, wherein in a second stage said object is subjected to the action of cleaning with an 

agglutinating solution by treating said object with cotton impregnated with an emulsion 
consisting essentially of 200 to 300 ml of alkaline excipient, 25 to 75 ml of bidistilled 

glycerin, 25 to 75 ml of polyethyleneglycol 400, 1 to 3 g of sodium tetraborate, and 5 to 
10 g. of pine oil, wherein said emulsion is preparable by constant stirring at room 

temperature of said components in order to obtain a homogeneous mixture.
