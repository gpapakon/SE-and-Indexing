<ABSTRACT>
In a wireless headphone (2) in which an infra-red signal 
transmitted from a transmitting apparatus (1) is received and a 

received output is reproduced as an audible sound by headphone unit 
portions (11, 12), a first light receiving element (19) is provided on 

a top portion (16) of a head band portion (8) so that, when a listener 
is wearing the wireless headphone (2), a light receiving surface (19a) 

of the first light receiving element (19) is directed rearwards. 
Second and third light receiving elements (20) are provided on the 

headphone unit portions (11, 12) so that light receiving surfaces (20a) 
of the second and third light receiving elements (20) are directed 

forwards with respect to the listener.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wireless headphones.A wireless headphone system has recently been proposed in which a signal is
transmitted by means of infra-red rays from a transmitter, and is received by the
headphones at a position distant from the transmitter.Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. JP-A-55-82596 discloses such a
wireless headphone system in which the usable range of the headphone is not limited
by a headphone cord, unlike previous headphone systems. Further, infra-red rays are
utilised to prevent the wireless headphone from interfering with other types of
radiation such as radio waves. An infra-red signal light transmitted from the
transmitter is received by a light receiving element provided on a top portion of a
head band portion of the wireless headphone. An output signal from the light
receiving element is demodulated and reproduced by an amplifier, a demodulating
circuit and a reproducing circuit powered by a power supply source such as a
secondary battery or the like incorporated within the headphone, and is then fed to
a headphone unit portion. Thus the headphone unit portion can derive the reproduced
output as an audible signal, transmitted from the transmitter.A problem exists that charging terminals for the secondary battery within the
headphones can become contaminated by hair, skin or oily components from the
listener's head. This can lead to corrosion and poor contact in the charging
operation.US-A-4 710 693 discloses a charging draw having sprung contacts for
connecting to exposed charging terminals on a rechargeable headphone device.US-A-4 229 829 discloses a headphone charging arrangement using inductive
coupling of the charging power.This invention provides a wireless headphone comprising a change-over switch
provided in the headphone body for changing between operable and inoperable states
of the wireless headphone;
characterised by:
charging terminals for charging a secondary battery incorporated within a headphone 
body, the charging terminals being provided on the headphone body at positions in
which they would contact the listener's head when the listener is wearing the wireless
headphone; andclosing means for closing the charging terminals in a ganged relation to the change-over
operation of the change-over switch when switching the wireless headphone to
the operable state.The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the
accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like
references, and in which:
