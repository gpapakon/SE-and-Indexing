<ABSTRACT>
A method of cleaning and maintaining a hot water heater tank contaminated with water scale and sediment by introducing an aqueous acidic treatment solution from a reservoir (8), retaining the acidic solution for a sufficient time to dissolve or suspend said scale and sediment, and then draining the spent solution containing the dissolved or suspended scale and sediment to provide a clean hot water heater tank (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD OF CLEANING AND MAINTAINING HOT WATER HEATERS Background of the inventionIt is well known that hardness in water sources varies widely in composition depending on the source and results in scale deposition and sedimenta- tion wherever water is used. Scale deposition and sedimentation is particularly troublesome in residen¬ tial and commercial hot water heaters. In these systems, the formation of hard water scale and sedi¬ ment rapidly reduces the efficiency of heat transfer thus increasing the cost of heating the water either by gas or electricity. Also, scale and sedimentation will increase the possibility of corrosion in the water heater which will eventually result in leakage and the necessity of replacement. There have been some physical means that have been developed to minimize the formation of scal and sediment in hot water heaters. The creation of a vortex by the water inlet stream has been used to generate a turbulence inside the tank during water addition which supposedly keeps the solids that are formed in suspension so that they can be removed in 

the water flow. This would only function during water flow and does net prevent sedimentation or scale formation on the heat exchange surface when water is not flowing. Other devices r such as magnets, have been employed to prevent hard scale deposits but are of questionable effectiveness and usually require frequent tank drainage.Further improvements are needed for cleaning and/or maintaining hot water heaters free from scale and sediment. 
Summary of the InventionThis invention is directed to a method of cleaning and maintaining a hot water heater. Hot water heater tanks having interior contamination of water scale and sediment are cleaned by introducing an aqueous acidic treatment solution into the hot water heater tank in a sufficient amount for removal of the scale and sediment. The acidic treatment solution is retained in the heater tank for a sufficient time to dissolve or suspend the scale and sediment.. There¬ after, the spent solution containing the dissolved or suspended scale and sediment is removed from the tank to provide a clean hot water heater. Mineral acids or organic acids, and mixtures thereof, are employed as the acidic treatment solutions according to the method. In another feature of the method, by checking the pH of the drained solution, it may be determined whether additional cleaning is necessary. The acidic treatment solution may contain further additives such as chelating agents and/or dispersing agents to assist
