 CARPETHAVINGIMPROVED APPEARANCERETENTIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the inventionThis invention relates to carpet having improved appearance retention characteristics. Another aspect of this invention relates to cross-linked fibers for use in the fabrication of the carpet of this invention and in processes for forming said cross-linked fibers.2. Prior ArtCrosslinked polymer materials are known. See for example Khim Volokna pp. 20-32 (1965); U.S. Patent Nos. 3,801,347 and 3,286,322; DE 2,707,066; DE 1,444,076; BP 1 565 820 and Chem. Vlakna. 1971, 21 PP- 28-33.A desirable characteristic of carpet is that the carpet retains its appearance when subjected to normal traffic. Unfortunately, most carpet made from conventional carpet fibers lacks good appearance retention characteristics because the individual tufts of the carpet lose ply-twist when the carpet is subjected to normal traffic. This loss of ply-twist causes tuft ends to open up or â€¢"bloom", lose tuft endpoint definition and become entangled with neighboring tuft ends which gives the pile a matted appearance and causes the pile to develop "walkout" in traffic areas. The term "appearance retention" is used to describe the ability of carpet to retain its initial appearance with respect to tuft endpoint definition and lack of matting after being subjected to repeated traffics, where each "traffic" is the occurrence of an individual walking across the carpet.Efforts in the past to improve the appearance retention characteristics of carpet have not proven entirely satisfactory. It is apparent, therefore, that carpets having improved appearance retention characteristics and a pleasing appearance and hand 

would constitute a major contribution in the art.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to an improved carpet of the type having a primary backing and heat set pile fiber (tuft) in the form of individual lengths of plied fiber, each of which projects upwardly form said backing terminating at a cut end, the improvement comprising pile fiber formed from a crosslinked polymeric material having an effective cross-link density. The carpet of this invention has several advantages. For example, the carpet of this invention exhibits improved appearance retention. The carpet of this invention also has a pleasing initial appearance and hand.This invention also relates to (an improved process of forming cross-linked fibers which provide carpets having improved appearance retention which comprises treating a twisted and heat set

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. An improved carpet of the type having a primary backing and twisted pile fiber in the form of individually lengths of plied fiber, each of which projects upwardly from said backing terminating at the cut end, the improvement comprising pile fiber formed from the crosslinked polymeric material having an effective cross-link density in which polymer chains are crosslinked by a divalent cross-linking moiety.
2. An improved carpet according to claim 1 wherein said crosslink density is from about 1 to about 20. 3. An improved carpet according to claim 2 wherein said polymeric material is selected from the group consisting of polymers having a moiety of the formula -N(H))- in the polymer chain.
4. An improved carpet according to claim 3 wherein said polymeric material is a polyamide.
5. An improved carpet according to claim 4 wherein said polyamide is nylon 6 or nylon 6,6.
6. An improved carpet according to claim 5 wherein said polyamide is nylon 6. 7. An improved carpet according to claim 3 wherein said divalent crosslinking moiety is an organic moiety which is covalently bonded to the polymeric chains by covalent bonds.
8. An improved carpet according to claim 7 wherein said crosslinking moiety is a divalent group of the formula: -C(H)(R)- or -0C(H)(R)- wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to about 7 carbon atoms, or combination thereof.
9. An improved carpet according to claim 8 wherein R is hydrogen. 10. A process of forming crosslinked fibers which provide carpets having improved appearance retention which comprises treating a twisted fiber formed from a polymeric material with an effective cross-linking agent for a time and at a temperature sufficient to cross link chains of said polymeric material to form
