<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electric power steering apparatus which detects a ground fault of a motor and a short circuit fault between the motor and the power supply (referred to "closed circuit fault" hereinafter), the motor producing auxiliary steering force to assist a driver in steering. The electric power steering apparatus performs the detection of the faults without false detections due to the back electromotive force and regenerative current of the motor, and subsequently performs a fail-safe operation. An electric power steering apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from JP05-185937A.Figure 12 illustrates a conventional electric power steering apparatus disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 4-31171. A motor 1 that generates an auxiliary steering force is controllably driven by a motor drive circuit 2. The motor drive circuit 2 is in the form of an H-bridge circuit using power transistors. The current flowing through the motor 1 is detected by a motor current detecting circuit 3. The voltage across the terminals of the motor 1 is detected by a motor terminal voltage detecting circuit 4.A clutch 5, which mechanically disconnects the motor 1 from a steering shaft, is driven by a clutch drive circuit 6. A torque sensor 7 detects the steering force applied by a driver and a vehicle speed sensor 8 detects the cruising speed of the vehicle.A microcomputer 9 reads the outputs of the torque sensor 7, vehicle speed sensor 8, and others. The microcomputer 9 controls the motor 1 such that the motor 1 generates an optimum auxiliary steering force in accordance with the driving conditions, and detects the line faults on the basis of the outputs of the motor terminal voltage detecting circuit 4 and others. The power supply voltage from a battery 10 is supplied to the motor 1 via the motor drive circuit 2 and to the microcomputer 9 via an ignition switch 11.The operation of the conventional apparatus will be described. When the driver throws the ignition switch 11 to the ON position, the microcomputer 9 receives electric power and reads the outputs of the torque sensor 7 and vehicle speed sensor 8. In accordance with the cruising conditions of the vehicle and the steering operation performed by the driver, the microcomputer 9 computes an optimum auxiliary steering force that the motor 1 should generate.The motor 1 is a DC motor where the output torque is proportional to the motor current. Therefore, the motor current indicates the generated auxiliary
