<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a graphics display, 
particularly to a straight line coordinate generator for 
drawing a line by specifying lattice points (X and Y integer 
coordinates) which place on the line or the nearest to the 
line, and emitting or printing the lattice points. According to a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) system or a 
video game, a line which is displayed on a CRT (Cathode Ray 
Tube) or printed with a printing machine according to its start 
and end points often fails to be straight because of 
undesirable placement or size of holes at a shadowmask, or 
placement of display dots at a crystal dot matrix or at a 
printing face. More specifically, according to structural 
characteristics of CRT or the printing machine, the placement 
or the size of display dots are determined beforehand; 
therefore, if a line passes between the display dots, it fails 
to be straight. To overcome such inconveniences, instead of 
designating the start point and end point, lattice points on 
a line or lattice points which place near to the line are 
emitted or printed. Otherwise, data representing these lattice 
points are stored in a memory and are outputted later. (The 
direct emitting/ printing of a line and the indirect  
 
emitting/printing via a memory at an external device are 
referred to as "drawing". Emitting of a line on the CRT and 
printing of a line with the printing device are referred to as 
"display".) A device which implements the above drawing or the 
display often use a Bresenham algorithm. The basic Bresenham algorithm is described hereunder. 
("Computer Graphics" (1984) by J. d. Foley et al. translated 
by Atsumi Imamiya, published by Japan Computer Association, 
pp. 443-446) With the Bresenham algorithm, no division operation is 
included to decide a lattice point to be displayed. Moreover, 
all the operations are performed on integer data, so that they 
can be realized with a simple construction of hardware with a 
low cost. Actually, a straight line coordinate generator 
according to the above algorithm is integrally constructed as 
a LSI (Large Scale Integration), and has been for sale. The Bresenham straight line drawing algorithm will be 
described in detail hereunder. Given start coordinates (Xs, 
Ys) and end coordinates (Xe, Ye) of a line on a two-dimensional 
X-Y surface, coordinates of a nth lattice point, (Xn, Yn) will 
be figured out (strictly speaking, a line starting with the 
start point and ending with the end point should be referred 
to as a "segment" even though it
