<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder lock (1) comprises a lock cylinder (2) and a key-operated cylinder plug (3). A latching element (10) is located in the region of the boundary surface between the lock cylinder and the plug and is activated by an electrically actuable blocking element (11) which is movable between a release position and a blocking position. The plug cannot be turned by means of the key when the blocking element is in its blocking position. The latching element (10) has a length which is slightly shorter than the axial length of the plug (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylinder lock of 
the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1. In addition to their normal key-operated function, 
cylinder locks of this kind which also include an 
electrically-operated blocking function find use in 
many different areas. One such area is in controlling 
access to a locality or building in which a person in 
possession of a key to the lock is authorized access 
to the locality or building only at certain times of 
the day. The electric blocking function is able to 
prevent access automatically at predetermined times. In other cases, the lock key is provided with an electric 
code in addition to the normal key code. In this 
case, the key may include a transmitter which transmits 
a signal which is captured by an antenna located 
in the vicinity of the lock. When the signal transmitted 
from the key is the correct signal for that particular 
lock, the electric blocking function of the lock 
is deactivated, therewith enabling the key to be used 
in the normal manner. This enables various passage 
control systems to be constructed without needing to 
provide authorized and unauthorized persons with a 
number of different keys at different times. Naturally, attempts are made to force system locks 
that are equipped with electric blocking functions of 
the kind meant here, and it is therefore advantageous 
when the electrically activated blocking devices are 
able to make forcing of such locks more difficult.  
 Various types of electrically actuable cylinder plug 
blocking devices are known to the art. For instance, US-A 3,241,344 (Peters) discloses a key-activated 
cylinder lock which is intended to secure a 
deck lid, for instance, and which can also be activated 
electrically. This lock arrangement includes two 
mutually independent actuable locking devices which 
coact in a locked state but which can be actuated 
selectively and alternatively to open the lock. To 
this end, there is used a blocking element which is 
activated by an electromagnet or solenoid and which 
also coacts with a key-activated side-bar. The blocking 
element has a pointed end and engages with an 
obliquely positioned hook in the cylinder plug periphery, 
in the region of the side-bar. The cylinder 
lock can be opened by turning the key, whereupon the 
side-bar is withdrawn and the pointed end of the 
blocking element is displaced radially inwards while 
engaging the hook as the cylinder plug is turned 
against the action of a spring. The lock can also be 
opened by energizing

<CLAIMS>
A cylinder lock comprising a cylinder plug (3) 
which is mounted for rotation in a lock cylinder (2) 

and which includes one or more lock elements, such as 
a row of pins or tumblers or a side-bar (7) which are 

activated directly or indirectly by means of a key 
(4), and further comprising a latching element (10) 

which is mounted in the lock cylinder (2) and which in 
an active position prevents turning of the plug (3) 

and in a release position permits the plug to be 
turned, said latching element being urged by spring 

means (15) towards its latching position and coacts 
with an electrically activated blocking element (11), 

wherein in one position the blocking element (11) permits 
the latching element (10) to move radially to its 

release position, and in another position blocks the 
latching element in its locking position,
characterized
 in that the axial length of 
the latching element (10) is substantially greater 

than its thickness or diameter, that it extends axially 
in the region of the boundary surface between the 

lock cylinder (2) and the cylinder plug (3) and in 
their axial direction, that it engages in an axially 

extending groove (3c) or recess in the plug, and that 
it can move radially outwards to its release position, 

when the blocking element (11) which is mounted in the 
lock cylinder and has a part with axial extension is 

in its release position and the plug is turned by the 
key or in some other way. 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 1,
characterized
 in that the blocking element 
(11) is movable in its axial direction and that 

its part with axial extension is located at a small 
distance from the latching element (10).  

 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized
 in that the mutually adjacent 
parts of the latching element (10) and the blocking 

element (11) include projections (lla) and recesses 
(10c) which coact mutually in the release position 

and which projections engage a part of the other 
element that lacks a recess as the blocking element 

(11) is moved axially to the blocking position, therewith 
blocking movement of the latching element (10) to 

its release position. 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that axial movement of the 

blocking element (11) is achieved by means of an electric 
motor (12), an electromagnet (17) or the like, 

preferably having a shaft (13; 18) which is parallel 
with the axis of the latching element and the cylinder 

plug. 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that the axial movement of the 

blocking element is achieved with the aid of an electric 
motor (12) whose output shaft (13) coacts with an 

element which is connected to the blocking element 
(11) and which functions to convert the rotary motion 

of the motor to rectilinear motion. 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that said element which coacts 

with the bearing shaft and the blocking element, 
respectively is comprised of a screw/nut arrangement, 

a worm gear or like device. 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 5, 
characterized
 
in that the electric motor output 

shaft (13, 13a) has a screw thread which coacts with a  
 

corresponding screw thread on a nut part (11a) which 
extends at right angles to a part (11) functioning as 

a blocking element and is connected to said part, 
wherein when energized the electric motor rotates 

through a predetermined angle of rotation or a predetermined 
number of revolutions in one or the other 

direction while moving the blocking element (11) 
between its end positions. 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that the blocking element is 

connected to a movable part of the electromagnet. 
A cylinder lock according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the spring means includes 

two springs (15) one engaging the latching element 
(10) at each one of its ends.
