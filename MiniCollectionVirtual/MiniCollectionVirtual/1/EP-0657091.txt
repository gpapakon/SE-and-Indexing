<ABSTRACT>
A ballast for a gas discharge lamp comprises a freely oscillating inverter (C) powered by a d.c. source (A) and having a series circuit consisting of two controllable switches (319, 320) in parallel with the d.c. source. In parallel with the two switches there is a load circuit (D) having a series oscillating circuit consisting of an inductance (325) and a capacitor (326). The gas discharge lamp is connected in parallel with the oscillating circuit capacitor (326). For the purpose of dimming the gas discharge lamp (336) there is a control circuit which can affect the duty factor of at least one of the two switches dependently upon control information.
