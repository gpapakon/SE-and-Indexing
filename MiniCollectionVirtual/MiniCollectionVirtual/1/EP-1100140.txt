<ABSTRACT>
A fuel cell (50) has a joint body (51, 52, 53) produced by

interposing an electrolyte member (51) between a pair of
electrodes (52, 53), and has a separator (300A) which holds

the joint body (51, 52, 53). In the fuel cell (50) a
plurality of projections (313) projecting from a bottom of

the separator, and a rib portion (355, 356) are provided,
which rib portion divides an area where the projections

(313) project into a plurality of regions and which rib
portion forms a fluid passage for fluid which flows through

the separator (300A). The plurality of regions are
communicated with each other. Further, a gas passage (1505)

of supply gas being formed of a linear groove is provided,
and at least a portion thereof is bent into a semicircular

shape. An inwardly curved portion (1507c) of the
semicircular bent portion extends to the inside of the gas

passage, and the size of the curved portion (1507c) varies
in accordance with a variation in a total amount of supply

gas and vapor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel cell having a separator
in contact with a pair of electrodes
interposing an electrolyte film.A fuel cell is known as an apparatus for converting
fuel energy directly to electric energy. The fuel cell
is generally designed to be provided with a pair of
electrodes with an electrolyte film interposed
therebetween and to generate energy from the space
between the pair of electrodes by an electrochemical
reaction of fuel gas, e.g. hydrogen, and oxygen-containing
gas. In this reaction, fuel gas is supplied
to contact the surface of one of the electrodes and 
oxygen-containing gas is supplied to contact the surface
of another electrode. Energy can be drawn from the fuel
cell in a highly efficient manner as long as fuel gas
and oxygen-containing gas are supplied.FIG. 14 is a perspective view showing the
configuration of a stack structure 5 constituting a
general fuel cell and FIG. 15 is an exploded perspective
view showing the structure of a unit cell 10 as a basic
unit of the stack structure 5 shown in FIG. 14. In
general, the fuel cell, for example, of a polymer
electrolyte type is constituted of the stack structure
5 as shown in FIG. 14. This stack structure 5 is produced
by laminating a prescribed number of unit cells 10, then
disposing collector plates 26, 27, insulating plates 28,
29 and end plates 40, 45 sequentially at both ends of
the unit cells and then fastening these ends using, for
example, bolts and nuts such that it is maintained in
the state where a given pressure is applied in the
direction (the direction indicated by the arrow) of the
lamination of the unit cell. The collector plates 26,
27 are provided with output terminals 26A, 27A
respectively which enable it to output the electromotive
force generated in the fuel cell structured by the stack
structure 5.In such a fuel cell, a member called a separator
is provided which serves as a gas passage and a collector
electrode to supply fuel gas and oxygen-containing gas 
to the electrode surface. A straight type separator
provided with a plurality of linear passage grooves has
been conventionally used. Serpentine type separator in
which one passage groove is bent (disclosed in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. HEI 7-263003)
and lattice type separators in which plural projections
are arranged and a passage is formed by a gap between
these projections have also been known.The unit cell 10 as a basic unit of the stack
structure 5 of FIG. 14, as shown in FIG. 15, includes
a joint body (reaction
