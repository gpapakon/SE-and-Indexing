<DESCRIPTION>
A number of patents disclose annealing metallic 
alloys which are at least about 90% amorphous and have 
compositions which are generally represented by 
FeaCobBcSidCe. The alloys of U.S. Patent No. 4,834,815 have 
about 75 to about 85 atomic % iron ("a"), about 0.1 to 
about 0.8 atomic % Co ("b"), about 12 to about 15 atomic % 
B ("c"), about 2 to about 5 atomic % Si ("d"), and about 1 
to about 3 atomic % C ("e"). The alloys may be annealed at 
a temperature between about 300°C and 400°C. The cooling 
rate is between about 0.5°C/min. and about 75°C/min., with 
about 10°C to about 15°C/min. being most preferred. U.S. 
Patent Nos. 4,219,335, 4,249,969 and 4,298,409 disclose 
alloys with compositions ranging from 80.0 to 82.0 atomic % 
iron ("a"), 12.5 to 14.5 atomic % boron ("c"), 2.5 to 5.0 
atomic % silicon ("d") and 1.5 to 2.5 atomic % carbon. 
Each patent discloses an annealing step at temperatures 
between about 340°C and 385°C, followed by a cooldown at a 
rate of about 0.5°C/min. to about 75°C/min., with a rate of 
about 1°C/min. to about 16°C/min. being preferred. The 
annealing step further reduces core loss and volt-ampere 
demand, making the alloys particularly suitable for use in 
transformer cores. See also U.S. Patents 4,268,325 and 
4,881,989. The present invention is directed to a resonant tag 
comprising a metal strip of a heat treated soft magnetic 
alloy having crystalline and amorphous phases, the alloy 
having a composition of FeaCobBcSidCe wherein 
Mis an element chosen from Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, 
Ta, Cr, Mo and W and mixtures thereof, ais between about 30 and about 85 atomic %; bis between 0 and about 45 atomic %; cis between 0 and about 45 atomic %; dis between about 10 and about 20 atomic %; eis between 0 and about 20 atomic %; fis between 0 and about 10 atomic %; 
with the sum of "d" plus "e" being between 
about 10 and about 30 atomic %;   
 
   the alloy having a saturation magnetostriction of at 
least about 5 ppm, and a resonant voltage output which is 
greater than the resonant voltage output of an essentially 
amorphous alloy having the same composition. Preferably, 
the metal strip having crystalline and amorphous phases is 
obtainable by a process of annealing an amorphous metal 
strip having a saturation magnetostrictive constant of at 
least about 5 ppm at a temperature and for a time 
sufficient to cause partial crystallization of the 
amorphous metal strip, followed by cooling the strip at a 
rate greater than about 10°C/min. Alloys which are 
subjected to this heat
