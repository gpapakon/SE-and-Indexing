<ABSTRACT>
The building has a wooden construction which is made up of wall uprights (1), exterior panels (5), interior panels (3), floor beams (6) and floor panels (13). The interior panels form a shuttering continuing over at least two storeys. The floor beams are guided laterally against the interior panels without penetration. Vertical fixing of the floor beams takes place with metal retainers (8) which, passing through the interior panels with connecting means, are borne by at least one wall upright. An essentially horizontally arranged crossmember (15) is arranged in the region of a corner formed by the interior panels, on the one hand, and the floor beams, on the other hand. A continuous frame is formed by a plurality of successively arranged crossmembers which are screwed to the floor beams and, passing through the interior panels, also to the wall uprights.

Building having a wooden construction formed by wall 
posts, external panels, internal panels, ceiling joists 

and ceiling panels, wherein the internal panels (3) form 
a continuous casing over at least two storeys, wherein 

the ceiling joists (6) laterally adjoin the internal 
panels (3) in a penetration-free manner and are fixed 

vertically by metal supports (8), which penetrate the 
internal panels (3) with connecting means and are carried 

by at least one wall post (1), wherein a substantially 
horizontally disposed cross arm (15) is disposed in the 

region of a corner formed on the one hand by the internal 
panels (3) and on the other hand by the ceiling joist 

(6), and wherein a plurality of successively disposed 

cross arms (15), which are screwed both through the 
ceiling panels (13) to the ceiling joists (6) and through 

the internal panels (3) to the wall posts (1), form a 
closed frame. 
Building according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cross arm (15) is made of wood. 
Building according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the wall posts (1) are disposed at a horizontal distance 

of around 81.5 cm - 83.5 cm. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that ceiling panels (13) extending in a horizontal 

direction are disposed in a vertical direction above the 
ceiling joists (6). 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the cross arms (15) are disposed above the 

ceiling panels (13).  
 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the internal panels (3) are made of a hard wooden 

material. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the external panels (5) are made of a soft wooden 

material. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the metal supports (8) are made of steel. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized 
in that the cross arms (16) have a cross section of 

around 6 cm x 6 cm. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the wall posts (1) have a cross section in the 

region of 6 cm x 14 cm to 6 cm x 18 cm. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the ceiling joists (6) have a cross 

section in the region of 6 cm x 24 cm to 10 cm x 26 cm. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that a roof formed by rafters (18) is 

provided, which in the region of its extension directed 
towards the building interior (2) is lined with ceiling 

panels (13). 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that disposed in a corner region, which 

is delimited on the one hand by the internal panels (3) 
and on the other hand by the ceiling panels (19), is a 

roof cross arm (20) which is screwed both to the wall 
posts (1) and to the rafters (18).  

 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterized in that the roof cross arms (20) in a 

horizontal direction form a closed frame. 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in that an internal casing (16) is disposed 

substantially parallel to the internal panel (13) and 
that a distance of the internal panel (3) from the 

internal casing (16) corresponds to a material thickness 
of the cross arm (15). 
Building according to one of claims 1 to 15, 
characterized in that corner regions of adjoining walls 

are constructed substantially free of wall posts (1).
