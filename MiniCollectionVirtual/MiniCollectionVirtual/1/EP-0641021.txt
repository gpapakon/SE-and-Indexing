<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a method for 
reducing targeting errors that arise when trying to locate 

contaminant particles on a notched semiconductor wafer 
using a high-magnification imaging device, based on 

estimates of wafer feature positions obtained from a 
scanning device. A notched semiconductor wafer is scanned 

(10) with a scanning device to obtain scanning device 
coordinates for the positions of: (i) the wafer center 

(14); (ii) the wafer notch (12); and (iii) contaminant 
particles on the wafer (16). Next, the wafer notch and 

wafer center (20, 26) are found with an imaging device and 
obtains their estimated imaging device coordinates. 

Subsequently, estimated transformation parameters are 
calculated (34) for a coordinate transformation between 

the coordinate systems of the scanning device and the 
imaging device based on the scanning device coordinates 

and the estimated imaging device coordinates of the wafer 
notch and the wafer center. Finally, the scanning device 

coordinates of the particles on the wafer are transformed 
(36) to estimated imaging device coordinates using the 

estimated transformation parameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to techniques for the identification and
analysis of contaminant particles on semiconductor wafers and, more particularly, to
techniques for locating particles on notched wafers when using a high-magnification imaging
device.Semiconductor fabrication technology today deals with wafer sizes up
to 200 mm (millimeters) and feature geometries with dimensions well below 1 µm
(micrometer). The presence of a contaminant particle larger than half the width of a
conductive line on a wafer can lead to failure of a semiconductor chip made from the wafer.
Therefore, a critical task facing semiconductor process engineers is to identify and, as far as
possible, to eliminate sources of surface contamination.Particle analysis on notched silicon wafers consists of locating
contaminant particles on a wafer surface and analyzing their chemical compositions to
determine the source of contamination. A well-known approach is to use a scanning electron
microscope (SEM) in conjunction with an analysis tool such as X-ray spectroscopy to
respectively locate and analyze the particles. Because common particle dimensions are on the
order of 0.1 - 1 µm, however, initial magnifications on the order of 200 times to 2000 times
are required for the particle to be seen on the SEM screen. At these high levels of
magnification, only a small portion of the wafer is visible on the SEM screen at the same
time, and, therefore, particle positions must be known quite accurately before the SEM can
be used. Because the SEM must be operated at high levels of magnification.
It is not a useful instrument to obtain an overview of particles on an entire wafer. Other
devices have been developed for this purpose and a two-stage process for locating and
analyzing particles is generally employed. In the first stage, a laser scanning device raster-scans
the wafer with a laser beam to locate most of the particles on the wafer. An example
of such a device is a Tencor SurfScan 5000, manufactured by Tencor Instruments. The laser
scanner then creates a laser scan map of the coordinates of the wafer features and contaminant
particles. The manner in which the laser beam is scattered from the wafer features and the
particles yields signals from which estimated particle positions in terms of x and y coordinates
can be determined. However, because the scattering mechanism is not completely understood,
the signals are or little help in identifying the type, chemical composition, and possible source
of contaminant particles. This
