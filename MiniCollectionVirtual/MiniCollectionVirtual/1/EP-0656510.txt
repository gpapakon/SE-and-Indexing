<ABSTRACT>
A pocket lighter is disclosed which comprises a measuring chamber 
(21, 125) an inlet valve (19, 20, 117, 120) and an outlet valve (17, 23, 

119, 124), the inlet and outlet valves (19, 20, 117, 120, 17, 23, 119, 
124) being arranged such that opening of the outlet valve (17, 23, 119, 

124) permits fuel to flow from the measuring chamber (21, 125) resulting 
in the inlet valve (19, 20, 117, 120) being closed, and closing of the 

outlet valve (17, 23, 119, 124) results in the inlet valve (19, 20, 117, 
120) being opened to permit fuel to flow into the measuring chamber 

(21, 125).

<DESCRIPTION>
Pocket lighters, for example cigarette lighters commonly comprise a 
reservoir in which liquefied gas fuel is stored under pressure, the gas 
being ignited at a burner nozzle attached to an integral burner valve, in 
use. Ignition occurs when the fuel is permitted to flow beyond the open 
burner valve nozzle connected to the reservoir. In such lighters, the 
supply of fuel to the burner nozzle is only interrupted when the burner 
valve is closed. The continuous burning of fuel through failing to close 
the valve has often caused accidents, for example fires, burns and the 
like. There is concern that misuse of lighters by children may result in a 
large accident. In order to avoid these dangers, a new lighter has been 
developed in which only a fixed and limited quantity of fuel is permitted 
to flow out of the lighter during each use of the lighter, and once the 
fixed quantity is exhausted, the burning terminates, the supply of fuel 
being exhausted. The present invention has been developed in view of these situations. An object of this invention is to provide a lighter, wherein only a fixed 
and limited quantity of gas fuel is supplied for one ignition during valve 
opening. After the quantity is used up the lighter is automatically 
extinguished. According to the present invention there is provided a pocket lighter 
characterised by a measuring chamber an inlet valve and an outlet valve, 
the inlet and outlet valves being arranged such that opening of the outlet 
valve permitting fuel to flow from the measuring chamber results in the 
inlet valve being closed, and closing of the outlet valve results in the  
 
inlet valve being opened to permit fuel to flow into the measuring 
chamber. This invention operates as follows: when an operating lever is actuated, 
a burner nozzle and valve body descend together, closing the inlet valve 
and opening the outlet valve the reverse movement of the lever causing 
the inlet valve to open and the outlet valve to close. The measuring 
space is defined between the inlet and outlet valves, a fixed quantity of 
fuel being held in the measuring space, in use. During actuation of the operating lever, the burner nozzle and the valve 
body are pushed downward simultaneously. When the burner valve 
moves down, the valve member of the inlet valve contacts tightly onto 
the respective valve seat, closing the inlet valve. The valve member of 
the outlet valve is pushed upwards by a bar separating the member from 
the respective valve seat. Accordingly, gas fuel stored in the

A pocket lighter characterised by a measuring chamber (21, 
125) an inlet valve (19, 20, 117, 120) and an outlet valve (17, 23, 119, 

124), the inlet and outlet valves (19, 20, 117, 120, 17, 23, 119, 124) 
being arranged such that opening of the outlet valve (17, 23, 119, 124) 

permitting fuel to flow from the measuring chamber (21, 125) results in 
the inlet valve (19, 20, 117, 120) being closed, and closing of the outlet 

valve (17, 23, 119, 124) results in the inlet valve (19, 20,117,120) 
being opened to permit fuel to flow into the measuring chamber (21, 

125). 
A pocket lighter as claimed in Claim 1, characterised by an 
operating lever (7, 107) for use in operating the pocket lighter. 
A pocket lighter as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterised 
by a movable valve body (12, 112) defining at least part of each of the 

inlet and outlet valves (19, 20, 117, 120, 17, 23, 119, 124). 
A pocket lighter as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that the 
valve body (12, 112) includes a burner nozzle (3, 103). 
A pocket lighter as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4, characterised 
in that downward movement of the valve body (12) results in opening of 

the outlet valve (17, 23) and closing of the inlet valve (19, 20). 
A pocket lighter as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4, characterised 
in that upward movement of the valve body (112) results in opening of 

the outlet valve (119, 124) and closing of the inlet valve (117, 120). 
A pocket lighter as claimed in any one of Claims 4 to 6, 
characterised by an aperture (22) in said burner nozzle (3), and a shutter 

(29) mounted on an upper portion of the burner nozzle (3) for stopping 
emission of gas fuel from the aperture (22), said shutter (29) being 

adapted to move freely from a closing position to an opening position in 
response to operating lever (7) movement. 
A pocket lighter as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 7, 
characterised by a lighter body (1), wherein the operating lever (7) is 

slidably movable in a generally horizontal direction, in use, with respect 
to said lighter body (1), and wherein the operating lever (7) has a thruster 

(28) for forcing the valve body (12) to descend. 
A pocket lighter as claimed in Claim 8, characterised by a 
sparking rasp (6) in plate form which is provided on the operating lever 

(7), said rasp (6) extending in the sliding direction of the lever (7), and 
wherein the rasp (6) moves substantially perpendicularly to a flint (5) for 

producing sparks. 
A pocket lighter as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised by a porous flow regulating member (34, 126) for
