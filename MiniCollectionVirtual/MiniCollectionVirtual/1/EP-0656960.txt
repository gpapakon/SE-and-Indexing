<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a feeding system for electrolytic liquid in a pressurized electrolysis apparatus used for producing hydrogen, in which electrolysis apparatus electrolytic liquid is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen in a pressurized electrolytic cell (11). The feeding system comprises a storage container (40) for electrolytic liquid being at a lower pressure, a pressure-resistant intermediate container (18) connected to a liquid separator (17) of the electrolysis apparatus and a storage container (40), and means (19, 44) for bringing the intermediate container (18) to said lower pressure while filling-in the intermediate container (18) with electrolytic liquid from the storage container (40), and for bringing the intermediate container (18) to the pressure of the liquid separator (17) while emptying the intermediate container (18) to the liquid separator (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a feeding system of electrolysis liquid for a pressurized 
electrolysis apparatus used for producing hydrogen, in which electrolysis 
apparatus electrolytic liquid is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen in a pressurized 
electrolysis cell. Hydrogen is an ideal and non-polluting source of energy in special applications in 
which no conventional energy sources are available. Therefore, for instance in 
devices using electric current and located in sparsely populated and rough regions 
photovoltaic modules can be used for producing the electric current. Such installations 
are frequently unmanned, requiring automatic or remote control operation. 
Also such installations have to be operated when there is no sunlight. Storing 
electricity only in batteries would require a large number of batteries, which are 
heavy in weight and require maintenance. Using hydrogen for storing energy is one of the means to recover the surplus energy 
produced by solar cells, whereby water is decomposed with the aid of electricity into 
hydrogen and oxygen. Thereby, electricity can also be produced, if needed, with the 
aid of a fuel cell from hydrogen. In order to reduce the size of the hydrogen storages 
required, the hydrogen must, however, be pressurized, and additional energy must 
be used in the pressurization. It is known in the art to accomplish the decomposition of water into hydrogen and 
oxygen in electrolytic cells operating under pressure and thus producing hydrogen 
directly in pressurized form, so that no separate compression is needed. However 
increased leakage is a drawback of pressurizing electrolytic cells.  
 It is also known in the art to place an electrolytic cell within a separate pressure 
shell, whereby the differential pressure between the inside and outside of the 
electrolytic cell substantially reduces and the leakages decrease. Thus, in an apparatus 
as for instance in patent publication FR-2466515, the pressure shell is pressurized 
with the aid of nitrogen gas, and the apparatus comprises members for maintaining 
the pressure within the electrolytic cell lower than the pressure of the 
pressure shell. Use of separate pressurizing gas requires, however, use of containers 
for the pressurizing gases, and need for supplementing the pressurizing gas. Thus the 
system disclosed in FR patent No. 2466515 is not suitable for installations operating 
e.g. automatically in remote areas. It is known from GB patent No. 1518234 to place the electrolytic plates inside a 
press
