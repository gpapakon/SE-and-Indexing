An operating mechanism of a multipole electrical circuit breaker, comprising :

a pair of support plates (78, 80) parallel to one another between which the
mechanism (60) is housed,
a toggle (62) formed by a pair of first and second rods (68, 70) articulated on one
another by means of a first pivoting spindle (72),
a switching bar (76) mechanically coupled to the first rod (68), and acting as support
for the movable contacts (24) of all the poles, said bar (76) being mounted in rotation

around a second parallel spindle (112), to perform closing and opening of the
contacts (34, 36, 24),
a tripping hook (82) pivotally mounted between a loaded position and a tripped
position around a third spindle (83) of the support plates (78, 80), and articulated

simultaneously on the second rod (70),
an operating handle (64) securedly united to a base (92) articulated on a fourth fixed
spindle (94) of the support plates (78, 80),
a latch (58) cooperating with an end (84) of the tripping hook (82) to form a
mechanical latching in the loaded position,
a connecting spring (88) secured between the first spindle (72) and the base (92) of
the handle (64),
and a locking lever (96) cooperating with the bar (76) to block the base (92) in an
intermediate position S of the handle (64) when the contacts are welded, said locking

lever (96) being pivotally mounted on a fifth spindle (98) of the support plates (78, 80),
and comprising a stop (102) able to occupy a first active position or a second inactive

position according to the angular position of the bar (76),

characterized in that
 
the locking lever (96) comprises a radiating bearing surface (106) cooperating with a

protuberance (74, 110) of the bar (76) to keep holding the locking lever (96) in the first
active position of the stop (102), during a first part of the opening travel of the

movable contact (24) of each pole, and a notch (105) for receiving said protuberance
(74, 110) causing unblocking of the locking lever (96) to release the base (92) near

the end of the opening travel of the movable contact (24).
The operating mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that the bearing
surface (106) of the locking lever (96) is formed by an arc of a circle centred on the

second spindle (112) of the bar (76), and that the protuberance (74) comprises an
appreciably rounded end (110) cooperating with said bearing surface (106).
The operating mechanism according to claim 1, characterized in that the bearing
surface (106) of the locking lever (96) comprises a flat portion extending appreciably

according to a direction tangent to the protuberance (110) when rotation of the bar
(76) takes place during the first part of the opening travel.
The operating mechanism according to claim 2 or 3, characterized in that the stop
(102) is situated on the locking lever (96) between the bearing surface (106) and the

fifth spindle (98), and that the base (92) is provided with a blocking lug (104) designed
to come into engagement in said intermediate position S of the handle (64) against

the stop (102) which is in the active position.
The operating mechanism according to claim 4, characterized in that the fifth
pivoting spindle (98) of the locking lever (96) is situated between the connecting

spring (88) and the handle (64), extending parallel to the second spindle (112) of the
bar (76).
The operating mechanism according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that the protuberance (74, 110) slides along the radiating bearing surface (106) in the

course of rotation of the bar (76) generating the first part of the opening travel,
unblocking of the locking lever (96) taking place after the handle (64) has passed the

intermediate position S situated between the opening deadpoint PMO and the open
position O. 
The operating mechanism according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the 
locking lever (96) is in the shape of a fork (100), in which said half-open notch
(105) is bounded by the radiating bearing surface (106), and by a tooth (108).
