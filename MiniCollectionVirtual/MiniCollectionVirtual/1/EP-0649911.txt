<ABSTRACT>
Injection lance provided at its exit with a device for distributing a binder-based mineral composition, the device being characterised by the fact:   - that, facing the exit of the lance, it comprises a concave cavity in the form of a crown ring whose axis is coaxial with that of the said lance; - that the said crown ring has a section along the axis of the lance which is substantially M-shaped, the said M-shaped section being made up of four legs converging in pairs at a point or connected to one another by means of a curved line.   The invention also relates to a process for the sealing of components forming a casting hole by means of the lance provided with the abovementioned distributing device.
