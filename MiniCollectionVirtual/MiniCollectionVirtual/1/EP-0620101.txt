<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for lining a branch pipe (21) 
which can achieve an
 air-tight connection between a 
pressure bag (7) and a branch pipe liner bag (1) in a 

simple structure without employing a conventionally 
required sealed tube. An open end of the pressure bag 

(7) is attached to a set nozzle (11) made of a magnetic 
material coupled to a work robot (6) which is movably 

installed in a main pipe (20). A branch pipe liner bag 
(1), impregnated with a thermosetting resin, is placed 

inside the pressure bag (7); the liner bag having a 
flange (5) which includes a magnetic plate (16) so as to 

be magnetically connected to the set nozzle (11) by a 
magnetic force of a magnet (10) provided on the work 

robot. With the flange (5) being closely contacted to 
the inner wall of the main pipe (20) around a branch 

pipe opening (21a), compressed air is supplied into the 
pressure bag (7) to evert and insert the branch pipe 

liner bag (1) into a branch pipe (21). While the branch 
pipe liner bag is pressed against the inner wall of the 

branch pipe, the thermosetting resin impregnated in the 
branch pipe liner bag is cured, whereby the inner wall 

of the branch pipe is lined with the cured thermosetting 
resin, i.e. the branch pipe is repaired. Upon 

completing the lining operation, the magnet (10) is 
turned off, the work robot (6) removed, and the pressure 

bag (7) removed from the branch pipe liner bag (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for
lining a branch pipe by applying a liner bag on the inner wall of the
pipe, and in particular to a method and apparatus for lining a
branch pipe branching off a main pipe.When an underground pipe, such as a pipeline or passageway,
becomes defective or too old to perform properly, the pipe is
repaired and restored without digging the earth to expose the
pipe and disassembling the sections of the pipe. This non-digging
method of repairing an underground pipe has been known and
practiced commonly in the field of civil engineering. Typically,
the method is disclosed by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 60-242038.According to the method described in the above-mentioned
publication, the pipe repair method comprises inserting a
sufficiently long tubular flexible liner bag into the pipe to be
repaired by means of a pressurized fluid, such as air or water. The
tubular liner bag is made of a flexible resin-absorbent material
impregnated with a thermosetting resin, and has its outer surface
covered with an impermeable plastic film.More particularly, according to the publication, the tubular
flexible liner bag is closed at one end and open at the other; the
tubular flexible liner bag is first flattened, then the closed
end of the tubular liner bag is tied to a control rope; the open 
end of the tubular liner bag is made to gape wide and hooked
(anchored) at the end of the defective or old pipe in a manner
such that the wide-opened end of the liner completely and fixedly
covers and closes the pipe end; a portion of the liner is pushed
into the pipe; then, the pressurized fluid is applied to the said
portion of the tubular liner such that the fluid urges the tubular
liner to enter the pipe. Since one end of the tubular liner is
hooked at the end of the pipe, it remains there while the rest of
the flexible liner bag is turned inside out as it proceeds deeper
in the pipe. (Hereinafter, this manner of procedure shall be
called "everting".) When the entire length of the tubular liner
bag is everted (i.e., turned inside out) into the pipe, the
control rope holds the closed end of the tubular liner bag to
thereby control the length of the tubular liner in the pipe.
Then, the everted tubular liner is pressed against the inner wall
of the pipe by the said pressurized fluid, and the tubular flexible
liner is hardened as the thermosetting resin impregnated in the
liner is heated, which is effected by heating the fluid filling
the tubular liner bag by
