<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONElectrophoresis of Nucleic Acid FragmentsField of the InventionThis invention relates to methods and kits for electrophoresis of nucleic acid fragments, particularly those methods and kits useful for electrophoresing nucleic acid fragments contained in a solution which includes glycerol.Background of the InventionFuller, 16 Comments 1989 reports that the presence of glycerol in a sample loaded on an electrophoretic gel may cause artifacts, such as distortion of nucleic acid fragments in DNA sequencing gels. The distortion is said to resemble a bulge in the sequencing gel, and renders the 400-600 nucleotide region of the gel unreadable. Fuller states that because of the distortion caused by the presence of glycerol, United States Biochemical Corpora¬ tion supplies a sequencing enzyme, SEQUENASE Version 2.0 T7 DNA polymerase, at a high enough concentration so that no glycerol distortion occurs when the enzyme is diluted prior to use. Carninci et al. 18 Nucleic Acids Research 204, 1989 describe a standard sequencing gel system using Tris/ Borate/EDTA buffer (TBE) . It also describes a discon¬ tinuous buffer system using Tris-sulphate and Tris-borate. The Tris-sulphate is used as a running gel buffer, and Tris-borate as a tank buffer.Richards, et al., 12 Analytical Biochemistry 452, 1965 and Peacock and Dingman, 6 Biochemistry 1818, 1967 describe electrophoresis of ribonucleic acid in poly- acrylamide gels and resolution of multiple RNA species by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Richards, et al., describe use of Tris-HCl buffer as well as acetic, cacodylic, diethyl barbituric, and glycyl glycine buffers.UBSTITUTESHEET 

Peacock and Dingman describe use of Tris-EDTA and boric acid buffers for electrophoresis. The RNA species are not provided in glycerol-containing samples.Ansorge and Barker, 9 J. Bioc. Biop. Meth. 33, 1984 describe use of Tris/Tricine buffer and an ammediol system for electrophoresis of axam and Gilbert DNA sequencing products. Such products are provided in samples without glycerol.Brumley and Smith, 19 Nuc. Acid. Res. 4121, 1991 describe use of a"borate buffer for a sequencing gel.Summary of the InventionThe present invention concerns use of an electro¬ phoretic buffer, for electrophoresis of nucleic acids, which does not form a chelate complex with glycerol or other reagents. Such complexes, e.g., between boric acid and glycerol, are described by Cotton and Wilkinson, Advanced Inorganic Chemistry, 1980, John Wiley & Sons, p. 298. Other such complexes may be formed between

Claims
1. A method for electrophoresis of nucleic acid fragments present in a solution comprising an amount of a reagent which interacts with boric acid or borate and causes distortion of movement of said nucleic acid fragments in a borate buffered gel, comprising the steps of: applying said solution to an electrophoretic gel and electrophoresing said fragments into said gel in the presence of a buffer lacking boric acid or borate or a derivative thereof which interacts with said reagent and thereby causes distortion of electrophoresis of said fragments.
2. The method of claim 1 wherein said reagent is glycerol.
3. The method of claim 1 wherein said reagent is dithiothreitol.
4. The method of claim 1 wherein said reagent is trehalose.
5. The method of claim 1 wherein said reagent is ethylene glycol.
6. The method of claim 2 wherein said glycerol is provided in an amount greater than or equal to 0.2% in said solution.
7. The method of any of claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 wherein said fragments are produced during an enzymatic DNA sequencing reaction.
8. The method of any of claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 wherein said gel is a DNA sequencing gel. 


 9. The method of claim 7 wherein said reaction is performed in the presence of said glycerol.
10. The method of any of claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 wherein said buffer comprises an acid portion chosen from acetic acid, carbonic acid, glycine, serine, taurine, tricine, and bicine.
11. The method of any of claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 wherein said buffer lacks EDTA.
12. A kit for DNA sequencing comprising reagents necessary for DNA sequencing, and an electrophoretic buffer selected not to form a chelate complex with glycerol.
13. The kit of claim 12 comprising a DNA polymerase in a glycerol solution at a DNA polymerase concentration suitable for use in a DNA sequencing reaction without prior dilution.
14. The kit of claim 13 wherein said concentration of DNA polymerase is between 0.5 and 5 units/μl.
15. The kit of claim 14 wherein said DNA polymerase is T7 DNA polymerase or Taq DNA polymerase.
16. The kit of any of claims 13, 14, or 15 wherein said polymerase is provided within a microtitre well format.
