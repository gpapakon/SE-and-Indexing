<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for the preparation of (cyclo)aliphatic diurethanes from (cyclo)aliphatic diamines, alcohols and urea in a multi-stage reaction, urea being reacted with alcohol with the elimination of ammonia in the first stage, the diamine, optionally in a form dissolved in alcohol, being metered into this reaction mixture in the second stage and being reacted with continuous release of ammonia and finally the reaction mixture being freed from volatile constituents by distillation in a third stage, and the use of the diurethanes obtainable by this process as starting material for the preparation of the corresponding diisocyanates by thermal urethane cleavage.

Process for the preparation of diurethanes of the 
formula (I) 


R-O-CO-NH-R'-NH-CO-O-R
 
with the use as starting materials of diamines of the 

formula (II) 

H
2
N-R'-NH
2
 
alcohols of the formula (III) 


R-OH
 
and urea, wherein 


R
stands for the radical obtained by removing the 
hydroxyl group from a monohydric alcohol having a 

boiling point of less than 180°C at standard 
pressure, and 
R'
stands for a bivalent (cyclo)aliphatic 
hydrocarbon radical having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, 

with the proviso that there are arranged between 
the two nitrogen atoms at least 2 carbon atoms, 
 
characterised in that 


in a first stage urea is reacted with alcohol of the 
formula (III), observing a molar ratio of alcohol to 

urea of at least 1 : 1, at from 150 to 300°C with 
cleavage and removal from the reaction mixture of at  

 
least 10 mol.% ammonia, calculated on the molar 

quantity of urea used, 
in a second stage the diamine of the formula (II), 
optionally in the form of a solution in alcohol of the 

formula (III), is dispensed into the latter reaction 
mixture and is reacted at from 150 to 300°C with 

continuous release of ammonia, and 
finally, in a third stage, volatile constituents are 
removed from the reaction mixture by distillation. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
1,6-hexanediamine, 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexylamine 

or bis(4-aminocyclohexyl) 
methane is used as the diamine of the formula (II). 
Process according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that n-butanol is used as the alcohol of the formula 

(III). 
Use of the diurethanes obtainable according to Claims 
1 to 3 as a starting material for preparing the 

corresponding diisocyanates by thermal cleavage of 
urethane.
