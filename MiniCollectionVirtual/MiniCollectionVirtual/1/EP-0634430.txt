<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of phenolresols for foams, particularly for flower-arranging foams, in which monosaccharides or disaccharides, sugar alcohol or urea-formaldehyde condensation products are added to the starting materials for resol resin preparation. The foams produced in this way are biodegradable, for example during composting.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of foamed material, containing phenolic resin as foam
resin, charcterized in that as phenolic resin resol is used which is modified by addition

of mono- or di-saccharides, sugar alkohols or urea/formaldehyde-condensation
products to the starting material for the resol preparation.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the resol is modified with
glucose, fructose, lactose or sorbitol.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the amount of modifier is
5 to 50% by weight, based on phenol.
A process according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the foaming and curing
of the foam resin is effected at temperatures in the range of 40 to 60Â°C in a twin belt

press.
A biodegradable foamed material produced by a process according to one or several
of the claims 1 to 4.
Use of the biodegradable foamed material according to claim 5 for the production of
foam for the insertion of flowers
