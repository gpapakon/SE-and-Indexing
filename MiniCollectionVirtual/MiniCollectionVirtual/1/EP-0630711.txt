<ABSTRACT>
In the case of an immersion nozzle (1) for pouring molten metal into a mould (8), the throughflow passage (2) widens in the immersion zone (9). In order to ensure that the melt flows into the mould (8) in as uniformly distributed and eddy-free a manner as possible, the throughflow passage (2) has a geometry approximated to the internal cross-section of the mould (8) in the immersion zone (9). The throughflow passage (2) is  provided with a sump-forming chamber (3) between its inlet region (4) and its outlet region (7), this chamber being situated in the vicinity of the immersion zone (9). In the outlet region (7) the geometry of the throughflow passage (2) is approximately the same all the way along as in the immersion zone (9).

<CLAIMS>
Pouring apparatus comprising an immersion nozzle for 
pouring liquid metal, particularly steel, and a mould, 

particularly a thin slab mould, wherein the immersion 
nozzle has a flow control device integrated therein and 

a flow passage (2), which is broadened in the immersion 
zone and which is provided between its inlet region (4) 

and its outlet region (7) with a chamber constituting a 
sump arranged in the vicinity of the immersion zone (9) 

and in its outlet region after the chamber (3) 
constituting the sump, seen in the flow direction, has 

approximately the same area throughout as in the 
immersion zone (9), characterised in that the flow 

control device is constituted by a closure and/or control 
element (15) arranged supported in the immersion nozzle 

(1) within the flow passage (2) and that the flow passage 
(2) has a cross-section in the immersion zone (9) which 

approximates to the internal cross-section of the mould 
(8). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the closure and/or control element 

(15) is constituted by a roller-shaped rotor (16) with a 
radial flow slot (17) arranged in the inlet region (4) or 

in the outlet region (7). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the closure and/or control element 

(15) is constituted by a rotor (19) which is arranged in 
the chamber (3) constituting the sump and which has a 

flat area (20) defining the chamber (3). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in claim 1,  
 

characterised in that the closure and/or control element 
(15) is constituted by an electromagnetic device (22,23). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the cross-sectional area of 

the flow passage (2) in the inlet region (4) is of the 
same size as the cross-sectional area of the flow passage 

(2) in the outlet region (7). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the flow passage (2) has 

approximately the same area in the inlet region (4) as in 
the outlet region (7), particularly in the immersion zone 

(9). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the flow passage (2) has a round 

cross-section in the inlet region (4). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the chamber (3) defines an 

overflow edge (6), following which is the outlet region 
(7). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in claim 7 and 8, 
characterised in that the chamber (3) broadens from the 

aperture (5) of the inlet region (4) to the overflow edge 
(6). 
Pouring apparatus as claimed in claim 8 or 9, 

characterised in that the length of the overflow edge (6) 
is equal to the long side dimension of the outlet region 

(7).
