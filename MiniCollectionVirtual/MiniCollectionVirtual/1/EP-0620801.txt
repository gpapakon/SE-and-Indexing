<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a gantry crane (10), in particular a gantry crane for installation on board ships, with a gantry comprising two parallel cross-beams (18, 20) which form the track for the overhead crane unit. Lateral extension pieces (22, 24, 26, 28) are hinged to the end of each of the cross-beams in such a way that they can be swung out as necessary to lengthen the track. The invention calls for the extension pieces (22, 24, 26, 28) to be designed so that they can swing through 90 DEG  from the position in which they are flush with the cross-beams into the stowed position in which their ends (42, 44, 46, 48) are directed towards the other cross-beams.

<CLAIMS>
A gantry crane, in particular a ship's gantry crane, with a 
gantry that has two cross girders (20, 18) forming the runway for 

a travelling crane whereon there are articulated side parts (22, 
24; 26, 28) which can be respectively folded for the selectable 

extension of the runway, wherein the side parts (22, 24; 26, 28) 
can be folded from the position wherein they are aligned with the 

cross girders (20, 18) through 90Â° into their rest position 
wherein their tips (42, 44; 46, 48) point in the direction towards 

the respective other cross girder (18, 20),
 
characterized in that
 
the cros
s girders (18, 20) are arranged at different levels in 
relation to one another, so that the side parts (22, 24; 26, 28) 

are arranged in their rest position on top of one another. 
A gantry crane according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the travelling crane (30) has wall portions (34, 36) respectively 

carrying the travelling mechanisms which are adapted in their 
height to the height of the cross girders (20, 18) in such a way 

that the travelling crane (30) is arranged substantially horizontally. 
A gantry crane according to one of claims 1 to 2, characterized 
in that a travelling crab (32), which carries an unloading 

arrangement (38), is disposed for displacement on the travelling 
orane (30). 
A gantry crane according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the side parts (22, 24; 26, 28) can be folded hydraulically 

or electrically from their rest position into the position 
wherein they are aligned with the cross girders (20, 18). 
A gantry crane according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the side parts (22, 24; 26, 28) are telescopable.
