<ABSTRACT>
A beverage dispenser (10) as provided for use with a 
container (14) which has an adapter (20) with a resealable 

valve, which is a ball valve (40). The dispenser (10) has a 
valve (22) which includes an engaging mechanism, such as a pin 

(48) for mechanically opening the valve in the adapter. 
Preferably, the dispenser valve (22) has a handle (56) for 

rotatable motion, causing an engaging pin (48) to vertically 
move in contact with the ball valve (40), thus opening the 

container (14) such that its contents can flow. The dispenser 
valve (22) may also be provided with a rinse water conduit (72) 

and an opening (110) so that the user can selectively close the 
adapter valve (20) and rinse the dispenser system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve for use in a beverage 
dispensing device. Concentrated juices, such as orange juice or lemonade, 
may be shipped frozen in a plastic container which is 
disposable or refillable. One type of container which is 
used to ship concentrated juice has a threaded opening onto 
which an adapter with a ball valve is screwed. The adapter 
has a threaded portion at one end, and a reduced diameter 
cylindrical portion with a spring mounted ball valve at the 
end opposite the threaded portion. A dispenser concentrate control valve for a bag-in-box 
type of container is available from Jet Spray Corp. of 
Norwood, Massachusetts, and is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,856,676 and 5,000,348, each of which are assigned to the 
same assignee as the present invention, and each of which are 
expressly incorporated by reference. To install this general type of valve with a container, 
a cap is unscrewed and discarded. The valve has a threaded 
portion or a threaded adapter which can be screwed onto the 
threaded opening of the container. With the adapter and ball 
valve arrangement, the adapter would be discarded, and the 
valve screwed on with its own adapter. A drawback of this arrangement is that a user, such as 
an employee in a restaurant or diner, must remove the adapter 
and add the dispenser valve each time a new container is 
used. Many restaurants have a fast-paced environment so 
restaurant managers do not want to expend any extra time and 
effort replacing food items. Another arrangement that has been used with a ball valve 
includes a stationary pin which contacts the ball valve when 
the container is inserted. With this arrangement, it is 
cumbersome to rinse the system since the flow of juice cannot  
 
be stopped unless the container is removed. This, too, is a 
cumbersome system and is undesirable in the fast-paced food 
service environment. The invention features a beverage dispenser for use with 
a container for holding a concentrated beverage. The 
container has an adapter which is resealably actuable between 
an open position for allowing the beverage to flow from the 
container and a closed position for containing the beverage. 
The dispenser has a housing with a chamber for holding a 
container in a fixed position, and a dispenser valve which 
includes an engaging mechanism for engaging the adapter, and 
a manually actuable switch operable between a first position 
in which the engaging means causes the adapter to be in open 
position and a second position in which

<CLAIMS>
A beverage dispenser for use with a container for 
holding concentrated juice, the container having an adapter 

with a ball valve which is at the bottom of the container 
when the container is inserted in the dispenser, the 

dispenser comprising: 
   a housing having a chamber for holding a container in a 

stationary position when inserted; 
   a dispenser valve mounted in the housing, the dispensor 

valve including: 
   a pin which is vertically actuable to a first 

position in which the pin is spaced from the ball valve so 
that the juice is contained and a second position in which 

the pin engages the ball valve to allow the concentrated 
juice to flow from the container, and 

   a switch for moving the pin between the first and 
second positions; 

   a conduit for providing water from a water supply; 
   means for combining the water and the concentrated 

juice; and 
   a tap for providing the combined water and concentrated 

juice. 
The dispenser of claim 1 further comprising a 
second conduit for providing rinse water to the dispenser 

valve, wherein the dispenser valve has a moveable portion 
with an opening for receiving water into the dispenser valve 

from the second conduit when the opening is aligned with the 
conduit, the opening being aligned when the pin is in the 

first position. 
The dispenser of claim 1 wherein the dispenser 
valve has a stationary outer sleeve with grooves and a 

rotatable inner sleeve with radial pins which mate with the 
 

grooves when the inner sleeve is inserted in the outer 
sleeve, the inner sleeve further comprising a radially 

extending handle. 
The dispenser of claim 2 wherein the dispenser 
valve has a stationary outer sleeve with grooves and a 

rotatable inner sleeve with radial pins which mate with the 
grooves when the inner sleeve is inserted in the outer 

sleeve, the inner sleeve further comprising a radially 
extending handle. 
The dispenser of claim 1 wherein the chamber holds

plurality of dispenser valves and pumps. 
A beverage dispenser for use with a container for 
holding a concentrated beverage, the container having an
