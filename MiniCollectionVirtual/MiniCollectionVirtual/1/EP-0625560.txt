<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to phosphor 
compositions for use in X-ray intensifying screens, and 
X-ray intensifying screens which utilize these 
phosphors. X-ray intensifying screens have in the past 
been used in combination with silver halide containing 
radiographic films to reduce the exposure of patients 
to X-rays. Intensifying screens typically consist of a 
support and a phosphor layer. The phosphor layer, 
which absorbs X-radiation more efficiently than the 
silver halide, is capable of emitting a longer 
wavelength radiation to the adjacent silver halide 
emulsion layer of the radiographic element in an image 
pattern corresponding to that of the X-radiation 
received. The efficiency of absorption of the X-radiation 
by the phosphor is attributable to some 
extent to the density of the phosphor crystals. Higher 
density phosphors absorb radiation more efficiently 
than lighter compositions. One common phosphor 
composition, gadolinium oxy sulfide (Gd2O2S), has a 
density of 7.3 g/cm3. It would be desirable to develop 
a variety of useful phosphor host compounds having 
higher densities, since theoretically, for such 
phosphors thinner intensifying screens could be 
employed, resulting in increased resolution. Several such high density luminescent 
compositions have been decribed. Titanium activated 
hafnium oxide, for example, has a density of 9.7 g/cm3. 
Phosphor compositions of this type are described in 
US-A-4,988,880. Other high density phosphor 
compositions include hafnium germanate and lutetium 
tantalate.  
 In addition, there are a variety of 
intensifying screens, each of which emit different 
wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
Consequently, there is a continuing need for high 
density phosphor compositions which emit at different 
wavelengths. There is also a continuing need for 
phosphors which exhibit improved luminescence 
intensities. We have unexpectedly discovered a particular 
stoichiometry of hafnium stannate that produces a 
crystal structure unlike that of either of the crystal 
structures typically produced for hafnium oxide or tin 
oxide. Whereas hafnium oxide normally has a monoclinic 
crystal structure and tin oxide is normally tetragonal, 
the compositions of the present invention exhibit an 
orthorhombic crystal structure. These compositions 
which result in orthorhombic crystals exhibit excellent 
density and luminescence emission properties. Phosphors of the present invention comprise 
oxygen and elements satisfying the relationship: 
[(Hf1-zZrz)1+xSn
