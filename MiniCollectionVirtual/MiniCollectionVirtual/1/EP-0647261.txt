<ABSTRACT>
Washing and cleaning granules which contain anionic or anionic and non-ionic surfactants in amounts comprised between 5 and 45 % by weight and at least one anionic surfactant consisting of sulphurized fatty acid glycerin ester, suffer no losses in washing power, on the contrary of washing and cleaning granules which contain usual surfactants. The alkylbenzolsulphonates can be totally or at least partially substituted, and even ethoxylated fatty alcohols can be at least partially substituted, for example by 10 to 50 % by weight with respect to the amount of non-ionic surfactants, by the anionic surface-active sulphurized fatty acid glycerin esters. Preferred agents contain as further anionic surfactants alkyl sulphate, mixtures of alkyl sulphate and alkylbenzolsulphonate or are free from alkylbenzolsulphonates.

<CLAIMS>
A granular detergent containing anionic or anionic 
and nonionic surfactants, characterized in that the 

surfactant content of the detergent is 5 to 45% by 
weight, the detergent containing at least one anionic 

surfactant consisting of sulfonated fatty acid glycerol 
esters and inorganic builders selected from zeolites and crystalline layer silicates. 
A granular detergent as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that it contains sulfonated fatty acid glycerol 

esters obtained from fatty acid glycerol esters with 
iodine values below 5, preferably from mono-, di- and 

triglycerides or mixtures thereof with iodine values 
below 5 which contain C
6-22
 fatty acids, by reaction with 
gaseous sulfur trioxide and subsequent neutralization 

with aqueous bases. 
A granular detergent as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the surfactant content of the 

detergent is 5 to 40% by weight and the builder content 
10 to 65% by weight, the detergent containing 2 to 25% by 

weight of sulfonated fatty acid glycerol esters, 1 to 15% 
by weight of nonionic surfactants and zeolite as builder. 
A granular detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that ethoxylated fatty alcohols 

and/or alkyl glycosides are used as nonionic surfactants, 
the content of sulfonated fatty acid glycerol esters in 

the detergent preferably being 5 to 20% by weight and the 
content of nonionic surfactants preferably being 2 to 12% 

by weight. 
A granular detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that it contains other anionic 

surfactants from the group of sulfonates, sulfates and 
soaps. 
A granular detergent as claimed in claim 5, characterized 
in that it contains alkyl benzenesulfonate and/or 

alkyl sulfate, preferably fatty alkyl sulfate, as further  
 

anionic surfactants, the ratio by weight of sulfonated 
fatty acid glycerol ester to alkyl benzenesulfonate 

and/or alkyl sulfate being 1:9 to 4:1 and, more particularly, 
2:5 to 2:1. 
A granular detergent as claimed in claim 1 or 6, 
characterized in that it is free from alkyl benzenesulfonates. 
A granular detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 7, characterized in that it has a zeolite content of 

15 to 40% by weight (based on anhydrous active substance). 
A granular detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 8, characterized in that it contains polycarboxylates, 

preferably citrate, succinate, tartrate, glutarate, 
adipate or mixtures thereof in quantities of 0.5 to 25% 

by weight, preferably 1 to 20% by weight and more preferably 
5 to 15% by weight as organic builders. 
A granular detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 9, characterized in that it contains a mixture of 

sulfonated fatty acid glycerol esters with iodine values 
below 5 and sulfonated unsaturated fatty acid glycerol 

esters in a ratio by weight of 10:1 to 1:1 and preferably 
5:1 to 2:1. 
A granular detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 10, characterized in that it has an apparent density 

of 600 to 1,100 g/l. 
A process for the production of the granular detergent 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, characterized in 

that the granules are produced by spray drying. 
A process for the production of the granular detergent 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, characterized in 

that the granules are produced by a granulation or 
extrusion process. 
A process for the production of the granular detergent 
claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, characterized in  

 
that the sulfonated fatty acid glycerol esters are used 

in the form of a spray-dried or granulated compound 
designed for mixing with other granular constituents of 

detergents.
