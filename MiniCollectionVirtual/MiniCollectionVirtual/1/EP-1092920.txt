<ABSTRACT>
A modular candle holder having first (12) and second (14) components. Each of the two
components includes first and second longitudinal ends (18,20;36,38), with each end having

at least one candle-receiving cavity (28,30;42,44) therein. These cavities are preferably of
different diameters to accept different candle sizes. While the component rests

upon one of these ends, the other may receive a candle. The outer walls of the
two component types are distinctly different, such as generally cylindrical

compared to stepped diameters, to provide different aesthetic impressions. The
longitudinal ends of each component also mate with the other component, or

with like components. As such, one or more of each component type may be
assembled together in various stacked configurations to form a candle holder

having numerous different appearance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to candle holders. In particular, the
present invention relates to an improved candle holder having two modular
pieces which may be arranged in various combinations to hold a candle.Various candle holders are known in the prior art, and generally consist of a
body having at its upper end a cavity to receive and support a candle. This
cavity may be any of various diameters corresponding to standard candle sizes.
A wide range of decorative motifs have been applied in candle holder design,
providing a great diversity in aesthetic appearance.While such prior art candle holders are acceptable, it is preferred that the
holder have a greater range in utility by accepting candles having several
different diameters. Further, it is preferred that the user have greater control
over the aesthetics of the candle holder, and could easily chose among several
variations in design. Yet further, it is preferred that the user be able to readily
change this design to a different design, permitting a greater variety.According to the invention there is provided a modular candle holder,
comprising:
at least one first component having a main body and longitudinally
opposed first and second ends, a first cavity having a first effective diameter
opening on said first end, a second cavity having a second effective diameter
opening on said second end, and a peripheral shoulder on said second end, said
shoulder forming a projection having a size and shape to permit mating with
said first cavity; and at least one second component having a main body and longitudinally
opposed first and second ends, a third cavity having a third effective diameter
opening on said first end of said second component, a fourth cavity having a
fourth effective diameter opening on said second end of said second
component, and a peripheral shoulder on said second end of said second
component, said shoulder forming a projection having a size and shape to
permit mating with said second cavity of said first component, whereby said
first and second components may be stacked vertically in various combinations
with said mating of said projections and cavities.Thus, embodiments of the invention have first and second components, each of
which components has a respective candle-receiving cavity at each end of the
component. These cavities are preferably of different diameters to accept
different candle sizes. While the component rests upon one of these ends, the
other end may receive a candle. The outer walls of the two

<CLAIMS>
A modular candle holder, comprising:

at least one first component (12) having a main body (16) and
longitudinally opposed first (18) and second (20) ends, a first cavity (28)

having a first effective diameter (D2), opening on said first end (18), a second
cavity (30) having a second effective diameter (D3) opening on said second end

(20), and a peripheral shoulder (32) on said second end, said shoulder (32)
forming a projection having a size and shape to permit mating with said first

cavity (28); and
at least one second component (14) having a main body (34) and
longitudinally opposed first (36) and second (38) ends, a third cavity (42)

having a third effective diameter (D4) opening on said first end of said second
component (14), a fourth cavity (44) having a fourth effective diameter (D5)

opening on said second end (38) of said second component, and a peripheral

shoulder (46) on said second end (38) of said second component, said shoulder
(46) forming a projection having a size and shape to permit mating with said

second cavity (30) of said first component, whereby said first (12) and second
(14) components may be stacked vertically in various combinations with said

mating of said projections and cavities.
A modular candle holder as in claim 1, wherein said first end (18) of
said first component (12) is sized and shaped to permit receipt within said third

cavity (42), and said second end (38) of said second component is sized and
shaped to permit receipt within said third cavity (42).
A modular candle holder as in claim 2, further comprising a fifth cavity
(24) in the or each said first component, opening onto said first cavity (28)

thereof.
