<ABSTRACT>
An electronic device (100) has a heatsink (116) and 
electrical contacts (120) which are originally all part of a 

support frame (200). After assembly, the border of the support 
frame (202) is broken off, thereby electrically isolating the 

electrical contacts (120) from one another, and from the 
heatsink (116). The electrical contacts (120) and the heatsink 

(116) are coplanar. In one version, the electrical contacts 
(120) do not extend past the circuit board (102) of the device 

(100).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic devices, and more
particularly to electronic devices having coplanar heatsinks and electrical
contacts.In the past, electronic devices such as radio frequency (RF) amplifiers
have been packaged in configuration with formed leads providing electrical
contact to the RF amplifier. The formed leads have typically been gullwing-shaped.
Furthermore, a heatsink slug has typically been attached to the
bottom of the package in the clearance area provided by the bend of the
gullwing. Conventional assembly techniques require that all of the gullwing
leads and the plane of the heatsink be coplanar, within very strict tolerances.
Consequently, the gullwing leads often require manual adjusting in order to
make them coplanar with one another and with the heatsink slug attached to
the package. An additional disadvantage arises in that during shipping the
leads may be bent out of the required planarity and become unacceptable to
the customer.Examples of conventional assembly techniques can be found in the
following patent documents, EP-A-0 588 651, US-A-5 179 039, US-A-4 835
598, and US-A-3 958 075, which describe a printed wiring board having a
bottom board surface and a top board surface, a metal heatsink disposed on
the bottom board surface, and a plurality of electrical contacts disposed on the
bottom board surface wherein the contacts are coplanar with the metal
heatsink. European patent application EP-A-0 588 651 is prior art for this
application under the terms of Article 54(3) EPC.Consequently, what is needed is an electronic device which does not
require preformed leads. Furthermore, it would be desirable if the electrical
contacts of the device did not require adjustment for planarity with other 
respective electrical contacts and the heatsink of the device. Furthermore, it
would be desirable if the electrical contacts of 
the device were not susceptible to bending during shipment and
other handling.FIG. 1 is a simplified cross section view of an electronic
device;FIG. 2 is a bottom view of an electronic device;
andFIG. 3 is a simplified cross section view of an electronic
device in accordance with the
present invention.Generally stated, the present invention comprises an
electronic device having coplanar heatsink and electrical
contacts. More specifically, one embodiment of the present
invention comprises a printed wire board, populated with
components, attached to a support frame. The support frame
includes both the heatsink and electrical contacts for the
device.
