<DESCRIPTION>
Throughout this application various publications are
referred to by partial citations within parenthesis.
Full citations for these publications may be found at
the end of the specification immediately preceding the
claims. The disclosures of these publications, in
their entireties, are hereby incorporated by reference
into this application in order to more fully describe
the state of the art to which this invention pertains.The subject invention of this application, DNA encoding
a human serotonin receptor (5-HT4B) and uses thereof,
refers to the "5-HT4B receptor" which has been renamed
to the "5-HT7 receptor" by the "Serotonin Receptor
Nomenclature Committee" of the IUPHAR. Thus, all
claims herein directly or indirectly related to the 5-HT4B
receptor and nucleic acid molecules encoding the 5-HT4B
receptor are drawn to the 5-HT7 receptor and
nucleic acid molecules encoding the 5-HT7, receptor
also.Primary amino acid sequence and signal transduction
data are now published for four cloned 5-HT1-like
receptors, three cloned 5-HT2 receptors, and one 5-HT3
receptor. Analysis of the sequence homology as well as
the signal transduction pathways of these receptors
leads to their grouping on the basis of these
attributes: The 5-HT1 subfamily includes: 5-HT1A
(Fargin, 1988; Kobilka, 1989), 5-HT1B/5-HT1Dβ (Weinshank
et al., 1991 and the rest), 5-HT1Dα (Branchek et al.
1991; Hamblin and Metcalf, 1991; Weinshank et al.,
1992), 5-HT1E (Levy et al., 1992; McAllister et al., 
1992, Zgombick et al., 1992) and 5-HT1F (Adham et al,
1993). These subtypes share > 50% transmembrane amino
acid identity and couple to the inhibition of adenylate
cyclase. The 5-HT2 family includes the 5-HT2 receptor
(Pritchett et al., 1988), 5-HT1C (Julius et al., 1989)
and 5-HT2F (Rat Stomach Fundus; Foquet et al., 1992;
Kursar et al., 1992). These receptors share > 70%
amino acid identity and coupling to phosphoinositide
hydrolysis. The 5-HT3 receptor has been shown to be a
ligand-gated ion channel (Maricq et al., 1991).
Heterogeneity of 5-HT3 receptors is controversial,
although other ligand-gated ion channels display
significant heterogeneity. Notably absent from this
series are the 5-HT4 receptors. The second messenger
coupling from tissue studies indicates activation of
adenylate cyclase as a primary mode of signal
transduction (Dumius et al., 1988; Bockaert et al.,
1990). We report here the cloning of the first
mammalian 5-HT receptor that couples to the stimulation
of adenylate cyclase activity which we propose to name
5-HT4B. The
