<ABSTRACT>
An internal check valve for use in a linear hydraulic motor 
in the form of a piston-cylinder unit including a cylinder body 

(38) reciprocally slidable on a piston component (40). The 
piston component (40) includes a tubular piston rod (52) and 

a piston head (60) defining first and second working chambers 
(136, 140) within the cylinder body (38). The tubular piston 

rod (52) includes a center tube (102) located within the piston 
rod (52). The center tube (102) provides a fluid passageway 

(134) through its center which communicates with a first 
working chamber (136). An annular second passageway (142) is 

formed by and radially between the piston rod (52) and the 
center tube (102). A spring biased check valve (116) is 

positioned within the piston rod (52, 54) and is operatively 
connected with one of the passageways (134, 126, 130). The 

check valve (116) has a valve member displaceable from a valve 
seat (120) by hydraulic pressure to overcome the spring bias 

(122, 124) and allow flow in one direction. The center tube 
(102) is axially displaceable relative to the piston rod (52). 

Displacement is effected by end of stroke movement of the 
cylinder body (38) and displacement of the center tube (102) 

causes displacement of the valve member (116) to mechanically 
open the check valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal 
check valve for a linear hydraulic motor. More 
particularly, it relates to the provision of a check 
valve which may be mechanically displaced at the end of 
stroke in one direction. From US-A-5,125,502 a check valve as defined in 
the preamble of claim 1 is known. It is well known that linear hydraulic motors 
can be sequentially or otherwise controlled by check 
valves which are displaced by end of stroke movement. 
Typically, such check valves are mounted externally and 
are actuated by a dog or actuation member extending from 
either the piston, the cylinder, or some member which is 
moved as a result of movement of either the piston or 
cylinder. Externally-located check valves of this type 
are exposed to hazards and adverse environmental 
conditions. External connections between such check 
valves are also subject to damage and multiply the 
opportunity for leakage and failure. The object of the invention is to obviate the 
above disadvantages. This is achieved according to the 
invention by the features as defined in the 
characterizing part of claim 1. The present invention provides a check valve 
which is positionable internally of a linear hydraulic 
motor. A piston-cylinder unit includes a cylinder body  
 
reciprocally slidable on a piston component. The piston 
component includes tubular piston rod and a piston head 
defining first and second working chambers within the 
cylinder body. The tubular piston rod includes a center 
tube located within the piston rod. The center tube 
provides a fluid passageway through its center which 
communicates with a first working chamber and an annular 
second passageway is formed by and radially between the 
piston rod and the center tube. A spring biased check 
valve is positioned within the piston rod and operatively 
connected with one of the passageways. The check valve 
has a valve member displaceable from a valve seat by 
hydraulic pressure to  
 
overcome the spring bias and allow flow in one direction. The 
center tube is axially displaceable relative to the piston rod. 
Displacement is effected by end of stroke movement of the 
cylinder body and such displacement of the center tube causes 
displacement of the valve member to mechanically open the check 
valve. Other aspects, features and advantages of the present 
invention are seen in the following description of the best 
mode of carrying out the invention, claims and attached 
drawings, all of which are incorporated herein as a disclosure 
of

<CLAIMS>
Internal check valve for use in a linear 
hydraulic motor, comprising: 


a piston-cylinder unit including a cylinder 
body (38) reciprocally slidable on a piston component 

(40), said piston component (40) including a tubular 
piston rod (52) and a piston head (60) defining first 

(136) and second (140) working chambers within said 
cylinder body (38); 
said tubular piston rod (52) including a center 
tube (102) located within the piston rod, said center 

tube (102) providing a fluid passageway (134) through its 
center which communicates with the first working chamber 

(136), and an annular second passageway (142) being 
formed by and radially between the piston rod (52) and 

the center tube (102), the second passageway (142) 
providing fluid communication with the second working 

chamber (140), characterized by 
a spring biased check valve positioned within 
said piston rod (52) and operatively connected with one 

of said passageways, said spring biased check valve 
having a valve member (116) displaceable from a valve 

seat (120) by hydraulic pressure to overcome said spring 
bias (122, 124) and allow flow in one direction; and 
wherein said center tube (102) is axially 
displaceable relative to said piston rod (52),
 
displacement being effected by end of stroke movement of 

said cylinder body (38), and such displacement of said 
center tube (102) causing displacement of said valve 

member (116) to mechanically open said spring biased 
check valve. 
Internal check valve of claim 1, wherein the 
piston rod (52) includes a first port (126), a second 

port (128), and a third port (130), the first port in  
 

fluid communication with the fluid passageway (134) in 
the center tube (102) and the first working chamber

the annular second passageway (142) and the second 

working chamber (140), the third port in fluid 
communication with the first port (126), wherein the

wherein the valve member (116) slides axially along a 

reduced diameter portion of the center tube (102), and

center tube is axially displaced by end of stroke 

movement of the cylinder body, to unseat the valve 
member. 
Internal check valve of any of claims 1-4, 
wherein the center tube (102) has a projection (110) that 

projects into the first working chamber (136) and that 
contacts an end wall (44) of said cylinder body (38),
