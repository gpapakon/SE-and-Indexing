<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a case (10) for the remote control of an electrical installation, of the type comprising a case body (12, 14), the wall (26) of which delimits an internal receptacle (18) provided for receiving various components, and of the type comprising at least one control button (30) which extends through an orifice (28) formed in a portion of the wall (26) of the case and on which a user can exert a controlling pressure force in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane of this portion of the wall (26) of the case, counter to elastic means for returning the button into the released position, characterised in that the button consists of a plate (30), the contour (32) of which is substantially complementary to that (34) of the said orifice (28), to the edge of which it is connected by means of a plastic film (42, 44).

<CLAIMS>
Remote-control unit for an electrical installation,
of the type including a housing body (12, 14),

the wall (26) of which delimits an internal housing
(18) intended to accommodate various components, and of

the type including at least one control button (30)
which extends through an aperture (28) formed in a portion

of the wall (26) of the unit and on which a user
can exert a control-pressure force along a direction

substantially perpendicular to the plane of this portion
of the wall (26) of the unit, counter to elastic

means for returning the button into the released position,

characterised in that
 the button consists of a
plate (30), the contour (32) of which is substantially

complementary to that (34) of the said aperture (28) to
the edge of which it is linked by a plastic film (42,

44) forming the elastic return means.
Control unit according to Claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the plastic film (42) extends over at least a
portion of the inner face (40) of the plate (30) and

over at least a part of the portion of the inner face
(38) of the wall (26) of the housing which surrounds

the said aperture (28).
Control unit according to one of Claims 1 and 2,

characterised in that
 the film (42) is produced by
overmoulding simultaneously on the inner face (40) of

the plate (30) and on the inner face (38) of the wall
(26) of the housing.
Control unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the portion (44) of
the film (42) which extends between the facing edges

(32, 34) of the plate (30) and of the aperture (28) exhibits
a circular-arc shape, in cross section.
Control unit according to Claim 4, 
characterised
in that
 the said portion (44) of the film features, in 
cross section, a semi-circular shape the convexity of

which is turned towards the inside (18) of the housing.
Control unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the wall (26) of the
housing is produced by moulding from plastic.
Control unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the button-forming
plate is produced by moulding from plastic.
Control unit according to Claims 6 and 7 taken
in combination, 
characterised in that
 the button-forming
plate (30) is produced by moulding simultaneously

with the wall (26) of the housing to which it is
linked by at least one linking tab (36) which is elastically

deformable and produced from the same material,
by moulding, with the plate (30) and the wall (26) of

the housing.
Control unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the wall of the housing
includes a window (46), especially for infrared

waves to pass through, and 
in that
 the film (42) extends
opposite the window (46) in order to ensure the

leaktightness of the housing.
Control unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the film (42) is produced
from polyamide.
Installation for electric locking of the doors
of a motor vehicle, 
characterised in that
 it includes a
control unit produced in accordance with any one of the

preceding claims.
