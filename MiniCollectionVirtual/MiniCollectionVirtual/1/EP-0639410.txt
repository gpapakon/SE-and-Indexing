<ABSTRACT>
In particular for the dismantling of equipment assembled from a plurality of individual parts, the fractionation of the product takes place by mechanical movements of product parts and/or the use of technology on product parts. According to the invention, it is envisaged that individual dismantling steps and different use of technology are defined, that each dismantling step and use of technology is assigned a significance and that individual dismantling steps of the same significance are grouped together to form evaluation groups and from this a reference curve for the dismantling operation of the product or of a product group is predetermined. By means of the comparison of the actual curves of product variants with the reference curve, an objective evaluation of the dismantling suitability is possible. The recycling costs arising after the end of the service life of a product can thus be minimised.

Method of developing products or product groups
designed for convenience of dismantling, in particular of

equipment composed of a plurality of single parts, which
is to be taken apart by mechanical movements of product

parts and/or the use of technology on product parts at
the end of the service life,


in which the convenience of dismantling of different
variants of the products or product groups is determined

and compared to choose the variant which is most
convenient for dismantling,
the determination of the convenience of dismantling of
each variant being carried out in each case in such a way

that individual dismantling steps and different measures
are defined as use of technology, that a ranking is

assigned to each dismantling step and/or use of
technology, and that individual dismantling steps and/or

use of technology of equal ranking are combined to form
valuation groups and, from these, a reference curve for

the dismantling operation of the product or of a product
group is stipulated,
at least the following types of mechanical movement of
product parts being specified as dismantling steps:


vertical movement straight upwards
horizontal movement
movement obliquely upwards
vertical movement downwards
movement obliquely downwards
circular movement,
and the following measures being specified as use of 
technology on product parts:


deformation, bending open
can only be dismantled using force
can only be dismantled using heat
can be dismantled with use of simple tools
can be dismantled by machine processing
undetachable connection.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the sequence of the dismantling steps is taken into

account as an influencing parameter on the reference
curve.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that an actual curve is determined for a given product or

product group, and in that, by comparing the actual curve
and the reference curve, statements can be derived on the

convenience of dismantling of the product and/or the
associated dismantling costs.
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in
that summated valuation figures are determined from the

actual and reference curves of all the dismantling steps
for a given product or product group, the convenience of

dismantling of the product or product group resulting
from comparing the total valuation figures of the actual

and reference states.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the individual dismantling steps and/or the

different use of technology are illustrated by significant
symbols for a summarized valuation.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that dismantling steps with use of technology are

interpreted as dismantling movement with dismantling
difficulty.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that dismantling steps with mechanical movements and use

of technology are combined to form functional terms such
as, for example, snap-in closure, rotary closure or the

like.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that dismantling steps with mechanical movements and use

of technology are combined to form functional terms in
valuation groups, for example five valuation groups.
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the dismantling movements recorded and the features

defined for dismantling difficulties are weighted and
given a points value.
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in
that the reference curve for the dismantling of products

ranges from a high value for the first valuation group to
low values for high valuation groups, for example zero

for the last valuation group.
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in
that the proportions of the individual valuation groups

from the total assembly are, for example, about 70% for
the first valuation group, 20% for the second valuation

group, 10% for the third valuation group 3 and 0% for the
further valuation groups.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that, to determine the costs for dismantling

comparable products or product groups, the
surfaces covered by the actual curves in relation to the

reference curve are compared.
Method according to Claim 12, characterized in
that a determination of minimum costs for dismantling

comparable products is carried out by computer-controlled
summation and comparison of the points values.
