<ABSTRACT>
In order to prevent leaking out of ink from the perforated portion 
over the non-perforated stencil sheet leading end mounting portion of 

the stencil printing drum, in the construction that a printing drum 
cooperates with a back press roller or a transfer roller with a 

transverse bar portion of the printing drum is received in a transfer 
groove of the back press roller or the transfer roller, the outer 

circumferential length of the perforated portion of the printing drum 
and the transverse groove of the back press roller or the transfer 

roller and the relative rotation phase therebetween are so determined 
that the perforated portion is not laid one over the other with the 

transfer groove.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stencil printer, and more
particularly to a construction for preventing ink leakage from the
printing drum of the stencil printer.A known stencil printer comprising a printing drum having a perforated
construction at a circumferential portion thereof excluding two annular
edge portions extending along opposite axial ends of a cylindrical
configuration thereof and a strip-like stencil sheet leading end mounting
portion extending between said two annular edge portions along a
generatrix of said cylindrical configuration, and a back press roller
having a transverse groove at an outer circumferential portion extending
along a generatrix thereof, said printing drum and said back press
roller being arranged to be close to and in parallel with one another so
as to be rotated in mutually opposite rotational directions in
synchronization with said stencil sheet leading end mounting portion
aligning with said transverse groove such that a stencil sheet wrapped
around said printing drum applies a stencil printing to a print sheet fed
between said printing drum and said back press roller with ink
supplied through said perforated portion of said printing drum is shown
in Japanese Patent Application 63-28553 (JP-A-1-204781),
Japanese Patent Application 1-47029 (JP-A-2-225078),
Japanese Patent Application 2-223550 ( JP-A- 4-105984)
and others.It is an object of the present invention to improve the stencil
printer of the above-mentioned basic construction for carrying out a
stencil printing by a stencil sheet trapped around the printing drum
with the ink supplied through the perforated portion of the printing
drum so as to definitely prevent ink leakage from the printing drum.According to the present invention, the above-mentioned object is
accomplished by the features of claim 1 and 2, respectively. The stencil printer having the above-mentioned
basic construction is constructed such that the circumferential length of 
each of said perforated portion of said printing drum and said
transverse groove of said back press roller and the relative rotation
phase between said perforated portion and said transverse groove are
so determined that said perforated portion is not laid one over the
other with said transverse groove. Further, in the case of a stencil
printer wherein a transfer roller is interposed between the printing
drum and the back press - roller so that a printing image is applied onto
the transfer roller by a stencil sheet wrapped around the printing drum
with ink supplied

<CLAIMS>
A stencil printer comprising:

a printing drum (10) having a perforated construction at a
circumferential portion thereof excluding two annular edge portions (16)

extending along opposite axial ends of a cylindrical configuration thereof and a
strip-like stencil sheet leading end mounting portion (10a) extending between

said two annular edge portions along a generatrix of said cylindrical
configuration, and
a back press roller (14) having a diameter which is either the same as that
of said printing drum or two or higher integer times of that of said printing drum

and having correspondingly either a single transverse groove (22) or said integer
number of transverse grooves (22) at an outer circumferential portion or portions

extending along a generatrix or generatrices thereof,
said printing drum (10) and said back press roller (14) being arranged to
be close to and in parallel with one another so as to be rotated in mutually

opposite rotational directions in synchronization, with said stencil sheet leading
end mounting portion (10a) aligning with said transverse groove (22) or grooves

(22) such that a stencil sheet (19) wrapped around said printing drum applies a
stencil printing to a print sheet (S) fed between said printing drum (10) and said

back press roller (14) with ink supplied through said perforated portion (20c) of
said printing drum,
said printing drum (10) and said back press roller (14) being further
relatively shiftable with respect to relative rotational position therebetween from

a standard relative position where said stencil sheet leading end mounting
portion (10a) of said printing drum and said single transverse groove (22) or each

of said plurality of transverse grooves (22) of said back press roller are
substantially aligned with one another to a first relative position in a first 

relative rotational direction for a first relative angle which expands a first
arcuate biasing range along the circumference of said back press roller and to a

second relative position in a second relative rotational direction opposite to
said first relative rotational direction for a second relative angle which expands a

second arcuate biasing range along the circumference of said back press roller,

   wherein the sum of the circumferential length (P) of said
perforated portion (20c) of said printing drum and said first and second arcuate

biasing ranges (38, 40) is smaller than the circumferential length of a part of
said back press roller (14) having said single transverse groove (22) excluding

said transverse groove (22) or the circumferential length of a part of said back
press roller having the plurality of transverse grooves (22) extending between

each two adjacent transverse grooves (22).
A stencil printer comprising:

a printing drum (10) having a perforated construction at a
circumferential portion thereof excluding two annular edge portions (16)

strip-like stencil sheet leading end mounting portion (10a) extending between

said two annular edge portions along a generatrix of said cylindrical
configuration,
a transfer roller (44) having a diameter which is the same as that of said
printing drum and having a transverse groove (22) at a circumferential portion

thereof along a generatrix thereof, and
a back press roller (14),
said printing drum (10) and said transfer roller (44) being arranged to be
close to and in parallel with one another with said stencil sheet leading end

mounting portion (10a) aligning with said transverse groove (22) so as to be
rotated in mutually opposite rotational directions in synchronization, while said

transfer roller (44) and said back press roller (14) are arranged to be close to and 
in parallel with one another so as to be rotated in mutually opposite rotational

directions in synchronization, such that a stencil sheet (19) wrapped around said
printing drum (10) applies an ink image onto said transfer roller (44) by ink

supplied through said perforated portion (20c) of said printing drum (10), while
said ink image on said transfer roller (44) is transferred onto a print sheet (S) fed

between said transfer roller (44) and said back press roller (14),
said printing drum (10) and said transfer roller (44) being further
relatively shiftable with respect to relative rotational position therebetween from

a standard relative position where said stencil sheet leading end mounting
portion (10a) of said printing drum and said transverse groove (22) of said

transfer roller are substantially aligned with one another to a first relative
position in a first relative rotational direction for a first relative angle which

expands a first arcuate biasing range along the circumference of said transfer
roller and to a second relative position in a second relative rotational

direction opposite to said first relative rotational direction for a second relative

printing drum (10).
A stencil printer according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the supply of ink through
said perforated portion (20c) of said printing drum (10) is substantially energized 

by oozing out of ink from said perforated portion (20c) due to a compression
applied thereto.
A stencil printer according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the supply of ink through
said perforated portion (20c) of said printing drum (10) is substantially energized
