<ABSTRACT>
A high rate, continuous production, slush hydrogen 
generator includes a tank (100), apparatus (20) for creating 

a vacuum in the 
tank, apparatus (210) for delivering triple point (T.P.) liquid 

hydrogen (LH2) to the tank, apparatus for interacting with the 
vacuum in the tank to produce slush hydrogen from the T.P. LH2, 

where the T.P. LH2 has a substantially constant solid fraction, 
and apparatus (114) for delivering cold vapors from the slush in the 

tank to the vacuum creating apparatus. The apparatus for 
producing slush hydrogen in the generator includes a perforated 

spray ring (216) for evaporating the T.P. LH2 and apparatus (210,212) 
for delivering the LH2 under pressure to the spray ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process
for producing slush hydrogen
continuously and at a
high rate of production. One of the principal objectives of aerospace research
today is to develop a long range, hypersonic space vehicle which
can journey from the earth to various points in outer space.
Recently, vehicles of this type have originated from work under
the National AeroSpace Plane (NASP) program. Some of the
requirements of these vehicles include high density, low volume
fuel; high speed travel (hypersonic range); relative light
weight; and relatively large payloads. Fuels for these vehicles
which have been considered include slush fuels, such as slush
hydrogen.The production of slush hydrogen (SH2) is currently
accomplished by means of a "freeze/thaw" process. For the
freeze/thaw process, the pressure in a container of liquid
hydrogen (LH2) is progressively reduced by a vacuum pump. The
resulting evaporation of hydrogen reduces the bulk temperature to
the saturation temperature corresponding to the ullage pressure.
The ullage pressure will be reduced to the triple-point (T.P.)
pressure of 1.02 PSIA. After the triple-point pressure is reached, further
evaporation of hydrogen will convert part of the triple-point
liquid to solid hydrogen. If the pressure is continuously
maintained at the triple-point pressure, the frozen hydrogen will
form as a solid sheet at the surface and ultimately suppress any
further freezing action. Removing vapor at a low rate is also
conducive to forming a solid sheet at the surface. Removing
vapor at a high rate causes violent boiling and eruption of the
bulk hydrogen, resulting in a large carry-over of liquid hydrogen
droplets with the vapor flow.Tests performed in the 1960's at the Bureau of Standards
Cryogenics Laboratory showed that the optimum vapor withdrawal
rate to minimize liquid hydrogen carry-over was approximately 48.7 m3/min per square meter of liquid surface area (160
CFM of vapor per square foot of liquid surface area). This flow
rate was referenced to the vacuum pump inlet, and the inlet vapor
had to be heated (approx. 278 K (500° R, 40°F)) because of vacuum pump
mechanical limitations. The corresponding volumetric withdrawal
rate at the liquid surface (approx. 13.8 K (24.8 R)) was less by a factor
of approximately 20, or 2.44 m3/min per square meter of surface area (8 CFM per square foot of surface area). To eliminate the formation of a solid sheet of hydrogen
at the surface, the vacuum level is cycled above and below the
triple-point pressure. During
