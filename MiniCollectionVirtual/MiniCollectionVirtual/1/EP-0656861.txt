<ABSTRACT>
Means for holding the bottoms of petaloid shaped bottles (B) in place in a wrap-around carrier. Side panel apertures include flaps (70) connected to the side panel (34) by fold lines (64) which are inwardly curved at their upper portions. The lower portions of each pair of flaps extend toward each other so as to engage one or more support feet of the adjacent bottle and be forced out from the side panel (34) thereby. The curved portion of the fold lines biases the flaps against the support feet, regardless of which portion of the feet engage the flaps, to assist in holding the bottles in place within the carrier. Fold lines (76) extending from the flap edges to the flap fold lines and hook-shaped slits (80) at the upper ends of the flaps allow the side flaps to flex lengthwise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wrap-around carrier
package according to the preamble of claim 1. It
furthermore relates to a carrier blank as defined in
the preamble of claim 12. In general the present
invention deals with carriers which contain heel
cutouts or apertures for holding the bottom portions of
adjacent articles in place.Wrap-around carriers are normally designed to
accommodate the size and shape of the particular
article to be packaged. In the case of beverage
bottles, cutouts are conventionally provided in the
side panels to allow the bottom or heel portion of the
bottles to extend out beyond the side panel. Contact
between the side edges of the cutouts and the bottles
holds the lower portions of the bottles in place within
the carrier to prevent the bottles from moving and
falling out of the package. Instead of simple cutouts
apertures may be provided that are partially covered by
opposed side flaps each connected to the side panel by
a fold line. A carrier of this design is disclosed in
US-A-4373630 representing the closest prior art. This
prior art carrier as others is designed for
conventionally shaped bottles that have bottom portions
which are circular in cross section. For these bottles
the relationship between the bottle and the cutout and
the aperture respectively remains the same regardless
of which portion of the bottle is facing toward the
cutout/the aperture. The orientation of the bottles
within the carrier at the time of packaging and during
shipping is therefore not a consideration in designing
the cutouts and apertures respectively. A problem arises when the bottle heels have
varying contours of irregular shape. One such type of
beverage bottle is formed of plastic and has a
decorative bottom portion of petaloid shape. These
bottles have support feet which are regularly spaced
from each other about the periphery of the bottle. The
sides of the support feet as well as the lower surface
of the feet terminate at a point near the center of the
bottom of the bottle, which is slightly higher than the
bottom support surfaces of the feet. Thus when one
views the bottom of the bottle, as in a plan view, the
appearance of the bottom face is petaloid in nature,
with the center area appearing to form the center of a
flower and the support feet the petals.Since the heel portions of petaloid bottles are
not uniform, being broken up by the spaced support
feet, the normal rotation of the bottles as they are
moved into place for packaging makes it impossible to
predict the exact portion of the

least some of the side flaps being outwardly pivoted

thereby;
flex enhancing fold lines (76) extending from
the outer side edge portion (74) of each of the side

flaps (70) to the side flap fold lines (64), said flex
enhancing fold lines acting to enhance the ability of 

the side flaps to flex along the length of said side
flaps;
the side flap fold lines (64) of each aperture
including straight lower portions (66) extending up to

the curved fold line portions (68) along diverging
paths; and
the outer side edge portions (74) of the side
flaps (70) associated with each aperture include lower

portions which are spaced apart from one another a
lesser amount than higher portions.
A wrap-around carrier package according
to claim 1, wherein the flex enhancing fold lines

comprise a plurality of converging fold lines (76)
extending from the outer side edge (74) of each side

flap (70) to a point on the side flap fold lines (64).
