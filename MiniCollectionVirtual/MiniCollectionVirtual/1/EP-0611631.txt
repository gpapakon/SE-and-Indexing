<ABSTRACT>
In or on the floor plate (5) a distance holder is fitted under the magazine (4). A stop (1) in its entirety or partly is formed a spacer under the magazine. The stop is rotatably located around its location point (2), being rotatable through 45 deg. in both directions. For the stop in its turned end position, arresting points for position securement are provided. Each side of the stop is provided with a locating surface (3).

Block stapler for thicker stacks of stock to be stapled, 
comprising an abutment (1) for fixing the depth of the stapling from 

the edge of the stock to be stapled, wherein the abutment is mounted 
in the base plate (5) to be displaceable in longitudinal direction, 

wherein an ejector channel (6) is arranged at the end of a magazine 
(4) serving for reception of the stapling means, and wherein a 

constrainedly guided range spacer to be brought under the magazine is 
arranged in or on the base plate, characterised thereby that the 

abutment (1) is mounted to be rotatable about its respective bearing 
point (2). 
Block stapler according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the abutment (1) is constructed in entirety or partially as a range 

spacer able to be brought under the magazine (4). 
Block stapler according to one of claims 1 to 2, characterised 
thereby that the abutment is mounted to be rotatable through about 

45Â° in both directions. 
Block stapler according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 
thereby that detent positions for positional fixing are associated 

with the abutment (1) in its rotated end position. 
Block stapler according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised 
thereby that each abutment side of the abutment (1) is provided with 

a support surface (3). 
Block stapler according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised 
thereby that the support surfaces (3) of the abutment (1) are offset 

relative to the surface of the abutment (1). 
Block stapler according to claim 6, characterised thereby that 
the support surfaces (3) are arranged to face one another. 
Block stapler according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised  
 

thereby that the underside of the magazine (4) is placeable on the 
support surfaces (3) of the abutment (1) rotated into the end 

position. 
Block stapler according to one of claims 4 to 8, characterised 
thereby that each time one side of a double-arm abutment (1) bears in 

the rotated end position against the magazine (4). 
Block stapler according to one of claims 5 to 9, characterised 

thereby that the height of the support surfaces (3) of the abutment 
(1) correspond to approximately one third of the length of the 

largest stapling clip type coming into use. 
Block stapler according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that an element serving as a range spacer is mounted in the abutment 

(1). 
Block stapler according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the element mounted in the abutment (1) is withdrawable below the 

magazine. 
Block stapler according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby 
that a compression spring with release mechanism is associated with 

the element mounted in the abutment (1). 
Block stapler according to claim 1, characterised thereby that 
the range spacer is mounted in the base plate (5) to be withdrawable. 
Block stapler according to claim 14, characterised thereby that 
a compression spring with release mechanism is associated with the 

range spacer mounted in the base plate (5).
