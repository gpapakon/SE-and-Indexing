<ABSTRACT>
A transmission scheme contemplates encoding and modulating digital data onto a discrete multi-tone signal having a total banwidth of at least 1.6 MHz. The modulation system dynamically updates the subcarriers used and the amount of data transmitted on each subcarrier during transmission (215, 217, 219). In one embodiment, the multi-tone encoding and modulation complies with the ATIS North American Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines standard. However, additional subchannels (a total of 512) and/or subchannel bandwidths of greater than 4.3125 kHz may be used. In this system, the subchannels occurring above frequencies set forth in the standard are treated similarly to those within the standard range in terms of subcarrier selection criteria. This system permits transmission of digital data at transmission rates of 6-55 Mbps over twisted pair lines at distances of 1200 meters on lines experiencing significant crosstalk noise such as T1 or E1 (215, 217, 219), as well as at transmission rates of 10-50+Mbps over distances of 2000 meters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to systems for the transmission and reception
of multi-carrier, high speed data signals. More particularly, a discrete multi-tone (DMT)
system having a widened bandwidth is described.At the time of this writing, the Alliance For Telecommunications Information
Solutions (ATIS), which is group accredited by the ANSI (American National Standard
Institute) Standard Group, has finalized standard for the transmission of digital data over
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines (ADSL). The standard is intended primarily for
transmitting video data over ordinary telephone lines, although it may be used in a variety of
other applications as well. The standard is based on a discrete multi-tone transmission
system. Transmission rates are intended to facilitate the transmission of information at rates
of at least 6 million bits per second (i.e., 6+ Mbps) over ordinary phones lines, including
twisted-pair phone lines. The standardized discrete multi-tone (DMT) system uses 256
"tones" that are each 4.3125 kHz wide in the forward (downstream) direction. That is, in
the context of a phone system, from the central office (typically owned by the telephone
company) to a remote location that may be an end-user (i.e., a residence or business user).The Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines standard also contemplates the use of a
duplexed reverse signal at a data rate of at least 608 Kbps. That is, transmission in an
upstream direction, as for example, from the remote location to the central office. Thus, the
term Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line comes from the fact that the data transmission rate
is substantially higher in the forward direction than in the reverse direction. This is
particularly useful in systems that are intended to transmit video programming or video
conferencing information to a remote location over the telephone lines. By way of example, 
one potential use for the system allows residential customers to obtain video information
such as movies over the telephone lines rather than having to rent video cassettes. Another
potential use is in video conferencing.As is well known to those familiar with the Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines
standardization process, as well as telephone systems generally, most telephone systems are
divided into a multiplicity of carrier service areas that have a desired maximum carrier
service area (CSA) range. In the U.S., maximum carrier service area ranges of 2 miles
from a "central office" are typical when 24-gauge twisted pair wiring is
