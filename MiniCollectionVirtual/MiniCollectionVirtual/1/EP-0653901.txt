<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a carbon electrode joint as defined in claim 1 and a
fastening element as defined in claim 9 for securing the joint formed by a threaded
nipple which connects together contiguous, abutting sections
of carbon, including graphite, electrodes to provide a stable
longitudinally extending electrode column for use in an
electric arc furnace. More particularly, the present
invention is directed to an electrode joint fastening element
formed of carbon, including graphite, which is adapted to be
friction fitted in a passage at the electrode joint.With state-of-the-art conventional carbon electrodes a pair
of longitudinally extending vertically positioned electrode
sections are coupled by means of a threaded graphite nipple
which is threaded into correspondingly threaded opposed
sockets of the electrode sections, with the result that the
respective opposing butt faces of the vertical electrode
sections are brought into abutting contact. As an electrode
section is consumed in the course of furnace operation, a new
electrode section is tandemly coupled in the same manner so
that furnace operation can proceed continuously. That is, as
the lower end of the column is consumed in the furnace, the
entire column is lowered to maintain the operation and
electrode sections are joined to the top of the column to
replenish the consumed columns. However, there is occasional
loosening of the threadably engaged joint which can lead to
increased electrical resistance and also to mechanical
failure, i.e. breakage of a threaded nipple joint which
requires the interruption of electric furnace operation. An early prior art effort to address this problem with
respect to horizontally positioned carbon electrode sections
is disclosed in U.S. Patent 1,572,534 - Hinckley which
describes a variety of blade shaped metal implements which
are forced into the electrode joint and act as a key to
prevent loosening of the joint. Due to the temperatures
experienced in modern electric arc furnaces, a metal key
would melt and be ineffective as the electrode joint
approached the high temperature electrode arc from above.DE-C-901 222 disclosed a fastening element suitable for
securing a joint between opposed abutting electrode sections
comprising a longitudinally extending elongate article formed
from synthetic carbon.It has been found, as part of the present invention, that
threaded nipple joint failures commonly occur when the
coupled carbon, including graphite, electrode sections and/or
nipple loosen and are not firmly in

<CLAIMS>
A carbon electrode joint comprising

two abutting electrode sections (10, 20)

vertically positioned,
longitudinally coaxially aligned,
each having a butt face (113, 115) transverse to its longitudinal axis
(30, 40),
each having a threaded socket (117, 119) in its butt face,
each being formed from extruded and baked stock of carbon (210)
which was extruded in the direction of their respective longitudinal

axes (30, 40) so that the respective longitudinal axes (30, 40) and
electrode sections (10, 20) extend in a with-the-grain direction,
a correspondingly threaded nipple (70)

longitudinally coaxially aligned with and joining said electrode sections
(10, 20) in an abutting relationship to define a contact interface

between the butt faces (113, 115) of the electrode sections (10, 20)
which extends transverse to the longitudinal axes (30, 40) of the

electrode sections (10, 20),
being formed from extruded and baked stock of carbon (210) which
was extruded in the direction of its respective longitudinal axes (30, 40)

so that the respective longitudinal axes (30, 40) and threaded nipple
(70) extend in a with-the-grain direction,
a passage (100) extending from outside of the electrode joint through a
portion of said contact interface (110) and through opposing abutting

portions (120, 122) of said electrode sections (10, 20) and
an elongate carbon fastening element (200) formed from extruded and
baked stock friction fitted in said passage (100).
An electrode joint in accordance with claim 1 wherein said fastening
element (200) is having a with-the-grain direction resulting from its

extrusion and having a longitudinal axis (60) which is transverse to its
with-the-grain direction and has its with-the-grain direction in-line with the

An electrode joint according to claim 1 wherein said passage (100) is a

equally partitioned between the respective electrode sections (10,

20).
An electrode joint according to claim 3 wherein fastening element is
formed from extruded an baked stock and having a with-the-grain

electrode sections, and said fastening element has a circular cross-section

and visual indicia from which its with-the-grain direction can be
determined.
