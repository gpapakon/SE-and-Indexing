<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a bidirectional compression-action clutch with clip elements (14), disposed between a second ring (10) and a first ring (12), for torque direction of action A and the same or other clip elements (15) for torque direction of action B, the two rings being connected to each other by one or two rotating cages (18, 19) with frictional elements (20, 21). Also fitted are centrifugal elements (25) which operate in conjunction with cage (19) and/or the first ring (12). Owing to the difference between the rotational speeds of the first and second rings (10, 12), either clip elements (14) or clip elements (15), depending on the direction of rotation, are brought into engagement. At high speeds, this is prevented by the centrifugal elements (25). Thus, at high speeds with the vehicle moving forwards, a freewheeling action is produced which enables overbraking of the rear wheels of the vehicle to be avoided.
