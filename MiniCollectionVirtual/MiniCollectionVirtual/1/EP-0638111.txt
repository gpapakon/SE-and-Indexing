<ABSTRACT>
A decorative film that is free of deterioration of the surface film due to the generation of wrinkles even when being applied to an adherent having plasticizer migration ability, such as polyvinyl chloride, and an adhesive thereof comprising: 100 parts by weight of a copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of 700,000-1,200,000 obtained by copolymerization of 64-75 % by weight of a (meth)acrylate having a C4-C8-alkyl group, 20-26 % by weight of methyl methacrylate and 5-10 % by weight of acrylic acid, and 0.005 to 0.1 parts by weight of a crosslinker.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plasticizer resistant, decorative film 
and an adhesive therefor. A decorative film is comprised of a surface film, such as vinyl 
chloride, on which an adhesive layer is applied or laminated and, in some 
cases, said adhesive layer is protected by a release film. In the case of 
possessing a release film, this decorative film is used by applying it on the 
surface of an adherent (article to be decorated) after removing the release 
film. In this case, since the adherent is comprised of a resin having a strong 
plasticizer migration ability, such as a vinyl chloride resin, when the surface 
film is a film having a low plasticizer resistance, such as a vinyl chloride 
sheet, the plasticizer is migrated from the adherent to the surface film, 
generating wrinkles on the surface sheet and, thereby resulting in the 
impairment of its decorative characteristics and weathering characteristics. 
For this reason, a means is required to prevent the deterioration of the surface 
film due to the migration of the plasticizer from the adherent. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 59-5944 discloses 
a decorative film which prevents the migration of a plasticizer from an 
adherent to the film by placing a barrier layer comprising a urethane resin 
between a vinyl chloride surface film and an adhesive layer. In such an 
aspect, however, the production cost become unduly expensive because of the 
addition of the barrier layer. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 3-45671 discloses a decorative film which utilizes a surface film having 
improved plasticizer resistance due to the content of a urethane resin, and an 
adhesive containing a plasticizer resistant monomer, such as vinyl acetate.  
 However, the cost of this decorative film tends to be expensive due to the use 
of the surface film containing a urethane resin. EP-A-0 338 724 refers to an acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive that is 
especially suited for adhering to plasticized PVC and similar substrates. The 
adhesive contains butyl acrylate, a copolymerizable vinyl compound, α,β-ethylenically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid, a crosslinker and perferably up to 50% of a tackifier. DE-A-2407494 discloses a PSA-composition on the basis of a certain 
composition of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid derivatives. The composition contains 
a plasticizer. US-A-4983656 discloses an aqueous pressure sensitive adhesive containing 
(1) an aqueous copolymer emulsion of at least one alkyl(meth)acrylate, an
