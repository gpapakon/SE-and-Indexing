<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for the preparation of 1-methyl-3-keto-(Delta)1,4-steroids of general formula (I) in which St represents the residue of a steroid molecule, the method being characterized in that a 3-keto-(Delta)1,4-steroid of general formula (II) in which St is as defined above is reacted in an inert solvent, in the presence of a nickel salt which is soluble in the solvent, with an organometallic compound of formula (III), (IV) or (V) in which X is a methyl group, an alkoxy group with a maximum of 6 carbon atoms or a phenoxy group optionally substituted by halogen atoms, alkoxy groups with a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and/or alkyl groups with a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and Y1, Y2 and Y3 as well as Z1 and Z2, which may be the same or different, are the same as X.

Process for the manufacture of 1-methyl-3-keto-Δ
1,4
-steroids 
of the general formula I 


 
wherein 


R
1
 and R
2
 together represent an oxo group or an alkylenedioxy 
group having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, or wherein 

R
1
 represents an acyloxy group having up to 8 carbon 
atoms or an alkyl radical having a maximum of 10 carbon 

atoms and 
R
2
 denotes a hydrogen atom, 
 
characterised in that a 3-keto-Δ
1,4
-steroid of the 
general formula II 


 
wherein R
1
 and R
2
 have the meanings given above, is 
reacted in an inert solvent, in the presence of a nickel 

salt soluble therein, with an organometallic compound of 
the formula III, IV or V  

 

CH
3
- Zn- X
 
or 


 
wherein 


X represents a methyl group, an alkoxy group having a 
maximum of 6 carbon atoms, or a phenoxy radical 

optionally substituted by halogen atoms, alkoxy groups 
having a maximum of 6 carbon atoms and/or by alkyl 

groups having a maximum of 6 carbon atoms,
 
   and 
Y
1
, Y
2
 and Y
3
 and also Z
1
 and Z
2
 are identical or 
different and have the same meanings as X, 
 
at a temperature of from 40 to 80°C in one reaction 

step, the 1-methyl group being introduced while the 
double bond is re-formed simultaneously.
