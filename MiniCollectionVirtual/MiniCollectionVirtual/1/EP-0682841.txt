<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a noise reduction filter, more particularly to a
filter for image data noise reduction. The invention also relates to a noise reduction filtering
method and to an image signal receiver comprising a noise reduction filter.Noise reduction of image data is generally realized through averaging of
likely correlated picture elements. The likelihood may be due to spatial or temporal
proximity. The closer the proximity, the higher the likelihood that picture elements (pixels)
have the same value if noise were not present. Both linear and non-linear filters have been
used for noise reduction purposes, as well as the intermediate solution of adapting filter
coefficients to local picture statistics.The article "Extended-Order Statistic Filter and Evaluation of Noise
Reduction Performance", Electronics and Communications in Japan, Part 3, Vol. 74, No. 5,
1991, pp. 1-11, discloses an extended-order statistic filter for image data noise reduction.
The distinction between order statistic filters (OSF) and linear filters is that in an OSF,
weighting coefficients are not related to the spatial or temporal distance with respect to the
current sample, but to the order of the samples after ranking them on the basis of their signal
value. In the extended-order statistic filter described in the article, the coefficients not only
depend on the order of the signal values, but also on the order of differences between the
signal values of neighboring samples and the signal value of the current sample (differential
OSF), and further on the distance to the current sample. It was shown that this type of filter
can combine the advantages of linear and non-linear filtering on gaussian noise and impulse
noise, respectively. The transversal nature of these filters makes them rather expensive when
applied to profit from the temporal correlation in image sequences.JP-A-2/67,688 shows an image noise removing system in which, to
prevent the generation of blur, filter characteristics are based on a relation between a central
pixel and a weighted averaged pixel in the case of filtering a pixel positioned on the
boundary of blocks. A weighted average of a central pixel and eight neighboring pixels
surrounding the central pixel is determined. If the difference between the central pixel and 
the weighted average is smaller than a threshold, the weighted average is supplied, whereas
when the difference exceeds the threshold, the unfiltered central pixel is supplied.DE-C-39.27.101 shows a noise reduction filter in which a
