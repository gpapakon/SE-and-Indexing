<ABSTRACT>
Herein is described an apparatus (10) for the 
sewing and finishing of tie tips and the use of same 

through the use of properly modified and integrated 
sewing machines. The apparatus comprises a base (12) 

and a cover (40), each of similar form to the tie tip. 
The fabrics to be sewn are positioned between the base 

(12) and said cover (40) and, by means of a lever (80) 
system, instruments of friction (56, 58) are shifted, 

properly placed on the cover, which pull the upper 
fabric and take it to assume a configuration which 

allows for the sewing through an appropriate sewing 
slot. Said apparatus (10) permits an easier positioning 

of the fabrics, the possibility to regulate the sewing 
rim in a different way along the sides of the tip and 

along the flanks and the possibility of use in an 
automated work circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an apparatus for the sewing
and finishing of tie tips and its use through the use of
properly modified and integrated sewing machines.As is known, the tie is produced using a strip of
fabric with the ends cut in a tip shape: this is sewn to
the lining and subsequently folded again in a proper
way.The sewing carried out with automatisms presents
particular problems regarding the quality of the results
in comparison with the sewing with a traditional
machine. These problems have been partially resolved
with the tie tip finishing apparatus disclosed in United
States Patent no. 4644885. In the aforementioned
patent, a device for the sewing of tie ends is claimed,
comprising a base on which is placed a first fabric on
which, in turn, is placed a blade having upward
protruding borders at one or more corners, thus, by
superimposing on it another properly conformed fabric,
by closing said fabrics and the blade between said base
and a cover, and through said upward protruding borders,
upward folds are formed on the upper fabric at the
corners in such a way so as to allow the sewing of the
two fabrics along the entire contour.While this allows the sewing to the lining the
entire external border of the fabric at the ends of the
tie, said device presents several inconveniences. 
First, when it is necessary to position the borders of
the fabric to be sewn in the device, one must be very
careful that the upper fabric is further than the other
because, otherwise, when the cover is closed, the lower
fabric backs up with respect to the upper fabric,
causing evident anti-aesthetic effects. This operation
requires a certain care on the part of the operator with
the possibility, however, of having poor results when
this operation is done without care.Another serious inconvenience of the prior art is
the impossibility of being able to vary, with the same
apparatus, the size of the rim. The possibility to be
able to vary the size of the rim along the sides of the
tip and flank in an independent manner is often
important since it is often required by the stylists who
wish to offer a high quality product with hand type
finishing. Further, the saving of material attained by
reducing the rim, though apparently little, can be
important, taking into account the high cost of fabric
used (very often silk).Again, with the end of reducing the cost of
production of ties, it would naturally be desirable to
be able to realize equipment which permits the use of
one or more of said apparatuses in a work circuit
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Tie-tipping apparatus comprising a base (12)
with a form, in one of its portions, similar to the tie

tip; a cover (40), hinged at the base (12) with a zone
of a form similar to the tie tip but with smaller

dimensions with respect to the base tip, a sewing slot
of fundamentally the same size as the above-mentioned

cover (40) zone, characterized in that on said base
(12), on the contour of the sewing slot, friction means

(34), integral with said base (12), are provided; on
said cover (40), a lever system (80) is provided which

acts to move friction means which place the upper fabric
to be sewn to the lower fabric in a proper way for the

sewing operation; it is possible to vary the sewing rim
of the tip sides by shifting the lever device (80) along

the cover axis; the two fabrics to be sewn together are
to be positioned on top of each other in such a way that

their tip sides coincide and lay against the wall means
(32a, 32b), which are able to determine the exact

position.
Apparatus as in claim 1, characterized in that
the shifting of said friction means (56, 58) on the

cover is attained by the lever system (80), causing
first, second, third and fourth screws (62, 64, 70 and

72) to move into respective grooves (60, 66, 68, and
74).
Apparatus as in claim 2, characterized in that
the friction means (56a, 56b) at the tip sides (44a, 

44b) of the cover (40) shift in a direction parallel to
said tip sides (44a, 44b) while the friction means next

to the flanks (46a, 46b) of the cover (40) shift, guided
within the grooves (68, 74) on an angle with respect to

the cover axis, said angle (alpha) being such that with
the increase in its value, the rim size on the flank

increases.
Apparatus as in claim 3, characterized in that
the base sewing slot is representable by a polygonal

broken line having slot tip sides (22a, 22b), slot
flanks (24a, 24b), and slot parts (26a, 26b) essentially

perpendicular to said flanks (24a, 24b) and directed
toward the contours of the base (12), and a slot

extension (28) which extends from the sewing slot tip
essentially extending one of said tip sides (22a or 22b)

toward the opposite base side (18a or 18b), said slot
parts (26a, 26b) permitting the entrance and exit of

said lower guide (120) from said sewing slot during the
use of the apparatus (10) in a work circuit (130).
Apparatus as in claim 4, characterized in that
it is possible to use one or more of said apparatuses in

a work circuit (130) which moves said apparatuses,

manually loaded beforehand with the fabric, next to the
sewing machine (132) which performs the sewing line

without needing any further action by the operator, with
the exception of the unloading of the sewn fabric.
Machine comprising one or more apparatuses (10),
according to one or more of the preceeding claims, 

comprising a transport apparatus(es) and further, a sewing
machine (132) whose sewing needle is fixed with respect

to the machine, and characterized in that the entire
movement of the apparatus(es) (10) is controlled

electronically, in that there are provided sensors to
determine the exact position of the apparatus (10) with

respect to the circuit (130) and in that said
apparatus(es), next to the sewing machine, move(s) in a

direction perpendicular to the machine direction through
a pantograph (134).
Machine as in claim 6, characterized in that a
lower guide (120) of the needle is provided, said needle

engaging the interior of the sewing slot; in that an
upper needle guide (122) is provided, comprising a rim

(124) which runs along the contour of the apparatus (10)
to the upper cover face (40); in that, further, when the

needle is next to the sewing slot tip (38), said lower
guide (120) continues along said slot extension (28)

while said upper guide (122) is raised to avoid sewing
of the tip of the fabric, after which said lower guide

(120) returns in the slot tip (38) traveling in the
opposite direction into the slot extension (28), the

upper needle guide (122) goes down and rests again at
the beginning of the adjacent tip side (22a) to continue

the sewing.
Machine as in claim 7, characterized in that one
or more electronically controlled pusher devices (136)

are provided which make possible the continuing the 
performance of the sewing once the needle and its guides

(120, 122) are arrived at next to the sewing slot tip
(38), pushing the apparatus in the machine direction.
Machine as in claim 8, characterized in that the
pantograph is controlled directly by the motor of the

sewing machine through a system of belts and pulleys and
engages the apparatus through little wheels (76)

connected to the lower face of the apparatus itself.
Machine as in claim 9, characterized in that
the advancement of the apparatus occurs with increasing

velocity from the lower dead point to the upper dead
point of the needle and in that the sewing stitch is

maintained at constant length through the variation of
the advancement velocity of the carriage and made in

phase with the sewing machine.
