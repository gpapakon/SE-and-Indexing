<ABSTRACT>
A picture processor for a video conference device, 
etc., can be used easily by carrying it into a room 

other than the video conference room, has an object of 
enabling the display of the input picture to be 

switched freely even if the picture of the line drawing 
is displayed together with the input picture. The 

picture of a line drawing, etc., is held at the 
corresponding position even in cases where the display 

of the input picture is switched by updating the input 
picture data, which is stored in the input picture 

memory 40, on the basis of the line drawing data and by 
writing the picture expressed with the line drawing 

data directly in the input picture, which is stored in 
the input picture memory 40.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image processor and 
more particularly, to a video conference apparatus in 
which picture data is compressed and transmitted 
together with audio data, etc. In a previous video conference apparatus, it 
is so arranged that communication can be made with a 
desired communication object at a remote site by 
sending and receiving audio data, image data, etc., 
between predetermined transmission objects. That is, this kind of video conference apparatus 
obtains or picks-up images of a person attending a 
conference through a predetermined imaging section, 
fetches and compresses these pick-up images, and then 
sends them to a communication object. Furthermore, the video conference apparatus also 
sends audio signals of this person present at a 
conference to a communication object and displays the 
image data coming from the communication object on a  
 
predetermined display by decompressing the data. Furthermore, the video conference apparatus sends 
line drawing data which is input through a tablet, 
etc., to a communication object in response to a user 
operation, or in place of this, inputs a still picture 
through an image scanner, etc., and sends it to a 
communication object. The video conference 
apparatus was so arranged that it can be used installed 
in a dedicated video conference room so as to be able 
to send and receive a large capacity of data between 
communication objects by connecting with lines of 
optical fiber, for example. It is hereby contemplated that, if this kind of video 
conference apparatus could be used freely in places other 
than a video conference room e.g. by carrying the apparatus 
to such places as the need arises, the usage of this kind of 
video conference apparatus could be improved and the 
apparatus would be more convenient. In addition, the 
application field of this kind of video conference apparatus 
could be extended. For this reason, it is proposed that this kind of 
video conference apparatus should be connected not only 
with optical fiber lines, but also with, for example, 
an integrated service digital network (ISDN) which  
 
is widely distributed to general users. Furthermore, not 
only should connection with this kind of line be made 
possible, but also overall configuration should be made 
simple. Furthermore, the operation of the apparatus itself 
should be simple. It should be arranged so that 
not only dedicated operators, but also users who are 
unfamiliar with its operation can operate it easily. In view of the
