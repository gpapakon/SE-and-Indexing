<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amino acid derivatives 
having high activity for inhibiting tumor metastasis, weak 
activity for inhibiting platelet aggregation and weak 
anticoagulation activity. Fibronectin and vitronectin are proteins referred as 
extracellular matrix molecules and involved in the cell-extracellular 
substrate adhesion. Recently, it was found that 
these interactions are mediated by a series of receptors present 
on cell surfaces and that Arg-Gly-Asp sequences in the cell 
adhesion domains of fibronectin act as recognition sites 
(Nature, 309, 1984, p30). It has also been reported that one of the cell 
receptors is VLA-5 receptor which belongs to the integrin 
family. It has been also known that the Arg-Gly-Asp sequences 
present in other adhesive proteins such as vitronectin. Further, the extracellular matrix molecules are considered 
to adhere to the receptors of cells to be adhered and transmit 
their information to the adhered cells. In addition, they are 
also considered to have abilities for binding to biological 
macromolecules such as heparin, collagen and fibrin and to be 
involved in adhesion between cells and interstitial connective  
 
tissue, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. Further, the extracelllar matrix molecules are expected to 
be involved in adhesion and release of tumor cells observed in 
tumor metastasis. Therefore, there have been reported attempts 
to inhibit tumor metastasis by using peptides containing the 
recognition sequence, Arg-Gly-Asp. Yamada et al. demonstrated 
that the adhesion signal of fibronectin, a pentapeptide (Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser), 
inhibits experimental metastasis of B16-F10 
melanoma cells to lungs (Science, Vol. 233 (1986) p467). 
Further, there have been disclosed methods for more efficient 
inhibition of tumor metastasis by using oligopeptides containing 
the sequence or polypeptides containing the sequences as 
repeating units (Int. J. Biol. Macromol., Vol. 11 (1989), p23; 
Int. J. Biol. Macromol., Vol. 11 (1989), p226; Jpn. J. Cancer 
Res., Vol. 60 (1989), p722; and Japanese Patent Un-examined 
Publication (KOKAI) No. Hei 2-174789). It has been also known that peptides containing the Arg-Gly-Asp 
sequence inhibit platelet aggregation. It is considered 
that plate let aggregation is caused by bindings of Von 
Willebrand factors, plasma proteins and fibrinogen mainly to the 
platelet receptors present on platelets referred to as 
GPIIb/IIIa, which bindings form a crosslinking structure.
