<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is related to novel polypeptide consisting of 
187 amino acids which is produced in a human glioblastoma cell line, a 

method of producing it, DNA encoding the said polypeptide, a fragment 
capable of selectively hybridizing to the DNA sequence, a replication or 

expression vector comprising the DNA and a host cell transformed with the 
replication or expression vector. The polypeptide of the present invention 

may be useful for the prevention of or in the treatment of aplasia or abnormal 
proliferation, of cells, depression or enhancement of activity, tumors, or the 

deseases induced by lipid metabolism abnormality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a novel peptide produced by a 
certain cell line and DNAs encoding it. It is understood that cells generate many factors relating to 
maintenance, proliferation and growth, of cells. For example, many factors 
relating to differentiation, proliferation and growth of neurons and glia, are 
generated from glia which constitutes a brain. Present inventors have directed their attention to this point and 
energetic research has been carried out in order to find novel factors 
(polypeptides) which a certain cell (e.g., glia) generates. Until now, when a man skilled in the art intends to obtain a particular 
polypeptide or a DNA encoding it, he generally utilizes methods by 
confirming an intended biological activity in a tissue or in a cell medium, 
isolating and purifying the polypeptide and then cloning a gene or methods 
by "expression-cloning" with the guidance of the biological activity. However, physiologically active polypeptides in living body have 
often many kinds of activities. Therefore, it is increasing that after a gene is 
cloned, the gene is found to be identical to that encoding a polypeptide 
already known. Generally cell generates only a very slight amount of a 
factor and it makes difficult to isolate and to purify the factor and to confirm its 
biological activity. On the other hand, preparation technique and sequencing technique 
of cDNA have been rapidly developed, and it has been able to sequence a  
 
large quantity of cDNA. Further, methods of "Reverse Genetics" of 
characterizing the function of a gene from the sequence of the gene, have 
been greatly developed. The present inventors attempted to find novel polypeptides by using 
these methods. That is, a series of methods was carried out by isolating 
mRNA from glia etc., obtaining cDNA by using mRNA thus obtained as a 
starting material, deciding its nucleotide sequence and deducing its amino 
acid sequence. In this manner, the present inventors have succeeded to 
find a novel human gene encoding phosphatidylethanolamine binding 
protein. According to the sequence analysis, bovine gene encoding 
phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (basic 21-KD protein) were 
found, as the sequence having high homology to that of polypeptide of the 
present invention, when amino acid sequences of the polypeptide were 
compared by a computer to all known sequences in data base of Swiss Prot 
(Swiss Prot Release 2.0). However, there was no human nucleotide 
sequence which is identical to that encoding the
