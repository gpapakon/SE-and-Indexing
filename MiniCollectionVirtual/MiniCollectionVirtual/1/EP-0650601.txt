<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for sensing and locating sources of ionizing radiation retained in a tumour in a body environment, including a hand-held probe and comprising a housing with a sensor circuit for outputting a response to interaction between the radiation and the sensor; a unit for processing signals from the sensor circuit; and an indicator responding to driving signals applied thereto by generating an audible or visual output. Said hand-held probe comprises at least one scintillating plastic optical fibre (2) connecting the sensing end to a light sensor (1).

Apparatus for detecting and locating ionizing-radiation 
sources retained by a tumour in the 

environment of a body, of the type comprising a probe 
which can be manipulated by hand and including a casing 

comprising a photodetector (1) capable of producing a 
response to an interaction of light signals with this 

photodetector (1), means for processing the electrical 
signals coming from the said photodetector (1) in order 

to provide drive signals, and warning means (13, 14) 
which respond to the said drive signals by emitting an 

audibly or visually perceptible output signal in 
response to the said drive signals which are applied to 

it, characterized in that the manipulable probe 
comprises at least one scintillating plastic optical 

fibre (2), clad with a material in the form of an 
opaque flexible jacket (3) and having a front end (4)  

 
and a rear end, the front end being closed by a plug 

(5) consisting of the same material as the jacket, and 
the rear end connecting the said probe to the said 

photodetector (1) in order to convert the said light 
signals emitted by the scintillating optical fibre (2) 

into electrical signals. 
Apparatus for detecting and locating radiation 
sources retained by a tumour according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that the casing comprises a 
photomultiplier tube as photodetector (1), and means 

(6) for optically coupling at least one scintillating 
optical fibre (2) to the said photomultiplier. 
Apparatus for detecting and locating radiation 
sources retained by a tumour according to either of the 

preceding claims, characterized in that the flexible 
opaque jacket (3) is sterilizable and contains a bundle 

of from 2 to 6 scintillating optical fibres having a 
unitary diameter of approximately 1 millimetre. 
Apparatus for detecting and locating radiation 
sources retained by a tumour according to any one of 

the preceding claims, characterized in that a shutter 
is arranged between the photomultiplier (1) and the 

means (6) for optical coupling of the bundle of 
scintillating fibres.  

 
Apparatus for detecting and locating radiation 
sources retained by a tumour according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that the end of the scintillating 
plastic fibre is solidly attached to an exploration 

tool. 
Apparatus for detecting and locating radiation 
sources retained by a tumour according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that the end of the scintillating 
plastic fibre is solidly attached to a surgical tool. 
Apparatus for detecting and locating radiation 
sources retained by a tumour according to any one of 

Claims 2 to 4, characterized in that the optical 
coupling means consists of a tubular part (6) in which 

the photomultiplier (1) is housed, the tubular part (6) 
being internally lined with a light-absorbent coating 

and having at its end a means (7) for connection of a 
connector provided at the end of the optical fibre (2).
