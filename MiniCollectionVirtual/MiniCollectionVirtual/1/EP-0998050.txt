<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for receiving a frequency
modulated and a digitally modulated signal in a mobile station. According to the invention

both signal modes are received by direct conversion. Thus the arrangement
according to the invention comprises one combined direct conversion receiver for

receiving both signal modes. Most preferably the combined direct conversion receiver
comprises a common section (55) for the signal modes, a section (56A, 56B)

for the digitally modulated signal, and a section (57) for the frequency modulated
signal. For the processing of the frequency modulated signal there is most preferably

used a demodulator (53) which comprises two branches comprising pulse detectors,
where the first branch detects the rising edge of the signal and the second branch

detects the falling edge of the signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a method and an arrangement for receiving a frequency
modulated and a digitally modulated signal advantageously in a mobile station.There are known dual mode receivers which are realised by intermediate frequency
techniques (superheterodyne). When intermediate frequency techniques are used the
received radio frequency signal is mixed to a lower frequency by using one or more
intermediate frequencies. Dual mode receivers provide a digital in-phase signal I
and a digital quadrature signal Q with a phase shift of 90°.A problem in the known devices receiving a frequency modulated and a digitally
modulated signal is the generally used intermediate frequency technique, which is
not so advantageous as the direct conversion techniques currently becoming more
commonplace. The direct conversion technique or the zero intermediate frequency
technique means here the use of one frequency mixing step for converting the received
modulated signal into I/Q signals having a sufficiently low frequency for the
low-pass filters then used in the channel filtering.The object of the invention is to present a solution for the dual operating mode
which is more efficient than that provided by an intermediate frequency solution.The objects are attained by combining an analogue section to a digital receiver operating
by the principle of direct conversion or zero intermediate frequency, and
utilising as much existing techniques as possible.The invention relates to a method for receiving a frequency modulated and a digitally
modulated signal in a mobile station. According to the invention both signal
modes are received by direct conversion. Most advantageously the operation is such
that both signal modes are initially processed in a common manner, then the digitally
modulated signal is processed in a manner of its own and the frequency modulated
signal is processed in a manner of its own.The invention relates also to an arrangement for receiving a frequency modulated
and a digitally modulated signal in a mobile station. According to the invention it
comprises one direct conversion receiver for receiving both signal modes. Most advantageously
the direct conversion receiver for receiving both signal modes comprises: a common section for both signal modes;a section for the digitally modulated signal; anda section for the frequency modulated signal.  According to the invention it is possible to use a common section which already exists
in receivers according to the direct conversion technique, by adding an
