<ABSTRACT>
A control system 102 for operating a compressor bleed valve in a gas turbine
engine to prevent compressor operation in surge region determines engine stability

in response to a plurality of sensed engine parameters, and calculates and stores
engine parameters to estimate compressor performance relative to a stability limit

which is indicative of a surge operation. The control system further maintains a
rolling average of the estimate of compressor performance for up to a predetermined

number of engine flights. This rolling average of the estimate of compressor
performance is indicative of engine usage and associated engine degradation. The

control system determines a bias for the bleed valve in response to calculated
engine parameters and adjusts the operation of the bleed valve in response to the

compressor performance so as not to exceed the stability limit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the control of gas turbine compressors, and more particularly to a control system for a compressor bleed valve wherein the control system is responsive to engine usage for modulating the bleed valve.In the prior art of control systems for gas turbine engine compressors, it is known to modulate a compressor bleed valve to control the pressure rise across the compressor for the purpose of safely operating the compressor in a region below the compressor's surge line. The compressor's surge line is a stability limit represented as a line drawn through a number of points on a graph produced by coordinates that are computed using the pressure rise across the compressor and the corrected airflow through the compressor. It is desirable to operate gas turbine engines close to the compressor's surge line in order to achieve good fuel economy. However, operating the compressor in the surge region cannot be tolerated inasmuch as surge can result in sudden thrust loss and/or engine overtemperature and possible engine shutdown. Compressor surges may cause damage to the engine either in the form of cracking of vanes and blades in the compressor or by affecting the engine hot section parts due to surge-induced overtemperatures in the turbines.Typically, engine controls monitor various engine parameters and include schedules of other engine parameters which are used to automatically control the engine. More specifically, these controls generally account in various ways for the surge characteristics of the particular engine (with an adequate safety factor) for which the control is designed.Control systems to recover from a surge condition are known in the prior art. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,864,813; 5,165,844; 5,165,845; and 5,375,412, all assigned to the present applicant, disclose techniques for recovering from or rapidly correcting surge conditions. However, none of these patents disclose control systems that prevent the compressor from reaching the surge condition.Control systems that prevent operation in the surge region are known. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,991,389 to Schafer, assigned to the present applicant, discloses the maintenance of the compressor operating line at an approximately constant safe distance below the surge line over the entire operating range of the engine. The control system in the '389 patent modulates the compressor bleed valve between full open and full closed positions as a function of the rate of change of compressor speed biased by flight conditions
