<CLAIMS>
A solvent-free, aqueous synthetic-resin dispersion
comprising a polymer A) which is obtained by polymerization

of

A1) fully capped polyisocyanates in which some of
the capping groups contain an ethylenically unsaturated

group, and
A2)ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the
presence of an ionic resin B), where at least 1

mol of a saturated masking agent is used per
mole of the polyisocyanate and the remaining

isocyanate groups are blocked with masking
agents containing an unsaturated group as well

as an active hydrogen atom.
A synthetic-resin dispersion as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the ionic resin B is a cationic resin.
A synthetic-resin dispersion as claimed in claim 1,
wherein the ionic resin B is an amino-epoxy resin.
A process for the preparation of a synthetic-resin
dispersion as claimed in claim 1, which comprises

mixing a mixture of an ionic resin and at least one
ethylenically unsaturated monomer with a fully

capped polyisocyanate, where at least 1 mol of a
saturated masking agent is used per mole of the

polyisocyanate and the remaining isocyanate groups 
are blocked with masking agents containing an

unsaturated group as well as an active hydrogen
atom, converting this mixture to an aqueous

dispersion and then carrying out polymerization of
all of the ethylenically unsaturated groups by

means of emulsion polymerization.
A process for the preparation of a synthetic-resin
dispersion as claimed in claim 1, which comprises

neutralizing a mixture of an ionic resin and at
least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer, dispersing

the product in water, adding to this
dispersion a fully capped polyisocyanate, where at

least 1 mol of a saturated masking agent is used
per mole of the polyisocyanate and the remaining

isocyanate groups are blocked with masking agents
containing an unsaturated group as well as an

active hydrogen atom, and then polymerizing of all
of the ethylenically unsaturated groups by means of

emulsion polymerization.
The use of a synthetic-resin dispersion as claimed
in claim 1 as binder in electrodeposition coating

baths.
The use of a synthetic-resin dispersion as claimed
in claim 1 as binder in lead-free cationic

electrodeposition coating baths.
An article coated with a synthetic-resin dispersion
as claimed in claim 1.
