Device for monitoring the air-pressure in the air 
chambers of pneumatic tyres fitted on vehicle wheels, 

comprising 

a measuring device located on the vehicle, which 
outputs a pressure signal; 
a transmitting device fitted to the vehicle wheel, 
which receives the pressure signal coming from the pressure 

measuring device and transmits a pressure transmission 
signal corresponding thereto, 
a transmission control device provided in the 
transmitting device, which controls the emission of the 

transmission signal, 
a signal generator provided in the transmitting device 
which generates an identification signal that is 

characteristic of the individual transmitting device, said 
control device causing said identification signal to be 

emitted at least once before or after the emission of the 
pressure transmission signal, 
a receiving device spaced from the vehicle wheel, which 
receives the transmission signal emitted from the 

transmitting device, the receiving device having a memory in 
which is stored a reference identification signal related to 

the associated individual transmitting device according to 
a predetermined criterion and which is capable or being 

changed in order to match the identification signal and the 
reference identification signal from the transmitting and 

receiving devices with one another; 
a display device which is connected to the receiving 
device and displays as numerals or symbols data which are 

derived from the transmission signal received by the 
receiving device; 
a comparing device located in the receiving device, 
which tests whether the identification signal emitted by the  

 
transmitting device is related to the identification and 

reference signal stored in the receiving device, further 
processing of the signal received by the receiving device 

only taking place if the comparison signal received by the 
receiving device and the reference identification signal 

stored in the receiving device satisfy the relationship 
criterion, 
wherein the pressure measuring device fitted in the 
vehicle wheel outputs an electrical pressure signal 

representative of the pressure, 
 
characterised in that
 
the receiving device is connected to a switching device 

which enables the receiving device to be switched over from 
the normal operating mode in which the air-pressure is 

monitored into a matching mode in which the receiving device 
receives the identification signal transferred from each 

transmitting device and stores it as a reference 
identification signal, preferably with an assignment to the 

respective wheel position. 
Monitoring device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that a conversion device is provided which digitally 

codes the signals to be communicated by the transmitting 
device. 
Monitoring device according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in that at least the control device and the 

signal generating device of the transmitting device are 
combined in a first microprocessor device which is 

controlled by a program stored in a memory. 
Monitoring device according to at least one of claims 

1 to 3, characterised in that a signal amplification and 
filtering device, the comparing device and the memory for 

storing the reference identification signal of the receiving 
device are included in an integrated module.  

 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the identification signal is stored in 

the transmitting device as a digital sequence of numbers 
having n bits and that the reference identification signal 

is likewise stored in the receiver as a digital sequence of 
numbers having n bits. 
Monitoring device according to at least one of claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that the communication of the 

signals from the transmitting device to the receiving device 
takes place using electromagnetic waves (broadcast waves) of 

constant frequency as carrier waves. 
Monitoring device according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the frequency of the electromagnetic carrier waves 

is in the long wave region, preferably between 4 and 100 
kilohertz, more preferably between 4 and 50 kilohertz and 

most preferably between 4 and 15 kilohertz. 
Monitoring device according to claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterised in that the communication of the data takes 

place by means of a change in the phase angle of a 
sinusoidal carrier signal (phase shift keying), and 

preferably by means of a differential change in the phase 
angle (differential phase shift keying). 
Monitoring device according to at least one of claims 
1 to 8, characterised in that in each emission at least four 

bit sequences, each having a predetermined number of bits, 
are transmitted, the first bit sequence being a preamble 

which enables synchronisation of the receiving device with 
the transmitting device, one of the second and third bit

detector device which recognises a signal emitted by the
