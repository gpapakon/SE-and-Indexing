<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a negative-working lithographic
printing plate precursor. More particularly, it relates to
a lithographic printing plate precursor which enables plate
making by scan exposure based on digital signals, which shows
a high sensitivity and a high printing durability, which can
produce stain-free prints, and which can be mounted on a printing
press without conducting a special development processing after
image formation.A number of studies have been made on printing plates for
use in the computer-to-plate system having a remarkable
development. In the course of the studies, lithographic
printing plate precursors which can be mounted on a printing
press without being subjected to development processing after
imagewise exposure have been studied, and various methods have
so far been proposed.As one method which does not require the development
processing, there is a method, called an on press developing
method, which comprises mounting an exposed printing plate
precursor on a cylinder of a printing press and removing
non-image areas of the printing plate precursor by feeding a
dampening water and an ink while rotating the cylinder. That 
is, it is a method of mounting an exposed printing plate precursor
on a printing press and completing development processing during
the common printing procedures.A lithographic printing plate precursor adapted for such
on press development is required to have a light-sensitive layer
soluble in the dampening water or an ink solvent and such bright
room handling properties that it can be developed on a printing
press placed in a bright room.For example, Japanese Patent No. 2938397 discloses a
lithographic printing plate precursor comprising on a
hydrophilic support a heat-sensitive layer wherein fine
particles of a thermoplastic hydrophobic polymer are dispersed
in a hydrophilic binder polymer. In this patent, it is described
that, in the lithographic printing plate precursor, the fine
particles of the thermoplastic hydrophobic polymer are fused
to each other by heat generated by an infrared laser exposure
to thereby form an image, and that the resulting printing plate
can be mounted on a cylinder of a printing press and on press
developed with a dampening water and/or an ink.However, in the method of forming an image merely by
thermally fusing the thermoplastic polymer, the plate has such
a weak strength in image areas of the recording layer that there
results insufficient printing durability, though non-image
areas show a good on press
