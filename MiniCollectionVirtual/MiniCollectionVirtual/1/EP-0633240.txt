<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an improved process of recovering citric acid from an 
impure process stream such as fermentation broth by the addition of a strong 

acid or salts thereof to a concentrated solution of the citric acid. The process 
provides for essentially one step purification without the waste disposal 

problems or large capital investment required by either lime sulfuric or solvent 
extraction recovery processes. The recovery may be further improved by 

treating the mother liquor remaining after separation of the citric acid crystals 
to obtain an additional yield. The preferred strong acid is sulfuric acid and the 

preferred mother liquor treatment is an ion exclusion resin column. While the 
improved process is particularly advantageous when used as a one-step 

purification process for citric acid directly from fermentation broth, it may also 
be used in conjunction with the various impure process streams generated by 

the lime sulfuric or solvent extraction recovery processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
Production of organic acids by fermentation is well known and is practiced on a
large scale commercial basis throughout the world. In particular, citric acid is
produced commercially primarily by an aerobic fermentation process, which
employs molasses, starch, or a sugar such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, or
converted lactose as a substrate and a fungus such as Aspergillus niger or
yeast such as Candida lipolytica as biocatalyst. The fermentation product
typically contains biomass from the spent microorganism, carbohydrates, amino
acids, proteins and salts as well as citric acid which must be separated from the
fermentation broth to provide a pure product. The invention described herein
provides an improvement in the recovery of citric acid from impure process
streams.It can be difficult to separate the citric acid from the impurities generated during
such a process. Two principal techniques are used at this time: solvent
extraction as outlined in US Patent No. 4,275,234 to Baniel et al, and a lime-sulfuric
acid process. The lime sulfuric acid process has the disadvantage of
producing a vast quantity of calcium sulfate (gypsum) as a waste by-product
which has to be disposed of by landfill. The latter is both expensive and
environmentally distasteful. While the solvent extraction process is an
improvement as it eliminates the gypsum waste product and improves process
efficiency, it requires significant capital investment. Additional modifications of the
solvent extraction process have been proposed in US Patent No. 4,994,609 to 
Baniel and Gonen. However, a large capital investment is still required. A
modification of the lime-sulfuric process is proposed in EP 0 432 610 to Baniel
and Eyal which provides for the concurrent production of citric acid and alkali
citrates.In addition, the literature describes many other techniques for the purification of
the impure fermentation broth. Among the literature is published EP 0 167 957,
assigned to Hoechst AG which discloses a process for isolating water soluble
acidic compounds by bringing a solution of the acid into contact with a weakly
basic, adsorbent, ion exchange resin, preferably those containing tertiary amino
groups, and then desorbing the acid by water and/or steam.Offenlegungsschrift DE 3 502 924, assigned to Benckiser GmbH, discloses a
citric acid purification process involving membrane filtration, preferably
ultrafiltration, together with adsorption on a non-ionic resin such as polystyrene
or polyacrylamide followed by desorption and
