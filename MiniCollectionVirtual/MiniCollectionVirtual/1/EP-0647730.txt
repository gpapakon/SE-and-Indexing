<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a GaN single crystal which
is sufficiently thick and superior in quality, production
thereof and to a semiconductor light emitting element
comprising said GaN single crystal as a crystal substrate. The
GaN single crystal can serve well as a GaN single crystal
substrate for a semiconductor light emitting element comprising
a light emitting part composed of a poly-compound semiconductor
particularly having GaN as one component thereof.In the description to follow, the crystal substrate is
simply referred to as substrate. In addition, compound
semiconductors having GaN as one component thereof, such as a
binary mixed crystal GaN, poly mixed crystals such as GaAlN, GaBN,
InGaAlN, and InGaIBN are to be referred to as GaN group
compound semiconductors.Motivated by a demand for multicolor light emitting
displays and improved data density in communication and
recording, there is a strong desire for a semiconductor light
emitting element capable of emitting light of shorter
wavelength ranging from a blue light wavelength to an
ultraviolet wavelength.GaN is drawing much attention as a semiconductor material
to be used for said semiconductor light emitting element. The 
direct transition type band structure of GaN permits highly
efficient emission of light. GaN, moreover, emits light of
shorter wavelength ranging from a blue light wavelength to an
ultraviolet wavelength, due to a great band gap at room
temperature of 3.4 eV, thus rendering itself suitable for
the above-mentioned semiconductor devices.On the other hand, GaN requires a high crystal growth
temperature (a temperature where crystal growth can take
place), at which temperature the equilibrium vapor pressure of
nitrogen is high. The high pressure makes production of a
bulky single crystal of good quality from a molten solution of
GaN very difficult. Accordingly, a GaN single crystal has been
heteroepitaxially formed on a sapphire substrate or SiC
substrate superior in heat resistance by MOVPE (Metal Organic
Vapor Phase Epitaxy) or MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy).In recent years, however, there has been reported a method
(see Applied physics letter Vol.61 (1992) p.2688) wherein ZnO is
formed on a sapphire substrate as a buffer layer and GaN single
crystal is formed on the ZnO buffer layer. This method has
been conducive to the improvement in the quality of GaN single
crystal layer, as compared with direct crystal growth on a
sapphire substrate.The aforementioned conventional method using ZnO as a
buffer layer, however, fails
