<ABSTRACT>
A coated article and method of producing it are 
disclosed wherein the iridescence caused by the difference 

between the refractive index of a transparent substrate and 
the refractive index of a metal oxide coating is reduced by 

means of two intermediate layers, the first of which, closest 
to the substrate, has a refractive index higher than the 

refractive index of the substrate but lower than the 
refractive index of the second, and the second has a 

refractive index higher than the refractive index of the first 
but lower than the refractive index of the metal oxide 

coating. The thicknesses of the two intermediate layers for 
optimizing a neutral appearance are determined by the 

thickness and refractive index of the metal oxide coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the chemical 
vapor deposition of one or more metal oxides on a substrate, 
e.g. glass, and to the articles, e.g. neutral low emissivity 
coated glass, made thereby. It is known in the art that when a film of a 
transparent metal oxide, such as tin oxide, is deposited on a 
glass substrate, the coated glass substrate has non-uniform 
light reflection across the visible spectrum because of the 
difference in the refractive indices of the metal oxide and 
the glass substrate. In addition, when the thickness of the 
metal oxide coating is not uniform, the coating tends to 
display a multiplicity of interference color effects commonly 
referred to as iridescence. Such iridescence effects render 
the coated glass aesthetically unacceptable for most 
architectural applications. Thus, various methods to mask 
such iridescence effects and/or reduce reflectance have been 
proposed. One technique for minimizing or eliminating the 
effects of the difference between the refractive indices of a 
metal oxide and a glass substrate is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
No. 3,378,396 to Zaromb, wherein a glass substrate is coated 
by simultaneously directing separate sprays of a tin chloride 
solution and a silicon chloride solution onto a stationary 
heated glass piece in an oxidizing atmosphere, e.g. air. The 
heat of the glass piece thermally converts the metal chlorides 
to their metal oxides. The ratio of the two sprays is 
gradually varied to vary the ratio of the weight percent of 
the metal oxides in the coating. The resultant coating has a 
continuously-changing composition throughout its thickness,  
 
e.g. near the glass-coating interface, the coating is 
predominantly silicon oxide, the surface of the coating 
farthest from the glass-coating interface is predominantly tin 
oxide, and between the surfaces the coating is made up of 
varying weight percent amounts of silicon oxide and tin oxide. 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,206,252 and 4,440,882 further teach the 
depositing of fluorine-doped tin oxide on a gradient coating 
of the type taught by Zaromb. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,187,336 and 4,308,316 disclose 
the reduction of iridescence of a tin oxide coating on a glass 
substrate by the use of an intermediate coating between the 
tin oxide coating and the glass substrate having a thickness 
and refractive index satisfying the optical equation: the 
refractive index of the intermediate coating is equal to the 
square root of the refractive index of the glass substrate 
times the refractive
