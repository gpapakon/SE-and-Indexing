<ABSTRACT>
The multilayer metal cylinder head gasket consists of first and second functional layers (2,3) with reinforcing creases (8) on either side of the opening of a combustion chamber orifice (9). A stopper layer (5), a third functional layer (4) and a spacer (6) are positioned between the first and second functional layers. The reinforcing creases on the first and second functional layers point in the same direction while that on the third points in the opposite directions. All the creases are in line.

<CLAIMS>
Multilayer cylinder head gasket (1) with

at least one first (2) and one second (3) functional
layer, which each comprise a solid bead (8) opposite

a combustion chamber opening (9) in the cylinder head
gasket (1), and
with at least one spacer layer (6),

wherein the vertices (10) of the solid beads (8) of the
first (2) and the second (3) functional layer point in a

common direction,
characterised in that

the cylinder head gasket (1) has the following layer
structure in the indicated order:


the first functional layer (2),
a stopper layer (5),
a third functional layer (4) with a solid bead
(8),
the spacer layer (6) and
the second functional layer (3),

wherein the solid beads (8) are at least approximately in
alignment with one another radially by way of their

respective vertices (10).
Cylinder head gasket (1) according to Claim 1,

characterised in that
 the first (2) and the second
(3) functional layer each form an outer layer of the

cylinder head gasket (1).
Cylinder head gasket (1) according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that
 the stopper layer (5) is
flanged towards the third functional layer (4).
Cylinder head gasket (1) according to Claim 1, 2 or
3, 
characterised in that
 the vertex (10) of the solid
bead (8) of the first functional layer (2) and the 

vertex (10) of the third functional layer (4) face
the stopper layer (5).
Cylinder head gasket (1) according to any one of the
preceding Claims, 
characterised in that
 the cylinder
head gasket (1) consists of five layers (2, 3, 4, 5,

6).
