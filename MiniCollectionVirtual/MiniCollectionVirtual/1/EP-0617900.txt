P
) and 
piling the layer portions(L
P
) on one another in the 
direction of delivery of the cut tobacco layer(T
LH
) to 
form a cut tobacco train, a second tobacco band for

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system and a
method for manufacturing cigarettes, suited for the
manufacture of cigarettes of higher hardness.In general, a cigarette manufacturing machine
comprises a cut tobacco supply section, a wrapping
section, and a cutting section. The wrapping section
is supplied with a paper web, which travels in one
direction in the wrapping section. The supply section
feeds cut tobacco onto the paper web at the starting
end of the wrapping section. As the cut tobacco,
along with the paper web, passes through the wrapping
section, it is wrapped in the web to form a continuous
cigarette rod. Thereafter, the formed cigarette rod
is delivered from the wrapping section to the cutting
section. As it passes through the cutting section,
the cigarette rod is cut into individual cigarettes
with a predetermined length.An example of the supply section of a cigarette
manufacturing machine is disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln.
KOKOKU Publication No. 40-14560. This conventional
supply section is provided with an endless suction
band, that is, a tobacco band as it is called. The
tobacco band extends toward the wrapping section, and
has one surface formed as a suction surface. Cut
tobacco is attracted in a layer to the suction surface
of the tobacco band. As the tobacco band travels, the 
cut tobacco layer is transported toward the wrapping
section. The tobacco layer is released from the
attraction at the starting end of the wrapping section,
whereupon the cut tobacco is continuously fed
from the tobacco band onto the paper web at the wrapping
section.As shown in Fig. 1, a cut tobacco layer TL is
formed of individual tobacco shreds KT which are
stacked on a suction surface of a tobacco band 1.
Thereafter, the tobacco shred KT of the layer is fed
onto a paper web at the wrapping section.As the paper web 2, along with the tobacco shreds
KT, passes through the wrapping section, it is first
bent in the shape of a U, as shown in Fig. 2. Thereafter,
both sides of the U-shaped web 2 are successively
bent in a circular arc, whereupon a continuous
cigarette rod is formed.Fig. 3 shows a filter cigarette which is formed
of a cigarette obtained by cutting the cigarette rod
and a filter connected to the cigarette. Fig. 4 shows
an end face of the filter cigarette. In Figs. 3 and
4, reference numeral 3 denotes a lap portion which
combines both side edges of the paper web 2.As is evident from the foregoing description of
the process for forming the cigarette rod, the tobacco
shreds KT on the paper web 2 are kept
