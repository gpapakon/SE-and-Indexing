<ABSTRACT>
A washing machine (10) is integrated with a vehicle for 
its transportation. Said machine (10) comprises at least 

one chamber (11,12) in which are placed the objects to be 
washed and containing a plurality of nozzles (13,14,15,16) 

connected to a water source (22,34). The water is heated 
by means of heat produced by the operation of an explosion 

engine for movement of the vehicle. For example, the heat 
can be taken from the silencer (25) for evacuation of 

engine combustion fumes. 
In addition, the heat can be taken by means of a coil (36) 
traversed by a vehicle engine cooling liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various situations are known in which periodic washing of 
voluminous objects with not very high frequency and in any 
case not such as to justify the purchase of costly 
industrial washing machines are known. For example, in the case of bird farms or the like washing 
of the cages is required periodically or in the case of 
supermarkets periodic washing of the carts is required 
etc.. In such cases washing is then performed in a 
handicraft manner with jets of water directed by hand 
through a hose. It is clear that such washings cannot give 
high guarantees of cleanliness. It could be imagined that an especially equipped cleaning 
firm haul as necessary a washing machine to the site to 
perform the occasional washing operation. But an 
industrial washing machine, especially during the water 
heating operations, involves relatively high inputs which 
are not always readily available to those requiring the 
washing operation. The general purpose of the present invention is to obviate 
the above mentioned shortcomings by supplying an 
innovative vehicle with an integrated washing machine able 
to perform washing with no need of an external source of 
high electrical power. In view of said purpose it has been sought to provide in 
accordance with the present invention a washing machine 
integrated with a vehicle for its transportation  
 
comprising at least one chamber in which are placed the 
objects to be washed and containing a plurality of nozzles 
connected to a water source and at least one of said 
sources being heated by means of heat exchange with an 
element emitting heat produced by the operation of an 
explosion engine for movement of the vehicle. 
Advantageously the heat emitting element can be the 
silencer for evacuation of engine combustion fumes. 
In addition, the heat emitting element can be a coil 
traversed by a vehicle engine cooling liquid. To clarify the explanation of the innovative principles of 
the present invention and its advantages compared with the 
known art there is described below with the aid of the 
annexed drawings a possible embodiment by way of non 
limiting example applying said principles. In the 
drawings - 
FIG. 1 shows a schematic view of a washing machine in 
accordance with the present invention. FIG. 2 shows a schematic view of a possible embodiment of 
elements of the machine shown in the figures. With reference to the figures a washing machine 10 
integrated with a transporting vehicle with explosion 
engine such as for example a truck or van comprises 
adv
