<ABSTRACT>
In known telecommunication networks users (4-1 ... 4-M) of a facsimile 
machine (2-1 ... 2-N) are not identified. As a result, no evidential value relating to the 

identity of the sending user (4-3) or the identity of the receiving user (4-M) and the 
originality of the contents of the facsimile message can be derived from messages sent 

by facsimile machines (2-1 ... 2-N). A telecommunication network (1) according to the 
invention comprises identification means (3) for processing a user identification signal 

(USID). The identification means (3) are also arranged for producing a message (40) 
encrypted according to a digital signature method, which message states that a facsimile 

message has been exchanged between a sending user (4-3) and a receiving user (4-M). 
The message (40) is produced in a machine-readable code. Since this message (40) can 

only be generated by the identification means (3) and the contents cannot be modified 
unnoticed later on, this is proof of an exchange of a facsimile message between the 

sending user (4-3) and the receiving user (4-M).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a telecommunication network comprising at least a
facsimile machine.A facsimile machine to be used in such a telecommunication network is
described in French Patent Application 8803861
corresponding to the published document FR-A-2 660 135.
This facsimile machine comprises a PROM
memory whose contents cannot be changed by the user, in which the data of the facsimile
machine as well as the number of the telephone line to be used for facsimile transmission are
stored. When a facsimile is sent, these data plus day, time and information about the receiving
facsimile machine are printed on the original message by the sending facsimile machine. All
this information is sent along with the message to the receiving facsimile machine, so that it is
also printed on the received facsimile.As a result, both parties have information that a specific message has been
exchanged between a sending facsimile machine and a receiving facsimile machine on a
certain day and at a certain moment of time. A drawback of this method is that there is no
identification of a user of the facsimile machine such as there is an identification of the
receiver and the sender of a parcel in the case of registered post. As a result, no evidential
value relating to the identity of the sender, the identity of the receiver and the originality of the
contents of the facsimile message can be derived from messages sent by facsimile machine.It is an object of the invention to provide a method in which there is a
possibility to have a user of a facsimile machine identified by an independent body.Therefore, the present invention provides a certification method for facsimile
devices in a telecommunication system comprising at least a sending facsimile device, a
receiving facsimile device and an independent body, in which certification method at least the
contents of a facsimile message and/or the moment of transmission of the facsimile message
and/or a transmission event are certified by a digital signature and an unforgeable receipt or
certificate in machine readable form is provided by the independent body and in which
certification method users of both the sending and the receiving facsimile device are identified
by the independent body. Such a user identification signal is personal and can therefore be
entered only by the user. The identification means form part of the telecommunication
network and are therefore managed by an independent body. The identifying of a user of the 
facsimile machine by an independent body
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A certification method for facsimile devices in a telecommunication system
comprising at least a sending facsimile device, a receiving facsimile device and an

independent body, in which certification method at least the contents of a facsimile message
and/or the moment of transmission of the facsimile message and/or a transmission event are

certified by a digital signature and an unforgeable receipt or certificate in machine readable
form is provided by the independent body and in which certification method users of both the

sending and the receiving facsimile device are identified by the independent body.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the unforgeable receipt or certificate
has an easy user perceptible form, if the user is a human being.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a user identification signal is
processed so as to identify a user of the facsimile device.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein a received facsimile message is
archived after certification.
A telecommunication system comprising a least a sending facsimile device, a
receiving facsimile device and an independent body, certification means for certifying at least

the contents of a facsimile message, and/or the moment of transmission of the facsimile
message, and/or a transmission event, by a digital signature and an unforgeable receipt or

certificate in machine readable form is provided by the independent body, the system further
comprising identification means managed by the independent body for identifying users of

both the sending and the receiving facsimile device.
