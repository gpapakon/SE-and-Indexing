<ABSTRACT>
The missile has an imaging system and a detector which are behind light access permitting cover (12) in a defined position w.r.t. the latter. The cover has a useful aerodynamic shape with an arcuated face in the region of the beam path (28) of the optical imaging system. An extra diffractive optical element (30) is located in the beam path of the imaging system for correction of the phase deformation caused by the cover. The diffractive optical element is holographically generated and may have a computer produced structure.
