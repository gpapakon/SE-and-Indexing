<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an invisible support for 
fixing shelves to walls, comprising at least one 

horizontal element (2) insertable in a cavity (3) 
in a shelf (1), vertically constraining it to the 

support (6). The support (6) comprises at least 
one rawl (4), which can be hidden in the cavity 

(3) and which interacts between the horizontal 
element (2) and at least one wall (5) of the 

cavity (3) in such a way as to permit of free 
horizontal movement of the shelf (1) with respect 

to the support (6) only during a nearing 
operation, while preventing such movement in a 

retrograde direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an invisible support for 
fixing shelves and the like against walls, of the 
type having at least one horizontal element which can be 
inserted in a complementarily-shaped cavity in a 
shelf and which vertically constrains the shelf to 
the support. In the field of internal decoration, as is known, 
the above type of shelf is commonly used because 
of its aesthetic characteristics, which largely 
derive from the fact that the support of the shelf 
is totally hidden from view. For this aim, one or more cavities, shaped 
complementarily to the supports, are made in the 
wall, which cavities are accessible from the side 
of the shelf facing the wall. Known-type invisible supports, of whatever 
materials and variables, are always made in such a 
way as to constrain the shelf only in a vertical 
direction, but never in a horizontal direction 
too, due to the fact that the shelf has to be  
 
unslidable from the support bracket. This, however, constitutes a considerable 
drawback, especially regarding the safety of 
children who might swing from the shelves or slide 
them outwards in play, with obvious danger both to 
themselves and the objects perched on the shelves. 
This is in fact so dangerous that many of the more 
safety-conscious countries have already banned the 
use of such fittings. To encounter this grave problem, glues are 
sometimes used between the support and the 
cavities in the shelf, but here also drawbacks are 
inherent due to the slowness of their 
effectiveness after application, and also due to 
the variability of glue effectiveness, which 
depends on such things as the play between the 
shelf cavities and the support during the assembly 
operation. The aim of the present invention, as it is 
characterized in the claims that follow, is thus 
to eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks. The 
invention achieves its set aim by providing an 
invisible support having a horizontal element 
which can be inserted in a cavity in the shelf and 
comprising at least one adjustable barb which is  
 
hidden in the cavity and which interacts with the 
walls of the shelf in such a way as to permit free 
horizontal movement of the shelf when neared to 
the support, but preventing its backwards 
movement, that is, its opposite horizontal 
movement away from the wall. The support is characterized in that it is 
extremely economical and in that the shelf 
constraint in a horizontal direction is very 
rapid, effective, and has no need of glues and/or 
further intermediate elements. A

<CLAIMS>
An invisible support for fixing shelves to walls, 
comprising at least one horizontal element (2) 

which can be inserted in a cavity (3) in a shelf 
(1), such that the shelf is vertically constrained 

to the support (6), said support (6) being 
characterised in that it comprises at least one 

adjustable barb (4) which on assembly can be 
hidden in the cavity (3) and which interacts 

between the horizontal element (2) and at least 
one wall (5) of the cavity (3) in such a way as to 

permit free horizontal movement of the shelf (1) 
when neared to the support (6), but preventing the 

shelf (1) from returning outwardly. 
A support as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
barb (4) comprises at least one flaring element 

(7) supported to the horizontal element (2) and 
projecting towards the wall (5) such that the 

flaring element (7) horizontally contrasts the 
shelf (1) elastically in a transversal direction. 
A support as in claim 1, characterised in that the  
 

flaring element (7) is made in a single body with 
the horizontal element (2). 
A support as in claim 1, wherein the horizontal 
element (2) has a straight rod shape with a 

polygonal profile, and is insertable in a 
cylindrical cavity (3), characterised in that the 

barb (4) comprises at least one flaring element 
(7) arranged longitudinally to the horizontal 

element (2) and supported by a washer (30) 
slottable on to a pivot (31) of the horizontal 

element (2), said flaring element (7) being 
provided with one at least partially hooked end 

destined to react against the wall (5) of the 
cavity (3) in such a way as to prevent a 

backsliding of the shelf from the support (6). 
A support as in claim 1, characterised in that the 
barb (4) comprises at least one flaring element 

(7) made on a bush (36), said bush (36) being 
slidably associated to a tract (37) of the 

horizontal element (2). 
A support as in claim 2 or 3, characterised in 
that the flaring element (7) is arranged at a slot  

 
(8) made in the horizontal element (2). 
A support as in claim 4, characterised in that the 
horizontal element (2) has a channel (32) for 

housing the flaring element (7), said flaring 
element (7) engaging against the wall (5) of the 

cavity (3) and reacting elastically against a 
bottom (34) of the channel (32). 
A support as in claim 5, characterised in that the 
barb (4) has two opposite flaring elements (7). 
A support as in claim 6, characterised in that the 
slot (8) is arranged across the horizontal element 

(2).
