<ABSTRACT>
An external storage device comprises an external storage 
device main formed into a plate shape or a card shape through 

coating and sealing a storage medium series element containing 
at least a non-volatile memory device (2) by using insulator (3), and 

external connection terminals (5b) which are connected to input/output 
terminals of the storage medium series element coated 

and incorporated by the insulator (3) and which are led and 
exposed in a concaved or plane shape (5a) on a peripheral surface 

of the external storage device main.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to external storage devices capable
of recording and saving various data, a method of producing
the external storage devices, and external storage device
unit. More specifically, the invention relates to an external
storage device exchangeably used for storage equipment and
devices as an external storage medium, and a method of readily
producing the external storage device, and an effective
utilization of the external storage device.Storage devices or memory elements, which are capable of
recording and saving various data, have been utilized in two
systems, namely, one is incorporated and fixed within storage
equipment or devices, and the other is releasably or
exchangeably incorporated in the storage equipment or devices.
For the external storage devices which can optionally be
attached or detached or freely removed in the storage
equipment or devices, for example, floppy disk devices can be
attached and detached by one touch operation. Therefore, the
floppy disks being the recording mediums can separately be
used depending on purpose and object to record and save the 
data, whereby easier data reduction can advantageously be
obtained.However, a problem arises in the floppy disks described,
where the data occasionally disappears on recording or saving
the data to produce less reliability in addition to slower
access time. When producing the smaller sized floppy disks in
response to a miniaturization policy, a storing area of the
storage medium is correspondingly smaller to reduce storage
capacity, this thus limits practical use thereof.On the other hand, semiconductor memory devices used as
an external storage device such as IC memory cards can largely
solve the drawbacks in the floppy disks, where the IC memory
cards generally exhibit graded reliability of recording and
saving the data and relatively rapid access time.The IC memory cards comprise, a functional circuit in
which circuit components containing the semiconductor memory
devices or elements are mounted on substrates, a resin casing
attached therein with the functional circuit as an inside
attachment, a cover for coating and sealing both opening
surfaces of the resin casing, and external connection
terminals such as two piece connectors which are attached on
one edge of the resin casing and electrically connect the
functional circuit and the storage equipment / device.
However, the IC memory cards are assembled with a large amount
of components and parts, where a relatively complicated
structure is required with
