<ABSTRACT>
An improved vector for introducing a DNA coding sequence for a 
heterologous protein into a mammalian cell line to increase protein 

expression. The vector comprises a cDNA protein coding sequence, 
a first promoter and a downstream donor intron, the first promoter 

and downstream donor intron being located between a second promoter 
and a donor intron acceptor. In an illustrative example, the 

sequence codes for Factor VIII and high productivity of a 
transfected cell line is assured by establishing a minimum 

amplifiability index which, contrary to current practice, focuses 
on using cell lines having relatively low productivity prior to 

amplification.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field: This invention relates generally to the production 
of biologically-active proteins from genetically-engineered 
mammalian cell lines. Specifically, the invention is concerned 
with a novel vector and cell selection method which enhances cell 
line productivity. The invention is especially useful for 
increased production of recombinant Factor VIII. Prior Art: Gene amplification is a strategy which has been 
broadly applied to increase protein production in mammalian cells. 
A transcription unit (cDNA) encoding a protein of interest is 
normally linked covalently to an amplifiable marker. The 
transcription unit and marker are then co-transferred into an 
appropriate cell, followed by selection and co-amplification. The most widely used gene transfection and amplification 
strategy involves the use of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) 
expression vectors in conjunction with DHFR-deficient Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells (Kellems, Curr. Op. Biotech. 2:723-729, 
1991). A number of commercially valuable proteins including tissue 
plasminogen activator, erythropoietin, and factor VIII have been 
produced by this strategy (see U.S. 4,740,461 to Kaufman and 
Kaufman, et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 5(7): 1750-1759, 1985). Due to  
 
the presence of the endogenous DHFR gene, this strategy has 
generally not been extended to cell hosts that are not DHFR-deficient. 
However, limited success has been reported where DHFR⁺ 
cell hosts were used to express therapeutic proteins. U.S. patent 4,965,199 (Wood, et al., 1990) describes a process 
for producing factor VIII in DHFR⁺ baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21). 
This process involves (i) the co-transfection of host cells 
with a DNA sequence coding for factor VIII linked to a 2nd DNA 
sequence encoding DHFR, and a selectable marker conferring neomycin 
resistance, (ii) selection of transfectants in a selective medium 
containing G418, and (iii) amplification of G418 resistant cells in 
media containing increasing amounts of methotrexate (MTX). Wall, et al. (Gene, 81: 139-149, 1989) have reported on the 
use of the DHFR/MTX co-amplification strategy to express functional 
protein C in human 293 cells. Okamoto, et al. (Biotechnol., 8: 
550-553, 1990) have also described the amplification and expression 
of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in human lymphoid 
cells. Despite recent advances in recombinant DNA techniques, the 
derivation of recombinant cell clones with high productivity for  
 
factor VIII has remained difficult. European patent application
