<ABSTRACT>
A Karaoke apparatus in which after one Karaoke 
play was finished, a show-up effect according to the 

next Karaoke playing music piece is obtained for a 
period of time until the start of the next Karaoke 

play. Control information of a plurality of music 
pieces is previously reproduced by the reproducing 

means from the recorded information on a recording 
medium and is stored in memory. When one of the 

plurality of music pieces is selected by an operation, 
the control information corresponding to the selected 

music piece is read out from the memory and is supplied 
to the external apparatus to thereby start the 

operation. After that, the recording medium is played 
with regard to the selected music piece, thereby 

starting the reproduction of the Karaoke playing sound. 
Before the next Karaoke playing sound is generated, the 

external apparatus starts the operation according to 
the next Karaoke playing sound, so that the image of 

the selected music piece to be subsequently played is 
expressed by the external apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Karaoke
reproducing apparatus using a recording medium on which
Karaoke playing sounds of a plurality of music pieces
are recorded and reproducing the playing sound of the
selected one of the plurality of music pieces.In conventional Karaoke reproducing apparatuses (see e.g. EP-A-0303700),
external apparatuses such as illuminating apparatus,
background video image apparatus, or the like for
presenting a singing environment are used, and the
control of those apparatuses are performed in
correspondence to a Karaoke playing sound obtained by
playing a recording medium. For instance, in the case
of the illuminating apparatus, the color and
illuminance of the illumination change in accordance
with the Karaoke playing music piece. In the case of
the background video image apparatus, the background
video image of a word video image of the playing music
piece that is displayed on a display has the contents
corresponding to the contents of the playing music
piece. The term "external apparatus" is a general
denomination of apparatuses other than the apparatus
for playing the Karaoke sound. However, in conventional Karaoke reproducing
apparatuses designed to control the external apparatus
in accordance with the play of the Karaoke as mentioned
above, the external apparatus doesn't start the
operation so long as real-time data is not generated in
accordance with the play of the recording medium. After
the Karaoke play of one music piece was finished,
therefore, it takes an access time including the
exchange of the recording medium for the next Karaoke
playing music piece. A silent state continues and a
blank state appears until the start of the next Karaoke
play and the next Karaoke play is suddenly started. A
show-up effect such as to incite a pre-boom, therefore,
cannot be obtained.It is, therefore, an object of the invention to
provide a Karaoke reproducing apparatus in which after
one Karaoke play was finished, a show-up effect adapted
to the next Karaoke playing music piece can be obtained
for a period of time until the start of the next
Karaoke play.According to the present invention, the above
object is accomplished by a Karaoke reproducing
apparatus which can reproduce a Karaoke playing sound
and can control an external apparatus, wherein the
apparatus comprises: a recording medium on which at
least Karaoke playing sounds of a plurality of music 
pieces and control information of an external apparatus
of every of the plurality of music pieces have been
recorded;
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A Karaoke reproducing apparatus for reproducing a
Karaoke playing sound and controlling an external

apparatus (25, 26), comprising:

a recording medium (5) on which at least Karaoke
playing sounds of a plurality of music pieces and

control information of said external apparatus of every
said plurality of music pieces are recorded;
reproducing means (4) for reading out the recorded
information from said recording medium (5) and for

reproducing the read-out information;
memory means (13) for causing said reproducing means to
reproduce said control information of said plurality of

music pieces previously and for storing said control
information reproduced by said reproducing means (4);
means (15) for generating a music piece selecting
command indicative of one of said plurality of music

pieces in accordance with an operation; and
control means (7) for reading out the control
information of said one music piece from said memory means according to said

music piece selecting command, for supplying said
control information to said external apparatus (25, 26), and

subsequently instructing said reproducing means (4) to play
said recording medium (5) for reproducing said one music

piece according to the music piece selecting command.
