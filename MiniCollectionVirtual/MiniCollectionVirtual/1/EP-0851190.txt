<ABSTRACT>
After a running stop command is released, a pump P2 for
transferring a solution from the absorber 2 to a regenerator 3 is kept

running. The transfer of the solution permits separation of the solution
from a refrigerant during non-operation of the refrigerator. The solution

saved in the regenerator 3 remains at as a high concentration of the
absorbent as that before the end of the operation while the refrigerant is

saved in an evaporator 1. This enables the refrigerator to restart its
normal operation corresponding to an operation start command.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of stopping an
absorption refrigerator and particularly, a method of stopping an
absorption refrigerator in such a manner that the refrigerator will be able
to promptly be restarted upon switched on.In an air-cooling absorption refrigerator using water as a
refrigerant and lithium bromide as an absorbent, the absorbent in an
absorbent solution is likely to be crystallized during non-running of the
refrigerator. For preventing the crystallization of the absorbent, it is
common that, upon a stopping operation is conducted, circulation pumps
for the absorbent solution and the refrigerant are not immediately turned
off but kept running for a while to allow the absorption solution to absorb
refrigerant vapor for decreasing the concentration of the absorbent and/or
to mix the highly concentrated solution with a diluted solution for dilution
of the absorbent solution. For example, a conventional method of
stopping the operation of an absorption refrigerator is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Hei 8-226722 in which the
diluting operation is terminated when the temperature of a refrigerant
drops to a predetermined degree, instead of a known diluting operation
controlled simply with a timer, thus avoiding useless running of the
refrigerator and decreasing the consumption of electric power to minimize
the running cost. In such a conventional method of stopping the operation, the
absorbent solution is saved in a diluted state for preventing the
crystallization during stopping of the refrigerator and, when the refrigerator
is restarted, the diluted absorbent solution has to be converted by
separation of the refrigerant therefrom to a high concentration of the
solution for producing a desired level of performance. This requires a
length of time from the start up to the normal running. In addition to
taking the length of time, such a wasteful operation is needed, such that the
absorbent solution with a concentration suitable for normal running is
diluted by using an amount of energy upon stopping the refrigerator and
the solution has to be converted back by using another amount of energy
from a diluted state to its original suitable concentration when starting
again. Accordingly, the efficiency of energy consumption will be lowered.US-A-3 299 652 discloses a method of stopping an absorption refrigerator according to the preamble of claim 1.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for
stopping an absorption refrigerator in a such manner

<CLAIMS>
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator which comprises an evaporator (1) for saving a refrigerant to

produce a refrigerant vapor, an absorber (2) saving a solution containing an
absorbent and absorbing the refrigerant vapor produced in the evaporator

to generate absorption heat, a regenerator (3) for receiving the solution from
the absorber and heating it to extract the refrigerant vapor for recovering

the concentration of the absorbent in the solution, and a condenser (9) for
condensing the refrigerant vapor extracted in the regenerator and

delivering a condensed vapor to the evaporator, the method 
characterised
by
 comprising:

transferring a substantially full amount of the solution from
the absorber to the regenerator in response to an operation stop

command and then stopping the operation of the absorption
refrigerator.
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator according to claim 1, wherein a pump (P2) is mounted across a

conduit along which the solution is transferred from the absorber to the
regenerator and arranged for, when the operation stop command is

released, continuously running until the solution in the absorber drops to a
predetermined level including zero.
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator according to claim 2, wherein the continuous running of the

pump is timed with a timer (22). 
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator according to one of claims 1 through 3, wherein the refrigerant

in the condenser is transferred to the evaporator before the absorption
refrigerator completely ceases its operation.
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator according to claim 4, wherein in the transfer of the refrigerant

from the condenser to the evaporator, a substantially full amount of the
refrigerant is transferred.
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator according to claim 4, wherein a pressure reducing valve (11) is mounted

across a conduit (9a) along which the refrigerant is transferred from
the condenser to the evaporator, and the valve is arranged for, when the

operation stop command is released, opening wider than in a normal
running operation until a level of the refrigerant in the condenser drops to

a predetermined level including zero.
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator according to claim 6, wherein a time during which the pressure

reducing valve is opened wider than in the normal running operation
thereof, is set with a second timer.
A method of stopping an operation of an absorption
refrigerator according to one of claims 1 through 7, wherein the refrigerant

is trifluoroethanol and a combination of the refrigerant and the absorbent
is utilized as a medium pair for carrying out a cycle action of absorption

refrigeration.
