<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of purifying terephthalic
acid, more particularly, to a method
of purifying and recovering the thus highly purified
acid via their organic amine salts.From the standpoint of reuse of resources and
protection of environment, a variety of resin products are
in fact practically recovered and reused, or intensive
investigations are conducted for recovery and reuse of
resin products.A certain kind of polyester resins contains aromatic
dicarboxylic acids as structural units. For example, an
aromatic dicarboxylic acid such as terephthalic acid is
contained in polyethylene terephthalate resins or
polybutylene terephthalate resins, whereas naphthalene
dicarboxylic acid is contained in polyethylene naphthalene-dicarboxylate
resins. Such aromatic dicarboxylic acids
are practically recovered together with alkylene glycols
by hydrolysis of such polyester resins. However, since
molded articles of polyester resins usually contain
colorants, so that when such articles are hydrolyzed, the
recovered aromatic dicarboxylic acids are usually colored.
Hence, it is necessary that the recovered aromatic
dicarboxylic acids must be purified so that they are reused
as materials for production of polyester resins.Terephthalic acid, one of the most widely used aromatic
dicarboxylic acids as a material for production of polyester
resins, has a low vapor pressure even at a high temperature,
so that it is virtually impossible to purify the acid by 
distillation. Moreover, since the acid is substantially
insoluble in many organic solvents, it is also impossible
to purify the acid by recrystallization.However, in general, an aromatic dicarboxylic acid,
inclusive of terephthalic acid, forms a water soluble salt.
Thus, the aromatic dicarboxylic acid can be purified with
use of usual purifying means. For example, an aqueous
solution containing such a water soluble salt of the acid
is prepared and then the solution is decolored by use of
an adsorbent such as activated carbon or the salt is
recrystallized from the solution, thereby to purify the
aromatic dicarboxylic acid.As disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 44-20616,
there is already known a method to purify crude
terephthalic acid wherein the crude terephthalic acid is
reacted with ammonia to form an aqueous solution of
diammonium terephthalate, and the solution is decolored,
and is then heated to a temperature of 90-95°C so that
the salt decomposes and crystallizes as monoammonium
terephthalate. The salt is collected by filtration and
decompose
