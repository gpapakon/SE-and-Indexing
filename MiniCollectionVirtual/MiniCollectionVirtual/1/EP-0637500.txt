<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a panel (15) for fitment 
inside the passenger compartment of a vehicle, the 

process including a first stage consisting in hot 
pressing, forming and mutually joining a main supporting 

sheet (12) and a cover sheet (11); and a second stage 
consisting in hot folding and stably fixing at least one 

portion (18) of the edge (16) of the panel (15) on to 
the surface of the supporting sheet (12) facing away 

from the cover sheet (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing vehicle interior panels, e.g. automobile 
inside cover or closure panels, and more specifically 
for producing door inside panels or rear parcel shelves. 
The present invention also relates to a device 
implementing the process, and to the panel produced 
thereby. As is known, panels of the aforementioned type 
comprise a relatively rigid supporting frame to which an 
outer covering, e.g. of fabric or artificial leather, is 
applied, e.g. hot bonded, as the frame is formed; and 
the edge of the panel is then trimmed using a blade 
which provides for folding a short portion of the cover 
material about the edge of the frame. The cover material 
however, particularly if relatively soft, tends to 
shrink gradually and come away from the edge, thus 
impairing the appearance of the finished panel. Other known solutions for securing the edge of the 
cover material to the supporting frame provide for  
 
subsequently cold folding peripheral portions of the 
cover material and securing them firmly to the frame by 
means of additional elements. In addition to being more 
expensive, such solutions also involve additional 
operations, such as removal of sections of the material 
about the curved portions. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a process for producing vehicle interior panels, 
designed to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks, i.e. 
which is relatively straightforward and economical, and 
provides for preventing the cover material from coming 
away from the edge, thus ensuring a high standard of 
quality of the finished panel. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a straightforward low-cost device for 
implementing the above process, and a panel produced 
thereby. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a process for producing a panel for fitment 
inside the passenger compartment of a vehicle; 
characterized in that it comprises a first stage 
consisting in hot pressing, forming and mutually joining 
at least one main supporting sheet and a cover sheet; 
and a second stage consisting in hot folding and stably 
fixing at least one portion of the edge of the panel on 
to the surface of the supporting sheet facing away from 
the cover sheet. A number of non-limiting embodiments of the  
 
present invention will be described by way of example 
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:

A process for producing a panel (15; 15') for 
fitment inside the passenger compartment of a vehicle; 

characterized in that it comprises a first stage 
consisting in hot pressing, forming and mutually joining 

at least one main supporting sheet (12) and a cover 
sheet (11); and a second stage consisting in hot folding 

and stably fixing at least one portion (18; 18') of the
