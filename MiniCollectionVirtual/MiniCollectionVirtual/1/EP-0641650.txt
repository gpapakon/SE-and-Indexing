<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a gripper control for a front gripper which is driven in cyclical oscillation for transporting individual sheets in a sheet printing press. This control is effected by a control cam (15) which revolves singularly with a cylinder and by a cam segment (12) on which two successive, circular cam regions with a common centre-point are formed, and which is fixed on a roller lever (13) so as to be adjustable on a circular path parallel to the cam path, the movement of which roller lever is brought about by a cam roller (11) which rolls along the singularly revolving cam.

Gripper control for a pregripper which is driven 
in a cyclically oscillating manner for transporting 

single sheets in a sheet printing machine, whose pregripper 
has, at the free end of an oscillating lever 

which can be pivoted by a motor about an axis of oscillation 
which is fixed to the frame, at least one sheet 

gripper which is forcibly movable about a joint axis, 
aligned parallel to the axis of oscillation, for closing 

and opening the sheet gripper when receiving and transferring 
the sheet, by means of cams, one cam of which 

revolves in a singular manner and, in doing so, displaces 
the other cam cyclically in its position, said cam being 

attached to a roller lever which is mounted so as to be 
pivotable from a stationary position and whose cam roller 

bears against said cam, the positions of the cams which 
are adjustable relative to one another determining the 

point in time of closure and the point in time of opening 
of the gripper, characterized in that the displaceable 

cam is designed as a cam segment (12) which has two 
successive circular cam regions with a different radius 

(R1, R2) and a common centre point and is adjustable 
relative to the roller lever (13) bearing the cam so as 

to be equidistant relative to the circular cam regions, 
the singularly revolving cam (15) bringing about the 

gripper opening and the cam segment (12) bringing about 
the gripper closure. 
Gripper control according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the roller lever (13), which is moved by 

the singularly revolving cam (15), and the cam segment 
(12) attached thereto engage in one another with holding  

 
members (17) of circular arc-shaped design, which are 

adjustable relative to one another and can be connected 
fixedly to one another. 
Gripper control according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the centre point of the circular 

arc-shaped cam regions (R1, R2) of the cam segment (12) 
lies on the axis of oscillation (5), and the cam (15) 

shifts the centre point of the radii (R1, R2). 
Gripper control according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the sheet gripper (6), mounted on 

the oscillating lever (3) so as to be movable on a 
gripper shaft (9), is fixedly connected to a roller lever 

(10) which is supported against the cam flank of the cam 
segment (12) by means of a cam roller (11) mounted 

rotatably at its free end.
