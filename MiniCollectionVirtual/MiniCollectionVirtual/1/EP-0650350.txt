<ABSTRACT>
A menstrual garment (28) for maintaining a catamenial pad (26) in a pudendal region of a female wearer includes an outer layer (30) having first and second leg openings formed therein for receiving the legs of a female wearer. An inner layer (32) is provided between the first and second leg openings and is attached to the outer layer. A lifting mechanism (42, 112, 200) is located between the inner and outer layers for lifting a catamenial pad worn by the female into her gluteal groove and against her perineum. In one preferred form, the lifting mechanism is an elastic cinch (42) disposed between the inner and outer layers. In an alternative preferred form, the lifting mechanism is a stitched seam (112) that is sewn into the inner layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to feminine menstrual protection devices
and, more particularly, to menstrual shorts incorporating a lifting mechanism
for positioning a catamenial pad in the pudendal region of the female wearer.As is known, disposable catamenial pads are commercially
available in a wide variety of configurations for the specific purpose of
absorbing and retaining menstrual fluids and other vaginal discharges.
Regardless of the specific configuration, all catamenial pads are intended to
isolate the discharged menses for preventing the undergarments, clothing,
bedding etc. surrounding the disposable article from becoming soiled.
Unfortunately, a primary failure mechanism associated with catamenial pads
is leakage of menses from a rear portion thereof due to poor fit in the gluteal
groove and against the perineum of the female wearer.To provide additional protection against leakage, it is known to
use a washable and reusable garment, such as a menstrual short or panty,
in combination with a disposable catamenial pad. For example, U.S. Patent
3,489,149 to Larson discloses a washable menstrual panty having a small
pocket in the crotch area for retaining a disposable catamenial pad. Since
the menses must initially flow through a layer of material forming the pocket
to reach the catamenial pad, removal of the soiled catamenial pad can be
distasteful, difficult and unsanitary. While a new pad can be inserted into the
pocket, the garment is already soiled and would typically be changed. Also,
the pocket may not accommodate the varied sizes of catamenial pads
currently on the market. Finally, the menstrual panty is not adapted to
deliberately position the catamenial pad for preventing leakage of menses
from the rear portion thereof. Various other menstrual shorts or panties are known which also
fail to adequately address the need for properly positioning and retaining the
disposable catamenial pad in the pudendal region of the female wearer. For
example, U.S. Patent 4,560,381 to Southwell describes a mesh-like outer
panty shell with a thick inner layer of absorbent material in the lower crotch
area of the panty. The inner layer of absorbent material includes a
depression for receiving and positioning a catamenial pad. In U.S. Patent
4,813,950 to Branch, a washable menstrual panty is disclosed as having an
outer lining of spandex, soft tricot, etc. and an inner lining of soft plastic film
to prevent passage of menses therethrough.
