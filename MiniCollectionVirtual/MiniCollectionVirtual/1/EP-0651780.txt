<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to a process for sanitary cleaning with a sanitary cleaner in liquid or solid form containing germicidal organic substances in a quantity of at least some '.5 g/kg sanitary cleaner, conventional scale-removing water-soluble acids, germ-conveying organic materials resistant to the scale-removing water-soluble acids in a quantity of at least 10 mg/kg sanitary cleaner and possibly other additives. After dilution or washing, the action of the germs decomposing the organic substance in the water is promoted. As germ-conveying organic substance, the sanitary cleaner contains a compound of the formula (I): R1R2N-CO-NR3R4 in which R1 to R4 are mutually independently open-chained or cyclised and may be: hydrogen, a lower alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a cyclo-alkyl group with 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl group in the form of a phenyl or naphthyl rest, an aralkyl group with 7 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkylaryl group with 7 to 18 carbon atoms or an O, S or N-containing heterocyclic group with 2 to 5 carbon atoms. This process and the sanitary cleaner used therein promote the respiratory activity of microflora in the communal waste water. This also results in the desirable germicidal function in the initial operating phase of a sanitary cleaner, e.g. in a toilet pan.

Process for sanitary cleaning with a sanitary cleaner in liquid or solid 
form having a content of bactericidal, organic substances in a quantity of at 

least 0.5 g/kg of sanitary cleaner, of conventional scale-removing, water-soluble 
acids, of germ-conveying, organic substances resistant to the scale-removing, 

water-soluble acid in a quantity of at least 10 mg/kg of sanitary 
cleaner and optionally of further additives in which, following the dilution or 

washing, the action of the germs decomposing the organic substance of the 
water is promoted, characterized in that the sanitary cleaner, as a germ-conveying, 

organic substance, contains an open-chain or cyclic compound of 
formula 


R
1
R
2
N-CO-NR
3
R
4
 
in which R
1
 to R
4
, in each case independent of one another, are present in open-chain 
or cyclized form and can have the following meaning:
 
hydrogen, a lower alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group with 

3 to 6 carbon atoms, an aryl group in the form of a phenyl or naphthyl residue, 
an aralkyl group w
ith 7 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkylaryl group with 7 to 18 
carbon atoms or an 0, S or N-containing, heterocyclic group with 2 to 5 carbon 

atoms,
 
and when use is made of benzoic acid as the bactericidal organic substance use 

is made of a scale-removing, water-soluble, organic acid differing therefrom. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that citric acid is used as 
the scale-removing, water-soluble, organic acid. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the radicals R
1
, R
2
, 
R
3
 and R
4
 are hydrogen and consequently the compound of formula (I) is urea. 
Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the concentration of the bactericidal compound of formula (I) in the 

sanitary cleaner is 10 mg/kg to 50 g/kg. 
Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that for optimizing its action, addition takes place to the sanitary cleaner of 

further germ-conveying, organic substances in the form of amino acids, orotic 
acid or their salts and/or vitamins.  

 
Process according to at least one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the sanitary cleaner contains one or more bactericidal, organic substances 

in a quantity of 0.5 to 150 g/kg of sanitary cleaner. 
Sanitary cleaner containing one or more bactericidal, organic substances 
in a concentration of at least 0.5 g/kg of sanitary cleaner and a germ-conveying 

organic substance or substances resistant to the scale-removing, 
water-soluble acid in the form of a compound of formula (I) in a quantity of 

at least 10 mg/kg of sanitary cleaner and in the case where benzoic acid is 
used as the bactericidal, organic substance, use is made of a scale-removing, 

water-soluble, organic acid differing therefrom. 
Sanitary cleaner according to claim 7, characterized in that it also contains 
a germ-conveying, water-soluble protein as a foam carrier. 
Sanitary cleaner according to claim 8, characterized in that it contains 
2 to 30 g of water-soluble protein/kg of sanitary cleaner. 
Sanitary cleaner according to claim 8 or 9, characterized in that the 
water-soluble protein is water-soluble whey protein. 
Sanitary cleaner according to at least one of the claims 7 to 10, characterized 
in that the scale-removing, water-soluble acid or acids, the bactericidal, 

organic substance or substances and/or the germ-conveying, organic substance 
or substances occur naturally.
