<ABSTRACT>
A circuit that increases the efficiency of a radio frequency mobile unit
(10) is disclosed. When the mobile telephone unit is within a certain signal strength

range of the base station, the power amplifying circuit (16) is removed from the
transmission circuitry (by 20,22). However, when the signal strength between the

base station and the mobile unit is low, the power amplifier is turned on and the
transmitted signal (from 14) is amplified before being sent over the mobile unit's

antenna (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio frequency (RF)
power level control circuit and, more particularly, to a
circuit for increasing the efficiency of the power amplifier
in mobile telephone units.Compact size and low weight are desirable features in
cellular and other portable radio telephones (hereinafter
referred to as mobile units). The power needed to operate
a mobile unit is usually drawn from a battery. Since the
battery is typically the largest and heaviest device in a
mobile unit, decreasing the power needs of the mobile unit
would permit smaller batteries to be used, thereby
decreasing the overall size and weight of the mobile unit.In all radio frequency (RF) communication systems, the
power needed to transmit a signal consumes a large
proportion of the available energy. An increase in the
efficiency of the transmitting circuit would decrease the
power consumption, thereby decreasing the size of the
battery needed to power the mobile unit. In addition, low
power consumption due to higher efficiency reduces the heat
generated due to internal power dissipation.The transmitter circuit of a typical mobile unit
includes an RF source, a driver amplifier circuit, a power
amplifier circuit and an antenna. (The driver amplifier and
the power amplifier are sometimes referred to together as a
two-stage power amplifier circuit.)When the typical mobile unit is active, the driver and
power amplifier are continuously on. Applicants have
recognized, however, that the power needed to transmit a 
signal from the mobile unit to a base station does not
always require the full operating power of the driver and
power amplifiers. That is, it is estimated that for many
applications the power amplifier is actually only required
approximately twenty percent of the time (e.g., near the
fringe of a cell, behind a structure, etc.) Accordingly,
during the majority of the time the mobile unit is in use,
the driver amplifier alone can produce a signal strong
enough so that it will be picked up by the base station.Presently, several techniques have been devised that
attempt to increase the efficiency of power amplifiers.
These techniques include circuits that control the drain or
collector supply voltage of a linear power amplifier;
utilization of quasi-linear amplifiers; and utilization of
non-linear compensation circuits (e.g., a feedback
controlled predistortion circuit). However, each of the
aforementioned techniques require additional -- and usually
complex -- circuitry and have difficulty maintaining the
desired
