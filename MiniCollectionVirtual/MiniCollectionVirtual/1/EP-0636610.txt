<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel piperidine compounds, to their use as light
stabilizers, heat stabilizers and oxidation stabilizers for organic materials, in particular
synthetic polymers, and to the organic materials thus stabilized.Various patents claim the use of ester derivatives of polyalkyl-4-piperidinols as stabilizers
for synthetic polymers, in particular the Patents DE 3.412.227, US 3.640.928, 3.840.494,
4.021.432, 4.198.334, 4.855.434 and SU Patent 1.051.075.2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4-piperidyl derivatives are also disclosed in DE-A-27 55 340,
JP-A-Sho 63/135 440, US-A-4 894 399, EP-A-226 538, US-A-3 705 166,
EP-A-63 544 and EP-A-1 835.The present invention relates to novel compounds of the formula (I)

in which
R1 is hydrogen, C1-C8alkyl, O, OH, CH2CN, C1-C18alkoxy, C5-C12cycloalkoxy,
C3-C6alkenyl,
or aliphatic C1-C8acyl, andR2 is hydrogen or C1-C8alkyl.Examples of alkyl having not more than 8 carbon atoms are methyl, ethyl, propyl,
isopropyl, butyl, 2-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, 2-pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl.Examples of C1-C18alkoxy are methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy,
pentoxy, isopentoxy, hexoxy, heptoxy, octoxy, decyloxy, dodecyloxy, tetradecyloxy,
hexadecyloxy and octadecyloxy. Preferred examples are C6-C12alkoxy, in particular
heptoxy and octoxy.Examples of C5-C12cycloalkoxy R1 are cyclopentoxy, cyclohexoxy, cycloheptoxy,
cyclooctoxy, cyclodecyloxy and cyclododecyloxy. Cyclopentoxy and cyclohexoxy are
preferred.Examples of C3-C6alkenyl are allyl, 2-methylallyl, butenyl and hexenyl. Allyl is preferred.Examples of aliphatic C1-C8acyl are C1-C8alkanoyl or C3-C8-alkenoyl, for example,
acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, pentanoyl, hexanoyl, heptanoyl, octanoyl,
2-ethylhexanoyl, acryloyl and crotonyl. Acetyl is preferred. Preferred definitions of R1 are hydrogen, C1-C4alkyl, OH, C6-C12alkoxy,
C5-C8cycloalkoxy, allyl or acetyl, in particular hydrogen or methyl.Those compounds of the formula (I) are preferred in which R2 is hydrogen or C1-C6alkyl.Those compounds of the formula (I) are particularly preferred in which R2 is hydrogen or
C1-C4alkyl.Those compounds of the formula (I) are of special interest in which R2 is hydrogen or
methyl.Those compounds of the formula (I) are of particular interest in which R1 is hydrogen,
methyl or cyclohexyloxy, and R2 is hydrogen.The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by reacting, in the appropriate
molar ratios, a compound of the formula (IIIa)

in which R3' is
C1-C18alkyl, C5-C12cycloalkyl
