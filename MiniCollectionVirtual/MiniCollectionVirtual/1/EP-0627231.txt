<ABSTRACT>
Delivery devices which include a beneficial agent and an 
activating mechanism in separate compartments separated by a moveable 

partition are designed to deliver the beneficial agent in a pulsatile manner 
through an orifice. The pulsatile delivery is achieved by a band of 

resilient material which is placed over the orifice. The resilient material 
is sufficiently tight to substantially seal the orifice when the pressure 

within the device is below a threshold level while at the same time being 
capable of being stretched when the internal pressure exceeds the thre
shold.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention lies in the field of controlled- or sustained-
release systems for the delivery of drugs, nutrients and the like. In
particular, this invention relates to delivery systems which are generally
in the form of capsules designed to release a beneficial agent through an
orifice in the capsule, the release occurring gradually as the result of
internal pressure. This type of delivery system is e.g. disclosed
in WO 92/16194.Osmotic delivery capsules, commonly referred to as "osmotic
pumps," function by virtue of walls which selectively pass water into the
capsule reservoir. Absorption of water by the capsule through these walls
is driven by a water-attracting agent in the capsule interior which creates
osmotic pressure across the capsule wall. The water-attracting agent may be
the beneficial agent itself whose controlled release is sought, but in most
cases, it is a separate agent specifically selected for its ability to draw
water, this separate agent being isolated from the beneficial agent at one
end of the capsule. In either case, the structure of the capsule wall does
not permit the capsule to expand, and as a result, the water uptake causes
discharge of the beneficial agent through an orifice in the capsule at the
same rate that water enters by osmosis.The terms "osmotically effective" and "osmotically active" are
used in the literature to characterize the water-attracting agent which
drives the osmotic flow. Certain agents of this type are termed
"osmagents," which denotes water-soluble compounds to which the capsule wall
is not permeable. Osmotically effective agents which are polymeric species
are termed "osmopolymers," which term denotes water-swellable polymers.
Osmagents and osmopolymers may be used individually in a capsule or they may 
be present as a mixture of the two. In cases where the
osmotically active agent is separated from the beneficial
agent by a movable partition or piston, the osmotically
active agent and the compartment in which it resides may
be referred to as an "osmotic engine".Many protocols or situations require, or would
benefit from, an intermittent or pulsatile release of the
beneficial agent from the capsule. This is true of a
variety of drugs, medicaments and nutriments, in a range
of environments extending from veterinary medicine to
human drug administrations, and to hobby situations such
as fish tanks. The reasons vary, and may address such
needs as mimicking a natural intermittent physiological
release, allowing for periods of restoration of certain
bodily

<CLAIMS>
A delivery device (11) for the pulsatile delivery of
a beneficial agent (14,72) to an environment of use, the

device comprising:

an enclosure (13) having an inner wall surface of
generally uniform internal cross section along the

longitudinal direction, having first and second
ends and an exit orifice (19,91) at or near said

first end;
a partition (17,72) dividing the interior of said
enclosure into a first compartment for retaining a

beneficial agent (14,74) and a second compartment
retaining an activating mechanism (15,76), said

first and second compartments being adjacent to
said first and second ends respectively, said

partition being capable of moving within said
enclosure; and
characterised by
 a closure means comprising a band of
resilient material (21,32,96) on the exterior of said

enclosure and covering said exit orifice, said resilient
material being sufficiently tight to seal or

substantially seal said orifice while at the same time 
being capable of being stretched in response to pressure

generated by said activating mechanism, such that in use
when a threshold pressure is reached the closure means

is forced open, thereby releasing a volume of beneficial
agent into the environment of use, which decreases said

pressure in the enclosure, and allows the closure means
to return to the closed position, thereby beginning a

further cycle of pressure build-up which results in
pulsatile delivery of the beneficial agent.
A device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said partition
(72) is comprised of first (73) and second (75) members

longitudinally arranged in said enclosure and joined to
each other by compressible means (77), said first member

positioned closest to said first end of said enclosure
and said second member positioned closest to said second

end of said enclosure, and further comprising resistance
means operative between said first member and said

enclosure and said second member and said enclosure,
constructed so that said second member moves

longitudinally inside said enclosure with substantially
less resistance from said enclosure than imposed on said

first member.
A device as claimed in claims 1 or 2 wherein the
internal cross-section of said enclosure is locally

varied at discrete intervals along the longitudinal 
direction, thereby providing a plurality of resistance

means adapted to prevent movement of said partition past
each resistance means towards said first end of said

enclosure until a threshold pressure is reached in said

second compartment, said threshold pressure being greater
than that required to stretch said orifice closure means,

such that in use said activating mechanism generates an
increasing pressure in said second compartment which acts

to move said partition towards said exit orifice, whereby
said partition engages against a resistance means,

thereby causing a pressure build-up in said second
compartment, which pressure build-up continues until a

threshold pressure is reached, which threshold pressure
forces said partition past said resistance means towards

the next resistance means, thereby forcing said closure
means to open, releasing a volume of beneficial agent

corresponding to the volume swept out by the partition
as it moves from said resistance means to be released

into the aqueous environment of use, where upon said
pressure is substantially released, allowing the closure

means to return to the closed position, whereupon a
further cycle of pressure build-up begins which results

in pulsatile delivery of the beneficial agent as said
partition moves past each resistance means.
A device as claimed in claim 3 wherein the resistance
means include at least one indentation (79) in said 

inner wall surface and said partition includes at least
one protrusion (78) adapted to engage with said

indentations.
A device as claimed in claim 3 wherein the
resistance means include at least one protrusion on said

inner wall surface, and said partition includes at least
one indentation adapted to engage with said protrusions.
A device as previously claimed wherein said
environment of use is an aqueous environment and said

activating mechanism comprises an osmotic engine in said
second compartment, at least a portion of said second

compartment wall (12,85) being permeable to a fluid of
the aqueous environment of use, said portion being

substantially impermeable to the osmotic agent.
A device as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5 wherein
the activating mechanism is selected from the group

consisting of a thermal system, a mechanical system, a
system dependent on vapour pressure of fluid, a system

dependent on chemical or electrochemical reactions, an
elastomeric system, a spring-loaded chamber or piston,

and a system dependent on gravity.
A device as previously claimed wherein said resilient
material is an elastomer. 
A device according to claim 8 wherein said elastomer
is injection mouldable.
A device as claimed in any preceding claim wherein
a trough (20,30,95) formed in the outer surface of the

side wall of said enclosure near said first end and
encircling said enclosure retains said band of resilient

material (21,32,96) in place and wherein said orifice is
located inside said trough.
A device as claimed in claim 10 wherein said band
of resilient material is a torroidal ring (32) and said

trough is a circumferential groove of arcuate cross-section
(30).
A device as previously claimed which further
comprises a density element.
A device as claimed in claim 2 wherein said
compressible means (77) is comprised of a compressible

fluid or a closed cell resilient foam spring.
A method of delivery of a beneficial agent in a
pulsatile manner to an environment of use, said method

comprising placing into said environment a delivery
device according to any of the preceding claims and

activating the activating mechanism of the device.
