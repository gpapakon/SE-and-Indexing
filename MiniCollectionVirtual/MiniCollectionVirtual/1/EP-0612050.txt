<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to accurately 
detect vehicles even under special conditions where vehicles go 

side by side, a motorcycle passes another vehicle in a traffic 
jam, or a shadow is cast on the road surface. 
The vehicle detecting system comprises a one dimension 
CCD camera 2 mounted above a road surface so as to provide one 

dimension light amount signal in the lane width direction from 
above the road surface and intermittent markings 6 disposed in 

the field of view of the one dimension CCD camera. When a 
vehicle 3 enters the field of view of the one dimension CCD 

camera 2, the modulation of one dimension light amount signal 
is disturbed. Therefore, a signal processing device 5 detects 

the vehicle on the basis of the output signal of the one 
dimension CCD camera 2 by checking the disturbance of 

modulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle detecting 
system which is used for toll machines for toll roads and for 
traffic equipment for traffic survey, etc. There are three conventional systems in which passing 
vehicles on the road are detected and counted from above the 
road surface: With this system, a piezoelectric transducer which 
transmits and receives ultrasonic wave 101A is mounted above 
the road surface to detect the distance to the road surface. 
When a vehicle 103 passes through as shown in Fig. 23, the 
length of time taken for reflected echo 104 to return becomes 
short, so that the presence of the vehicle 103 can be detected. With this system, the frequency of reflected wave 
corresponding to the transmitted microwave is measured. The 
wave reflected back from a passing vehicle is subjected to 
doppler shift (frequency shift), while the wave reflected back 
from the road surface is not subjected to frequency shift.  
 
Therefore, the passing of a vehicle can be detected by 
detecting the frequency shift. This system monitors the illuminance of road surface 102 
by using a photosensor 105. When a vehicle 103 passes through, 
the system detects the vehicle 103 because the roof paint color 
of the vehicle is different from the color of road surface. 
With the optical system, the field of view can be reduced by 
using an optical lens, or multiple detection can be carried out 
by using an array of photosensors. The above-described conventional vehicle detecting 
techniques pose the following problems: In the ultrasonic and microwave systems, long wavelength 
increases the beam width, so that the system widely covers the 
lane under the mounting position. Therefore, even if a small 
vehicle 103 such as a motorcycle passes through anywhere on the 
lane just under the sensor, the system can detect the vehicle. Thus, these systems have an advantage of covering the 
entire width of one lane with one sensor, but they cannot count 
a plurality of motorcycles separately when the motorcycles go 
side by side on the same lane. Also, these systems cannot 
detect a motorcycle passing the side of a truck on a jammed 
road. As described above, the system using ultrasonic wave or 
microwave has a limitation in accurate detection of passing 
vehicles.  
 Such miscounting is not permissible when the system is 
applied to a toll machine on a toll road, though it does not 
present a particularly big problem when the system is used for 
traffic survey to control the signal lights at intersections. The
