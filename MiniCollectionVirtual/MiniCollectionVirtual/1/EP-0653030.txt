<ABSTRACT>
Die Erfindung bezieht sich auf ein Verfahren und eine Vorrichtung zum kontrollierten Verspannen einer Stopfbuchse (12, 20, 22). Erfindungsgemäss erfolgt dies dadurch, dass die Stopfbuchspackung (20) zur Erstverdichtung mit einer vorgegebenen Maximalpresskraft beaufschlagt wird, dass die Presskraft (F) sodann mehrfach zwischen der Maximalpresskraft und einer vorgegebenen Minimalpresskraft variiert wird und dass die Packung abschliessend unter einer vorgegebenen Nennpresskraft komprimiert und in diesem Zustand in der Kammer (12) eingespannt wird. Während der Variation der Presskraft (F) wird der zugehörige Spannweg (s) der Packung (20) gemessen und unter Bildung eines Kraft-Weg-Diagramms als Eichkurve registriert. Die Nennpresskraft kann dann durch Kompression der Packung anhand der Eichkurve durch Messung des Spannwegs eingestellt werden.

Process for the controlled prestressing of a stuffing-box 
or seal packing (20) where the seal packing is 

arranged in a chamber (12) open on one side and bounded 
by a chamber bottom (14) and a preferably cylindrical 

chamber wall (16), is preferably traversed axially by a 
spindle (18), is actable upon with an axial pressure 

force (F) from the opening side in the direction of the 
chamber bottom (14) and compressible along a spanning 

path (s) (9), and is pressable with sealing effect
