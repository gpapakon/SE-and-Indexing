In accordance with the invention, an optical switching device (9)
comprises a light-reflecting mirror (10) containing a magnetic component

(11) coupled to a substrate (12). One or more programmable magnets
(14A,14B,14C) are provided for moving the mirror by interacting with the

magnetic component (11). The programmable magnets move the mirrors between
or among selected positions and then maintain the mirror position

without continuous power. Exemplary cross connects and 2x2 switches are
described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to improved optical switches for altering light
transmission paths, and, in particular, to magnetically programmable and
latchable optical switches.In modem lightwave telecommunication systems such as wavelength-division-multiplexed
(WDM) optical fiber systems, it is often necessary to switch
the path of transmitted light. A number of different approaches have been
utilized. Switching has been effected by mechanical movement of optical fibers
(see P. G. Hale et al., Electronic Lett., vol. 12, p. 388, 1976, and Y. Ohmori et
al., Apol. Optics, vol. 17, p. 3531, 1978). Switching can also be based Faraday
rotation (see M. Shirasaki et al., Appl. Optics, Vol. 23, p. 3271, 1984).Switching based on reflecting mirrors is particularly attractive for
communication systems but has not yet achieved its potential. (see Tanaka et
al. US Patent No. 4498730, L.Y. Lin et al, IEEE Photonics Technology Lett.,
Vol. 10, p. 525, 1998, R.A. Miller et al., Optical Eng., Vol.36, p. 1399, 1997,
and by J.W. Judy et al., Sensors and Actuators, Vol. A53, p. 392, 1996).
Switches using reflecting mirrors are convenient in that they use free-space
light transmission and are potentially expandable to a large-scale optical
crossconnect system. They typically employ electrostatic, piezoelectric or
electromagnetic actuation means to move or rotate the mirrors and alter the
light paths. The problem with these devices is that they either require the use
of continuous application of power to maintain the shifted mirror position or
their position is unstable. For example electrostatic devices are prone to
charge build up and leakage, and hence are very sensitive to environment.
Accordingly there is a need for latchable optical switches in which power is not 
required once the light path is shifted to a desired direction and for which the
latched position is stably maintained.JP 08-271811 discloses an optical switch using latchable magnets to switch a
pivotally mounted mirror from a first position where it does not reflect input
light to a second position where it does reflect input light. The position of the
pivotal mirror are constrained by positive stops.The present invention provides an optical switching/attenuator device comprising at least
one optical input path, one or more output paths disposed for receiving light
from the input path, a light reflecting mirror including a magnetic component,
the mirror being movably coupled to a substrate and one or more programmable,
latchable magnets for interacting with the
