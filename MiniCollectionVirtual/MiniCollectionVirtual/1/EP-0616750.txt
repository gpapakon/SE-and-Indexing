<ABSTRACT>
In a cellular radio-telephone system (50), a method of selecting an appropriate handoff target where the timing advance of a mobile has exceeded a timing advance threshold, the bit error rate has risen above a BER threshold, or the signal level has fallen below an RSSI threshold. The method includes discarding signal measurements of inappropriate base sites or base sites at excessive distance and performing calculations on the remaining measurements to select an appropriate handoff target.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to communication systems and more specifically to
cellular communication systems.Cellular communication systems are known. Such systems are, typically,
comprised of a number of cells, each having a service coverage area, and a
number of cellular telephones (communication units). The service coverage
areas of adjacent cells may be arranged to partially overlap in such a manner as
to provide a substantially continuous coverage area in which a communication
unit receiving service from one cell may be handed off to an adjacent cell with no
interruption in service. The Groupe Special Mobile (GSM) Pan-European digital
cellular system, as specified in GSM recommendations available from the
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is an example of just
such a system.A cell's radio coverage is provided by a base transceiver station (BTS).
Each BTS may contain one or more transceivers (TRX) which can simultaneously
receive on one frequency and transmit on another. Communication between a
BTS and a mobile communication unit (or mobile station) (MS) typically occurs
using a portion of a pair of frequencies (transmit and receive) temporarily
assigned in support of the communication transaction at the BTS.The pair of frequencies assigned for use at the remote site are typically
referred to as a radio channel. Downlink transmissions (from BTS to MS) on the
radio channel occur on a first frequency of the pair of frequencies. Uplink
transmissions (from MS to BTS) on the radio channel occurs on the second
frequency of the pair of frequencies.The GSM system is a TDM/TDMA system providing eight full duplex signal
paths (8 TDM slots per TDM frame) on each radio channel. A single, primary
radio channel assigned to a BTS, by virtue of its being time multiplexed, can
support up to seven full rate duplex traffic users (speech or data) in addition to a
multiplexed common control channel within the eight TDM slots. Additional,
secondary radio channels assigned to the same cell can provide a full
complement of eight full rate traffic users (in the 8 TDM slots) per radio channel,
since the control channel within the primary radio channel can control allocation
of communication resources on secondary radio channels. Transmissions (control or speech and/ or data traffic) from a BTS to an MS,
on the downlink, occupy a first TDM slot (downlink slot) on a first frequency of a
radio channel and transmissions from a communication unit to a BTS, on the
uplink, occupy a second TDM slot (uplink slot) on

A method of selecting a target BTS for a handoff in a cellular communication
system which includes a serving BTS and a plurality of further BTS's, each having a

single directional antenna, such method including the steps of:

scanning for signals transmitted by the BTS's included in the system and upon
detection, measuring and reporting a
RSSI value of each of the detected signals, thereby defining an initial set of
BTS's,

And 
characterised by
 the further steps of;

A) preselecting from the initial set, as potential target BTSs, BTSs which
are adjacent to the serving BTS (23) and whose antennas are

directionally opposed to the directional antenna of the serving BTS;
B) identifying reported RSSI values of the potential target BTSs;
C) calculating a power budget value based upon the reported RSSI values
for each of the potential target BTSs with previously identified reported RSSI

values; and
D) selecting, as the target BTS, the potential target BTS with the largest
power budget value.
The method of claim 1 wherein the step of selecting the target BTS further
includes the step of deferring handoff upon occasion that the reported RSSI value of the

serving BTS exceeds the reported RSSI value of the target BTS.
The method of any preceding claim wherein the step of selecting the target BTS
further includes the step of deferring handoff upon occasion that the power budget value

of the target BTS does not exceed a threshold value.
The method of any preceding claim, further including the step of handing off a
mobile station to the target BTS.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the step of identifying reported
RSSI values of potential target BTSs further includes the step of only identifying

reported RSSI values of potential target BTSs adjacent to a reporting co-sited BTS.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the step of identifying reported
RSSI values further includes the step of comparing the RSSI value of two co-sited BTSs

prior to further limiting the potential handoff targets to the adjacent BTSs of the co-sited
BTS with the proportionally larger RSSI value.
