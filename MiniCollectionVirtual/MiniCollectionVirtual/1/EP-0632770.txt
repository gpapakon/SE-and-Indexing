<CLAIMS>
An electromagnetic valve, in particular, for hydraulic 
braking systems with slip control, wherein a valve support 

member (5) accommodating a valve sleeve (24) is fixed in a 
housing bore of a valve-accommodating member (8), with a 

hold-on magnet (22) enclosed by the valve sleeve (24) 
performing a stroke in response to an electrically 

energizable magnetic coil (21) provided on the valve sleeve 
(24) so that a valve needle (2) formed to the hold-on magnet 

(22) and having a valve closure member, by way of a valve 
seat member (1) retained within the valve support member 

(5), is able to control a pressure fluid connection between 
at least one first and one additional pressure fluid 

passageway (9, 9'), and including a check valve function 
integrated between the two pressure fluid passageways (9, 

9') in the valve support member (5), and the valve seat 
member (1) retained on a housing stop (15) of the valve 

support member (5) being adapted to be shifted coaxially 
with respect to the valve needle (2) during pressure 

decrease between the first and the second pressure fluid 
passageway (9, 9') in the valve support member (5), and the 

pressure fluid passageway which is closed by the valve 

needle (2) in the valve seat member (1) is opened due to the 
electromagnetic energization of the valve, and both pressure 

fluid passageways (9, 9') are interconnected,
 
characterized in that the valve seat member (1), as a hollow 

cylindical part, includes an internal annular groove (17) in 
which a cap-shaped spreadable diaphragm member (3) is 

engaged which is made from a thin-press part, in that a 
recess is provided on the periphery of the valve support  

 
member (5) at the level of the valve closure member, which 

recess, along with the valve-accommodating member (8), forms 
an annular housing chamber accommodating an annular filter 

element (11), in that a plate filter element (13) is 
arranged on the valve support member (5) on the side of the 

valve seat member (1) remote from the valve closure member, 
in that a compression spring (6) is supported on a stop part 

(14) arranged in front of the plate filter element (13) and 
retains the valve seat member (1) having the diaphragm 

member (3) on the housing stop (15) in the 
electromagnetically non-actuated open position of the valve, 

and in that the valve support member (5) is fixed within the 
housing bore of the valve-accommodating member (8) in a 

pressure-fluid-tight manner. 
An electromagnetic valve as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the enlarged opening of the cap of the 

valve seat member (1) and of the diaphragm member (3) is 
provided on the front side facing away from the valve needle 

(2). 
An electromagnetic valve as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that the valve seat member (1) with the 

front face thereof, under the effect of the compression 
spring (6), is movable into sealing abutment with a bore 

step (7) of the valve support member (5).
