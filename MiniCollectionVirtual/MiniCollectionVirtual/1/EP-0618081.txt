<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal-transfer image-recording 
method capable of providing a recorded image with a 
high resolving power. Thermal-transfer recording methods have included, 
conventionally, a process in which a thermal-transfer 
recording element comprising a base member provided thereon 
with a thermally-fusible colorant layer or a colorant layer 
containing a thermally-sublimable dye is made opposite to an 
image-receiving element, and a heat source controlled by 
an electric signal sent from a thermal head or an electricity 
feeding head is brought into pressure contact from the ink 
sheet, i.e., the recording element, so that an image can be 
transferred and then recorded. A thermal-transfer recording 
has the advantages that noiseless operation, 
maintenance-free, low cost, easy colored recording and  
 
digital recording can be performed, so that thermal 
recording has been utilized in various fields such as a 
variety of printers, recorders, facsimiles and the terminals 
for computers. In medical and printing fields, on the other hand, there 
have recently been the demands for a recording process capable 
of performing the so-called digital recording in which a high 
resolving powder, a high-speed recording and an image 
processing can be provided. However, in the thermal-transfer 
recording processes in which a conventional thermal head or an 
electricity feeding head has been used as a heat source, an 
exothermic element has been hardly able to have any high 
density and any highly resolving image, because of the life of 
the exothermic element of a head. For solving the above-mentioned problems, there have been 
proposed for a thermal-recording technique in which laser beam 
is used as the heat source, in Japanese Patent Publication 
Open to Public Inspection (hereinafter referred to as JP OPI 
Publication) Nos. 49-15437/1974, 49-17743/1974, 57-87399/1982 
and 59-143659/1984. In a thermal recording technique in which 
laser beam is used as the heat source, the resolving power can 
be enhanced by narrowing the laser spot down. However, when 
recording an image with a laser beam, the recording time cannot 
be shortened unless the spots of the recording medium are 
scanned at a high speed, because it has been usual that the 
recording is carried out by scanning minute spots. In this  
 
case, it is generally disadvantageous to improve a recording 
speed, as compared to the case where a flood exposure is made 
or a line thermal head is used. It is also general that a 
heating given
