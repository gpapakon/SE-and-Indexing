<ABSTRACT>
This diesel particulate filter comprises of a composite 
filter plate(1) composed of thin filter plates(2) formed out 

of ceramic fiber, and a laticed heating wire(4), and metal 
nets(3). The composite filter plate(1) is bent into a 

bellows-like structure so as to increase a cross-sectional 
area of an exhaust gas passage. The latticed heating wire(4) 

is formed to a current self-controlling type heating 
wire out of a material containing Ni as a main component the 

resistance value of which increases as the temperature 

rises. The particulates collected by the thin filter plates(2) 
are burnt by supplying an electric current to the 

latticed heating wire(4). When a high-temperature region 
occurs on the thin filter plates(2), the level of an 

electric current flowing to the portion of the latticed 
heating wire(4) which corresponds to the same region is 

reduced. Consequently, all the regions of the thin filter 
plates(2) are heated at a uniform temperature, and the 

melting and breakage of the thin filter plates(2) do not 
occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a diesel particulate 
filter capable of purifying an exhaust gas by 
collecting particulates contained in an exhaust gas 
discharged from a diesel engine, and burning the same 
by heating. The combustion of a diesel engine is based on the 
so-called heterogeneous mixing of air with a fuel in 
which a fuel is injected into high-temperature and 
high-pressure air. In a heterogeneous gaseous 
mixture, air and fuel are not uniformly mixed unlike 
those in a homogeneous gaseous mixture. Therefore, 
the carbon components in a fuel turn into soot and HC 
due to the high-temperature combustion heat, and the 
soot and HC are coagulated and turned into 
particulates, which are discharged into and float in 
the atmospheric air to cause environmental pollution. An exhaust gas particulates removing apparatus 
for diesel engines in which two sets of filters of a 
porous honeycomb structure formed out of, for example,  
 
cordierite (2MgO·2Al2O3·5SiO2) are parallel-arranged in 
an exhaust passage has been disclosed as a 
conventional apparatus for treating an engine exhaust 
gas. This exhaust gas particulates removing apparatus 
for diesel engines is adapted to pass an exhaust gas 
through one filter of a honeycomb structure, collect 
carbon, which is contained in the exhaust gas, in the 
filter, interrupt the passing of the exhaust gas 
through the filter when the filter is clogged with the 
carbon collected therein and switch the direction of 
the flow of the exhaust gas so that it passes through 
the other filter, send the air to the clogged filter 
from the downstream side thereof, and heat the same 
filter so as to burn the carbon with which the filter 
is clogged. Such an exhaust gas particulates removing 
apparatus for diesel engines is disclosed in, for 
example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 144427/1989. Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 136617/1989 
discloses a particulate filter. This particulate 
filter comprises thin porous elements composed of a 
conductive ceramic material, serving also as heaters 
and arranged in a plurality of stages, and are formed 
so that electric power can be supplied to each porous 
element separately and controlled individually.  
 Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 116722/1991 
discloses an exhaust gas purifying apparatus for 
diesel engines. This exhaust gas purifying apparatus 
for diesel engines has a columnar ceramic filter in 
which a plurality of lengthwise extending cells are 
formed, and an electric heating member provided on the
