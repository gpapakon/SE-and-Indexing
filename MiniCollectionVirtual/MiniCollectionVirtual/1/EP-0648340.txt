<ABSTRACT>
A system for sensing objects in the flight path of an aircraft and alerting the pilot to their presence includes a laser radar subsystem for emitting a beam of laser energy, receiving returns from objects, and processing the returns to produce range data related to the range of the objects from the aircraft. A scanning subsystem scans the beam and produces directional information related to the instantaneous direction of the beam relative to the aircraft. Processor circuitry controls operation, processes the range data and directional information with instrumentation data from the avionics system, produces video information related to the range, direction, and type of the objects, and interfaces the video information to the video display system. The processor circuitry may be programmed to (1) overlay video information on existing aircraft video display system, (2) provide acoustical warnings on an aircraft intercom, (3) analyze returns by subdividing the field of regard into a series of analysis windows, performing a statistical analysis of the returns related to each of the analysis windows, and identifying returns that fall into a common range interval, (4) transforming coordinates of objects measured relative to the aircraft to a horizon-stabilized, north-oriented coordinate system which is independent of the attitude of the aircraft, (5) inserting the coordinates of identified objects into a data base so that the coordinates may be used for constructing a video display at a later time and updating the data base to correct for movements of the aircraft, and (6) constructing a window-of-safety display of objects currently within the field of regard by adjusting the displayed position of the objects to compensate for avoidance maneuvers the pilot may execute.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to avionic sensor systems. Many
aspects relate to an onboard system suitable for detecting obstacles and
alerting the pilot during low-altitude, night-time, helicopter operations.Low-altitude, night-time, helicopter operations provide great
advantages in many battlefield settings, but they also greatly increase the
risk of collision with wires, cables, towers, antennae, trees and terrain
features. To augment pilot vision, the helicopter commonly includes
imaging devices such as forward-looking infrared scanners (FLIRs) and
image intensifiers (night-vision goggles). However, resolution often
proves inadequate at normal flight speeds for timely detection of wires,
steel towers, and other thin objects. That limitation can significantly
impair operations and force reduced speed during transitional flight in
which the pilot flies to a target at altitudes below 50 feet and during nap-of-the-earth
flight in which the pilot flies as low as possible to avoid
detection. Daytime operations also have obstacle-related problems.
Thus, helicopter operations need a better way to detect obstacles.EP-A-0 391 328 discloses an obstacle detection and warning system
using a pulsed laser whose beam direction is determined by an acousto-optical
deflector. The radiation reflected by an obstacle is received by a
silicon avalanche sensor and processed to give a warning of obstacles and
their range. Some prior attempts at wire detection employ radio waves in the
millimetre wave band or light from carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers at 10.6
micrometers, Nd:Yag lasers at 1.06 micrometers, and various laser diodes
at 0.85 micrometer. But none have led to the development of a small,
compact, lightweight, cost effective obstacle avoidance system for
aircraft. Such a system should also feature eye-safe operation for
overflown personnel as well as aircraft ground crews, provide an effective
pilot interface, and install conveniently in existing aircraft. Furthermore,
it should operate at day or night and under inclement weather conditions,
and it should not impair aircraft survivability.This invention solves the problems and meets the criteria outlined
above by providing an onboard obstacle-detecting and pilot-warning
system referred to as an Obstacle Avoidance System (OASYS). It
combines a laser radar (ladar) subsystem with a scanning subsystem and
processor circuitry to produce a data bank of obstacle-related data. The
scanning subsystem combines circular and azimuthal scanning to cover a
field of regard (FOR)
