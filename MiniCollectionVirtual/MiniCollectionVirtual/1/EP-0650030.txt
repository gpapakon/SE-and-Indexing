<ABSTRACT>
According to an apparatus for and a method of evaluating a 
multilayer thin film of the present invention, an 

interference light beam in a predetermined wave number 
region is projected as a parallel beam onto a multilayer 

thin film sample (11) and the interference light beam 
reflected by the sample (11) is detected to fi
nd an 
interferogram. The interferogram is subjected to a Fourier 

transform, filtering and a reverse Fourier transform so 
that a spatialgram is provided. Thereby the variation of 

the incident angle of the light beam impinging on the 
sample and the incident surface is reduced, and the 

spatialgram can be provided with accurate information of 
the multilayer thin film. According to the apparatus and 

the method of the present invention, the reverse Fourier 
transform is performed by means of complex power reverse 

Fourier transform. As a result, compared with the case of 
performing cosine reverse Fourier transform, more 

information can be introduced in the same photometrical 
wave number range and a thin film measuring limit is 

improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
and a method of evaluating a multilayer thin film and more
particularly to an apparatus for and a method of evaluating
a multilayer thin film capable of evaluating the thickness
and the boundary state of each layer of the multilayer thin
film formed by epitaxial growth of a semiconductor crystal,
for example, in a non-destructive and non-contact manner.The article in OPTICS by Hecht et al., Addison-Wessley
Publishing, 1974, pages 564 - 565, discloses a spatial
filtering by which Fraunhofer interference patterns from
light diffracted at an edge are used to image an object.
The interference pattern is inverted by a lens and then
subjected to a reverse transform by a second lens. For
spatial filtering, an obstruction such as an optical filter
can be placed in a transform plane located between the
first and second lenses.In Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 11, No. 29 (P-540)
[2476] of January 28, 1997 (JP-A-61-200407) an apparatus is
disclosed for measuring film thickness. Infra-red light is
polarised before incidence on the specimen. Detection means
measure the reflected light at the Brewster angle.
Processing means determine a difference between the
vertically polarised and horizontally polarised light from
reflection, wherefrom information on the layer thickness is
obtained.Generally, an interference phenomenon of light is
used for measuring the thickness of a thin film in a non-destructive
and non-contact manner.For example, a sample having semiconductor thin
film layers 2, 3 and 4 formed on a semiconductor substrate 1
is shown in Fig. 1, on the surface of which a predetermined
light beam 5 impinges at an incident angle . Numerals 6,
7, 8 and 9 designate one-dimensional reflected light
components from the surfaces of the thin film layers 2, 3 and
4 and the substrate 1, respectively. The thicknesses and
refractive indices of the thin film layers 2, 3 and 4 are
designated as (d1,n1), (d2,n2) and (d3,n3) respectively and  
the refractive index of the substrate 1 is designated as ns.The reflected light components 6, 7, 8 and 9 from the
surfaces of the respective thin film layers 2, 3 and 4 and
the substrate 1 generate phase differences due to each
optical path length and are synthesized to interfere with
each other on the surface of the sample. When the i-th thin
film layer from the top is defined as the i-th layer (where
i is an integer), an optical path difference δi between the
reflected light component 6 from the surface of the top layer
and the
