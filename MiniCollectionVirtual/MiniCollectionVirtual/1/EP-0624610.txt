<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous dispersion containing   A) from 20 to 90% by weight of a dispersed polymer having a glass transition temperature of above 30@C and B) from 10 to 80% by weight of a tri-, tetra-, penta- or hexa(meth)acrylate of an alkoxylated, trihydric to hexahydric alcohol having a mean degree of alkoxylation of hydroxyl groups of the alcohol, defined as the quotient of the number of alkoxy groups and the number of hydroxyl groups, i.e. the functionality of the alcohol before alkoxylation, of at least 0.5, where the weight data are based on the sum of A) and B).

<CLAIMS>
The use of an aqueous dispersion containing

A) from 20 to 90% by weight of a dispersed polymer
having a glass transition temperature above 30°C

which comprises at least 40% by weight of main
monomers, selected from C
1
-C
20
-alkyl (meth)-acrylates,
vinyl esters of carboxylic acids of 1 to

20 carbon atoms, vinylaromatics of up to 20 carbon
atoms, ethylenically unsaturated nitriles of 3 to

6 carbon atoms, vinyl halides, aliphatic hydrocarbons
having 4 to 8 carbon atoms and at least 2

conjugated double bonds and aliphatic hydrocarbons
having 2-5 carbon atoms and one double bond, e.g.

ethylene, and mixtures of these monomers, and
B) from 10 to 80% by weight of a tri-, tetra-, penta-
or hexa(meth)acrylate of an alkoxylated, trivalent

to hexavalent alcohol having a mean degree of
alkoxylation of the hydroxyl groups of the alcohol,

defined as the quotient of the number of alkoxy
groups to the number of hydroxyl groups, ie. the

functionality of the alcohol prior to the
alkoxylation, of at least 0.5,

the stated weights being based on the sum of A) and B)
and polymers A) having an acid number above 80 being

excluded, for the production of radiation-curable
coatings.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein the trihexa(meth)acrylates
B) are those of the formula 



where A is an organic radical of 3 to 20 carbon atoms, R
1

is C
1
-C
6
-alkylene, R
2
 is hydrogen or methyl, n is an
integer from 0 to 20 and m is an integer from 3 to 6.
The use as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein not
more than 50 mol % of the double bonds in the (meth)
-acrylates
B) form a Michael adduct with primary or

secondary amines.
The use as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the glass transition temperature of the polymers

A) is above 60°C.
