<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and an
apparatus for activating carbon-containing material.In recent years, activated charcoal, due to its
properties as an adsorbent material with inert
characteristics, has been used increasingly in the most
disparate fields, such as for example:
-- in the processing of potable, process and waste
water, where activated charcoal effectively removes odors
and tastes as well as residues of colors and dissolved
organic substances;-- in the purification of air and gases, such as for
example in conditioning systems, in sewage systems, and in
chemical processes;-- in the preparation of filters for masks, hoods,
cigarettes, etc.;-- in the food industry, in processes for the
decolorization of sugar, glucose, vegetable oils, fermenting
alcoholic beverages, juices, etc.;-- in the pharmaceutical industry, to purify raw
materials and intermediate compounds;-- in the chemical industry, to purify colors and
plasticizers, organic acids, for galvanic deposition baths,
in recovering gold from residues of mining processes, in
catalysis, both as a medium (hydrogenation, desulfurization,
vinyl chloride synthesis) and as an actual catalyst
(phosgene, vinyl acetate, etc.);-- for use as a medicine, on its own or in association
with antiseptics, digestive ferments, etc., in the 
preparation of tablets or capsules.Its many uses, combined with the increasingly strict
limits set by new statutory provisions in the field of
pollution, have caused a considerable increase in the use of
activated charcoal. One should also add that processing with
activated charcoal is often cheaper than other purifying
systems, such as thermal or catalytic reheating, scrubbing,
or other adsorption techniques, when the level of the
impurities is less than a few hundred parts per million.Activated charcoal is obtained by activating carbon-based
material derived essentially from bituminous coals,
peat, coconut shells, wood, sawdust, etc. by means of
activation processes which are designated as chemical or
physical.Chemical activation uses the particular action of some
inorganic compounds (activating agents) during the
carbonization step, which is performed at temperatures of
400 to 600°C. The material is initially impregnated with
appropriate chemicals which, when heated, release oxidizing
gases that degrade the organic molecules. The main known
activating agents are zinc chloride and phosphoric acid;
positive results have been obtained by using sulfates or
phosphates of alkaline metals, potassium thiocyanide,
