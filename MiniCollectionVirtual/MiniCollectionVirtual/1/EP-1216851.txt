<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatic tire having an apex in the region of
the carcass ply turnup. More specifically, the invention relates to a pneumatic
tire having an apex comprised of a rubber containing the reaction product of a
partially polymerized cashew nutshell oil resin and a methylene donor.The term "apex" as used herein refers to the area of the tire in the
immediate proximity of the carcass ply turnup. The apex includes a rubber
wedge located in the lower sidewall region above the bead and is bonded to
and encased by the carcass plies. The apex also includes the area located
between the lower sidewall rubber and the axially outer side of the carcass ply
turnup.A tire is a composite of several components each serving a specific and
unique function yet all synergistically functioning to produce the desired
performance. One important component is the carcass ply. The carcass ply is
a continuous layer of rubber-coated parallel cords which extends from bead to
bead and functions as a reinforcing element of the tire. The plies are turned up
around the bead, thereby locking the bead into the assembly or carcass. The
tire is assembled in the green (uncured) state and upon completion is then
vulcanized. Conventional resorcinol-methylene donor systems are used in the
apex compounds. Unfortunately, resorcinol is a volatile material and is
therefore desirable to remove from the workplace. Therefore, there exists a
need for a resorcinol replacement without sacrificing the beneficial properties
resulting from its use.The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to
the accompanying drawing in which:
Figure 1 is a partial cross-sectional view of a tire according to the present
invention.The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire having an apex
comprised of a rubber containing 2.2 to 25 phr of the reaction product of a 
partially polymerized cashew nutshell oil resin and a methylene donor.There is disclosed a pneumatic tire having the apex around the carcass
ply turnup comprised of
(A) a sulfur-vulcanized rubber; and(B) from 2.2 to 25 phr of the reaction product of
(1) from 2 to 15 phr of a partially polymerized cashew nutshell oil
resin; and(2) from 0.02 to 15 phr of a methylene donor selected from the group
consisting of hexaethoxymethylmelamine, hexamethylenetetramine,
hexamethoxymethylmelamine, imino-methoxymethylmelamine,
imino-isobutoxymethylmelamine, lauryloxymethylpyridinium chloride,
ethoxymethylpyridinium chloride, trioxan hexamethoxymethylmelamine and
N-substituted
