<ABSTRACT>
A method for the estimation of a property or parameter of a nucleic acid material, or of a process in which a nucleic acid is modified by a chemical or biochemical reaction, the property or parameter being one to which the electrical conductivity of the nucleic acid material is related, comprises measuring the electrical conductivity of the nucleic acid material, or of a reaction mixturecontaining the material, and estimating from the measurement the property or parameter of the material or process by reference to a predetermined relationship between electrical conductivity and the property or parameter.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ESTIMATION OF NUCLEIC ACIDThis invention relates to the estimation of nucleic acid and more particularly to the estimation of a property or parameter of a nucleic acid or of a process in which a nucleic acid is modified by chemical or biochemical reaction. The invention is especially directed to the determination of concentration (quantification) of nucleic acids in solution and to the determination of molecular weight (sizing) of nucleic acid molecules. The invention is also applicable to the monitoring of reactions in which nucleic acids are modified chemically or biochemically.Conventionally, DNA concentra ion is determined spectrophotometrically, a method which relies on the characteristic absorption of ultra-violet light (ca. 260nm) by the nucleotide ring structure of DNA molecules. To determine molecular weight, DNA molecules are normally size-separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then visualised using the dye ethidium bromide. DNA can also be quantified in agarose gels by comparing with known standards by measuring the fluorescence emitted following excitation by ultra-violet light (ca. 300nm) . Both methods have inherent disadvantages. UV spectrophotometers are expensive pieces of equipment requiring the use of costly quartz curvettes and rely on the 'destructive' processing of relatively large sample volumes . The use of ethidium bromide for DNA visualisation and quantification, although a cheaper alternative, is also undesirable due to its extremely toxic and carcinogenic nature .The present invention comprises a method for the estimation of a property or parameter of a nucleic acid material, or of a process in which a nucleic acid is modified bv a chemical or biochemical reaction, said 

 property or parameter being one to which the electrical conductivity of the nucleic acid material is related, which method comprises measuring the electrical conductivity of the nucleic acid material, or of a reaction mixture containing said material, and estimating from said measurement the property or parameter of the material or process by reference to a predetermined relationship between electrical conductivity and said property or parameter.The present invention is based on the discovery that there are certain important properties of nucleic acids, the quantitative determination of which is frequently desirable, which can be assessed by measurement of the conductivity of a solution of the nucleic acid or acids. Changes in such properties may be reflected in corresponding changes of electrical
