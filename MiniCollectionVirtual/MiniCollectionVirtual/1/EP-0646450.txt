<ABSTRACT>
An extrusion apparatus for extruding 
thermoplastic material includes first (12) and second die (14) 

body portions that define a manifold (20) which has a 
back line (23) and is in fluid communication with an 

outlet through which the thermoplastic material is 
extruded and wherein the back line (23) is substantially 

parallel to the outlet (25). First and second body bolts 
join the first (12) and second (14) die body portions 

together. The first and second body bolts are 
disposed at first and second equal distances, 

respectively, from the back line (23) and are further 
disposed on opposite sides of a centerline (33) of the 

extrusion apparatus at third and fourth unequal 
distances therefrom, respectively, and are 

substantially equally spaced from the outlet (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
extrusion apparatus and more particularly to an
extrusion die for coextruding thermoplastic
materials to produce a sheet of substantially
uniform thickness.An extrusion die is used to extrude molten
thermoplastic into a film or sheet. A prior type of
extrusion die includes a die cavity having a
coathanger-shaped manifold at an upstream portion of
the die, a triangular preland portion downstream of
the manifold, a melt well (otherwise referred to as
a secondary relief or secondary manifold) downstream
of the preland portion and a die exit adjacent the
melt well. In this type of die, a back line (or
upstream edge) of the preland portion includes
linear edges forming a taper which converges toward
a die entrance. The preland portion provides
resistance to flow which varies over the width of
the die so that the flow of thermoplastic is
uniformly transversely spread out.It has been found that, owing to the
rheological characteristics of thermoplastics, the
use of a preland portion having a linearly tapered
upstream or downstream edge results in less than
ideal thermoplastic flow through the die. In 
particular, in the case where a monolayer flow is
passed through the die, the extrudate tends to flow
in a fashion which produces an M-shaped or W-shaped
flow distribution profile. In the past, this
problem was obviated for a given extruder flow rate
by adjusting the lip gap at the die exit so that the
flow nonuniformity was corrected. Because extruder
flow rates in the past were typically maintained
substantially constant from job to job, this
adjustment did not have to be frequently repeated in
order to maintain high quality output. However,
more recent attempts at reducing costs by reducing
inventories have led to the need to produce short
runs of product, thereby necessitating the use of
differing extruder flow rates. This undesirably
creates the need to frequently readjust the lip gap
at the die exit.In the case where two or more
thermoplastic flows are to be coextruded in separate
layers, the use of a conventional die as described
above results in the production of a layer boundary
(or layer boundaries) having an M or W shape. Such
an interface deformation (or encapsulation) results
not only from the linear preland configuration but
also from the manifold design. This deformation
cannot be eliminated by adjusting the die lip gap.
In addition to the foregoing effect, the overall
film will have the M or W shape noted above in
connection with monolayer
