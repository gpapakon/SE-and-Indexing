<ABSTRACT>
A balloon weight (10) for counterbalancing the 
lift of helium fitted balloons and the like. The 

balloon weight (10) has a molded plastic body (12) of 
aesthetically pleasing appearance, with a clip or latch 

assembly (18) at the top thereof. The latch assembly 
includes a pair of separated lobes (30, 32) which are 

adapted to be engaged within the aperture (40) of a 
latch plate (22) which is folded about a hinge and laid 

thereover. A receptacle (36) is defined between the 
lobes for receiving a balloon ribbon or string (52) 

which is then clinched between the side edges of the 
aperture and a base member (26) upon which the aperture 

closes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention herein resides in the art of ballast items. More particularly, 
the invention relates to balloon weights of the type employed for counterbalancing 
helium filled "Mylar" or foil balloons. Specifically, the invention relates to balloon 
weights having a clasp as an integral portion thereof, which clasp is quickly and 
easily employed to engage a ribbon or string of the balloon to provide secured 
engagement therewith. Balloons are in common usage for many purposes. Balloons are 
commonplace at parties, in sick rooms, as a form of greeting, or simply as a 
novelty item. Balloon bouquets are commonplace, as is the simple securement 
of a balloon to a stick, string, ribbon or the like. Presently, helium filled balloons 
are extremely popular because they remain constantly elevated at the end of a 
string or ribbon. Indeed, "Mylar" or foil balloons are now commonly used for 
such purposes because of their attractive nature and ability to seal against leakage 
of the helium gas contained therein. Typically, helium filled balloons are maintained at one end of a string or 
ribbon which is held at the other by an individual such as a child. If the 
individual releases the string or ribbon, the balloon quickly escapes retrieval by 
ascending into the atmosphere. Whether the balloon is of the latex or "Mylar" 
type, such escape results in a loss of the balloon and a hazard to the environment, 
since neither are biodegradable. Additionally, "Mylar" and foil balloons are 
electrically conductive and, if they come into contact with electrical wires or the 
like, can cause electrical shorts, sparking, arcing, and the like. For this reason, 
some governmental agencies have imposed regulations which require that "Mylar" 
or foil balloons have a counterbalance weight at the end of the associated ribbon 
such that the balloon will not escape to the atmosphere in the event that the 
ribbon is released by the individual holding it. Such weight provides a  
 
counterbalance or ballast to the balloon which is sufficient to defeat the "lift" of 
the helium envelope defined by the "Mylar" or foil balloon. Accordingly, if the 
ribbon is released, the weight simply drops to the ground and remains there since 
the gravitational force upon the weight is greater than the lift of the helium 
envelope. Retrieval is then a simple matter. Presently, the provision of balloon weights to prevent escapement of 
helium filled balloons is well known. Such balloon weights simply attached to the 
end of the string or ribbon of the

<CLAIMS>
A balloon weight, comprising: 
   a body portion; and 

   a latch assembly extending from an edge of said body portion, said latch 
assembly being adapted to securedly engage a ribbon. 
The balloon weight according to claim 1, wherein said latch assembly 
comprises a base plate, a latch plate, and a hinge interconnecting said base and 

latch plate. 
The balloon weight according to claim 2, wherein said base plate has a pair 
of deflectable lugs thereon and said latch plate has a window therein, said window 

securedly receiving said lugs when said latch plate is folded onto said base plate 
about said hinge. 
The balloon weight according to claim 3, wherein said deflectable lugs 
extend from opposite ends of a bar interconnected with said base plate. 
The balloon weight according to claim 4, wherein said bar is received by 
a base member, said bar having a lesser width than said base member. 
The balloon weight according to claim 5, wherein said bar defines a 
receptacle between said lugs for receiving said ribbon. 
The balloon weight according to claim 6, wherein said window has first and 
second tapered surfacesdisposed at opposite ends thereof. 
The balloon weight according to claim 7, wherein said tapered surfaces 
taper at different angles. 
The balloon weight according to claim 6, wherein said latch plate is 
maintained between said base plate and said lugs when said latch plate is folded 

onto said base plate about said hinge. 
The balloon weight according to claim 9, wherein said window is 
substantially congruent with said base member and receives said base member 

when said latch plate is folded onto said base plate about said hinge, and wherein 
said ribbon is thereby clinched in said receptacle. 
A weight for securing the end of a ribbon attached to a balloon, 
comprising: 

   a base plate having deflectable lugs extending therefrom; 
   a latch plate having an aperture therein for receiving said lugs; and 

   a hinge interconnecting said base and latch plates, said lugs being received 
by said aperture when said latch plate is folded into said base plate about said 

hinge. 
The weight according to claim 11, wherein said lugs are positioned at 
opposite ends of a bar, said Jugs and said bar defining a receptacle for the ribbon. 
The weight according to claim 12, wherein said lugs have radiused outer 
surfaces. 
The weight according to claim 13, wherein oppositely disposed edges of 
said aperture engage said radiused outer surfaces of said lugs and deflect said lugs 

when said latch plate is folded onto said base plate about said hinge.
