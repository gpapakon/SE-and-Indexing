<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit including
an MOS transistor and, more particularly, to control of
the drain-source breakdown voltage of an MOS transistor.US-A-5 086 365 describes an electrostatic discharge
protection circuit comprising an MOS transistor with an open back gate in which a parasitic bipolar
transistor switches on to divert negative electrostatic
discharge pulses to ground.It is generally known that as the collector-emitter
voltage is applied to a bipolar transistor having an open
base, avalanche breakdown occurs at a certain voltage,
causing a large current to flow between the collector and
emitter. This is because the dark current between the
collector and emitter causes an electron avalanche in the
base area. This is described, for example, on pages 231-233
in "Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices"
(John Wiley and Sons, Inc. 1976) by A.S. Grove.Although the aforementioned mechanism for causing
avalanche breakdown is known, the avalanche breakdown
voltage depends on the manufacturing process of
semiconductor devices, such as the impurity concentration 
of the base, and cannot be changed once the device
manufacturing process is determined.Accordingly, it is an object of the present
invention to provide a transistor circuit which can
electrically control the avalanche breakdown voltage even
after the manufacturing process of semi-conductor devices
is determined.A transistor circuit according to this invention 
comprises a MOS transistor with an open back gate, and
control means for controlling a voltage to be applied to
the control gate of the MOS transistor, whereby the
control means controls the avalanche breakdown voltage
of a parasitic bipolar transistor formed by the drain,
back gate and source of the MOS transistor.The present inventors discovered that the avalanche
breakdown voltage of a parasitic bipolar transistor
formed by the source, back gate (substrate) and drain of
a MOS transistor is controllable by changing the gate
voltage of this MOS transistor, and the present
invention has been devised in view of this discovery.
If the avalanche breakdown voltage is controllable, it
is possible to prevent the avalanche breakdown of the
parasitic bipolar transistor of the MOS transistor from
occurring, permit the avalanche breakdown to occur at an
early stage, or delay the occurrence of the avalanche
breakdown as much as possible. This invention can
therefore accomplish a promising transistor circuit
which can be used in a variety of applications and is
very
