<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger (10) for an automotive vehicle 
includes a pair of manifolds (12, 14) each including a 

header portion (24) and a tank portion (26). The tank 
portion (26) includes a predetermined number of generally 

horizontal rib portions (30) formed therein at predetermined 
positions. The heat exchanger (10) further includes a 

plurality of tubular elements (16) disposed in spaced, 
substantially parallel relation and which define flow paths 

for the coolant between the manifolds (12, 14). At least 
one of the tubular elements (32) has a length greater than 

an adjacent tubular element (16) and extends through the 
header portion into mating engagement with the rib portion 

(30) of the tank (26) of one of the manifolds to form baffle 
means (36) for preventing the flow of coolant therepast.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a parallel 
flow heat exchanger for an automotive vehicle. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a parallel 
flow condenser having a baffle assembly formed integrally 
with the tubular elements of the condenser. Automotive condensers typically have been constructed 
with a single length of refrigerant tube assembled in a 
serpentine configuration with an inlet at one end and an 
outlet at another end. Fin members are interposed between 
the parallel portions formed between the bends of the tube. 
The serpentine type of heat exchanger has been successfully 
used for many years but has limited efficiency improvement. 
For example, because the extruded tube is bent into a 
serpentine shape, it is impossible to make the radius of 
curvature of the bend smaller than a certain limit so that 
the pitch of the tubes cannot be made small, limiting the 
number of fin members that can be placed between the 
parallel portions of the tube, and thus the heat transfer 
efficiency of the condenser cannot be maximized. Because of these deficiencies, multi-flow or parallel-flow 
type of heat exchangers have been appearing as 
replacements for the serpentine type of heat exchangers. In 
the parallel flow heat exchanger, numerous flat, extruded 
tube and fin members are alternately placed next to each 
other with both ends of the tube connected to hollow 
manifold assemblies. In order to accomplish multiple pass 
flow within the heat exchanger, one or more baffles are 
located in the manifold assemblies between its ends. Various baffle designs have been proposed to provide 
for the multiple path flow of the heat exchange medium. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,960,169 discloses a baffle formed 
as a collar surrounding a tubular member and extending 
through the manifold assembly. In this design, the baffle 
is formed as a separate piece from the tubular member and 
connected thereto. In such a construction, the connection 
portion may result in leakage. The cost increase to the 
condenser is high due to the added complexity of this  
 
design. It would, therefore, be advantageous to provide a 
parallel flow or multi-flow condenser wherein the baffle 
assembly is formed integrally with one of the tubular 
members to overcome the limitations of the prior art. The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of 
the prior art by providing a condenser for liquefying 
gaseous coolant in an air conditioning system of an 
automobile after the system has compressed the

<CLAIMS>
A condenser for liquefying gaseous coolant in an 
air conditioning system of an automobile after the system 

has compressed the coolant, said condenser comprising: 
   a pair of manifolds (12,14) each having a longitudinal 

axis and disposed in spaced, substantially parallel 
relationship at opposite ends of said condenser and defining 

a coolant inlet (20) and coolant outlet (22) for said 
condenser, each of said manifolds (12,14) including a tank 

portion (26) and a header portion (24) having a plurality of 
tube receiving slots (28) disposed in substantially parallel 

relationship;

element and having one end shaped substantially similarly to 
the inside of said tank portion (26) and which extends 

through said header portion (24) into engagement with said 
tank portion (26) of one of said manifolds to form baffle 

means (36) for preventing the flow of coolant therepast in a 
direction generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of 

said manifold; and

portion of each of said pair of manifolds each includes a 

plurality of generally horizontal rib portions formed 
therein at predetermined positions along the longitudinal 

axis thereof, said rib portions being configured to matingly 
receive said one end of said tubular elements of greater 

length therein. 
A condenser according to Claim 1, wherein one 
manifold defines the coolant inlet and outlet. 
A condenser according to Claim 1, wherein said at 
least one tubular element includes a notch formed on one 

side thereof substantially across the width of said tubular 
element for allowing coolant to enter said tubular element 

and flow in a direction generally transverse to the 
longitudinal axis of said manifold to said other manifold. 
A condenser according to Claim 1, wherein said at 
least one tubular element includes a generally arcuate-shaped 

end which engages said rib portion. 
A condenser according to Claim 1, wherein said 
condenser includes three tubular elements of the greater 

length to define four coolant flow paths through said 
condenser. 
A condenser according to Claim 6, wherein two of 
said tubular elements of greater length engage said rib 

portions of one header portion and one tubular element of 
greater length engages the rib portions of said other header 

portion. 
A condenser according to Claim 1, wherein said

A condenser according to Claim 1, wherein each of 
said header and tank portions of each manifold is a separate 

unitary piece matingly engageable with each other at 
predetermined locations.
