<ABSTRACT>
Fragments of HIV p17 protein ranging in length from about 

12 to about 40 amino acids are used to form diagnostics and 
vaccines for detection or treatment of AIDS. Specific peptide 

fragments extend from the N-terminal to the C-terminal. Peptides 
having the amino acid sequences shown by the following formula 

(I), (II), (III), (IV) and (V): 

are immunoreactive to antibodies in sera of patients testing 
seropositive for p17 of HIV-1.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to peptide fragments derived from 
p17 gag protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which is 
the causative organism of the diseases known as Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or pre-AIDS (also known as AIDS-Related 
Complex or ARC) . These peptide fragments can be used 
directly as diagnostic reagents for detecting the presence in the 
blood of the HIV retrovirus, or for detecting antibodies to HIV 
retroviral proteins or for raising antibodies which recognize the 
p17 gag protein of HIV or its fragments. The invention also 
relates to fragments or analogues of the p17 gag protein peptides 
which possess the immunogenic epitopes of the "parent" peptides. 
In a further aspect, the invention relates to the use of these 
p17 peptide fragments and analogues which are capable of 
eliciting protective antibodies as a component of an AIDS vaccine 
and to the resulting AIDS vaccine compositions. There has been extensive amounts of research over the 
past several years, first to identify the cause of the disease 
AIDS and after the positive identification of the retroviruses 
HTLV-III, ARV and others, now generically referred to as HIV, as 
the causative organism, efforts have concentrated on more 
detailed analysis of the genetic makeup, molecular biology, 
infection mechanism, biochemistry, high sensitivity methods of 
detection and treatments, therapies and cures. Extensive 
progress has been made in all of these areas yet much more work  
 
needs to be done to effectively combat the spread of AIDS. An 
essential part of the approach for combatting the spread of the 
highly infectious HIV virus is the development of highly 
sensitive tests for diagnosing the presence in the blood of the 
HIV virus or antibodies to the HIV virus. Early detection may 
facilitate therapies for combatting or slowing down the 
progression of the course of HIV infection leading to the 
development of full-blown or frank AIDS. Knowledge of infection 
with HIV by accurate diagnosis may encourage infected patients 
to alter or modify their lifestyles in such manner as to reduce 
the risk of spreading the virus. Additionally, identification 
of protective antibodies based on epitope recognition can offer a 
more effective mechanism for staging and/or diagnosing the AIDS 
or pre-AIDS/ disease. Such staging and early diagnosis of 
seropositive individuals may then allow for vaccinations to 
provide the appropriate protective antibodies for treating the 
seropositive individual. Recently, U.S. Patent
