<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to elastic articles and a method for their 
production. More particularly this invention relates to ethylene-based plastomer 
articles having improved unload power and a process for their production. Even 
more particularly this invention relates to a plastomer precursor which, by a post 
polymerization process of orienting and annealing, is made into an article having 
improved unload power. Elastomeric polymers are utilized in a wide variety of applications for which 
non-elastic polymers are totally unsuited. For example, in articles of clothing, such 
elastomeric polymers are utilized as neck, wrist, waist, ankle and head bands. As 
the garment is worn, the elastic polymer band must have enough "unload power" to 
hold it in place. When the garment is not worn, it is generally desirable that the 
elastic polymer band have a low "residual set" so that the elastic polymer band of 
the garment returns essentially to its original shape. In addition, the elastic 
polymer band must also demonstrate a high degree of repeatability as the garment 
is worn over a long period of time. In terms of garment applications, these 
constraints dictate which of those elastomeric polymer compositions now known 
can be fabricated into article forms which can be placed into applications in 
garments. "Unload power" is an important elastic tensile property in elastics 
applications, particularly for garment applications. For example, in diaper 
applications, the unload power of an elastomeric article provides an indication of 
the retractive force which holds the elastomeric article which is part of the diaper 
leg of the garment against the infant's body. In all elastomeric materials, the unload 
power is lower than the load power (the force required to extend the strip). This 
difference shows up as a hysteresis (i.e. the force to extend is different than the 
force to hold in place) and is larger for synthetic elastomers than in the case of a  
 
natural rubber. "Residual set" refers to the change between the length of an 
elastomeric material before and after its extension to a certain length for a certain 
time for a certain number of cycles. Residual set may be for example, the percent 
change in length of a film after extension of the film to 200 percent of its initial 
length through 5 cycles. Each cycle would consist of extending the film to 200 
percent of its initial length, holding the film extended for a time period, releasing 
the extending force, and allowing the film to return
