<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for fixing a tube (11) in a sleeve (15). The tube end is inserted into the sleeve (15) and fixed in the latter at least in the axial direction. In order to ensure easy and rapid assembly and also secure fixing of the tube (11) in the sleeve (15), provision is made for the tube (11) to have in its end region at least one bent-out piece (12) which projects radially outwards and is directed opposite the direction of insertion and which enters into engagement with a recess (16) in the inner wall of the sleeve (15). The recess (16) can be formed by a groove (16) running all the way round on the inner surface of the sleeve (15) substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis, so that the sleeve (15) is rotatable relative to the tube (11).

Device for fixing a sleeve-like cap (15) to the upper end of a tubular
handle (11) of a working or cleaning implement, particularly a broom,

scrubber, extractor, etc., the handle end being insertable into the cap
and is fixable therein at least in the axial direction, characterized in

that in its end region, the handle (11) has at least one radially outwardly
projecting latch, which is formed by a bulge (12) of the wall of the

tubular handle (11) oriented counter to the insertion direction (E) and
which can be engaged with a recess (16) formed in the inner wall of the

cap (15).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the recess is a
circumferential groove (16) substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal

axis of the handle (11), so that the cap (15) can rotate relative to the
handle (11).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that there are
several, preferably four bulges (12) uniformly distributed in the circumferential

direction of the handle (11).
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that a
stop (17) limiting the axial insertion movement is formed in the sleeve-like

cap (15).
Device according to claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the bulges (12)
are provided in different cross-sectional planes of the handle (11).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that there are several
axially spaced grooves (16).
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the
cap (15) and/or bulge (12) is elastically deformable.
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 7, characterized in that
the bulges (12) are provided on their free engagement end with a serrated

profiling (12a, 12b). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the
tubular handle (11) is made from metal.
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 9, characterized in that
the cap (15) is provided with a hanging dev
ice (18) for the handle (11).
