portion provided on the other of the two 

objects, and a light-receiving portion provided on the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotation
detecting apparatus for measuring a rotation speed, a
rotational displacement and so on of a rotating object
and a scale for rotation detection.There are conventional apparatus utilized for
obtaining a physical amount such as a rotation angle or
an angular velocity of an object at high accuracy while
irradiating light onto the object, for example optical
rotary encoders. These apparatus utilizing light are
featured by their high accuracy and high resolution,
but are desired to have a smaller size (i.e., a size on
the millimeter order), a higher accuracy, a higher
resolution (of 0.1 µm order), and higher stability in
order to be applied in wider fields. A millimeter size
apparatus could be used as directly bonded to a
measured object, and therefore can be used for smaller
apparatus.Fig. 1A is a perspective view to show an
example of a conventional optical rotary encoder as
described for example in Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application No. 5-157583. In Fig. 1A, reference
numeral 101 denotes a light source such as a 
semiconductor laser, 102 a lens, 103 a beam splitter,
104 a rotary disk plate on which a diffraction grating
105 is formed radially on a rotational trace of a
position where a beam passing through the beam splitter
103 is incident at right angles and at constant
intervals, 106 a condenser lens for condensing beams
reflected by the diffraction grating 105 and then also
reflected by the beam splitter 103, 107 a beam splitter
for reflecting the beams from the condenser lens 106 to
make the beams incident at right angles onto the
diffraction grating 105 on the rotary disk plate 104,
108 a mirror for reflecting beams reflected by the
diffraction grating 105 and then passing through the
beam splitter 107, and 109 a beam splitter for guiding
the beams reflected by the mirror 108 to a light-receiving
element 110.The conventional optical rotary encoders have
been utilizing a disk plate 6a on which radial gratings
are formed as shown in Fig. 1B as light phase
modulating means used as a scale. Since such a rotary
encoder of the above structure is so arranged that the
diffraction grating as the light phase modulating means
is radially formed on the disk plate, the grating pitch
differs in the radial direction. This pitch change
could be a cause of measurement error. Then an
arrangement is necessary for precisely setting a
grating reading position of a reading head in the 
radial direction or for correcting a change in the
position when caused. It was thus
