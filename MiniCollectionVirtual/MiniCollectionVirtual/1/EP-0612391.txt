<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fittings for attachment
to a tube by swaging according to the preambles of claims
1, 21, 22.A fitting of the afore-mentioned kind has been known
from US-A-4 482 174.Fittings are commonly used to connect metal tubes
and pipes to each other for use in a variety of applications,
such as in the aerospace industry, to convey fuel, hydraulic
control fluids and the like in an aircraft or space vehicle.
In these applications, it is critical that there be a secure
connection between the fitting and the tubes in order to
withstand vibration and other adverse conditions without failure.Various fittings have been developed in the past to
connect tubes to each other. In one type of fitting, a radial
swaging force is applied to the fitting and the tube, which
may be done externally around the fitting or internally within
the tube. In either case, the radial swaging force is applied
directly to the fitting and tube by the tool. In some instances,
the inner surface of the fitting has a plurality of axially
spaced annular grooves into which the material of the tube is
deformed by the swaging tool to make the swaged connection.
In other instances, a curved or irregular configuration on the
outer surface of the fitting is transferred to the inner surface
of the fitting upon swaging, which causes the tube to deflect
and conform to the irregular configuration and thereby make
the connection.Another type of fitting comprises a cylindrical
sleeve having a tapered outer surface and a cylindrical
inner surface for receiving a tube. A deforming ring surrounds
the sleeve and has a tapered inner surface which
matches and engages with the tapered outer surface of the 
sleeve. Before swaging, the deforming ring is positioned
outwardly with respect to the sleeve such that no radial
force is applied by the deforming ring to the sleeve.
During swaging, the deforming ring is moved axially in a
forward direction over the sleeve such that the
interaction of the tapered surfaces on the ring and the
sleeve applies a radial force deforming the sleeve and the
tube inwardly to make a swaged connection between them.
These fittings shall be generally referred to as axially
swaged fittings.In the aircraft industry and in the marine and
commercial fields, it is desirable to have the weight of
the hydraulic plumbing installation as low as possible.
All of the fittings described above pose a problem in this
regard, since many hundreds of them are used in an
aircraft, thus making their total weight contribution a
notic
