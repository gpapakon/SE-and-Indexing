<ABSTRACT>
In order to locate saturated pixel values in the display of a 
digital image representation that was subjected to a signal-to-density 

transformation the pixel values of the digital image 
representation are subjected to a second signal-to-density 

transformation that is substantially equal to the first 
transformation with the exception of at least one discontinuity 

situated in (a) saturated pixel value(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of digital radiography. 
The invention more specifically relates to a method and an apparatus 
for displaying a radiographic image and for locating saturated 
pixels in the displayed image. In the field of digital radiography a wide variety of image 
acquisition techniques have been developed such as computerised 
tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultrasound, detection of a 
radiation image by means of a CCD sensor or a video camera, 
radiographic film scanning etc. By means of these techniques a 
digital representation of a radiographic image is obtained. In still another technique a radiation image, for example an 
image of x-rays transmitted by an object, is stored in a screen 
comprising a photostimulable phosphor such as one of the phosphors 
described in EP-A-503 702 published on 
16.09.92. The technique for reading out the 
stored radiation image consists of scanning the screen with 
stimulating radiation, such as laser light of the appropriate 
wavelength, detecting the light emitted upon stimulation and 
converting the emitted light into an electric representation for 
example by means of a photomultiplier and finally digitizing the 
signal. The digital images obtained by one of the acquisition techniques 
described hereinbefore can be subjected to a wide variety of image 
processing techniques. If the unprocessed original image representation is stored, it 
can be subjected off-line to different types of image processing 
techniques as well as to processing using different values of the 
processing parameters as frequently as required. The processed or unprocessed images can further be applied to a 
display device and/or can be reproduced by means of an image 
recorder such as a laser recorder or the like.  
 For the purpose of display and/or hard copy recording signal 
values are converted into density values envisioned in the display 
or hard copy according to a signal-to-density mapping curve that has 
a predetermined shape in between a minimum and a maximum displayable 
or reproducible density value. Prior to display or hard copy recording the image is commonly 
subjected to a window/levelling operation. A subrange within the 
entire range of acquired signal values is defined. Within this 
range signal values are mapped to density values between said 
minimum and maximum density values and outside this range signal 
values are mapped onto the minimum density value if they are smaller 
than the minimum value of said subrange and onto the maximum

image that are saturated when digital pixel values of said image are 

transformed into density values in accordance with a first signal-to-density
