<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a water-based preparation to be mixed with blood, containing citrate ions which inhibit coagulation, as well as a method applied at collection of blood from a living organism while adding an anticoagulant substance including citrate ions. The new features of the invention are that acetate, being a physiologic energy source, inter alia for platelets, is included in the preparation and is added to the blood during collection in addition to the anticoagulant substance in order to obtain prolonged shelf-life of the platelet concentrate without increased risk for the donor or patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
Platelet transfusion is an often life-saving form
of patient treatment, since platelets are required for
normal hemostasis, i.e. for bleedings from wounds to stop
normally; on the other hand, platelets may appear in too
small numbers due to certain diseases and/or treatments.
Blood donors may be the source of platelet concentrates
for transfusion in two principally different ways, one
being conventional whole blood donation and the other
being so called platelet apheresis by means of a blood
cell separator.With the objective to make the best possible use of
the unique raw material, in modern transfusion medicine
it is the routine worldwide that whole blood is separated
into its main components, usually according to one of the
systems first described by Professor Claes HÃ¶gman, M.D.,
Uppsala, Sweden. In these procedures platelets may be
recovered either from the platelet rich plasma resulting
from a first step of centrifugation, carried out at
relatively few revolutions per minute, or from the so
called buffy coat, which constitutes the top layer of
blood particles after normal, harder centrifugation of
the primary blood bag, in which case the supernatant
plasma turns out to be virtually platelet-free.Especially in Italy and in Sweden, a new important
routine method has rapidly been established in order to
satisfy the extremely great need for platelets in some
hospitals, viz, so called pooling of 4-6 buffy coat
preparations, including a small amount of accompanying
erythrocytes and also a small volume of plasma, with the
ensuing dilution with 250-300 ml of either standard
saline solution or of a more complex solution containing 
carbohydrates and saline, followed by a final step of
centrifugation low rotary speed for the elimination of
erythrocytes and leukocytes from the platelet preparation.Platelet apheresis is a procedure within transfusion
medicine/blood banking, which has been well
established for 10-15 years and which by use of a blood
cell separator makes it possible for one single donor in
60 to 90 minutes to put a full transfusion dosis of
hemostatically active platelets to the disposition of a
patient in need. This method of procurement has several
advantages for the patient as compared with preparing a
so to say pooled platelet concentrate from 4-8 whole
blood units from conventional blood donation. Carried out
professionally by means of blood cell separators of
various kinds, platelet apheresis and similar, more
frequently occurring plasmapheresis as plasma donation,
are completely safe

<CLAIMS>
Method in collecting blood from a living
organism for recovering trombocytes, an anti-coagulant

substance being added to the blood, said substance due to
contents of citrate ions being able to complex bind calcium

ions and thus to inhibit coagulation of blood and
activation of trombocytes, said substance being suitable

for mixing with blood to be separated into at least two
components one of which is a trombocyte concentrate, and

being suitable also for supply to the organism with blood
or a blood fraction returned to said organism, without

side-effects, 
characterized
 in that before the separation
acetate is added to the blood together with the anti-coagulant

substance as a physiological atoxic energy
source, i.a. for trombocytes, in order to obtain prolonged

viability of the trombocyte concentrate during storage
thereof without increased risk for the donor/patient. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in
that said anti-coagulant substance is the citrate-based

anti-coagulant solution ACD-A.
