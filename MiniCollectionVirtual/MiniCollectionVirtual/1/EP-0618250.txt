<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a lactic acid-based 
copolyester by the ring-opening copolymerization and 

transesterification of a lactide (A) with an aromatic 
polyester (B) and/or an aliphatic polyester (C) in the 

presence of a ring-opening polymerization catalyst (D), and a 
packaging material comprising the lactic acid-based 

copolyester obtained by the process are disclosed. According 
to the present invention, a lactic acid-based degradable 

copolyester which has a sufficiently high molecular weight 
and satisfactory toughness and also has suitable rigidity, 

pliability, and transparency according to applications can be 
produced. Further, a general-purpose packaging material, 

e.g., a sheet or film, which comprises the lactic acid-based 
copolyester produced by the process and is excellent in 

formability, degradability, and transparency can also be 
produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a lactic acid-based copolyester by the ring-opening
addition polymerization and transesterification of a lactide
with an aromatic polyester, aliphatic polyester, and
aromatic/aliphatic polyester, and to a packaging material
comprising the lactic acid-based copolyester obtained by the
process.The lactic acid-based copolyester obtained by the
present invention can be molded by various techniques, such
as extrusion molding, injection molding, inflation molding,
laminating, and press molding, using existing devices for use
with general-purpose resins. It is useful as a wide variety
of packaging materials.For example, the copolyester is useful in film
applications including bags such as garbage bags, bags
supplied by stores on purchase, general-purpose standard
bags, and heavy-duty bags, packaging materials for, e.g.,
agricultural use, foods, industrial use, fibers, and other
miscellaneous goods, binding tapes, and agricultural
multipurpose films, and is also useful as sheets and
injection-molded articles including not only agricultural or
industrial sheets and sheets for foods but also trays, 
miscellaneous goods for daily use, food containers, sheets
for curing, seedling pots, and industrial materials and
parts.In recent years, extensive investigations have been
made on the practical use of lactic acid polymers having
excellent biodegradability as general-purpose polymers in a
wide range of fields from the standpoints of alleviating
environmental problems and others, and a large number of
investigations and patent applications have been made
concerning production processes therefor. However, the
conventional polymers of lactic acid or lactide, i.e.,
poly(lactic acid) and copolymers of lactide and other
monomer(s), have insufficient performance with respect to
moldability and transparency. In addition, poly(lactic acid)
has other problems, for example, that it degrades too quickly
in applications other than special ones, so that it is
unsuited for use as a general-purpose resin. There has hence
been a desire for the development of a novel biodegradable
polymer.In International Publication No. 91/02015 are
described a copolymer of an aromatic polyester, such as
poly(ethylene terephthalate) or poly(butylene terephthalate),
with either polyglycolide or poly(lactic acid) and processes
for producing the copolymer. The processes described are one based on the reaction
of monomers in which lactide is reacted with butylene glycol
and dimethyl terephthalate
