<DESCRIPTION>
Floor surface covering materials, such as carpets, 
and more particularly carpet tiles, typically comprise 
a traffic-bearing or wear face surface on a primary 
backing, such as a fibrous face surface, which has been 
woven, needle-punctured, fusion-bonded or otherwise 
secured to a primary backing layer or sheet, and a back 
surface to which is bonded one or more layers of solid 
or foam backing material. A solid backing material 
typically comprises a polyvinyl chloride backing material 
or a bitumen or atactic polypropylene backing layer, 
which are thermoplastic-type materials and which require 
different techniques in the coating process due the 
nature of the backing materials. Foam backing layers 
usually comprise a soft, resilient foam material, such 
as a polyvinyl chloride foam, a urethane foam or an 
elastomer latex-type foam, such as a 
styrene-butadiene-styrene rubber foam, to provide a 
resilient cushioning effect, and which foam is secured 
by an adhesive layer to the backing layer cr directly 
to the back surface of the primary backing layer. The 
foam backing layer is selected to be resilient, i.e. 
elastomeric in properties, and to have a high compression 
strength and a low compression set, that is, the foam 
will upon compression rebound quickly or retain its 
original dimensions after repeated or prolonged use 
so as not to deform the face of the carpet, such as 
for example where chair or table legs are placed on 
the face surface of the carpet for short or extended 
time periods. Such floor surface coverings may also 
optionally have embossed back surfaces or have secondary 
backing layers, such as polyester or polypropylene layers, 
applied to the back surface of the floor surface material.  
 
The covering also may include for example continuous or 
discontinuous, pressure-sensitive adhesive material with or 
without a release sheet for securing the surface covering to 
the substrate to which it is going to be applied. It is desirable to provide for a new and improved 
foam-containing floor surface covering material and method 
of preparation which employs foam material in the backing 
layer and to provide a lightweight, resilient, cushioned 
floor surface covering material, particularly a foam-containing, 
backed carpet tile. According to one aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a floor covering which comprises: 
a) a primary backing layer having a fibrous face wear 
surface and a back surface; b) a first solid thermoplastic backing layer; c) a second solid

<CLAIMS>
A floor covering which comprises: 

a) a primary backing layer (12) having a fibrous 
face wear surface (14) and a back surface; 
b) a first solid thermoplastic backing layer (18) bonded to said back surface; 
c) a second solid thermoplastic backing layer (24); 
and 
d) a non-elastomeric, low density polymeric foam layer (22) having a 
high compression set and a low compression strength, the foam layer being positioned and 

secured between the first and second thermoplastic backing 
layers (18,24), the first and second thermoplastic backing 

layers ranging in thickness from about 0.5mm to 4mm to 
disperse the mechanical force on the foam layer (22) and to 

protect the polymeric foam layer (22) from substantial 
cellular breakdown in use, and the polymeric foam layer 

having a thickness of from about 2 mm to 16 mm to provide a 
lightweight, cushioning floor covering. 
The floor covering of claim 1, wherein the first 
or second, or both, thermoplastic backing layers (18,24) 

comprise a polymer-modified bitumen to provide for direct 
adhesion of the polymer-modified bitumen backing layers to 

the surfaces of the polymeric foam layer (22). 
The floor covering of claim 2, wherein the 
polymer-modified bitumen backing layer (18,24) comprises 

from about 1% to 15% by weight of a polymer selected from a 
group consisting of: polyethylene, polyurethane and 

stryrene-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic block co-polymers. 
The floor covering of any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the polymeric foam layer (22) comprises a 

cross-linked, thermoset polyethylene foam layer. 
The floor covering of any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the polymeric foam layer (22) has a 

thickness of from about 4mm to 16mm. 
The floor covering of any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the first and second thermoplastic backing  

 
layers (18,24) include a porous, non-woven, glass fiber 

tissue sheet material. 
The floor covering of any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the total thickness of the first and second 

backing layers (18,24) does not exceed the thickness of the 
polymeric foam layer (22). 
The floor covering of claim 7, wherein the 
thickness of the first and second backing layers (18,24) is 

of about the same thickness. 
A method of preparing a floor covering, which 
method comprises: 


a) providing a primary backing layer (12) having a 
fibrous face wear surface (14) and a back surface; 
b) bonding a first solid thermoplastic backing 
layer (18) to the back surface of the primary backing layer; 
c) bonding one surface of a non-elastomeric, low density polymeric foam layer 
(22) to the first thermoplastic backing layer (18), the 

polymeric foam layer having a high compression 
set and a low compression strength; and 
d) bonding a second solid thermoplastic backing 
layer (24) to the other surface of the polymeric foam layer 

(22), the first and second backing layers (18,24) ranging in 
thickness from about 0.5 mm to 4 mm to disperse the 

mechanical force on the foam layer (22), and to provide a 
floor covering with the first and second thermoplastic 

backing layers (18,24) providing protection of the polymeric 
foam layer (22) from excessive compressive set. 
The method of claim 9, which includes employing 
adhesive tie layers to bond th
e surfaces of the polymeric 
foam layer (22) to the first and second thermoplastic 

backing layers (18,24). 
The method of claim 9 or claim 10, which 
includes separately preparing the first and second 

thermoplastic backing layers (18,24) and the polymeric foam 
layer (22) and thereafter laminating one surface of the 

first thermoplastic backing layer (18) to the back surface  
 

of the primary backing layer (12). 
The method of any one of claims 9 to 11, which 
includes placing a glass fiber tissue sheet material (20) 

onto the surface of the polymeric foam layer (22) and 
between the foam layer (22) and the first thermoplastic 

backing layer (18). 
A floor covering or method as claimed in any one 
of the preceding claims, wherein the polymeric foam layer 

(22) is of over 80% closed cell content.
