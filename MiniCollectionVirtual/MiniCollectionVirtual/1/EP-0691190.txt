<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for manufacturing filmstrips 
having a variable length and a variable number of 

perforations from a long strip of continuous film, a 
die set device (45) is provided with a plurality of punch 

holders (46a,47a,48a) aligned adjacent to one another in a film 
transporting direction. At least one of the punch 

holders are selectively actuated to make a designated 
number of equally spaced perforations at a time. A film 

length adjusting device (58) is provided for adjusting the 
length of the continuous film extending between the die 

set device (45) and a cutter (28) in accordance with a unit 
length which is determined for each variable length of 

the filmstrip, such that the cutter (28) and the punch 
holder or punch holders are actuated in synchronism 

with each other while the continuous film stops after 
each transport by the unit length. A pair of feed 

rollers (64,65) are disposed between the cutter (28) and a suction 
drum (60) for transporting the film toward the cutter (28). The 

feed rollers (64,65) have diameters less than that of the 
suction drum (60). A side-printer (27) is arranged to record data 

on the film at a peripheral position of a larger one of 
the feed rollers (64,65).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
for manufacturing photographic filmstrips from a long
strip of photographic film, especially for
manufacturing photographic filmstrips having one or two
perforations and data per picture frame along one or
both of lateral sides thereof by perforating, data
recording and cutting the long film.Leader-advancing type photographic film
cassette have been disclosed, e.g., in U.S.P. No.
4,846,418, in which the whole length of a filmstrip is
contained within a cassette shell, and a film leader of
the filmstrip can be advanced to the outside of the
cassette shell by rotating a spool of the cassette.
With this type of film cassette, a camera need not have
such a sprocket wheel that has conventionally been used
for feeding the film leader to the take-up spool of the
camera. Once the film leader has been engaged with the
take-up spool, the filmstrip may be advanced by
rotating the take-up spool. Therefore, the filmstrip of 
the leader-advancing type cassette need not have a lot
of successive perforations which like conventional
135-type filmstrips have for engagement with the
sprocket wheel or the take-up spool.Still, in order to advance the filmstrip one
frame after each exposure, also the filmstrip of the
leader advancing type cassette has at least a
perforation per picture frame. The perforation is
intended to be detected by a photo-sensor in the camera
to determine each frame exposure location and position
it in an exposure aperture of the camera. Since these
perforations for frame positioning are disposed in
association with the frame exposure locations, the
filmstrip of the leader advancing type cassette,
hereinafter referred to as a new type filmstrip, has no
positioning perforation in its leader and trailer where
no picture frame is to be recorded. Hereinafter, a
section which extends over the frame exposure locations
of each individual filmstrip will be referred to as a
recording section.For providing perforations only in the
recording sections of the filmstrips to be made frame
the long film, it is hard to use a conventional
perforating method for the 135-type film, such as
disclosed in JPA 61-214999 and JPY 4-2800, wherein
perforations are formed at constant intervals all along 
the long film while the long film is continuously
transported.For this reason, apparatuses for
manufacturing the new type filmstrip have been
suggested, one of which uses a die set having a number
of punches and dies corresponding to the number of
frame exposure locations to be
