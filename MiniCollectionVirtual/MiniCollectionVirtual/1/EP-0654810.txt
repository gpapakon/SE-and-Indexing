<ABSTRACT>
An improved color picture tube (8) includes an 
evacuated envelope (10) having a rectangular faceplate panel 

(12). The panel includes a viewing screen (22) on an inner 
surface thereof and a shadow mask (24) mounted therein. The 

shadow mask includes an apertured contoured portion (26) and a 
reinforcing structure (42) peripherally attached to the apertured 

portion. The reinforcing structure and a portion (30) of the mask 
form a box-like enclosure (43) around the periphery of the mask. 

The reinforcing structure is constructed of a material that has 
approximately the same thickness as does the material of the 

apertured contoured portion of the shadow mask.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color picture tubes of the 
type having shadow masks that are suspended in relation to 
cathodoluminescent screens, and particularly to an improved 
lighter-weight shadow mask. As the sizes of color picture tubes have increased, 
there has been a corresponding increase in the sizes and weights 
of tube components. One of these components is a mask-frame 
assembly. Present color picture tubes use steel frames to support 
shadow masks within faceplate panels of the tubes. One type of 
frame is made from a continuous piece of L-shaped steel that is 
bent and welded to itself at its ends. Another type of frame is 
formed by pressing a flat steel sheet into the shape of the frame. 
Typically, for a 31V tube with a 79 cm diagonal screen, these 
types of frames are made from materials that are about 1.00 mm 
(0.039 inch) thick and weigh about 1.63 kg (3.6 lbs). Other frames 
can be as thick as 1.51 mm (0.062 inch) and are proportionately 
heavier. The frames are usually rectangularly shaped and 
supported within faceplate panels by either three or four springs 
that are attached to the sides of the frames; alternatively, the 
frames may be supported at their four corners. Embodiments for 
achieving such corner support are shown in U.S. Patent 4,723,088, 
issued to Sone et al. on February 2, 1988, and U.S. Patent 
4,728,853, issued to Sone et al. on March 1, 1988. Because of the considerable weight of a conventional 
mask- frame assembly, there is an opportunity to reduce the 
overall weight of the tube, if the need for a support frame can be 
eliminated. The present invention provides a shadow mask that 
does not utilize a conventional frame. An improved color picture tube in accordance with the 
present invention includes an evacuated envelope having a 
rectangular faceplate panel. The panel includes a viewing screen 
on an inner surface thereof and a shadow mask mounted therein. 
The shadow mask includes an apertured contoured portion and a 
reinforcing structure peripherally attached to the apertured 
portion. The reinforcing structure and a portion of the mask form 
a box-like enclosure around the periphery of the mask.  
 
The reinforcing structure is constructed of a material that has 
approximately the same thickness as does the shadow mask 
material. In the drawings: 
FIGURE 1 is an axially sectioned side view of a color 
picture tube embodying the present invention. FIGURE 2 is a bottom view of a quadrant of the 
faceplate panel and shadow mask of the tube of Figure 1. FIGURE

characterized in that 
   said shadow mask includes an apertured contoured 

portion (26) and a reinforcing structure (42,62) peripherally 
attached to said apertured contoured portion, said reinforcing 

structure and a portion (30, 64, 72, 82) of said mask forming a 
box-like enclosure (43, 61, 73, 86) around the periphery of said 

mask, and said reinforcing structure being constructed from 
material that has approximately the same thickness as does the 

material of said apertured contoured portion of said mask.

that said support means (34) are located at each corner of said 

panel (12) and include a bracket (40) and a spring (38), said 
bracket including a center section (46) and two legs (48, 50) that 

extend along adjacent sides of said mask (24), said legs being 
welded to said mask, and said spring being welded to said center 

section. 
A color picture tube (8) including an evacuated 
envelope (10) having a rectangular faceplate panel (12), said 

panel including a viewing screen (22) on an inner surface thereof

rt 
means (34) located at the four corners of said panel, said shadow 

mask including an apertured contoured portion (26) and a 
peripheral skirt (30, 64, 72, 82), characterized in that 

   said shadow mask includes a C-shaped reinforcing 
structure (42, 62, 74, 84) peripherally attached to said skirt, said 

reinforcing structure and said skirt forming a box-like enclosure 
(43, 61, 73, 86) around the periphery of said mask, and said 

reinforcing structure being constructed of a material having 
approximately the same thickness as does the material of said 

apertured contoured portion of said shadow mask.
