<ABSTRACT>
A polishing apparatus for polishing a workpiece such 
as a semiconductor wafer has a turntable with an abrasive cloth 

mounted on an upper surface thereof, and a top ring for holding 
a workpiece and pressing the workpiece against the abrasive 

cloth under a first pressing force to polish the workpiece. 
The top ring has a recess defined therein for accommodating the 

workpiece therein. A presser ring is vertically movably 
disposed around the top ring, and pressed against the abrasive 

cloth under a variable second pressing force. The first and 
second pressing forces are variable independently of each 

other, and the second pressing force is determined based on the 
first pressing force.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for and
a method of polishing a workpiece such as a semiconductor wafer
to a flat mirror finish, and more particularly to an apparatus
for and a method of polishing a workpiece such as a
semiconductor wafer which can control the amount of a material
removed from a peripheral portion of the workpiece by a
polishing action.Recent rapid progress in semiconductor device
integration demands smaller and smaller wiring patterns or
interconnections and also narrower spaces between
interconnections which connect active areas. One of the
processes available for forming such interconnection is
photolithography. Though the photolithographic process can
form interconnections that are at most 0.5 Âµm wide, it requires
that surfaces on which pattern images are to be focused by a
stepper be as flat as possible because the depth of focus of
the optical system is relatively small.It is therefore necessary to make the surfaces of
semiconductor wafers flat for photolithography. One customary
way of flattening the surfaces of semiconductor wafers is to
polish them with a polishing apparatus.Conventionally, a polishing apparatus has a turntable
and a top ring which rotate at respective individual speeds.
A polishing cloth is attached to the upper surface of the 
turntable. A semiconductor wafer to be polished is placed on
the polishing cloth and clamped between the top ring and the
turntable. An abrasive liquid containing abrasive grains is
supplied onto the polishing cloth and retained on the polishing
cloth. During operation, the top ring exerts a certain
pressure on the turntable, and the surface of the semiconductor
wafer held against the polishing cloth is therefore polished to
a flat mirror finish while the top ring and the turntable are
rotating.Attempts have heretofore been made to apply an
elastic pad of polyurethane or the like to a workpiece holding
surface of the top ring for uniformizing a pressing force
applied from the top ring to the semiconductor wafer. If the
pressing force applied from the top ring to the semiconductor
wafer is uniformized, the semiconductor wafer is prevented from
being excessively polished in a local area, and hence is
planarized to a highly flat finish.FIG. 15 of the accompanying drawings shows a
conventional polishing apparatus. As shown in FIG. 15, the
conventional polishing apparatus comprises a turntable 41 with
an abrasive cloth 42 attached to an upper surface thereof, a
top ring 45 for holding a semiconductor wafer 43 to press the
semico
