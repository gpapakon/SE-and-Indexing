<ABSTRACT>
Process for the treatment, by alkaline attack according to the Bayer process, of mixed bauxite or alumina trihydrate bauxite also containing alumina in the monohydrate state in the proportion by weight of at least 5% of the total amount of alumina in the bauxite. Liquors containing a high concentration of caustic soda are used during the 2 low- and high-temperature attacks on the bauxite, the liquor of the 1st attack consisting of the mixture of an aliquot of decomposed liquor with the liquor, separated simply by settling, resulting from the attack at high temperature on residues of the 1st attack containing alumina monohydrate. From the supersaturated liquor resulting from the 1st attack, after separation by settling, filtration and dilution in order to reduce caustic soda concentration, the precipitation is carried out, by decomposition in the presence of an initiator, of a high purity trihydrate with a high productivity and an extraction yield of dissolvable alumina greater than 95%.

A process for the treatment of bauxite containing alumina 
trihydrate and alumina monohydrate in a proportion of at 

least 5 % by weight of the total quantity of alumina in 
said bauxite, by low temperature caustic soda digestion 

of the ground bauxite to form a suspension which is 
decanted and filtered to separate a supersaturated sodium 

aluminate liquor for decomposition in the presence of a 
seed and an insoluble residue containing red mud and 

alumina monohydrate, said insoluble residue then being 
digested in a caustic soda medium at a higher temperature 

to dissolve the alumina monohydrate in the form of a 
sodium aluminate liquor which is separated from the red 

mud by decantation, the processbeing characterised by the 
following combination of operations: 


a) low temperature digestion, or first digestion, of the 
ground bauxite by bringing it into contact with a liquor 

with a caustic soda concentration greater than or equal 
to 150 g Na
2
O/litre and R
p
 of between 0.6 and 0.9, said 
digestion liquor being constituted by a mixture of an 

aliquot of spent liquor from a previous decomposition 
operation, with a decanted liquor from the high 

temperature digestion step, or second digestion step, for 
the insoluble residue, 
b) after a contact time sufficient to dissolve the alumina 
trihydrate, decanting the suspension formed in the 

presence of a flocculent to separate a supersaturated 
sodium aluminate liquor with an R
p
 of between 1.20 and 
1.35 and caustic soda concentration of at least 160 g 

Na
2
O/litre from the insoluble residue, 
c) filtering then diluting the filtered supersaturated 
liquor with the wash water for the alumina trihydrate 

produced in the preceding cycle to reduce the 
concentration to less than 160 g Na
2
O/litre, 
d) decomposing the supersaturated sodium aluminate liquor 
after dilution in the presence of a seed to precipitate  

 
alumina trihydrate where the wash water after filtration 

is preferably used as diluting water for the 
supersaturated liquor at the start of the decomposition 

step, 
e) recycling the decomposed liquor to the head of the 
process in three aliquots which are respectively 

reintroduced to the grinding and second digestion steps 
as well as to the first digestion step after mixing with 

the decanted liquor from the second digestion step, 
f) high temperature digestion, or second digestion, of the 
insoluble residue from decantation and filtration of the 

suspension previously formed by bringing it into contact 
with an aliquot of spent liquor for a sufficient time to 

dissolve the alumina monohydrate contained in the 
insoluble residue and form a suspension of red mud in a 

sodium aluminate liquor with an R
p
 of less than 1, 
g) decanting and counter-current washing the insoluble 
residue from the second digestion step constituted mainly 

by red mud which is eliminated while the sodium aluminate 
liquor with R
p
 
<
 1 from the second digestion step is 
recycled to the head of the process to form the liquor 

for the first digestion step following mixture with an
