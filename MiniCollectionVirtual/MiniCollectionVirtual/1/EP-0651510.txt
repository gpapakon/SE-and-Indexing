<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to input and output devices, in
particular a stage of both input and output which may be
configured to operate with low and high voltages.Circuits of this type are known from JP-A-62 035 958 and
EP-A-0 096 637.
It is well recognized that standard input and output stages
have some limitations to their operation which are mainly
due to the technologies employed in their making.Specifically, said input and output stages are implemented
in technologies which forbid implementation on the same
chip of circuit portions which operate with low voltages
and circuit portions which operate with high voltages.The technical problem underlining the present invention is
that of realizing a mixed technology stage of both input
and output which may be configured to operate with low and
high voltages.In fact, by using a mixed technology, both low and high
voltage circuit portions can be implemented on one chip.The above technical problem is solved by a stage of both
input and output as defined in Claim 1.The features and advantages of a stage of both input and
output according to the invention will be apparent from the
following description of an embodiment thereof, given by
way of example and not of limitation with reference to the
accompanying drawing.The single Figure of the drawing shows a circuit diagram
for a stage of both input and output according to the
invention.The circuit layout of a stage (1) of both input and output,
implemented in a mixed technology and shown in the enclosed 
drawing, comprises a first transistor (M1) of the P-channel
MOS type, and second (M2) and third (M3) transistors of the
N-channel DMOS type which can be operated with a high
voltage, each of the aforesaid three transistors having a
source terminal, a drain terminal, and a gate terminal.Specifically, the source, drain, and gate terminals of the
first transistor (M1) are connected respectively to a first
terminal of a voltage supply, to the source terminal of the
second transistor (M2), and to drive means which are not
shown in the drawing.The drain and gate terminals of the second transistor (M2)
are connected respectively to a circuit node (A) forming an
input/output terminal for the stage (1), and to switching
circuit means (2).The source, drain, and gate terminals of the third
transistor (M3) are respectively connected to a second
terminal of the voltage supply, which is at a lower
potential than the first terminal, to the circuit node (A),
and to the drive means.The switching circuit means (2) are adapted to
