<DESCRIPTION>
 Method and apparatus for the measurement of pollutants in liquids This invention relates to apparatus and methods used for the measurement of concentration of chemical pollutants such as ammonia, nitrate ion, organic matter and suspended matter in fluids such as water.An instrument has been developed to use absorption of radiation for the on-line determination of the concentration of contaminants such as nitrate ion, ammonia and organic matter which are indicative of the extent of pollution occurring in a wide range of natural and processed waters.UV spectroscopy can be utilised for the determination of most organic and certain non-organic compounds (e.g. chlorine) using simple techniques. It relies on the absorption of light in a more restricted band than the visible i.e. from 180 to400nm. Many elements absorb ultra-violet light selectively in the band from 200 to 300nm, each at a specific wavelength. The absorption peak profile is wide since it results from absorptions from different origins, mainly due to electronic transitions on to which vibrations, rotations and translation are superimposed. As a consequence, characterisation of the sensing wavelength is not very specific. It is not always possible to provide light of adequate intensity at the wavelength of peak absorption. Hence an adjacent wavelength must be used, even though it reduces the sensitivity somewhat.Another alternative which is more complex and costly would be the use of a grating system to provide any particular wavelength and deconvoluting the spectra obtained. However, in the simple system chosen, deviations from the peak absorption wavelength do not give rise to major difficulties.According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for measuring the level of a contaminant in a fluid comprising a measuring chamber, a first source of optical radiation of predetermined wavelength adapted to direct said 

radiation through said chamber, detector means to detect the radiation after passage through the measuring chamber, pump means to urge a fluid under test from a fluid source to said measuring chamber, fluid processing means positioned between said fluid source and said measuring chamber to process said fluid to change an optical effect of said contaminant, bypass means to bypass said fluid processing means and valve1 means alternately to direct said fluid to said processing means and said bypass means. The invention will now be particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:Figures 1 to 19
