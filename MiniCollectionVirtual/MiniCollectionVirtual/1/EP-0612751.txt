<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
preparation of novel cephem derivatives useful as 
antibiotic agents and also to synthesis intermediates 
therefor. Cephem derivatives having an ammoniopropenyl 
group at the 3-position thereof have heretofore been 
known in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Nos. 
172493/1984 and 5094/1986. The present inventors have found that novel 
cephem derivatives having an ammoniopropenyl group at 
the 3-position thereof and a fluorine-substituted lower 
alkoxyimino group at the 7-side chain thereof have 
excellent antibacterial activities, leading to 
establishment of their preparation process. An object of this invention is therefore to 
provide a process for the preparation of such cephem 
derivatives and also synthesis intermediates therefor.  In one aspect of this invention, there is thus 
provided a process for the preparation of a cephem 
derivative represented by the following formula: 
wherein R₁ means a fluorine-substituted lower alkyl 
and A₁ denotes a cyclic or acyclic ammonio group, or 
a non-toxic salt thereof, which comprises reacting a 
compound represented by the following formula: 
wherein A₁ has the same meaning as defined above, a 
compound obtained by blocking the -COO⁻ of said 
another compound with a protecting group, or a salt 
thereof, with another compound represented by the 
following formula: 
wherein R₁ has the same meaning as defined above, a 
compound obtained by blocking the amino group of the  
 
first-mentioned compound with a protecting group, a 
reactive derivative of the first-mentioned compound at 
the carboxyl group thereof, or a salt thereof and if 
necessary, removing the protecting groups. In another aspect of this invention, there is 
also provided a compound represented by the following 
formula: 
wherein R₆ means an amino group or an amino group 
blocked by a protecting group, and A₂ denotes a group 
represented by the following formula: 
all R₇ being either the same or different and meaning 
individually a lower alkyl group and R₈ denoting a 
lower alkyl group substituted by a hydroxyl group 
and/or a carbamoyl group, a compound obtained by 
blocking -COO⁻ of the first-mentioned compound with a 
protecting group, or a salt thereof. In a further aspect of this invention, there is 
also provided a process for the preparation of the  
 
compound, -COO⁻-protected derivative thereof or salt 
according to said another aspect of this invention. 
The process comprises reacting a compound represented 
by the following formula:
