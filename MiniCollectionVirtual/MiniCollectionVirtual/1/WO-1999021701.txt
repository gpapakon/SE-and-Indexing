<ABSTRACT>
A composite blade (10, 10A through 10F) for use in a tire cure mold on the method of fabricating the composite blade employs the steps of forming a blade blank (12) and encapsulating at least one end (14, 16) in a second material by placing the end (14, 16) in a die and molding an enlarged cross section (20) of a second material around the end (14, 16). Preferably the second material is a powdered metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ARTICLE AND METHOD FOR COMPOSITE TTRE MOLD BLADES Technical Field The present invention relates to blades for the curing mold. More particularly to a composite type blade which has rounded ends and a method of fabricating such composite blades. Background of the InventionBlades for tire curing molds are well known in the art of tire manufacture. Such blades are conventionally made from a running length or strip of a metallic material such as steel, stainless steel or brass. The strip is generally about 0.020 inches to 0.040 inches thick and has a width of about one half to 1-1/2 inches. Sometimes the strips are of solid form other times perforated strips are used to form the blade.In US patent 3,880,020 a method and apparatus for making blades is disclosed which enables small quantity lots of a multiplicity of different styles of blades to be made rapidly and economically. The method and apparatus permits blades to be blanked out from the stack of material by a plurality of punch and die sets while the stock remains securely attached to an endless loop carrier. The invention uses a plurality of sub-presses for forming bends in the blade if desired.In U.S. Patent 3,581,535 a similar method and apparatus for making blades is disclosed. The method and apparatus for making blades for use in tire molds includes piercing, notching, bending or otherwise altering the shape of a free end of strip material by successively positioning the free end and a plurality of shape altering tools in operative engagement and cutting off the formed blade from the free end.The reader can appreciate or visualize finished blades of a given style falling into a large box after being formed and cut from the strip of blade stock.The complexity of this automated blade forming apparatus make it abundantly clear that the formed blade must be rather simple in construction as shown in the appended prior art Figs. 4 through 9. Bends, cuts, notches and holes are possible. What has not been possible to date was the employment of more complex shapes or varying the thickness of the blade at a specific location.The blade creates a sipe, which is a narrow groove or incision in the tread. The lateral ends of the blade, even if polished or ground round is a subsequent deburring operations, are sufficiently narrow to initiate crack propagation at this highly stressed region of tread.To avoid this problem it has been an objective of the present invention to create blade ends and blade bends that are effective at stress relieving the tread

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS
1. A blade for use in a tire mold, the blade being characterized by: a blade blank having at least two ends; at least one end cap having a substantially larger cross-section relative to the blade blank, the end cap being attached to one end of the blade blank.
2. The blade of claim 1 , wherein the end cap is of a second material the second material being a powdered metal.
3. The blade of claim 1 , wherein at least one of the ends of the blade blank is crimped.
4. The blade of claim 1 , wherein at least one of the ends of the blade blank is notched. 5. The blade of claim 1, wherein the blade blank has one or more bends between the two ends.
6. The blade of claim 1 , wherein the blade further is characterized by bend caps, the bend caps having substantially rounded cross-section, each bend cap being attached to a blade blank at a bend. 7. The blade of claim 1 , wherein the blade blank is steel.
8. The blade of claim 1 , wherein of the end cap cross-section is substantially rounded.
9. A method of fabricating a composite blade for use in a tire mold comprising the steps of: forming a blade blank having at least two ends; placing one or more ends of the blade blank in a die and molding a second material forming an end cap at least partially encapsulating the one or more ends of the blade blank.
10. The method of fabricating a composite blade of claim 9 further include the step of crimping the one or more ends of the blade blank, prior to molding a second material thus encapsulating the crimped end.
11. The method of fabricating a composite blade of claim 9, further includes the step of notching the one or more ends of the blade blank prior to molding the second material thus encapsulating the notched end.
12. The method of fabricating a composite blade of claim 9, wherein the second material for forming the rounded end is a powdered metal.
13. The method of fabricating a composite blade for use in a tire mold comprising the steps of: form a blade blank having two or more ends and at least one bend located between the two ends; placing at least one bend of the blade blank in a die and molding a second material forming a bend cap at least partially encapsulating the bend of the blade blank.
