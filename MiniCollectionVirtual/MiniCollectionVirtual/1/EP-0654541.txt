<ABSTRACT>
A golf club head is formed of an alloy steel which 
comprises at most 0.2 wt.% of C, 0.05-1.0 wt.% of Si, at 

most 0.5 wt.% of Mn, 3.0-8.0 wt.% of Ni, 10.0-20.0 wt.% of 
Cr, 3.0-8.0 wt.% of Mo and 10.0-20.0 wt.% of Co, the 

remainder being substantially Fe, and has a metallic 
texture composed principally of martensite.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal head
for a golf club, which is tough and has a relatively large
volume without increasing the weight, and can be
manufactured with ease.Metal wood heads and iron heads are generally
produced by a precision casting process (lost wax process)
using, as a material, a stainless steel such as SUS 630
[AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) Standard Type
630] or SUS 431 (AISI Standard Type 431).It is desirable for a golf-club head to make a
golf club to which the head has been attached which is
easy to swing and hard to cause a bad shot. Therefore,
efforts have been made in reducing the weight of the head
to make it easy to swing a golf-club to which the head has
been attached, and widening the sweet spot in a face of
the head or increasing the moment of inertia of the head
to lessen the chance of a bad shot. With a wide sweet
spot of the head, the course of flying of a hit ball
becomes stable even if a hitting position in the face at
which a ball is hit is irregular, and thus, the chance of
a bad shot can be decreased. On the other hand, a high moment of inertia of
the head suppresses the turning of the head due to a shock
upon hitting a golf ball, bringing a substantial widening
of the sweet spot that stabilizes the course of flying of
the hit ball.In the case of a metal wood head of a hollow
structure, for example, a portion near the sole of the
head is made heavier than its crown to lower the center of
gravity, whereby the sweet spot can be widened. It is
also possible to increase the volume of the head, thereby
to increase the moment of inertia of the head and widen
the sweet spot.In the case of an iron head on the other hand, a
peripheral portion of the head, such as a toe or a heel,
can be made heavier than a portion about the center of
gravity of the head, thereby widening the sweet spot.With an increased overall weight of a head, even
if the sweet spot can be widened, it becomes difficult to
swinging the golf-club to which the head has been
attached. On the other hand, when the shell thickness of
a head is thinned wholly or partly to suppress the weight,
disadvantages of a reduced strength of the head and/or a
lowered rebound of the ball upon hitting may arise. In
the case of a head made of a conventional stainless steel,
since the reduction of their thicknesses has reached the
lower limit, widening of the sweet spot by the above-described 
methods is difficult to achieve.There has been developed a golf-club head made
of a titanium alloy. The titanium alloy
