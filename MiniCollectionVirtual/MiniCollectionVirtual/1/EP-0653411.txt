<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for preparing alkyl tertiary alkyl ethers, 
especially methyl t-butyl ether, in one step comprises 

reacting tertiary alcohol and primary alcohol in the presence 
of a catalyst comprising β-zeolite modified with one or more 

metals selected from Group VIII of the Periodic Table. 
Optionally, the catalyst may be further modified with a 

halogen or a Group IB metal. The catalyst is preferably used 
in the presence of Group III oxide binder and, typically the 

reaction is carried out at a temperature of about 20°C to 
250°C under a pressure from 0.1 to 7 MPa. In reaction between 

tertiary butanol and methanol, when the temperature is in the 
operating range above about 140°C, the product comprises a 

two-phase mix of an MTBE-isobutylene and, optionally, 
diisobutylene product-rich phase and a heavier aqueous 

ethanol-rich phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an improved process for preparing
alkyl tertiary alkyl ethers and particularly methyl tertiary
butyl ether (MTBE) in one step by the reaction of tertiary
butanol and methanol in the presence of a catalyst comprising
a Beta (β) zeolite modified with one or more metals selected
from Group VIII of the Periodic Table, as defined in the
Condensed Chemical Dictionary, page 789 and further modified
with a halogen selected from the group consisting of fluorine,
chlorine, bromine and iodine. Particularly good
etherification activity has been observed using platinum or
palladium. The novel catalysts may optionally be further
treated with a Group IB metal. The invention is especially
advantageous in that the platinum/palladium-modified zeolites
exhibit both high activity during methyl t-butyl ether
synthesis from methanol plus t-butanol, as well as ethyl
t-butyl ether synthesis from ethanol plus t-butanol.
Additionally, they allow for the co-synthesis of isobutylene
and diisobutylene.It is well-known that there is pressure to eliminate lead
compounds from automotive fuels for reasons of public health
and environmental protection. Although the specifications for
reformulated gasolines set by EPA will come into force in
1995, standards were brought into force in the United States
on November 1, 1992 requiring gasoline to contain 2.7 wt%
oxygen during the winter in nonattainment areas of the U.S.
If the federal air quality standard for CO has not been
achieved by a specified attainment date, the minimum oxygen
content will be increased to 3.1%. Moreover, with effect from
the summer of 1992, the maximum blending Reid vapour pressure
(BRvp) of all gasolines was set at 9.0 psi (0.06 MPa). Since
oxygenates are not only used as gasoline blending components,
extenders, octane boosters and as key ingredients for reducing
the emissions of CO and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), it
is expected that the demand for oxygenates will increase
enormously in the coming years. Of all oxygenates, the tertiary ethers, such as methyl
t-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and
tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) are preferred by refineries to
lighter alcohols. They have lower blending Reid vapour
pressure (BRvp), lower vaporization latent heats and low
solubilities in water. The most common ether in use today is
MTBE with a production of about 25 million metric tons.
However, ETBE is becoming more attractive as the price of
methanol goes up in relation to gasoline. It can be produced
from renewable
