<ABSTRACT>
Silica-pillared mica microporous materials of low 
acidity, useful as sorbents and catalytic supports, are produced 

by intercalating an organosilicon oligomer/precursor into a 
layered fluoromica, followed by calcination, washing and 

re-calcination.

<DESCRIPTION>
Oxide-pillared clays, including micas, are well known as microporous 
materials that can serve as catalysts and catalyst supports for a variety of 
hydrocarbon reactions. The present invention relates to a method of producing a silica-pillared 
mica, comprising the steps of: 
(a) contacting a fluoromica having layers therein with a material 
selected from organosilicon oligomer precursors and organosilicon oligomers for a time 
and at a temperature sufficient to allow said material to intercalate between said 
layers of the fluoromica; (b) calcining said fluoromica having said material diffused therein 
for a time ranging from 1 to 24 hours and at a temperature ranging from 200 to 600°C 
sufficient to decompose said material into a silica pillar and to form an intermediate 
pillared mica product; (c) washing said calcined intermediate pillared mica product; and (d) recalcining said washed and calcined intermediate pillared mica 
product for a time ranging from 1 to 24 hours and at a temperature reaching at least 
100°C higher than that reached in step (b), to form a silica pillared mica. The organosilicon oligomer precursors and organosilicon oligomers 
may have a polyhedral silicon-oxygen skeleton bearing organic substituents attached 
to said silicon of said silicon-oxygen skeleton and wherein said organic substituents 
have been removed from said silicon-oxygen skeleton. The silica-pillared mica 
prepared from sodium tetrasilicic fluoromica in accordance with the present invention 
normally has a silica content of at least about 30 wt.% as Si; A BET surface area of 
more than 50 m2/g, preferably between 200 and 400 m2/g; and an average layer repeat  
 
distance measured by X-ray diffraction of between 16 and 20 Angstroms. Decompose 
as used herein means that the pillaring material is wholly or partially converted into 
silica. "Bet" is the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller nitrogen absorption method. By varying the composition of either the oxide pillars of the mica 
layers, materials with desired properties can be produced. The present invetion 
enables the production of a pillared mica with little or no acidity, that can be used as a 
sorbent or as a support for noble metal catalysts. Additionally, the present invention enables the preparation of pillared 
micas of significantly increased surface area and microporosity, making the materials 
more desirable for use as catalysts, catalyst supports, and sorbents. The silica-pillared micas are prepared in accordance with the 
invention from synthetic fluoromicas
