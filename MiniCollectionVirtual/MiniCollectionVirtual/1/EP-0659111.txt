<ABSTRACT>
Process for the controlled moulding-thermoforming of plastic parts. According to the invention, at least one blank (4) of plastic material (P1), previously heated so as to include areas of different temperature, is fed into a mould cavity (1). The part is formed in the mould by using a punch (3) movable in said mould cavity (1) and/or by using the injection pressure of a plastic material (P2) fed into said cavity at a temperature in the region of, or equal to, the melting point temperature. Application in the manufacture of prostheses.

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing parts of plastics material by moulding-thermoforming, 
of the type comprising introduction of at least one preform (4) of 

plastics material P1 into a moulding cavity (1) and optionally introduction into the said 
moulding cavity (1) of plastics material P2 at a temperature close to or equal to the 

melting point of the plastics material P2, according to which the said preform is first 
heated in such a manner that it has zones at different temperatures, at least one of the 

temperature zones being close to or equal to the melting point of the plastics material 
P1, and according to which the part is shaped in the mould by means of a die (3) 

movable into the moulding cavity (1) and/or of the pressure of injection of the plastics 
material P2 when this is injected. 
A manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized in that the preform 
(4) of plastics material P1 has at least one temperature zone close to or equal to the 

melting point of P1. 
A manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized in that the plastics 
material P1 is reinforced by means of a suitable reinforcing material before it is 

introduced into the moulding cavity (1). 
A manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized in that an 
independent reinforcing element is introduced before or after the introduction of the 

plastics material P1 into the moulding cavity. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the preform (4) is formed 
from at least one non-injectable thermoplastic material P1, such as a plastics material 

of very high molecular weight. 
A process according to claim 5, characterized in that the preform (4) is a 
polymer whose chains of molecules are orientated parallel to the rubbing surface at 

least in the zone of the part beneath or flush with this surface.  
 
A process according to claim 1, 3 or 4, characterized in that the plastics 
material P2 is reinforced. 
A process according to claim 3, 4 or 7, characterized in that the reinforcement 
is formed by a woven material. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the die (3) is displaced 
until it comes into contact preferably with the preform (4) in such a manner as to force 

the preform (4) to assume the profile of the closed matrix formed by the walls of the 
moulding cavity (1) and of the die (3). 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the plastics material P2 is 
injected until it comes into contact preferably with the preform (4) in such a manner as 

to force the preform to assume the profile of the closed matrix formed by the walls of 
the moulding cavity (1) and of the die (3) in a position entering the said cavity (1). 
A process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that at 
least the plastics material P1 is put into the shape of an implant under the action of the 

injection pressure of the plastics material P2 and/or of the movable die (3). 
A process according to claim 11, characterized in that the said implant is a 
cotyle. 
A process according to any of claims 1 to 10, characterized in that at least the 
plastics material P1 is put into the shape of mechanical part under the action of the 

injection pressure of the plastics material P2 and/or of the movable die.
