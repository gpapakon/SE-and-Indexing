<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piece of furniture 
comprising an upper part, such as a tabletop, a cupboard or 
a number of seats, and a lower part comprising rails and 
legs, in which the rails and legs at least partly consist of 
tubes, and in which the legs at their upper ends comprise a 
tubular connecting piece fixedly connected to and forming an 
angle with the leg, and in which expandable assembly means 
are used for connecting legs and rails, said assembly means 
comprising two connecting members inserted in the ends of 
adjacent tubes and which by means of one or more screws 
passed through an opening in one of the connecting members 
are kept pressed against the inner side of the tubes. Tables are known, in which the rails are made up of 
oval tubes which are connected with the tubular connecting 
pieces at the upper part of the legs. In the known table two 
connecting pieces are welded to each of the legs, said connecting 
pieces being two pipe stubs perpendicular to one 
another and having the same cross-section as the rails. The 
assembly means consist of two tube pieces placed in parallel, 
said tubes pieces being pressed apart by means of 
pointed screws, the thread of which is inserted into a 
thread in the wall of one of the tube pieces, and the front 
end of which is passed through a hole in the tube wall of 
the second tube piece. Thus, the assembly means connect two 
tube ends placed end to end, and the connection is established 
thereby that the pointed screw, after the two tube 
pieces have been inserted in the ends of the rail tube and 
the connecting piece, respectively, is tightened until the 
two tube pieces have moved so far apart that they press 
against the inner surface of the flat-oval tubes. Even though the assembly means in the shape of two 
parallelly running tubes are not resistant to torsional 
stress between the joined tube ends, it is still possible to 
build stable furniture frames provided that the rail extends 
along the edges of the upper part and connects the frame  
 
legs two by two. On account of the lacking resistance to 
torsional stress of the assembly, a bigger consumption of 
material should be expected than in connection with a construction 
fully welded together. When the rail tubes are placed upright, they contribute 
very effectively to securing the tabletop against bending. 
If the rails are placed in the border area of the 
tabletop, the free height under the table will be considerably 
reduced, and it may therefore be difficult for those 
usin
