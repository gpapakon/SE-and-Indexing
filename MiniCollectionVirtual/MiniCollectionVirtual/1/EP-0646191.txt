<DESCRIPTION>
A common problem with most protective apparel is   
lack of comfort. One is reluctant to wear a garment that 
is heavy, bulky, stiff, rough or that has poor moisture 
transfer and yet unless the garment is worn, it cannot 
provide protection. The present invention is directed to 
a woven fabric consisting essentially of poly(m-phenylene 
isophthalamide) fiber for use in protective garments of 
improved comfort. The use of such fibres in fabrics for protective 
garments is known, for example, from US-A-4 198 494. This invention provides a woven fabric for use in 
protective apparel of improved comfort consisting 
essentially of uncrystallized poly(m-phenylene 
isophthalamide) staple fiber having a denier per filament 
(dpf) of from 0.8 to 1.5 said fabric having a basis 
weight of from 135.6 to 271.2 g/m2 (4.0 to 8 ounces per square yard (oz/yd2)) 
and a construction as follows: 
weave:plain or twill metric count:62.6/2 or finer    (cotton count (cc):37/2 or finer) warp count (ends/dm):295 to 492       (ends/inch:75 to 125) fill count (ends/dm):at least 157 (40 ends/inch) but not greater than 80% of the warp count The fabrics of the invention have a bending 
rigidity per centimeter (B) no greater than 0.09 gram 
force (gf) cm2/cm, a shear stiffness (G) no greater than 
0.8 gf/cm deg., a surface roughness (SMD) no greater than 
8.0 micrometers and a peak in transient heat loss, 
(Qmax), of at least 12 watts/meter2 °C(W/M2°C), all 
measured as described below.  
 It is well known in the art that certain fabric 
characteristics translate into comfort levels that can be 
expected when such fabrics are made into apparel. The 
challenge is to attain these characteristics in high 
basis weight fabrics from fibers which are employed in 
protective apparel. The fabrics under consideration have 
a basis weight of from 136.6 g/m2 to 271.2 g/m2 (4.0 oz/yd2 to 8 oz/yd2) and are 
woven from yarns consisting essentially of poly(m-phenylene 
isophthalamide) MPD-I, staple fiber. If 
desired (although not claimed), up to 10 weight percent of 
such fiber may be 
replaced with other fiber such as p-aramid fiber, 
antistatic fiber, etc., which provide break open 
resistance, antistatic performance, etc., providing the 
value of the fabric for the protective end-use is not 
unduly compromised. The MPD-I staple fiber employed has a denier of 
from 0.8 to 1.5 dpf and the spun yarns are 62.6/2 metric count 
(37/2 cc) or 
finer. Moreover, the fiber should not be subjected to 
treatments which tend to crystallize the fiber since
