<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for the production of a compacted body 
of powdered medicament, especially powdered inhalation medicament, referred to 
herein as a "medicament compact", of the type disclosed in European Patent Application 
407028. The administration by inhalation of medicaments in dry powder form is well 
known. Devices for the metering and dispensing of measured doses of medicament 
from a reservoir have also been described previously, for example, in UK Patent No. 
2041763 and US Patent No. 2587215. Such devices typically comprise a medicament 
reservoir and a metering chamber with a volume chosen such that, when filled, the 
chamber contains the desired weight of medicament for one dose. Filling of the 
metering chamber is generally accomplished under the influence of gravity, the chamber 
typically being located at the bottom of the reservoir. Such devices have the 
disadvantage that variations in the density of the metered powder can easily occur 
resulting in inaccurate or inconsistent dosing. The packing density of the powder may 
also depend on the weight of powder remaining in the reservoir, leading to a gradual 
reduction in the dose delivered by the device. In addition, the dose metered is strongly 
dependent on the orientation of the device. European Patent Application 407028 discloses a device which overcomes the 
disadvantages of other dry powder devices by the use of a metering means which relies 
not on gravitational force to fill a metering chamber, but on abrasion of a compacted 
body of powdered medicament. This application contemplated the use of hydraulic 
presses and the like in the production of the medicament compacts, by which pressure 
would be applied in the direction of a longitudinal axis of a sample of powdered 
medicament. Although this is satisfactory in many cases, in others there is a variation 
in the density of the medicament compact from point to point. Since the device of 
European Patent Application No. 407028 (in which the medicament compacts are 
adapted for use) functions by abrading a feed volume of the medicament compact, it 
is important that the density of medicament throughout the compact is as uniform as 
possible. If the density is uniform then slices of medicament of the same thickness 
abraded from the compact will contain the same amount of medicament, thus ensuring 
that the correct dosage of medicament is consistently administered to a patient.
