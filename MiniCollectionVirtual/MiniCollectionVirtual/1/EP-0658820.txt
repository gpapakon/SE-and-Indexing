<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner for developing
electrostatic latent images in electrophotography, electrostatic
recording, electrostatic printing, etc.In copying machines etc. based on electrophotography,
various dry or wet toners containing a coloring agent, a
fixing resin and other substances are used to visualize the
electrostatic latent image formed on the photoreceptor having
a light-sensitive layer containing an inorganic or organic
photoconductive substance.The chargeability of such toners is one of the most
important factors in electrostatic latent image developing
systems. Thus, to appropriately control or stabilize the
amount of charges of the toner, a charge control agent
providing a positive or negative charge is often added to the
toner.Examples of conventional charge control agents providing
a positive charge for toners include basic dyes, such as 
nigrosine dyes and triarylmethane dyes, and electron -
donating substances, such as quaternary ammonium salts.
Examples of conventional charge control agents providing a
negative charge for toners include 2:1 metal complex salt azo
dyes.However, many of charge control agents having a dye
structure are usually of complex structure, lacking stability,
and are likely to decompose or deteriorate to lose their
charge control property due to mechanical friction and
impact, temperature and humidity changes, electric impact,
light irradiation, etc. Such charge control agents lack
versatility for color toner use, because they are colored.Negative charge control agents offering a solution to
these problems include chelate compounds with salicylic acid,
alkylsalicylic acid, oxynaphthoic acid, salicylaldehyde,
phthalic acid, or the like, as a ligand (e.g., Cr, Zn or Al
complex of salicylic acid or alkylsalicylic acid, boron
complex of salicylic acid, Cr complex of oxynaphthoic acid,
Cr or Co complex of salicylaldehyde, Cr or Fe complex of
phthalic acid). Although many of these charge control agents
of complex structure are of light color, they are not
necessarily satisfactory for use in color toners, their resin
dispersibility and charge control property stability remain
to be improved. US-PS 3,576,025 describes an alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acid pentacoordinated
silicon complex of the general formula

wherein
A is a cation formed from an amine,R is an aryl radical, eachR' is a hydrogen atom or a phenyl radical, andn is an equal to the number of protonated nitrogen atoms in A.US-PS 5,188,929 discloses a toner composition for developing an
