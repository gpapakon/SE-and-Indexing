<ABSTRACT>
A method of draining-washing of an object to the surface of which water or aqueous detergent has stuck in a washing cistern 
using hydrophobic draining detergent. The hydrophobic draining detergent in the washing cistern is circulated between said 

cistern and the reserve tank and water mixed with said hydrophobic draining detergent is removed by a concentration type filter 
disposed in the circulation passage. As a concentration type filter, mainly a hydrophobic filter is used. Draining-washing 

is conducted 
while hydrophobic draining detergent only is returned to the washing cistern after removal of the water. As a result, a concentration 

of water in hydrophobic draining detergent contained in the washing cistern can constantly be kept below a certain 
fixed value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dewatering cleaning method
and a dewatering cleaning apparatus both capable of imparting
exalted stability to the quality of cleaning.Heretofore, it has been a common practice to use a
fluorinated hydrocarbon (Flon) type solvent, a chlorine type
solvent, or the vapor thereof for washing various parts which
are smeared with oil-soluble dirt or water-soluble dirt. In
recent years, however, such detergents as the Flon type
solvent mentioned above have been arousing serious public
anxiety about the effects they produce on human bodies and the
environment. Thus, the desirability of a washing method which
is capable of superprecision washing comparable favorably with
that obtainable with the Flon type solvent without adversely
affecting the environment has been finding enthusiastic
recognition.As detergents useful as substitutes for the Flon type
solvent, therefore, various aqueous and nonaqueous substitute
detergents such as, for example, aqueous detergents and
organic solvent type chlorine-free detergents have been
proposed. The feasibility of the washing by the use of these
detergents has been being studied. Particularly the 
combination of the aqueous washing among other types of
washing with a suitable water-treating device has a bright
prospect of popular acceptance because it exerts very little
adverse effect on the environment.Since most of the substitute detergents mentioned above
require a step of rinsing to follow the step of washing, the
washing operation using such a substitute detergent generally
follows the practice of giving a rinse with water to a washed
part. After the rinse with water has been carried out, the
water adhering to the surface of the rinsed part must be
uniformly and quickly dried for the sake of quality of the
washing. By the currently prevailing method of forcibly
vaporizing water such as is effected with hot air, however, it
is very difficult to prevent occurrence of watermark on the
dried surface of the part. Besides, the vapor washing which
uses such a low boiling organic solvent as isopropyl alcohol
(hereinafter referred to as "IPA") has been in vogue. When a
part still wet with adhering water is directly subjected to
the vapor washing, however, it is very difficult to preclude
occurrence of watermark as in the case of drying with hot air.For the purpose of solving the problem described above,
the feasibility of the cleaning by displacement of water
(dewatering cleaning) using a dewatering cleaning agent has
been being studied. The dewatering
