<ABSTRACT>
A new photoacid generator having the formula 

wherein
 

   R = hydrogen, hydroxyl, or the -O-S(=O)₂-Q moiety;
 

   R¹ = CH₂OS(=O)₂-Q, or -NO₂;
 

   R² = CH₂Os(=O)₂-Q, or -NO₂;
 

   R³ = C₁-C₆ alkyl or hydrogen;
 

   R⁴= hydrogen, -CH₂OS(=O)₂-Q, or -NO₂;
 

   R⁵ = hydrogen, -CH₂OS(=O)₂-Q, or -NO₂; and
 

   Q is a diazonaphthoquinone moiety; with the proviso 
that R³ is C₁-C₆ alkyl when R² and R⁴ are NO₂, and 

with the proviso that R¹ ≠ R² and R⁴ ≠ R⁵.
 

exhibits unprecedented sensitivity to actinic radiation. 
This compound is photochemically transformed from a non-acidic 

entity to photoproducts which contain both sulfonic 
and carboxylic acid functional groups. The acid generator 

is effective with polymers having acid labile groups, 
converting them into alkaline-soluble polymers, and with 

polymers which do not have such acid labile groups. 
Positive or negative working photoresist compositions can 

be made containing the new photoacid generator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a compound which forms an acid under 
the action of actinic radiation. More particularly, it relates to 
a compound which is capable of photochemical transformation from a 
non-acidic entity to photoproducts which contain both sulfonic and 
carboxylic acid functional groups. This acid-generating compound 
is particularly suitable in a positive working photoresist wherein 
portions exposed to patterned actinic radiation are rendered 
soluble in an aqueous alkaline developer while the unexposed 
portions remain intact to form an image of the pattern. It is also 
suitable in an image reversal photoresist composition wherein the 
acid-generating compound brings about an increased crosslink 
density leading to cure. The sensitivity of photolithographic systems based on 
diazonaphthoquinone sensitized novolac resins is limited by both 
the quantum efficiency of the sensitizer to photoproduct conversion 
and the UV opacity of the novolac resins. Thus, the photoproduct 
conversion per photon of actinic radiation is generally too low for 
practical use in deep UV work because of the very low power that is 
available from exposure sources in those wavelengths. A dramatic 
increase in sensitivity in radiation-sensitive systems, often 
referred as chemical amplification, is obtained when a species 
produced in the primary photoreaction independently initiates a 
catalytic secondary reaction, thus increasing the quantum yield to 
values above one. For example, systems which photochemically 
produce a strong acid which then cleaves acid labile groups in a 
secondary reaction are disclosed in US-A-3,915,706 for 
positive working polyaldehydes.  
 US-A-5,037,721 teaches a positive radiation 
sensitive mixture that exhibits no change in the development time 
whether the time between irradiation and development is long or 
short and provides high structural resolution of the developed 
resist that is retained during processing steps subsequent to the 
development. said mixture comprises a compound which forms an acid 
under the action of actinic radiation and a particular type of 
monomeric acid-cleavable compound which contains an acetal group. 
This patent has a good discussion of the acid-cleavable materials 
which have been employed. US-A-4,491,628 shows a deep UV sensitive resist 
composition which is made by combining a polymer having recurrent 
acid labile pendant groups, e.g., poly (p-tert-butoxycarbonyloxy-α-methylstyrene), 
with a cationic photo-initiator such as an 
aryldiazonium-,
