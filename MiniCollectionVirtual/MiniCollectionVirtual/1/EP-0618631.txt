<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid electrolyte, 
to a cell containing such an electrolyte, as well a process 
for producing a fibrous ion conductive glassy solid 
electrolyte.  
 With recent development of portable appliances 
such as personal computers, portable telephones, etc., a 
demand for cells as their power source has been considerably 
increased. Particularly, lithium cells have been 
extensively studied in various fields as cells capable of 
giving a high energy density, because lithium is a 
substance having a small atomic weight and a large 
ionization energy. On the other hand, the cells so far used in 
these fields are based substantially on a liquid 
electrolyte and thus it has been impossible to eliminate 
such problems as leakage of liquid electrolyte, etc. To 
solve these problems, thereby enhancing the reliability 
and also to make the elements smaller and thinner, 
attempts for replacing the liquid electrolyte with a  
 
solid electrolyte and making an entirely solid cell have 
been extensively made in various fields. The above-mentioned lithium, when brought into 
an abnormal state, has a fear of ignition due to the high 
energy density. Thus, development of an entirely solid 
lithium cell using a solid electrolyte made from a non-combustible 
solid has been desired to ensure the safety 
of the cell. Lithium halide, lithium nitride, oxy acid 
salts of lithium, and their derivatives are known as 
solid electrolytes for use in such a cell. Furthermore, 
researches on sulfide glassy solid electrolytes such as 
Li2S-SiS2, Li2S-P2S5, Li2S-S2S3, etc. and lithium ion 
conductive solid electrolytes prepared by doping the 
above-mentioned glassy solid electrolytes with a lithium 
halide such as LiI, etc., or with an oxy acid salt of 
lithium such as Li3PO4, etc., particularly on their 
physical properties have been made in the world owing to 
their high ion conductivity such as 10-4 to 10-3 S/cm. However, these solid electrolytes are inorganic 
solid powders and thus pelletization by press molding, 
etc. are indispensable for their application to cells. 
The resulting pellets are too hard and fragile to make 
electrolytes having a smaller thickness and a larger 
area. Furthermore, the resulting electrode is fragile 
when assembled with the positive pole and the negative 
pole. To solve this problem, it has been proposed to 
integrate the inorganic solid electrolyte powders with an  
 
elastic polymer, thereby increasing the processability of 
the solid electrolyte and produce a shaped
