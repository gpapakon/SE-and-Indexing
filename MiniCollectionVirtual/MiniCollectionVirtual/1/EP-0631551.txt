<ABSTRACT>
A sledge (10) for use on snow, ice or other suitable surface comprising two elongate ski members (20) each including a forward end and a rearward end, laterally coupled together by a connecting device (32) allowing movement of one ski member (20) relative to the other ski member (20), and with a seating portion (34) situated between the two ski members (20) upon which a user of the sledge (10) may sit. Toe straps (28) or other suitable means are provided on the forward end of each ski member (20) to facilitate steering of the sledge (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sledges. Conventionally, sledges comprise two runners connected to a rigid body upon which a person 
may sit or lie. The runners are fixed relative to one another, and each have a lower surface which 
can slide over snow, ice or other suitable surfaces. A problem with known sledges is the inherent lack of manoeuvrability, and difficulty of 
changing direction of travel. DE-A-746677 discloses a sledge comprising two elongate ski members, having forward and 
rearward ends, said ski members being held in spaced-apart, side-by-side relationship and 
coupled together at a point intermediate said forward and rearward ends by a connecting device 
which serves as a seat for the user. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved sledge. According to the present invention, there is provided a sledge comprising two elongate 
ski members having forward and rearward ends, said ski members being held in spaced-apart, 
side-by-side relationship and coupled together at a point intermediate said forward and rearward 
ends by a connecting device which serves as a seat for the user characterised in that said 
connecting device is flexible and said forward and rearward ends of said ski members are not 
coupled together, the arrangement being such that, in use, one ski member may be moved relative 
to the other by the user shifting his bodyweight and thereby flexing the flexible connecting 
device. The sledge according to the invention is advantageous primarily in that the relative movement 
which is possible between the ski members enables the sledge to be manoeuvred more easily than 
is the case with conventional sledges. The sledge may be controlled simply by the user shifting  
 
his body weight, using skills similar to those used in skiing. Preferably also, the forward ends of the ski members are provided with toe straps or other means 
for gripping the user's feet to facilitate control of the sledge. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only, and with 
reference to the accompanying drawings  
 
in which: 
Figure 1 shows a plan view of a sledge according to the presently 
preferred embodiment of the present invention; Figure 2 shows a side view of the embodiment of the sledge in 
Figure 1; Figure 3 shows a plan view of a further embodiment of a sledge 
according to the present invention; Figure 4 shows a perspective view of a further embodiment of a 
sledge according to the present invention; Figure 5 shows a perspective view of

<CLAIMS>
A sledge (10) comprising two elongate ski members (20) having forward and rearward 
ends, said ski members (20) being held in spaced-apart, side-by-side relationship and coupled 

together at a point intermediate said forward and rearward ends by a connecting device (32) 
which serves as a seat for the user characterised in that said connecting device (32) is flexible and 

said forward and rearward ends of said ski members (20) are not coupled together, the 
arrangement being such that, in use, one ski member (20) may be moved relative to the other by 

the user shifting his bodyweight and thereby flexing the flexible connecting device (32). 
A sledge according to claim 1, wherein each ski member (20) includes means (28) for 
retaining the feet of a user, forward of said connecting device (32). 
A sledge according to claim 1 or claim 2, including means (30) for varying the position 
of said connecting device relative to the long axis of each ski member. 
A sledge according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said connecting device includes 
a universal joint. 
A sledge according to any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said connecting device (32) 
includes a strip of flexible material. 
A sledge according to claim 1, wherein said flexible connecting device comprises a first 
seat portion (34) attached to a first ski member (20), and a second seat portion (34) attached to 

a second ski member (20). 
A sledge according to any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein said ski members (20) each 
include a surface for contact with the ground whose width is tapered for at least part of the length 

of the ski member (20). 
A sledge according to claim 1, comprising first and second elongate ski members (20)  
 

having forward and rearward ends, said first and second elongate ski members (20) having 
respective first and second support rails (26) upwardly spaced therefrom and substantially 

parallel thereto, respective first and second seat members (34) being rigidly secured to said first 
and second support rails (26), said first and second seat members (34) extending inwardly 

towards each other and being connected by a flexible coupling (32), said forward and rearward 
ends of said ski members (20) not being so coupled together, the arrangement being such that, 

in use, said first and second ski members (20) are movable relative to each other by the user 
shifting his bodyweight and thereby flexing the flexible coupling (32).
