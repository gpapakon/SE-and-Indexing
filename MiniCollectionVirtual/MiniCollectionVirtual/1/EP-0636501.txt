<ABSTRACT>
A stick dispenser for containing sticks, such 
as spare leads for mechanical pencils or toothsticks 

comprises an outer case member (1) having an open rear 
end, and a front wall provided with a first outlet hole 

(3) through which the sticks are fed out one at a time, 
and an inner case member (2) slidably inserted in the 

outer case member (1) through the open rear end of the 
latter, provided with a cavity (6) for containing the 

sticks, and having a front wall provided with a second 
outlet hole (7). Normally, the inner case member (2) is 

biased toward one side wall of the outer case member (1) 
so that the second outlet hole (7) is out of alignment 

with the first outlet hole (3) to prevent the sticks 
from slipping out of the stick dispenser. When the 

inner case member (2) is depressed at a projection (10) 
formed on the outer surface of one of the side walls 

thereof or when the inner case member (2) is further 
pushed into the outer casing member (1), the second 

outlet hole (7) is set in alignment with the first 
outlet hole (3) of the outer case member (1) to feed out 

the sticks through the first outlet hole (3) and the 
second outlet hole (7) one at a time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stick-shaped 
object (hereinafter referred to as stick) 
dispenser for containing sticks, such as spare leads for 
mechanical pencils or toothsticks, and, more 
particularly, to a stick dispenser for containing 
sticks, capable of surely feeding out the stick 
contained therein at a touch. A known stick dispenser for containing sticks 
comprises a case body for containing sticks, and a cap 
put on the case body so as to be removable from the case 
body or to be moved between an open position and a 
closed position. When taking out the stick from the 
stick dispenser, the cap is removed from the outlet of 
the case body. Accordingly, it is difficult to take out 
the stick surely from the stick dispenser at a touch. The applicant of the present patent 
application proposed previously a stick dispenser for 
containing sticks, capable of feeding out a desired  
 
number of sticks in Japanese Utility Model Application No. 
61-34155. This previously proposed stick dispenser 
comprises a cylindrical case body and a cap put on the case 
body. The cap is turned relative to the case body to take 
out a desired number of sticks. Since the cap must be 
turned through an angle to take out the stick, it is 
difficult to surely and readily take out the stick. Other 
forms of stick dispensers are described in EP-A-485671. In 
one, that shown in Figures 8 and 8A of EP-A-485671, a 
slidable inner member has a movable arm attached to a gate, 
movement of the arm causing the gate to be aligned with an 
orifice in an outer member so that pencil leads may pass 
through the gate and orifice. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to 
provide a stick dispenser for containing sticks, such as 
spare leads for mechanical pencils or toothsticks capable of 
surely feeding out the sticks contained therein at a touch. 
According to the invention there is provided a stick-shaped 
object dispenser for dispensing stick-shaped objects, 
comprising: 
an outer case member having an open rear end, and a 
front wall provided with a first outlet hole through which 
the stick-shaped objects are fed out one at a time; and an 
inner case member removably and slidably inserted in the 
outer case member through the open rear end of the latter, 
provided with an elongated cavity for containing the stick-shaped 
objects open to a side thereof and having a front 
wall provided with a second outlet hole through which the 
stick-shaped objects are fed out one at a time, said inner 
case member being

A stick-shaped object dispenser for dispensing 
stick-shaped objects, comprising: 


an outer case member (1) having an open rear end, and 
a front wall provided with a first outlet hole (3) through 

which the stick-shaped objects are fed out one at a time; and an inner 
case member (2) removably and slidably inserted in the outer 

case member through the open rear end of the latter, 
provided with an elongated cavity (6) for containing the 

stick-shaped objects open to a side thereof and 
having a front wall provided with a second outlet hole (7) 

through which the stick-shaped objects are fed out one at a time, said 
inner case member being removed from said outer case member 

through said open rear end in order to load a plurality of 
stick-shaped objects into said cavity; 
 
   characterised in that a front portion of a side wall bounding 

the cavity of the inner case member (2) contiguous with the 
front wall thereof is bent obliquely outward to form an 

elastically flexible tongue (9) which biases the front 
portion of the inner case member away from a side wall of 

the outer case member with which the extremity of the 
elastically flexible tongue is in contact, and the outer 

case member is provided with a positioning means (5) for 
positioning the front portion of the inner case member 

against the resilience of the elastically flexible tongue so 
that the second outlet hole (7) of the inner case member is 

set in alignment with the first outlet hole (3) of the outer 
case member upon application of a predetermined force to 

said inner case member. 
A stick-shaped object dispenser according to claim 

1, wherein the positioning means of the outer case member is 
a positioning projection (5) formed on the inner surface of 

the front wall of the outer case member.  
 
A stick-shaped object dispenser according to claim 
1, wherein a first through hole (11) is formed in a side 

wall of the outer case member, and a projection (10) is 
formed on a side wall of the inner case member, said 

projection protruding through said first through hole (11) 
when said inner case member is inserted in said outer case 

member. 
A stick-shaped object dispenser according to claim 
3, wherein the outer case member is provided with a second 

through hole (12) in one of the side walls thereof having 
a front edge and a rear edge, and the inner case member is 

provided with a stopper projection (13) on the outer surface 
of one of the side walls thereof so as to be disposed in the

engage a rear edge of the second through hole of the outer 

case member. 
A stick-shaped object dispenser according to claim 
4, wherein a slot (14) is forced in the wall of the inner 

case member on which the stopper projection is formed so as 
to extend under the stopper projection. 
A stick-shaped object dispenser according to claim 
1, wherein the inner surface of the front wall of the inner 

case member is tapered toward the second outlet hole. 
A stick-shaped object dispenser according to claim 
1, wherein the outer case member is provided with a guide 

projection (4) on the outer surface of the front wall 
thereof, the first outlet hole (3) is formed through the
