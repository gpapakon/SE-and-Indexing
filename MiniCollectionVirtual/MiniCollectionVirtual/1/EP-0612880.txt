<ABSTRACT>
A process for protecting a dyed textile fiber from 

decolorization caused by exposure to bleach, and 
improving colorfastness is provided by applying an 

aqueous solution of non-volatile, polymeric salt 
forming monomers, such as hexamethylenediamine and 

adipic acid, to the textile fiber followed by drying 
the fiber to polymerize the monomers and form a non-volatile, 

polymeric salt film thereon. The process is 
especially suitable for treating dyed polyamide fiber 

used in floor covering products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to formation of a non-volatile
polymeric salt film derived from polyamines and
polycarboxylic acids on a dyed textile fiber to prevent
color loss, especially by chemical attack from solutions of
chlorine bleach, and to improve colorfastness.Polymeric coatings have been applied to textile fibers
to solve a wide range of problems. It is well known that
melamine-formaldehyde, urea-formaldehyde, thiourea-formaldehyde
and phenyl-formaldehyde resins may be applied
to cellulosic fibers to impart anti-creasing properties,
prevent shrinking and for fixation of dyestuffs.
Additionally, these resins have been found to protect dyed
cellulose textiles from color loss when they are exposed to
chlorine solutions. In Landolt, US-A-2,373,191,
a process is disclosed for combining a dyed
fiber, such as cotton, which has been treated with one of
the aforementioned resins and cured, with a fiber, such as
wool, which is to be treated in a chlorine solution to 
prevent shrinkage. Subsequent application of a chlorine
solution to the fiber mixture should not discolor the dyed
cotton fiber. Recently, formaldehyde has been targeted as a
hazardous chemical in the work place and its use has become
severely restricted. Other drawbacks of the urea-formaldehyde
type resins include yellowing and stiffness
imparted to the treated fiber.A number of known processes are directed to providing
permanent press or anti-shrink properties to wool and blends
of wool fibers with some type of polymeric film. For
example, Intermacom A.G.'s GB-A-1,259,082
discloses in situ formation of a polyamide film on a textile
fiber. In situ film formation may be achieved by
interfacial polymerization using a diamine and diacid
chloride or diacid ester. Alternatively, a polyamide
emulsion or solution may be applied to a textile fiber and
cured, such as in Coe, US-A-2,890,097. These
processes have limited applications to the treatment of
carpet, since they tend to impart a harsh hand to the
finished product and have not been demonstrated to impart
bleach resistance to dyed textile fibers.Textile floor coverings, particularly polyamide pile
carpet, have been the focus of a variety of protective
treatments. Sulfonated phenol-formaldehyde condensation
products, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer and polymers
and copolymers of methacrylic acid have been applied to
polyamide fibers to prevent staining, and represent the 
"stain blocker" technology. Ozone protection has been
sought by coating polyamide fibers with one or more of
