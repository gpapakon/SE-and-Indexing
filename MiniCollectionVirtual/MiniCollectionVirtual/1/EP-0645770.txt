<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic disk drive an analog signal having 
symmetrical positive and negative odd levels with 

respect to a zero-level is read out of a magnetic disk 
by a head, the read analog signal is processed by an 

AGC circuit and a low pass filter, the processed analog 
signal is converted into a digital signal by an A/D 

converter (6), and the digital signal is demodulated by 
a demodulator. A zero-level setting circuit for the 

A/D converter comprises: a reference voltage generator 
(8) for the A/D converter; a zero-level error detector 

(30) between the read signal (X
n
) and the reference 
voltage (V
ref
); an accumulator (40) for accumulating 
the zero-level error from the zero-level error 

detector; and an equalizer (50) for equalizing the 
zero-level of the A/D converter to the reference 

voltage in accordance with an output signal from the 
zero-level error accumulator. As a result, the 

conversion accuracy of the A/D converter is improved 
while employing a desirably small number of bits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a zero level
setting circuit for an A/D converter in a magnetic disk
drive, and particularly, the present invention relates
to a zero level setting circuit in a signal processing
system of a magnetic disk drive for improving the
dynamic range of an A/D converter in the signal
processing system to process the read signal in a
digital state.In recent years, with the speeding up of computer
systems, external storage units such as magnetic disk
drives are required to have more speed and capacity. A
magnetic disk drive must be equipped with a demodulator
capable of handling signals of high frequency and must
have high recording density. These requirements are
factors which deteriorate the quality of signals. It
is necessary, therefore, to improve not only a system
relating to a head and a medium of the magnetic disk
drive but also the demodulator of the read signal from
the disk so that it can demodulate low-quality signals.
For this purpose, a digital demodulating system has
been proposed.The digital demodulating system employs an A/D
converter for converting an input read signal into a
digital signal. To improve conversion accuracy, the
A/D converter must employ many bits.The number of bits of the A/D converter, however,
must be as small as possible in terms of circuit scale,
power consumption, and heat generation. Accordingly,
it is required to provide an A/D converter that can
achieve maximum conversion accuracy with a small number
of bits.JP-A-5-205205 discloses zero-level setting
circuitry for use in a magnetic disk drive in which an 
analog-to-digital converter receives an analog read
signal that is produced by processing electrical
signals read from a magnetic disk and that has
substantially symmetrical positive and negative
variations in signal level relative to a zero signal
level of the said analog read signal, and in which the
converter converts the received analog read signal into
a corresponding digital signal for demodulation, the
converter having a zero level that is set in dependence
upon a reference voltage applied thereto. This zero-level
setting circuitry may be considered to comprise:
reference voltage generating means for generating the
said reference voltage; zero-level error detecting
means for producing an error signal when said zero
level of the converter differs from the said zero
signal level of the analog read signal; error signal
accumulating means for accumulating the said error
signal to produce a correction signal; and zero-level
correcting
