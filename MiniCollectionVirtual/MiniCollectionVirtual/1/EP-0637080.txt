a plurality of IGBTs are incorporated in a package, highly reliable 

pressure contact type semiconductor device having improved heat 
dissipation performance and small internal wiring inductance 

comprises a plurality of IGBTs 1 incorporated and arranged in a flat 
package 3 of a hermetically sealed structure consisting of common 

electrode plates 3a and 3b exposed to top and bottom face sides, and 
an insulating outer frame 3c interposed between the common electrode 

plates to sealingly join those electrode plates. Contact terminal

interposed between the top-face-side common electrode plate 3a and 
emitter electrodes of the respective IGBTs opposed thereto, and not 

only the emitter electrodes of the IGBTs and the common electrode 3a 
but also the collector electrodes and the bottom-face-side common 

electrode 3b are directly brought in pressure contact with each 
other. Gate electrodes of the respective IGBTs are connected to the 

exterior by being individually connected to a gate wiring conductor 6 
that is provided on an inner wall of an insulating outer frame 3c by 

gate wire leads 7.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pressure contact type
semiconductor device, such as an insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)
module, in which a plurality of semiconductor chips each having a first
main electrode (emitter) and a control electrode (gate) on one principal
surface of a substrate and a second main electrode (collector) on another
principal surface.The above-mentioned IGBT is widely applied as a power switching
device to a motor PWM control inverter etc. With the increase of the size
of semiconductor chips, the capacity of the IGBT has been further
increased. Recently, to increase the capacity, a module structure in
which a plurality of IGBTs are incorporated in a single package has been
widely adopted.In a MOS control device such as an IGBT, an emitter electrode as
a main electrode and a gate electrode as a control electrode are formed
side by side on one principal surface of a semiconductor chip. Because of
this structure, when a device is assembled by packaging an IGBT chip, a
collector on a second principal surface side can be directly mounted on a
metal base that also serves as a heat radiator. but the emitter electrode
and the gate electrode on the first principal surface side need to be
connected to the exterior separately through external lead terminals.
Therefore. in a conventional package assembly structure, in addition to
the metal base, external lead terminals for the emitter and gate are
provided on the top face of a package case. The connections between the
emitter electrode and the external lead terminal, and between the gate
electrode and the external electrode, are usually effected by wire bonding
using an aluminium wire of about 300 Âµm in diameter.EP-A-0 499 707 describes a semiconductor device wherein a
plurality of semiconductor chips each having a first main electrode and a
control electrode on a first principal surface and a second main electrode
on a second principal surface are incorporated in a flat package formed by
interposing an insulating outer frame between a pair of common electrode 
plates with the joints sealed, and wherein contact terminal bodies are
interposed between the first main electrodes of the respective
semiconductor chips and the common electrode plate of the package opposed
thereto, the control electrodes of the respective semiconductor chips are
wire-connected to a control electrode wiring conductor that is provided on
an inner periphery of the package, and an external lead terminal for the
control electrodes is led outside of the package
