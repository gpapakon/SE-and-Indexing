<ABSTRACT>
Although sodium percarbonate obtained by crystallisation processes has a high dissolving speed (rate of dissolution), it has at the same time a moderate abrasion resistance. According to the invention, the abrasion resistance can be increased by spraying the percarbonate with an aqueous sodium percarbonate solution or an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and an aqueous sodium percarbonate solution in a fluidised bed at a fluidised-bed temperature in the range from 40 to 95 DEG C. Sodium percarbonate prepared according to the invention and having an amount of shell (encapsulation layer) between 3 and 10% by weight has a high abrasion resistance with at the same time a high dissolving speed.

A process for the production of abrasion resistant
sodium percarbonate having an elevated rate of

dissolution, comprising the application of an outer
shell onto sodium percarbonate particles, which were

obtained by a crystallisation process comprising the
