<ABSTRACT>
In an opto-electronic memory system comprising a memory 
element (14), for example an optical data card, in which 

optically-encoded data is stored in rows of memory locations (17) 
and reading means (10,12) comprising a photosensitive element 

array (12) and operable to read out stored data in response to 
illumination of the memory locations, data is stored at memory 

locations as colours representing different data values and the 
memory locations are addressed with reading light of different 

colours in sequence, thereby enabling higher data storage 
capacities to be obtained. The memory locations may be 

reflective or transmissive. The reading means may comprise 
linear or two dimensional arrays of photosensitive elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an opto-electronic memory system 
comprising a memory element in which data is stored in rows of 
optically readable memory locations, electro-optical reading 
means for reading the rows of memory locations and comprising an 
array of light photosensitive elements. Examples of such systems are described in GB-A-2050663, 
GB-A-2161632 and EP-A-0509597. In these examples, information 
comprising data is stored in the memory elements in the form of 
optically differentiatable data bits of differing optical 
reflectivity or transmissivity. In GB-A-2050663 a perforated 
card type of data storage element is used whose information is 
read by feeding the card between aligned linear sets of LEDs and 
phototransistors. As the card is moved between the arrays, rows 
of data are read out with the passage of light from an individual 
LED to its associated phototransistor being determined by the 
presence or absence of an aperture in the card. In GB-A-2161632 
data is stored in an optical memory card as regions of different 
reflectivity by means of pits, spots or marks. To read this 
data, a laser beam is scanned over the card using an 
electro-mechanical drive with retro-reflected laser light being 
detected by a linear CCD array. In EP-A-0509597, data is stored 
in memory locations of an optical memory card as regions having 
different optical transmissivity formed, for example, as 
transparent and opaque regions in a photographic film. Data 
read-out is achieved using an electro-optic (liquid crystal) 
shutter arrangement and a two dimensional array of photosensitive 
elements disposed on opposite sides of the card. The shutter 
arrangement illuminates a row of memory locations at a time and 
the contents of the row are read by the photosensitive elements 
which are each linear and extend parallel to one another 
perpendicularly of the row direction. In these systems optically encoded data can be stored in the 
memory elements as bits in binary form with each bit location  
 
having two optically different states, either transmissive or 
opaque, or reflective or non-reflective, to represent digital 
logic values "1" and "0" respectively, or vice versa. Thus each 
location defines one bit of data. The data density of the memory element in these sytems is 
limited by the physical size of the photosensitive elements, at 
least in one dimension, of the light sensing component used to 
read the memory element for both linear and two-dimensional 
arrays of photosensitive elements. The
