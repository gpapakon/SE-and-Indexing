<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing a prepolymer epoxy resin mixture with oxazolidinone structures, an insoluble reaction resin powder which has no isocyanate groups and consists of an epoxy resin mixture containing a reaction accelerator and filler and having isocyanate structures, is fed to a continuously working reactor and reacted at temperatures up to 200  C, with reactor temperature at 140-190  C, and then the extruded material is cooled down to a temperature of 
<
 50  C with the aid of a cooling device mounted at the extrusion die outlet of the reactor.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a prepolymeric 
epoxy resin mixture containing oxazolidinone 

structures, characterised in that an isocyanate 
group-free, insoluble reaction resin powder 

comprising a reaction accelerator in an amount of 
0.5 to 2.5% based on epoxy resin, and filler-containing 

epoxy resin mixture containing 
isocyanurate structures is fed into a continuous 

reactor and reacted at reaction temperatures up to 
200째C, the temperature of the reactor being 140 to 

190째C, and in that the extrudate is cooled to a 
temperature of 
<
 50째C by means of a cooling device 
attached to the outlet die of the reactor. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the reaction resin powder is prepared from a 

filler-containing, heat-polymerisable reaction 
resin mixture of polyepoxy resin, comprising a 

mixture of di- and polyfunctional epoxy resins, and 
polyisocyanate resin with a molar ratio of epoxy 

groups to isocyanate groups of 
>
 1 at temperatures 
up to 180째C using substituted imidazole as reaction
 
accelerator. 
A process according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the reaction resin powder is prepared in a 

kneader or a continuous reactor. 
A process according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the epoxy resin used is a 

bisphenol A or bisphenol F epoxy resin, a phenol 
novolak or cresol novolak epoxy resin, a silicone 

epoxy resin, triglycidylisocyanurate, 
tetraglycidyldiaminodiphenylmethane or a 

polyglycidylphosphorus resin.  
 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that the molar ratio of 

polyfunctional to difunctional epoxy resin in the 
epoxy resin mixture is 0.2 to 0.75, based on epoxy 

groups. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
5, characterised in that the polyisocyanate resin 

used is an isomer mixture of 
diisocyanatodiphenylmethane or of toluene 

diisocyanate or a prepolymer of an isomer mixture 
of diisocyanatodiphenylmethane. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
6, characterised in that the reaction accelerator 

used is 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole, 2-phenylimidazole 
or 1-cyanoethyl-2-phenylimidazole. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that mineral fillers such as 

fused quartz, and/or ceramic fillers such as 
aluminium oxide are used. 
A process according to one or more of claims 1 to 
8, characterised in that the continuous reactor is 

a twin-screw extruder in which the ratio of the 
screw length to the external screw diameter is 20 

to 50, preferably 25 to 40. 
A process according to claim 9, characterised in 
that a reactor is used in which the shafts consist 

of conveying screw elements or conveying screw and 
kneading elements and the residence time of the 

material is 
<
 5 min, preferably 
<
 3 min at speeds 
of 
>
 10 min
-1
 and with minimum axial backflow.
