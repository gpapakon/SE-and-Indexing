<ABSTRACT>
An end surface polishing machine provided with one or 
more polishing units each of which consists of a jig to which a 

plurality of ferrules by which fibers are fastened are fixed, a 
mechanism for supporting the ferrule fixing jig, and a polisher 

provided with a ferrule polishing member. The end surfaces of 
the ferrules are brought into stationary contact with the upper 

surface of the polisher on which a soft material and a polishing 
sheet are pasted so as to always apply the same processing 

pressure to the end surfaces and each sample is processed so as 
to have a convex surface having a fiber as its apex, by a lapping 

motion mechanism which is capable of revolving the polisher 
orbitally and on its own axis independently of each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a polishing device which polishes the ends of optical 
fiber-fixing ferrules, including the optical fiber ends, into convex rounded 
surfaces. The problem of increased noise occurs in high-speed transmission system using 
laser diodes due to the back light reflected at the junction of optical connectors, 
that is, at the end surfaces of connected fibers. In order to reduce this reflection 
at the end surfaces, PC (physical contact) end surface formation technology, in 
which the ferrule end surface is processed into a convex rounded surface with 
the fiber at the center, and in which the end surfaces are tightly connected 
without airgap when the fibers are connected, has been widely used. In order to obtain a convex rounded surface, a polishing plate is constructed by 
gluing a thin polishing sheet onto the upper side of a flat plate made of a soft 
elastic material. The end surface of the ferrule to be polished is pressed onto 
this polishing plate while being moved in a circular arc, whereby the polishing 
disc becomes deflection due to elastic deformation, and using this bending 
phenomenon, the ferrule and fiber end surfaces are simultaneously formed into 
a precise convex rounded surface. On the other hand, because the mechanism for moving the sample and the polishing 
plate greatly affects both the accuracy of the finish of the end surface 
and the time required for the polishing, the lapping disc mechanism, which is a 
well-known device to polish parallel-flat processing objects is used for the polishing 
plate. In other words, the ferrule, which is the processing object, is kept  
 
stationary while the polishing plate simultaneously revolves and rotates by 
means of a planetary gear and a drive motor. In this way, the ferrule is placed 
in contact with the polishing plate and a lapping movement which traces a uniform 
locus is obtained. Consequently, the ferrule can be efficiently processed into a desired convex 
rounded surface with the fiber at the top. As a conventional example, U.S. patent 4979334 for an "Optical Fiber End-Face 
Polishing Device'" by M. Takahashi, filed on December 25, 1990, has been disclosed. This mechanism has an eccentric disc which revolves in a concentric circle of a 
rotating disc. This eccentric disc has a planetary gear which transmits the rotation 
of a revolution motor, and the planetary gear is connected to the polishing 
disc so that the polishing disc rotates as well as revolves. In the above mechanism, because a planetary gear is
