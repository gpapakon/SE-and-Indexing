<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the polymerization of
olefins. In a particular aspect, the present invention relates to
olefin polymerization employing a catalyst system comprising an
yttrium-containing catalyst and a chromium-containing catalyst.Various techniques have been employed in the past for the
polymerization of polymers and copolymers of olefins. One approach has
involved employing catalysts containing chromium. Typically such
polymerizations are carried out at relatively low temperatures and
pressures.For many applications, such as extrusion and molding
processes, it is highly desirable to have polymers which have a broad
molecular weight distribution. Such polymers exhibit excellent
processability, i.e., they can be processed at a faster throughput rate
with lower energy requirements with reduced melt flow perturbations. Some techniques for preparing such polymers have involved the
use of multiple reactor arrangements. Such multiple reactor schemes,
while offering versatility in resin characteristics, can be less
efficient than would be desired. Preparing the polymer in a single
reactor would be much more economical.It is also desirable to obtain a bimodal, or broad molecular
weight distribution ethylene polymer in which comonomer is incorporated
into the high molecular weight portion of the molecular weight
distribution. Such polymers exhibit good impact resistance, tensile
strength, elongation, flexural modulus, and environmental stress crack
resistance.In commercial applications, high bulk density is important for
practical considerations such as convenient transfer and handling of the
polymer. It is also important in commercial applications to be able to
produce a wide spectrum of polymers so far as melt flow is concerned,
i.e. molecular weight.It would therefore be desirable to provide a catalyst capable
of preparing polymers having high bulk density, broad molecular weight
distribution with comonomer incorporated in the high molecular weight
portion, while employing a single reactor.It is an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst
system useful for the polymerization of olefins having broad molecular
weight distribution in a single reactor.It is another object of this invention to provide a
polymerization process for preparing polymers having a broad molecular 
weight distribution which have branching in the high molecular weight
portion.It is another object of this invention to provide a polymer
having high bulk density.It is another object of this invention to provide
