<ABSTRACT>
A spring is wound on a connection terminal with 
one end thereof fixedly secured to the connection 

terminal. A spiral protuberance is formed on a bore wall 
of a holder hole and is engaged with the spring. With 

this construction, when the connection terminals are to be 
fitted together, the spring is guided by the spiral 

protuberance to be angularly displaced, and at the same 
time, the connection terminal fixed to the spring is also 

angularly displaced in synchronism therewith. Therefore, 
even if dust or the like deposits on connection terminals, 

it can be removed by the rotation of one of the connection 
terminals during the fitting operation to maintain a good 

electrical connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a connector assembly in
which dust or the like is prevented from disturbing the
electrical connection.Generally, male terminals are mounted within one of two
connector housingss that can be fitted together, and female
terminals for receiving respective male terminals are
mounted within the other connector housing. The terminals
are exposed within their respective connector housings and
usually, when the connector housings are fitted together,
these terminals are held in a fitted condition under a predetermined
contact pressure.In a condition before the connector housings are fitted
together, however, each terminal is in an exposed condition,
and therefore dust or the like sometimes deposits
on the terminals. Also, upon lapse of a long period of
time, the terminals may become oxidized, so that an oxide
film is formed on the surface of the terminal. In such a
case, there is a chance that the contact resistance increases,
and the function of the connector may be degraded.It is already known to arrange one of the terminals
within its respective connector housing such that it undergoes
a slight axial movement upon connection of the two
connector housings and thus the mating terminals, said axial
movement being against an urging force of a spring to
thereby generate the necessary contact pressure. Simultaneously
with its axial movement the terminal in question
undergoes a rotation around its longitudinal axis, said rotation
being generated by a specific mechanism for converting
the axial movement into a rotating movement. This rotating
mechanism is for example constituted by a pin running
in a spiral guide slot such that the pin and the contact
memebr connected thereto not only moves axially, but 
also rotates (US-A-4,743,201). Another approach is to use a
ball-bearing with a spiral ball track to generaste the rotational
movement (US-A-3,378,810). It also known to guide
a strip-shaped, screw-like twisted terminal inside a fixed
guide slot, so that upon axial movement the terminal is rotated
due to its twisted shape (DE-C-717 334).In all of these known approaches springs are provided
in addition to urge against the axial movement direction of
the terminal upon contact coupling in order to generate a
contact pressure.An object of the invention is to provide a connector
assembly that can overcome the problems of the prior art
and can achieve a proper electrically connected condition
notwithstanding accumulated dust or the like.To achieve the above object, the present invention provides
a

<CLAIMS>
A connector assembly comprising:

   two connectable connector housings, one (2) for accomodating
at least one fixed terminal (5) and the other (1)

for accomodating at least one movable terminal (32),
wherein said movable terminal (32) is biased by spring

means such that upon a connection of the two connector
housings and a butt connection between the fixed (5) and movable

terminals (32) the movable terminal (32) is movable in
an axial direction under compression of said spring means

and wherein furthermore means are provided for rotating the
movable terminal (32) around its longitudinal axis,

   characterized in that

   said means for rotating includes a helical groove formed in
the other connector housing (1) and the movable terminal

(32)
includes a groove follower, the

groove follower following the groove to thereby rotate the
movable terminal (32) upon movement of same in axial direction,

wherein said groove follower is a coil spring (35)
serving as said spring means, said coil spring (35) being

connected to said movable terminal (32) and having coils located
in the groove, the coils being compressed and rotated

when the movable terminal (32) contacts said fixed terminal
(5). 
The connector assembly of claim 1, further comprising
a terminal holder (28) located in said other connector

housing (1), the terminal holder (28) including a
socket (30) for rotatably receiving said movable terminal

(32).
The connector assembly of claim 1 or 2, wherein a
flange (36) is connected to the movable terminal (32) and

the coil spring (35).
The connector assembly of claim 3, wherein the coil
spring (35) includes a first coil end forming a base seat

coil (35a) that is engageable with the terminal holder (28)
and an second coil end connected to said flange (36) connected

to the movable terminal, wherein the base seat coil
(35a) is shorter than the second coil end.
The connector assembly of anyone of the preceeding
claims, wherein said one connector housing (2) has a pair

of retractable drawing plates (17), each drawing plate (17)
including a window (18) engageable with a respective projection

(16) mounted on said other connector housing (1).
The connector assembly of claim 5, further comprising
a transmission mechanism including gears (21, 22) operatively

connected to a reciprocating sector gear (20),
said sector gear (20) being operable to selectively retract

the drawing plates (17) through interaction between said
gears (21, 22) and a rack (23) formed on each of the drawing

plates (17).
The connector assembly of claim 6, wherein said
sector gear (20) is operatively connected to a lever (11)

that is pivotably operated to reciprocate the drawing
plates (17). 
The connector assembly of anyone of the preceeding
claims, wherein said other connector housing (1) includes a
