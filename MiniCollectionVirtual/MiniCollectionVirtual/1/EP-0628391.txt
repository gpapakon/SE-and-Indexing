<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing efficiently a structure of a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin having a very good appearance 
of the molded surfaces thereof and excellent mechanical property, characterized in that, in order to manufacture a structure of a 

fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin containing 5-80 % by weight of substantially parallel arranged reinforcing fibers, by impregnating 
a continuous fiber bundle with a molten thermoplastic resin while drawing the fiber bundle, a tightly set fiber bundle is 

opened by a mechanical impact and then impregnated with a molten thermoplastic resin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
process for preparing a fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin structure according to the precharacterising part 
of claim 1. A process of the above type is known from e.g. US-A-4 
588 538. It is known to incorporate reinforcement fibers 
such as glass fibers into a thermoplastic resin in 
order to improve the strength and rigidity of the 
resin. Usually a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin 
is produced by blending a thermoplastic resin with 
short fibers such as a chopped strand and extruding the 
blend on an extruder. However, the improvement in the 
mechanical strength is naturally limited, since the 
fibers used are short and, in such a short fiber-reinforced 
resin, the breakage of the fibers is 
unavoidable during the kneading in the extruder. It is 
thus impossible to satisfy the requirement of a further 
improvement in the mechanical strength. Recently, pultrusion has attracted 
attention as a  
 
process for producing a long fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin without breaking the fibers by 
overcoming the above-described defect (see the 
specifications of U.S. Patent Nos. 2877501, 4439387 and 
3022210, and the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent 
Publication-A No. 181852/1982). A further process for preparing a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic 
structure is disclosed in US-A-3 993 726. In pultrusion, an assembly of fiber bundles 
(a rove of fiber bundles), which is prepared by 
treating a lot of single-fibers from a bushing with an 
aqueous solution or aqueous emulsion of a sizing agent, 
bundling them, rolling them round a reel to form a 
cylindrical roll and drying the roll, are usually used 
as the reinforcing fibers. However, since the single-fibers 
in the fiber bundles are bound by means of the 
binder, the impregnation of the fiber bundles is 
started before they have been sufficiently opened. As 
a result, the impregnation efficiency becomes low 
and impregnation is occasionally 
insufficient thus impairing the surface appearance 
and mechanical properties. After extensive investigations made for the 
purpose of solving the above-described problem, the 
present inventors have found that the impregnation  
 
efficiency of the fiber bundle can be remarkably 
increased by opening the sized fiber bundle prior to 
the impregnation. The present invention has been 
completed on the basis of this finding. Namely, the present invention relates to a process 
for preparing a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin 
structure in which a continuous bundle of

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin structure in which a continuous 

bundle of reinforcing fibers is impregnated with a 
molten thermoplastic resin while drawing the fiber 

bundle characterized in that a continuous bundle of 
reinforcing fibers is treated with a surface treatment 

agent and is then opened by needle punching whereafter 
the bundle is impregnated with the molten thermoplastic 

resin while drawing the fiber bundle to form 
a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic resin 

structure containing 5 to 80% by weight (based on the 
whole structure) of reinforcement fibers in a state 

arranged substantially in parallel. 
A process for preparing a fiber-reinforced 
thermoplastic resin structure as set forth in claim 1, 

wherein the impregnation of the fiber bundle with a 
molten thermoplastic resin is conducted by the use of a 

crosshead die while drawing the fiber bundle.
