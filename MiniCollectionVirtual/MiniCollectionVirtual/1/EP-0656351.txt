<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dithiocarbonimide derivatives, fungicidal/insecticidal/acaricidal
agents containing the derivatives as an active ingredient, an intermediate
for use in the production of the derivatives and processes for producing the
derivatives from the intermediates.In WO 93/07116, there is described that certain kinds of oxime derivatives
are used as an active ingredient of fungicides. However, these oxime derivatives are not
necessarily suitable as an active ingredient of agricultural/horticultural fungicides.In EP-A-378 308 acrylate fungicides are disclosed.Under these circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide
a good agricultural/horticultural fungicide.That is, the present invention provides a dithiocarbonimide derivative of the
formula I:
 
wherein B is a C1-C6 alkyl group; X is an NH group and Y is a nitrogen atom, A
is a phenyl group or a heterocyclic group, both of which may be substituted with a C1-C6

group, a(C1-C6)-alkyloxycarbonyl group, a cyano group, a nitro group, a C1-C6
haloalkyl group, a C1-C6 haloalkoxy group or a methylenedioxy group which may be
substituted with a fluorine atom; or A is a C1-C20 alkyl group, a C2-C20 alkenyl group, a
C2-C20 alkynyl group, a C3-C20 cycloalkyl group, a C5-C20 cycloalkenyl group, a
C4-C20 bicycloalkyl group or a C4-C20 tricycloalkyl group, all of which may be
substituted.It is another object of the present invention to provide an agricultural/horticultural
fungicide, an insecticide and an acaricide, each of which contains a dithiocarbonimide
derivative of the formula I as an active ingredient.It is still another object of the present invention to provide processes for
producing a dithiocarbonimide of the formula I.It is still another object of the present invention to provide an intermediate of
the formula II:

wherein when X is an NH group and Y is a nitrogen atom, A is a phenyl group, a
heterocyclic group, a C1-C20 alkyl group, a C2-C20 alkenyl group, a C2-C20 alkynyl
group, a C3-C20 cycloalkyl group, a C5-C20 cycloalkenyl group, a C4-C20 bicycloalkyl
group or a C4-C20 tricycloalkyl group, all of which may be substituted. The dithiocarbonimide derivatives of the present invention are effective
