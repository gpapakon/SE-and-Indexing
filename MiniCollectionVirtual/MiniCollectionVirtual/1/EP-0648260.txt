<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for the enhanced elaboration of leukotoxin from (F. necrophorum), and subsequent production of an inactivated leukotoxoid ruminant animal vaccine against (F. necrophorum) infection and consequent liver abscesses and/or foot rot in such animals. The method involves forming a culture of (F. necrophorum) bacteria in growth media, allowing the bacteria to grow therein and to simultaneously elaborate leukotoxin in a supernate; the culturing is preferably carried out at a temperature of from about 35-41  C, a pH of from about 6.5-8, and for a period of from about 4-9 hours. At the end of the culturing, bacterial growth and leukotoxin elaboration are terminated, preferably by separating the leukotoxin supernate, whereupon the vaccine is produced by inactivation of at least the supernate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a method
of enhancing the elaboration of leukotoxin from F.
necrophorum (formerly Sphaerophorus necrophorus), in order
to facilitate the preparation of an inactivated, immunizing
vaccine against liver abscesses and/or foot rot in
ruminant animals, such as cattle and sheep. More particularly,
it is concerned with such a method, as well as
methods of producing the resultant vaccine and the vaccine
itself, wherein a culture of F. necrophorum (preferably a
biotype A strain) is grown with concomitant elaboration of
leukotoxin as a supernate under specific conditions of
temperature (preferably 35-41°C), pH (preferably 6.5-8)
and time (preferably 4-9 hours) in order to maximize
leukotoxicity. At the end of the culturing step, bacterial
growth and leukotoxin elaboration are terminated
and a vaccine is formed by inactivating at least the
leukotoxin supernate.Liver abscesses in feed lot cattle are a serious
economic problem, causing condemnation of over 3 million
livers and an estimated loss of $15 million annually in
the United States. This estimate is based primarily on
condemnation of liver and other organs, and does not
include economic losses stemming from reduced feed efficiencies
and lowered weight gains. A number of studies
have confirmed that cattle with abscessed livers gain less
(average 4-5%) and have reduced feed efficiencies (average
7%) compared with cattle having healthy livers. The 
average incidence of abscessed liver in grain-fed cattle
approximates 25-30%.F. necrophorum is the primary etiologic agent of
liver abscesses in ruminant animals. The organism has
been recognized as an animal and human pathogen since the
late 1800s, and is associated with numerous necrotic
disease conditions in domestic and wild animals. In
addition to liver abscesses, the organism is also the
primary etiologic agent of foot rot, foot abscesses, calf
diphtheria, and is frequently isolated from cases of
mastitis, metritis, and necrotic lesions of the oral
cavity.Liver abscesses in cattle are part of a disease
complex where the abscessation is secondary to primary
foci of infection in the rumen epithelium. The pathogenesis
can be summarized as follows: (1) ruminal lesions are
induced by acidosis that follows rapid change in diet from
high-roughage to high grain, prolonged feeding of high
grain diet, or occasionally by foreign body penetration of
the rumen epithelium; (2) bacteria present in the rumen
invade the epithelium and form focal abscesses in the
rumen wall; and (3)
