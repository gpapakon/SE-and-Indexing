<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a connector which can receive 
a terminal member easily and positively. In the connector, 

a retainer 10 is provided on each engaging portion 12 with a 
guide ramp face 20 which is opposed to a cavity 2 at a 

temporary locking position. A terminal member 30 is pushed 
into the cavity 2 when the retainer is at the temporary 

locking position. The member 30 does not enter into an 
opening 6 on account of the correcting action of the guide 

ramp face 20, even if the terminal member 30 is pushed 
toward the opening 6. After the distal end of the terminal 

member 30 passes over the guide ramp face 20, and outer 
periphery of the terminal member 30 is pushed down by a 

front end of the face 20. Consequently, the terminal member 
30 is prevented from entering into the opening 6 and moves 

in the proper passage.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector in which a
terminal member is brought into a dual locking state by a
first locking means in a cavity in a connector housing and
a second locking means on a retainer.Heretofore, such connector comprised a connector
housing provided in its interior with a plurality of
cavities and in its exterior with a plurality of openings
which are communicated with the cavities respectively, a
plurality of terminal members each of which is inserted into
a plurality of first locking means such as elastic locking
pieces and the like each of which is disposed in each
cavity, and a retainer mounted on the opening.Upon attaching the terminal member to the connector,
the terminal member is inserted into the cavity in the
connector housing on which the retainer is not mounted and
the first locking means in the cavity holds the terminal
member in a first locking state. Thereafter, the retainer
is mounted on the openings so that the projections on the
retainer engage with the terminal member, thereby holding it
in a second locking state. Thus, the terminal member is
brought into a dual locking state and is positively locked
in the cavity so as not to come out of it.In such a conventional connector, since the retainer
is not mounted on the opening upon insertion of the terminal
member, an inner wall of the cavity is cut off around the
opening.Consequently, in the case where the terminal member
is inserted into the cavity while it is inclined, the
terminal member may be advanced toward the opening out of a
proper insertion passage and may strike on an inner wall of
the opening. In such cases, it is necessary to try the
insertion procedure again.In such circumstances an automatic process is engaged
by using a device for inserting the terminal member into the 
cavity and are also of a manual process. Thus, it is necessary to set the
position and the direction of the terminal member at a high accuracy and a
skilled workperson is required in order to carry out the insertion work of
the terminal member precisely and effectively.A connector is disclosed in US-A-5 145 419, used as the basis of
the pre-characterising portion of claim 1, comprises a housing and a
retainer which can be mounted in a temporary position to allow insertion
and withdrawal of terminals from the housing, and a locking position in
which each terminal is locked.An object of the present invention is to provide a connector which
can carry out an insertion of the terminal member precisely and
effectively even if the position and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A connector comprising a housing (1) provided in its interior with a

plurality of cavities (2) having an opening (6) at one end, each cavity being
adapted to receive a terminal member (30), and a retainer (10) adapted to be

mounted on said openings (6) and moveable between a temporary locking
position in which terminals (10) can be inserted into and withdrawn from said

cavities (2) and a regular locking position whereby each terminal member (30) in
said cavities (2) is retained by a first engaging means in said cavity (2) and a

second engaging means on the retainer (10),

   characterised in that the first engaging means comprises a first
engaging element (4) provided in each cavity (2) having an end projection (5)

adapted to engage an opening (31) in each terminal (30), the retainer (10)
comprises at least first and second opposite side plates (13) each provided

with an elongate slot (14) and second engaging means comprising a
plurality of engaging portions (12) provided between the side plates (13),

each of the engaging portions (12) having a guide face (20) parallel to and
complementary to the elongated slots (14), and the housing (1) is provided

with a ramp face (7) and with a guide boss (15) provided on each side of the
housing (1) slanting parallel to the ramp face (7) which co-operates with the

slots (14) on the retainer (10),

   in which the guide face (20) on the retainer (10) guides the terminals (30)
on entering the cavities (2) when the retainer (10) is in the temporary locking

position, and said engaging portions (12) lock said retainer (10) in said
regular locking position.
A connector according to claim 1, wherein said retainer (10) is
united to said connector housing (1) through a flexible hinge (11). 
A connector according to claim 1, wherein said retainer (10) is
separated from said connector housing (1).
