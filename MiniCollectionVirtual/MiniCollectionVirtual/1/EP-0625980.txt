 PROCESS FOR PREPARING CHIRALETHYL (5-AMINO-l,2-DIHYDRO-2-METHYL-3-PHENYLPYRIDO[3, -b]PYRAZIN-7-YL) CARBAMATEFIELD OF INVENTIONThe present invention relates to a novel chemical process for the preparation of chiral ethyl (5-amino- 1,2-dihydro-2-methyl-3-phenylpyrido [3, 4-b]pyrazin-7- yl)carbamate and novel intermediates utilized in said chemical synthesis.BACKGROUND OF INVENTIONThe novel process of the present invention constitutes a markedly improved process for preparing compounds described in U.S. Patent 4,866,059, issued September 12, 1989. The process results in the synthesis of the (S)-(-)- and the (R) -(+) -isomers of ethyl (5-amino-l,2-dihydro-2-methyl-3-phenylpyrido- [3, 4-b]pyrazin-7-yl) carbamate, which is a known anticancer agent. The present process avoids the need to utilize the chromium trioxide oxidation step described in U.S. 4,866,059, and thus provides a superior process.SUMMARY OF INVENTIONThe novel process of the present invention is set forth in the following reaction scheme. 

 REACTION SCHEME IH 
(la) (2a)(5a)P MgXIn the above reaction scheme the * is used to designate that the configuration at the carbon atom is either (S) -(-)- or (R)-(+) . The compounds designated by formula (5) are novel compounds and are a part of this invention. These compounds are further depicted by the following Formulas I and II :I IIDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTIONIn the above reaction scheme and in formulas I and II, R and Rι mean lower alkyl of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, i.e., methyl, ethyl, iv-propyl or n-butyl. Preferably, each of R and R1 is methyl. In the reaction scheme in the compounds of formulas (la) and (2a) PG represents a protecting group and can be carbobenzyloxy(phenylmethoxycarbonyl) , benzhydryloxy- carbonyl, or tert-butoxycarbonyl. The preferred protecting group is carbobenzyloxy. The chiral protected alanine of formula (la) is treated with a tertiary alkyl amine and a lower alkyl chloroformate in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or diethylether, followed by treatment with a di (lower) alkyIhydroxylamine in chloroform or dichlorome hane. The hydroxylamine has the formula R HOR2 wherein each of R and .-^ is a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The lower alkyl chloroformate can have an alkyl group which is 

straight or branched having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms with methyl being preferred. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of from -25°C to +25°C with the preferred temperature being -10°C. The lower alkyl tertiary amine can be, e.g.,
