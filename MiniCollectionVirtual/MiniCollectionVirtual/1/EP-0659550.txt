<ABSTRACT>
Gas-tight, chemically resistant protective clothing is made from a film-coated non-woven fabric (1) which is reinforced with woven or knitted fabric (2) made from polyester, polyamide, aramid or polypropylene microfibres, and is capillary active on the body side (8). The film coating (11) is a composite contg. at least 5 layers (3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Pref. fabric (1) is reinforced with woven or knitted fabric (2) made from polymer fibre yarn (polymers as above), and has a water absorption of more than 150%. Film coating (11) consists of layers of polyethylene (3), adhesive (4), EVOH (5), adhesive (6) and polyethylene (7) (from the outside to the inside), each layer having a thickness of 5-100~m. The PE layer (7) in contact with fabric (1) also contains 0.1-10% EVA. Fabric (1) may be coated with two superimposed layers of film (11).

Gas-impermeable protective clothing which is resistant to
chemicals and is produced from a non-woven fabric (1) coated with

a film (11) consisting of at least five layers (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) in
a composite, characterised in that the non-woven fabric (1) is

formed as binder-free needle-bonded fabric, is reinforced by
weaving or knitting (2) and consists of polyester, polyamide,

aramide or polypropylene microfibres.
Protective clothing according to claim 1, characterised in
that the non-woven fabric (1) is reinforced with a woven or

knitted fabric (2) consisting of polyester, polyamide, aramide or
polypropylene yarn.
Protective clothing according to at least one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the non-woven fabric (10)

has a water absorption capacity higher than 150%.
Protective clothing according to at least one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the film coating (11)

consists, in sequence from the outside to the inside, of a
polyethylene layer (3), an adhesion promoter (4), an EVOH layer
