<ABSTRACT>
The object is to provide a thermoplastic multilayer composite of polyamide (nylon) and polyvinylidene fluoride having strong interlayer adhesion and improved resistance to chemical agents, for example methanol-containing fuel, without impairment of the typical service properties of polyamide and polyvinylidene fluoride by the measures necessary to achieve the interlayer adhesion. This is achieved by     I. at least one layer based on a polyamide moulding composition, II. at least one layer, adjacent to I, based on a moulding composition comprising a mixture of       a) polyvinylidene fluoride   b) polyglutarimide,  where the layers are adhesively bonded to one another. The invention enables thermoplastic multilayer composites having the desired improved property profile to be obtained.
