<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide photographic emulsion is provided, 
wherein the silver halide emulsion contains silver halide 

grains having an average iodide content of less than 3 mol%, 
the silver halide grains comprising monodispersed core/shell 

type silver halide grains containing internally high iodide, 
the core/shell grains having two parallel twin planes and a 

substantially roundish hexahedral or tetradecahedral form.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide photographic 
emulsion, the process of the preparation thereof, a silver 
halide photographic light-sensitive material applied with the 
above-mentioned emulsion including, especially, a silver 
halide photographic light-sensitive material for medical use 
and the processing method thereof, and, particularly, to a 
silver halide photographic emulsion high in sensitivity and 
improved in aging preservation and development progress, the 
process of the preparation thereof, a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material applied with the above-mentioned 
emulsion including, especially, a silver halide 
photographic light-sensitive material for medical use and the 
processing method thereof. In recent years, there have been serious demands for 
silver halide photographic light-sensitive material  
 
(hereinafter sometimes referred simply to as a light-sensitive 
material) higher in sensitivity and image-quality higher and 
more stabilized in photographically aging characteristics, and 
various improvements of the techniques mainly of silver halide 
emulsions have been studied. On the other hand, in the steps for developing a silver 
halide photographic light-sensitive material, a high-temperature 
and high-speed process has been rapidly 
popularized. Also when processing various kinds of silver 
halide photographic light-sensitive materials by making use of 
an automatic processor, the processing time has been 
shortened. For achieving a rapid processing, it has been 
demanded to obtain a satisfactory sensitivity and contrast 
gradation within a short time. About the improvements in the color reproducibility of a 
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material, 
Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection 
(hereinafter referred to as JP OPI Publication) No. 3-168734/1991 
describes a monodisperse type silver halide 
twinned crystal emulsion having a ratio of a grain-size / a 
grain-thickness of less than 5, wherein, however, any roundish 
grain configuration after the grain is grown up is not 
described at all. JP Examined Publication No. 4-33019/1992 describes a 
normal crystal emulsion in which silver iodide is localized 
inside thereof and the grains thereof are made roundish in  
 
configuration, wherein, however, a pressure-resistance 
improvement is mainly described, but any aging preservability 
(including, for example, any preservability under the 
conditions of a high humidity) is not described at all. 
Therefore, any more

<CLAIMS>
A silver halide photographic emulsion, wherein said 
silver halide emulsion contains silver halide grains having an 

average iodide content of less than 3 mol%, said silver halide 
grains comprising monodispersed core/shell type silver halide 

grains having two twin planes parallel to each other and said 
core/shell type grains being substantially roundish hexahedral 

or tetradecahedral crystals. 
The silver halide emulsion of claim 1, wherein said 
core/shell grains comprise an internal high iodide-containing 

region and an outermost surface layer, the internal region 
containing an iodide content higher than that of the outermost 

surface layer. 
The silver halide emulsion of claim 2, wherein said 
surface layer contains 10 mol% or less iodide. 
The silver halide emulsion of claim 1, wherein said 
core/shell grains exhibit roundness at the corners of crystal 

faces, a radius of curvature of the roundness being within the 
range of r/10 to r/2, wherein r is a length of the longest 

side in a polygon having the largest area among polygons which 
are supposedly formed by extending sides of each of outer 

faces of the hexahedral or tetradecahedral crystal. 
The silver halide emulsion of claim 1, wherein said 
silver halide grains account for 50% of total grains by 

number. 
The silver halide emulsion of claim 1, wherein said 
silver halide emulsion is chemically-sensitized in the 

presence of a selenium compound or a tellurium compound.
