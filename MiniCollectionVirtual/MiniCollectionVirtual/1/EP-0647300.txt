<ABSTRACT>
A dual lip shaft seal includes two sealing disks (49-50) bonded directly to a radial wall (41) of an annular metal case (37). The radial wall (41) has an annular step (43), such that two separate mounting surfaces (45-47) are formed for mounting the two disks (49-50). Each sealing disk (49-50) is preferably formed of PTFE and heat-bonded to its respective mounting surface (45-47) by an induction heater coil (53) disposed in confronting relation to the radial wall (41) of the metal case (37).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to shaft 
seals of the dual lip radial type and in particular 
to a shaft seal having a first annular sealing disk 
engageable with a shaft surface for sealing and 
retaining lubricant and a second annular sealing 
disk for preventing dirt and other contaminants 
from migrating along the shaft surface to the first 
sealing disk and into the lubricant. Dual lip radial seals are well known in the 
art. In one known arrangement, such a seal 
includes an outer metal case having a cylindrical 
wall and a radial wall. An annular gasket is 
seated on the radial wall for engagement with a 
dirt excluder lip or disk. A second seal disk or 
lip is clamped against the dirt excluder disk by an 
inner metal case that is nested within the outer 
metal case. The inner metal case has a radial wall 
for applying a squeezing pressure on the second 
seal disk such that the two disks are mechanically 
retained in the metal case structure.  
 The two disks may be formed of polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE). An advantage of this design 
is that one disk may be filled with one type of 
filler material such as glass for abrasion 
resistance, and the other disk may be filled with 
another type of filler material such as molybdenum 
disulphide for reducing running friction. A 
drawback associated with this design is its 
relatively high cost due to its numerous components 
and involved manufacturing method. Another known arrangement is shown in French 
Patent FR-A-2 559 231 which discloses a seal having 
one lip formed of polytetrafluoroethylene and a 
second lip formed of elastomeric material. Each 
lip is mounted to a seal casing which is formed 
with axial steps. One lip is mounted to one 
stepped portion and the other lip is mounted to 
another stepped portion. In another known arrangement, a relatively 
thick PTFE disk is bonded to an inwardly radiating 
wall portion of a metal case. The relatively thick 
disk has a radial slit extending from its inner 
edge partway toward its outer edge, such that two 
annular sealing disks or lips are formed by a 
single slit disk. The sealing disks are arranged 
in opposite axial directions on ashaft. surface, 
whereby one of the sealing disks constitutes a dirt 
excluder seal and the other disk constitutes an oil 
seal. An advantage of this design is its low cost 
due to its simplicity of design and ease of 
manufacture. However, it is most difficult to 
provide separate fillers in the two seal lips in an 
economical fashion.  
 Accordingly, a need exists

<CLAIMS>
A dual lip seal, comprising : 

an annular case (37) that includes a radial wall (41) 
having an axial step (43) defining a radially outer mounting 

surface (47) and a radially inner mounting surface (45) 
respectively located in first and second axially-spaced 

radially-extending planes; 
a first sealing disk (49) seated on said inner mounting 
surface (45); and 
a second sealing disk (50) seated on said outer mounting 
surface (47) such that said second disk (50) extends radially 

outwardly beyond said axial step (43); 
 
   characterised in that
 
   said disks (49, 50) are bonded to their respective 

mounting surfaces, and said axial step (43) having a thickness 
less than the thickness of said first sealing disk (49), and 

said second disk being engageable with said first disk during 
bonding. 
The dual lip seal of claim 1, wherein each sealing disk 
(49, 50) is formed of PTFE. 
The dual lip seal of claim 2, wherein said first sealing 
disk (49) comprises a first filler dispersed therein, and said 

second sealing disk (50) comprises a second filler dispersed 
therein. 
The dual lip seal of claim 2, wherein said first and 
second sealing disks (49, 50) each comprise finely divided filler 

materials dispersed therein, the filler materials in the first 
disk being different than the filler materials in the second 

disk. 
The dual lip seal of claim 2, wherein said second sealing 
disk (50) is constructed so that, in use, a 

surface portion thereof is in facial contact with said first  
 

sealing disks (49). 
The dual lip seal of claim 2, wherein each sealing disk (49, 50) 
has the same thickness. 
A method of forming a dual lip seal, comprising : 

forming an annular case (37) to include a radial wall 
(41) having an annular step (43) formed therein, whereby said 

radial wall provides an outer annular mounting surface (47) 
and an inner annular mounting surface (45) located in axially-spaced, 

axially-extending planes; and 
placing a first annular sealing disk (49) against said 
inner mounting surface (45), said first annular sealing disk 

having a thickness greater than the thickness of said annular 
step; 
placing a second annular sealing disk (50) against said 
outer mounting surface (47); 
positioning an induction coil (53) adjacent said radial 
wall (41); and 
energizing said induction coil (53), whereby a magnetic 
field is generated and passed through the radial wall (41) 

such that the radial wall (41) is heated to achieve an 
adhesive bond between the radial wall and both sealing disks 

(49, 50) and pressure is applied to said second annular 
sealing disk (50) as said radial wall (41) is heated such that 

said first annular sealing disk (49) is slightly compressed 
between said inner annular mounting surface (45) and said 

second annular sealing disk (50). 
The method of claim 7. wherein each sealing disk is 
formed of PTFE.
