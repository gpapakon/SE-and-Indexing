boards (1, 2) are braced parallel to each other, at a distance corresponding to the 

thickness of the concrete wall to be erected, by means of bracing anchors (3) having 
tubular spreaders (4, 40), the bracing anchors are removed from the erected hardened

concrete and the shuttering boards are taken down, after which the tubular spreaders 

remaining in the concrete wall are filled with grout in order to seal the bracing points,

open on the underside, and grouting material is pressed by means of a hose or pipe into 
hollow spaces and/or cracks between the concrete wall and the concrete foundation and 

the grouting channel and the concrete wall after the concrete wall has been erected,
 
characterised in that

into a sealing device (43) via a conduit through an opening in the casing of the tubular 

spreader (40). 
A tubular spreader for an anchor for a shuttering system for the erection of a concrete 
wall for use in processes according to one or more of claims 1 to 17,
 
characterised in that
 
there is at least one hole (11) in the casing (18) which is covered to prevent fluid 

concrete from passing through it during casting into the intermediate space between the 
shuttering boards.
