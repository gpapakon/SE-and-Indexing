<ABSTRACT>
A process of applying a finish to an electrically conductive vehicle body by 
passing the body through a water-based electrocoating bath while applying a 

voltage between the body and the bath to electro-coat the body with constituents 
of the bath. The coat is dehydrated to a state of sufficient dryness to permit spray 

application of a water-base primer while maintaining the coat cool enough to 
avoid fusing the coat. A coating of water-base primer is then sprayed over the 

dehydrated but otherwise untreated E coat. The coat and coating are then baked 
to concurrently fuse both of them. The primer sprayed on an interior portion of 

the body is pigmented to a desired finished colour. Selected portions of the baked 
coating on the exterior of the body are light sanded to remove entrained dirt and 

thereafter finish coating is applied to the body.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of applying protective coatings to metal 
substrates, and more particularly, to a process which is especially suited for applying 
protective coatings to vehicle bodies, and products of the process. Present day, over the highway, trucks and tractors such as the large Class A 
highway tractors, typically have forwardly, tilting unitized hood and fender assemblies 
that are made from composites. While the hood and fender assemblies 
are composites, the truck bodies usually continue to be sheet metal fabrications of 
aluminum and/or galvanized steel. An over-the-highway tractor is typically operated for at least 500,000 miles 
during its life. Often, such trucks and tractors are operated for extended periods 
without washing. They are frequently subjected to attack by corrosive solutions 
such as water and slush bearing road salt during snowy conditions and ocean spray. 
If a vehicle manufacturer is to remain competitive, it is essential that a vehicle 
body be protected with coatings that provide outstanding corrosion resistance. It has now become conventional to immerse a vehicle body in a tank of a 
base coating finish and deposit a protective base coating through an electrocoating 
process. Once coated, the body is baked to provide a fused, base coating typically 
referred to as an E coat. The E coat is sanded and a primer surfacer is then 
spray-applied over the E coat. The body is again baked to fuse the primer 
surfacer. After the primer surfacer has been baked, the body is again sanded to 
prepare the body for a finish coating. While reasonably good corrosion resistance has been provided with the 
described process, it is costly both because of the high power requirements for the 
two baking operations prior to finish coating, and labor intensive because of the 
required two sandings of the entire body.  
 US 4619764 discloses a process of coating a substrate by 
electrophoretically applying a base coat to the substrate, drying 
the base coat to a partial cure stage, short of complete cure and 
then non-electrophoretically applying a top coat comprising 
isocyanate curing agents, and then curing the substrate by baking 
to effect complete cure of the coatings to provide a multilayered 
coating of the substrate. The object of this prior art invention 
is to avoid the intermixing of the top coat with the base coat 
whilst still using the so called wet-on-wet procedure.  
 It is an object of the present invention to obviate or 
mitigate one or more disadvantages of

<CLAIMS>
A process of applying a finish to an electrically 
conductive vehicle body comprising passing the body through a 

water-based electrocoating bath while applying a voltage between 
the body and the bath to coat the body with constituents of the 

bath; characterized by: 

dehydrating the coat to a state of sufficient dryness to 
permit spray application of a water-base primer while maintaining 

the coat cool enough to avoid fusing the coat; 
spraying a coating of water-base primer over the coat; and 
baking the coat and coating for a time long enough and at a 
temperature high enough to fuse the coat and coating into a 

unitary smooth finish. 
The process of Claim 1 characterized in that primer sprayed 
on an interior portion of the body is pigmented to a desired 

finished colour. 
The process of either Claim 1 or Claim 2 characterized in 
that the priming step is performed without processing of the coat 

other than the dehydration step. 
The process of any of the preceding claims characterized in 
that the dehydration step is performed in an oven operated at 

from 65°C to 94°C (150°F to 200°F) and the body is maintained in 
the oven from 20 to 30 minutes. 
The process of any of the preceding claims characterized in 
that the baking step comprises placing the body in an oven for 

about 30 minutes while maintaining the oven at about 182°C to 
191°C (360-375°F). 
The process of any of the preceding claims, characterized 
by further including the step of light sanding selected portions 

of the baked coating to remove entrained dirt and thereafter  
 

finish coating the body. 
The process of any of the preceding claims characterized in 
that the baking step comprises heating the body to about 154°C 

(310°F) for about 10 minutes or longer. 
The process of any of the preceding claims characterized in 
that the dehydrating step yields a body temperature of from 46°C 

(115°F) to 52°C (125°F). 
The process of any of the preceding claims characterized in 
that the coat is from 0.016mm to 0.028mm (.66 mil to 1.1 mil) in 

thickness and the coating is from 0.0076mm to 0.02mm (0.3 mil to 
0.8 mil) in thickness.
