<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a melt transesterification 
process for the production of polycarbonates. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a melt 
transesterification process of reacting a bis(aryl)carbonate 
and a dihydric phenol in the presence of a heterocyclic borate 
salt catalyst. The conventional method for the production of 
polycarbonates is an interfacial polymerization route 
employing phosgene as a raw material. Because of its toxicity 
and difficulties in transportation, phosgene causes 
considerable safety problems. It is usually manufactured 
on-site in a dedicated plant and transferred by pipeline to 
the vessel where it is to be used. Toxicity considerations 
notwithstanding, when phosgene is used, chlorine, obtained as 
a by-product, is converted to sodium chloride, the disposal of 
which presents ecological problems. Thus, considerable effort has been devoted to replacing 
phosgene in polycarbonate manufacturing. A non-phosgene route 
of particular interest involves the production of dimethyl 
carbonate (DMC) by oxidative carbonylation of methanol with  
 
carbon monoxide and oxygen (US 4,218,391, US 4,318,862 and US 
3,963,586). The DMC is converted to a bis(aryl)carbonate by 
reaction with the corresponding phenol. For instance, 
diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is obtained by reaction of DMC with 
phenol (US 4,554,110 and US 4,410,464). The preparation of aromatic polycarbonates from a 
bis(aryl)carbonate and a dihydric phenol, such as bisphenol-A 
(BPA), is performed by means of a transesterification process, 
which takes place in the melted state in the presence of a 
catalyst. In US 4,330,664, hydrides of aluminum or boron are 
used for this purpose; particularly preferred are 
tetramethylammonium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride. 
Japanese Application 62-158719 describes the preparation of 
polycarbonate by a transesterification route in the presence 
of KBH₄ as catalyst. In an alternative method, Japanese 
Application 62-169821 discloses a process in which a 
quaternary ammonium borohydride compound of formula R'₄NBH₄ is 
employed, where R' is a C₁-C₄ alkyl, a C₆-C₁₀ aryl or a C₆-C₁₀ 
arylalkyl group. It has now been discovered that it is possible to achieve 
a much faster rate and completion of the melt polycarbonate 
transesterification by using heterocyclic borate salts as 
catalysts. As a consequence, it is possible to produce 
polycarbonates endowed with particularly high molecular 
weights. Moreover, the heterocyclic borate salts offer other 
advantages,
