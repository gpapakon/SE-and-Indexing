<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a method of controlling the handling of a vehicle, the method calling for at least the vehicle weight (G) and the instantaneous location of the centre of gravity (SP) to be determined from tyre-sensor signals. In a further embodiment, the invention calls for the use of a weight-distribution model which includes as its basic data the basic weight distribution of the vehicle, i.e. weights which are always the same, even at different loads. In addition, variable weights, such as those of the passengers, the luggage, etc., and their location are determined by means of the tyre-sensor signals and incorporated in the weight-distribution model as a variable weight distribution. Knowing all such data, parameters characteristic of the dynamics of the vehicle's motion can be determined, thus enabling vehicle yaw rate and slip angle to be determined by suitable calculations without being dependent on the signals from a yaw-rate sensor or a lateral-acceleration sensor.

<CLAIMS>
A process for controlling the driving behavior of an
automotive vehicle provided with tire sensors (3) for

determining the forces (F
mess
) applied to the vehicle tires,
wherein by way of a memorized mass distribution model (1)

which contains the basic mass distribution of the vehicle,
the actual vehicle mass, the momentary location of the mass

point of gravity, a variable mass distribution (SP) of the
vehicle and values of the vehicle dynamics (Ψ ˙, β) are

calculated from the measured tire forces (G
1
 through G
4
), and
the variable mass distribution is so determined that the

mass distribution model for the basic mass distribution adds
mass to typical loading sites.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
masses, at the typical loading sites, in the mass

distribution model, are approximated as points of mass.
A process according to claim 2, characterized in that such
points of mass are provided at the typical locations of the

points of gravity of driver, passengers, luggage compartment
load and/or of the roof load.
A process according to any one of claims 1 through 3,
characterized in that the mass at least at one loading site

is applied as a body of finite expansion.
A process according to any one of claims 2 to 4,
characterized in that at least the yaw speed (Ψ ˙) or the side

slip angle (β) or a time-related derivative thereof is
calculated from the mass distribution model (1). 
A process according to claim 5, characterized in that only
the actual driving behavior of the automotive vehicle (2) is

determined from the mass distribution model (1) while the
nominal driving behavior is calculated from a linear one-track

model.
