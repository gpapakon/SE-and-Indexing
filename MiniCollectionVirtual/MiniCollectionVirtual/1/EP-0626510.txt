<ABSTRACT>
A system and method of operating a system 
comprising an air separation plant (10) and a gas turbine 

engine (18), the method comprising: providing a 
nitrogen-rich stream (16) from the air separation plant (10); 

expanding and thereby cooling the nitrogen-rich stream (16); 
and delivering the expanded stream to the inlet of the 

compressor of the gas turbine engine (18) to combine with 
the air stream (34) entering the inlet of the compressor (20) to 

form a total feed stream with reduced temperature and 
oxygen content so as to increase power output, increase 

efficiency and reduce NOx emissions of the gas turbine (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
Gas turbine engines are used as power plants in 
many industries, such as aviation, gas pipeline 
transmission, petroleum, steel, marine, and electric 
utilities. For many stationary and mobile 
applications, their characteristics have proved 
superior to those of competitive power plants. With 
ubiquitous use of gas turbine engines, even small 
increases in their efficiency and power output are 
highly desirable and needed. Accordingly, gas turbine 
engines have been combined with steam turbines in 
various ways in combined steam and gas plants. To achieve increased efficiency, gas turbines 
engines have been used also in coal gasification 
plants, versions of which are basically comprised of an 
air separation unit and a coal gas production unit. In 
the air separation unit, an oxygen-enriched stream is 
produced. In the coal gas production unit, the 
oxygen-enriched stream is used to partially oxidize 
coal to generate a fuel gas. The fuel gas is used as 
fuel in a gas turbine engine. Even small further 
increases in efficiency and power output of such plants 
are highly desirable. This invention satisfies the above and other needs 
which will become apparent by providing a system 
advantageously combining a gas turbine engine and air 
separation plant. In one embodiment the system 
comprises: 
(a) a gas turbine engine having a compressor and 
a combustor; (b) an air separation plant capable of producing  
 
at least one nitrogen-rich fluid stream; (c) an expander for expanding and thereby cooling 
at least a portion of the nitrogen-rich stream after 
withdrawal from the air separation plant; and (d) conduit for delivering the expanded portion of 
the nitrogen-rich stream from the expander to the inlet 
of the compressor of the gas turbine engine. In another embodiment, the system further 
comprises a second compressor for compressing the 
nitrogen-rich stream after withdrawal from the air 
separation plant and cooling means for cooling the 
compressed nitrogen-steam prior to expansion in the 
expander. The invention also provides a novel method of 
operating a system combining a gas turbine engine and 
air separation plant. The method comprises the steps 
of: 
(a) producing at least one nitrogen-rich stream 
from the air separation plant; (b) expanding at least a portion of the nitrogen-rich 
stream after withdrawal from the air separation 
plant; and (c) delivering the expanded portion of the 
nitrogen-rich stream to the inlet of the compressor of 
the gas turbine engine. In another embodiment, the
