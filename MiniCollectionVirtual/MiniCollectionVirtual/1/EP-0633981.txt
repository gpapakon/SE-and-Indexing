<ABSTRACT>
An easy-to-produce oil pump for small motors has an eccentric rod (1) coupled to the crankshaft. The free end of the eccentric rod (1) carries a piston plate (3) which cooperates with a cylinder pot (2) submerged in the oil and open towards the eccentric rod (1), so that the pressurized oil is supplied through an oil channel (5) arranged in the eccentric rod (1) to one or several lubrication spots. The piston plate tolerates the oscillation of the eccentric rod (1).

Oil pump for an engine of the reciprocating piston type, 
with at least one piston/cylinder arrangement, whereof the piston 

drives the crank shaft by way of a connecting rod, the oil pump 
comprising an eccentric rod (1) connected to the crank shaft, the 

free end of which rod supports a piston, which cooperates with 
a cylinder cup (2) located below oil and open towards the 

eccentric rod (1), so that the pressure oil is supplied through 
an oil passage (5) in the eccentric rod (1) to one or more 

lubricating points, characterised in that the piston is formed 
by a piston plate (3), which is mounted loosely and with axial 

play between axial abutments at the end of the eccentric rod (1) 
adjacent the cylinder and depending on the stroke direction 

cooperates with the abutments as a suction or pressure valve. 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
formed on the eccentric rod (1) is a sliding bearing ring (14) 

with a bearing bore (15) for the eccentric shaft section serving 
as a bearing seat on the crank shaft. 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
piston plate (3) is mounted to float on a neck part (9) 

projecting axially at the end of the eccentric rod (1) remote 
from the crank shaft. 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
abutment adjacent the crank shaft is constructed as an annular 

collar (11) of the eccentric rod (1) with a contact surface (12) 
for the piston plate (3) during the delivery stroke of the oil 

pump. 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
abutment remote from the crank shaft is formed by the head (10) 

of a hollow screw (4), which is screwed into the front end of the 
eccentric rod (1) remote from the crank shaft so that the rear 

side of the head (10) of the hollow screw (4) forms a support  
 

surface (13) for the piston plate (3) during the suction stroke 
of the oil pump. 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
piston plate (3) comprises through-holes (17), which are closed 

during the delivery stroke by the collar (11), so that the 
pressure oil passes by way of radial openings in the neck part 

(9) and in the shaft (17) of the hollow screw (4) into the oil 
passage (5). 
Oil pump according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
through-holes (17) are open during the suction stroke, the piston 

plate (3) resting on the rear side of the head (10) of the hollow 
screw (4) and consequently closing the radial openings in the 

neck part (9) leading to the oil passage (5). 
Oil pump according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
radial openings in the neck part (9) are formed by slots (20) in 

its end face. 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
piston plate (3) has a spherical peripheral surface (16). 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
piston plate (3) is divided parallel to the plane of the plate 

and the two plate parts (3a, 3b) together form a peripheral 
groove (30) open towards the outside, in which a gasket (31) is 

inserted loosely and with radial play, which bears by its 
peripheral surface in a sealing manner on the inner wall of the 

cylinder cup (2). 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
piston plate (3) comprises a peripheral groove (30) for receiving 

a piston ring (32) having a sealing action with respect to the 
cylinder cup (2). 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that a  
 

peripheral section of the piston plate (3) is formed by an 
annular lip (33) of elastomeric material. 
Oil pump according to Claim 12, characterised in that the 
annular lip (33) is connected to the piston plate (3) by 

vulcanization. 
Oil pump according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
bearing bore (15) in the sliding bearing ring (14) of the 

eccentric rod (1) comprises an annular groove (22), which serves 
to lubricate the bearing and is connected by way of an oil bore 

to the connecting rod bearing of the crank shaft. 
Oil pump according to Claim 14, characterised in that 
connected to the annular groove (22) is an injection nozzle (27) 

for the cooling of the piston base of the piston of the engine 
of the reciprocating piston type.
