<ABSTRACT>
A system (10) for controlling the validity of 
printing of indicias on mailpieces from a potentially 

large number of users of postage meters (12) includes 
apparatus disposed in each said postage meter for 

generating a code and for printing the code on each 
mailpiece. The code is an encrypted code representative 

of the postage meter apparatus printing the indicia and 
other information uniquely determinative of the 

legitimacy of postage on the mailpieces. The keys (40, 
42) for the code generating apparatus are changed to 

change its code generation at predetermined time 
intervals in each of the meters (12). A security center 

(16) includes apparatus for maintaining a security code 
database (30) and for keeping track of the keys for 

generating security codes in correspondence with the 

changes in each generating apparatus and the information 
printed on the mailpiece by the postage meter apparatus 

(12) for comparison with the code printed on the 
mailpiece. There may be two codes printed, one used by 

the Postal Service for its security checks and one by the 
manufacturer (22). The encryption key may be changed at 

predetermined intervals or on a daily basis or for 
printing each mailpiece.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems for controlling the
validity of printing indicia on mailpieces and is
applicable to mail processing systems and more
particularly to the security of postage metering systems.Digital printing technology has enabled mailers to
implement digital, e.g., bit map addressable, printing in
a convenient manner. It has been found to be desirable
to use such techniques for the purpose of evidencing
payment of postage. The computer driven printer can
print, for example, a postal indicia in a desired
location on the face of a mail piece.Where it is necessary herein to distinguish such
postage-meter-like devices from a typical postage meter,
such devices will be called herein Postage Evidencing
Devices or PED's. It should be understood, however, that
the term "postage meter" as used herein will refer to
both types.Also as used herein a postal value bearing indicia
will sometimes be called a Postal Revenue Block or PRB.
The PRB typically contains data such as the postage
value, a unique meter or PED identification number, the
date and in some applications the name of the place where
the mail is originating.From the Post Office's point of view, it will be
appreciated that the digital printing makes it fairly
easy for someone to counterfeit a PRB since any suitable
computer and printer may be used to generate multiple
copies of the image.In order to validate a mailpiece, that is to assure
that accounting for the postage amount printed on a
mailpiece has been properly done, it is known to include
an encrypted number as a part of the franking such that,
for instance, the value of the franking may be
determined from the encryption to learn whether the value
as printed on the mailpiece is correct. See, for 
example, U.S. Patent 4,757,537 and 4,775,246 to Edelmann
et al. as well as U.S. Patent 4,649,266 to Eckert. It is
also known to authenticate a mailpiece by including the
address as a further part of the encryption as described
in U.S. Patent 4,725,718 to Sansone et al. and U.S.
Patent 4,743,747 to Fougere et al.U.S. Patent 5,170,044 to Pastor describes a system
which includes binary arrays and the actual arrays of
pixels are scanned in order to identify the provider of
the mailpiece and to recover other encrypted plain text
information. U.S. Patent 5,142,577 to Pastor describes
various alternatives to DES encoding for encrypting a
message and for comparing the decrypted postal
information to the plain text information on the
mailpiece.US-A-4,934,846 describes a system employing a
plurality
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A system for controlling the validity of printing of
indicias on mailpieces from a plurality of users of

respective postage meters (12) of the type having
computer means and a printer (150) for printing an

indicia (172) on a mailpiece for indicating an amount of
dispensed postage on the mailpiece, the system comprising

apparatus (155, 105, 140, 145) disposed in each said
postage meter for generating a code and for printing the

code on each mailpiece using said printer (150), said
code being an encrypted code representative of the

postage meter apparatus printing the indicia and other
information uniquely determinative of the legitimacy of

the amount of postage printed on the mailpieces, each
said code generating apparatus changing its code

generation at predetermined intervals in each of said
plurality of postage meters and a security center (56)

including apparatus for maintaining a security code
database (58) and for generating security codes in

correspondence with the changes in each said code
generating apparatus and the information printed on the

mailpiece by the postage meter apparatus for comparison
with the code printed on the mailpiece.
The system of Claim 1, wherein said other
information on the mailpiece comprises data as to which

information items are included in the encrypted code
printed on the mailpiece. 
The system of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the code
generating apparatus code generation is changed for each

successive mailpiece.
The system of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the code
generating apparatus changes its code generation at the

time of each inspection.
The system of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the code
generating apparatus changes its code generation at

predetermined time intervals.
The system of Claim 5, wherein the time interval is
a daily time interval.
The system of Claim 1 further comprising means for
printing an additional code on the mailpiece and another

security center for generating codes in correspondence
with said additional code.
The system of Claim 7 further comprising a meter
fund resetting center for maintaining further information

relating to the meter from which meter user information
may be obtained.
The system of Claim 7 or 8, wherein the apparatus
for generation of secret keys at the security center is

maintained in a secure manner separate from the security
code database.
The system of any one of Claims 7 to 9, wherein the
additional code is encrypted from data including the

security code. 
A system according to Claim 1, wherein the apparatus
for generation of security codes comprises means for

generating first and second codes using respective
different keys and there being two separate security

centers, each center being operative for comparison of
only one of the respective first and second codes.
The system of Claim 11, wherein one of said first or
said second codes is an encryption of information

including the other code.
