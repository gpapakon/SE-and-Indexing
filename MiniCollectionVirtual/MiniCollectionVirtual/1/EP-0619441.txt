which a rubber visco-elastic layer (2) or such layers 

is or are disposed on one or two surfaces of a metal 
plate (1), are laminated on each other, so that rubber 

visco-elastic layers (2) are opposite to each other, 
and adhered to each other to form a laminated body ;

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration damping
body suitable for a washer used for a clamping bolt in a
machine, an apparatus, etc. or a body constructed by press
such as an oil pan, a ventilation buffle plate, etc. in an
automobile and a method for fabricating same.Recently sound proof material in a broad sense is
used in not to speak of automobiles, but a number of fields
such as electric home appliances and construction materials.
It plays an important role for reducing noise, which
constitutes a great social problem.Noise is produced generally in such a manner that
various sorts of vibrations generated by movement in
different kinds of machines and apparatuses originating it,
are transferred to other members, are resonated therewith,
and radiated them as noise. Vibration isolation materials
are used for preventing this transfer of vibrations to other
members (vibration isolation).The vibration isolation materials described above are
roughly classified into a group of coil springs and another
group of vibration isolation rubbers. Coil springs are used
for lowering vibration level by varying a natural frequency
to avoid resonance with vibration having an object frequency,
while vibration isolation rubbers attenuate vibration
principally by internal friction within a visco-elastic body
made of rubber to isolate vibration as the result.Among the vibration isolation materials described
above, generally vibration isolation rubbers are used for
vibration isolation in a wide frequency range. In particular,
a vibration isolation washer formed in a washer shape is 
used often in a portion bound by means of a bolt for the
purpose of preventing that engine vibration in automobile,
etc. is transferred to another member such as a head cover,
an oil pan, etc. through a clamping bolt, etc. and radiated
as noise.Usual vibration isolation washers are mainly made of
rubber-molded bodies and further in addition to them, various
constructions such as a washer made of rubber alone, a washer
in which metal plates are stuck by vulcanization adhesion on
the upper and lower surfaces of a simple rubber body, etc.
are used, depending on the field of utilization.In particular, for the head cover of an engine a
vibration isolation washer, in which a metal support is stuck
to a surface of a rubber piece by vulcanization adhesion, is
widely utilized. One of the most important features of this
type of vibration isolation rubbers consists in that not only
the sort and the shape thereof can be arbitrarily chosen,
depending on
