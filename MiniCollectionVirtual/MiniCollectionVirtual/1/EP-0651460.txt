<ABSTRACT>
A coaxial antenna has a vertical half-wave dipole whose lower section is designed as a sealed dipole connection and whose upper section is designed as a first conductor rod. The first conductor rod is electrically connected at its free end to one end of a phase line whose other end is electrically connected to one end of a second conductor rod. The arrangement comprising the first conductor rod, the phase line and the second conductor rod is preferably designed in such a manner that it resonates in the D-network mobile-telephone frequency band of 890 to 960 megahertz, and the lower section of the half-wave dipole, which is designed as the sealed dipole connection, preferably resonates in the VHF maritime radio frequency band of 156 to 163 megahertz.
