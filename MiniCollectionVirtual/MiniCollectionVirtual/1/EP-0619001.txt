<ABSTRACT>
A centrifugal pump having a diffuser (1) engaging with a rotor (25), a suction body (2) and a delivery body (3) fixed to the upstream and the downstream ends (1a, 1b) of the diffuser respectively and provided with corresponding suction and delivery chambers (4, 5). The diffuser (1) is housed in a spacing case (8a) defining a jacket (8) fixed between the bodies (2, 3) and communicating withe delivery chamber (5). The suction body (2) comprises a multifonctional chamber (9) communicating with the jacket (8) and provided with a first and a second auxiliary outlet (10, 11) communicating with the suction chamber (4) and with the external respectively. There are provided plugging means engaging with the auxiliary outlets (10, 11) and suitable for different pumping functions such as depth suction, self-priming, pressure adjustment, self-priming combined with pressure adjustment, automatic start up and shut down functions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally related to the 
pumps field and more precisely relates to a centrifugal 
water pump having the multiple functions of depth suction, 
self-priming, pressure adjustment, self-priming with 
pressure adjustment, automatic start up and shut down. At the present time there are known both self-priming 
centrifugal pumps and depth suction centrifugal pumps. The first type of these pumps comprises an internal 
by-pass through which a little share of water circulates 
backwards from the delivery side to the suction side, thus 
allowing the pump to be always flooded during the 
elimination of the air present in the suction pipe. When 
this air is ended the pressure increases causing a ball 
valve provided in the by-pass to stop such backflow so as to 
reduce the pressure drops inside the pump. An example of a pump of this first type is disclosed in FR-A-2 044 994 wherein the by-pass is defined by a jacket provided externally to the body of the pump and also forming both the inlet and the delivery ports. The water flowing in the jacket from the delivery to the inlet, and parallely to inlet channel, reaches the inlet through a unidirectional valve. Other types of 
self-priming pumps are not provided with the ball valve in 
the by-pass and reduce the pressure drop due to the 
permanent internal circulation of water by means of a 
Venturi tube at the delivery side. The second type of these pumps comprises a minor 
delivery outlet through which a share of flow is led to an 
ejector placed at the suction point (i.e. in a deep well) so 
as to increase the local pressure and allowing the water to  
 
be sucked by the pump in spite of the depth. Concerning the pressure adjustment, the pumps are 
provided with external circuits comprising either pressure 
control valves or flow control valves or speed control 
devices of the engine. As concerning the start up and shut down of the 
engine, the pumps can be provided with automatic devices 
comprising pressure switches connected with the power supply 
of the engine of the pump and operating in case of 
overcoming the pressure limits inside the body of the pump. The above described pumps are able to solve separately 
the priming, depth suction, pressure adjustment and 
automatic shut down and start up problems, but at the 
present time said features and functions have never been 
combined. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
centrifugal pump having the multiple functions of depth 
suction, self-priming, internal pressure
