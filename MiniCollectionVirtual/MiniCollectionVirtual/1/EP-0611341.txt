Floor covering based on thermoplastic synthetic resin material with 
a decorative visible side and an underside, 
characterised in that
 it 
comprises a number of layers of pieces (6, 7) of sheet of 

thermoplastic synthetic resin material compressed and at least 
partially bonded together by the action of pressure and temperature. 
Floor covering according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
surface of the visible walked upon side of the floor covering is 

provided with a wear-resistant and non-slip sheet layer. 
Floor covering according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
synthetic resin sheet material (6, 7) in the form of pieces comprises 

pieces of polyolefin sheet, in particular polyethylene sheet. 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 its underside is provided with a layer of 
polyolefin material, in particular a fabric, a felt or sprayed-on 

material which eases the adhesion of the floor covering. 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 air inclusions are present between the 
compressed and bonded together pieces (6, 7) of sheet. 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 its thickness lies between 1mm and 10mm 
and preferably amounts to 3mm to 6mm.  

 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 at least the one region near the surface is 
compressed more than the region further from the surface. 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the decorative visible side of the covering is 
given a multi-colour pattern or a single colour. 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the coloured pattern is achieved by a 
deliberate insertion of pieces (6, 7) of sheet. 
Floor covering according to one of the foregoing claims, 

characterised in that
 the walked-upon side of the floor covering is 
provided with an embossed structure. 
Method of producing a floor covering according to one of claims 1 
to 10, 
characterised in that
 a number of layers of thermoplastic 
synthetic resin sheet material (6, 7) in the form of pieces are 

deposited to form a strip and compressed by the action of pressure 
and temperature at a temperature lying in the region of the 

softening temperature of the plastics material employed and the 
pieces of plastics sheet material (6, 7) are at least partially bonded 

together. 
Method according to claim 11, 
characterised in that
 a wear-resistant 
and non-slip sheet is deposited on the not-yet-compressed 

strip of pieces of sheet material and subsequently by the action of 
pressure and temperature the layers of pieces of sheet (6, 7) are 

compressed and bonded with each other and with the surface layer.  
 
Method according to claim 11, 
characterised in that
 the 
layers (6, 7) of pieces of sheet are pre-compressed in the first step 

by the action of temperature and pressure and in the second step 
they are provided with a l
ayer of sheet and are connected to the 
latter and simultaneously finally compressed by the further action 

of pressure and temperature. 
Method according to one of claims 11 to 13, 
characterised in that
 
the compression of the floor covering is achieved by means of 

calender rolls. 
Method according to one of claims 11 to 14, 
characterised in that
 
the pieces of sheet (6, 7) have a three-dimensional, in particular 

flake-like, form before compression.
