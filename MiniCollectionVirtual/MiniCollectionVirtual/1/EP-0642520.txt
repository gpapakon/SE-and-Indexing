<DESCRIPTION>
THIO SUBSTITUTED CYCLIC PHOSPHONATE COMPOUNDS FOR TREATING ABNORMAL CALCIUM AND PHOSPHATE METABOLISM.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel thio-substituted cyclic phosphonate compounds, including bisphosphonates, phosphonoalkyl- phosphinates, phosphonocarboxylates, and phosphonosulfonates, preferably bisphosphonates and phosphonoalkylphosphinates. This invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions con¬ taining these novel compounds. This invention also relates to a method of treating or preventing metabolic bone disorders characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism by utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Specifically, this invention relates to a method of treating or preventing osteoporosis and arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, by utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.A number of pathological conditions which can afflict humans and lower animals involve abnormal calcium and phosphate metabo¬ lism. Such conditions may be divided into two broad categories: (1) Conditions which are characterized by anomalous mobil- ization of calcium and phosphate leading to general or specific bone loss, such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease; or excessively high calcium and phosphate levels in the fluids of the body, such as hypercalcemia of tumor origin. Such conditions are sometimesSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

 referred to herein as pathological hard tissue de ineralizations.(2) Conditions which cause or result from deposition of calcium and phosphate anomalously in the body, such as arthritis. These conditions are sometimes referred to herein as pathological calcifications.The first category includes the most common metabolic bone disorder, osteoporosis; osteoporosis is a condition in which bone hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the development of new hard tissue. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of skeletal tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be subclassified as menopausal , senile, drug-induced (e.g. adreno- corticoid, as can occur in steroid therapy), disease-induced(arthritic and tumor), etc.; however, the manifestations are the same. In general, there are two types of osteoporosis: primary and secondary. "Secondary osteoporosis" is the result of a separate identifiable disease process or agent. However,
