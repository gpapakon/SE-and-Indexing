Supporting plate for bridges and ramps which are 
provided with a roadway, including longitudinal supports 

(1), which are disposed on each side and are connected 
by means of a plurality of rectangular or square, hollow 

transverse profiles (4), which extend parallel to one 
another and form the roadway, the portions of said 

transverse profiles which face one another communicating 
with one another, one of the two portions (6) of the 

transverse profiles which face one another having one or 
more projection members, which are distributed over the 

length of the transverse profiles and on which the 
adjacent transverse profile is supported, characterised 

in that the projection member is formed by an angle 
portion (9) of an angled member (7), the other angle 

portion (8) of said angled member abutting laterally 
against the transverse profile (4) and being secured by 

welding or the like. 
Supporting plate according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the mutual spacing between 

adjacent transverse profiles (4) is determined by the 
wall thickness of an angle portion (8) of the angled 

member (7). 
Supporting plate according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the angled member (7) protrudes 

downwardly beyond its associated transverse profile (4). 
Supporting plate according to claim 1, 
characterised in that a plurality of angled members (7), 

preferably about three to six, are distributed,  
 

especially uniformly, over the length of the transverse 
profile (4). 
Supporting plate according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the mutual spacing between 

adjacent angled members (7) is about 40 - 80 cm. 
Supporting plate according to claim 1, 
characterised in that a U-shaped profile (11) is 

attached, at least in some places, to the transverse 
profiles (4), the crosspiece portion (10) of said 

U-shaped profile being provided with means (12) which 
increase the resistance to skidding, and the downwardly 

orientated angle portions (13) of said U-shaped profile 
being disposed between adjacent transverse profiles (4). 
Supporting plate according to claims 1 and 6, 
characterised in that the length of the U-shaped 

profiles (11) corresponds to the mutual spacing between 
the projection members (7) or respectively their 

securements (8). 
Supporting plate according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the angle portions (13) of the 

U-shaped profiles (11) are retained, by means of 
clamping, between two adjacent transverse profiles (4).
