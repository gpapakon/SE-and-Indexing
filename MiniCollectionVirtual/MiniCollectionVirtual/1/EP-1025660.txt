<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an optical emitter having a modulatable laser source with stable wavelength. The signal from the laser source passes through at least one Michelson band-pass filter in order to prevent interfering signals with different wavelengths from the emitted wavelength  lambda i from affecting the laser.

<CLAIMS>
Optical transmitter having a modulatable laser
source (1) of stable wavelength, whose signal

(位
i,u
) is launched into a waveguide (18), and
having a Michelson bandpass filter (15, 14),


characterized in that
 the signal (位
i,u
) of the
laser source (1) is launched into an optical fibre

(4) of a transmission link via a planar waveguide
(18) and after traversing the Michelson bandpass

filter (15, 14).
Optical transmitter according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the laser source (1) is a
semiconductor laser (7) with an adapted beam shape

and a Bragg grating (11).
Optical transmitter according to Claim 2,

characterized in that
 the active strip waveguide
in the semiconductor laser (7) runs obliquely to

the antireflection coating (9), and the planar
waveguide (18) runs obliquely to the coupling

point (10).
Optical transmitter according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the laser source (1)
comprises a waveguide laser (16) which is pumped

by a semiconductor laser (7) and downstream of
which an external modulator (2) is connected. 
Optical transmitter according to Claim 4,

characterized in that
 the emission wavelength (位
i
)
of the laser source (1) is determined by a Bragg

grating (11).
Optical transmitter according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
Michelson bandpass filter (15, 14) is

simultaneously an optical isolator for other
wavelengths than the emission wavelength (位
i
) of
the laser source (1).
Optical transmitter according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the open
ends of the Michelson bandpass filter (15, 14) end

in a wave sink.
Optical transmitter according to Claim 7,
