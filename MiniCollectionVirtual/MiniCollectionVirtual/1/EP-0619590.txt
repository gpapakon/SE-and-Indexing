<ABSTRACT>
Each cut-off module (14) is formed by a plastic, parallelepipedal, monobloc bulb (16), housed in the corresponding compartment (96), (98), (100) of the base (88), the said bulb enclosing at least one fixed contact (34), (36), an arc extinction chamber (84) and a pair of regions (38), (42) for connecting to a terminal (40) and to the triggering module (46) of the same pole. A mechanical actuation module (122) consisting of the switching bar (82) and mechanism (60) assembly is made integral with the cover (90). The rotary triggering bar (52) is supported by clipping means (138), (140) formed at the lower face of the cover (90). A plurality of recesses (114), (116) and of cutouts (138), (140) are formed in the spacers (94), (95) of the base (88) to serve as first bearing surfaces respectively for the switching bar (82) and the triggering bar (52) when the first subassembly (A) consisting of the base (88) with the set of cut-off modules (14) and of triggering modules (46), (46a) is juxtaposed with the second subassembly (B) consisting of the cover (90) on which are fixed the mechanical actuation module (122), the triggering bar (52) and the latch (58).

A multipole circuit breaker with a moulded insulating case comprising : 

a base plate (88) subdivided by spacers (94), (95) into several juxtaposed 
compartments (96), (98), (100) for housing the different poles, each pole comprising a 

breaking module (14) with separable contacts (34), (36), (24), and a trip module (46), 
(46a), 
a cover (90) fixed onto the base plate (88) to close the case (12), 
an operating mechanism (60), mounted between a pair of support plates (66), (68), 
and having a toggle device (62) associated to a connecting spring (72), and to a 

tripping hook (70), 
a handle (64) coupled to the mechanism (60), and passing through an aperture (65) 
of the cover (90) to be accessible from outside, 
a switching bar (82) made of insulating material acting as support for the movable 
contacts (24) of all the poles, said bar mechanically coupled to the toggle device (62) 

being mounted with limited rotation between the closed position and the open position 
of the contacts, 
a trip bar (52) cooperating with the trip modules (46), (46a) of the poles, and with a 
latch (58) of the tripping hook (70), 
 
characterized in that : 


each breaking module (14) is formed by a parallelepipedic monoblock cartridge (16) 
made of plastic material, housed in the corresponding compartment (96), (98), (100) 

of the base plate (88), said cartridge housing at least a stationary contact (34), (36), 
an arc extinguishing chamber (84), and a pair of connecting strips (38), (42) for 

connection to a terminal (40) and to the trip module (46) of the same pole, 
a mechanical actuation module (122) constituted by the switching bar (82) and 
mechanism (60) assembly, is securedly united to the cover (90),  

 
the rotary trip bar (52) is supported by clipping means (138), (140) arranged on the 
bottom face of the cover (90), 
and a plurality of recesses (114), (116) and cutouts (138), (140) arranged in the 
spacers (94), (95) of the base plate (88) to act as first bearing surfaces respectively 

for the switching bar (82) and trip bar (52) when the first sub-assembly A composed 
of the base plate (88) with the set of breaking modules (14) and trip modules (46), 

(46a), is adjoined to the second sub-assembly B formed by the cover (90) on which 
the mechanical actuation module (122), trip bar (52) and latch (58) are fitted. 
The multipole circuit breaker according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cartridge (16) of each breaking module (14) comprises a front panel (20) provided 

with an orifice (22) for passage of the corresponding movable contact (24), and two 
parallel large side panels (26), (28) having notches (110), (112) aligned with the 

recesses (114), (116) of the spacers (94), (95) in the transverse direction of the bar 
(82), and that the bar (82) comprises at least two cylindrical bearing surfaces (102), 

(104) positioned between two lower half-bearings formed by juxtaposition of the 
recesses (114), (116) of the spacers (94), (95) and of the notches (110), (112) of the 

cartridges (16), and two upper half-bearings constituted by curved second bearing 
surfaces (144), (146) securedly united to the support plates (66), (68) of the 

mechanism (60). 
The multipole circuit breaker according to claim 2, characterized in that the spacers 
(94), (95) present elongated apertures (118), (120) extending in the longitudinal 

direction to arrange separating gaps between the compartments (96), (98), (100) of 
the base plate (88), and that each bearing surface (102), (104) of the bar (82) is 

provided with a centering ring (106), (108) designed to engage in the corresponding 
aperture (118), (120) of the spacers (94), (95). 
The multipole circuit breaker according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that the
