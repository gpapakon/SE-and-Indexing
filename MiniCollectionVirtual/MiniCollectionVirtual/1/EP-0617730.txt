<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a thermochromic effect pigment comprising a thermochromic liquid crystal material encapsulated with a polymer and coated with one or more inorganic metal oxides or nearly insoluble metal salts selected from Al2O3, SnO2, ZrO2, TiO2, CaO, SiO2, ZnO, MgO or BaSO4. The pigment is stable in solvent-based formulations and can be used as colourant in form of an aqueous suspension or as powder in lacquer compositions, plastic compositions, dyed filter compositions, dyed glass compositions, dyed cosmetic compositions, printing ink compositions, and in hair colouring agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thermochromic effect pigment 
comprising a thermochromic liquid crystal material encapsulated 
with a polymer and coated with one or more inorganic 
metal oxides or nearly insoluble metal salts. There is a continuously increasing demand for liquid crystal 
pigment as coating layer onto a substrate or for use in 
printing, in lacquer formulations, in plastics and cosmetics. 
At present, for make-up cosmetics such as foundations, eye 
shadows, cheek rouges and other cosmetics thermochromic 
effect pigments are desired because of their colour play. EP-A-0 383 376 discloses a liquid crystal pigment consisting 
of a lamellar particle which is coated with a liquid crystalline 
material. The pigment is manufactured by dissolving a 
liquid crystalline material in a suitable solvent, dispersing 
a lamellar particle in the solvent and coating the lamellar 
particle by precipitating a portion of the liquid crystalline 
material from the solution onto the lamellar particle. This 
pigment has the disadvantage that it is not resistant against 
solvents, has low mechanical stability and poor flowability. Accordingly, it is object of the present invention to provide 
thermochromic effect pigments with improved resistance 
against solvents and good mechanical stability and flowability 
so that it can be used like a common pigment. Furthermore 
it is an object of the present invention to modify colour 
play and colour change in a definite way.  This object is accomplished according to the present invention 
by a thermochromic effect pigment comprising an encapsulated 
thermochromic liquid crystal which is coated with one 
or more inorganic metal oxides, mixtures of inorganic metal 
oxides, or nearly insoluble metal salts. Furthermore this object is accomplished according to the 
present invention by a process for preparing thermochromic 
effect pigments by precipitating a metal oxide or metal salt 
in an aqueous suspension onto the encapsulated liquid crystal 
in well-known manner. The inorganic metal oxides or metal salts can be selected for 
example from Al₂O₃, SnO₂, CaO, SiO₂, ZrO₂, TiO₂, ZnO, MgO or 
BaSO₄ and can be precipitated onto the encapsulated liquid 
crystal as single oxide or as mixed oxide thereof. The mixed 
oxide preferably contains silicon dioxide. The amount of 
metal oxides or salts in the thermochromic effect pigment as 
a rule is from 2 to 50 %, preferably from 5 to 15 % by 
weight, relative to total pigment weight. The encapsulated thermochromic liquid crystal material is
