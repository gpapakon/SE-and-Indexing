<ABSTRACT>
A current monitoring assembly 12 of a circuit 
breaker includes a coil 16, a tube 18 slidably mounted 

in the coil 16, a core 20 slidably housed within the 
tube 18, a first pole piece 22 mounted on an end of the 

tube 18 and an "O"-shaped magnetic frame 24 having a 
second pole piece 26 aligned with the first pole piece 

22. A retarding fluid is contained within the tube 18 
and a core spring 46 is arranged intermediate an end of 

the core 20 and the pole piece 22.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to
a current
monitoring assembly
according to the preamble of claim 1 which is based on document US-A-3 337 824.According to the invention there is provided a
current monitoring assembly according to Claim 1. Preferred features of this aspect of the invention as set out in Claims 2 to 6.A circuit breaker which includes the assembly according to the invention is defined
in Claim 7.Preferred features of this circuit breaker are set out in Claims 8 to 9.It will be appreciated that the tube will be urged
away from the second pole piece towards its first position. This may be
accomplished by a further spring, or by means of the
tripping member of the circuit breaker, the tripping member being in contact
with the first pole piece and being urged in some manner
so as to urge the tube away from the second pole piece.The assembly may further have a bobbin on which the
coil is wound and in which the tube slides. The
magnetic circuit defining means may then comprise an
"O"-shaped magnetic frame, the second pole piece forming
part thereof. The retarding fluid may be in liquid form.The first pole piece may conveniently be used to
close off the tube in an hermetically sealed manner.It will be appreciated that movement of the tube in
one direction will be limited by the second pole piece.
Movement of the tube in the other direction may
conveniently be limited by having the first pole piece
sufficiently large so that it engages the bobbin.The tube may be supported within the bobbin in a
low-friction manner thereby to facilitate sliding
movement of the tube in the bobbin.It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art
that circuit breakers have previously utilised an
armature which is attracted to the pole piece with
movement of the armature tripping the switching
mechanism of the circuit breaker. With the assembly of
the invention the armature is eliminated and a larger
force is provided for displacing a tripping component of
the breaker.An embodiment of the invention is now described by way of example
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: -
Figure 1 shows schematically a current monitoring
assembly in accordance with the invention together with 
a portion of the tripping mechanism of a circuit breaker
in their normal operative configuration; andFigure 2 shows the assembly and the portion of the
tripping mechanism in an overload tripping
configuration.Referring to the drawings, a part of a circuit
breaker is indicated generally. The breaker includes a
current monitoring
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A current monitoring assembly (12) which includes

a tube (18) that is of a non-magnetic material, which has first and second ends
(18.1, 18.2) and which is slidably mounted to be movable between first and second

positions;
a coil (16) around the tube (18), the coil having a first and a second end, a first end
of the coil (16) being adjacent the first end (18.1) of the tube (18) and the second end of the coil (16) being

adjacent the second end (18.2) of the tube (18);
a core (20) within the tube (18), the core (20) being of a magnetic material and being
slidably housed within the tube (18);
a retarding fluid contained in the tube (18) for retarding movement of the core (20);
a core spring (46) within the tube (18) for urging the core (20) towards the first end (18.1) of the
tube (18);
a first pole piece (22) mounted on the tube (18) at the second end (18.2) thereof;
a magnetic circuit defining means (24), for defining a magnetic circuit around
the coil (16), which has a second pole piece (26) aligned with the first pole piece (22) and being

positioned relative to the first pole piece (22) such that the first pole piece (22) is movable into
and out of contact with the second pole piece (26) on movement of the tube (18) between its first

and second positions; and
an urging means (36, 42, 39) for urging the tube (18) towards its first position;

   characterized in that there is a gap between the second end of the coil (16) and the
second pole piece (26), and that the first pole piece (22) is located between the second end of the

coil (16) and the second pole piece (26) when the tube (18) is in its first and its second positions.
An assembly as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that it includes a bobbin
(30), the coil (16) being carried by the bobbin (30) and the tube (18) being slidable therein. 
An assembly according to Claim 1, in which the tube (18) is circular cylindrical and
the first pole piece (22) is circular, and characterized in that the first pole piece (22) has a greater

diameter than the tube (18).
An assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in that the magnetic circuit
defining means comprises a magnetic frame (24), the second pole piece (26) forming part

thereof.
An assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in that the tube (18) is hermetically
sealed.
An assembly according to Claim 2, characterized in that the first pole piece (22) is
sufficiently large to engage the bobbin (30) and limit movement of the tube (18) away from the

second pole piece (26).
A circuit breaker, which includes

a tripping mechanism (14) having a tripping member (36);

   characterized in that it includes a current monitoring assembly (12) as claimed
in Claim 1, with the tripping member (36) being displaced by the tube (18) upon movement

thereof from its first position to its second position.
A circuit breaker as claimed in Claim 7, characterized in that the first pole piece (22)
engages the tripping member (36).
A circuit breaker as claimed in Claim 8, characterized in that the second pole
piece (26) has an opening (44) and the tripping member extends therethrough.
