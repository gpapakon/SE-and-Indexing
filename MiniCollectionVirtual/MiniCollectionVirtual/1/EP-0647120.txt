<ABSTRACT>
Methods and systems are described that examine a subject (8, 70) positioned between input and detection ports of the spectroscopic system applied to the subject. The systems shown include at least one light source (12, 14, 16, 18), radiation pattern controller (85, 120), at least one detector, processor and evaluator. The light source introduces at one or multiple input ports (11, 13, 15, 17), electromagnetic non-ionizing radiation of a known time-varying pattern of photon density of a wavelength selected to be scattered and absorbed while migrating in the subject. The radiation pattern controller controls the time-varying relationship between the introduced patterns (i.e., relative phase, relative amplitude, relative frequency) to achieve a directional pattern of emitted resulting radiation that possesses substantial gradient of photon density. The emitted directional radiation pattern utilizes its gradient of photon density to detect a hidden object (9) while scanning across the examined subject.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to spectroscopic examination of
subjects.Traditionally, potentially harmful ionizing
radiation (for example, X-ray or Î³-ray) has been used to
image biological tissue. This radiation propagates in the
tissue on straight, ballistic tracks, i.e., scattering of
the radiation is negligible. Thus, imaging is based on
evaluation of the absorption levels of different tissue
types. For example, in roentgenography the X-ray film
contains darker and lighter spots. In more complicated
systems, such as computerized tomography (CT), a cross-sectional
picture of human organs is created by
transmitting X-ray radiation through a section of the
human body at different angles and by electronically
detecting the variation in X-ray transmission. The
detected intensity information is digitally stored in a
computer which reconstructs the X-ray absorption of the
tissue at a multiplicity of points located in one cross-sectional
plane.Near infra-red radiation (NIR) has been used to
study non-invasively the oxygen metabolism in tissue (for
example, the brain, finger, or ear lobe). Using visible,
NIR and infra-red (IR) radiation for medical imaging
could bring several advantages. In the NIR or IR range
the contrast factor between a tumor and a tissue is much
larger than in the X-ray range. In addition, the visible
to IR radiation is preferred over the X-ray radiation
since it is non-ionizing; thus, it potentially causes
fewer side effects. However, with lower energy
radiation, such as visible or infra-red radiation, the 
radiation is strongly scattered and absorbed in
biological tissue, and the migration path cannot be
approximated by a straight line, making inapplicable
certain aspects of cross-sectional imaging techniques.Recently, certain approaches to NIR imaging have
been suggested. One approach undertaken by Oda et al. in
"Non-Invasive Hemoglobin Oxygenation Monitor and
Computerized Tomography of NIR Spectrometry," SPIE Vol.
1431, p. 284, 1991, utilizes NIR radiation in an
analogous way to the use of X-ray radiation in an X-ray
CT. In this device, the X-ray source is replaced by
three laser diodes emitting light in the NIR range. The
NIR-CT uses a set of photomultipliers to detect the light
of the three laser diodes transmitted through the imaged
tissue. The detected data are manipulated by a computer
of the original X-ray CT scanner system in the same way
as the detected X-ray data would be.Different approaches were suggested by S.R.
