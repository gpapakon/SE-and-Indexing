<ABSTRACT>
Pick-up baler for parallelepipedal bales of fodder including a compression passage (10) delimited by walls having at least one articulated flap (18) which can apply an adjustable resistance to the forward movement of the portions of fodder (13) in the said passage, a transmission assembly (44) intended to drive the piston (12) to and fro in the said compression passage (10) and including a gear motor unit (46) and a crank (48) and rod (50) assembly interposed between the said gear motor unit (46) and the said piston (12), a device (42) for detecting the compressive loads applied by the said piston (12) to the portions of fodder (13) present in the said compression passage (10) and intended to provide a signal representing the said compressive loads, hydraulic means (20, 24, 34, 36) intended automatically to regulate the position of the said flap (18) on the basis of the said signal in order to control the density of the bales. The said pick-up baler is characterised in that the detection device (42) includes a reaction arm (68) interposed between the frame (70) of the pick-up baler and the said gear motor unit (46) so as to be subjected, during compressive strokes of the piston (12), to reaction forces which are proportional to the compressive forces applied by the piston (12) to the portions of fodder (13) present in the compression passage (10), and strain gauges (42) associated with the said reaction arm (68) and intended to detect the stresses induced in the said reacton arm (68) by the said reaction forces making it possible to deduce therefrom the said signal representing the said compressive loads.

Pick-up baler including:

a frame (70),
a compression duct (10) into which successive wads of
fodder (13) are introduced, said compression duct (10) being

delimited by walls having at least one articulated flap (18),
a main plunger (12) driven to-and-fro in said
compression duct (10) in order to move said wads of fodder

(13) forwards therein, said flap (18) being able to apply a
variable resistance to the forward movement of said wads of

fodder (13) whereby, on the one hand, said plunger (12)
compresses said wads of fodder (13) to constitute bales

therefrom and, on the other hand, said flap (18) controls the
density of said bales,
a transmission system (44) including a gear motor (46)
to drive said plunger (12) to-and-fro, said gear motor (46)

being subjected, during compression strokes of the plunger
(12), to reaction forces proportional to the compression

forces applied by the plunger (12) to the wads of fodder (13)
present in the compression duct,
a device (42) for detecting compression forces applied
by said plunger (12) to the wads of fodder (13) present in

said compression duct (10) during the compression strokes of
said plunger (12), said detector device (42) being adapted to

supply a signal representative of said compression forces,
and
hydraulic means (20, 24, 34, 36) adapted to adjust
automatically the position of said flap (18) as a function of

said signal in order to control the density of the bales,

   characterized in that:

a reaction arm in the form of a tie rod (68) is disposed
between the frame (60) and the gear motor (46) to take up

said reaction forces on the gear motor (46), and
the compression force detector device (42) consists of
strain gauges associated with said reaction arm (68) in such 

a manner as to detect reaction forces induced in said tie rod
(68) by said reaction forces, enabling said compression

forces to be deduced therefrom.
Pick-up baler according to claim 1, characterized in
that the tie rod (68) extends generally along the axis of the

compression duct (10).
Pick-up baler according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that:


an electronic control unit (40/72) is provided between
the strain gauges (42) and the hydraulic means (20, 24, 34,

36) and is adapted to control said hydraulic means (20, 24,
34, 36) as a function of said reaction forces induced in said

tie rod (68), and
the strain gauges (42) are connected in a "bridge" and
acted on by the tie rod (68), said strain gauges (42) being

connected to a signal conditioning and amplifier circuit (74)
forming part of the electronic control unit (40/72) and said

circuit (74) producing an output signal whose voltage is a
function of the reaction force exerted on the tie rod (68).
Pick-up baler according to claim 3, characterized in
that the electronic control unit (40/72) comprises a

comparator circuit (76) in which the signal received from the
signal conditioning and amplifier circuit (74) is compared to

a reference threshold (S) representative of a maximum
required compression force of the plunger (12), said

comparator circuit (76) delivering at its output a signal
either at a predetermined voltage if the signal applied to

the comparator circuit (76) is above the threshold signal (S)
or at a zero voltage if the signal applied to the comparator

circuit (76) is below the threshold signal (S).
Pick-up baler according to claim 4, characterized in
that the threshold signal (S) is of variable voltage. 
Pick-up baler according to claim 5, characterized in
that:


the hydraulic means (20, 24, 34, 36) include a hydraulic
ram (20) associated with said flap (18) so that said flap

(18) applies a transverse force to at least one external area
of the bale (16) being formed in the compression duct (10)

when said hydraulic ram is supplied with fluid, and
the electronic control unit (40/72) comprises a
switching circuit (78) between a power supply (62) and the

hydraulic means (20, 24, 34, 36), said switching circuit (78)
being disposed to receive the output signal of the comparator

circuit (76) and to control the hydraulic means (20, 24, 34,
36) so that the hydraulic ram (20) is pressurized if the

comparator circuit (76) delivers a signal at a zero voltage
and the hydraulic ram (20) is depressurized if the comparator

circuit (76) delivers a signal at a predetermined voltage.
