<ABSTRACT>
Recombinant xylanases are derived from anaerobic fungi, particularly Neocallimastix patriciarum. The enzymes are highly specific for xylans and have industrial value, particularly in the pulp and paper industries. Certain truncated forms of the enzymes, and enzymes encoded by truncated DNA sequences, are preferred for their high expression levels.

<DESCRIPTION>
 RECOMBINA-NT XYLANASESThis invention relates to recombinant xylanases derivable from an anaerobic fungus.Xylan, a major component of plant hemicelluloses, consists of a polymer of 1,4- linked /3-D-xylopyranose units substituted with mainly acetyl, arabinosyl and glucuronosyl residues. Hardwood xylan is typically O-acetyl-4-O- methylglucuronoxylan with approximately ten percent of xylose units α- 1 ,2-linked to a 4-O-methylglucuronic acid side chain, and seventy percent of xylose residues acetylated at the C-2 or C-3 positions. Softwood xylans are commonly arabino-4- O-methyl-glucuronoxylans in which more than ten percent of xylose units are substituted with -l,3-linked arabionfuranose residues. A repertoire of microbial enzymes act co-operatively to convert xylan to its constituent simple sugars. These include endo-0-l,4-xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8), /3-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) and a series of enzymes which cleave side-chain sugars (glycosidases) or remove acetyl groups from the xylan backbone (Dekker R.F.H., and Richards, G.N., Adv. Carbo ydr. Chem. Biochem. 32: 277-352 (1976); Biely, Trends Biotechnol. 3: 286-290 (1985); Poutanen et al, "Accessory Enzymes Involved in the Hydrolysis of Xylans" In: Enzymes in Biomass Conversion. ACS Symposium Series 460. pp426-436. Ed. G.F. Letham. (1991)). Xylanolytic micro-organisms generally express isoenzymic forms of xylanases which are encoded by multiple genes (Hazlewood et al, FΕMS Microbiol. Lett. 51: 231-236 (1988); Gilbert et al, J. Gen. Microbiol. 134: 3239-3247 (1988); Clarke et al, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 83: 305-310 (1991)).Some xylanases hydrolyse only xylan (Hall et al, Mol. Microbiol. 3: 1211-1219 (1989); Wong et al, Microbiol. Rev. 52: 305-317 (1988). Many microorganisms that hydrolyse xylan also degrade cellulose. In view of the similarity of the bond 

cleaved (/3-1,4-glycosidic linkages), and the cross-specificity sometimes observed between cellulases and xylanases, the phylogenetic relationships of these enzymes is an interesting question. Recently, sequence alignment and hydrophobic cluster analysis have been utilised to assign plant cell wall hydrolases to eight enzyme families (Henrissat et al, Gene 81: 83-95 (1989); Gilkes et al, Microbiol. Rev. 55:303-315 (1991)). Xylanases showed no convincing sequence identity with cellulases suggesting that the two enzyme species evolved from distinct ancestral genes.Many plant cell wall hydrolases consist of two distinct domains; a catalytic domain(CD) linked by hydroxyamino acid/proline-rich linker sequences to
