<ABSTRACT>
In a cooling device for a liquid-cooled internal combustion engine (10) of a motor vehicle with a radiator (11) connected to the feed and return line (13, 14) of the internal combustion engine (10), which radiator has a filler opening (E) closable by a cap (D), and with a temperature-controlled thermostat valve (15), by means of which the coolant is wholly or partially led through the radiator (11) or bypasses the radiator (11) through a short circuit (16) between the feed and return line (13, 14), the thermostat valve (15) can be controlled by electrical heating and an electrical switch (S) is mounted at the filler opening (E), through the actuation of which switch the thermostat valve (15) is electrically heated, so that the coolant is at least partially led through the radiator (11).

<CLAIMS>
A cooling system for a liquid-cooled internal combustion engine (10) 
of a motor vehicle with a radiator (11) connected to both the forward 

(13) and return (14) lines of the internal combustion engine, with the 
said radiator (11) having a fill opening (E) which can be closed 

through a cap (D) and a temperature-controlled thermostatic valve 
(15) which channels the coolant either fully or in part either through 

the radiator or through a bypass between the forward and return lines 
circumventing the radiator, 
characterised in that
 the thermostatic 
valve (15) can be controlled by means of electrical heating and that 

an electrical switch (S) is mounted on the fill opening (E) so that 
actuation of the switch (S) causes electrical heating of the 

thermostatic valve (15), as a result of which coolant flows at least in 
part through the radiator (11). 
A cooling system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
electrical switch (S) is actuatable by removing the cap (D) from the 

fill opening (E). 
A cooling system according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterised in 
that
 actuation causes the switch (S) to close, as a result of which an 
electric circuit for the electrical heating of the thermostatic valve (1 5) 

is closed.
