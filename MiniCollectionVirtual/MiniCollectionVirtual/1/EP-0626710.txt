<ABSTRACT>
A bypass contactor usable in a solid state motor starter for shunting current 
around a fully-conducting solid state switching device (12, 14) comprising an 

electromagnetic contactor (30) housed in a molded insulating enclosure ( 32, 34, 
36) having a plurality of bridging contacts (54) movable into and out of 

engagement with a pair of stationary contacts (46, 48) to provide plural parallel 
current paths within the contactor, the stationary contacts having rigid terminal 

portions (46b, 48b) projecting externally of the insulating enclosure connectable 
to the heat sinks (6, 8) of the solid state motor starter in a preferred manner to 

suspend the contactor above the panel (FL), permitting other components (20, 
24) to be mounted below the bypass contacts. Alternate embodiments have the 

contactor mounted to the same support (FL) as the starter power pole component 

assembly (2) and electrically connected thereto by rigid preformed connectors 
(68) or flexible braided straps (74). Also contemplated is increasing the rated 

current handling capacity by mounting a pair of the bypass contactors (30, 30') 
to the heat sinks in parallel to double the parallel current paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
Solid state motor starters control the stopping and starting of electrical 
motors by gated semiconductor devices such as SCRs or other thyristors. A 
concern in solid state motor starters is the amount of heat generated by the 
semiconductor switching devices particularly when the motor is running between 
start-up and stopping operations. This problem becomes more acute as the 
enclosures for such control are made more compact and/or contain more equipment. One method of minimizing the heat generated by solid state motor 
starter systems is to employ an electromagnetic by-pass contactor electrically 
connected in parallel with the semiconductor switching device(s) for each phase of 
the starter. The semiconductor switching device is commonly clamped between a 
pair of heat sinks which are in electrical circuit with the respective semiconductor 
switching device. Accordingly, the bypass contactor is commonly wired to the heat 
sinks by providing electrical connector lugs on the heat sinks. The size wire 
required for such applications is quite large and therefore the bending radius for the 
wire is similarly very large. Each phase, or pole, of a solid state motor starter 
requires a bypass contactor. Accordingly, the size and quantities of contactors 
required and the large wire bending area occupy considerable space within the 
enclosure. As stated above, it is a trend in present day motor starter design to 
reduce the overall size of the starter, hence the enclosure, which requires the 
individual components of the starter to be smaller in size and more closely arranged 
within the enclosure. This invention provides a compact electromagnetic contactor 
particularly well suited for bypass contactor application. It comprises an enclosure 
molded of insulating material housing an electromagnet and the contact structure. It 
employs plural double break bridging contacts operating in parallel on a pair of 
stationary contacts common to the respective bridging contacts. The stationary 
contacts are made of substantial mass and rigidly attached within the contactor  
 
enclosure to withstand large currents and dissipate heat within the contact. Rigid 
terminal portions of the stationary contacts project externally of the contactor 
enclosure to enable the contactor to be connected to the heat sinks by connector 
straps and in one preferred embodiment, to permit the contactor to be supported in 
suspended manner from the heat sinks. In an alternative embodiment preformed 
bus conductor straps are provided
