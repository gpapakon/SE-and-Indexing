<ABSTRACT>
A method of derivatizing a chromatography matrix having a hydrophobic surface. The technique involves reacting the hydrophobic surface with a halosulfonating agent to produce a significant amount of halosulfone groups covalently bonded onto the surface. Sulfonamide bonds are then formed between these halosulfone groups and a group of functions on a polyaminated polymer to produce a pellicular anion exchange layer covalently bonded to the surface. The resulting layer is stable in the absence of cross-links between the molecules of the polyaminated polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 SULFONAMIDE BONDED HYDROPHILIC COATINGSBackground of the InventionThis invention relates to the production of hydrophilic coatings on hydrophobic surfaces. Specifically, this invention relates to derivatizing a hydrophobic surface coating useful as a chromatography medium for protein separation and as a protein compatible surface.Support materials for high productivity liquid chromatography must be chemically and mechanically stable. Rigid inert polymers such as crosslinked polystyrene permit increases in operating pressure and flow rates. Unfortunately, hydrophobic interactions between such resins and proteins often are so strong that the proteins are denatured upon adsorption or during elution. Thus, it is recognized that one must post-treat the hydrophobic surface of such polymeric chromatography-packing materials to adapt it for use in the separation of proteins.It is often necessary to force liquid through chromatographic column beds because the liquid mobile phase flows too slowly under the normal force of gravity to produce acceptable separation times. The problem of flow rate is aggravated by the use of microparticulate packing geometries often used to enhance resolution. It is common in liquid chromatography, i.e., high pressure liquid chromatography or HPLC, to use pressures of 100 atmospheres or more to achieve rapid separations. 

 Soft-gel packing materials cannot tolerate more than a few atmospheres of pressure, thus are unsuited for high pressure use. As a result, these soft-gel packing materials increasingly are being replaced with rigid materials.It is at least theoretically possible to react hydrophilic moieties with sites on hydrophobic polymers to provide a hydrophilic surface character. Such post-coated materials, often referred to as pellicular materials or supports, can be produced readily if the base polymer is one having many easily derivatized reactive groups. One example of this approach involves alkylation of styrene, followed by polymerization to produce derivatized polystyrene, and subsequent surface reaction with polyoxyethylene.Another example is the derivatization of polymethacrylate. The basic hydrophobic character of this polymer may be altered if highly hydrophilic groups are introduced onto the surface through esterification. Such hydrophilic groups typically comprise hydroxyl and/or ether groups, and include such materials as glycerol, ethylene glycol, diethylamino ethanol, trimethyl ethanolamino glycolic acid, and hydroxyethylsulfonic acid.
