<ABSTRACT>
A vertical piercer/elongator mill includes a mill 
housing having a base, an open top and an open interior 

defined by a plurality of vertically extending mill posts and 
interconnecting side portions. A cylindrically shaped bottom 

cradle supports a rotatable bottom roll and is fitted in the 
mill housing through the open top thereof to assume an 

operable position within the open interior of the housing. A 
cylindrically shaped top cradle supports a rotatable top roll 

and is also received within the open interior of the mill 
housing through the open top of the housing. Vertical 

adjustment apparatus in the form of screw jacks and balance 
cylinders are associated with the upper and lower cradles to 

provide vertical movement of the cradles within the mill 
housing to establish a selected rolling gorge between the top 

and bottom rolls along a horizontally extending pass line 
defined therebetween. Hydraulically actuated feed angle 

adjustment devices are associated with the top and bottom 
cradles and mill housing to provide controlled rotative 

movement of the top and bottom cradles about a vertical axis 
to establish a selected feed angle between the top and bottom 

rolls. Hydraulic clamps are also associated with the mill 
housing to fixedly secure the top and bottom roll cradles and 

within the open interior of the mill housing after the 

selected rolling gorge and feed angle are established. 
Motorized guide shoes are provided on the mill housing on 

opposite sides of the pass line and permit quick guide shoe 
changes. The mill housing further includes an adjustable bar 

steadier to provide support for a piercer bar during startup 
and for subsequent shell support. A spindle support 

apparatus is also provided for ease in roll spindle coupling.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vertical
piercer/elongator mill according to the preamble of claim 1.Piercing of solid billet for the production of
seamless tubes is well-known in the art, dating back over the
past 100 years. For example, U.S. Patent No. 618,917
discloses a piercing mill having two conically shaped
rolls oriented in a horizontal position and U.S. Patent No.
2,025,148 discloses a piercing mill having two
conically shaped rolls oriented in a vertical position, that
is, one work roll positioned above the other.Heretofore, when different diameter product is to
be rolled in a conventional piercer or elongator, a
substantial amount of mill downtime is required in order to
make the necessary changes in the roll spacing, roll feed
angles and/or to change the rolls themselves. Substantial
time is also required for changing of guide shoes in
conventional piercer mills. It is also commonplace in the
prior art to dedicate a particular mill as a piercing mill
and a second mill as an elongator mill.DE-2,540,729-B relates to a mechanism for adjusting
the inclination of the rolls of a piercing mill. DE-73 111 05
U shows a skew rolling mill having working rolls situated
above each other. Each roll is carried in a round housing
which is rotatably adjustable about a fixed vertical axis in
arcuate sideways supported by the standard or mill housing.From GB-2,087,282-A, which is the nearest prior art
document, an apparatus is known for changing the rolling mill
rolls and dish shoes of a steel pipe rolling mill. The
apparatus includes mechanisms for raising and lowering the
top and bottom cradle, each holding a roll and a carriage
disposed below the bottom cradle and moveable transversely
thereto. The cradles are moved in and out of the rolling mill
housing transversely by the carriage. The problems of prior art piercing mills involving
excessive downtime for roll gorge adjustment and/or for feed
angle adjustment are solved by the present invention. In
addition, the present invention provides a vertical piercing
mill or elongator mill in which roll changes can be made with
a minimum of lost production time and manpower. The
invention also provides means for quickly changing worn
stationary guide shoes or guide discs.Still further, the present invention provides a
cone type piercer or elongator mill of compact and economical
design in which the conventional mill cap and associated
equipment are eliminated. Thus, the present invention
reduces downtime significantly over prior art
piercing/elongator mills so
