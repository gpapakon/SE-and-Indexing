<ABSTRACT>
A driving apparatus of a plasma display panel in 
which the writing cycle of the pixel data is short. A 

pixel data pulse (DP1) of a predetermined polarity is 
applied to column electrodes in accordance with pixel 

data, and scan pulses (SP) of a polarity opposite to the 
predetermined polarity are added to a maintenance pulse 

train in an interval between maintenance pulses (IA) of 
the same polarity as that of the pixel data pulse and 

the maintenance pulse train is applied to row 
electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a driving apparatus for a 
plasma display panel. As is well known, various studies are being made 
recently of plasma displays which are two-dimensional 
image displays of the flat panel type. A plasma display 
panel of the AC discharge type matrix system having a 
memory function is one known type. In a driving apparatus of the conventional plasma 
display panel, since the discharge is caused only at a 
row of display cells to which a scan pulse is applied, 
it is necessary to limit a period of time to apply a 
pixel data pulse, therefore, there is a problem that a 
relatively long period is needed to write image data. The invention is made to solve such a problem and 
it is an object of the invention to provide a driving 
apparatus of a plasma display panel in which the period 
of each cycle to write pixel data is reduced without 
reducing the pulse widths of the scan pulse and 
maintenance pulse. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a driving apparatus of a plasma display panel 
of the AC discharge type matrix system comprising a 
plurality of row electrode pairs arranged so that every 
two row electrodes make a pair and a plurality of column 
electrodes arranged in the direction which crosses 
perpendicularly to the row electrode pairs, wherein the 
driving apparatus comprises: pixel data pulse generating 
means for applying a pixel data pulse of a predetermined 
polarity to the column electrode in accordance with 
pixel data; and electrode driving means for adding a 
scan pulse having a polarity opposite to the 
predetermined polarity in an interval between 
maintenance pulses of the same polarity as the  
 
predetermined polarity and for applying to the row 
electrode pairs. The pixel data pulse of the predetermined polarity 
is applied to the column electrode in accordance with 
the pixel data, the scan pulse of the polarity opposite 
to the predetermined polarity is added for an interval 
between the maintenance pulses of the same polarity as 
that of the pixel data pulse and is applied to the row 
electrodes. Embodiments of the invention will now be described 
by way of example only and with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a diagram showing the construction of a 
display apparatus including a plasma display panel; Fig. 2 is an operation wave form diagram according 
to a driving apparatus of a conventional plasma display 
panel; Figs. 3 and 4 are diagrams showing the 
construction of a driving apparatus of a plasma display
