<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a superconductor having a silver sheath, fusing and thus a reduction in the superconductor material in the silver sheath is reduced or prevented by heat treatments being carried out under an oxygen partial pressure below 10 mbar and, preferably, using an insulating material having more than 60% of aluminium oxide in the insulating fibres. This makes it possible to produce greater lengths of fault-free composite conductors composed of superconductor material containing the phase which comprises two copper oxide planes, employing Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O phases.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the heat-treatment of high-temperature
superconductors (HTSCs) of the

Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system, in which an HTSC material is
arranged as a powder in a tube made of silver or a

silver alloy and, in this condition, annealed at a
temperature of between 840 and 870Â°C under an oxygen

partial pressure, characterized in that the oxygen
partial pressure is set to between 0.01 and 5 mbar.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the oxygen partial pressure is set to between 0.01

and 0.1 mbar.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, subsequent to the heat-treatment at low oxygen

partial pressure, slow annealing is carried at a
substantially higher oxygen partial pressure.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the oxygen partial pressure during the heat-treatment

is kept constant by controlling the
proportion of oxygen in the gas mixture supplied.
Process according to Claim 1 or 3,
characterized in that, in order to compensate for the

liberation of oxygen from the superconductor material
during the heat-treatment, a flushing gas with an

oxygen-reducing element is additionally passed over the
superconductor material. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in
that hydrogen is added as the oxygen-reducing element

in the flushing gas.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, prior to the heat-treatment, the tube is provided

with insulation which consists of fibres whose material
is made to more than 60% from Al
