Process for testing terminal resistances of 
signalling lines between emitters and receivers in networks 

constructed with ECL logic components utilizing the 
boundary scan cells integrated in the components for 

testing purposes, characterized in that all the signalling 
lines (S) of the networks to be tested are set to 

logical zero and the terminal voltages at the terminal 
resistances (R
L
) are increased until a logical 1 appears 
in the boundary scan input cells (SRE) when the terminal 

resistances (R
L
) are present and intact when the external 
test mode of the boundary scan test procedure is applied, 

and in that the voltages of the terminal resistances (R) 
of the boundary scan lines are independent of the terminal 

voltages (VEE2) of the networks to be tested. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the terminal voltage of the boundary scan lines is 

generated by means of a voltage divider (R
1
, R
2
) which has 
80 ohms against 0 volts and 130 ohms against 5.2 volts. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the terminal resistances (R) of the boundary scan 

line are operated with a separate terminal voltage.

to a receiver input from the test data output line (TDO) 

to the test data input lines (TDI) are operated in a
