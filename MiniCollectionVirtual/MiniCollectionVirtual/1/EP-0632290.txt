<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus has an optical probe head (3) with a radiation source (17) as well as a sensor (21). The probe head (3) transmits a signal towards a background (9, 14), for example a wash basin or a hand, and receives signals (11) reflected diffusely on this background. The received signals (11) are fed to control electronics (22) in order to control, for example, a valve (5). The apparatus is accommodated, for example, in the water outlets (2) of a washing stand fitting.

Arrangement for the non-contact control of the
water flow in a sanitary installation, especially a

washing, urinal or WC installation, having an optical
sensing head (3), which has a radiation source (17) and

a sensor (21), sends out signals directed towards a
background (9, 14) and picks up signals (11) reflected

diffusely at the background (9, 14) and feeds the said
signals to an electronic control unit (22) for

controlling, for example, a valve (5) arranged in a
water conduit (4), characterized in that the radiation

source (17) is connected to the electronic control unit
(22), and the radiated power of the radiation source

(17) can be varied by the electronic control unit (22),
in ord
er to determine the minimum detectable power of
the radiation source (17) needed in order to detect an

object (12, 14), and in that, by means of the
electronic control unit (22), this minimum radiated

power is caused to track the reflection properties of
the object (9, 14).
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the electronic control unit has a

microprocessor.
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the electronic control unit (22)

evaluates changes in the detectable power (IA) in order
to control the valve (5).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the electronic control unit (22) 

adjusts the detectable power by means of an
approximation method.
Arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the method is a successive approximation

method.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the sensing head (3) sends and

receives signals in the near infrared range.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the sensing head (3) has a high-aperture

receiving lens (15), and in that the radiation
source (17) is arranged in a hole (16) in the receiving

lens (15).
Arrangement according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the sensor (21) is arranged behind the

receiving lens (15) coaxially with the latter.
Arrangement according to Claim 8, characterized
in that the sensor (21) is arranged in front of a

mirror (19).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the radiation source (17) is an

infrared LED and the sensor (21) is a photodiode.
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 10,
characterized in that a threshold value amplifier (23)

is connected downstream of the sensor (21).
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 11,
characterized in that the signals have a transmitted

pulse width of a few microseconds, for example five
microseconds.
Method of operating an arrangement according to
one of Claims 1 to 12, characterized in that the power

needed for the detection or non-detection of a
background (9, 14) is measured.
Method according to Claim 13, characterized in
that the power needed for the detection or non-detection

of a background (9, 14) is expanded by a
predefined tolerance band (T) and is stored.
Method according to Claim 13 or 14,
characterized in that at predetermined time intervals, 

and using at least two transmitted pulses in each case,
a check is made to ascertain whether the reflection

from the background (9, 14) lies within a stored
tolerance band (T).
Method according to Claim 15, characterized in
that when the reflection lies within the stored

tolerance band (T), the arrangement is switched over
into a "sleep mode", and in that in the other case a

signal evaluation is carried out in order to detect the
object.
Wash-stand fitting with an arrangement
according to Claim 1, characterized in that the sensing

head (3) is fitted close to an outlet nozzle (1) on the
water outlet (2), and in that this sensing head (3)

contains the radiation source (17), a receiving lens
(15) and the sensor (21) in a coaxial arrangement, and

in that the radiation source (17) radiates
approximately parallel to the emerging water jet.
