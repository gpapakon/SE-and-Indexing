<ABSTRACT>
Each unit cell (10) of a flash EEPROM array (50) 
includes a control gate (38) having a section (38b) 

disposed in series between a program section (34a) of a 
floating gate (34) and a source (18) to provide threshold 

voltage control for erasure. The floating gate (34) 
further has an erase section (34b) which extends from the 

program section (34a) around an end of a channel (22) to 
the source (18). A thin tunnel oxide layer (32) is formed 

between an end portion (34c) of the erase section (34b) and 
an underlying portion of the source (18) which enables the 

floating gate (34) to be erased by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling 
from the end portion (34c) through the oxide layer (32) 

to the source (18) with low applied voltages.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to the art of 
semiconductor memories, and more specifically to a flash or 
block erase electrically erasable programmable read-only 
memory (EEPROM) cell and array which are controllably 
erasable with low applied voltages. A flash or block erase EEPROM semiconductor memory 
includes an array of cells which can be independently 
programmed and read. The size of each cell and thereby the 
memory are made small by omitting select transistors which 
would enable the cells to be erased independently. All of 
the cells are erased together as a block. A conventional flash EEPROM is described in an article 
entitled "A FLASH-ERASE EEPROM CELL WITH AN ASYMMETRIC 
SOURCE AND DRAIN STRUCTURE", by H. Kume et al, IEDM, 25.8, 
1987, pp. 560-563. Each cell includes a source and a drain 
which are formed on opposite sides of a channel region in 
a substrate. A thin tunnel oxide layer, a floating gate, 
a thick gate oxide layer and a control gate are formed over 
the channel region. The cell is programmed by applying, typically, 12V to 
the control gate, 6V to the drain and grounding the source,  
 
which causes hot electrons to be injected from the drain 
depletion region into the floating gate. Upon removal of 
the programming voltages, the injected electrons are 
trapped in the floating gate and create a negative charge 
therein which increases the threshold voltage of the cell 
to a value in excess of approximately 6V. The cell is read by applying 5V to the control gate 
and 1V to the drain, and sensing the impedance of the cell 
at the source. If the cell is programmed and the threshold 
voltage (6V) is higher than the control gate voltage (5V), 
the control gate voltage will be insufficient to enhance 
the channel and the cell will appear as a high impedance. 
If the cell is not programmed or erased, the threshold 
voltage will be low, the control gate voltage will enhance 
the channel and the cell will appear as a low impedance. The cell is erased by applying typically 12V to the 
source, grounding the control gate and allowing the drain 
to float. This causes the electrons which were injected 
into the floating gate during programming to be removed by 
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from the floating gate through 
the thin tunnel oxide layer to the source. A problem with the conventional flash EEPROM cell 
configuration is that due to manufacturing tolerances, some 
cells become over-erased before other cells become erased 
sufficiently. The floating gates of the over-erased
