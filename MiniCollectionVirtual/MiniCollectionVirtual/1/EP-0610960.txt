<ABSTRACT>
This method provides methods for producing a high-molecular 
weight polycarbodiimide solution from an organic diisocyanate in 

the presence of a carbodiimidation catalyst, wherein an alicyclic 
ether is used as a solvent. This invention also provides 

a polycarbodiimide solution with excellent stability in 
preservation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polycarbodiimide 
solution and a methods for producing the same, and 
particularly, to a high-molecular weight polycarbodiimide 
solution with excellent stability in preservation which can be 
obtained by appropriately choicing reaction conditions such as 
a solvent used in the production of the solution, and to a 
method for producing said polycarbodiimide solution. It is known that polycarbodiimides, particularly aromatic 
polycarbodiimides, have a high level of heat resistance, and 
such polycarbodiimides are therefore used as thermosetting 
resin materials for molding which are hot-pressed in a powder 
form. A method for producing said polycarbodiimides is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 51-61599, and other 
methods are reported in D. J. Lyman et al., Die Makromol. 
Chem., 67, 1 (1963) and E. Dyer et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 
80, 5495 (1958). Each of these methods uses, as a  
 
polymerization solvent, a hydrocarbon such as benzene, xylene, 
decalin, toluene or the like, or, o-dichlorobenzene, 
chlorobenzene, cyclohexanone, a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide 
and chlorobenzene (1 : 1), N-methylpyrrolidone or the like, 
and uses as a monomer, one of various organic diisocyanates 
such as 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, tolylene 
diisocyanate and the like or mixtures thereof, in a 
concentration within the range of 10 to 25% by weight. Since the polycarbodiimides obtained by the production 
methods mentioned in the above documents are powdery, and the 
films also mentioned in the above documents are produced by 
extracting the polycarbodiimides from the reaction system 
after 10 minutes from the start of reaction and then casting 
it. And moreover, since gelation or precipitation occurs in 
the reaction system over 10 minutes after the start of the 
above reaction, the polycarbodiimides thus obtained cannot be 
used in the form of a stable solution. Namely, high-molecular 
weight polycarbodiimide solutions having excellent 
stability cannot be obtained by the above methods. Another method for producing polycarbodiimides is a 
method in which the terminal isocyanate groups are sealed. 
L. M. Alberino et al., J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 21, 1999 (1977) 
and T. W. Campbell, J. Org. Chem., 28, 2069 (1963) also show 
methods for producing polycarbodiimides from organic  
 
diisocyanates in which the molecular weight of the 
polycarbodiimides produced is controlled by adding the organic 
monoisocyanate to the reaction system. In any one of these 
production methods,
