<ABSTRACT>
A novel compound of the formula 

wherein Ar represents a tetracyclic fused heterocyclic 
group which may be substituted; RÂ¹ represents H or a 

hydrocarbon group which may be substituted; Y 
represents an amino or nitrogen-containing saturated 

heterocyclic group which may be substituted, its salt, 
inhibiting excellent cholinesterase inhibitory activity 

and monoamine uptake inhibitory activity, thus being 
useful as therapeutic and/or prophylactic medicaments 

of senile dementia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medicine and more
particularly to a cholinesterase inhibitor composition,
inter alia a therapeutic and/or prophylactic drug for
senile dementia and symptoms of senile dementia in
Altzheimer's and other diseases, a novel tetracyclic
fused heterocyclic derivative or a salt thereof for use
as its active ingredient, and processes for its
production.With an increasing mean age of the population, a
variety of compounds having therapeutic and/or prophylactic
effects on senile dementia have so far been proposed.
Among them, tacrine (THA) and physostigmine,
both of which are inhibitors of cholinesterase, have
been found to have anti-senile dementia activity [cf.
International Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, Therapy
and Toxicology, Vol. 29, No. 1, p. 23-37, 1991, etc.].
However, severe hepatic impairment is often associated
with THA, while physostigmine has the drawback of a
short duration of action and a high toxic potential.Meanwhile, naturally-occurring ergot alkaloids are
known to be tetracyclic fused heterocyclic compounds
having an (iso)indole ring. Particularly as to
dihydroergotoxine and nicergoline, their potential
utility as therapeutic agents for senile dementia has
been explored (Z. REHACEK and P. SAJDL., "Bioactive
Molecules. vol. 12 : ERGOT ALKALOIDS", ELSVIER, 1990,
p. 74). 
However, there is no disclosure, nor a suggestion,
in the literature about cholinesterase inhibitory
activity in these compounds.Meanwhile, as synthetic versions, a variety of
bicyclic or tricyclic fused heterocyclic compounds each
having a (dihydro)indole ring have been proposed as
inhibitors of cholinesterase (JP-A-4(1992)-234845, JP-A-5(1993)-140149,
WO9307140 and 9312085, and EP560235
and 562832).JP-A-4(1992)-234845 discloses a tricyclic
cyclicamine compound of the formula
 
[wherein P represents an N-substituted piperidin-1-yl
(N-substituted piperazin-1-yl)methyl group or the like;
G represents carbon or nitrogen; E represents carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur; ring A represents an
aromatic ring such as benzene, pyridine, thiophene or
the like] and a pharmaceutical composition comprising
the same compound as an active ingredient.It is described there that compounds of formula
[I] having the above ABD ring system, which includes
such species as 1H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]indol-1-one,
cyclopento[d]indol-3-one,
cyclopento[b](benzo[b]thieno)-1-one, 1H-pyrrolo[1,2-a](6-azaindol)-1-one,
pyrrolo[1,2-a](thieno[2,3-b]pyrrol)-1-one,
etc., have cholinesterase inhibitory
activity and a pharmaceutical composition
