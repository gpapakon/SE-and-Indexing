<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for nitrating toluene to produce dinitrotoluene characterized by a liquid phase nitration characterized in that reaction of anhydrous nitric acid with toluene in a reactor at a reaction temperature of between 20  DEG C and 30 DEG C for a reaction time of less than 15 minutes, said reaction employing a molar ratio of nitric acid plus any water to toluene of between 10:1 and 15:1, said reaction being conducted in the absence of sulfuric acid, and in the absence of any aprotic dipolar solvent during the reaction and in the absence of any aprotic dipolar solvent to halt the reaction, to produce said dinitrotoluene in a product mixture that is free of nitrocresol, followed by vacuum distillation of the product mixture, in the absence of any aprotic dipolar solvent, to remove unreacted nitric acid from said product mixture thereby providing said dinitrotoluene.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PC./USM/0508,-1-PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF DINITROTOLUENEThis invention relates generally to aromatic nitration reactions and, more specifically, to a process for nitrating toluene to dinitrotoluene.Nitration reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons are generally conducted in mixed acid systems, such as mixed nitric and sulfuric acids. However, these mixed acid systems usually involve reconcentration of the spent sulfuric acid after the nitration reaction. This reconcentration step is time consuming, energy intensive and requires the use of expensive materials of construction. In addition, the use of sulfuric acid tends to result in significant nitrocreosol and cyanide by-product formation which requires expensive waste-water treatment to remove. In view of these disadvantages associated with mixed nitric/sulfuric acid systems, there have been recent attempts to perform gas phase or liquid phase nitrations in concentrated nitric acid in the absence of sulfuric acid. By way of illustration, U.S. Patent No. 4,064,147 discloses the preparation of aromatic mononitro compounds (such as mononitrobenzene) by a liquid phase reaction with nitric acid having an acid concentration of between 70 percent and 100 percent by weight using a reaction temperature of between 0°C and 80°C. When employing a relatively reactive compound such as benzene or toluene as a starting material, this patent teaches that a nitric acid concentration of between 70 and 90 percent by weight is preferred. The 

disclosure of this patent requires a ratio of nitric acid plus water to organic components of not below 3 when using 70 percent nitric acid, and not below 8 when using 100 percent nitric acid. As another illustration, U.S. Patent 3,928,395 discloses the use of concentrated nitric acid to nitrate aromatic compounds optionally in the presence of a dipolar aprotic solvent that is inert towards the nitrating agent. The patent requires that reaction be halted by diluting the resulting mixture with a dipolar aprotic solvent after the desired degree of nitration has been reached. Unfortunately, the use of such solvents either throughout the reaction or to halt the reaction tends to cause environmental waste disposal problems and waste stream handling problems.Since dinitrotoluene is useful as an intermediate in producing TDI, new processes for the selective manufacture of this intermediate while avoiding the above mentioned problems would be highly desirable to the polyisocyanate manufacturing community.The present invention relates to a
