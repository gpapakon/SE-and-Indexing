<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICAL DOPPLER VELOCIMETER Background of the Invention This invention relates to optical Doppler velocimeters; and more particularly to extremely compact, highly portable, rugged, eye-safe velocimeters. Prior art optical Doppler velocimeters comprise discrete lasers as optical sources and discrete optical components for internal handling of the beam, reflections, and reference signals. Since such systems impose strict requirements for critical alignment of optical components, they suffer degradation with both physical vibration and temperature change. Although optical fibers have been employed as portions of very low power, short range prior art systems, the use of fibers therein, to date, has not reduced the strict alignment requirements of the resulting systems and the concomitant difficulties remain as problems.Optical Doppler velocimeters, as a design choice, either transmit a continuous or a pulsed beam of light. Continuous beam systems, by their very nature, produce very low power transmitted beams which limits investigations to controlled environments. In the case of prior art pulsed beam systems, short duration, high power pulses with steep edge transitions are formed by Q-switching of a light source laser. Although high transmitted power permits operation in less controlled environments, the resulting light pulses comprise extremely wideband signals which decrease detection sensitivity and increase signal processing requirements.Summary of the Invention In accordance with the present invention, fiber optics are used exclusively within a velocimeter for generation and handling of all optical signals. While retaining sufficient energy in the transmitted beam to achieve a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio in the received reflected signal, nonÂ¬ linear optical effects within the fibers are avoided by use of long-duration, relatively low power pulses.Advantageously, optical Doppler velocimeters constructed in accordance with the present invention are: extremely compact, 

 essentially eye-safe, light weight units which are rugged and are essentially free of vibration and temperature effects.In accordance with the present invention, an optical Doppler velocimeter comprises: a source of optical radiation which has an optical fiber output port; a bi-directional optical transmitter-receiver (telescope) comprising: an optical input-output port for transmitting a beam of radiation to be scattered at a predetermined location and for collecting a portion of the scattered radiation; and an optical fiber
