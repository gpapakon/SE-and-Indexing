<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to alkaloids, and especially to bisbenzylisoquinoline 
alkaloids, and derivatives thereof. It has been known for some time that Amerindian peoples of the Rupununi area 
of Guyana, South America chew the nuts of the greenheart tree (Ocotea rodiaei) as a 
crude form of contraception. Also, infusions of the bark of the greenheart tree have 
been used as a febrifuge and as an anti-periodic in fevers. Some bisbenzylisoquinoline 
alkaloids from other plants are known to have similar uses. and it was considered 
possible that the activity of the greenheart tree was attributable to a bisbenzylisoquinoline 
alkaloid. Although bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids have been extracted from the 
greenheart tree. no biological activity had previously been reported for such alkaloids. We have now isolated an active bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid which we have 
named rupununine C₃₇H₄₀O₆N₂ which has now been characterised. as in Formula I. 
The isolated compound had OR₁ and OR₂ one as a hydroxy group the other as a 
methoxy group, not distinguished in the mass spectrograph. The structure of the rupununines of the invention is as follows: 
   wherein R = -H or -CH₃, R₁ and R₂ are optional derivatisations the same or 
different and are thus for example -H, alkyl, especially -CH₃, acyl or glycosidyl. The 
nitrogens may of course be quaternised and in such form are regarded as within the 
above formulae. Rupununine is a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid. Related alkaloids not forming 
part of the invention, include tertiary alkaloids such as curine and isochondrodendrin. 
Many tertiary alkaloids of this series show biological properties. For example, 
thalicarpine (isolated from Thalictrum dasycarpum) is a hypotensive and cytotoxic agent. 
Cissampereine (isolated from Cissampelospareira) exhibits cytotoxic action and 
tetrandrine (isolated from Cyclea peltata) is known to be a tumour-inhibitory alkaloid. Although the greenheart tree (Octotea rodiaei) has been reported to be a source of 
d-curine, no biological activity has been reported of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids from 
this plant. However it is known that amongst the Wapishana tribe of the Rupununi area 
of Guyana, the seeds (or fruits) of this tree have been used as a form of oral 
contraceptive. The fact that the alkaloids rodiasine, sepeerine, ocotine, ocotosine, 
demerarine, dirosine, norrodiasine and 2(+)- nortetrandrine have been isolated from the 
bark and seeds of this tree. brought speculation as to the possible biological properties 
existing
