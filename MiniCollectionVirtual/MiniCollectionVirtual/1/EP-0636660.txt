<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to curable compositions,
especially coating compositions.Curable compositions based on polyisocyanates for
coating and/or molding are well-known in the art. They provide a
number of desirable characteristics such as resistance to
solvent, salt, and other types of environmental attack.However, these compositions suffer some disadvantages.
Polyisocyanates can be highly difficult to handle. The NCO
groups on the polyisocyanate are highly reactive, so they must be
chemically blocked if it is desired to use the polyisocyanate in
a one-pack curable composition. The use of chemical blocking
groups further increases the expense of the material, results in
increased VOC during cure, introduces an additional component
into the composition that can have the potential for adverse
side-effects such as yellowing, and necessitates a high heat
curing temperature on the order of 150Â°C. If the NCO groups are
not chemically blocked, the polyisocyanate must be utilized as
one part of a two-pack curable composition. With such a
composition, the highly-reactive polyisocyanate must be kept
isolated from the surrounding environment and from the other
component(s) of the composition until just before application to
a substrate or mold, further increasing the expense and
complexity of the process.It has thus long been desired to produce a composition
that exhibits the advantages of polyisocyanate-based curable
compositions having an optimum mix of characteristics as
described above, but without having to use NCO groups as the
functional groups for the curing reaction.According to the present invention, there is provided a
curable composition comprising: 
(A) carbamate-functional compound that is the reaction
product of a mixture comprising:
(1) a monomeric polyisocyanate or an adduct thereof with
a compound having a group that is reactive with
isocyanate and also a functional group selected from
carboxyl or epoxy, and(2) a compound comprising a group that is reactive with
said monomeric isocyanate or with the carboxyl or
epoxy group of said adduct and a carbamate group or
group that can be converted to carbamate, and(B) a compound having a plurality of functional groups
that are reactive with carbamate groups on said
carbamate-functional compound.These curable compositions may be used for a
variety of applications, such as coatings, castings, and
moldings. When used for coatings, for example, they
provide durable hard coatings exhibiting many of the above
desirable characteristics for exterior coatings,
