<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process of preparing granules 
involving first preparing a carrier comprising diluent, 

binder, and optionally a disintegrating agent. In a 
container separate from said carrier, a steroid, lubricant 

and, optionally, an antioxidant are dissolved in 
an, optionally pre-heated, organic solvent. The resulting 

solution is added to the carrier contained within 
an, e.g vacuum mixer, followed by further blending of 

the mixture. The organic solvent is removed from the 
mixture. The mixture is blended further to form granules. 

The process may further include incorporating a 
flow enhancer such as colloidal silicon dioxide into the 

granules. A granule for making a pharmaceutical dosage 
unit is granule characterized in comprising: a) a carrier 

comprising diluent and binder, and b) a film coating 
said carrier, said film comprising desogestrel and a 

lubricant, and has the characteristic of by retaining 
90% of the desogestrel at a pressure of 150 mbar and at 

a temperature of 70° C over 72 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions
generally, and more specifically to pharmaceutical
granulates and processes for making them.Methods for making tablets and other solid or dry
pharmaceutical preparations are well-known. For example
in the standard text Gennaro et al., Remington's Pharmaceutical
Sciences, pp. 1633 - 1665 (18th ed. 1980, Mack
Publ. Co. of Easton, PA, U.S.A.) ("Remington's"),
methods of making tablets, capsules and pills and their
respective components are described. Three methods of
making tablets include the "wet-granulation", "dry-granulation",
and direct compression methods.Wet-granulation methods involve weighing out ingredients
(including a solvent), mixing them, granulating
them, screening them damp, drying them, dry screening,
lubricating, and compressing the resultant admixture
into tablets. See, e.g. Belgian Patent No. 773,064. Such
procedures generally result in tablets having adequate
tablet homogeneity.While granules made according to these methods are
adequate for many medicinal agents, they are not altogether
adequate for use with certain medicinal agents
and applications (e. g. for making tablets containing
low doses of very potent steroids).It has been found that certain steroids such as
desogestrel transfer from tablets into the surrounding
local environment. If the transfer of the steroid from
the tablet cannot be prevented, the quantity of steroid
contained within the dosage unit may drop below stated
levels within a relatively short period of time.In the present invention a simple inexpensive and
unobvious new solution is provided for this problem.
When both the steroid and a lubricant are dissoluted in
an organic solvent, the granulate which can be prepared
comprises a film coating (or matrix) consisting of said 
steroid and the lubricant. Surprisingly this film
coating prevents the migration. For desogestrel very
good results are obtained when stearic acid is applied
as lubricant. The advantages of granules of this new
type (non-migration granules) are clear, and such
granules can easily be discerned from regular granules
known in the art by measuring the migration properties
of desogestrel from said granules.The invention further includes a process of
preparing granules which, among other things, display
the ability to retain compounds such as desogestrel even
under extreme conditions. The process involves first
mixing a carrier comprising diluent, binder, and
optionally a disintegrating agent. The carrier may be
prepared in a mixer or

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing steroid loaded granules
comprising:


a) dissolving a steroid and a lubricant in a
sufficient amount of an organic solvent to form a

solution;
b) mixing the solution with a carrier comprising
diluent and binder thus forming a mixture of

solution and carrier; and
c) removing the organic solvent from the mixture
while blending the mixture to form steroid loaded

granules.
The process according to claim 1 wherein said organic
solvent is removed in a vacuum mixer.
The process according to claim 1 or 2 wherein said
steroid is desogestrel.
The process according to any one of claims 1-3
wherein said lubricant is stearic acid.
A granule for making a pharmaceutical dosage unit,
obtainable by the process of claim 1, characterized

in that it contains a film coating comprising a
steroid and a lubricant.
The granule of claim 5, characterized by comprising
desogestrel and stearic acid, and further

characterized by retaining 90% of the desogestrel
within said granule at a pressure of 150 mbar and at

a temperature of 70° C over 72 hours.
The granule of claim 5 or 6, characterized by
comprising:


a) a carrier comprising lactose,
polyvinylpyrrolidone, and disintegrating agent; and
b) a film coating said carrier, said film comprising
desogestrel and stearic acid.
