<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a surgical instrument (1) for 
treating fractures and pseudoarthrosis of the carpal 

scaphoid, comprising means (7,12) for grasping and compressing 
the bone and equipped with at least one hollow rod (25) 

which oscillates and can be positioned at different 
angles, said hollow rod (25) having the lower extremity 

(27) engaging a hole (28) corresponding to a grasping 
element (7) and defining a channel for the passage of some 

instruments for operating on the bone.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of surgical
instruments, with particular reference to a
reduction-syndesis forceps for treating factures or
pseudoarthrosis of the carpal scaphoid. The document U.S.-A-2 434 431, which corresponds to the
preamble of claim 1, describes a surgical instrument for
inserting Kirschner wire or metallic pins through fractured
bones. It is particularly suitable in treating the fractured
mandible or jaw bones. An instrument of this kind has a
supporting structure comprising a pair of parallel shafts
connected by a first arm or plate shaped element and a
second arm or plate shaped element each provided with
functional means, and where said first and second plate
shaped elements are perpendicular to said shafts and parallel
to each other. However this known instrument is not suitable
for treating a bone which is located inside a cavity or
articulation, such as a scaphoid bone. The scaphoid is one of the most important bones
involving articulation and mobility of the hand.In the presence of fractures of this bone, which
is situated in an anatomically complex and difficult
position for reducing fractures, there are serious
problems mainly concerning grasping and compression of
the bone and its surgical treatment, particularly as 
regards joining together the two parts divided by the
fracture, with emphasis on the problems of
vascularization of the bones.A previous proposal was the instrument designed
and used by Timothy Herbert, which consists
substantially of a hook-type forceps operating on the
longitudinal axis of the scaphoid, in which the hook
itself is able to move longitudinally to enable
compression of the bone.Subsequently, special instruments are used to make
a hole through the two parts of the fractured bone,
which are stabilized by means of a connecting screw.
This method, however, involves excessive risk of
devascularization of the bone. This problem is further
accentuated in the presence of unstable fractures.Last but not least is an inconvenience of equal
importance and gravity. Sometimes the reduction takes
place incorrectly because the screw is almost tangent
to the anterior wall of the bone, which obviously
reduced stability and duration of the reduction.The aim of this invention is to obviate these
inconveniences by solving the problems in an original
new way.To this end, the invention relates to an
instrument in accordance with Claim 1). Further details of this invention will become more
evident if reference is made to the attached diagram,

<CLAIMS>
A surgical instrument for treating fractures and pseudo-arthritis
of the carpal scaphoid, comprising a supporting

structure made up of a pair of parallel shafts (2,3) connected
together by a first plate element (4) and a second

plate element (5)
in which the first and second plate elements are perpendicular

to said shafts and parallel to each other, characterised by
the fact that:


said parallel shafts (2,3) are longitudinally hollow;
said first plate element (4) is 
U
 shaped with an upper
portion and a lower portion parallel to each other, perpendicular

to the hollow shafts and secured
to said shafts;
said second plate element (5) is positioned
below the first plate element and is provided at one free

end with grasping teeth (7) around a hole (28), the
grasping teeth facing downwards from the opposite side to

the first plate element;
inside each of the hollow shafts (2,3) is housed a telescopically
movable rod (8,9) projecting below from the

shaft, to said moving rods being secured a third plate 
element (11) positioned below and parallel to the second

plate element, said third plate elements being provided
with a hook-shaped terminal portion (12) opposite the

grasping teeth (7) of said second plate element;
said first plate element (4) carries at least one hollow
rod (25) which can be moved for parallel or angled positioning

with respect to said hollow shafts, said hollow rod
(25) having a lower extremity (27) engaging the hole (28)

at the level of the grasping teeth (7) of said second plate
element and defining a channel for the passage of instruments

for operating on the bone.
A surgical instrument as defined in claim 1, wherein one of
said rods (9) extending into one of said shafts (3) is

partially threaded and engages a threaded drive element (10)
for translation of third plate element (11) towards and away

from the second plate element.
A surgical instrument as defined in claims 1 and 2,
wherein one calibrated fixed plate (13) placed parallel

to said shafts (8,9) and a reference (14) on one of said
shafts (8,9) form a means for measuring the size of the bone.
A surgical instrument as defined in any preceding claim,
wherein the upper and lower portions of the first 
U

shaped plate element (4) are each provided with a slot
(17,18) and has said slots are aligned on an axis parallel to

said hollow shafts, wherein a plate (19) with a hole (21) and 
a slot (22) is guided and moves on the upper portion of said

first plate element, said hole and slot of said plate (19)
collimating with the slot of said upper portion, wherein the

hollow rod (25) extends from above in said hole

(21) of the plate and in the aligned slots of the upper and
lower portions of said first plate element, and has its lower

extremity inserted in the hole of said second element, said
hollow rod (25) being angled following movement of the plate

(19) on the upper portion (15) of said first element (4), the
position of the plate being fixed by a screw (23) extending

in the coinciding slots (17,22) of said upper portion of
said first element and said plate and engaging a threaded ring nut

(24).
