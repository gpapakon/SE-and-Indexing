<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method of
application of adherent protective coatings of refractory
material to the surface of substrates of components of
electrolytic cells for molten salt electrolysis for the
electrowinning of metals and operating at high
temperatures, particularly for the production of aluminium
and as well to novel designs of such cells and their
operation.Generally, the invention relates to the development
of a coating technology to apply different compositions of
refractory materials such as those containing hard metals,
particularly titanium borides, metallic alloys,
intermetallic compounds, cermets, oxides, metals and
ceramics to the surface of substrates of components of
aluminium production cells made of different materials such
as carbonaceous materials, refractory materials, ceramics,
cermets, oxides, metallic alloys (particularly those of
iron, nickel, aluminum, and copper) and intermetallic
compounds.The protective coating is a refractory material or
a combination of refractory materials containing aluminum-wettable
hard metals, particularly titanium borides or
other materials consisting of metallic alloys,
intermetallic compounds, cermets, oxides and ceramics on
the surface of the substrates of electrolytic cell
components, in particular an adherent protective coating of 
aluminium-wettable refractory material on the surface of a
carbonaceous or refractory substrate lining the cell bottom
floor of an aluminium production cell.The invention also relates to composite materials
comprising a carbonaceous or refractory substrate coated
with an aluminium-wettable refractory material and to the
use of the coated composite materials in such cells.Among the metals obtained in electrolytic cells
operating at high temperature in a molten salt electrolyte
containing an oxide or compound of the metal to be
electrowon, aluminium is the most important and the
invention will describe in particular the protection of
components of aluminium cells, more particularly the
protection of the cell cathode bottom by applying an
aluminium wettable, adherent coating.Aluminium is produced conventionally by the Hall-Héroult
process, by the electrolysis of alumina dissolved
in molten salt containing cryolite at temperatures around
950°C. A Hall-Héroult reduction cell typically has a steel
shell provided with an insulating lining of refractory
material, which in turn has a lining of carbon which
contacts the molten constituents. Conductor bars connected
