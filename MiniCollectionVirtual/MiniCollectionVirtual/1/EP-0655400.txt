<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of tape cassettes (3) fed in succession from 
a conveyor (2) is oriented vertically on an end stretch 

(5) of the conveyor itself terminating at a position in 
side by side relation with a tiltable collection element 

(21). The cassettes (3) are pushed laterally from the 
end stretch (5) of the feed conveyor (2) for being 

loaded onto the collection element (21) until they form 
thereon a row (F) comprised of a given number of 

cassettes (3). The collection element (21) is then 
tilted to let the cassette row (F) fall onto a tray (29) 

previously positioned under the collection element (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for disposing magnetic tape cassettes in an orderly 
manner into respective housing trays, said apparatus 
being of the type comprising: a feed conveyor arranged 
to individually send a plurality of tape cassettes in 
succession, consecutively aligned in a common lying 
plane, to a transferring station; at least one housing 
tray designed to receive in engagement the tape 
cassettes arranged in parallel side by side rows and 
oriented according to respective vertical planes. It is known that in an audio and video magnetic tape 
cassette processing and packaging cycle, working steps 
are provided in which the cassettes coming in succession 
from a given work station moist be collected in an 
orderly manner in respective housing trays, by means of 
which trays said cassettes are easily carried to a next 
work station where they arc picked up again from the 
trays and submitted to further processes provided in the 
production cycle. For example, said orderly cassette collection in trays 
is usually carried out immediately after the operations 
for assembling the different parts forming the cassettes 
still devoid of the magnetic tape, for making it easier 
to transfer them to the work station where the tape will 
be wound into the cassettes. Likewise, the cassettes are collected in trays also 
after the magnetic tape winding steps, in order to 
enable them to be transferred to the stations where 
boxing and packaging operations are carried out. The foregoing being stated, in is pointed out that  
 
presently all operations necessary for storing the 
cassettes in trays are conducted in a completely manual 
manner. In fact, it is provided that the cassettes 
coming from a given work station be laid down on a belt 
conveyor, at the end of which an operator picks them up 
from the conveyor and puts them into the trays. It is 
well clear that this situation involves important labour 
expenses, also on account of the fact that modern 
automatic machines presently employed in the cassette 
packaging operations have such a productivity that in 
many cases the constant use of more than an operator is 
required. Therefore, this situation is unacceptable if compared 
with market requirements that are oriented towards a 
constant increase in productivity, together with a 
reduction in the manufacturing costs. An apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and a method according 
to the preamble of claim 14 is disclosed in EP-A-0 315 807. It is an object of
