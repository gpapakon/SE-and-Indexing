<ABSTRACT>
A process for the separation of taxanes, particularly taxol, cephalomanine, baccatin III and deacetylbaccatin III, from ornamental yew tissue is described. The process involves a specific solvent mixture in water and 50 to 95 percent by volume methanol, ethanol or acetone and treatment of the resulting extract using activated carbon, preferably charcoal. The taxanes are preferably separated from the crude extract by a normal phase chromatographic step which preferably is through vacuum and then medium pressure column, chromatographic separation, using inexpensive silica gel as an absorbent. The silica gel is regenerated by heating in a furnace above about 500  DEG C to remove adsorbed organic materials.

 P OCESS FOR THE ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION OF TAXOL AND TAXANES FROM TJUCOS sppCross-Reference to Related ApplicationThis application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/986,368, filed December 7, 1992. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(1) Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a process for the isolation and preferably purification of taxol and other taxanes from Taxuε spp plant material by using a particular combination of solvent extraction and preferably normal phase chromatographic purification which produces the taxanes in high yield and purity. The process is particularly characterized in the use of preliminary solvent extraction and purification steps which remove the desired taxanes from the plant material without the lipid and chlorophyll components which interfere with the chromatographic purification.(2) Description of the Prior ArtThe production of taxol from ornamental yew needles, barks and roots at present is not economical due to an extremely high percentage of unwanted impurities carried forward in the extract (40-50% by weight of the dried plant material) during the extraction. This unusually high percentage of impurities in the solvent extract of the needles of ornamental yew makes it very expensive and uneconomical to purify taxol and taxanes from this source in addition to the high cost in drying the needles. Published reports suggest that ornamental yew needles contain about 0.002 to 0.01% of taxol on a dry weight basis(Witherup, S., et al., Journal of Natural Products 53,1249-1255 (1990)). Organic solvent extraction of l kg of the dried ornamental yew needles will afford about 

450-500 g of the extract after removing the solvent (45- 50% to the biomass) by the published extraction methods using 95% ethanol in water.The prior art has described taxol and other taxanes isolated from the bark of Taxuε spp. which are useful as chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in the treatment of cancers. Illustrative are U.S. Patent No. 5,019,504 (1991) to Christen et al and WO 92/07842 (1992) to Rao et al. Christen et al describe a cell culture process using Taxuε brevifolia for producing the taxanes which are then separated by chromatography, by solvent extraction or adsorption methods. Culturing of plant cells is a difficult method for production of the taxanes for use on a large scale. Rao et al describe a process using reverse phase liquid chromatography. The plant material is extracted with a polar solvent, which is 95% by volume ethanol, for 24 hours at
