<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to high voltage circuits. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to high voltage circuits in an electronic 
erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) integrated circuit (IC). Metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) are manufactured 
such that they can withstand a particular maximum voltage across any two terminals 
of the MOSFET. A MOSFET having a maximum voltage of Vmax is "rated" at a 
voltage of Vmax. The maximum voltage of a MOSFET is termed the breakdown 
voltage of the MOSFET. A common MOSFET breakdown voltage is equal to 
approximately twelve volts. As the rated voltage of a MOSFET increases the 
associated expense in manufacturing the IC containing the MOSFET increases. The 
increase manufacturing expenses may be particularly acute with p-channel MOSFETs. 
For example, in order to manufacture an IC containing a p-channel MOSFETs rated 
at twenty-four volts, a significant increase in process technology and materials is 
required when compared to an IC containing only twelve volt rated p-channel 
MOSFETs. When operating an IC it is often necessary to apply a voltage greater than 
twelve volts to one or more MOSFETs in the IC. Typically, higher rated MOSFETs 
are used in ICs to which voltages greater than twelve volts are applied. However, as 
discussed above, the use of such higher rated MOSFETs are not always desirable since 
they are more difficult and more expensive to produce. One type of circuit which, for proper operation, requires a maximum voltage 
greater than twelve volts is an electronic erasable programmable read only memory 
(EEPROM) circuit. A general description of an EEPROM circuit 100 and how it 
operates is given below with reference to FIG. 1. The EEPROM circuit 100 includes an array of EEPROM cells 102, hereafter  
 
"memory cells". These memory cells 102 are non-volatile, that is, each memory cell 
102 can store a bit of data for ten years or more. In addition, these memory cells 102 
can be erased and programmed by a user. Typically, each memory cell includes a 
transistor. Nodes of the transistor are connected to a row line 104, a column line 108, 
an erase line 106, and a ground line 110. The operation of memory cell 102 will now 
be described with reference to FIG. 2, which shows one of the memory cells 102 in greater detail. In order to properly function, a memory cell 102 is typically erased, 
programmed and then read based on instructions output by a controlling processor (not 
shown). When
