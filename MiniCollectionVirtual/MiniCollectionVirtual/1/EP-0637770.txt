<ABSTRACT>
The pre-polygon scanning path length of a raster output scanning system is reduced 
by replacing a required cylinder lens, or lenses, with two cylindrical mirrors (30,32). One mirror 

with a negative, concave surface and a second positive cylindrical mirror. The first mirror (30) 
directs the light beam to the second mirror (32). The second mirror (32) directs the light onto 

the facets (18A) of a rotating polygon to form a focused beam in the vertical axis of the 
polygon. The function of the two cylindrical mirrors (30,32) is to act as a telephoto lens to 

properly focus the image of the laser at the polygon facet while reducing the total pre-polygon 
path length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a Raster Output Scanner (ROS) and, more
particularly, to a ROS having a compact optical system design.Printing systems utilizing lasers to reproduce information are well known in the art.
Typically, such systems include a laser for generating a laser beam, a modulator, such as an
acousto-optic modulator or laser diode driver electronics, for modulating the laser beam in
accordance with input information to be reproduced, a multifaceted polygon scanner for
scanning the modulated laser beam across a medium on a line to line basis, and various optical
components to focus and align the laser beam at the medium.In some printing systems it is required that a cylindrical lens be interposed between
the modulated laser beam and the polygon scanner to shape the laser beam to optically correct
for motor-polygon induced sagittal beam position errors, commonly referred to as wobble
errors. The optical system disclosed in U.S.-A-3,750,189 illustrates the general utility of such a
lens. The cylindrical lens is preferably aligned with the laser beam to redistribute the energy of
the modulated laser beam in a manner whereby the energy distribution of the laser beam
incident on the recording medium is substantially symmetrical about the start of scan and end
of scan positions of the medium, and focused to a small spot. This is particularly important in
those systems which utilize a xerographic recording medium.A compact design for the scanning optics of these prior art type of ROS printers is
desirable to make the machine itself as compact as possible and to enable extendability of the
same ROS design into many machine architectures.One well known technique is to introduce folding mirrors to fold the optical path
and allow the optical components to be positioned in a more compact area. Another concept
disclosed in U.S -A-5, 142,403, is to replace both a folding mirror and a cylindrical lens in the pre-polygon
optics with a single cylindrical mirror. This technique has been found useful for ROS
systems which utilize either an underfilled facet design; e.g. the light beam directed against
the rotating polygon illuminates only a portion of each facet or in an overfilled facet design;
e.g. the light beam directed against the rotating polygon completely illuminates each facet and
a portion of adjacent facets. Each design, overfilled and underfilled, has advantages and
disadvantages. One of the disadvantages of the overfilled design is that a longer pre-polygon
optical path is required to
