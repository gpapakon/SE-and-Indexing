<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for gathering enriched web server activity data in a global communications network in which requested information files are cached at a plurality of network devices. With the prevalence of web caching on the Internet, the origin web servers do not serve the majority of requests for web site content. A single pixel clear Graphics Image Format (GIF) request is added to the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) source file for a web page. Appended to the GIF request is a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) string of data that contains enhanced web activity data information, including the number of images ( hits") that have to be retrieved by a client browser to build the web page, and the referring identifier that resulted in access to the web page. The single pixel clear GIF request is not cacheable and results in the request being transmitted to the origin web server when the client browser interprets the HTML file. The enriched data is stored in log files at the origin web server to accumulate an accurate number of hits on the web page.

<DESCRIPTION>
 D E S C R I P T I O NGATHERING ENRICHED WEB SERVER ACTIVITY DATA OF CACHED WEB CONTENTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to client-server computer systems and, more specifically, to information access requests to a web site server over a global communications network.All web pages are written with HyperText Markup Language (HTML) . Hypertext and universality are two essential features of HTML. Hypertext means that a programmer can create a link on a web page that leads the visitor to any other web page or to practically anything else on the Internet. Hypertext enables information on the web to be accessed from many different directions. Universality means that because HTML documents are saved as ASCII or text only files, virtually any computer can read a web page. HTML lets the web designer format text, add graphics, sound, and video, and save it all in a text or an American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) file that any computer can read. The key to HTML is in the tags, which are key words enclosed between less than (<) and greater than (>) signs, that indicate the type of content coming up next. While practically any computer can display web pages, how those pages actually look depends on the type of computer, the monitor, the speed of the Internet connection, and the browser software used to view the page.Advanced web designers often use a scripting language called JavaScript and a system of naming parts of the web page called the document object model (DOM) , together with HTML to create 

dynamic content on a page. These effects are sometimes called dynamic HTML, or DHTML. HTML tags are commands written between angle brackets (< >) that indicate how the browser should display the text. Examples of HTML tags are BASE, FORM, FRAME, IMG and SCRIPT. There are opening and closing versions for many tags and the affected text is contained within the two tags. The opening and closing tags use the same command word; the closing tag carries an initial forward slash (/) symbol. Many tags have special attributes that offer a variety of options for the contained text. The attribute is entered between the command word and the final angle bracket . A series of attributes can be used in a single tag just by writing one after the other, in any order, with a space separating each one. The attributes in turn, often have values. In some cases, a selection of value is made from a small group of choices. Other attributes are more strict about the type of values they
