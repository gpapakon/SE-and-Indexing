<ABSTRACT>
In order to enrich natural gas or other hydrocarbon gases with hydrogen, thus reducing the carbon content and thereby achieving a reduction or elimination of the discharge of carbon dioxide during combustion of the gases, a pyrolytic process is conducted in the feed stream for the natural gases or hydrocarbon gases which are to be burned. The gas is passed through a reactor in which it is decomposed at least partially into a carbon constituent and a hydrogen constituent. The carbon constituent is removed to a desired level. Any remaining constituent together with the hydrogen constituent is conveyed to the combustion process while the removed carbon constituent is conveyed out of the process for separate application. The pyrolytic process can be carried out on the entire stream or only on a partial stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method for reducing the carbon content 
in a feed flow of natural gas or other hydrocarbon gases for a 
combustion process in order thereby to 
eliminate to the desired degree or at least to reduce the 
discharge of carbon dioxides in the combustion of the gas, e.g. 
in connection with a gas-fired power station. During the combustion of fossil fuels, coal, natural gas and 
other hydrocarbons, both water in the form of vapour and carbon 
dioxide will be found in the waste gases. The proportional 
incidence between these two gases will be dependent on the 
quantitive ratio of carbon to hydrogen in the fuel concerned. 
Coal will produce almost only carbon dioxide, methane will 
produce water and carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2:1, while 
hydrogen will only produce water. In the efforts to reduce the 
greenhouse effect, the discharges of carbon dioxide are 
becoming ever less acceptable. Thus it is vitally important to 
limit these discharges,the best best solution being to 
eliminate them entirely. The object of the present invention is to improve this 
situation by providing a method for reducing the carbon content 
of natural gas and hydrocarbon gas. This reduction should be 
capable of being implemented in such a manner that a desired 
degree of reduction of the CO2 content can be achieved after a 
combustion. The reduction can extend all 
the way through to the use of pure hydrogen as a fuel, thus 
completely avoiding the discharges of CO2. Thus a further object of the invention is also to make it 
possible for natural gas to be used as a fuel with a greatly 
reduced production of carbon dioxide, e.g. in a gas turbine. These objects are achieved by a method which according to the 
invention is characterized by the features in the claims 
presented. From DD-A-211 457 is known a method and an apparatus 
for the production of carbon black and hydrogen in a 
plasma reaction chamber. Feed stock in the form of 
hydrocarbons as liquid or gas is introduced via 
nozzles in one end of the reaction chamber and is 
mixed into a hydrogen plasma stream. Carbon black is 
separated from the off gas and parts of the hydrogen 
formed are recycled for use as the plasma gas. From DD-A-276 098 is known a method in which a part of 
a feed stream intended for a steam-hydrocarbon 
reforming process is decomposed to carbon black in a 
plasma reaction chamber. A commercial process for the 
production of hydrogen involves two steps. The first 
step is the steam reforming of a hydrocarbon to give a 
gas

<CLAIMS>
In a process for generating energy by the 
combustion of natural gas or hydrocarbon gas a method 

of reducing the discharge of carbon dioxide from the 
process which method includes the following steps: 


providing a feed stream of natural gas or 
hydrocarbon gas for use as fuel; 
feeding the gas stream to the combustion process 
where it is burnt to generate energy; and 
discharging the waste gases; 
 
characterized in that: 


the entire feed stream is subjected before 
entering the combustion process to a pyrolytic 

process by means of a plasma torch in a 
decomposition reactor, the process yielding 

carbon, hydrogen, and, optionally undecomposed 
gas; and 
removing the carbon from the hydrogen and the 
undecomposed gas, if present, so that the gas 

stream exiting the reactor and entering the 
energy-producing combustion process contains 

substantially only hydrogen and, optionally, 
undecomposed gas. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the feed stream fed to the combustion process has 

substantially no carbon content and is essentially a 
hydrogen fuel.
