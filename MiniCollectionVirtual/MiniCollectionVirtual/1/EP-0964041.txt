<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive melt composition (I) based on natural rubber or synthetic rubber, adhesive resin and promoters to improve the radiation cross-linking yield, contains solid, rubber soluble or dispersible monothiols (II) as stabilizers and optionally, at least a liquid phosphite ester that is compatible with the rubber.

<CLAIMS>
Use of solid, rubber-soluble or rubber-dispersible monothiols as stabilizers in
melted pressure-sensitive adhesive compositions based on natural rubber or

synthetic rubbers, suitable tackifying resins and promoters for increasing the
radiation crosslinking yield.
Use according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the monothiol is
2-mercaptobenzimidazole or a substituted derivative.
Use according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the substituted derivative is

4-(and/or 5)-methyl-2-mercaptobenzimidazole.
Use according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 polyfunctional
(meth)acrylates such as hexanediol diacrylate (HDDA), trimethylolpropane

triacrylate (TMPTA), pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETA) and their
ethoxylated, propoxylated or trimerized derivatives are employed as

crosslinking promoters.
Use according to Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that
 at least one liquid
phosphite ester compatible with the rubber is additionally present.
Melted pressure-sensitive adhesive composition based on natural rubber or
synthetic rubbers, suitable tackifying resins and promoters for increasing the

radiation crosslinking yield, comprising solid, rubber-soluble or rubber-dispersible
monothiols as stabilizers and, if desired, at least one liquid

phosphite ester compatible with the rubber.
