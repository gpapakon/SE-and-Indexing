<ABSTRACT>
A shaving system (110) includes a platform member (30) with a support surface (36) that has a plurality of apertures (50) therein and guard structure (34) integral therewith and disposed forwardly of the support surface, a cap member (44) with a plurality of post elements (76) for disposition in the apertures (50) in the support structure (36), a primary blade member (38) having a planar body and a cutting edge, a secondary blade member (40) having a planar body and a cutting edge (60), each blade member having a plurality of apertures (62 A-D) and at least two of the apertures having spaced locating surfaces (64s) for positioning engagement with the post elements (76), and a plurality of discrete spacer members (42) disposed on the post elements (76) and between the primary and secondary blade members (38, 40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shaving
systems and more particularly to safety razors
of the wet shave type.Known shaving systems include two or
more blade elements disposed parallel to each
other in spaced relation so that the cutting
edges are successively active with respect to
hair elements being cut during a shaving stroke.
Various types of debris such as whisker
particles are gradually deposited and tend to
clog region between successive cutting edges and
adversely affect the shaving characteristics of
the shaving system. A number of arrangements
have been proposed for removing such debris
including a variety of pusher arrangements.Also, in shaving systems, it is
frequently desirable to fix the shaving head
relative to the handle portion so that the
entire razor structure may be discarded at the
end of its useful life. The coupling mechanism
between the handle and the shaving head
desirably enables and is consistent with
economical manufacture of razor components by
molding techniques and provides a mechanically
sturdy interconnection between the handle and
the shaving head. Published PCT application WO-A-8 302 915, which is an earlier
application of the applicants, presents a shaving head having a depending
socket and an elongated straight projection integral with a handle which snaps
in the socket.According to the present invention, there is provided a shaving system
comprising a shaving head that includes at least one blade member with a
cutting edge disposed adjacent guard structure, and a handle including a grip
portion, said shaving head having a socket for receiving said handle and
having opposed spaced surfaces and said handle having a mating prong
dimensioned to enter said socket, characterized in that latch structure is
formed in one of said surfaces and locking edge structure is formed in the
other of said surfaces opposed to said latch structure, and in that the prong
includes a body portion and a tip portion with a latch projection protruding
from one side of said tip portion and a latch recess in the opposite side of said
tip portion for engagement with said latch structure and said locking edge
structure respectively such that mating surfaces of said socket portion and
said prong portion are fixed in firm engagement. Preferably, the prong portion includes
a seat surface which cooperates with a seat
surface on an interior surface of the socket
portion, and supplemental axially extending
guide surfaces are provided on the socket and
prong portions. In a particular embodiment, a 
cam

<CLAIMS>
A shaving system comprising a shaving head (14) that includes at least
one blade member (38, 40) with a cutting edge (60) disposed adjacent guard

structure (34), and a handle (12) including a grip portion (18), said shaving
head having a socket (32) for receiving said handle and having opposed

spaced surfaces (114, 116) and said handle having a mating prong (90)
dimensioned to enter said socket, characterized in that latch structure (120) is

formed in one of said surfaces and locking edge structure (124) is formed in
the other of said surfaces opposed to said latch structure, and in that the

prong (90) includes a body portion and a tip portion with a latch projection
(102) protruding from one side of said tip portion and a latch recess (106) in

the opposite side of said tip portion for engagement with said latch structure
(120) and said locking edge structure (124) respectively such that mating surfaces

of said socket portion and said prong portion are fixed in firm engagement.
A shaving system according to claim 1, characterized in that a seat
surface (96) is provided on said prong and a cooperating seat surface is

provided on an interior surface of said socket.
A shaving system according to claim 1, characterized in that the socket
and the prong each include axially extending guide surfaces along the sides

thereof.
A shaving system according to claim 3, characterized in that each said
guide surface includes a transversely extending seat surface.
A shaving system according to claim 1, characterized in that a cam
surface (118) is provided in the socket (32) adjacent the locking edge

structure.
A shaving system according to claim 1, characterized in that the socket
(32) further includes a skirt portion having an end surface disposed at an

inclined angle to the axis of said socket. 
A shaving system according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that a transition portion extends between the shaving head and the handle,

said transition portion having an axis disposed at an angle of approximately
150 degrees to the plane of said blade member and in that the guard structure

is disposed approximately one half centimeter forward to said axis of said
transition portion and approximately one centimeter forward to the axis of the

grip portion.
A shaving system according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the shaving head (14) includes two blade members (38, 40) for

successive shaving engagement, and in that the guard structure (34) is
disposed forwardly of the axis of the grip portion.
