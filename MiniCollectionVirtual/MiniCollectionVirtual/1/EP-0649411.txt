<DESCRIPTION>
 BORONATED COMPOUNDSRelated ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/453,311, filed December 20, 1989, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.Field of the InventionThis invention pertains to novel boron containing compounds having pharmaceutical activity. More specifically, compounds of the present invention include boronated bases, nucleosides and nucleotides having antihyperlipidemic, antiinflammatory, and analgesic activity.Background ofthe Invention Antimetabolites are a well known class of antineoplastic agents that function by interfering with nucleic acid synthesis and consequently, replication within the target cells. Some of these compounds structurally mimic biosynthetic precursors of the naturally occurring nucleic acids, which are essential for replication and cell survival. By replacing these precursors, but without exhibiting the same biological effect, these compounds disrupt replication resulting in the demise of the target cell. 

 Many antimetabolites have significant antiviral and antitumor activity and are incorporated in a variety of therapeutic regimens. But despite the therapeutic benefits of such compounds, their use is often accompanied by deleterious side effects, e.g. nausea, alopecia, and bone marrow depression. Accordingly, a great deal of interest has focused on synthesizing new analogues with improved therapeutic indexes. We have recently discovered that boron containing nucleotides may be one class of improved nucleic acid analogues. Some exemplary boronated nucleotides are described in copending, commonly owned U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/443,781 of B. Spielvogel, A. Sood, I. Hall, and B. Ramsay-Shaw titled "Oligoribonucleoside and Oligodeoxyribonucleoside Boranophosphates" and filed November 30, 1989, which is incorporated herein by reference. There we describe, for example, boronated oligonucleotides that contain a boron functionality attached to internucleotide phosphorus.Boron containing compounds are also useful in an antineoplastic regimen known as Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) . Soloway, A.H., Progress in Boron Chemistry; Steinberg, H. , McCloskey, A.τ. Eds.; the Macmillan Company: New York, 1964; Vol. 1, Chapter 4, 203-234. BNCT requires two components (Boron-10 and low energy thermal neutrons) for a radiotoxic reaction. The inherent advantage is that each component can be manipulated independently to produce the desired radiation effect.
