<ABSTRACT>
For delaminating laminated foil blanks which are provided with incisions in a covering foil (1) adhesively bonded to a carrier paper (2) by means of a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer located on the rear side, a parting line (20) is incised into the carrier paper of a leading edge region (12) of each foil blank, before the edge region is drawn off from the carrier paper by a transfer device (7) in cooperation with a deflecting edge (6).

Method of stripping laminated sheet blanks provided with indentations 
in a liner sheet adhesively fixed at a base paper by means of 

a self-adhesive layer on its rear side, which indentations constitute 
a lettered or graphic advertising representation designed for self-adhesive 

attachment on an advertising area, which lettered or graphic 
advertising representation remains on said base paper when a residual 

sheet portion of said liner sheet is stripped off said base paper 
of said sheet blanks, including 


conveyor means carrying said sheet blanks (3) in a predetermined 
conveying direction (4); 
cutting means (9) disposed along said conveying direction (4), 
by means of which a parting line (20) is indented in said base 

paper (2) at a leading edge zone (12) of each sheet blank, at a 
predetermined spacing from the leading edge thereof and 

across said conveying direction, from the bottom side of said 
base paper, at a depth of cut extending at most up to the point 

where the bottom side of said liner sheet (1) is scratched; 
transfer means (5) used to retain said leading edge zone (12) 
indented at said base paper (2) of each sheet blank by means 

of retainer means and to forward same to a defector edge (6) 
interacting with said liner sheet (1) in a transfer direction (7) 

branching off said conveying direction (4), with said residual 
sheet portion (16) being stripped off said base paper at said deflector 

edge (6) for being transferred to a reject take-up reel 
downstream in said transfer direction (7), whilst said base paper  

 
(2) at said lettered or graphic advertising representation, 

which remains on the top side thereof, is removed in said predetermined 
conveying direction (4). 
Method according to Claim 1, wherein the indentation of said base 
paper (2) of said leading edge zone (12) of each sheet blank (3) is 

performed in the immediate vicinity of said deflector edge (6). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, wherein each sheet blank (3) is 
retained by a retaining force acting between its top and bottom 

sides, throughout the period of indentation of said parting line (20) 
in said base paper (2) of
 said leading edge zone (12). 
Device for stripping laminated sheet blanks provided with indentations 
in a liner sheet adhesively fixed to a base paper by means of 

a self-adhesive layer on its rear side, which indentations constitute 
a lettered or graphic advertising representation designed for self-adhesive 

attachment on an advertising area, which lettered or graphic 
representation remains on said base paper when a residual sheet 

portion of said liner sheet is stripped off said base paper of said 
sheet blanks, by interaction of said transfer means (5) with a deflector 

edge (6) in a transfer direction branching off said conveying 
direction (4) of said sheet blanks (3) 
characterized by:
cutting means (9) configured such that a parting line (20) is indented 
in said base paper (2) at a leading edge zone (12) of 

each sheet blank, at a predetermined spacing from the leading 
edge thereof and across the conveying direction, from the bottom 

side of said base paper, at a depth of cut which extends at 
most up to a point where the bottom side of said liner sheet (1) 

is scratched;  
 
retainer means (17, 18) mounted at said transfer means (5) and 
configured such that said leading edge zone (12), which is provided 

with said indented parting line (20), is initially retained up 
to the transfer of the residual sheet portion to a reject take-up 

reel, so as to strip off said residual sheet portion (16) from said 
base paper. 
Device according to Claim 4, wherein said cutting means (9) are 
mounted in the immediate vicinity of said deflector edge (6). 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, wherein said deflector edge (6) is 
formed at the apex of a stripping ridge (14) including two guide 

surfaces for guiding said liner sheet (1) and said residual sheet portion 
(16), with these guide surfaces extending in parallel with said 

conveying (4) and transfer (7) directions and meeting at the apex, 
whilst a comparatively mobile retaining element (15) cooperates 

with the guide surface parallel to the conveying direction (4) and 
serves to retain each sheet blank (3) against this guide surface of 

said stripping ridge (14) throughout the period of indentation of 
said parting line (20). 
Device according to any of Claims 4 to 6, wherein said cutting 
means (9) are designed with a blade support (10) suitable to reciprocate 

across said conveying direction (4), which carries a blade (8) 
which is employed for progressively indenting said parting line (20) 

in said base paper (2) of said leading edge zone (12). 
Device according to any of Claims 4 to 7, wherein said retainer 
means of said transfer means (5) are designed with two retaining 

elements (17, 18) which are mobile relative to each other and 
which are disposed so as to retain said leading edge zone (12) of 

each sheet blank (3) such that it will bear against said top side of 
said liner sheet (1) and the bottom side of said base paper (2).
