<ABSTRACT>
Hydraulically damped rubber bushing (1) comprising two independently produced annular parts (2, 3) which are joined together in the axial direction, the annular parts (2, 3) each having an inner supporting sleeve (4) and an outer supporting sleeve (5) surrounding the inner sleeve (4) with a radial clearance, and a spring body (6) of elastomeric material which connects the supporting sleeves (4, 5) and is provided with at least two openings (7, 8), the annular parts (2, 3) being designed and assembled in such a way that the openings (7, 8) complement one another to form a first (9) and a second fluid-filled working chamber (10), these being sealed off from the environment and connected to one another via at least one damping device (11) for the transfer of fluid. The two spring bodies (6) of the annular parts (2, 3) can be clamped together in such a way that the axial and radial spring stiffeners can be set independently of one another.

A hydraulically damped rubber bushing (1) comprising 
two annular parts (2, 3) which are produced 

independently of one another and are joined together in 
the axial direction, the annular parts each having an 

inner supporting sleeve (4; 4.1, 4.2) and an outer 
supporting sleeve (5; 5.1, 5.2) surrounding the inner 

supporting sleeve with a radial spacing, and further 
comprising a spring body (6) of elastomeric material 

which connects the supporting sleeves (4, 5) and is 
provided with at least two cavities (7, 8), the annular 

parts being designed and joined together in such a way 
that the cavities complement one another to form a first 

and a second fluid-filled working chamber (9, 10), which 
are sealed off from the surroundings and are connected to 

one another by at least one damping device (11) in a 
manner which allows the transmission of fluid, and the 

loads being transmitted primarily in the axial direction, 
via bearing portions of the inner supporting sleeves 

(4.1, 4.2), said bearing portions extending radially in 
some areas, with the interposition of first, axial outer 

partial areas of the spring body (6), to bearing portions 
of the outer supporting sleeves (5.1, 5.2), the latter 

bearing portions likewise extending radially in some 
areas, characterized in that a second, inner partial area 

of the spring bodies (6), which axially adjoins the 
bearing portions of the outer supporting sleeves (5.1, 

5.2), rests radially against the outside of the respectively 
outer supporting sleeve (5.1, 5.2), and in that the 

axially adjacent end faces of the second partial areas of 
the spring bodies (6) rest against one another in such a  

 
way under axial prestress, due to installation, that an 

elastic deformation and compression in this area for the 
purpose of increasing the spring rate both in the axial 

and in the radial direction occur. 
A rubber bushing according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the spring bodies (6) delimit at least one 

of the working chambers (9, 10) on the side facing away 
from the inner supporting sleeves (4) by means of a roof-shaped 

profile (12), in that, in order to establish a 
radial prestress, the spring bodies (6) as manufactured 

have a greater axial extent than in the prestressed, 
installed state and in that, to establish an axial 

prestress, the axially adjacent inner and outer supporting 
sleeves (4, 5) surround one another at least partially 

in the installed state. 
A rubber bushing according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the inner and outer supporting sleeves (4, 

5) are composed of a metallic material and in that at 
least one (4.1) of the inner supporting sleeves and at 

least one (5.1) of the outer supporting sleeves surrounds 
one end of the axially adjacent supporting sleeves (4.2, 

5.2) with positive engagement. 
A rubber bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that, as manufactured, the spring 

bodies (6) delimit an essentially O-shaped gap (13) on 
the sides which face one another. 
A rubber bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the cavities (7, 8) in the 

spring bodies (6) form at least one restrictor passage 
(14) on the sides facing one another. 
A rubber bushing according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the restrictor passage (14) is arranged in 

the region of the inner circumference of the outer 
supporting sleeves (5). 
A rubber bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the inner supporting sleeves 

(4.1, 4.2) are supported, on the inside and in the region 
of their mutually remote ends, on at least one sliding 

sleeve (15) made of polymeric material, and in that the  
 

sliding sleeve (15) is guided in the axial and radial 
direction in a bearing bracket (16). 
A rubber bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the inner supporting sleeves 

(4.1, 4.2) have an essentially trough-shaped profile in 
the installed state and are at least partially surrounded 

at the ends by a first rubber overflow (17) formed 
integrally with the adjoining spring element (6), in that 

the outer supporting sleeve (5.1) of one of the two 
annular parts (2) at least partially overlap the axially 

adjacent annular element (3) axially and in that the 
outer supporting sleeve (5.1) is provided at least 

partially on the outer circumference with a second rubber 
overflow (18). 
A rubber bushing according to claim 8, characterized 
in that the rubber overflows (17, 18) are each 

provided with a profiling (19, 20), these being designed 
as means of compensating length and diameter tolerances. 
A rubber bushing according to any of claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that a valve (21) made of elastomeric 

material is arranged axially between the annular parts 
(2, 3), said valve being provided with a closing member 

(22) which projects in the direction of the inner supporting 
sleeves (4), and in that the closing member (22) 

divides each working chamber (9, 10) into two axially 
adjacent subchambers (9.1, 9.2; 10.1, 10.2) and can be 

actuated by differential pressure within the subchambers 
(9.1, 9.2; 10.1, 10.2).
