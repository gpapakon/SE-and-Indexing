<ABSTRACT>
A solid state process for modifying polyvinyl alcohol using a 
Michael-type addition wherein dry polyvinyl alcohol powder is sprayed 

with a solution of a monomer capable of Michael-type addition in an 
amount sufficient to swell the polyvinyl alcohol or maintain its swollen 

state, but not dissolve or form a slurry of the polyvinyl alcohol. The 
swollen polyvinyl alcohol is sprayed with a catalyst and the temperature 

is raised to initiate the reaction between the polyvinyl alcohol and the 
monomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to preparation of polyvinyl alcohol 
derivatives using a Michael-type addition. Polyvinyl alcohol is the largest volume, synthetic, water-soluble 
and biodegradable resin produced in the world. Its success is due in 
part to its excellent chemical resistance and physical properties as 
well as to its very low toxicity. The main applications for polyvinyl 
alcohol are in textile sizing, adhesives, polymerization stabilizers and 
paper coatings. As demand increases for better performance in these and 
other areas, more attention is given to production of polyvinyl alcohol 
derivatives which can meet the demand. Modification of polyvinyl alcohol 
by introducing functional groups (for example, sulfonates, phosphates 
and carboxylates) through copolymerization or post-modification is one 
means of enhancing the physical properties of polyvinyl alcohol. Copolymerization of vinyl acetate with functional vinyl monomers 
followed by saponification is a well-known route to modification of 
polyvinyl alcohol. Some applications of this technology are exemplified 
in the following patents: JP 56-73199 teaches copolymerization of vinyl acetate with 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic 
acid or its metal salts, to produce a 
polymer with improved flow properties for application in paper coatings. U.S. 4,529,522 teaches production of copolymers of polyvinyl 
alcohol and ethylene oxide or propylene oxide sulfonate ethers for use 
as viscosifiers in saline solutions. JP 60-56196 teaches copolymerization of vinyl acetate with 0.1 to 
0.3 mole percent sodium vinyl sulfonate or sodium allyl sulfonate and 
hydrolysis of 30 to 60 percent of the resulting copolymer. The product 
can be used in hot melt adhesives. JP 63-270704 teaches the manufacture of high polymerization degree 
sulfonic acid-containing modified polyvinyl alcohol by copolymerizing N-sulfoalkyl 
(meth)acrylamide and vinyl ester and then saponifying the 
resulting copolymer. The products are useful as emulsifiers.  
 The secondary hydroxyl groups in polyvinyl alcohol can be used as 
an active site for modification. Examples of these reactions can be 
found in Polyvinyl Alcohol, edited by Finch (Wiley, 1973), pages 183-202. 
Most of the reactions are carried out in aqueous or organic 
solution and do not result in a solid product. The energy costs 
associated with preparing the initial solution and in reducing the 
product to a solid makes most of these modification processes 
prohibitively expensive. Following are examples of
