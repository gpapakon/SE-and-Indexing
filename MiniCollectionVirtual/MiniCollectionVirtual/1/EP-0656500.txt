<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring the reactive torque 
acting on and the rotational speed of a drive shaft of 

the electric motor used to drive a valve actuator of a 
motor operated valve (MOV) comprises a motor power 

measuring cell (2) inserted between and bolted to the 
electric motor housing (3) and to the valve actuator 

housing (4) of the MOV to provide continuous in-service 
valve and motor diagnostics. The motor power measuring 

cell is provided with a first measuring means for 
measuring the torque acting on the drive shaft and a 

second measuring means for measuring the rotational 
speed of the drive shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for measuring 
the torque acting upon the drive shaft and the 
rotational speed of the drive shaft of an electric motor 
used to actuate a motor operated valve. This invention 
is especially useful in the field of valve diagnostics. In the nuclear power industry, valves are actuated 
remotely by electric motors to open, closed or 
intermediate positions to improve or maintain power 
plant output and to maintain proper cooling of the 
nuclear reactor. Continuous and proper operation of the 
valves is essential for reliable operation of the power 
plant and the safety of the general public. Both the 
power industry and the valve industry have had a need to 
develop apparatus and systems to continuously measure, 
test and monitor various operating parameters associated 
with valves, especially remote motor operated valves, 
and to alert the power plant operator of any significant 
changes in any of the operating parameters being 
measured, tested and monitored. In particular there is a need to develop apparatus 
and systems to continuously and directly measure and 
monitor the actual mechanical power being produced by an 
electric motor by continuously and directly measuring 
both the rotational speed and the total reactive torque 
acting on the drive shaft of the electric motor used to 
operate a motor operated valve (MOV), while the valve is 
in service. This has not heretofore been possible with 
commercial MOVs since the electric motor is sealed in a 
housing that is fastened directly to the sealed housing 
of the valve actuator. The commercial MOVs do not  
 
normally have an exposed drive shaft or other means to 
attach the sensors needed to mechanically measure the 
rotational speed or total reactive torque acting on the 
drive shaft. It is therefore an object of this invention to 
provide apparatus and a system to continuously and 
directly measure the rotational speed and the torque 
acting on the drive shaft of an electric motor being 
used to operate a motor operated valve. This object is achieved by the invention claimed in 
claim 1. An embodiment of the invention will now be 
described, by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, wherein: 
FIGURE 1 is a side elevation view of a motor 
operated valve (MOV), fitted with a motor power 
measuring cell according to an embodiment of this 
invention. FIGURE 2 is an isometric view of the motor operated 
valve of figure 1. FIGURE 3 is a side view, partly in section, 
illustrating a typical prior
