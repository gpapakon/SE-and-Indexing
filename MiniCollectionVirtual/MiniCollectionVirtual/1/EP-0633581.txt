<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to permanent magnet materials composed
mainly of R (where R represents at least one rare earth element), Fe and B, and a process
of producing the same, particularly, it relates to R-Fe-B permanent magnet materials and
to processes of producing the same. Such materials are typically powdered and then
molded into shape and sintered to form magnets.Nowadays, an R-Fe-B permanent magnet (Japanese Patent Application Laid
Open No. Sho 59-46008), is typically used as a high performance permanent magnet. A
high magnetic characteristic is obtained by a magnet material structure having a main
phase of ternary tetragonal compounds and an R-rich phase, and such magnets are used
in a broad field from general domestic electric appliance to peripheral equipment of
large-sized computers. Thus R-Fe-B permanent magnets having various structures have
been proposed so as to exhibit various magnetic characteristics depending on their
proposed uses.However, in response to recent stringent requirements in the manufacture of
small-sized, light and highly functional electric and electronic equipment, inexpensive R-Fe-B
permanent magnets with a higher performance are required.In general, the residual magnetic flux density (Br) of an Fe-B sintered magnet
can be expressed as the following Equation (1).
Br ∞ (Is•β)•f•{ρ/ρ0•(1-α)}2/3
where,
Is : saturation magnetizationβ : temperature dependence of Isf: Degree of orientationρ : density of sintered bodyρ0 : theoretical maximum densityα : volume fraction of grain boundary phase
(volume fraction of non-magnetic phase)Thus, in order to raise the residual magnetic flux density (Br) of an R-Fe-B 
sintered magnet, (1) the volume fraction of the R2Fe14B matrix phase may be increased,
(2) the density of the magnet may be raised to the theoretical maximum density, and
further, 3) the degree of orientation of the main phase crystal grains in a easily
magnetizing axial direction may be enhanced.Thus it is important to bring a magnet composition close to the
stoichiometrical composition of the above-mentioned R2Fe14B to achieve the item 1).
When the R-Fe-B sintered magnet is produced using as a starting material, an alloy ingot
which is prepared by melting the alloy having the aforementioned composition and
casting in a mold, since α-Fe crystallizes in the alloy ingot and the R-rich phase becomes
segregated locally, it is difficult to pulverize the ingot to fine powders and the
composition changes during pulverizing due to oxidation.In the case of mechanically
