<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for converting oscillatory rotation of an 
input shaft (24) to uni-directional rotation of an output 

shaft (26) has the input shaft (24) journalled to a frame 
(32) and rotatable about an input axis, over a range of 

rotational positions, between a forward limit and a reverse 
limit. An output shaft (26) is journalled to the frame 

(32) and rotatable about an output axis, which is normal to 
the input axis. Three bevel gears (60, 62, 64) are 

employed, namely a first gear (60) coupled to the input 
shaft (24), a second gear (62) coupled to the input shaft 

(24) and spaced axially from the first gear (60), and a 
third gear (64) coupled to the output shaft (26). The 

bevel teeth (70, 72, 74) of the three gears (60, 62, 64) 
are arranged in peripheral arrays covering cover less than 

one half of the entire periphery of each gear (60, 62, 64), 
so that the bevel teeth (74) of the third gear (64) inter-mesh 

only with the bevel teeth (70) of the first gear (60) 
whenever the input shaft rotates from the forward limit 

toward the reverse limit, and so that the bevel teeth (74) 
of the third gear (64) inter-mesh only with the bevel teeth 

(72) of the second gear (62) whenever the input shaft (24) 
rotates from the reverse limit toward the forward limit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a mechanism for converting 
oscillatory rotation of an input shaft to uni-directional 
rotation of an output shaft. The mechanism can be 
advantageously employed in a strapping tool of a type 
having an actuating handle arranged to be manually 
oscillated. In a strapping tool of a type used to apply a steel 
strap in a tensioned loop around a package and to join the 
strap via a series of inter-locking joints comprising 
inter-lockable shoulders punched into overlapped ends of 
the strap, an actuating handle is provided, which is 
arranged to be manually oscillated. The handle rotates an 
output shaft, which actuates a series of cams, via an 
input shaft, to which the handle is coupled, and intermediate 
gears. The cams drive a series of punches, which 
punch inter-lockable shoulders into overlapped ends of the 
strap. Tremper et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,825,512 provides a 
recent example of such a strap having such a series of 
inter-locking joints. Moreover, in a strapping tool of the type noted 
above, a mechanism is provided for converting oscillatory 
motion of the actuating handle to uni-directional rotation 
of the output shaft. Typically, heretofore, the converting 
mechanism has employed a uni-directional clutch to couple 
the handle to the input shaft upon forward motion of the 
handle and to de-couple the handle from the input shaft 
upon reverse motion of the handle. Thus, reverse motion 
of the handle has been unproductive, except to re-set the 
handle for forward motion. Typically, moreover, two 
strokes of forward motion of the handle have been required 
to provide one complete rotation of the output shaft for 
one complete stroke of the punches. A mechanism employing bevel gears and ratchet wheels 
for converting oscillatory rotation of an input shaft to  
 
uni-directional rotation of an output shaft is known. Such 
a mechanism is exemplified in Grafstein et al., Pictorial 
Handbook of Technical Devices, Chemical Publishing Co., 
Inc. (1971) at pages 60 and 61. However, if it were 
employed in a strapping tool of the type noted above, such 
a mechanism would not be entirely satisfactory. Such a 
mechanism does not limit oscillatory rotation of the input 
shaft to any specific range and does not limit uni-directional 
rotation of the output shaft to any specific 
range. In a strapping tool of the type noted above, 
however, it is desirable to limit oscillatory rotation of 
the input shaft to a specific range (e.g. approximately 
180Â°) and to limit uni-directional

input shaft (24) to uni-directional rotation of an output 

shaft (26), the mechanism comprising

about the input axis, over a range of rotational positions 
of the input shaft relative to the frame (30), between a 

forward limit of the range and a reverse limit of the 
range,

being rotatable about the output axis, the output axis 
being normal to the input axis, 
(d) three bevel gears, namely a first gear (60) 
coupled to the input shaft (24) so as to enable conjoint 

rotation of the first gear (60) and the input shaft (24), 
a second gear (62) coupled to the input shaft (24) so as to 

enable conjoint rotation of the second gear (62) and the 
input shaft (24), and a third gear (64) coupled to the 

output shaft (26) so as to enable conjoint rotation of the 
third gear (64) and the output shaft (26), the first and 

second gears (60, 62) being spaced axially from each other 
along the input shaft (24), the first gear (60) having a 

peripheral array of bevel teeth (70), the second gear (62) 
having a peripheral array of bevel teeth (72), said teeth 

(70, 72) being arranged so that the bevel teeth (74) of the 
third gear (64) inter-mesh only with the bevel teeth (70, 

72) of one of the first (60) and second (62) gears at any 
one time when the input shaft (24) rotates between its 

forward and reverse limits, and in which each of the first, 
second and third gears (60,62,64) include bevel teeth 

(70,72,74) around less than their entire periphery. 
The mechanism of claim 1, wherein the bevel teeth 
(70, 72, 74) of the first, second, and third gears (60, 62,  

 
64) are arranged so that the bevel teeth (74) of the third

engage an endmost one of the bevel teeth (74) of the third 
gear (64), at one end of the peripheral array of bevel 

teeth (74) of the third gear (64), and the peripheral gap
