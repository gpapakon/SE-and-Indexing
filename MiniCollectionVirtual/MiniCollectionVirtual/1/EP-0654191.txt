<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the transmission and
receipt of data over telecommunications channels via the use
of modems. More particularly, this invention relates to
apparatus and methods for modem equilization which predistort
data signals in a transmitter prior to sending the signals
over a channel.Data signals which are sent over a channel from a
transmitter to a receiver are often corrupted by the inherent
characteristics of the channel. Those inherent
characteristics include the inability of a channel to provide
a perfect response to a signal; i.e. the state of the channel
at a previous moment in time affects the response of the
channel at a later moment in time. In the art, this is known
as intersymbol interference or ISI. In addition to ISI, data
signals are also subjected to noise. Both the noise and ISI
reduce the ability of a receiver to determine exactly what was
transmitted from the transmitter.In attempting to correct for ISI, it is common in the art
to supply an equalizer in the receiver. The function of the
equalizer is to correct for the ISI of the received signals so
that the initial data can be recovered. With an equalizer in
the receiver, typically, a known sequence of data signals
(i.e. a training sequence) is sent from the transmitter to the
receiver. Being that the data signal sequence itself is
known, and the signals being received are known, it is
possible for the equalizer first to determine the effects of
the channel (i.e. the channel coefficients) on the transmitted
signals, and then to compensate for those effects via any of
several processes such as linear equalization or decision 
feedback equalization. Linear equalization functions by
multiplying the incoming signals by the inverse of the ISI.
While the ISI is generally removed from the incoming signals
in this manner, noise inherent in the data transmission is
undesirably simultaneously amplified. Additional details of
linear equalization may be obtained by reference to Lee,
Edward A. and Messerschmitt, David G., Digital Communication;
(Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1988).Decision feedback equalization avoids the noise
amplification problems of linear equalization. However, in
recreating the ISI via feedback, decision feedback
equalization runs the risk of error propagation, as any
decision errors that are made are fed back. Additional
details of decision feedback equalization may be obtained by
reference to Lee, Edward A. and Messerschmitt, David G.,
Digital Communication; (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1988).In
