equipment useful for winning of ores particularly coal in 

longwal mining, said equipment comprises hydraulic master 
chock shield having atleast two legs at the outer edges, the 

master chock shield having a cylindrical conveyor belt intake 
end roller rotatably mounted on a stand fixed to the base 

plate of the master chock shield, the base plate of the said 
chock shield also being provided with a plurality of stands 

having free moving conveyor belt guide rollers a plurality of 
known hydraulic chocks having atleast four legs at its edges, 

being placed in front of master chock shield in a horizontal 
line, the said master chock shield and the chocks being 

interlinked by means of atleast one hydraulic ram the base 
plates of each of the chocks being provided with plurality of 

stands having free conveyor belt guide rollers, the end chock 
also being provided with two horizontally fixed multi-telescopic 

booms supported on free moving wheels the extreme 
end of the said booms being fixed to a fixed belt conveyor 

structure the fixed belt conveyor structure having free 
moving conveyor belt guide rollers a drive head conveyor belt 

roller being provided at the extreme end of the fixed 
structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved 
equipment useful for winning of ores, particularly coal 
in longwall mining. Longwall mining is the most efficient and 
globally practised underground method of winning coal, 
which offers possibility of complete automation. 
Gradually, over the years there has been consistent 
effort to reduce the manpower deployed at a longwall 
face. In fact, any device can be made fully automatic 
only when the whole operation involved is machine 
dependent using practically no manpower. With the 
present longwall mechanisation system available, only 
the face machine system can be made automatic as the 
face operations are fully mechanised, but at the same 
time it involves many other functions in gateroads, 
most of which are manually operated, and therefore, 
become hindrance to the further automation of the 
system. Here the existing equipment for longwall 
mining is illustrated with reference to figure-1 of the 
drawings accompanying this specification. There are 
two sets of master chock shield (1) and slave chock 
shield (2) at the two rear ends of longwall face 
equipment with general chock shields within them along  
 
the face. In front of the chock shields there is an 
armoured face conveyor (3) along the face which has got 
two sigma sections on both side of it over which a 
shearer (4) is movably installed. Shearer cuts coal 
and loads automatically to the armoured face conveyor 
(hereinafter called AFC). 
At the discharge end of AFC (5) there 
is another armoured conveyor at the right angle along 
gate road, which is called Bridge Stage Loader 
(hereinafter called BSL) (6). One of BSL (6) is 
elevated like bridge. At the discharge end of BSL 
there is a belt conveyor along gate road in the same 
line which is called gate belt conveyor (GBC) (7) which 
discharges to trunk belt conveyor (not shown). There 
are unit vertical supports (not shown) upto 30 meters 
ahead of working face. There is a rail line (9) along 
the gate road beside the gate belt conveyor. Longwall method involves the following 
operations as practised commonly - (a) cutting of coal 
by shearer or by plough (b) conveying coal from face by 
AFC, (c) crushing of coal to size, (d) conveying coal 
from armourned face conveyor to trunk belt conveyor by 
bridge stage loader and from there to out-bye system 
(e) supporting the face, (f) supporting gateroads, (g) 
shifting of bridge stage loader and power pack (h) 
dismantling of rails, (i) tensioning arrangement and 
shifting of belt intake (low height)
