<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns antiidiotypic antibodies comprising human constant regions, and murine variable regions bearing the internal image of human high molecular weight-melanoma associated antigen, and derivatives thereof which have the specificity of said antibody. These antiidiotypic monoclonal antibodies and derivatives have immune-regulatory functions and can therefore be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, such as the treatment of melanoma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns antiidiotypic monoclonal antibodies comprising human constant
regions, and variable regions bearing the internal image of human high molecular
weight-melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA), and derivatives of said antibodies.
The antibodies of the invention and their derivatives are useful for diagnostic, prophylactic
and therapeutic purposes, such as the immune therapy of melanoma.Melanomas are tumors of the skin, less frequently of mucous membranes, some of which
are benign. Malignant melanomas are carcinomas of neuroectodermal origin generally
derived from melanocytes (pigment-producing cells), sometimes from mucous
membranes, the chorioid coat or the meninges. There are several types of malignant
melanoma which differ in localization, way of spreading and production of metastases.Conventional treatment of melanoma includes surgery, radio- or chemotherapy, and the
application of biological response modifiers. However, these methods have proved to be
insufficient to combat the illness, e.g. to prevent tumor recurrence, and are complicated by
a large number of severe side effects. Therefore, it is desirable to develop therapeutic
approaches which overcome these drawbacks and can replace or be used in combination
with conventional treatment.Since the immune system seems to be heavily involved in the pathogenesis of this disease,
the most suitable treatment would be a method of active immunotherapy, for example
based on the application of specific antiidiotypic antibodies. Of special interest for
therapeutic application are antiidiotypic antibodies of the internal image type which mimic
the initial antigen and can substitute for it.For tumor therapy, suitable antiidiotypic antibodies are those which are raised against
antibodies specific for tumor associated antigens. In melanoma, one of the associated 
antigens (MAA) identified so far is the high molecular weight-melanoma associated
antigen (HMW-MAA) with a molecular weight of > 1,000,000. Murine antiidiotypic
monoclonal antibodies raised against an antibody to HMW-MAA have been disclosed in
European Patent Application No. 428 485.However, a major limitation in the use of said murine-derived antiidiotypic monoclonal
antibodies as diagnostic and therapeutic agents is their immunogenicity as foreign
proteins, their rather long persistence in the circulation, and the formation of damaging
immune complexes. On the other hand, the treatment with human monoclonal antibodies
is also limited since human hybridoma cell lines are hard to
