<ABSTRACT>
Cellular biological material (such as living tissue) is analysed or monitored by applaying an AC electrical potential across the biological material so as to produce a non linear dielectric spectrum, and obtaining a detectable signal corresponding to the resulting spectrum. The potential is of a first frequency and the measured response at one or more second frequency substantially not overlapping with the first frequency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and method for
analysis or monitoring of biological material and particularly,
but not exclusively, to apparatus for monitoring or analysis of
cellular biological material, in which a response is obtained
from enzymes retained within cell membranes.The linear passive audio and radio frequency electrical
properties of biological cell materials are well known. In the
frequency range below about 10 MHz, these properties are
conveniently measured as the equivalent parallel conductance and
capacitance of an electrochemical cell containing the system
under study. Up to these radio-frequencies, most biological cell
materials exhibit two major dispersions, known as the alpha and
beta dispersions. Whilst other sub-dispersions contribute to
these major dispersions, and may occasionally be separated from
them, the beta dispersion of tissues and cell suspensions is
caused predominantly by the build-up of charge at the essentially
non-conducting plasma membrane surfaces. The alpha dispersion,
though not always dependent upon the ionic strength of the
medium, is usually accounted for mainly in terms of the
relaxation of counter-ions tangential to the charged surfaces of
the membrane and cell envelope.In the simplest case of dielectric relaxation, that of
the reorientation of a "hard" sphere with a permanent dipole
moment, the statistical mean of the cosine of the angle which the
dipole makes with the field, has a field-dependence following the
Langevin function:-
cos <> = coth x - 1/x, 
where x = E/kT. A Taylor expansion of this series shows that
substantial deviations from linearity do not occur for values of
x less than approximately 1, and that to an excellent
approximation cos <> = µE/3kT. Thus the dielectric displacement
current is proportional to the magnitude of the exciting field,
and their ratio, the admittance, independent of it. These
properties are characteristic of a linear system obeying the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem.Due to the fact that they are suspended or dissolved
in conductive aqueous media, biological dielectrics are "lossy".
Thus electrochemical reactions, and especially Joule heating,
restrict the AC voltages that may be applied to them, and the
dielectric properties of biological cell materials are typically
measured using macroscopic electrical fields E of the order 0.1
to 5 V.cm-1. Given the effective dipole moments usually
encountered, the Langevin factor µE/kT is normally minuscule,
and, as judged by the independence of the measured admittance
