Method for the radio-frequency connection of 
active subsections of a radio-frequency transmission 

system, each subsection being installed in a vehicle, and 
a first subsection containing two radio-frequency cables 

and one head station, and at least one further subsection 
containing two radio-frequency cables and a radio-frequency 

amplifier which is looped into one of the radio-frequency 
cables, and the radio-frequency cables having 

plug connector elements at the ends of the vehicles, via 
which plug connector elements first radio-frequency 

signals which are transmitted by the head station in the 
coupled state of the plug connector elements are 

transmitted to the subsections, 
characterised in that
 a 
vehicle station (16) which is contained in each vehicle 

(12, 13) with the exception of the vehicle (11) having 
the head station (15) interrogates the radio-frequency 

plug connectors (30, 31) of the vehicle (12) for the 
presence of the first radio-frequency signal (HF1) which 

is passed from the direction of the head station (15) 
until it has identified the first radio-frequency signal, 

and in that it interrogates the radio-frequency plug 
connectors (30, 31) for a second radio-frequency signal 

(HF2), coming from the opposing direction, until it has 
identified, by means of the second radio-frequency 

signal, the connected coupling state of a plug connector 
(30), and in that the vehicle station (16) connects the 

input of the amplifier (41) to that plug connector (30) 
which carries the first radio-frequency signal (HF1), and 

connects the output of this amplifier to that plug  
 

connector (31) which has been identified as being connected, 
by means of the second radio-frequency signal 

(HF2). 
Device for carrying out the method according to 
Claim 1, comprising a vehicle unit (10) having a 

plurality of vehicles (11, 12, 13, 14) and comprising a 
plurality of subsections of a radio-frequency transmission 

system, each subsection being installed in a 
vehicle, and a first subsection containing two radio-frequency 

cables and one head station (15), and at least 
one further subsection containing two radio-frequency 

cables and a radio-frequency amplifier which is looped 
into one of the radio-frequency cables, and the radio-frequency 

cables having plug connector elements at the 
ends of the vehicles, via which plug connector elements 

first radio-frequency signals which are transmitted by 
the head station (15) in the coupled state of the plug 

connector elements are transmitted to the subsections, 
characterised in that each vehicle station (16) has a 

time-sequence controller (43) for controlling a switching 
device (40), which produces the connections between the 

plug connector elements (24, 25) and the amplifier (41) 
of the vehicle (12), a first detector (42) for 

identifying the first radio- frequency signal (HF1), and 
a second detector (44) for identifying the second radio-frequency 

signal (HF2), as well as a radio-frequency 
generator (47) for producing a radio-frequency measurement 

signal (HFM), the second radio-frequency signal 
(HF2) being the radio-frequency measurement signal which 

is reflected on an open plug connector (30). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the radio-frequency amplifier (41) is a pilot-regulated 

amplifier (410) which is regulated by means of 
a pilot signal (U
p
) transmitted by the head station (15), 
and in that a pilot signal evaluating device (411), which 

belongs to the radio-frequency amplifier (410), at the 
same time takes over the function of the first detector 

(42). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterised in  
 

that the second radio-frequency signal (HF2) is the pilot 
signal (U
p
) which is reflected on an open plug connector 
(30). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised 
in that the second radio-frequency signal (HF2) 

is produced by a radio-frequency generator (51) which is 
accommodated in a vehicle station (16) which is located 

in the opposing direction with respect to the head 
station (15). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the frequency of the second radio-frequency signal 

(HF2) is located outside the transmission frequency band 
of the amplifier (41). 
Device according to one of Claims 2 to 6, characterised 
in that an amplifier unit which transmits signals 

in two directions is provided instead of an amplifier 
(41) which transmits signals in only one direction.
