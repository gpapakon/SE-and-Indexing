<ABSTRACT>
A substantially liquid, aqueous, rare earth oxide based composition for preserving the lustre of the smooth surfaces of objects needing to have such an appearance. The composition is characterized in that the rare earth oxide in the composition consists of particles with an average diameter of less than two micrometres (2 (my)m), and in that the aqueous solvent includes a polysiloxane oil and a degreasing agent for diluting the polysiloxane oil.

<CLAIMS>
A substantially liquid aqueous composition, with a base of a rare earth oxide, for 
preserving the lustre of smooth surfaces of objects, such as glazing metallic oxide layers, 

which have to have a lustre of this kind, 

the average diameter of the rare earth oxide particles being smaller than two micrometers 
(2 µm), 
the composition being 
characterised in that,
 as a percentage of its total water-containing 
weight: 


ten to seventy percent (10 to 70 %) thereof is the rare earth oxide, 
zero point one to fifty percent (0.1 to 50 %) thereof is a polysiloxanic oil, 
five to sixty percent (5 to 60 %) thereof is a degreasing and thinning agent of the 
polysiloxanic oil, which agent comprises a base of esters, hydrocarbons and surfactants. 
A composition according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that:
the rare earth oxide comprises a cerium oxide and, particularly, a selection of cerium 
oxide at least eighty percent (80 %) pure, and 
the average diameter of the particles of rare earth oxide ranges from half a micrometer 
(0.5 µm) to one micrometer and a half(1.5 µm). 
A composition according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the polysiloxanic oil 
has, at a temperature of twenty-five degrees Celsius (25 ° C), a viscosity of 10 to the 

power of minus four metres squared per second (10⁻⁴/ m²/s) and a surface tension of two 
hundred and nine thousandths of a newton per metre (0.0209 N/m). 
A composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 it contains a 
proportion of a thickening agent ranging from zero point one to twenty-five percent 

(0.1 % to 25 %) of the weight of the water-containing composition. 
A composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
polysiloxanic oil is a polymethylsiloxane oil. 
A composition according Claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that
 the thickening agent is of 
the non-ionic heteropolysaccaride type.  

 
A composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 it contains 
phosphoric acid. 
A composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 it contains 
phosphomolybdic acid. 
A composition according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that
 the 
proportions of the particular different components of the composition are, as a 

percentage of the total weight of the water-containing composition,: 

twenty percent (20 %) for the rare earth oxide, 
six percent (6 %) for the polysiloxanic oil, and 
ten percent (10 %) for the thickening and thinning agent of the polysiloxanic oil.
