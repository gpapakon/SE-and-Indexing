<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for heat dissipation from an internal space in a switch cabinet of a textile machine in a spinning mill or bobbin-winding mill. The object of the invention is to reduce considerably further the structural complexity for heat dissipation from the internal spaces in a switch cabinet of a textile machine in a spinning mill or bobbin-winding mill, which spaces are heated by the operation of electrical or electronic apparatuses. A feature of the invention is that the cooling air duct (K) is formed from a plurality of tubular segments (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). One tubular segment (Q1) is formed by arranging two invertor modules (30, 31) in a horizontal plane in a rack (13) of the switch cabinet (12).

A device for dissipating heat from the interior of a switch cabinet of a textile machine, 
which is heated by the operation of inverted-rectifier modules, wherein the said 

inverted-rectifier modules are inserted into insertion compartments of a switch cabinet, 
so that the cooling bodies of the inverted-rectifier modules are arranged in a cooling-air 

duct and the cooling bodies form a wall portion of the cooling-air duct and the cooling 
air conveyed in the cooling-air duct flows along the surface of the cooling bodies, 


characterized in that
 two inverted-rectifier modules (30, 31; 200, 300; 400, 500) with 
their cooling bodies (38, 39; 203, 303; 403, 503) are arranged 
per
 insertion compartment 
of a switch cabinet (13), so that all the wall portions of a tubular segment (Q1, 

Q10, Q100) are formed and the vertical arrangement of at least two segments form[s] a 

cooling-air duct (K). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the inverted-rectifier modules 
(30, 31) are arranged opposite each other but laterally offset. 
A device according to one or both of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that
 all the wall 
portions of a segment (Q1) are formed by the cooling bodies (38, 39), from the wall 

segments (62, 63) and from the front panels (54, 55). 
A device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the inverted-rectifier modules 
(30, 31) form a gap (S) between the cooling bodies (38, 39). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the inverted-rectifier modules 
(200, 300) are arranged in alignment with each other, so that the cooling bodies (203) 

and (303) thereof form a segment (Q10) with the wall segments (600, 700). 
A device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the inverted-rectifier modules 
(400, 500) are arranged in one insertion direction with each other, but one inverted-rectifier 

module is turned through 180Â°, so that the cooling bodies (403, 503) thereof 
form a segment (Q100).
