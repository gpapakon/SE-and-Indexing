<CLAIMS>
Bioadhesive pharmaceutical composition for the controlled release of an active
ingredient locally in the buccal cavity or systemically through a mucous membrane,

comprising:

an active ingredient,
a component (A) consisting of one or more copolymers formed by the copolymerisation
of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride or its derivatives,
a component (B) consisting of modified corn starch and, optionally, one or more
components selected from polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene

glycol, alginic acid and its derivatives, cellulose and its derivatives, gum arabic,
gum tragacanth, guar gum, xanthan gum, carob, carrageenates, cyclodextrins

and their derivatives, and
therapeutically acceptable excipients.
Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterised in that component
(A) consists of one or more copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride

or its derivatives in the form of acids, esters or calcium or sodium salts.
Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterised in that the
amount of component (A) is from 5 to 85 % of the total weight of the composition.
Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterised in that the
amount of component (B) is from 5 to 85 % of the total weight of the composition.
Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterised in that the active
ingredient is an anti-inflammatory or an analgesic acting either locally or systemically,

a disinfectant, an enzyme, a coronary vasodilator, an anti-asthma agent, an
antibacterial, an antibiotic, a cardiotonic, a local anaesthetic, an antianginal, an antiarrhythmic,

an antihypertensive, an anti-aggregating agent, an antitussive, an
expectorant, an antihistamine, a dopaminergic agonist, a sleep regulator, a haemostatic,

a hormone, an antitumour agent, an antimigraine agent, an anti-Parkinsonism 
agent, a pro-mnesic agent, an antidepressant, an anxiolytic, a hypnotic, an anti-diabetic,

an anti-obesity agent, an antifungal or an antiviral.
Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterised in that the
excipients are selected from the group of the diluents, the binders, the lubricants, to

which there may be added cotourings, flavourings, sweeteners, disintegrators or
absorption promoters.
Pharmaceutical composition according to claim 1, characterised in that it is in the
form of a tablet.
Tablet according to claim 7, characterised in that it is obtained by wet granulation
followed by compression.
Process for the preparation of the tablet according to claim 7, characterised in
that it is obtained by compressing a mixture consisting of:


an inner phase obtained by mixing the active ingredient, all or part of component
(B) and a diluent, followed by wet granulation,
an outer phase obtained by mixing component (A) and component (B), when all
of the latter has not been introduced into the inner phase,
optionally, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.
