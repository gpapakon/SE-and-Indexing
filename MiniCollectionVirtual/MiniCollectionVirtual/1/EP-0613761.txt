In the case of a mounting bed with a peripherally closed tubular frame carried by rollers, which is angled off over a partial length and fixedly bears, on cross struts fixedly connected to the tubular frame, a body support and a head support at a distance from the tubular frame, provision is made, for protection against floor draught and for injury-free usage, for the body support (6) and the head support (7) to be constructed in a manner butting against one another by the mutually facing edge faces (6',7') and to form jointly a continuous supporting surface for body and head.
