<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a process for the production of urea granules from a melt or solution of urea by spraying the urea melt or solution, which also contains as granulation additive formaldehyde, methylolureum, urea-formaldehyde precondensates, or hexamethylenetetramine, in the form of very fine droplets into a fluidized bed of urea particles, in which process the granulation additive is added prior to the granulation at such a stage, that the mixture of the said granulation additive and the urea melt or solution has a contact time of at least 20 s, but not more than 20 min.

<DESCRIPTION>
For the production of urea granules various methods 
are known. In the past prilling was the predominant method, 
wherein a substantially anhydrous urea melt ( having a water 
content of no more than 0.1 to 0.3% by weight) is sprayed 
from the top of a prilling column in a rising stream of air 
of ambient temperature in which the droplets solidify to 
form so-called prills. These prills nave a relatively small 
maximum diameter and are mechanically rather weak. Urea granules having larger dimensions and better 
mechanical properties are presently being produced by the 
granulation of a substantially anhydrous urea melt or of an 
aqueous urea solution in a fluidized bed, for example as 
described in US patent specification 4,219,589. In the 
process described therein, an aqueous urea solution having a 
urea concentration of 70 - 99.9 % by weight, preferably 85 - 
96 % by weight, is sprayed in the form of very fine droplets 
having an average diameter of 20 - 120 µm into a fluidized 
bed of urea particles at a temperature at which the water 
evaporates from the solution sprayed onto the particles, and 
urea solidifies on the particles to form granules having a 
desired size which may be 2.5 mm and more. As in this 
process rather large amounts of fly dust are formed, 
especially if the urea solution used as the starting 
material contains more than 5% by weight of water, in 
particular more than 10 % by weight of water, preferably a 
crystallization retarder or granulation additive for the 
urea, in particular a water-soluble addition or condensation 
product of formaldehyde and urea, is added to the urea 
solution, whereby the formation of fly dust is considerably 
lower, or even suppressed. The result of the presence of the 
granulation additive is that the granules remain plastic as 
they are being formed, so that owing to rolling and/or 
impacts during the formation mechanically strong, smooth and 
round granules may be formed.  
 The resulting granules have a high crushing strength, 
a high impact resistance, and little tendency of forming fly 
dust through abrasion, and moreover do not cake together, 
not even upon prolonged storage, although urea exhibits a 
strong natural tendency of caking together. Although the process of the cited US patent 
specification formed a large step forward in the properties 
of the urea granules, further improvement was still found to 
be necessary, especially with respect to the amount of fly 
dust of the final product and the dust formation during 
granulation. The

Process for the production of urea granules from a 
melt or solution of urea by spraying the urea melt or 

solution, which also contains as granulation additive 
formaldehyde, methylolureum, urea-formaldehyde 

precondensates, or hexamethyleentetramine, in the form of 
very fine droplets into a fluidized bed of urea particles, 

in which process the granulation additive is added prior to 
the granulation at such a stage, that the mixture of the 

said granulation additive and the urea melt or solution has 
a contact time of at least 20 s, but not more than 20 min. 
Process according to claim 1, wherein the said contact 
time is between 25 s and 15 min. 
Process of claims 1 or 2, wherein the amount of 
granulation additive is between 0.3 and 0.8 wt.% calculated 

as formaldehyde based upon the weight of the urea granules. 
Process according to claim 1-3, wherein the required 
contact time is provided by the presence of a buffer vessel 

between the mixing unit and the fluidized bed. 
Process according to claim 1-4, wherein the required 
contact time is provided by adding the granulation additive 

to an urea solution prior to the evaporation of water 
therefrom to provide the melt or solution to be granulated. 
Process according to claim 1-5, wherein the size of 
the very fine droplets is between 25 and 250 µm.
