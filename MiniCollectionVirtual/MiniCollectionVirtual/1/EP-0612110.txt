<ABSTRACT>
An embodiment of the present invention is an improved 
insulated-gate, field-effect transistor and a three-side, 

junction-gate field-effect transistor connected in series on 

the same chip to form a high-voltage MOS transistor. An 
extended drain region (26, 28; 46, 48) is formed on top of a 

substrate (11, 31) of opposite conductivity material. A 
layer (27, 47) of material with a conductivity opposite to 

that of the material of the extended drain region is buried 
within the extended drain region such that field-effect 

pinch-off depletion zones extend both above and below the 
buried layer (27, 47). A top layer (28, 48) of material 

similar to the substrate is formed by ion implantation 
through the same mask window as the extended drain region. 

The top layer (28, 48) covers the buried layer (27, 47) and 
extended drain region (26, 46) and itself is covered by a 

silicon dioxide layer (12, 32) above. Current flow through 
the extended drain is controlled by the substrate (11, 31) 

and buried layer (27, 47) when a voltage is applied to 
pinch-off the extended drain between them in a familiar 

field-effect fashion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to high voltage
metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistors and
more specifically to improvements that lower the inherent
on-resistance of high voltage MOS transistors.Insulated gate field effect transistors (IGFETs) or
MOSFETs are conventionally placed in series with junction
field effect transistors (JFETs) to make combination
devices that can switch high voltages and that have low
values of on-resistance. A lightly doped extended drain
region is used so that the voltage is sustained by an offset
gate. The voltage capability of such devices is determined
by the doping of the substrate, the length of
the extended drain region and the net number of charges
therein. Improvement in on-resistance is substantially
limited by the cross sectional area, length and degree
of doping in the extended drain region.United States Patent 4,811,075, issued March 7,
1989 to the present inventor, Klas H. Eklund corresponding
to EP-A-0 295 391 and to the preamble of
claim 1 and 3, describes an insulated-gate, field-effect
transistor and a double-sided, junction-gate field-effect
transistor connected in series on the same chip to lorm
a high-voltage MOS transistor. An extended drain region
is formed on top of a substrate of opposite conductivity
material. A top layer of material similar to the substrate
is formed by ion implantation. The top layer covers a
middle part of the extended drain. Current flow through
the extended drain is controlled by the substrate and top
layer which pinch-off the extended drain between them
in a familiar field-effect fashion.The extended drain region requires high levels of
doping to achieve acceptable levels of conductivity. The
resistance of the device when it is switched on will be
very much dependent on the dimensions of the extended
drain region and its doping concentration. Generally,
those adjustments in these parameters that improve on-resistance
will degrade voltage handling capability, and
vice versa.A lateral double-diffused MOS transistor device for
source follower applications is described in United
States Patent 4,626,879, issued December 2,1986, to
Set Colak. An intermediate semiconductor layer of the
same conductivity type as the channel region extends
laterally from the channel region to beneath the drain
contact region of a device. Colak states that this intermediate
semiconductor layer substantially improves the
punch through and avalanche breakdown characteristics
of the device, thus permitting operation in the
source-follower mode.
