<ABSTRACT>
A hinged lid cigarette pack includes a tab 60 foldably 
connected to the front wall 20a of the lid at the abutting edge 

between the lid front wall and the main front wall 20. The tab 
comprises a front tab panel 62 foldably connected to the lid front 

wall at the abutting edge and a top tab panel 64 foldably 
connected to the front tab panel via a first tab fold line. A 

back tab panel 66 is foldably connected to the top panel via a 
second tab fold line which is located opposite to the first tab 

fold line. When the lid is closed, the respective tab panels lie 
in a face-to-face contact with corresponding front, top and back 

walls of the lid. When the lid is open, the tab does not 
interfere with access to the cigarettes. At the desired time, the 

tab is extended such that the panels lie in substantially the same 
plane to read messages printed thereon. The consumer may then 

remove the desired number of tab panels by tearing along 
detachment lines. The front, top and back tab panels may be 

subdivided into additional tab panel sections 62a,62b which are 
interconnected via additional attachment lines. 
A blank for such a pack is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates to commonly assigned United States
Patent No. 5,236,084, issued August 17, 1993, which is hereby
incorporated by reference.This invention relates to cigarette packs, and more particularly to
cigarette packs in the form of boxes having a tab.Cigarette packs in the form of boxes are extremely well known. One
of the most popular forms of such boxes has an outer member which
includes a lower portion in which the cigarettes stand vertically. The
upper portion is a lid which is often, although not always, hinged to the
back of the lower portion so that the upper ends of the cigarettes are
exposed when the lid is tipped back to open the box to form the so-called 
hinged lid box. Such boxes typically have an innerframe inside the outer
member which extends up from the lower portion under the lid to provide
some interference with the lid as it opens and closes. This interference
helps to keep the lid firmly and neatly closed and reduoes the risk that the
lid will open accidentally.Cigarette packs of the foregoing type are relatively small and
strong. The visible exterior surfaces are needed for brand-identifying
information, contents specifications and required warning labels. There is
therefore little or no space on the outside of the pack for additional
information such as promotional coupons, and even if such additional
information could be put on the outside of the pack, it would be difficult
for the consumer to remove that information such as a coupon from the
pack. Placing coupons or other information separately in the pack is
disadvantageous because such placement necessitates additional
processing steps, additional production equipment and increased
production costs, and the consumer may not notice the information.The attachment of information bearing tabs has been proposed as a
solution to these problems. To be successfully implemented, this proposal
needs to be relatively straightforwardly adapted to conventional pack
formation techniques to avoid costly and time consuming modifications or
new machinery. In addition, the informative tab should not present any
obstacle to normal use of the product while still achieving its goal of
accessibility and easy removal at a desired time, e.g., at opening or any
time thereafter prior to closing the lid. It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a cigarette
pack having additional surface areas which can be used for a coupon or
other information.It is another object of the present invention to provide a removable
informa
