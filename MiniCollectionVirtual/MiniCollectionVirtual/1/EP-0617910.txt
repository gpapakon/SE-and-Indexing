<CLAIMS>
A kitchen appliance having a drive mechanism,
including a drive motor (4) and a transmission means (5)

with a tool output (14) for the coupling of different
tools (10, 33) adapted to be driven by the tool output

(14) at two different speeds of rotation at a given motor
speed,
characterized in that
 the transmission
means (5) is a variable-speed transmission (5)

having a sole axially displaceable output shaft (14)
providing the tool output, that the output shaft (14) is

movable by axial displacement from a first position in
which it is coupled to a first gear wheel (18), into a

second position in which it is disengaged from the first
gear wheel (18), being instead coupled to a second gear

wheel (17) or to the motor shaft, and that the coupling
member of the tool coupling means provided on the

different tools (10, 33) is positioned on the tool (10,
33) in such fashion that on fitting the tool (10, 33) the

output shaft (14) reaches the position predetermined for
the tool (10, 33).
The kitchen appliance as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that
 the output
shaft (14) is held in the first position by the force of

a spring (30), in which first position the output speed
is reduced and the output end (13) of the output shaft

(14) provided with a tool coupling means (12) protrudes
from the variable-speed transmission (5) a greater

amount.
The kitchen appliance as claimed in claim 2,
characterized in that
 the end (31)
of the output shaft (14) opposite the output end (13)

takes support upon a leaf spring (30) in an axial direction.
The kitchen appliance as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 the tools
(33) provided for axial displacement of the output shaft

(14) incorporate a thrust bearing attachable to the
housing of the kitchen appliance and positioning the tool

coupling means (11) in an axial direction.
The kitchen appliance as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 for coupling
the output shaft (14) a multi-tooth coupling is provided,

with the output shaft (14) including a coupling pinion
(22) with external teeth, and the gear wheels (17, 18)

including coupling bores (20, 21) with internal teeth.
The kitchen appliance as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 the variable-speed
transmission (5) includes a slow-speed back gearing

(27) having two pairs of gear wheels (17, 18, 29) which
are in continuous engagement with each other.
The kitchen appliance as claimed in any one of
the preceding claims,
characterized in that
 a high-speed
gear wheel (17, 24) mounted on the output shaft (14) is

connected with a worm gear (17, 23) which is in meshing
engagement with a worm (25) driven by the drive motor

(4). 
The kitchen appliance as claimed in claim 7,
characterized in that
 the internally
toothed coupling bore (21) is provided in the worm

gear (17, 24).
