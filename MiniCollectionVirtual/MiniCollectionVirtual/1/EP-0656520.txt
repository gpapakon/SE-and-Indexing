<ABSTRACT>
An entry/exit hatch on an armoured combat vehicle having a hatch cover (4) which can be unfolded from a closed position as far as a maximum open position. The hatch (3) is arranged in the transition region between a roof plate (1) and the adjacent downwards-inclined side wall (2) of the vehicle in such a manner that the hatch cover (4) pivots outwards during opening. A device for counterbalancing is provided on the hatch cover and has a rotating rod spring, one of whose ends is firmly connected to the hatch cover (4) in terms of rotation while the other end is fixed to the vehicle in such a manner that the rotating rod spring is prestressed in the opening direction when the hatch cover (4) is in the closed position, and is prestressed in the closing direction when the hatch cover (4) is in the maximum open position. The arrangement of the hatch and of the rotating rod spring result in a good free view being provided for observation even when the hatch cover (4) is provided with roof protection by means of passive armouring elements (9) and reactive armouring elements (10), and good counterbalancing being achieved both during the opening movement and during the closing movement of the hatch cover (4).

<CLAIMS>
An entry/exit hatch on an armoured combat vehicle with 
an armoured hatch cover, which can be pivoted open about a 

horizontal pivot axle from a closed position up to a 
maximum opening position, and a device for mass 

compensation at the hatch cover with a torsion bar spring 
lying in the pivot axle, one end of which spring is secured 

to the vehicle, whilst the other end is torsionally coupled 
to the hatch lid, characterised in that the hatch (3) is 

arranged in the transition region between a roof plate (1) 
and the adjoining, downwardly extending side wall (2) of 

the vehicle in such a manner that the pivot axle (4.2) of 
the hatch cover (4) lies on the outside of the hatch (3) 

and the hatch cover (4) pivots outwards during opening and 
passes through the vertical plane (V) containing the pivot 

axle (4.2) before reaching the maximum opening position 
(4'), and the torsion bar spring (5) is fixed to the 

vehicle in such a manner that it experiences a given degree 
of prestressing acting in the direction of opening in the 

closed position, is in its relaxed state in a given 
neutral, intermediate position and experiences a given 

degree of prestressing acting in the closing direction in 
the maximum opening position. 
An entry/exit hatch according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the plane of closure of the hatch (3) 

is inclined downwards and outwards. 
An entry/exit hatch according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the plane of closure of the hatch (3) 

forms an angle of approx. 30° with the horizontal. 
An entry/exit hatch according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the maximum angle of opening of the 

hatch cover is approx. 120°.  
 
An entry/exit hatch according to one of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that the hatch cover (4) can be locked in 

the maximum opening position (4') by a locking device (8). 
An entry/exit hatch according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
characterised in that the torsion bar spring (5) is coupled 

to the downwardly extending side wall (2) of the vehicle 
via a variable fixed bearing (7), at which the prestressing 

can be adjusted.
