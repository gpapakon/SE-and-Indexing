<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lateral bipolar 
transistor. There is already known a lateral bipolar transistor 
in which the current flows horizontally, namely parallel 
to the surface of the substrate. Such lateral bipolar 
transistor is widely used because of the advantage that 
it can be easily compatible with a vertical bipolar 
transistor in which the current flows vertically, namely 
in the direction of depth of the substrate. For example, 
a horizontal bipolar transistor of pnp structure can be 
loaded on the same substrate as a vertical bipolar 
transistor of opposite npn structure. However, the conventional lateral bipolar transistor 
has been associated with a drawback that the current 
amplification factor hFE cannot be increased because of 
the following reasons. This is due to facts that, because of a low emitter-collector 
breakdown voltage resulting from symmetrical 
arrangement of the emitter region and the collector 
region in such lateral bipolar transistor, the base width 
is apt to be influenced by the collector voltage 
resulting eventually in so-called Early effect (spreading 
of depletion layer), and that, because of wide internal 
spreading of the current flowing from the emitter into 
the base, the recombined current in the base region 
governs the function and the increased base current 
reduces significantly the current amplification factor  
 
hFE. In consideration of the foregoing, the present 
invention is intended to increase the current 
amplification factor of a lateral bipolar transistor. This problem has also been addressed by R.L. 
Thornton et al : IEEE Transaction on Electron Devices, 
36, No. 10., (1989) pages 2156-2164. Common features of 
the lateral bipolar transistor disclosed therein are 
recited in the preamble of the main claim appended 
hereto. The transistor disclosed, however, has a 
laminated structure comprising layers of AlGaAs and GaAs. 
Impurity-induced disordering via silicon diffusion is 
used to selectively convert a buried p-type GaAs layer 
into n-type AlGaAs regions that serve as the emitter and 
collector of the transistor. The active base layer, 
which is of narrower band gap GaAs, is completely 
submerged beneath the surface and therefore is not 
susceptible to device performance degradation due to 
surface recombination. The emitter and collector 
contacts are of Cr-Au. The high Si doping level in the 
Si diffused regions is relied upon to make ohmic contact 
to the emitter and collector. The lateral bipolar transistor of the present
