<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing cellulose acetate having 
excellent filterability, transparency and spinnability 

with the use of a a low grade pulp as the raw 
material, which comprises (1) using wood pulp of an α-cellulose 

content of 85 to 93% by weight as the 
cellulosic material, disintegrating the pulp and 

pretreating the disintegrated pulp with a solution 
containing 0 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts 

by weight of the disintegrated pulp, of an acetylation 
catalyst and a desired amount of acetic acid; (2) 

further adding the acetylation catalyst, if necessary, 
to adjust the amount of the catalyst in the 

acetylating system to 0.5 to 20 parts by weight based 
on 100 parts by weight of the disintegrated pulp and 

effecting acetylation; and (3) subsequently effecting 
hydrolysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing cellulose acetate, more particularly, to a 
process for producing cellulose acetate with the use 
of a low grade wood pulp sheet as the cellulosic 
material. Cellulose acetate, which is one of organic acid 
esters of cellulose and has been widely used in, for 
example, clothing fabrics, cigarette filter tips, 
plastics, films and coatings, has the largest output 
among cellulose derivatives and is highly important 
industrially. As a typical example of processes for 
industrially producing cellulose acetate, the so-called 
acetic acid process with the use of acetic 
anhydride as the acetylating agent, acetic acid as a 
diluent and sulfuric acid as a catalyst may be cited. Now the acetic acid process for producing 
cellulose acetate will be briefly described. This 
process comprises (1) a pretreatment step wherein a 
pulp material having a relatively high α-cellulose  
 
content is disaggregated and disintegrated, and acetic 
acid is sprayed thereon and mixed therewith; (2) an 
acetylation step wherein the pulp pretreated in the 
above step (1) is reacted with a mixed acid comprising 
acetic anhydride, acetic acid and an acetylation 
catalyst such as sulfuric acid; (3) a ripeness step 
wherein cellulose acetate is hydrolyzed to thereby 
give cellulose acetate of the desired degree of 
acetylation; and (4) an aftertreatment step wherein 
the ripe cellulose acetate is separated from the 
reaction mixture by precipitating, purified, 
stabilized and dried. There have been reported a number of techniques 
for improving these basic steps as described above 
from various viewpoints. The present invention 
relates to a process for producing cellulose acetate 
by using low grade wood pulp. From this point of 
view, the prior arts may be summarized as follows. In U.S. Patent No. 3,767,642 (published on 
October 23, 1973, Assignee; CELANESE CORPORATION), 
wood pulp of an α-cellulose content of 92 to 93% is 
subjected to a so-called slurry pretreatment by 
disintegrating into a slurry in a diluted aqueous 
solution of acetic acid and repeating dehydration and 
replacement with acetic acid. After acetylating by a  
 
known method, the sulfuric acid catalyst in the 
reaction system is completely neutralized and the 
reaction mixture is saponified and ripened at 125 to 
170°C, thus giving cellulose acetate which is 
excellent in transparency, filterability and 
spinnability. U.S. Patent No. 4,306,060 (published on Dec. 15, 
1981, Assignee; Daicel Chemical
