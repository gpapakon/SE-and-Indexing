<ABSTRACT>
An output buffer circuit is provided which significantly reduces 
ground/Vcc bounce and glitches of signals provided to an integrated circuit. 

The circuit includes a plurality of transistors for providing a drive potential at the 
output of the device. The transistors are coupled such that they increase in 

size from the input to the output of the output buffer circuit. A control circuit 
provides control signals for sequentially turning off the transistors from the 

largest to smallest device thereby substantially reducing the Vcc bounce and 
glitches of the signals provided to the integrated circuit by the output buffer 

circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to output buffer circuits such as 
an output buffer circuit for small computer system interface 
(SCSI) devices that will limit noise problems associated with such devices. An integrated output buffer circuit oftentimes receives digital signals from 
transmission lines to provide an input signal to a downstream integrated circuit. 
It is known that even though the ideal input signal is a rectangular signal which 
has straight edges, transmission line signals are noisy. Most common noise 
sources are ground/Vcc bounce on output buffers, reflection through 
transmission lines and cross-talk. When the noisy signals are received at 
integrated circuit inputs, these noisy signals produce false edges which can 
cause improper circuit operation. As is generally well known, in order to provide smaller and faster devices 
in CMOS process technology, circuits have a reduced scaling or a shrinking of 
the geometries thereof. For example, the channel length of the devices, which 
have been around 1.6 microns, are further reduced to under 1 micron so as to 
achieve higher speeds of operation. In particular, when the channel length of 
the device decreases, delay through the device will be reduced so as to yield 
faster device. However, the shrinking of the sizes of the integrated 
semiconductor devices to a smaller size has not been accomplished without 
any resulting problems. In general, the faster output transitions cause the 
higher ground/Vcc bounces and bigger reflection on the line. Such 
semiconductor devices of reduced dimensions fail generally from being more  
 
noise sensitive (i.e., lower noise immunity) and being not capable of providing 
reliable data transfer. One application where noise immunity and reliable data transfer 
becomes important is in the field of data transmission on a fully loaded Small 
Computer System Interface (SCSI) bus line which is coupled from a 
transmission line for communication in computer systems. The basic problem 
encountered when transferring data on the SCSI bus line is due to noise 
causing glitches. Glitches in the signal may cause double strobing of the data. 
The glitches are more hazardous when they appear on the request (REQ) and 
acknowledge (ACK) lines. The control signals REQ and ACK are used to perform a "handshake" 
in asynchronous mode so as to transfer the data back and forth between a 
target (for example, a disc drive) and an initiator (for example, a host 
computer). A glitch occurring in the control signal ACK can
