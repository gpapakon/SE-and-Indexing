<ABSTRACT>
A solar collector apparatus comprising a transparent 
surface (5) having a peripheral gasket (32), a housing (7) 

forming the bottom 
and sides of the collector and formed with an extension profile (4) 

along its upper edge including a ledge (12) on which the gasket (32) sits 
and a locking profile (18) operative to lock into the extension 

profile (4) and having a horizontal extension (24) 
forming a seal with the 

gasket.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to solar collectors in 
general, and especially to such solar collectors used in 
heating water tanks. Solar collectors generally comprise a rectangular 
planar structure including an insulated metal housing 
comprised in four side walls and a bottom side. The top side 
of the solar collector is a transparent, generally glass, 
surface. In use the solar collector is positioned so that 
the transparent surface is oriented toward the sun. Under 
the glass surface are rows of blackened pipes filled with 
water and positioned above a reflective inner surface, such 
that the pipes are heated by rays of the sun that pass 
through the glass surface. A rubber gasket generally abuts 
the glass surface at the inner edge of the metal housing to 
keep water out and to retain heat within the collector. 
Various screw-type retaining means are known in the art to 
secure the glass top to the housing. Connector elements 
protrude from locations on the sides of the collector for 
attachment to a water tank. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
improved solar collector having an improved mechanism for 
securing a transparent top to a housing of the collector. 
The housing has a rectangular box-like shape with an open 
side which is adapted to receive the top which is framed with  
 
a gasket. The improved mechanism for securing simplifies the 
assembly of the collector, provides an improved seal between 
the top and the metal housing, and provides a higher degree 
of safety during the use of the solar collector. The apparatus of the present invention preferably 
includes an elastomer gasket peripherally mounted on the edge 
of the transparent top. An extension profile extends upwardly 
along the edge of the housing. The extension profile 
includes a ledge on which the gasket sits and a vertical side 
portion running along the outer edge of the gasket. In 
addition, the extension profile includes a groove between the 
ledge and an external extension of the vertical side portion 
which extends below the ledge. The fitting of the elastomer 
gasket provides a tight seal to prevent heat from escaping 
from the solar collector as well as preventing penetration of 
water from the external surface of the collecter to penetrate 
to the interior. The apparatus preferably includes a locking profile 
adapted to lock onto the upper edge of the extension profile. 
The locking profile includes a lower flange adapted to fit 
into the groove of the extension profile and a web adapted 
to
