<ABSTRACT>
A modem (100), capable of simultaneously coupling voice and data 
signals, connects local digital terminal equipment (DTE) (102) and a local telephone 

(101) to a communications link (103). To prevent the local DTE from responding to 
a communications containing only voice signals, the local DTE (102) is notified of 

an incoming communication only after detection of calling tone signals on the 
communications link. Such signals indicate a remote DTE desires to establish a data 

communications path with the local DTE. This operation advantageously prevents 
the modem from transmitting an annoying answer tone to a calling party.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique for establishing a 
communications link between modems having the capability of simultaneously 
transmitting analog and digital signals. The ability to simultaneously communicate analog and digital signals 
through a communications channel is known. In one prior art technique, the voice 
and data signals are typically transmitted either via frequency-division multiplexing 
or time-division multiplexing. In frequency-division multiplexing, the data channel 
and the voice channel are allocated different sub-bands of the channel's bandwidth. 
Examples of that are U.S. Patent No. 4,757,495, U. S. Patent 4,672,602, and U. S. 
Patent 4,546,212. In time-division multiplexing arrangements, voice signals are 
sampled, digitized, and interleaved with digital data to form a single information 
stream which is communicated over the available channel. Practically every digital 
carrier system (e.g. the T1 carrier system) is an example of that. In another prior art 
technique set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,512,013, issued April 16, 1985, something 
akin to frequency division multiplexing is used to attain simultaneous voice and data 
half duplex operation. Finally, most recently, in a pending patent application 
entitled "Technique for Modulating Orthogonal Signals with One or More Analog or 
Digital Signals", serial number 08/076526, filed June 14, 1993, assigned to the 
present assignee, and incorporated herein by reference, the ability to simultaneously 
send voice and data or either voice or data alone through a communications channel 
in a nonmultiplexed manner using a generally coextensive frequency band is 
disclosed. With any of the foregoing techniques, a modem interconnects an 
associated telephone and data terminal equipment (DTE) to other remote telephones 
and DTEs via a communications link. This link is typically part of the public 
switched telephone network (PSTN). In any event, there is a need for the modem to 
appropriately interact with its associated telephone and DTE for incoming calls. For 
incoming calls, such interaction involves providing an off-hook signal to the 
communications link and ringing the phone for voice calls, or appropriately 
forwarding the incoming data to the DTE or a combination of both of these 
functions. One prior art technique for providing this interaction for a 
communication simultaneously coupling voice and data requires that the  
 
communication be established by using an application program which activates a 
modem's
