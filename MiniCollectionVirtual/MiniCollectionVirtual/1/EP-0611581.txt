<ABSTRACT>
The tube carrier apparatus (1A) is composed of carrier 
rails (2, 3), at least a pair of rollers (5, 5) provided so as 

to pinch a flexible tube (30) therebetween, and a driving 
section (6) for rotating the rollers (5, 5). The carrier 

rails (2, 3) are formed with a groove (4) as a passage for the 
tube through which the tube is to be carried in the 

longitudinal direction thereof. When the motor (6) is driven, 
both the rollers (5, 5) are rotated in two different rotative 

directions, so that the tube (30) is pinched between the 
rotating rollers (5, 5) and the tube is then carried in 

accordance with the rotation of the rollers. The tube carrier 
apparatus is simple in structure and small in size. 

Alternatively, the apparatus (1B, 1C, 1D, 1E) comprises at 
least one first passage (81, 131, 181, 221) through which the 

tube is adapted to pass, a plurality of second passages (71, 
72; 141, 151; 171, 191; 231) through which the tube is to be 

carried, a switching member rotatably or movably disposed 
between the first and second passages and a driving mechanism 

(10, 21) for rotating or moving the switching member (9, 16, 
20, 24) and including a connection passage (91, 92; 161, 162; 

201, 202; 241) for selectively connecting the first passage 
and any one of the second passages. The switching member (9, 

16, 20, 24) is rotated or moved by the driving mechanism (10, 
21) to select connection between the first tube passage (81, 

131, 181, 221) and any one of the second passages (71, 72; 
141, 151; 171, 191; 231).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tube carrier 
apparatus for carrying a flexible tube along a passage. In various bags, for instance such as a blood 
(collecting) bag for collecting blood or a blood component bag 
for collecting plasma, blood platelet, red blood cells, etc. 
which have been separated from blood by centrifugal 
separation, there is provided at least one flexible tube which 
is connected at one end thereof to the bag in order to 
introduce or discharge blood or blood component into or out of 
the bag. When such bags as described above or multiple bags are 
manufactured or fluid is automatically transferred through 
such a tube as described above, the tube connected to the bag 
is transported to a predetermined position, and the 
transported tube is sealed, cut off or connected to another 
tube or another member at the predetermined position. As an automatic tube carrier apparatus, an apparatus 
which carries a tube by so-called pick and press method has 
been so far well known. The apparatus is provided with a 
carrier head movable in two or three different dimensional 
directions. A chuck which chucks an end of the tube is 
mounted on the carrier head. The carrier head is movable to a 
predetermined destination to carry the chucked tube. In the 
prior art tube carrier apparatus as described above, however, 
there is such problems in that the mechanism for moving the 
carrier head is complicated and thereby the apparatus becomes 
large in size. In particular, in order to keep the tube shape 
unchanged between before and after the tube is carried by the 
prior art apparatus, the tube must be chucked at a plurality 
of different positions. Therefore, when the total length of 
the tube to be carried is large, the number of the chucks is  
 
inevitably increased, with the result that the carrier head 
becomes massive in size and thereby the carrier apparatus 
becomes large in size. In addition, there is a case that a tube must be 
selectively carried to two or more predetermined destinations. 
In a case where such a need is arisen in the prior art tube 
carrier apparatus, since all the tube carrier heads must be so 
constructed as to be movable within a range in which a 
plurality of predetermined destinations are included, the 
mechanism becomes further complicated and the size thereof 
becomes also large. In addition, the moving sequence of the 
carrier heads becomes complicated. Furthermore, in the prior 
art apparatus, there is another problem that it takes a 
relatively long time to
