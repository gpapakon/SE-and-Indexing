<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating a device using a micromachined tool (5) that 
has openings (7) which receive and align components (3) with respect to each other 

and a substrate (1). The tool (5) has fiducial marks (9) which align to fiducial marks 
(9) on the substrate (1) thereby producing precise alignment of the tool (5) and the 

substrate (1). The components (3) are inserted into the openings (7) thereby insuring 
their alignment with respect to the substrate (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods for fabricating a device which include 
the use of a micromachined tool to obtain passive alignment of components of the 
device with respect to each other on a substrate. Many technological fields require the attachment of one or more 
components to a substrate with a precise alignment with respect to each other and the 
substrate. Electrical or optical signals or power may be transferred from, for 
example, the substrate to the component or between components. The components 
may be either electrical or optical devices and may be either active or passive 
devices. For example, integrated circuit chips must be aligned with respect to circuit 
boards so that they may be soldered or otherwise connected to an electrically 
conducting pattern on the circuit board. As another example, optical fibers or lenses 
must be aligned with respect to each other or with respect to a light source so that 
light may be transmitted through the fibers or lenses. The devices may then be 
soldered or otherwise aligned and attached to the substrate. In some instances, both 
optical and electrical signals or power will be transferred between devices and 
substrate. As might be expected, a variety of techniques has been developed to 
position the two or more components with respect to each other and the substrate. 
Perhaps the conceptually simplest technique may be termed pick and place. One 
component is picked up and then placed on the substrate in the proper position with 
the desired alignment with respect to other components. After components are 
placed on the substrate, they are permanently attached to, for example, solder bumps 
on the substrate. Photolithographic techniques are frequently used to define the 
solder bumps. These techniques are capable of great precision. The simplest pick 
and place technique is done manually; more sophisticated techniques use machines 
and are highly automated. The pick and place technique is limited to relatively 
coarse, that is, imprecise, alignments, of components. Thus, pick and place 
techniques do not have the accuracy that lithographic techniques can achieve. Self-aligned techniques have been developed in attempts to overcome 
the problems described above with respect to the accuracy attainable with pick and 
place techniques and obtain component alignment more precise than that attainable 
with pick and place techniques. There is also the expectation that, for a given 
alignment accuracy, self-aligned techniques will be less expensive than
