<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is applicable to a process for 
burning an emulsion of water and a fuel oil, with a 
high heat-generating yield, including the procedures 
to obtain and stabilize this emulsion, under adequate 
conditions for the proposed burning process. Such a process is known from documents US-A-3 876 363 
and US-A-4 430 054. The optimization of burning together with the 
inherent economy of fuel obtained, has been, over 
the years, a permanent concern of those responsible 
for manufacturing and/or operating heat-generating 
units, as well as of the suppliers of fuels, that 
is, the distributors of oil products. By this token, 
numerous papers have been developed by the involved 
parties, as well as in the field of emulsifying fuel 
oil with water. However, whether due to the 
operational sequence, or whether due to the process 
conditions adopted, in spite of the high degree of 
technological development reached in heat-generating 
equipment, relatively little progress has been 
reached in the last two decades in terms of fuel 
economy, whereas the most relevant results obtained 
do no more pertain changes in the fuel itself, but 
are due to a more accurate control of burning, 
obtained through the aid of computer technology. Concerning the techniques of emulsifying fuel oil 
and water, instant emulsification, emulsion 
additivation, as well as an endless number of 
mechanical and/or chemical modification processes 
were developed aiming at, among other parameters, 
the possibility of adding, under stable conditions, 
larger amounts of water to emulsions, in order to 
obtain yields of heat at least equal to fuel oil in  
 
terms of mixture with air. However, the most efficient known processes for 
hydro- emulsifying fuel oil have provided gains in 
heat yields at an average of about 3%, or at a 
maximum between around 5 and 8%, if compared with 
the yield by burning a perfectly adjusted air/oil 
mixture. Even for those who are not familiar with the art, it 
must seem intuitively evident that, if adequately 
used, the ideal adjuvant of fuel oil in terms of 
costs is water. By this token, and taking as a basis the knowledge 
of the art then available, the applicant, for the 
first time, decided to develop persevering studies 
with the purpose of optimizing process conditions 
related to each operational stage of hydro-emulsification. 
The records presented, for the 
first time, references to improved stability 
characteristics and heat value of hydro-oily 
emulsions for burning in burner nozzles
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Hydro-oily emulsion burning process 
characterized in that it comprises the steps of: - 

emulsifying and aerating the water and the fuel oil, 
by means of agitation in a mixing tank, the water 

being maintained at a minimum temperature of 20°C ± 
2°C and the fuel oil at a maximum temperature lower 

than that of vaporization of water and at an 
adequate working pressure to facilitate the desired 

emulsification, the concentration of water in the 
emulsion being calculated to react 

stoichiometrically during combustion, producing 
hydrogen and carbon dioxide, said emulsion being 

maintained at a temperature sufficient to permit an 
interfacial tension between fuel oil and water and 

air at compatible levels to stabilize the emulsion 
and at a pressure corresponding to a temperature of 

saturated water steam substantially higher than the 
temperature of the emulsion, so that the latter 

presents all the water maintained in the form of 
droplets of around 1 to 10 microns uniformly 

dispersed, together with micro bubbles of air, in 
the fuel oil, the speed and time of agitation being 

determined in order that the aerated emulsion 
obtained presents a specific gravity around 20% ± 5% 

lower than the deaerated hydro-oily emulsion; 

stabilizing the aerated emulsion in a rest tank, 
maintained under temperature and pressure condition 

that ensure the required ratio of interfacial 
tension between water and oil and maintenace of the 

water concentration, for a period of time required 
and sufficient to practically fully deaerate said 

emulsion: 
conducting the deaerated and stabilized emulsion  
 

to a burner nozzle, maintaining the emulsion 
temperature between a maximum value 

corresponding to that of a saturated steam pressure 
mandatorily lower than the emulsion 

pressure and a minimum value corresponding to the 
minimum sensible heat stored within the emulsion capable of vaporizing 

around 5% to 20% of water under an abrupt pressure 
drop of the emulsion on injection into the combustion 

chamber, the pressure of the 
emulsion being maintained within the operating 

values required by the burner; 
pulverizing the emulsion through the burner, in 
uniform particles of around 20 to 150 microns, each 

particle comprising a plurality of said water 
droplets in the emulsion, surrounded by a film of 

oil, said pulverization being effected so as to 
provoke an abrupt depressurization of the emulsion, 

sufficient to cause the instantaneous vaporization 
(flashing) of part of the water from the droplets 

and the consequent disintegration of the particles 
of the pulverized emulsion, said pulverization being 

effected in an environment sufficiently poor of air 
in order to avoid direct formation of carbon dioxide 

and to convey the following reactions: 

a - partial combustion of the fuel oil with part of 
the oxygen available in the pulverization 

environment, forming carbon monoxide and releasing 
heat; 
b - reduction of water vaporized during the abrupt 
depressurization of the emulsion, by means of a 

stoichiometric amount of part of the referred carbon 
monoxide, forming carbon dioxide and hydrogen and 

releasing heat; 
c - oxidation of hydrogen, from reaction b, with the 
remaining oxygen available in the pulverization 

environment, forming hiperheated water steam at  
 

burner flame temperature ; 
d - vaporization of water, remaining in the 
droplets, by the heat produced in reactions a and b; 
e - reduction of water vaporized in reaction d by 
the carbon monoxide remaining from step a, through 

chain reactions identical to reactions b and c, in 
order to provoke total combustion (burning) of the 

oil.
