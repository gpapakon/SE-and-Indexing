<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally 
to analog, bidirectional switch cells which have particular 
utility in subscriber line circuits. 
However, the various embodiments of the 
analog bidirectional switch cell of the present invention have 
application in a myriad of other circuits, and may be 
considered a variable resistor. Low voltage, discrete component, bipolar junction 
transistor, bidirectional analog signal switches are known in 
the prior art. With reference to the prior art circuit shown 
in Figure 201, discrete NPN Transistors Q1 and Q2 have been 
connected in a common emitter configuration with the collectors 
serving as the switch terminals S1 and S2 and with current 
sources I1 and I2 connected between the base and emitter of the 
transistors Q1 and Q2, respectively, to control the conduction  
 
thereof. In operation, the conduction of the transistors Q1 
and Q2 is controlled by the base-to-emitter bias supplied by 
the current sources I1 and I2. See, for example, "Chopper 
Transistors", Sperry Applications Engineering Department, 
November, 1960. To enable the switch to operate without offset (i.e., with 
a symmetric I/V curve passing through the origin), the 
transistors Q1 and Q2 must be well matched, as must the two 
current sources I1 and I2. The switch is able to block 
voltages only up to the BVCES of the transistor connected to the 
more positive switch terminal and in known switches is 
generally limited to 40 volts, and occasionally 60 volts, by 
transistor manufacturing techniques. The current sources I1 and I2 may float with the voltage 
across the switch terminals S1 and S2. As is known, current 
sources I1 and I2 inject excess carriers into the transistors 
Q1 and Q2, forward biasing both emitter-base and collector-base 
junctions. The excess carrier concentration builds up until 
the recombination current exactly equals the current source 
current. Since the current sources I1 and I2 introduce as much 
current at the base of the transistors Q1 and Q2 as they remove 
from the emitters of the transistors Q1 and Q2, they add no 
offset current to the switch, and known transistors are 
operated in saturation to keep the switch impedance low and 
linear. If the switch terminal S1 is more positive than the switch 
terminal S2, switch current will flow in the direction shown in 
the drawings and may be one to two orders of magnitude larger 
than the current sources I1 and I2. As is apparent, transistor 
Q2 operates in the reverse direction, i.e., with switch current 
is coming
