<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a woven machine clothing comprising at least two warp thread systems (3, 5) and one weft thread system (4). Characteristic of the invention is that the two warp thread systems (3, 5) have been interlaced with each other by thread twisting alternately clockwise (at 4b/6b) and counterclockwise (4f/6f).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a woven fabric 
for use in papermaking, cellulose manufacturing or like 
machines, said fabric comprising at least two systems 
of warp threads and at least one system of weft threads. In the making of paper in a papermaking machine, an 
aqueous slurry of fibres is flowed on to a horizontally 
moving forming fabric or into the nip between two running 
forming elements, of which at least one is a forming fabric. 
A major portion of the aqueous content of the fibre 
slurry is dewatered through the forming fabric, and a 
coherent paper web is formed thereon. The formed paper web 
is transferred on a press felt into a press section, where 
more water is squeezed from the web in one or more press 
nips. Finally, the paper web is transferred to the drying 
section of the papermaking machine, where, by engaging hot 
cylinders, it is dried by evaporation of the moisture. The 
web is brought into engagement with the drying cylinders 
by means of a dryer fabric. In the forming of the paper web, the fibre slurry, 
commonly known as the stock, generally contains above 
99% water, of which the major part should be removed by 
allowing the water to flow through the forming fabric. 
The throughflow of water takes place in the parts of the 
forming fabric where the thread material therein does 
not obstruct such passage. It is however vital that the 
throughflow areas are very limited, i.e. the fabric must 
be very fine-meshed, to avoid fibre losses and paper 
markings, but at the same time the permeability of the 
forming fabric must be sufficient to allow substantial 
amounts of water to pass through. Thus, the fabric surface 
next to the fibre web must be fine-meshed, with 
many, small throughflow areas, which means that the fabric 
material must consist of thin threads. At the same 
time, the fabric must be wear-resistant and dimensionally 
stable, which means that additional and generally coarser  
 
thread material must be included in the forming fabric. 
This combination of desired properties has been achieved 
by using several thread systems in one or both directions 
of the forming fabric. When the paper web is formed on the surface of the 
forming fabric, this must be done without reflecting the 
design of the forming fabric in the paper sheet in the 
form of a so-called wiremark, which is caused by a nonuniform 
forming surface. In forming fabrics having 
several thread systems in one or both directions, these 
thread systems must be interlaced without interfering 
with the

<CLAIMS>
Woven fabric for papermaking and cellulose manufacturing 
or like machines, comprising at least a first 

(3; 13) and a second (5; 15) system of warp threads and 
at least a first system of weft threads (4; 14), said 

first warp thread system (3; 13) interlacing with said 
first weft thread system (4; 14), 
characterised
 
in that adjacent warp threads from said first 

(3; 13) and said second (5; 15) warp thread system twist 
around each other alternately clockwise (at 4b/6b; 14b) 

and counterclockwise (at 4f/6f; 14j) in such a way that 
each such adjacent warp thread from the first warp 

thread system (3; 13) interlaces with said first weft 
thread system (4; 14) between two subsequent twists, 

whereby said first and second warp thread systems are 
bound to each other at each twist position. 
Woven fabric as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised
 
in that at least one weft thread is 

inserted between a first thread twist and a subsequent 
retwist. 
Woven fabric as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 
by at least a second weft thread 

system (6) interlacing with said second warp thread 
system (5). 
Woven fabric as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised
 
in that said first warp and weft 

thread systems (3, 4) interlace with said second warp 
and we
ft thread systems (5, 6) only by said thread 
twisting of the warp thread systems. 
Woven fabric as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterised
 
in that said second warp thread 

system (15) does not interlace with any weft thread 
system. 
Woven fabric as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterised
 in that said  
 

first warp and weft thread systems (3, 4; 13, 14) are 
intended to form the fabric top cloth (1, 11) facing a 

paper web. 
Woven fabric as claimed in claim 6, 
characterised
 
in that the top cloth (1, 11) 

facing the paper web is intended to directly engage the 
paper web.
