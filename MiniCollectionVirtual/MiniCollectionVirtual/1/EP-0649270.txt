<ABSTRACT>
The vessel includes:     - a tank (3) and an internal refractory lining (12) of the tank; - a bottom electrode (2) extending through the bottom wall (10) of the tank (3) and the lining (12) and comprising, superposed:   - a bar (22) which is flush with the refractory lining; - an adaptor (24) fixed under the bar (22), internally cooled, having a diameter less than that of the bar and connected to this bar by its upper front surface (28) at a level located in the thickness of the refractory lining (12) and - a ring (30), integral with the tank (3) which surrounds the adaptor (24) and the upper face (36) of which is located under the bar in order to support it.   In order to prevent liquid materials from penetrating by infiltration between the bar and the ring, the bar is extended towards the bottom wall (10) in a skirt (38) which laterally surrounds the adaptor (24).   The invention applies in particular to DC arc furnaces of steelworks.

Metallurgical vessel comprising:

a tank (3) and an internal refractory lining
(12) for the tank;
a bottom electrode (2) passing through the
bottom wall (10) of the tank (3) and of the lining (12)

and comprising, so as to be superposed, a bar (22)
which is flush with the surface of the refractory

lining and, fixed beneath the bar (22), an internally
cooled end-piece (24) which has a smaller diameter than

that of the bar and is linked to the latter via its
upper transverse surface (28) at a level lying within

the thickness of the refractory lining (12), the said
electrode being able to be moved downwards;
a support ring (30), fastened to the tank
(10), which surrounds the end-piece (24) and the upper

face (36) of which ring lies beneath the bar and
elastic return means (40) for returning the
electrode downwards,
characterized in that
 the bar (22) is extended towards
the bottom wall (10) by a skirt (38) which surrounds

the end-piece (24) laterally.
Vessel according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the internal diameter of the skirt (38) is greater
than the external diameter of the end-piece (24) and

the ring (46) penetrates upwards between the skirt and
the end-piece.
Vessel according to Claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 an annular space (50) of external diameter at
least equal to that of the skirt is left between the

lower edge of the skirt, the ring and the refractory
lining.
Vessel according to either of Claims 2 and 3,

characterized in that
 the upper end face of the ring
(46) lies substantially level with the upper transverse

surface (28) of the end-piece. 
Vessel according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the ring (30) lies beneath the lower edge of the
skirt (38).
Vessel according to Claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the skirt (38) is in contact with the end-piece (24).
Vessel according to any one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
 the ring (30, 46) includes cooling means.
Vessel according to any one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized by
 the elastic return means (40) exerting on the bottom electrode (2) a return force directed towards the outside of the vessel.
Vessel according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 it is a DC arc furnace for treating metalliferous materials especially for the smelting of steel.
