<ABSTRACT>
A combustion method wherein high velocity fuel is 
injected into a cavity (4) recessed from a furnace zone (10) for 

flow into the furnace zone, low velocity oxidant fluid 
is injected into the cavity for coaxial flow with the 

fuel, and the resulting combusting fuel and oxygen has 
imparted to it an angular component by operation of 

swirling oxygen flow and/or outwardly angled fuel flow, 
enabling control of the high velocity flame length.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method
for carrying out combustion in conjunction with a high
temperature combustion zone.High temperature combustion is often employed in
many industrial processes such as in glassmelting.
Corrosion and fouling of burner nozzles are common
problems in high temperature industrial processes.
Water cooling of metallic nozzles is often used to
prevent high temperature corrosion or melting.
Although water cooling is effective in a relatively
clean furnace atmosphere, it adds to the complexity of
the combustion system and also could escalate the
corrosion and fouling problem when the furnace
atmosphere contains condensible vapors. Ceramic
nozzles have been proposed for use with high
temperature combustion as a way for avoiding water
cooling. However, presently available ceramic nozzles
tend to develop cracks due to thermal and other
stresses and are not considered dependable for many
industrial applications. The problem of designing a
non-water cooled burner is particularly severe where
the burner employs oxygen or oxygen-enriched air rather
than air as the oxidant because of the high flame
temperature generated.High temperature combustion may be carried out by
injecting fuel at a high velocity into a furnace zone
as this enables the major part of the combustion
reaction to be well away from the nozzle or fuel 
injection point. Furthermore the fuel injection may
occur in a cavity communicating with the furnace for
further protection of the nozzle. Other heat
protection steps include employing a flame detached
from the burner nozzle and operating within a cavity
having an expanded flow area. However, high velocity
fuel injection may cause the generation of an
excessively long flame length.A combustion method according to the preamble of claim 1 and 5, respectively, is known from
US-A-4 986 748. A similar combustion method is known from US-A-3 836 315. In both of
these known combustion methods the flame is kept away from the tip of the nozzle in order to
protect the tip from detrimental effects of the flame temperature. From US-A-5 100 313 a
combustion method in a cylindrical cavity is known, wherein an oxidant is injected in divergent
streams. The oxidant velocity in this known process is 45.7 m/s (150 feet/s) for an oxidant
comprising 30% oxygen.It is an object of this invention to
provide an improved combustion method which may
effectively employ high velocity fuel injection for
carrying out high temperature combustion without the
need for water cooling of the fuel injection
