<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an insulating tape or
sheet. More specifically, the present invention relates to an
insulating tape or sheet suitably used, in particular, as an
insulating material etc. for an insulated wire to be used for
electric wiring in electric equipments, electronic equipments
and automobiles, and indoor and outdoor wirings.Conventionally, an insulating tape or sheet has been used
for covering a conductor in an electric wire for insulating and
protecting same. It comprises an adhesive layer formed on a
polyester film, which is a substrate for the tape or sheet.
Various adhesives such as polyolefins, thermosetting resins and
polyester adhesives have been used for the aforementioned
adhesive layer.Of the aforementioned adhesives, polyolefin adhesives are
advantageous in that they do not cure at room temperature,
permitting easy handling thereof, and are most inexpensive in
cost.When an insulating tape or sheet having a polyolefin
adhesive layer is used as an insulating material for an
insulated wire to be used under severe conditions in the
electric system of, for example, an automobile, however, the
wire is susceptible to trouble due to the deformation and 
breakage of the wire, which is caused by a physical impact.
When the wire is used in a bent state for a long time,
moreover, the insulated wire experiences insulation failure due
to the partial separation of the insulating layer from the
adhesive layer in the insulating tape or sheet, or between the
tape or sheet and the conductor, or due to the occurrence of
crack in the tape or sheet, posing problems to be solved.US-A-3,750,081 discloses a variable resistance control
comprising a metal and an insulation tape. The insulation
tape is exemplified by a polyester and the adhesive for the
metal is disclosed to be polyethylene.Accordingly, the present invention aims at providing an
insulating tape or sheet having a polyolefin adhesive layer
permitting low production cost, which is usable as an
insulating material for an insulated electric wire free of
trouble or insulation failure even if it is used under severe
conditions.The present invention aims at providing an insulating tape
or sheet useful as an insulating material for the above-mentioned
insulated wire, the tape or sheet being particularly
superior in adhesiveness under high temperature conditions
(heat resistance) and in the presence of water (hot water)
(water resistance). The present invention further aims at providing an
insulating tape or sheet useful as an insulating
