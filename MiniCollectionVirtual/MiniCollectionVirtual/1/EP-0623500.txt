<ABSTRACT>
In order to avoid transferring goods from shopping trolleys to paper or plastic bags and the like, according to the invention a collapsible basket is proposed which fits into normal supermarket shopping trolleys. The basket, when it has been opened out and arranged in the shopping trolley, is filled with goods and then removed in the filled condition and put into a car without having to transfer the goods individually and without requiring additional disposable packaging for conveying them. In order, despite the internal dimensions of the shopping trolleys not being cuboidal, to make possible an object which can be collapsed so that it is completely flat, the side walls of the basket are subdivided into three separate trapezoidal parts which are hinged to one another, with an additional fastening part in the upper central region of the longitudinal sides.

<CLAIMS>
A collapsible basket having a tetragonal floor part (2), two tetragonal longitudinal side 
parts (3) and two tetragonal narrow side parts (4), adjacent side parts being hinged with 

each other, each of the longitudinal side parts (3) being hinged with the floor part and 
the basket (1) being essentially adapted, and adaptable to, the interior dimensions of 

conventional mobile shopping carts in supermarkets and the like, characterized in that 
the two longitudinal side parts (3) opposing each other consist of at least three hinged 

parts, including a longitudinal middle part (5) and two longitudinal end parts (6), the 
longitudinal middle part (5) having a lower edge (8) which corresponds to the 

longitudinal edge of the floor part (2) and is hinged therewith, slanted edges (9) of the 
longitudinal middle part (5) approximating each other by running in a slanted upward 

direction, and each longitudinal end part (6) having an outer edge (10) hinged with the 
outer edge of the adjacent narrow side part (4) and a slanted edge (9) hinged with the 

slanted edge of the adjacent longitudinal middle part (5), which allows for a parallel 
position of two hinged parts respectively in which their surfaces contact each other. 
A basket according to claim 1, wherein the narrow side parts (4) are interconnected 
by at least one longitudinal belt (19). 
A basket according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the narrow side parts (4) increase in 
width, in the manner of a trapezoid, from the bottom to the top. 
A basket according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein at least one of the 
longitudinal side parts (3) has at least one locking device (7) which fixes the stretched, 

flush positions of the longitudinal middle part (5) and the longitudinal end parts (6) of a 
longitudinal side part (3) relative to each other and, hence, the unfolded state of the 

basket (1).  
 
A basket according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the longitudinal middle 
part (5) is shaped like a trapezoid, the lower edge (8) forming the base of the trapezoid. 
A basket according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the longitudinal end parts 
(6) are shaped like trapezoids, the outer edge (10) forming the base of the trapezoid. 
A basket according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the maximum height of 
the longitudinal side parts (3) is half the width of the floor part (2) and the maximum 

height of the narrow side parts (4) is half the length of the floor part (2). 
A basket according to any of the preceding claims, wherein a tetragonal locking 
element (17) is arranged in the upper middle area of each longitudinal side part (3) in 

the unfolded state of the basket (1) between the trapezoid-shaped longitudinal middle 
part (5) and the trapezoid-shaped longitudinal end parts (6). 
A basket according to claim 8, wherein the locking element (17) consists of at least 
one elastic tension strand (12) lying in the plane of the longitudinal side part (3) in its 

unfolded state, running approximately parallel to the upper edge of the longitudinal side 
part (3) and being able to accomodate tension forces. 
A basket according to claim 8, wherein the locking element (17) is plate-shaped and 
stable in itself, as well as rectangularly formed and centrally arranged in the upper area 

of the longitudinal middle part (5), being parallel displaceable with regard to its height 
and in the plane of the longitudinal middle part, so that in the upwardly shifted state 

there is additionally formed a positive lock between the side edges (18) of the locking 
element (17) and the inner side edges of the longitudinal end parts (6). 
A basket according to claim 8, wherein the locking element (17) is plate-shaped and 
stable in itself, as well as rectangularly formed and centrally arranged in the upper area 

of one of the longitudinal end parts (6), being parallely displaceable in a longitudinal  
 

direction and running parallel or in the plane of the longitudinal middle part, so that in 
the shifted locked state there is additionally formed a positive lock between the locking 

element (17) and the upper area of the longitudinal end part (6). 
A basket according to claim 8, wherein the locking element (17) is plate-shaped and 
stable in itself, as well as rectangularly formed and centrally arranged in a hinged 

manner on the upper edge of the longitudinal middle part (5), so that in the upwardly 
folded state there is additionally formed a positive lock between the locking element 

(17) and the longitudinal end parts (6). 
A basket according to any preceding claim, wherein a longitudinal belt (19) 
longitudinally extends along the floor part (2), the ends of which belt are fixedly 

connected to the lower areas of the two narrow side parts (4), wherein the load carrying 
capacity of the floor part (2) is improved by the tension of the longitudinal belt (19) and 

wherein the longitudinal belt (19) passes from a relaxed to a tense state by unfolding the 
basket. 
A basket according to any preceding claim, wherein the longitudinal side parts (3) 
increase in width, in the manner of a trapezoid, from the bottom to the top.
