<ABSTRACT>
The connector for fluid circuits, particularly the 
coolant circuit of an internal combustion engine (10), 

comprises a hose (16) of elastomeric material and at least one clamping clip 
(24), shaped as a ring (26) which can be opened along a 

generatrix and having means (28, 30) for varying the 
diameter of the ring (26). In its external surface 

adjacent at least one end, the hose (16) has a 
circumferential groove (20) in which at least one 

locating pin (22) projects radially. At least one 
hole (32) is formed in the ring (26) of the clip (24) 

so that, when the ring (26) of the clip (24) is 
positioned in the groove (20), the locating pin (22) 

enters the hole (32) in the ring (26), locating the 
clip (24) angularly relative to the hose (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connector for fluid 
circuits, particularly the coolant circuit of an 
internal combustion engine, comprising a hose of 
elastomeric material and at least one clamping clip, 
shaped as a ring which can be opened along a 
generatrix and having means for varying the diameter of 
the ring (US-A-5 185 913). During the fitting of known devices of the type 
indicated above, once an end of the hose has been 
fitted onto a union of another component of the 
circuit, the clip is wrapped around this end of the 
hose and is then tightened to prevent leakage of fluid 
between the hose and the union. According to the prior art, in order to carry out these 
operations, the hoses and clips are made to arrive at 
an assembly station separately and are then joined 
together, considerably increasing storage and assembly 
costs. In order to prevent this problem, the subject of the 
present invention is a connector of the type indicated 
above, characterized in that, in its external surface 
adjacent at least one end, the hose has a 
circumferential groove in which at least one locating 
pin projects radially, and in that at least one hole is 
formed in the ring of the clip so that, when the ring 
of the clip is positioned in the groove, the locating 
pin enters the hole in the ring, locating the clip 
angularly relative to the hose. The device according to the invention can thus be  
 
stored and then supplied to an assembly station as a 
single, preassembled item in which the loosened ring of 
the clip is positioned in the groove of the hose with 
the locating pin inserted in the hole in the ring. This ensures that the clip is positioned correctly 
relative to the hose both axially and 
circumferentially. Moreover, it prevents the person employed in fitting 
the hose on the union and subsequently tightening the 
clip from wasting time on any correction of its 
position, and from fitting it incorrectly, for example, 
so that the plane defined by the ring is not 
perpendicular to the axis of the hose. Further advantages of the present 
invention will become clear from the detailed 
description which follows with reference to the 
appended drawings provided purely by way of 
non-limiting example, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of the connector 
according to the invention, fitted in a cooling system 
of the internal combustion engine of a motor vehicle, Figure 2 is a perspective view of the connector 
according to the invention, comprising a hose and a 
clip in the assembled
