<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to powder coating. More
particularly, the invention relates to powder coating guns
which are assembled in a lightweight, hollow housing that
is readily adapted for mounting to a programmable,
industrial robot. The hollow housing can be adjustable
and/or the powder coating guns can be adjustably mounted
within the hollow housing so that the direction and/or
shape of the powder spray pattern can be controlled. An
air purge system may also be included to clean the powder
coating guns of coating powder.Coating guns are typically mounted on programmable
industrial robots for use in automated production lines.
The robots are advantageous for applying an even coating
of powder to irregular shaped articles. The robots can be
programmed to coat articles with different configurations
and to coat successive articles different from previously
coated articles. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,798,341,
discloses an improved coating gun, according to preamble of claim 1, for mounting on a
programmable industrial robot. This patent is directed to
the application of a liquid spray by a single coating gun. Normally, a wrist component is attached to the end
of the robot arm for mounting the coating gun. The arm
moves to position the coating gun in space and the wrist
component provides two or three axes of motion for aiming
the coating gun relative to the end of the robot arm.
However, there is a limit to the weight which can be
mounted to the end of the robot arm without interfering
with the operation of the robot. Also, the robot mounted
guns are typically not easily removed from the robot and
sometimes require excessive system downtime for repairs.US Patent No. 4228958 describes a spray device
according to preamble of claim 8,
which may be mounted, together with another such device,
on a paint spray unit carried on the support arm of a
robot by a wrist assembly. The wrist assembly includes a
gear unit for rotating the spray unit relative the support
arm.In certain powder coating applications, it is
desirable to provide two coating guns within a single
housing so that the desired spray pattern is formed with
a desired direction and/or shape. While the provision of
twin guns in a single housing is known, the guns have
typically been secured within the housing in a single
position. When an operator desires to change the
direction or adjust the shape of the spray pattern, the
housing is typically removed from the robot arm and
replaced with a different housing wherein the two guns
are repositioned to
