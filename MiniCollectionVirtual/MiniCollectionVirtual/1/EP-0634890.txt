<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging structure 
for a microwave circuit, and more particularly to a 
packaging structure including a microwave circuit module 
or microwave IC module. As well known, the wavelength of a microwave or 
millimeter wave region is short and, therefore, it is 
difficult to design a circuit arrangement including 
transmission lines while suppressing discontinity on 
the lines to a low level and ensuring isolation between 
circuits or lines. Therefore, microwave circuit packaging 
has necessarily been intricate and costly. In recent years, 
a microwave monolithic integrated circuit (abbreviated 
as MMIC hereinafter) is becoming gradually applied as a 
semiconductor integrated circuits in the high frequency 
band. However, the MMIC has many drawbacks. For example, 
it is generally easy to crack so that many packaging 
restrictions exist. In particular, it is not adapted 
to integration of distributed constant circuits which 
tend to result in large sizes. Referring to Fig. 8 showing a packaging structure 
for a conventional microwave circuit including an MMIC, 
an MIC module 101 having a circuit element 103, microwave 
leads 102 and bias supply terminals 107 therein are  
 
arranged on a main plate 100. Here, the microwave leads 
102 and the bias supply terminals 107 are led to the rear 
side of the main plate 100 by going through outer conductive 
holes 109 formed therein. The bias supply terminals 107 
are soldered via a printed circuit board or the like, and 
the microwave leads 102 are electrically connected to 
another module or an isolator 108 by soldering via the 
printed circuit board 104. The connected parts of the 
microwave leads 102 are shielded by means of a cover 106 
isolated from the outside. As shown in Fig. 8, since the MMIC's are unsuitable 
for integration of a distributed constant circuit 
constituted mainly of passive elements, active elements 
are sealed in an airtight case and connection between 
these active elements and the outside passive elements 
is established by microstrip lines and by soldering. 
Therefore, the sealing of the MMIC into an airtight case 
is costly, and an intricate and expensive shielding case 
having finely compartmentalized small chambers is 
required to prevent undesirable electrical connection 
between unit circuits. Further, the cost for 
assembling runs high. Accordingly, the above-mentioned conventional packaging 
structure has the following defects. (1) A considerable 
cost has to be spent for building in an MMIC into
