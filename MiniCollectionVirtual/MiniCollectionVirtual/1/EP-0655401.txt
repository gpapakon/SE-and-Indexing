<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device is described for transferring objects (14), in particular printed circuit boards, from a horizontal plane determined by a storage device (12) into a vertical end position determined by a carrying frame (18). For this purpose, a gripping device (16) is provided which has suction heads (22). A first drive device (30) serves to raise the gripping device (16) parallel to the horizontal plane. A second drive device (34) is provided for pivoting the gripping device (16) and thus the at least one object (14) about a horizontal pivot axis (26). In this process the at least one object (14) is pivoted beyond the vertical plane. The object (14) which has been pivoted out beyond the vertical position is then moved in the horizontal direction with respect to the carrying frame (18) using the first drive device (30). Subsequently, the object (14) which is pivoted beyond the vertical position is pivoted into the vertical position using a third drive device (32), in which vertical position the at least one object (14) is then clamped tight between at least one lower clamping device (42) and at least one upper clamping device (44) of the carrying frame (18), and electrical contact is made with it.
