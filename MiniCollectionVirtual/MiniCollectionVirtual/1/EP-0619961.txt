<ABSTRACT>
Securing device (1) for securing two flap portions 
(5,6) of a sports shoe, including: a lever arm (7) with a 

pair of wings (8a,8b) interconnected by a crossbase (16) at 
one end thereof and provided with pivots (10a,10b) at 

another end thereof; a traction element (12) connectable at 
one end to a first flap (5) and pivotally connected at 

another end to a middle zone (11a,11b) of the wings of the 
lever arm; and a baseplate (17) connectable to a second 

plate (6) and provided with: a pair of protruding curved 
teeth (23a,23b) at one end of the baseplate for pivotally 

accommodating the pivots (10a,10b) of the lever arm; and a 
quadrangular protruding lug (28) at another end of the 

baseplate for catching between the crossbase (16) and wings 
(8a,8b) of the lever arm in a closed position thereof. A 

pair of seats (30a,30b) are provided in the upper surface of 
the baseplate (17) to the sides of the lug (28), and the 

lever arm is provided with a pair of shoulders (14a,14b) 
which engage in the seats (30a,30b) when the lever arm is 

closed. The curved teeth (23a,23b) of the baseplate also 
include first inclined planes (24a,24b) which engage, when 

the lever arm is closed, with complementary inclined planes 
(25a,25b) defined on the lower surface of the lever arm (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a securing device
particularly usable in sports shoes such as ski boots, ice
skates or roller skates.Many kinds of levers used to secure the quarters, the
shell or the uppers of sports shoes, such as for example ski
boots or ice skates and roller skates, are currently known.U.S. patent No. 3,295,177 discloses a securing lever
for a boot comprising a combination of features as included
in the precharacterising portion of the appended claim 1,
and having in particular a lever arm that is provided with a
set of teeth in a downward region and is arrangeable, at one
end, at a shoulder associated with the upper and protruding
along a plane which is inclined with respect to said upper.The lever arm is connected to a ring for securing a
flap by means of an adapted metallic plate that keeps the
ring facing the set of teeth.This embodiment, in addition to requiring various steps
for the assembly of the components of the lever which
increase its production costs, does not have optimum impact-resistance
characteristics, especially against impacts
occurring along an axis which is transverse to said lever
arm.Such impacts can in fact disengage the lever arm from
the shoulder, consequently eliminating the securing action,
or break the components.Swiss patent no. 596,784 discloses a ski boot provided
with levers that comprise a lever arm having, in a downward
region, a set of teeth with which a metal ring interacts; at 
its other end, said ring interacts with the boot flap to be
secured or with quarter securing bands.The lever arm has, at one end, a pair of tabs between 
which a pivot for pivoting the lever arm is located; said
pivot is arrangeable at an adapted seat formed on an
elastically deformable tab.Even this embodiment has drawbacks, since any impact
affecting the lever arm axially may cause the pivot to
leave its seat, thus causing disengagement or breakage.The possible use of a screw to fix the elastically
deformable tab would only partially solve the problem, since
it would create a weaker region that might give way if
stressed repeatedly.Furthermore, the use of a screw locks the lever arm in
its position.Similarly, impacts affecting the lever arm transversely
to its longitudinal median axis might entail the breakage of
the elastically deformable tab, thus eliminating the
securing action.French patent no. 2,410,449 discloses an improved
fixing device for ski boots and the like, which comprises a
lever arm provided with a set of teeth in a downward region
and, on the side

<CLAIMS>
Securing device (1), particularly for sports shoes

(2) such as ski boots or skates, comprising a lever arm (7)
to which the end of a traction element (12) is idly pivoted,

the other end of said traction element being connectable
with said shoe, said lever arm having first means (10a,10b)

for temporary pivoting to engagement means (23a,23b)
provided on a baseplate (17) that is associable with said

shoe, the securing device being characterised in that said
lever arm (7) is U-shaped with a pair of wings (8a,8b) and a

base (16) interconnected between the two wings, and there is
further provided on the lever arm second means interacting

with the base plate (17) for withstanding axial stresses,
and third means for withstanding lateral stresses comprising

a lug element (28) protruding from the outer surface of the
base plate (17) and being approximately as wide as the

interspace between said wings (8a,8b).
Securing device according to claim 1, associable
with a sports shoe comprising a shell (3) which has a front

opening and thus a first flap (5) and a second flap (6) to
be secured or at least one quarter or upper to be secured,

said lever arm (7) comprising a single U-shaped body in
which the tips of the wings (8a,8b) have a curved and

preferably a half-cylindrical shape.
Securing device according to claim 2, characterized
in that thinner portions or recesses (9a,9b) are formed at

the mutually facing surfaces of said ends of said wings, a
pair of cylindrical pivots (10a,10b) protruding at said

recesses coaxially to said tips, said pivots being 
approximately as high as said recesses are deep, and having

the same axis as said recesses.
