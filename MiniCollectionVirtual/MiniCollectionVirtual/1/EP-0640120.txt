<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous composition for etching and cleaning semiconductor devices comprises a solution of an acid and a surfactant which is a branched chain aliphatic amine having the formula CmH2m+3N, where m is an integer from 7 to 10. The compositions are stable for long periods of time and do not suffer foaming problems when used in recirculation filtration systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with etching compositions
useful in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. More
particularly, this invention concerns etching compositions
containing an amine surfactant.Historically, compositions comprising ammonium
fluoride, hydrofluoric acid and de-ionised water have been
used for etching and cleaning substrates at various
process stages during the fabrication of semiconductor
devices. As device geometries have decreased, making them
more sensitive to process deviation and contamination, it
has become essential for etch uniformity to be enhanced
and contamination reduced.It is difficult to define structures below five
microns in size using the above wet etching compositions
due to their nonuniform etching properties. This problem
is related to the physical wetting of the low surface
energy substrates used, e.g. photoresists. Mixtures of
ammonium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid typically exhibit
relatively high surface tension properties of
approximately 80-90 dynes/cm at 25°C (higher concentration
ammonium fluoride mixtures exhibit even higher surface
tensions). The result of this property is the inability
of the mixture to penetrate small geometries and uniformly
etch the substrate. For ammonium fluoride and
hydrofluoric acid mixtures to be useful for etching small
geometries, it is necessary to modify their surface
wetting properties.Semiconductor manufacturers presently utilise two
methods to improve surface wetting and etch uniformity.
The first involves the use of an acid pre-dip solution
comprising a surfactant in de-ionised water. The second
involves the direct addition of a surfactant into the acid
etch bath.The pre-dip process, however, results in regular 
changes of the acid etchant due to carry-over of the pre-dip
solution into the etch bath which subsequently causes
dilution, resulting in etch variation.The addition of a surfactant directly to the etch
bath also suffers problems related to the solubility of
the surfactant in the highly ionic environment exhibited
by the ammonium fluoride/hydrofluoric acid mixtures. This
is detected as a visual clouding of the etch tank solution
caused by the surfactant remaining in suspension. This
problem becomes more apparent as the industry moves from
stagnant to recirculating-filtration tanks in an effort to
reduce particle contamination. The surfactants which are
not entirely soluble in the mixtures tend to be removed by
the filtering system, resulting in a detrimental increase
in the surface tension of the mixtures.Many
