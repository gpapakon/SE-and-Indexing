<ABSTRACT>
A gear machine (pump or motor) is proposed which has two pairs of gear wheels (22, 23) which are separated from one another by an intermediate plate (24). The gear wheels (16 to 19) have grooves (35) running axially in the shaft bores (34) of the gear wheels (16 to 19). By means of the grooves, the leakage oil arising in the through holes (26, 27) of the intermediate plate (24) can be discharged in a simple manner. As a result, furthermore, operation of the gear machine in both operating directions is possible. In addition, the entire leakage oil system is simplified, compared to known gear machines.

<CLAIMS>
Gear machine with two gear pairs (22, 23) which 

are separated from one another by an intermediate plate 
(24) and the gears (16 to 19) of which, which mesh 

externally, have shaft bores (34), the gears (16 to 19) 
being arranged on a drive shaft (28) and a shaft (33) 

parallel to the latter, the two shafts (28, 33) being 
connected to one another by a connecting passage (37), 

characterized in that the gears (16 to 19) each have at 
least one slot (35) extending in the axial direction in 

the shaft bore (34) of the gears (16 to 19) over the 
entire width of the gear in order to allow the leakage 

oil to flow off. 
Gear machine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the slots (35) have a semicircular cross-section. 
Gear machine according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the slots (35) are formed in the region 

of the teeth (21) of the gears (16 to 19). 
Gear machine according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the shafts (28, 33) are mounted in 

bushes (41), in the inner wall of which relief slots (43) 
are formed. 
Gear machine according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the connecting passage (37) emerges 

in the connection cover (13) in the region of a shaft 
sealing ring (29) for the drive shaft (28). 
Gear machine according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that a leakage oil connection (38) is 

formed in a cover (12), and the relief slots (43), the 
slots (35) and the connecting passage (37) thus form a 

through connection for the flow-off of the leakage oil.  
 
Gear machine according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the gears (16 to 19) are produced 

by a sintering process.
