<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor device including a clock 
driver which provides clock signals, a plurality of 

electronic elements which are operable in timed relation 
to the clock signals, provided are a plurality of 

lattice-shaped wiring blocks to which the electronic 
elements are connected and each of which has a center 

portion, and an interconnecting wiring pattern connected 
to the center portion. The interconnecting wiring 

pattern connects the clock driver with the center portion 
of each lattice-shaped wiring block so that a distance 

between the clock driver and each center portion is 
substantially equal to one another in the center 

portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device
which may be incorporated in an LSI circuit or the like.A conventional semiconductor device of the type
described comprises a large number of electronic
elements, such as flip-flops, and the like, and a clock
driver which delivers clock signals to the electronic
elements through a wiring pattern between the electronic
elements and the clock driver.It is preferable that the clock signals are
delivered to all of the electronic elements without any
difference of a delay time, namely, a delay time
difference. Such a delay time difference is generally
called a clock skew. However, it is practically
difficult to completely get rid of the clock skew because
of differences of lengths of the wirings.In order to reduce such a clock skew, it has
recently been proposed that the wiring pattern is formed
into a lattice-shape. Such a lattice-shaped wiring
pattern is exemplified in Unexamined Japanese Patent
Publication No. Shô 63-107316, namely, 107316/1988, and in
EP-A-0 501 652, which discloses a so-called balanced
tree clock distribution network for an integrated
circuit. In the interim, it is a recent trend that an
integration scale in the semiconductor device becomes
larger and larger and that a frequency of the clock
signals becomes higher and higher.Under the circumstances, it is inevitable that
the wiring pattern becomes long. Furthermore, it
sometimes happens that an error operation is caused to
occur by a timing error which results from the
above-mentioned clock skew.The clock skew becomes large with an increase of
the integration scale, which causes the error operation
to frequently occur.Although consideration is made in the
above-referenced publication only about the clock skew
which occurs in a single wiring pattern, such a clock
skew might become serious when a semiconductor device
comprises a plurality of wiring patterns in the form of
wiring blocks.It is therefore an object of this invention to
provide a semiconductor device
and a clock signal distribution network
which can reduce a clock
skew even when a plurality of wiring blocks are included.Other objects of this invention will become clear
as the description proceeds.According to an aspect of this invention, there is provided
a semiconductor device 
as defined in claim 1. According to a further aspect of the
present invention, there is provided a clock signal distribution network
as defined in claim 5. Preferred embodiments of the present
invention are defined independent claims 2 to 4 and 6.Fig. 1
