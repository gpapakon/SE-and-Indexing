<ABSTRACT>
The infrared detector contains a sensor element (1) and, connected downstream therefrom, an evaluation circuit with an amplifier (3), an analog/digital converter (4) and a microcontroller (6). The microcontroller (6) contains a pulse-processing stage (5) where the digitised sensor signals are converted into pulses, and a fuzzy controller (7) to which these pulses are fed. In the fuzzy controller (7), in each case a plurality of sequential (successive) pulses are compared with rules which are stored in the form of linguistic variables.

Process for processing the signals of a passive infra-red
detector, which generates electrical signals,

described below as sensor signals, in relation to
incident infra-red radiation, then evaluates these

electrical signals, wherein the sensor signals are
digitized and processed in the form of pulses, whose

evaluation is carried out by means of fuzzy logic (7),
wherein in each case the data of a series of several

pulses are compared to rules stored in the form of
linguistic variables, characterised in that the pulses

are characterised by data, wherein as characterising
data for describing the pulses, their amplitude and/or

duration are used, and that for the conversion of the
digitized sensor signals into pulses the waveform of

the signals is examined, and at a certain excursion of
the signal from its normal position a pulse start is

set and on return to the normal position a pulse end
is set.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that,
as characterising data for describing the pulses,

their polarity and/or their mutual spacing are used.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that, in each case the data of the last n successive

pulses are compared with the stored rules, where the
value of n lies between 2 and 4, and is preferably 3.
Infra-red detector for implementing the process
according to Claim 1, having at least one sensor

element for generating the sensor signals and having
an evaluation circuit for processing and evaluating

them, which contains a fuzzy controller (7) to which
the pulse data are fed, characterised in that the

fuzzy controller (7) contains a rule base (8) and an
inference machine (9) and forms part of a

microcontroller (6), which contains a pulse processing 
stage (5) for processing the digitized sensor signals

in pulses and for storing the data describing the
amplitude and/or duration of the pulses.
Infra-red detector according to Claim 4, characterised
in that the rules stored in the rule base (8) of the

fuzzy controller (7) are of the type that their
condition part contains number and data of pulses and

the time interval of the occurrence of the pulses.
Infra-red detector according to Claim 4 or 5,
characterised in that the inference machine (9) of the

fuzzy controller has a FUZZY-AND function as the
operator.
