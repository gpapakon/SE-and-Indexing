<ABSTRACT>
A door has a door leaf (10) which may be moved overhead between an open and closed position and which is connected by means of a traction cable system to a weight-balancing device, driving motor or another similar power source. The traction cable system has at least one cable unit (21) secured at one end to the door leaf and fixed at the other end. In order to dispense with catching means and ensure a longer service life, at least one of the cable units (21) has two cables (21', 21'') loaded approximately in parallel and combined by their associated ends each to a building element. At least one of said building elements is designed as a cable tension compensating device.

<CLAIMS>
A door, for example a lifting door, a sectional up-and-over
door, a roller door, a tilting door or a

swing-door, with an up-and-over door leaf (10)
which can be moved between a closed and an open

position and which is connected to a motor drive
apparatus or similar power source by means of a

traction cable with a counterweight mechanism (15),
this traction cable having at least one cable unit

(21) for each side of the door leaf, one end of
which is fixed in position, wherein the cable unit

or at least one of the cable units (21) contains
two cables (21', 22") which are loaded

substantially in parallel and which are combined in
each case with the ends which are assigned to one

another to a component (22, 43) in each case, the
cables being disposed extending substantially

parallel between their ends which are held, in each
case, on common components (22, 43), characterised

in that the at least one cable unit (21) is
connected to the door leaf by its other end and

that at least one (43) of the two components is
configured as a cable tension compensation

apparatus (41-43).
A door according to claim 1, characterised in that
the cable tension compensation apparatus (41-43) is

configured as a rocker (41) which is swivellably
mounted in a central area about a fixed spindle

(42) and which has a fixing formation (43) on both
sides of the spindle (42) for one of the cable ends

in each case, preferably configured in the manner
of a hanger formation e.g. Bowden cable fixing of a

thickened cable end (44) in a recess of the fixing 
formation (43) in the rocker (41) extending in the

cable direction.
A door according to claim 2, characterised in that
the fixing formations (43), viewed from the cable

ends (44) placed therein, in the direction of the
downward-extending cables (21', 21"), are provided

on the rocker (41) in front of the spindle (42)
thereof.
A door according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in
that the angle of swing of the rocker (41) is

limited, preferably by an abutment on a shoulder
(49) of the fixed supporting part which holds the

spindle (42).
A door according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the cables (21', 21") are

guided around return pulleys (25) in the course of
their extension, these pulleys being configured as

pairs of rollers or double-grooved rollers.
A door according to claim 5, characterised in that

the return pulleys (25) with their rotational axle
mounting are connected to the one end of one or

more helical spring units (16) of a weight
compensation apparatus (15), their other ends being

fixed in position.
A door according to claim 6, characterised in that
the fixed position (26) of the cable ends is formed

with alterable lengths in the axial direction of
the spring, especially on the respectively-associated

rail (14), preferably in the form of a
row of openings (45) along the length of the rail,

optionally for selectable fixing of the spindle
(42) of the rocker (41). 
A door according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in
that the building-side fixing (28) of the spring

units (16), with alterable lengths in the axial
direction of the spring, especially on the

respectively-associated rail (14), preferably in
the form of a row of stamped holes (40) along the

length of the rail in which an anchor (37) can
selectively be inserted on the spring side,

preferably with two lugs (38, 39) extending away
from one another in the axial direction of the

spring, of which the one which faces away from the
spring unit (16) is longer than the other and/or

the one which faces away from the spring unit (16)
has a bore hole.
A door according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the helical spring unit has

one or more compression springs.
A door according to one of claims 6 to 9,
characterised in that the or at least one of the

helical spring units (16) comprises at least two
parallel-loaded driven helical springs (17, 18), of

which the inner spring (17) in each case has a
smaller spiral outer diameter (Da) than the spiral

inner diameter (Di) of the respective outer spring
(18) which are arranged coaxially in one another or

enclosing one another and that seen from the same
direction of the spring longitudinal axis, the

spiral of one spring tends to the left and the
spiral of the respective adjacent spring tends to

the right, so that the spirals (20) of adjacent
springs (17, 18) cross.
