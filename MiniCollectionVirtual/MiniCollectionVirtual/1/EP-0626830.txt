<ABSTRACT>
A device for delivering a filling material into a tooth cavity, including a grip portion (1) having a first cavity (3), and an end portion (2) having a second cavity (4), a plunger (7) dividing the second cavity (4) into two compartments (8, 10), a transmission rod (11) housed in the second compartment (10) and connected to the plunger so as to impart thrust thereto, a control rod (12) housed in the first cavity (3) and interacting with the transmission rod (11) as it slides towards its end of travel position, and a return means (18) for returning the control rod to its starting position. Said control and transmission rods are interconnected by releasable means (23) which cooperate as the control rod is returned to its starting position.

A device for applying filling material 
into a dental cavity, comprising : 


a main body including a grip portion (1) having a 
first cavity (3) and a tip portion (2) having a 

second cavity (4), 
coupling means (5, 6) provided on the grip portion 
(1) and on the tip portion (2) and cooperating in a 

detachable way, which coupling means permit, when 
cooperating together, a communication between said 

two cavities (3, 4), 
a piston means (7) dividing the second cavity (4) 
into a first and a second compartment (8, 10), the 

first compartment (8) being destined to receive the 
filling material and communicating with the outside 

through an opening (9) in the tip portion (2), the 
piston means (7) being slidable within the second 

cavity (4) between a first position removed from said 
opening and a second position wherein it reaches or 

possibly projects out of this opening (9), 
a transmission rod (11) housed in the second compartment 
(10) and connected to the piston means (7) 

to transmit a pushing force thereto for displacing 
it between its first and second position, 
an operating rod (12) slidably housed in the first 
cavity (3) between a rest position and a terminal 

stroke position, said operating rod (12) cooperating 
with the transmission rod (11) when sliding towards 

the terminal stroke position to transmit said 
pushing force thereto, and 
a return means (18) for returning the operating rod 
(12) to its rest position, 
 
characterised in that the operating rod (12) and the 

transmission rod (11) comprise mutually detachable 
connection means (23, 24, 25) which cooperate such as to  

 
transmit also a return force when returning the operating 

rod (12) to its rest position. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the tip portion (2) and the transmission 

rod (11) connected to the piston means (7) are disposable 
elements to be disposed of aft
er each use. 
A device according to either one of 
the claims 1 and 2, characterised in that both the tip 

portion (2) and the transmission rod (11) have a length 
greater than the distance between any tooth of a patient's 

mouth and his lips. 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the tip portion (2) 

is curved and the transmission rod (11) shows a corresponding 
curvature. 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that both the tip 

portion (2) and the transmission rod (11) are straight. 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that said coupling means 

(5, 6) may be mutually coupled or detached without 
influencing the cooperation between said connection 

means (23, 24, 25). 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 6, characterised in that said coupling means 

(5, 6) consist of an outer thread (6) on one extremity 
of the tip portion (2) and an inner thread (5) on the 

corresponding extremity of the grip portion (1), and in 
that said connection means (23) of the transmission rod 

(11), the transmission rod (11) itself and the piston 
means (7) can rotate freely around their axis upon 

screwing said coupling means (5, 6). 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 7, characterised in that said detachable 

connection means (23, 24, 25) comprise a projection (23) 
provided on one extremity of the transmission rod (11)  

 
or of the operating rod (12) and a recess (24, 25) 

provided on one extremity of the operating rod (12) or 
of the transmission rod (11) wherein the projection (23) 

can penetrate radially to be housed therein without 
possibility for axial movement in the recess (24, 25). 
A device according to claim 8, characterised 
in that said projection consists of a flange 

(23) provided on said extremity of the transmission rod 
(11), in that said recess consists of an axial cavity 

(24) provided in said extremity of the operating rod 
(12) and having a cross-section corresponding to the 

diameter of the transmission rod, in that said axial 
cavity (24) broadens (in 25) at its extremity removed 

from the extremity of the operating rod (12) to achieve 
a cross-section corresponding to the one of said flange 

(23), and in that it has a lateral opening permitting 
the transmission rod (11) equipped with its flange (13) 

to be inserted radially. 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the tip portion (2) 

is curved to a degree depending on the tooth to be 
filled. 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the tip portion 

(2) includes, on its extremity opposed to the grip 
portion (1), means for fixing a cupule (29) with a 

curable resin known per se. 
A device according to any one of the 
claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the tip portion 

(2), the transmission rod (11) and the piston means (7)

A tip portion (2) of a device for 
applying filling material in a dental cavity according 

to any one of the claims 1 to 13, comprising a cavity 
(4) and coupling means (6) destined to cooperate in a 

detachable way with coupling means (5) provided on the 
grip portion (1), characterised in that, prior to 

mounting it on the grip portion, it contains, in the 
cavity (4), the piston means (7) dividing this cavity in
