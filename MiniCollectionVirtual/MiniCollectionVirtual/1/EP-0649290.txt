<ABSTRACT>
An electrosurgical tubular trocar system (10) has a hollow tube (13) substantially longer than its diameter. The tube (13) is shaped for insertion in a direction generally along its axis through tissue of a human or animal body. Distal and proximal ends (17 and 18) on the tube (13) enter and remain outside the tissue, respectively. A tip (19) on the distal end (17) punctures tissue of a human or animal. An insulating portion (20) of high dielectric material extends along the tube (13) between the distal and proximal ends (17 and 18). An electrode (14) on the insulating portion (20) extends from the proximal end (18) to the tip (19) to transmit radio frequency energy. A tip point (19) at an acute angle to the axis lessens the initial force necessary for entry of the tube (13). The return path (16) is a conductor (23) on the insulating portion (20) for bipolar cutting across a gap (25). An alternate system may have the return path (16) as a conductive pad (15) in contact with the tissue as a monopolar circuit. The tube (13) may be in fluid communication for flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
An electrosurgical tubular trocar to cut tissue of a human or animal,
and more specifically the electrosurgical tubular trocar for coring a tunnel through
tissue and coagulating the tissue passage made thereby.Surgery through a trocar inserted cannula and particularly with an
opening through the tissue of an animal or human abdominal wall has become an
important means to minimize the extent of surgical invasion. The lessening of
invasion improves the cosmetic result, shortens recovery and lowers the cost.
Endoscopic internal surgical procedures and equipment are available and in use for
a variety of medical operations including gall bladder, bowel and gynecological
surgery. A proper and simple instrument to open the passage through the abdominal
wall and provide a passage for surgical instruments such as laparoscopes,
endoscopes and the like is needed.U.S. Patent No. 3,336,916 has a biopsy cannula to remove tissue and
electrosurgically coagulate upon withdrawal.U. S. Patent No. 3,595,239 discloses a catheter tube having an obturator
in the form of an electrode passing coaxially therethrough. The obturator electrode
is connected to an electrosurgical generator in order to provide high frequency
energy used to divide or cut tissue thereby forming a passage for the catheter
coaxially about the obturator to pass therewith through the tissue. The tip of the
obturator extends beyond the catheter tip and cuts the path for the over the
obturator catheter. The catheter moves along with the obturator electrode by means
of a ring disposed about the obturator proximal to the tip and inside the tip of the
catheter. There is no disclosure of an electrosurgical tubular cutting element for
opening a passage.A copending application, WO-A-9313718, was published on 22/07/93
and is assigned to a common owner. The disclosure in that application
has a 
means for sensing the impedance or load associated with the energy required to do
the cutting during insertion of an obturator tip so that the energy may be
automatically ceased when the load has changed meaningfully. That approach is
useful with the electrosurgical tubular trocar disclosed herein because safe use of it
may be augmented by the combination of the circuitry described therein with the
trocar explained in this disclosure.U. S. Patent 4,232,676 has a knife blade which cuts and cauterizes the
incision and in so doing self limits the current flow at the knife. Specifically, the flat
scalpel like blade carries electrodes therewith. Across the electrodes current flows
