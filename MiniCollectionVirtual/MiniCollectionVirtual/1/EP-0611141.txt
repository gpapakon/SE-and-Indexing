<ABSTRACT>
Propellant formulations are provided which include non-toxic 
burn rate modifiers. In order to produce a usable propellant 

formulation, it is necessary to control the burn rate of the 
propellant. Failure to adequately control the propellant burn rate 

often results in unacceptable performance of the propellant. It has 
been found that Group IIA metal salts, such as calcium carbonate 

and strontium carbonate, are capable of modifying the burn rate of 
propellants without resorting to lead as a burn rate additive. 

Accordingly, the use of from about 0.5% to about 5.0% Group IIA 
metal salt is taught as effective burn rate modifiers in 

propellants, in order provide non-toxic means for modifying the 
propellant burn rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to methods and compositions 
for modifying the burn rate of solid rocket motor propellants, 
without the addition of expensive, toxic or polluting materials, 
such as lead or copper. More particularly, the present invention 
is related to the use of Group IIA metal ions, added in the form of 
Group IIA salts or similar materials, to modify the burn rate of 
solid rocket motor propellants. In the manufacture of solid rocket motors, several components 
have been found to be required. First there must be an adequate 
rocket motor case. The rocket motor case forms the exterior of the 
rocket motor and provides the essential structural integrity for 
the rocket motor. The rocket motor case is conventionally 
manufactured from a rigid, yet durable, material such as steel or 
filament wound composite.  Placed within the interior of the rocket motor case is the 
propellant grain. The propellant forming the grain is 
conventionally burned to form thrust within the interior of the 
rocket motor case. The formation of hot gases upon burning of the 
propellant, and the subsequent exit of those gases through the 
throat and nozzle of the case provide the thrust to propel the 
rocket motor. There are two major classes of propellants used in 
conventional applications. These include solid propellants and 
liquid propellants. Solid propellants are used extensively in the 
aerospace industry. Solid propellants have developed as the 
preferred method of powering most missiles and rockets for 
military, commercial, and space applications. Solid rocket motor propellants have become widely accepted 
because of the fact that they are relatively simple to manufacture 
and use, and they have excellent performance characteristics. 
Furthermore, solid propellant rocket motors are generally more 
simple than liquid fuel rocket motors. For all of these reasons, 
it is found that solid rocket propellants are very reliable and 
economical. In some applications, it is important that the rocket motor 
perform with reduced or eliminated smoke output. For example, in 
tactical rocket motors, the production of smoke causes a number of 
disadvantages. The smoke produced may obscure the vision of pilots 
or drivers of a craft or vehicle firing the tactical rocket. In  
 
addition, the production of smoke makes tracking the source of the 
motor easier, a serious disadvantage during military operations. An important consideration in solid propellants, including 
minimum smoke propellants, is means for
