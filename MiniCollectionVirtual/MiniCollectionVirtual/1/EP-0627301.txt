<ABSTRACT>
For producing a glass fibre-reinforced composite material, a glass fibre strand is drawn through a moving aqueous powder dispersion of a coupling agent by means of deflecting elements, the water is removed, the powder is melted onto the glass fibre strand and the pretreated fibre strand is subsequently impregnated with polyolefins by means of melt pultrusion.

<CLAIMS>
A glass fiber-reinforced composite material comprising
a polyolefin and at least 40% by weight of glass

fibers and having a transverse flexural strength of
more than 40 MPa and an impact strength of more than

180 kJ m
-2
, wherein the glass fiber-reinforced composite
material additionally has a tensile strength of

more than 520 MPa and a longitudinal flexural
strength of more than 550 MPa.
A process for the preparation of a glass fiber-reinforced
composite material as claimed in claim 1,

the glass fiber strand being drawn through an
agitated aqueous powder dispersion of a coupling

agent over deflection bodies, and the dispersing
agent then being removed, the powder being melted

onto the glass fiber strand, and the pretreated
fiber strand subsequently being impregnated with

polyolefins in a melt pultrusion.
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein carboxylic
acid-modified polyolefins are used as the coupling

agent.
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
coupling agent is employed in a particle size of

less than 150 micrometers, preferably less than
30 micrometers.
The process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
solids content in the aqueous powder dispersion is

preferably 10 to 20 g/l.
