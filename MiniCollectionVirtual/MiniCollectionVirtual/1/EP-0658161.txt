<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain novel compounds, to a process for preparing
such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to
the use of such compounds and compositions in medicine.European Patent Applications, Publication Numbers 0,306,228 and 0419035
relate to certain thiazolidinedione derivatives disclosed as having hypoglycaemic and
hypolipidaemic activity.It is now surprisingly indicated that a specific group of compounds from
within formula (I) of EP-A-0,306,228 have improved selectivity of action and are
therefore of particular use in the treatment of Type II diabetes. These compounds are
also indicated to be of particular use for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of other
diseases including hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease,
especially atherosclerosis. In addition these compounds are considered to be useful
for treating certain eating disorders, in particular the regulation of appetite and food
intake in subjects suffering from disorders associated with under-eating, such as
anorexia nervosa, and disorders associated with over-eating, such as obesity and
anorexia bulimia.These compounds show good aqueous stability and good stability in the solid
form, certain of these compounds are indicated to be particularly stable. In addition
these compounds are significantly more soluble in water than the corresponding free
base.The surprising and advantageous stability and aqeous solubility of these
compounds provides for significant formulation and bulk handling advantages.Accordingly, the present invention provides 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione
maleic acid salt or an isomer or
tautomeric form thereof and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof.The compounds of the invention are salts. The present invention extends to all
forms of such salts including those provided by association of the salting hydrogen
with all possible salt forming parts of the molecule and especially that provided by
association with the pyridine nitrogen.As indicated above a compound of the invention may exist in one of several
tautomeric forms, all of which are encompassed by the present invention. It will be
appreciated that the present invention encompasses all of the isomeric forms of the
compounds of the invention, including any stereoisomeric forms thereof, whether as
individual isomers or as mixtures of isomers.Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include hydrates. In a further aspect the present invention also
