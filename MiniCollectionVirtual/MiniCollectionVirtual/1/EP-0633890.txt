<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a support carrying a homocyclic
or heterocyclic ring suitable for use in oligonucleotide
synthesis, its preparation and use, to a homocyclic or
heterocyclic compound which may be attached to a support and to
a support linked to an oligonucleotide through a group derived
from the compound.It is known to prepare oligonucleotides in a stepwise
manner on a solid support carrying a terminal nucleoside.
Typically a support is formed by attaching an organic spacer
group to a carrier, for example to controlled pore glass (CPG).
A known solid support is shown as Formula (A) below
Before the above support can be used in oligonucleotide
synthesis a nucleoside having a succinyl group is coupled to
the terminal -NH2 group, for example using 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCCI).The preparation and use of known solid supports in
oligonucleotide synthesis has been fully described in a book by
M.J. Gait entitled "Oligonucleotide Synthesis - A Practical
Approach", IRL Press, revised reprinting July 1985; and also In
the protocol to the Applied Biosystems DNA synthesiser Model
380B, particularly section 2 thereof which is incorporated
herein by reference thereto. Further descriptions of how solid
supports having a terminal nucleoside are made and used can be
found in US 4,458,066 and 4,725,677.For automated oligonucleotide synthesiser operatives 
coupling of a nucleoside having a succinyl group to a support
is considered inconvenient because this involves chemistry
which differs from that used in such synthesisers and requires
direct intervention by the operative, unlike the rest of the
synthesis which is fully automated. For this reason the
coupling is often not performed by the operative, instead
operatives purchase a ready made support coupled to a
nucleoside via a succinyl group.A limitation of such a ready made support coupled to a
nucleoside is that the nucleoside becomes part of the desired
oligonucleotide when the oligonucleotide is cleaved from the
support. Thus, for the synthesis of a given oligonucleotide
one must take care to choose a support having an appropriate
nucleoside attached to it which corresponds to the initial
nucleoside in the desired oligonucleotide. This also means
that an operative generally has to keep a number of different
derivatised supports to cater for each of the different
nucleosides found in DNA and RNA.There is a need for a versatile derivatised support which
is compatible with the chemistry used by synthesisers of
oligonucleotides, which is compatible with
