<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to oral care compositions 
which contain a betaine-type amphoteric surfactant. By the 

inclusion therein of saccharin or a saccharin alternative 
in conjunction with another sweetening agent such as 

thaumatin or stevioside, the bitter after-taste of the 
betaine-type amphoteric surfactant is significantly 

reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oral compositions which 
comprise a particular surfactant. More particularly, the present invention relates to oral 
compositions which comprise a certain class of amphoteric 
surfactants. Oral compositions in the context of the present invention 
are compositions for the care of the human teeth and mouth, 
and comprise compositions such as dentifrices, 
toothpastes, gels, mouthwashes, powders, tablets, lozenges, 
gargle solutions and the like. Oral care compositions frequently contain a surfactant, and 
the most common class of surfactants used in oral care 
compositions is the class of anionic surfactants. The most 
frequently used surfactant of this class is sodium 
laurylsulphate. This type of surfactants has, however, certain drawbacks, 
such as incompatibility with quaternary antibacterial 
compounds and biomolecules such as enzymes, bacteriophages, 
antibodies which may be present in the oral care 
compositions. Another type of surfactants which do not show the drawbacks 
of sodium laurylsulphate are the amphoteric surfactants. A 
typical representative of this class of surfactant are the 
betaine-type amphoteric surfactants. The betaine-type amphoteric surfactant can be represented 
by the following general formula:  in which R₁ is a C₈-₂₀ alkyl group or the group 
in which R₅ is a C₈-C₂₀ alkyl group and "a" ranges from 1-3, 
and in which R₂ and R₃ are each a C₁-C₃ alkyl group and 
R₄ is a C₁-C₄ alkalene group or a C₁-C₄ hydroxyalkylene 
group with one hydroxyl group. Such betaine-type amphoteric surfactants have already been 
proposed for use in oral care compositions. Thus, for 
instance, in US-A-4,490,353 and 4,528,182 these surfactants 
have been proposed for inclusion in oral care products 
which comprise a quaternary ammonium compound as anti-plaque 
agent, e.g. benzethonium chloride. However, we have found that brushing teeth with an oral 
care composition which contains a betaine-type surfactant 
of the above type caused a bitter-aftertaste in the mouth, 
as compared with similar compositions which contained 
sodium laurylsulphate. Since quaternary ammonium compound-type anti-plaque agents 
are generally perceived to have a bitter taste, it is 
believed that brushing the teeth with a composition 
containing a mixture of the betaine-type surfactant and a 
quaternary ammonium compound will cause an even more 
pronounced bitter-aftertaste in the mouth.  We also found, that the perceived bitter-aftertaste was 
more pronounced with oral care compositions that

<CLAIMS>
An oral care composition, substantially free from 
bitter-tasting quaternary ammonium compounds, 

containing a betaine-type amphoteric surfactant and 
saccharin or a saccharin alternative selected from the 

group consisting of cyclamate, aspartame, acesulfame K 
and chloro-sucrose, characterised in that it contains 

another sweetening agent selected from the group 
consisting of thaumatin, stevioside, glycyrrhizin, 

ammonium glycyrrhizinate and neohesperidin 
dihydrochalcone. 
A composition according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the sweetening agent is thaumatin or stevioside. 
A composition according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the saccharin alternative is aspartame or 

acesulfame K. 
A composition according to claim 1-3, characterised in 
that the amphoteric surfactant is cocamidopropylbetaine.
