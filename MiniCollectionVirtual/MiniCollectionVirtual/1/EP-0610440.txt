<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical fiber technology and, more particularly to, optical
isolators useful in blocking reflections of optical signals generated by a laser through an optical
fiber.In present day optical fiber technology, semiconductor lasers are typically used to
generate and relay light signals on optical fibers. These lasers are particularly susceptible to
light signal reflections, which cause a laser to become unstable and noisy. Optical isolators are
used to block these reflected signals from reaching the laser. Ideally, these optical isolators
transmit all of the light signals in the forward direction and block all of the signals in the
reverse direction.Of course, optical isolators do not attain ideal performance levels and improvements are
constantly sought for. Furthermore, optical fiber technology have an inherent large bandwidth
which has encouraged the spread of optical fiber networks. However, one factor which has
slowed the use of optical fiber technology has been costs, including those for optical isolators.
With an optical isolator generally required for each laser generating signals on an optical fiber,
it is highly desirable that the cost of the optical isolators be lowered as much as possible.The present invention solves or substantially mitigates these problems by offering an
optical isolator having higher performance with lower costs. EP-A-0 349 309 describes a birefringence diffraction type polarizer for use, for example,
in an optical isolator. In one example the polarizer consists of a device comprising a crystal substrate of lithium
niobate having optical anisotropy. A series of proton exchanged regions are provided
periodically on the substrate, thereby providing an optical diffraction grating. These
regions are covered with dielectric layers, and further diffused in the vicinity of the
surface thereof with metal. Such an arrangement prevents distortion of the crystal lattice
and avoids linearly polarised incident light from become elliptically polarised.In accordance with one aspect of the invention there is provided an optical isolator
comprising at least one polarizing element wherein the polarizing element is
a birefringent crystal wedge comprising lithium niobate.In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided an
optical isolator for optical fibers and comprising in succession a first sleeve for holding a
first optical fiber, a first GRIN lens a first polarizing element, an optical Faraday rotator
(13), a second polarizing
