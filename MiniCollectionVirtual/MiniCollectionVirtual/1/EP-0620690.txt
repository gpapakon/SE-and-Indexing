<ABSTRACT>
The invention is intended to integrate the means for scrambling 
(ciphering) the television signal and the means for descrambling the 

scrambled signal to reproduce the original signal, possessing a memory for 
storing the key data, in which. when scrambling is instructed by the 

operation switch, the output of the memory is given to the read address 
counter through the address generating circuit from the MSB inverting 

circuit, and scrambling is effected by executing line rotation from the cut 
point differing in every 1H. When descrambling, reverse processing is 

effected to decipher. Since circuit blocks for scrambling and descrambling 
are common, by integrating them, the apparatus is reduced in size, and 

presented at a lower price.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video signal encrypting apparatus
capable of processing signals to make information signals secret in the case
of storage, satellite communication, wireless communication, wired communication
or the like of the data recorded by video camera, video tape recorder.
optical disk or the like without being known to the others.Recently, as a result of advancement of various communication media such
as communication satellite and recording media such as optical disk, data communication
and information transmission in a very wide area and at high speed
are realized. On the other hand. by information transmission by data communications,
many people have an easy access and it is difficult to keep
secrecy of the information to be transmitted.For example, in-house communication using communication satellite, data
communication including enterprise secret information by television conference,
and in-house experiment data are often transmitted by recording in information 
recording media such as video tape recorder (VTR) and optical disk.Such information, picture and sound are usually confidential. To make
such information secret, a scramble encoder having a scrambling function is
used. A conventional scrambling encoder, however, requires a huge encrypting
system and encoder, and encrypting process was not easy. Hence, the apparatus
for easily recording and reproducing secret information in VTR or the like
was huge in size and expensive, which was the bottleneck for transmission of
secret information.Fig. 11 is a block diagram showing a schematic constitution of a
conventional scrambling encoder. In the diagram, numeral 101 is a computer
for controlling the entire scrambling encoder (hereinafter referred to as CPU).
and various types are used depending on the system size, ranging from a
personal computer to a general-purpose computer. Video signals and audio
signals are applied to a video scrambler 102 and an audio scrambler 103,
respectively. In synchronism with the video signal, a key signal is formed
by a key signal forming circuit 104, and is superposed in a superposing
circuit 105 with the video signal scrambled by the video scrambler 102. The
audio signal is frequency-modulated in an FM circuit 106, and mixed with the
output of the superposing circuit 105 in a mixing circuit 107, thereby
obtaining a scrambled composite video signal. The operation of such scrambling encoder is described below. Various
methods are considered for the video scrambler 102, and this is to describe
the
