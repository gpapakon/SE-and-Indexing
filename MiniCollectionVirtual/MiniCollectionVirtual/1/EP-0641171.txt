<ABSTRACT>
A process for reproducing a design, especially a fabric design comprising an embroidered appliqué element stitched to a base fabric material, comprises the sequential steps of analysing the design to derive data for use as stitch command data by an embroidery machine (10), and as cutting command data by a cutting machine (8), cutting out an appliqué element (18) from a sheet material (26) in accordance with the cutting command data, transferring the cut-out appliqué element (18) to a base material and stitching the appliqué element (18) to the base material in accordance with the stitch command data. The invention provides a far quicker, more accurate and neater embroidered appliqué fabric than prior semi-manual techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the control of cutting and 
embroidery machines and particularly to the control of such 
machines for reproducing designs incorporating appliqué 
elements. Computer control of embroidery machines is well known. 
Control may be either direct or via a program stored on a 
punched tape, as described in patent document EP-B-0221163 
for example. Such computer controlled embroidery machines 
have been used for generating designs incorporating appliqué 
elements, for example in which shaped elements of one sheet 
material (the appliqué elements) are attached to a base of 
the same or a different sheet material by stitching in the 
embroidery machine. The sequence of steps in generating prior art appliqué 
designs has been as follows. First a representation of the 
desired design is entered into the computer by means of a 
design program or a video input or by other well-known 
methods. The computer, under the direction of an operator, 
uses the representation of the design to derive stitch 
command data for the embroidery machine. The operator may in 
certain cases manipulate the design, for example by rotation 
or enlargement, before the stitch command data are generated. 
A sufficiently large sheet of the appliqué material is placed 
over the base material in the embroidery machine and, in 
response to the stitch command data from the computer, the 
embroidery machine stitches through both layers an outline of 
the desired shape of the appliqué element. A human operator 
then trims the appliqué material around this outline and, 
once trimming is complete, further stitching may be carried 
out under computer control, for example to hide the edges of  
 
the appliqué element or to add further detail. The labour-intensive nature of the manual trimming operation 
described above is clear. The more complex the outline of 
the appliqué element, the more difficult is the trimming 
operation and where the outline is not a simple closed curve, 
for example with a ring-shaped appliqué element, the above 
procedure may not be practical at all. Furthermore, it is 
very wasteful of material to begin each appliqué operation 
with a plain sheet of appliqué material, much of which must 
subsequently be trimmed away. The invention provides a process for reproducing a design, 
comprising the steps of analysing the design to derive data 
for use as stitch command data by an embroidery machine and 
as cutting command data by a cutting machine, cutting out an 
appliqué element from a sheet material in

<CLAIMS>
A process for reproducing a design, comprising the 
steps of analysing the design to derive data for use as 

stitch command data by an embroidery machine (10), and as 
cutting command data by a cutting machine (8), cutting 

out an appliqué element (18) from a sheet material (26) 
in accordance with the cutting command data, transferring 

the cut-out appliqué element (18) to a base material (16) 
and stitching the appliqué element (18) to the base 

material (16) in accordance with the stitch command data. 
A process according to claim 1, including the 
further step of stitching a mark out pattern (14) on the 

base material (16) in accordance with the stitch command 
data, before the steps of transferring the cut-out 

appliqué element (18) to the base material and stitching 
the appliqué element to the base material. 
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
including the further step of applying additional 

decorative stitching to the appliqué element (18), after it 
has been stitched to the base material (16), also in 

accordance with the stitch command data. 
A process according to any preceding claim, 
including the further steps of analysing the design to 

derive data for use as sign painting data by a 
numerically controlled painting machine, and painting a 

design on the sheet material (26) either before or after the 
cutting operation on the cutting machine (8), but before 

transferring the cut-out appliqué element (18) to the base 
material (16). 
A process according to claim 4, wherein the 
painting machine is a numerically controlled air brush 

painting machine.  
 
A process according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the rear surface of the cut-out appliqué element (18) 

is pre-coated with an adhesive in order to assist initial 
location of the cut-out appliqué element on the base 

material (16) after its transfer to the base material. 
A process according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the cutting machine (8) is a laser cutter. 
A process according to claim 7, wherein the sheet 
(26) from which the appliqué element (18) is cut is 

adhesively mounted on a backing layer from which the 
appliqué element (18) can easily be peeled, and the 

laser cutter (8) is focussed so as to cut through both 
the appliqué element (18) and the backing layer, so that 

after cutting the appliqué element (18) can be removed 
from its sheet with its own individual backing layer 

intact, for transfer to the base material (16). 
A process according to claim 7 or claim 8, 
wherein the laser cutter (8) is programmed to cut partially 

through the upper surface of the appliqué element (18) to 
obtain a surface etched or contoured effect, in addition 

to the cutting of the outline of the appliqué element.
