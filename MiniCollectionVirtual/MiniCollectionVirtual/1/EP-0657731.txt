<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and a device for evaluating the characteristic absorption of one or more materials in a material mixture, radiation pulses, alternately with at least one wavelength characteristic of a material to be measured and one wavelength not characteristic thereof, propagating through a measuring path (5) on which the material mixture is located, a reference path (6) without material mixture and at least one calibration path (7; 8), and subsequently being converted into electrical signals. In this case, before the actual formation of measured values, each individual pulse of the electrical signal (12; 22) is evaluated for interference and if necessary corrected. By taking the difference between the signal from the measurement section (13; 14) and the reference-path signal (23; 24), the influence of the radiation source and all other interference sources in the measurement system itself on the measured value is minimised. This difference signal is subsequently selected in the frequency domain and/or in the time domain, evaluated once more and optionally corrected before it is output as measured value. The reference-path signal (22) and at least one calibration-path signal (32; 42) are furthermore fed to a radiation-source stabilisation system.

in a mixture of substances, whereby radiation pulses, in particular laser pulses,

alternately with at least one wavelength which is characteristic for a substance
to be measured and one wavelength which is uncharacteristic for said

substance, pass through a measuring path (5), on which the substance mixture
is located, and a reference path (6) without the substance mixture and without

a calibration trough, and are then converted into electrical signals (12, 22, 13,
23, 14, 24),

a differential signal (160; 260) is formed from the measuring path
signal (13; 14) and the reference path signal (23; 24); and
