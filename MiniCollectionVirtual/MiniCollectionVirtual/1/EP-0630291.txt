<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to an abrasion-resistant carrier catalyst for removing the nitrite and/or nitrate content of polluted water with selective nitrogen formation. The catalytically active metal component is palladium and/or rhodium or palladium and a metal from the copper group. The carrier consists of aluminium oxide in the ''theta'' and ''kappa'' modification and has either one maximum pore diameter in the 700 to 1500  ANGSTROM  range or two maxima in the 100 to 1500  ANGSTROM  range. The description also relates to a continuously operable process for the removal or reduction of the oxygen, nitrate and/or nitrate content of water by catalytic hydration. The process is implemented using the novel carrier catalysts, the carriers being made of aluminium oxide of the theta and kappa modifications. The contamination of the catalyst is effectively prevented by the preferred use according to the fluidised bed process.
