<ABSTRACT>
A tag is added to an asphalt additive, typically an anti-stripping 
agent. The additive dye is mixed with other components 

of an asphalt composition and melt processed at 300째F (149째C) or 
above to produce an asphalt composition. Presence of the tag to 

identify presence of the additive is performed by dissolving the 
asphalt portion of the composition in a water-immiscible solvent 

and then extracting the tag in an acidic aqueous solution and 
developing a color with a diazo compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to tagging asphalt
additives, particularly anti-stripping agents, but also lime and
fillers.Asphalt compositions, such as asphalt concrete used for
paving roadways or asphalt roofing compositions, comprise an
asphalt cement and aggregate. The aggregate is typically natural
or synthetic sand and gravel of various sieve sizes or specified
meshes. The asphalt may be of a variety of grades, for example,
harder grades of asphalt will be used for pavement applications
in warmer climates while softer grades of asphalt will be used
for pavement applications in colder climates. The asphalt may be
modified by inclusion of polymeric materials, such as rubber or
latex. Likewise, the mesh distribution and type of aggregate may
vary widely, depending upon the application. In asphalt concrete
used for paving, the aggregate is by far the major portion,
typically comprising about 95 weight percent with the asphalt
portion typically comprising the remaining 5 weight percent.As described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,775,419, 4,430,127,
4,639,273, 4,743,304 and 5,037,474, 
a major limitation to
durability of asphalt compositions is the strength of the bond
between the asphalt portion and the aggregate, a bond which is
weakened by water, either water initially present in the
aggregate or water to which the asphalt composition is
subsequently exposed. Accordingly, as taught by the above-referenced
patents, an anti-stripping agent is incorporated into
the asphalt portion. The anti-stripping agent is typically an
organic polyamine, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,430,127, but may be a
variety of other compounds or mixtures of compounds. U.S. Patent
No. 4,775,419 teaches the use of metal amine complexes. U.S.
Patent No. 4,430,127 teaches epoxylated polyamines. U.S. Patent
4,639,273 teaches formaldehyde adducts of amines, polyamines and
amides. U.S. Patent No. 4,743,304 teaches the use of
imadazolines, polyamines, alkoxylated polyamines, aminocarboxylic
esters, amide-amines and mixtures thereof. U.S.
Patent No. 5,037,474 teaches using the reaction product of an
epoxy compound with either phosphoric acid or a partial ester of
phosphoric acid. Other materials, such as lime added to the
aggregate, or fillers, such as cellulose or portland cement, may
also be added to increase the strength and durability of the
asphalt composition.The lifetime of an asphalt composition is heavily dependent
upon the additives added, particularly anti-stripping agent, but
also lime and fillers. Accordingly, contracts, such as

<CLAIMS>
A method of determining the presence of an
additive in an asphalt composition, comprising the steps of


tagging said additive with a tag selected from
compounds of the general formulae:

 alkyl group,
mixing said tagged additive with asphalt and other
components of an asphalt composition to form a mixture, an

asphalt portion of said mixture comprising said asphalt and
any asphalt-soluble component, including said tag,
processing said mixture at temperatures of 300째F
(149째C) or above to form the asphalt composition,
obtaining a specimen of said asphalt composition,
dissolving the asphalt portion of said specimen in
a water-immiscible solvent to form an asphalt portion-in-solvent

solution, and
concurrently or successively extracting the tag
from said asphalt portion-in-solvent solution and

developing a colour by reacting said tag with a diazo
compound.

additive is an anti-stripping agent.
A method according to claim 2 wherein said
anti-stripping agent comprises polyamines.
A method according to claim 1 wherein said
additive is lime.
A method according to claim 1 wherein said
additive is a filler.
A method according to claim 5 wherein said
filler is Portland cement.
