<CLAIMS>
A flame-resistant polyurethane which comprises, as
the flameproofing agent, a mixture of oligomeric

phosphoric acid esters which carry hydroxyalkoxy
groups, of the formula I



in which 
q
 denotes an average chain length of 0.5 to
10, R
1
 is a hydroxyl-containing radical of the
formula II a, R
2
 is a radical of the formula III


R
3
 is a radical of the formula II b, R
4
 is R
1
 or R
3
;
R
5
, R
6
 and R
7
 are an H atom or an alkyl radical
having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, m is 0 to 4 and n is 1

to 4.
A flame-resistant polyurethane as claimed in claim
1, wherein the flameproofing agent of the formula I

is obtained by reacting one or more ortho-phosphoric
acid esters of the formula IV 



with phosphorus pentoxide in a first stage in a
manner which is known per se in a molar ratio of

(2.1 to 3.5) : 1.0 at a temperature of 20 to 180°C
in the course of 0.5 to 72 hours, in the resulting

polyphosphoric acid ester mixture of the formula V


in which 
p
 denotes an average chain length of 4 to
60, partly hydrolyzing or glycolyzing the P-O-P

bonds selectively in a second stage by addition of
water or a glycol of the formula VI



in which R
5
, R
6
 and n have the abovementioned meaning,
at a temperature of 20 to 100°C, and reacting

the resulting mixture of polyphosphoric acid partial
esters of the formula VII 



in which R
2
 has the abovementioned meaning or is
zero, 
q
 denotes a reduced average chain length of
only 0.5 to 10 and R
8
 has the meaning of R
3
 or is an
H atom, with an epoxide of the formula VIII in a

third stage at a temperature of 20 to 180°C.

A flame-resistant polyurethane as claimed in claim
1 or 2, wherein the flameproofing agent mixture of

the formula I has a phosphorus content of 15 to 20
% by weight and a hydroxyl number of 30 to 300 mg of

KOH/g.
A flame-resistant polyurethane as claimed in any one
of claims 1 to 3, which comprises 3 to 50 parts by

weight of flameproofing agent mixture of the formula
I per 100 parts by weight of the polyol usually

employed for the preparation of the polyurethane.
