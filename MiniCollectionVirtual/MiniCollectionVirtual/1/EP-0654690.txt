<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an active-type 
automatic focusing apparatus, and more particularly to an 

automatic focusing apparatus of a type having an 
arrangement that a light receiving portion (34,35) is disposed on 

each side of a light emitting unit (33) to obtain the distance 
from a subject in accordance with the output from each 

light receiving portion. An automatic focusing apparatus 
of the foregoing type according to the present invention 

is enabled to have a small size by shortening the distance (L2) 
from either of the light receiving portions disposed on 

the two sides of the light emitting unit to the light 
emitting unit than the distance (L2) from the other light 

receiving portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an active-type
automatic focusing apparatus that irradiates, with light,
a subject, the range from which is intended to be found,
that is, a subject of range finding, and receives light
reflected from the subject to calculate information of the
found range.Hitherto, a so-called active-type automatic focusing
apparatus has been known which emits light from a light
emitting device, such as an IRED, to a subject and which
receives light reflected from the subject by a
semiconductor position sensing device (PSD) or the like to
measure the distance from the position, at which light has
been received, to the subject by a principle of
triangulation. Referring to Fig. 5, an active-type automatic
focusing apparatus of the foregoing conventional type will
now be described.Referring to Fig. 5 (a), reference numeral 10
represents a light emission side lens, 11 represents a
light receiving side lens, 12 represents an IRED (Infrared
Ray Emitting Diode), 13 represents a semiconductor
position sensing device (a PSD), and 14 represents a
subject.Light emitted from the IRED 12 is allowed to pass
through the light emission side lens 10 and the subject 14
is irradiated with light. Light reflected by the subject
14 is allowed to pass through the light receiving side
lens 11 before it is made incident upon the PSD 13. The
position at which light is made incident upon the PSD 13
is shifted depending on the change in the distance from
the subject 14, thus causing electric currents IA and IB
transmitted from pair of the two ends of the PSD 13 to be
changed.Thus, an apparatus of the foregoing type is arranged
in such a manner that the electric currents IA and IB are
electrically amplified to calculate the distance to the
subject.A problem of the contrast of the subject will now be
described. If the subject 14 has no contrast, the center of a
spot 15 of light reflected by the subject 14 is brought to
a central position of the spot 15, a distance x1 from an
end of the PSD 13, as shown in Fig. 5 (b). Thus, the
level of each of the output electric currents IA and IB at
the two ends of the PSD 13 corresponds to the position x1.Assuming that the contrast, and thus the reflectance
of the right half portion of the subject 14 is low, the
light spot 15 on the PSD 13 has a contrast as shown, for
example, in Fig. 5 (c). That is, the position of the
center of the light spot 15 on the PSD 13 is shifted to
right by a distance a. As a result, the position of the
center of light is made to be (x1 + a), thus
