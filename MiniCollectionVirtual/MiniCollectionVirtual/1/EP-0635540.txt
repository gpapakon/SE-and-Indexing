<ABSTRACT>
A free-flowing solid comprising a 
tetrahydroabietyl phosphite is provided. The 

solid maintains its free-flowing character over 
extended periods of time. The solid is useful as 

a thermal oxidative stabilizer additive for 
thermoplastic compositions and because of its 

free-flowing character, may be easily used in 
conventional manufacturing processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 
tetrahydroabietyl phosphites and more 
particularly relates to free flowing solid 
particulates comprising tetrahydroabietyl 
phosphites. Thermoplastic compositions are known to 
exhibit degradation upon exposure to oxygen at 
elevated temperatures during molding processes 
and upon exposure to ultraviolet light when used 
in the sunlight. Various additives have been 
used in thermoplastic compositions to combat 
these problems, including hindered phenolic 
compounds as primary antioxidant, hindered amine 
compounds as light stabilizers and organic 
phosphite as secondary antioxidant. One such 
class of organic phosphites is the 
tetrahydroabietyl phosphite which is set out in 
Enlow U.S. Patent 5,214,472 issued June 23, 1992, 
and U.S. Patent, Enlow 5,141,975 issued August 
25, 1992 and Enlow U.S. 5,142,083 issued August 
25, 1992, all of which are incorporated herein by 
reference. Such tetrahydroabietyl phosphites can 
exhibit poor handling properties. For example, 
tris (tetrahydroabietyl) phosphite when made into 
free-flowing powdered form loses its free-flowing 
character within two days at room temperature,  
 
and becomes largely coalesced within five days at 
room temperature, thereby making the phosphite 
inconvenient to use and handle as an additive for 
thermoplastic compositions. Consequently, there is a need for 
tetrahydroabietyl phosphites which when in 
particulate form will retain their free-flowing 
character for extended periods of time. The present invention provides 
tetrahydroabietyl phosphites in free-flowing 
solid particulates which retain their free-flowing 
character over an extended period of time 
at room temperature. The particulates are formed 
from an admixture of a tetrahydroabietyl 
phosphite and a material selected from the group 
consisting of hindered phenolic compounds, 
hindered amine compounds, organic phosphite 
compounds and mixtures thereof, wherein the 
material has a melting temperature of greater 
than 40째C. The particulate may be formed and 
then stored and then blended with a thermoplastic 
resin to provide a stabilized thermoplastic 
composition. The free-flowing solid compositions of the 
present invention comprise organic phosphite 
particulates which are preferably present in the 
composition at a level of 10 to 100 percent by 
weight of the compositions, more preferably at a 
level of from 50 to 100 percent by weight of the 
compositions, and most preferably a level of from 
95 to 100 percent by weight of the
