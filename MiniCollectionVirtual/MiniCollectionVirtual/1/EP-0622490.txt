<ABSTRACT>
A process for treating wastepaper to remove oily waste and inorganic 
components, which comprises: (a) forming an organoclay treating 

composition in a wastepaper aqueous system; (b) contacting the wastepaper 
aqueous system with an amount of the organoclay effective to remove from 

the wastepaper oily waste and inorganic components; and (c) recovering

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described herein relates to a process of removing clay and
filler, and other inorganic components which upon ignition constitute ash, as
well as oily wastes, from a pulp of wastepaper in an aqueous system that then
may be utilized to make new paper products. The invention is particularly
directed to a process of collecting such inorganic components and oily waste
by means of a novel treatment agent which is an organoclay.This invention relates to research which is described in US-A-5,151,155.Wastepaper has in the past been sporadically utilized as a source of
material for new paper mostly of low grade and quality. In light of growing
environmental concerns, including an expanding body of statutory law and
regulation, paper makers are under current pressure to increase the
utilization of recycling of wastepaper for all types of new paper. In
addition the quality of such paper has become increasingly important
particularly for high grade paper and paper board products. While many researchers have focused their concern on the removal of ink
from previously used paper as part of the recycling process, another major
concern is removal of the many other chemicals contained in paper. Coating
clays and filler clays are two of the most common ingredients used in many
high grade papers.Non-cellulose coatings, filler clay and other products are added during
paper manufacture or deposited on paper surfaces during processing or applied
to paper in converting or printing operations to enhance a number of
different appearance characteristics. These characteristics include
smoothness, printability, gloss, durability and paper protection. The range
of formulation of the various materials varies greatly depending on the
intended function of the paper, resulting in a variety of what then become
contaminants in conventional wastepaper recycling processes. These can range
from simple filler clay particles to tenacious chemicals and pigments. The
amount of this material can vary from 1% to as high as 50% of the overall
weight of the wastepaper.Even within a given type category of wastepaper there can be a
significant variation in the type and amount of clays and other materials.
These non-ink components, after ignition of the paper, are commonly referred
to as ash content. For example, in some types of newsprint, ash content is
less than 1%, and there is no intentional addition of clays to enhance
desired properties. In some paper types a small amount of talc may be used
in production to help control pitch
