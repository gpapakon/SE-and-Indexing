<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions in a form
of a self-emulsifying formulation containing a basic amine which provide high
concentration and high oral bioavailability for pyranone compounds which are
inhibitors of retroviral protease.It has recently been discovered that certain pyranone compounds inhibit
retroviral protease and thus they are useful for treating patients infected with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which results in acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). In particular, the pyranone compound of formula I has been
found to be especially effective as an inhibitor of retroviral protease.
However, like many other HIV protease inhibitors, these compounds are
characteristically lipophilic and thus poorly water soluble. For example, the
compound of formula I has an aqueous solubility about 1 Âµg/ml in the buffer of pH
6.5 (close to the pH of the intestine), which is considered to have extremely poor
aqueous solubility and would be expected to provide very low oral bioavailability in
the free acid form. It is well known that an active drug substance or therapeutic
moiety administered by any route must possess some aqueous solubility for systemic
absorption and therapeutic response. Poorly water soluble compounds often exhibit
either incomplete or erratic absorption and thus produce a minimal response at
desired dosage.Attempts were made to identify salts of the pyranone compounds in solid
forms which could improve aqueous solubility. An overriding defect which has 
however remained is that the formulation in the form of salt are prone to
precipitation of the parent free acid in the gastrointestinal tract and hence are not
capable to provide a dosage in the desired high concentration to permit convenient
use and yet meet the required criteria in terms of bioavailability.Recognizing the problems, the present invention is directed toward
pharmaceutical compositions in a form of self-emulsifying formulations which
provide high concentration and high oral bioavailability for pyranone compounds. In
particular it has been discovered that the compositions of the present invention
allow the preparation of self-emulsifying formulations containing a pyranone
inhibitor of retroviral protease in an exceedingly high concentration up to about 500
mg/g to permit convenient oral administration while at the same time achieving
improved bioavailability, which is at least three fold higher than the aqueous
suspension of the free acid.The International Publication No. WO 95/30670
