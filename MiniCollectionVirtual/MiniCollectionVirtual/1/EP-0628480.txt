<ABSTRACT>
A packaging machine comprising a container conveyor (12) 
mounted on a bed (11), and a group of devices mounted on 

the bed (11) and 
successively arranged along the path of transport of the conveyor, 

the 
group of devices including at least a filling device (15) and a sealing 

device (17). 
The bed (11) comprises a pair of side frames (24) extending in 

parallel to the 
direction of transport of the conveyor, and a plurality of 

holders (31-37) 
connected between the frames and corresponding in number to the 

number 
of the devices, the holders respectively having the devices attached 

thereto. At least one of the holders (34), is movable longitudinally 
of the 

side frames (24), and is releasably fixed at a desired position along 
the length 

of the side frames (24) by fixing means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to packaging machines, for 
example, to a packaging machine for filling dessert into cuplike containers 
and thereafter closing the opening of each container with a strip of 
closure material. Packaging machines of the type mentioned are already known which 
comprise a container conveyor mounted on a bed, and a group of devices 
mounted on the bed and successively arranged along the path of transport of 
the conveyor, the group of devices including at least a container feeder, 
filling device, sealing device and container discharging device. The bed 
comprises a pair of opposite side frames extending in parallel to the 
direction of transport of the conveyor, and a plurality of holders 
connected between the frames and corresponding in number to the number of 
devices. The holders respectively have the devices attached thereto and are 
secured to the side frames by welding. When it is attempted to change the position of some of the 
devices of the above packaging machine to alter the layout of the group of 
devices, difficulty is encountered in changing the position of devices, for 
example, because there arises a need to prepare a new bed. The main object of the present invention is to provide a 
packaging machine which readily permits alteration of the layout of 
component devices. The present invention provides a packaging machine which 
comprises a container conveyor mounted on a bed, and a group of devices 
mounted on the bed and successively arranged along the path of transport of 
the conveyor, the group of devices including at least a filling device and 
a sealing device, the bed comprising a pair of side frames extending in  
 
parallel to the direction fo transport of the conveyor, and a plurality of 
holders connected between the frames and corresponding in number to the 
number of the devices, the holders respectively having the devices attached 
thereto, whereby at least one of the holders is movable longitudinally of 
the side frames and has fixing means for releasably fixing the movable 
holder at a desired position along the length of the side frames, as known 
from FR-A-1,330,730. With the packaging machine of the present invention each of the 
side frames is supported by a plurality of support legs, and at least one 
of the support legs at each of opposite sides is movable longitudinally of 
the side frame and has fixing means for releasably fixing the movable 
support leg at a desired position along the length of the side frame. Thus, 
the position of the

<CLAIMS>
A packaging machine comprising a container conveyor (12) mounted 
on a bed (11), and a group of devices mounted on the bed (11) and 

successively arranged along the path of transport of the conveyor, the 
group of devices including at least a filling device (15) and a sealing 

device (17), the bed (11) comprising a pair of side frames (24; 88) extending 
in parallel to the direction of transport of the conveyor, and a plurality 

of holders (31-37) connected between the frames (24) and corresponding in 
number to the number of the devices, the holders respectively having the 

devices attached thereto, the packaging machine being characterised in that 
at least one of the holders (34) is movable longitudinally of the side 

frames (24) and has fixing means (61, 63) for releasably fixing the movable holder 
(34) at a desired position along the length of the side frames (24), and 

in that each of the side frames (24) is supported by a 
plurality of support legs (26, 27, 28) and at least one of the support legs 

(28), at each of opposite sides is movable longitudinally of the side frame 
(24) and has fixing means (53) for releasable fixing the movable support leg 

(28) at a desired position along the length of the side frame (24). 
A packaging machine as defined in claim 1 which comprises 
different kinds of side frames (88) having different lengths. 
A packaging machine as defined in claim 1 or 2, wherein each of 
the side frames (24) comprises upper and lower guide rails (51, 52) and the 

movable support leg (28) has an upper portion extending across and 
connected to the upper and lower guide rails (51, 52) at the corresponding 

side, the fixing means comprising a plurality of clamp members (53) holding 
the upper and lower guide rails (51, 52) between the clamp member and the 

support leg (28) at the corresponding side, and a plurality of fastening 
bolts (56) extending through each of the clamp members (53) and screwed
