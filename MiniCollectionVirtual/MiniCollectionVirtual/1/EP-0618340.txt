<ABSTRACT>
A drive device for a slatted blind (1), in particular for roof windows, is composed of a motor-driven upper driveshaft (12) which is connected, via a lifting mechanism, to a lifting rod (4) which is arranged beneath the slats (2) and of which the ends are guided in rails (7) fastened on the window frame (6), cord-like carrying ladders (3) which receive the slats (2) being fitted on a turning device which is assigned to the driveshaft (12). In order to guide the lifting rod (4) reliably, even in the case of a flat roof inclination, to a horizontal arrangement, and to prevent sticking, the driveshaft is provided at both ends with a gearwheel (13) which is connected to a drive belt (8) which is deflected at the lower end of the relevant guide rail (7) and on which the lifting rod (4) is fastened. Moreover, the drive device can also be used, with slight modifications, for roller blinds or folding curtains. For roller blinds, the gearwheels are fastened fixedly on the shaft and/or hollow shaft and a torsion spring is arranged between the shaft and the tube shaft and a roller blind which can be wound up and unwound is fastened on the tube shaft. For folding curtains, the gearwheels are fastened fixedly on the shaft and/or hollow shaft and a folding curtain which is connected to the lifting rod is fastened on the tube shaft.

A slatted blind, particularly for roof windows, having 
slats (2) which are suspended in loop-like supports 

(3), have a slope adjustable by a tilter, are guided at 
their end in lateral rails (7), and are gripped underneath 

by a lifting rod (4) which can be raised an lowered, 
the lifting mechanism comprising a drive shaft 

(12) rotatable in both direction and provided at each 
end with a gearwheel (13) which engages a driving belt 

(8) disposed between guide pulleys (9, 10) an secured 
to a respective end of the lifting rod, characterised 

in that 

(a) a tubular shaft (5) is rotatably mounted on the end 
(31, 38) of the drive shaft (26, 27) between the 

gearwheels (13) and is secured to the supports (3) 
of the slats (2), the rotation of which is limited 

to about 180° by an abutment (41) secured to the 
window frame (6) and which are connected to the 

drive shaft (26) by a slipping clutch (40), 
(b) the gearwheels are mounted on the ends (31, 38) of 
the guide shaft (26, 27) so as to be movable in rotation 

through an angle of about 180° between two 
abutments (32, 33), and 
(c) a cylindrical motor and gear unit (20) is disposed 
inside the tubular shaft (5) and is connected by a 

clutch (25) on the one hand to one gearwheel (13) 
via a central shaft (26) and on the other hand to 

the other gearwheel (13) via a hollow shaft (27) 
which surround the motor and gear unit (20). 
A slatted blind according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a disc-shaped driver (34) is secured to the outer 

end of the central shaft (26) or hollow shaft (27) and 
has an arcuate cut-out (35) constituting the abutments 

(32, 33) and engaging a driver pin (36) on the gearwheel 
(23). 
A slatted blind according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the abutment (41) comprises an annular 

member (43) secured to the tubular shaft (5) and having 
an abutment pin (42) and also comprises a component 

(45) secured to the window frame (6) and formed with an 
arcuate groove (44) in which the abutment pin (42) 

slides and the ends of which define the angle of rotation 
of about 180°. 
A slatted blind according to any of claim 1 or 3, characterised 
in that the slipping clutch (40) comprises 

two sleeve-like parts rotatable relatively to one another, 
the inner part being fixed to the central shaft 

(26) and the outer part to the tubular shaft (5). 
A slatted blind according to any of claim 1 or 4, characterised 
in that the driver (34) has an additional 

small cut-out (37) and for coupling without clearance 
can be fitted on the driver pin (36) of the gearwheel 

(13) by means of said cut-out (37).
