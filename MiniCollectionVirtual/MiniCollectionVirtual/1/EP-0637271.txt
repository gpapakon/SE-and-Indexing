Monitoring device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a connection (30) is provided between the 

output of the first sensor hose (4) and the input of the 
second sensor hose (12), and in that, for transmitting 

the indicator signal (c1) from the first sensor hose (4), 
and for transmitting the indicator signal (c2) from the 

second sensor hose (12), a common detector (34) is 
provided which is connected to the output of the second 

sensor hose (12).  
 
Monitoring device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that a dedicated pump and a dedicated detector 

are provided for the first sensor hose (4), and in that, 
likewise, a dedicated pump and a dedicated detector are 

provided for the second sensor hose (12). 
Monitoring device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that a subtraction element, preferably 

a computer, is provided as means (36) for the logical 
combination, according to location, of the two indicator 

signals (c1, c2). 
Monitoring device according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the first and the second sensor 

hose (4, 12) are laid two-dimensionally or spatially in 
serpentine fashion and parallel to each other. 
Monitoring device according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the section (4a) of the first 

sensor hose (4) and the section (12a) of the second 
sensor hose (12) can be flowed through by the transport 

medium (m) in the same direction. 
Monitoring device according to one of Claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the section (4a) of the first 

sensor hose (4) and the section (12a) of the second 
sensor hose (12) can be flowed through by the transport 

medium (m) in the opposite direction. 
Monitoring device according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the sealing film (2) is arranged 

horizontally, rising steeply or vertically and preferably 
comprises a synthetic material. 
Monitoring device according to one of Claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that the first and the second indicator 

signal (c1, c2) describe the concentration (c) of the 
material in the transport medium (m) as a function of the 

flow path length (s). 
Monitoring device according to one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterized in that at least the first or second 

sensor hose (4, 12) is incorporated in concrete (8, 16). 
Sealing film for a monitoring device of a rubbish 
dump, particularly for the monitoring device according to  

 
one of Claims 1 to 10, characterized in that means (60, 

62) are provided which hold the section (4a) of a first 
sensor hose (4) fitted on one side of the film parallel 

to the section (12a) of a second sensor hose (12) fitted 
on the other side of the film. 
Sealing film according to Claim 11, characterized 
in that the means (60, 62) for holding parallel are 

integrated into it or fastened to it, preferably bonded 
to it. 
Sealing film according to Claim 11 or 12, characterized 
in that the means (60, 62) for holding parallel 

comprise a clamping device for clamping the section of 
the first and/or second sensor hose (4, 12). 
Sealing film according to Claim 11, 12 or 13, 
characterized in that the first and the second sensor 

hose (4, 12) are laid on it in serpentine fashion. 
Sealing film according to one of Claims 11 to 14, 
characterized in that it is designed in a trough shape. 
Sealing film according to Claim 15, characterized 
in that the first and second sensor hose (4, 12) are 

arranged in the bottom region, in at least one wall (24) 
and/or in the upper edge region of the trough-shaped 

design and are preferably laid there in serpentine 
fashion. 
Process for localizing a leak in a sealing film 
which is provided for a rubbish dump, wherein a transport 

medium (m) is led at regular time intervals through a 
first sensor hose (4), which is laid on one side of the 

sealing film (2), and through a second sensor hose (12), 
which is laid parallel thereto on the other side of the 

sealing film (2), wherein the materials transported out, 
in so doing, from the first and the second sensor hose 

(4, 12) are measured by means of a first and second 
indicator signal (c1, c2), wherein the first indicator 

signal (c1) is logically combined, according to location, 
with the second indicator signal (c2), and wherein the 

logically combined signal (Δc) is displayed and/or evaluated. 
Process according to Claim 17, characterized in  
 

that the first and second indicator signal (c1, c2) are 
subtracted from each other according to location. 
Process according to Claim 17 or 18, characterized 
in that the location (s
o

sealing film (2) is detected from the logically combined 

signal (Δc) and displayed. 
Process according to one of Claims 17 to 19, 
characterized in that firstly the first and then the 

second indicator signal (c1, c2) are stored as a function 
of the time (t), in that then a location-dependent first 

and a location-dependent second indicator signal (c1(s), 
c2(s)) are calculated therefrom, in that the two location-dependent 

indicator signals (c1(s), c2(s)) are 
subtracted from each other, and in that an extreme value 

(48', 48'') in the subtraction signal (Δs) thus obtained 
is displayed according to location, this extreme value 

(48', 48'') being an indication of the presence and the 
local position (S
o
) of the leak (40).
