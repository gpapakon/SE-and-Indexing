<ABSTRACT>
A two-fluid method for fracturing a subterranean formation to increase the production of fluids from a well therein has been discovered. In a typical operation, a fluid pad is injected into the well which essentially simultaneously fractures the formation and forms a low permeability filter cake on at least part of the fracture. A proppant transport fluid containing proppant is then injected to prop open the fracture once the pressure is decreased. The filter cake is removed to permit production to begin. Although many conventional fluids may be used for the fluid pad, one preferred fluid pad uses graded calcium carbonate particle sizes and a modified lignosulfonate as a filter control agent. Optionally, a thixotropic polymer may be present as a viscosifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hydraulic fracturing
methods using fluid systems for controlling fluid losses
and hydraulic horsepower requirements, and more
particularly relates, in one aspect, to multi-fluid
methods which form a durable, thin filter cake to assist
in intentional screen-out during fracturing, but which is
easy to remove and results in little damage to the
permeability of the formation or the conductivity of the
propped fracture.Hydraulic fracturing is a method of using pump rate
and hydraulic pressure to fracture or crack a subterranean
formation. Once the crack or cracks are made, high
permeability proppant, relative to the formation
permeability, is pumped into the fracture to prop open the
crack. When the applied pump rates and pressures are
reduced or removed from the formation, the crack or
fracture cannot close or heal completely because the high
permeability proppant keeps the crack open. The propped
crack or fracture provides a high permeability path
connecting the producing wellbore to a larger formation
area to enhance the production of hydrocarbons.US-A-4109721 discloses a hydraulic fracturing process
for forming and propping a vertical fracture in a
subterranean formation using a sealant.WO-A-85/01309 discloses various non-damaging treating
fluids for use in completing a well after drilling.GB-A-1100110 discloses a method of increasing
production from fluid bearing underground formations by
appropriate deposition of propping agent in the fracture.US-A-3281354 discloses general improvements in the
art of fracturing oil and gas wells and to a well-working 
composition with low fluid loss.Hydraulic fracturing has been a successful method of
stimulating production from low-permeability hard rock
formations. These techniques have proven to be extremely
effective in improving hydrocarbon recovery rates making
otherwise unprofitable reservoirs an economic success.
Fracturing of soft formations requires a slightly
different approach, although the techniques are basically
the same. Soft formations, such as slightly consolidated
or non-consolidated sandstones, can be fractured and
filled with proppant. However, as the fracture closes,
the proppant becomes embedded or absorbed by the soft rock
matrix. To avoid this problem, the fracture in soft
formations should be as wide as possible. One effective
method for obtaining a wide fracture is tip screenout
(TSO) fracturing, described by M.B. Smith et al, "Tip
Screenout Fracturing: A Technique for Soft, Unstable
Formations," SPE Production
