<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce a pipe connection, two pipe ends (1,2) are provided on the end sides with socket portions (5,6) which, at their end, extend essentially up to the radial level of the outer sides of the non-widened regions of the pipe ends (1,2), provision being made for a supporting pipe (7) which bridges over the two socket portions (5,6) on the inside and, in terms of its internal radius, corresponds essentially to the internal radius of the non-widened regions of the pipe ends (1,2), the annular space between the supporting pipe and the socket portions (5,6) serving in each case for receiving sealing elements (8,9), and a screw-actuated bracing sleeve (10) which can be reduced in diameter engaging in a positively locking manner over the socket portions (5,6), on the outside, which bracing sleeve (10) exhibits a bead-like indent (12) on its axially central region and, moreover, is adapted to the outer contours of the two socket portions (5,6). By means of the bracing sleeve, the socket portions (5,6) are spaced apart on the end sides, a sufficient contact-pressure force being simultaneously exerted on the sealing elements (8,9). The fact that the socket portions (5,6) are comparatively short results in the push-in path for the supporting pipe (7), whose length, in the connection region, essentially completely bridges over the lengths of the two socket portions (5,6), being comparatively short.

Pipe coupling embracing two pipe ends (1,2) 
which are provided at their ends with socket sections 

(5,6) in which sealing elements (8,9) are set, wherein 
the socket sections (5,6) extend over a region of 

maximum enlargement to a region forming the pipe end 
face, wherein a single-shell or double-shell clamping 

sleeve (10) actuated by screwing and reducible in 
diameter is provided which is sized and shaped for 

shape-locking engagement over the socket sections (5,6) 
which lie axially opposed to each other, and wherein a 

support tube (7) is provided bridging the connecting 
region of the pipe ends (1,2), the internal radius of 

the support tube corresponding substantially to the 
internal radius of the unenlarged regions of the pipe 

ends (1,2), wherein the socket sections (5,6) extend at 
both ends substantially to the radial dimension of the 

outside of unenlarged regions of the pipe ends (1,2),
 
characterised in that 


the socket sections (5,6) receiving the sealing 
elements (8,9) extend out from the unenlarged 

regions of the pipe ends (1,2), 
the sealing elements (8,9) each take up the full 
space defined between the internal contour of the 

socket sections (5,6) on the one hand and the 
external contour of the support tube (7) on the 

other hand, 
the sealing elements (8,9) extend axially up to 
the end faces of the support tube (7), namely up 

to the unenlarged regions of the pipe ends (1,2), 
the clamping sleeve (10) has an indentation (12) 
in its axially central region, 
the internal contours of the clamping sleeve (10) 
are matched to the external contours of the socket 

sections (5,6), and  
 
the socket sections (5,6) which are in axially 
facing relationship are held axially spaced apart 

by means of the clamping sleeve (10). 
Pipe coupling according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that 


between the external contours of the socket 
sections (5,6) on the one hand and the internal 

contours of the clamping sleeve (10) on the other hand 
there is arranged an intermediate packing layer of 

rubber or other material, for example an elastomeric 
material.
