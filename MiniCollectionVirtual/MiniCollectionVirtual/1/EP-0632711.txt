<ABSTRACT>
A flexible leaflet heart valve (1) to replace natural aortic or pulmonary valves of the heart, includes a frame (3) and flexible leaflets (2) attached to the frame (3). Each flexible leaflet (2) forms part of a surface of revolution having its axis of revolution substantially orthogonal to the direction of blood flow through the valve (1). The valve (1) has improved opening characteristics under low flow conditions, and allows a large range of leaflet geometries for the same size valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to artificial heart 
valves, and more particularly to flexible leaflet heart 
valves 
as specified in the preamble of Claim 1 
which are used to replace the natural aortic or 
pulmonary valves of the heart.  
 Such valves are in general known from e.g. Medical And Biological 
Engineering, vol. 14, no. 2, p. 122-129, March 1976 or GB-A-1 443 221 
or CA-A-1 232 407. Conventionally, ball or disk valves are used to 
replace natural mitral or tricuspid aortic or pulmonary 
valves of the heart. These artificial valves comprise a 
rigid frame defining an aperture and a cage enclosing a 
ball or a disk. When blood flows in the desired direction, 
the ball or disk lifts away from the frame allowing the 
blood to flow through the aperture. The ball or disk is 
restrained by the cage by struts or by a pivot. When blood 
tries to flow in the reverse direction, the ball or disk 
becomes seated over the aperture and prevents the flow of 
blood through the valve. The disadvantage of these valves 
is that the ball or disk remains in the blood stream when 
the blood flows in the desired direction, and this causes 
a disturbance to blood flow. More recently, flexible leaflet valves have been 
proposed which mirror natural heart valves more closely. 
These valves have a generally rigid frame and flexible 
leaflets attached to this frame. The leaflets are arranged 
so that, in the closed position, each leaflet contacts 
its neighbour thereby closing the valve and preventing the 
flow of blood. In the open position, the leaflets 
separate from each other, and radially open out towards 
the inner walls of an artery in which the valve is located. 
The leaflets are either made from chemically treated animal 
tissue or polyurethane material. The leaflets must be 
capable of withstanding a high back pressure across the 
valve when they are in the closed position, yet must be 
capable of opening with the minimum pressure across the 
valve in the forward direction. This is necessary to  
 
ensure that the valve continues to correctly operate even 
when the blood flow is low, and to ensure that the valve 
opens quickly when blood flows in the desired direction. A wide range of geometries are used to describe 
natural aortic valve leaflets during diastole, but these 
geometries cannot be used for valves made from pericardial 
or synthetic materials due to the approximately isotropic 
properties of such materials compared to the highly 
anistropic material of the natural valve. Consequently, 
different
