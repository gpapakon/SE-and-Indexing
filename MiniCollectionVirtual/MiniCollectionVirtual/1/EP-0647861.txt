<ABSTRACT>
A double-periodic grating is described for obtaining polarization- 
independent 

filtering and coupling. The grating may be viewed as a combination 
of two 

gratings with slightly different grating periods. The two periods 
are carefully 

chosen to match the difference in propagation constants of the 
TE and TM 

polarization modes such that both modes are coupled at the same 
wavelength. 

A novel method of obtaining a double-periodic grating is described. 
Use in optical waveguide vertical couplers and filters is described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to grating-assisted optical wavelength selective 
couplers and, in particular, to couplers that are insensitive to the state of 
polarization of the incident signal. In order to use wavelength division multiplexing techniques in optical transmission 
systems, one requires efficient, narrow-band optical wavelength filters. In 
a paper entitled "Grating-assisted InGaAsP/InP vertical codirectional coupler filter" 
by RC. Alferness et al., published in the 6 November 1989 issue of Applied 
Physics Letters 55(19), pp. 2011-2013 there is described a four-part channel-dropping 
filter employing grated-assisted coupling between asynchronous optical 
waveguides. However, such devices are polarization dependent and will respond 
differently for the TE and TM modes. As a consequence, the amplitude of the 
dropped channel will fluctuate in such devices as the polarization of the input 
signal varies. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide 
optical filters that operate independently of the state of polarization of the incident 
light. In accordance with the present invention, polarization independent filtering is 
obtained by means of a double-periodic grating structure which may be viewed as a 
combination of two gratings with slightly different grating periods. The two 
periods are carefully chosen to match the difference in propagation constants of the 
TE and TM modes such that both are coupled at the same wavelength. It is shown that the double-periodic grating can be realized by multiplying 
two square wave grating functions, thus simplifying the fabrication of such devices. The principal of the invention can be applied equally to both two and four-port  
 
filters operating either in the transmission or reflection mode. FIG. 1 shows a prior art grating-assisted optical wave coupler; FIG. 2A shows the optical response of a double-periodic filter; FIG. 2B shows the optical response of a double-periodic filter wherein the 
TE and TM modes share a common transmission band; FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrate how a double-periodic grating is formed by 
multiplying rectangular gratings of different periodicity; FIG. 5 shows a four-port filter in accordance with the teachings of the invention; 
and FIGS. 6, 7 and 8 show alternate embodiments of the invention. Referring to the drawings, FIG. 1 shows a prior art grating-assisted, optical 
coupler comprising two, vertically coupled, optical waveguides 10 and 11. 
Essentially, the device comprises two, single-mode, asynchronous
