<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reader device
(hereinafter termed "laser scanner" for the sake of brevity)
for reading optical codes such as characters with different reflectance values,
for example bar codes.The use is known of two or more lasers, suitable to be
focused at different distances, inside a single scanner, so
as to increase the depth of field for the reading distance
in bar code readers. An example of this technique is
described in European Patent Application published on April
15, 1992 under Serial No. 0480348.In the known system, the lasers related to the various
distances are activated sequentially and alternately, one
for each scanning operation, and if one scan is found to
contain the code, all subsequent scans are performed by
the same laser, until the code remains present; once this
situation ends, scanning resumes with cyclic alternation of
the lasers.Another known method entails the activation of the
laser related to the reading distance by measuring, by means
of a barrier of photocells external to the scanner, the
height of the object that bears the code to be read.These systems have drawbacks: in the first case, the
actual scan rate is equal to the real scan rate divided by
the number of lasers being scanned; the second method
requires the use of external photocells and is furthermore
effective only if the objects on which the code is placed
have a regular shape. A defect of both systems is that only
one focusing is possible during an individual scan. In other 
words, it is not possible to simultaneously read two codes
that are aligned but located on planes that are at different
distances from the scanner.EP-0517958-A2 discloses a laser scanner comprising two laser systems focused for different
working ranges and selection means including a range finder for selectively activating one of
the two laser systems.The aim of the present invention is to improve the way a laser scanner reads an optical code
and calculates a distance of the scanned object from the laser scanner.This aim is achieved by a laser scanner according to claim 1 and by a method according to
claim 14.Document US-A-4 569 078 discloses the measure of the distance between a scanner and an object to be scanned by the measure of the phase-shift of the electric signal received from the sensor means relative to the modulating signal. However said measure of the phase-shift as used for detecting the shape of the three dimensional code and is therefore not in the field of scanners reading codes by detection of amplitude
