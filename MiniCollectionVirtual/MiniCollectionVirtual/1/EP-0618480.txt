<ABSTRACT>
In front of an exposure stage and behind the exposure 
stage, loop spaces are provided on the roll paper 

transporting path of a printing/developing apparatus. 
The movement of the exposure stage is ensured by the 

loop. When the roll paper is fixed, one loop space is provided 
in front of the exposure stage, and one loop space 

behind the stage, thus allowing the exposure stage to 
move. Alternatively the negative mask unit and lens unit 

of the apparatus are movable, so that roll paper is usable 
when the exposure stage is fixed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a printing/developing apparatus
for 3D stereoscopic photographs comprising a movable arrangement
of a negative mask, a lens unit and an exposure stage,
said exposure stage being arranged so as to move while holding
a portion of the printing paper thereon in a direction
parallel to the surface of the printing paper in a predefined
minute movement, during which movement the portion of the
printing paper is exposed a plurality of times while changing
the projection angle of said lens unit and said negative mask
for producing a 3D stereoscopic photograph.Particularly, the invention provides a printing/developing
apparatus suited for normal photographs or 3D steroscopic
photographs using a lenticular sheet. In particular, the present
invention provides a mechanism for transporting printing
paper in a printing/developing apparatus in which an exposure
stage or a lens unit is movably disposed with respect to a
negative mask.As a common method of preparing 3D stereoscopic
photographs using a lenticular sheet, an indirect method is
generally employed. In this method, a deep focused object
is photographed with a camera charged with a normal film
while the camera is moved horizontally or arcuately by a 
predetermined distance to prepare a plurality of negatives
which contain images photographed with different angles. In
these negatives, the position of images is shifted with each
other in accordance with the distance between the camera and
the object. Instead of taking photographs while a camera is
moved, it is also possible to use a camera which contains a
plurality of lenses aligned horizontally or a plurality of
horizontally disposed cameras, to effect a simultaneous 
photographing to obtain a plurality of negatives. Although
the number of the negatives is not particularly limited, it
is generally 3 to 5.In the indirect method, a plurality of negatives
obtained as above are exposed on a photosensitive sheet
composed of a lenticular sheet and a sensitized material
applied onto the flat face of the lenticular sheet, The
exposure is conducted in such a manner that the negatives
are exposed by the use of an ordinary projection lens but
with different projection angles to form images on the
photosensitive sheet. When an image of a negative is
projected onto the photosensitive sheet, the image is
divided parallel to the axis of the lenticular lenses in the
photosensitive sheet and compressed into a line. The
projected image forms discrete and compressed line images on
the sensitized layer of

<CLAIMS>
A printing/developing apparatus for 3D stereoscopic
photographs comprising a movable arrangement of a negative

mask (21), a lens unit (22) and an exposure stage (3), said
exposure stage (3) being arranged so as to move while holding

a portion of the printing paper thereon in a direction
parallel to the surface of the printing paper in a predefined

minute movement, during which movement the portion of the
printing paper is exposed a plurality of times while changing

the projection angle of said lens unit and said negative mask
for producing a 3D stereoscopic photograph, characterized in

that said apparatus is equipped with a magazine (1) for rolled
photographic printing paper and one loop space (14) for the

printing paper disposed in the transporting path of a
photographic printing paper at opposed positions with respect

to the exposure stage (3), and in that the exposure stage (3)
and the magazine for rolled paper (1) are connected together

so as to move together during said predefined minute movement.
A printing/developing apparatus according to claim
1, characterized in that said loop space (14) has a loop guide

(4) which is parallel to the surface of the exposure stage to
support the printing paper in the direction of transporting

when the exposure stage (3) does not need to be moved, and is
dropped down by rotation of a loop motor (8) for directing the

printing paper to a loop box (14) when the exposure stage (3)
needs to be moved.
A printing/developing apparatus according to claim
2, characterized by means for controlling the rotation of

transporting rollers (7) installed near the exposure stage (3)
such that the size of the printing paper loop in said loop box

is kept constant.
