<ABSTRACT>
Improvements in the regulation of fluid 
conditioning stations which comprise a plurality of 

pumping devices (2,3,4), at least one fluid storage 
reservoir (5,6), at least one pressure transducer and 

regulating means, the conditioning station providing a 
fluid at a certain pressure and flow for consumption, the 

pumping devices (2,3,4) starting and stopping such that 
the pressure in the fluid storage reservoir or reservoirs 

(5,6) is maintained between two limit values of pressure 
(the start pressure and the stop pressure), the 

improvements being characterized in that only one pumping 
device is started when the pressure in the storage 

reservoirs (5,6) reaches or exceeds the value of the start 
pressure and/or when the flow provided by the pumping 

devices (2,3,4) in operation is less than the consumption 
flow; and only one pumping device is stopped when the 

pressure in the storage reservoirs (5,6) reaches the value 
of the stop pressure and/or when the flow provided by the 

pumping devices (2,3,4) in operation is greater than the 
consumption flow. 
Operation is optimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for the
regulation of fluid conditioning stations which comprise a
plurality of pumping devices, at least one fluid storage
reservoir, at least one pressure transducer and regulating
means, the conditioning station providing a fluid at a
certain pressure and flow for consumption.In stations of this type the pumping devices are
started and stopped such that the pressure in the fluid
storage reservoir or reservoirs is maintained between two
limit values of pressure known as the start pressure, which
is determined according to certain minimum values that have
to be maintained, and the stop pressure, which is determined
according to the number of start-ups of the pumping devices
per unit time.The term "fluid conditioning stations" refers
herein especially to stations with compressors, both the
vacuum type and the type using gases above atmospheric
pressure. Vacuum pumps normally work at a variable suction
pressure and a constant output pressure. Most compressors,
on the other hand, work at a constant suction pressure and
a variable output pressure.The treatment stations described are designed to
transmit a certain power conditioning the variables pressure
and flow.The invention also relates to methods for the
regulation of stations which condition other variables such
as the temperature and flow of a fluid such as water or
thermal oil. The fluid may be of any type: solid, liquid or
gas. These stations have the problem of adapting the
pumping devices to the consumption, which is randomly
distributed and which may vary over a wide range of values.As has been said, the pumping devices start and
stop such that the pressure in the fluid storage reservoir
or reservoirs is maintained between two limit values of
pressure: the start pressure, which depends on certain
minimum values that have to be maintained, and the stop
pressure, which depends on the number of start-ups per unit
time.The starting and stoping of the pumping devices is
an ON/OFF operation and does not in any way take into
account the possibility of adapting the station to the
consumption.Therefore, in order to guarantee the consumption
requirements during peak hours, pumping stations tend to be
oversized. This leads to frequent starting and stopping,
since when the consumption is low the storage reservoirs are
emptied very quickly in the case of vacuum, or fill very
quickly in the case of positive pressures. The oversizing
also means that the stations work for long periods of time
consuming much more power

Method for the regulation of fluid

conditioning stations which comprise a plurality of pumping
devices (2,3,4), at least one fluid storage reservoir (5,6),

at least one pressure transducer and regulating means, the
conditioning station providing a fluid at a certain pressure

and flow for consumption, the pumping devices (2,3,4)
starting and stopping such that the pressure in the fluid

storage reservoir or reservoirs (5,6) is maintained between
two limit values of pressure known as the start pressure,

which is determined according to certain limit values that
have to be maintained, and the stop pressure, which is

determined according to the number of start-ups of the
pumping devices per unit time, whereby only

one pumping device is started when the pressure in the
storage reservoir or reservoirs (5,6) reaches or exceeds the

value of the start pressure and/or when the flow provided by
the pumping devices (2,3,4) in operation is less than the

consumption flow; and only one pumping device is stopped
when the pressure in the storage reservoir or reservoirs

(5,6) reaches the value of the stop pressure and/or when the
flow provided by the pumping devices (2,3,4) in operation is

greater than the consumption flow, the flows being measured
at the operating pressure.
Method according to claim 1, characterized
in that the difference between the flow provided by the

pumping devices (2,3,4) and the consumption flow is
determined from the change in pressure a after a certain

interval of time after a connection/disconnection, such that
if after this interval of time the pressure is still beyond

the start/stop pressure a new pumping device is
started/stopped; the interval of time depends on different 

parameters, such as the flow of the pumping devices, the
star/triangle switching time of the motors which drive the

pumping devices (2,3,4); and, exceptionally, in an
emergency the interval of time is reduced in order that the

pumping devices (2,3,4) become operational more quickly.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that when operating above atmospheric pressure, all the

pumping devices (2,3,4) stop if having exceeded the stop
pressure a safety pressure level is reached.
Method according to claim 1, characterized in
that the values of the start pressure and stop pressure are

different for each of the pumping devices (2,3,4).
Method for the regulation of fluid conditioning
stations which comprise a plurality of pumping devices

(2,3,4) starting and stopping such that the pressure in the
fluid storage reservoir or reservoirs (5,6) is maintained

between two limit values of pressure known as the start
pressure, which is determined according to certain limit

values that have to be maintained, and the stop pressure,
which is determined according to the number of start-ups of

the pumping devices per unit time, characterized in that
when the pressure in the storage reservoir or reservoirs

(5,6) reaches value of the stop pressure, stopping only
occurs as long as a certain number of starts/stops per unit

time for each pumping element is not exceeded, it being
possible, in a certain interval of time, to substitute

stopping for operation without pumping or for continuous
operation.

(2,3,4) starting and stopping such that the pressure in the
fluid storage reservoir or reservoirs (5,6) is maintained

between two limit values of pressure known as the start
pressure, which is determined according to certain limit

values that have to be maintained, and the stop pressure,
which is determined according to the number of start-ups of

the pumping devices per unit time, characterized in that
when the pressure in the storage reservoir or reservoirs

(5,6) reaches value of the stop pressure, stopping is
carried out for a single cycle, pre-defining the minimum

duration thereof, the time count being initiated as the
stop is carried out, being defined a minimum operating

duration.
Method according to claims 1, 5 or 6
characterized in that the difference between the flow

provided by the pumping devices (2,3,4) and the consumption
flow is determined from the known flow of each of the

pumping devices (2,3,4), the capacity of the fluid storage
reservoir or reservoirs (5,6) and the variation in pressure

per unit time, the pumping device or devices (2,3,4)
starting or stopping according to the consumption flows and

the most suitable combination of said devices.
Method according to claims 1, 5 or 6
characterized in that the start pressure varies according

to the load losses which increase with use and the build up
of dirt in the fluid treatment and/or conditioning chains.
Method according to claims 1, 5 or 6, in the
case that the flows generated by the pumping station are

different from the flows of the fluid treatment devices,
characterized in that devices are incorporated for the

coordination between the volumes generated by the pumping
station and treatment capacity without regenerative action, 

said devices comprising a device which generates a signal
which is proportional to the operating time and the flow of

each pumping device, a pre-selector to select the volume as
of which a coordination action is generated, a comparator

device which gives a signal when the signal from the
totalizer is greater than or equal to that of the pre-selector,

and a system for resetting the individual counter
devices proportional to the flow and the time.
Use of the method according to any one of the
previous claims in the regulation of fluid conditioning

stations, where the fluid is used as heat conductor and the
