<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus of the invention is a mounting bracket (10) comprising a relatively flat, elongated frame (12) having a front planar face (14), a rear planar face (16), and first and second opposing ends (18, 20) attachable to two corresponding wall studs (70). The frame (12) also has a central cut-out portion (26) which defines a top edge (28) and a bottom edge (30). An electrical box (40) and its accompanying faceplate (60) may be mounted between two wall studs (70) by first attaching the bracket (10) of the present invention to the wall studs (70). The open front end (48) of the box (40) is then placed flush against the rear face (16) of the bracket (10). The accompanying faceplate (60) is placed on the front face (14) of the bracket (10) opposite and aligned with the box (40). Mounted in this manner, the front end (48) of the box (40) will be substantially flush with the plane formed by the wall studs (70) regardless of the depth of the box (40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mechanical brackets for
mounting electrical boxes between studs in a wall and more
specifically to a mounting bracket which allows boxes having
different depths to be mounted on the same bracket.Brackets for mounting electrical boxes between wall
studs are used on a daily basis in the construction industry.
These brackets allow the builder to conveniently traverse the
space between the studs and mount an electrical box at any
location he chooses. A typical prior art bracket is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,967,990 issued to Rinderer. With
reference to Figs. 1 and 2 in Rinderer, the prior art bracket
comprises a bar 21 attached at both ends to a respective wall
stud S having a pair of integral elongate extensions 51 which
set the bar back from the front of the studs S. The bar 21
also has a plurality of pilot holes 45 for accommodating the
screws 13 for attaching the backwall of the electrical box B to
the bar 21. Because the length of the bar 21 is several times
the width of the electrical box, it can be used to mount a
plurality of boxes.In mounting bracket applications, it is desirable for
the front of the electrical box B, after mounting, to be 
substantially flush with the front portions of the two studs.
This is because a section of wall is set against the front of
the two studs, and it is desirable for the front of the
electrical box to be substantially flush with that section of
wall. The prior art bracket 21 fulfills this requirement
adequately when all of the boxes to be mounted on the bar have
the same depth. However, when boxes of differing depths are to
be mounted, the prior art bracket fails to provide satisfactory
results. To illustrate, suppose that a second box, having a
lesser depth than box B, is also mounted to the bar 21 shown in
Fig. 2 of Rinderer. Because of its lesser depth, the front of
the second box after attachment will not be flush with the wall
between the studs S, but instead will be recessed from the
wall. This is an undesirable result. Likewise, attaching a
box having a larger depth than box B will cause the front of
the box to extend beyond the wall between the studs S, and this
also is an undesirable result. Because boxes of various depths
are used regularly in the construction industry, it is
important for a mounting bracket to be capable of accommodating
boxes having different depths. The prior art bracket lacks
this capability. Therefore, there exists a need for an
improved apparatus and method for mounting electrical boxes
between two

A mounting assembly for attachment between two wall studs (70),
comprising:


a flat elongated frame (12) having a front planar face (14), a rear planar face (16), first
(18) and second (20) opposing longitudinal ends attachable to said wall studs (70), and, in its central part, a central cut-out

portion (26) defining a top edge (28) and a bottom edge (30), the top and bottom
edges having no apertures therein for accommodating a fastener;
an electrical box (40) having a plurality of sides (42) with a first depth, a back end (46),
and an open front end (48), the front end of said box placed flush with the rear face (16)

of said frame (12) with a portion of said box (40) contacting said top edge (28) and
another portion of said box contacting said bottom edge (30);
a faceplate (60) placed on the front face (14) of said frame (12) opposite and in alignment
with said electrical box (40), a portion of said faceplate contacting said top edge (28) and

another portion contacting said bottom edge (30); and
a fastener (84) inserted through the central cut-out portion for fastening said

electrical box (40) to said faceplate (60), thereby attaching the box and the faceplate
to said frame (12).
The assembly of claim 1, further comprising:

a second electrical box (A, B, C) having a plurality of sides with a second depth different
from the first depth, a back end, and an open front end, the front end (90) of said second

box placed flush with the rear face of said frame (12) with a portion of said second box
contacting said top edge and another portion of said second box contacting said bottom

edge;
a second faceplate placed on the front face of said frame opposite and in alignment with
said second electrical box (A, B, C), a portion of said second faceplate contacting said top

edge and another portion of said second faceplate contacting said bottom edge; and a
second fastener inserted through the cut-out portion for fastening said

second electrical box to said second faceplate, thereby attaching the second box and
the second faceplate to said frame.
