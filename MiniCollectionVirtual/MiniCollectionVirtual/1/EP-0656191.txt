<ABSTRACT>
A surgical clip applier (10) comprising a housing (12, 14), a pair of 
handles (22) pivotally connected to opposite sides of the housing, and a jaw blade 

assembly (17) fixedly connected to the housing. The jaw blade assembly includes a pair 
of jaws (34) for receiving and deforming a clip (42) therebetween and a clip carrier (40) 

for supplying a series of clips to the jaws. A channel assembly (16) is slidably mounted 
with respect to the housing and envelops the jaw blade assembly for camming the jaws 

closed upon closing of the handles. The clips may be fed to the jaws by a spring biased 
feed bar (18) which operates upon closing of the handles, or may be urged by pusher bar 

(90) which provides a biasing force to the clips to be retained by the jaws. The 
instrument may be used in conventional surgical procedures, or may be adapted for 

endoscopic and laparoscopic surgical procedures requiring the application of 
microsurgical clips.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to an instrument for applying to surgical clip to body
tissue, and more particularly to instruments for applying
and crimping plastically deformable vascular surgical clips for anastomoses of a
blood vessel in conventional surgical procedures and endoscopic or laparoscopic surgical
procedures. EP-A-409569 discloses such an instrument, which is in accordance with the precharacterising
part of claim 1 below. For later disclosures of similar instruments, see EP-A-538074,
US-A-5049152 and EP-A-507537.The term "anastomosis" covers a variety of procedures in which blood vessels
such as veins and arteries, or other tubular members, such as parts of the colon, intestines,
stomach, etc., are joined or reconnected. These vessels may be joined in a variety of relative
orientations, including end-to-end and end-to-side. Solid tubular structures such as peripheral
nerves can also be joined together, as well as solid structures such as subcutaneous tissue and
skin.The recent advances made in the field of microsurgery has led to the
development of alternatives to conventional suturing processes of joining vessels in order to
accommodate the minute size of the vessels, nerves and tissues being joined during
microsurgical procedures. These alternatives have also been developed with an eye towards
preventing thrombosis which tends to occur at the points of penetration of the needle and
sutures. An alternative to suturing is the use of surgical clips which are applied along the
vessel juncture to perform a holding function similar to that of sutures, but without
penetrating the vessel walls. Two such non-penetrating clips are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos.
4,586,503 and 4,733,664 to Kirsch et al. The former patent discloses a surgical microclip
formed of plastically deformable metal or plastic material having minimal spring-back when
crimped. The clip has a pair of parallel curved legs joined by a bridge at one end and
terminating in rounded tips at the other end. The clip grips the edges of adjacent and everted
tissue by crimping the legs together. The latter patent discloses a vascular surgical clip
comprising a plastically deformable body portion, a tang for deforming the body, and a neck
connecting the tang to the body, wherein the neck is designed to break upon application of a
predetermined excessive tensile force to the tang, and the body is designed to deform upon
application to the tang of less than the predetermined tensile force.As described in the above patents, the non-penetrating clips are

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (100) for applying and crimping plastically
deformable vascular surgical clips in vascular surgical

procedures comprising:

a handle portion (102, 104, 101, 103):
an elongate body portion (114) extending from said handle
portion:
a pair (118) of jaw members extending from said
body portion at an end opposite said handle portion

and movable between an open position for receiving
a clip (158) in a gap between the jaw members (118) and a closed

position for crimping a clip present in said gap, in
response to movement of said handle portion;
a plurality of plastically deformable, crimpable,
open clips (158) disposed within said body portion,

said plurality of clips being arranged in line such
that each clip in said plurality is contacted by at

least one other clip, said line having a distalmost
clip and a proximalmost clip; each said clip having

a pair of arcuate legs, spaced apart in an open
disposition of the clip but closer together after

the clip has been crimped; and
a camming mechanism (126) associated with said body
portion for camming said jaw members from said

open position to said closed position to crimp
closed the said distalmost open clip of said line; and 
pusher bar advancing means (134) for engaging and pushing said proximalmost
clip of said line (158), thereby distally advancing said line (158) of clips to urge

said distalmost clip (42) of said line (158) distally;

   
characterized in that
:

each said jaw member (118) has a raised portion (120) including an arcuate
portion (135) adapted each to conform in shape to one of the arcuate legs of the

distalmost clip (42) of said line (158) to arrest its distal movement
in the open position of said jaw members as said line

(158) is urged distally by said pusher bar advancing means (134); and
said raised portion (120) further including a stop portion against which abuts the
next-to-distalmost clip (42') as said line (158)

is urged distally by said pusher bar advancing means (134) when the jaw members (118) are in
their closed position to crimp the distalmost clip (42) of said line (158), but which

do not abut the said next-to-distalmost clip (42') of said line (158) when the jaw
members (118) are in their open position.
Apparatus for applying vascular surgical clips according to claim 1, wherein said jaw
members (118) are disposed at an angle with respect to a longitudinal axis of said body portion.
Apparatus for applying vascular surgical clips according to either of the preceding
claims,

wherein said handle portion includes a housing (102, 104) and a pair of handles (101, 103) pivotally
connected to said housing and actuable in a tweezer-like manner, each of said handles

having a proximal and a distal end and being pivotally mounted to said housing at
said proximal ends. 
Apparatus for applying vascular surgical clips according to claim 3, further
comprising first spring means (107) connected between said handles (101, 103); and

second spring means (148) biasing said pusher bar advancing means (134) in a distal direction to push
said distalmost clip to a position between said jaw members (118) in response to opening of said

handles.

Apparatus for applying vascular surgical clips according to claim 7, as dependent on
claim 6, wherein said channel (126) includes an elongate slot (251a) which slides over said keyway

post (185a) to permit longitudinal movement.
