<ABSTRACT>
A control system which provides a measurement of 
efficiency in a catalytic converter (50) coupled to the 

engine exhaust (56). For each inducted airflow range in 
which the engine (28) is operating, test periods are 

generated by counting transitions in the output of an 
upstream exhaust gas oxygen sensor (44). These test periods 

are limited to a maximum count. Concurrently, during each 
test period, transitions are counted in a downstream exhaust 

gas oxygen sensor (52). Upstream and downstream transitions 
are accumulated and a ratio of the accumulated totals 

determines converter efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and system 
monitoring efficiency of a catalytic converter positioned in 
an engine exhaust. It is known to use exhaust gas oxygen sensors 
positioned both upstream and downstream of a catalytic 
converter to provide air/fuel control of the engine. An 
example of such usage is found in U.S. Patent No. 5,115,639. Various approaches are also known to use the outputs of 
the upstream and downstream exhaust gas oxygen sensors to 
provide an indication of catalytic converter efficiency. In 
one such system, an increase in the amplitude output of the 
downstream sensor as compared to the upstream sensor 
provides an indication of converter degradation. In another 
type of system, the switching frequency of the sensor 
outputs are compared during steady-state engine operations 
under a particular combination of engine speed and load. There are numerous problems with the above approaches. 
For example, amplitude comparison has been found to suffer 
because exhaust gases from each of the combustion chambers 
may not be fully mixed in the exhaust manifold. 
Consequently, there may be variations in sensor amplitude 
which are caused by lack of exhaust gas mixing and not 
caused by catalytic degradation. With respect to those 
systems examining sensor switching frequencies, the inventor 
herein have discovered at least two significant problems. 
If the air/fuel feedback loop is in a transient state during 
the test such that combustion is on average either rich or 
lean of stoichiometry, there may be insufficient switching 
in the sensors to provide any reasonable indication of 
converter efficiency. Further, such systems do not examine 
converter efficiency over the full range of possible exhaust 
gas flow rates. Accordingly, inaccurate indications of 
converter efficiency may result.  
 An object of the invention herein is to provide 
monitoring of catalytic converter efficiency over a broad 
range of exhaust gas flow rates and to provide such 
monitoring while maintaining engine air/fuel operation at 
stoichiometry. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a method of monitoring the efficiency of a 
catalytic converter of an engine exhaust system, which 
comprises comparing electrical output signals of two exhaust 
gas oxygen sensors positioned upstream and downstream of 
the catalytic converter, respectively, characterised by the 
steps of -:

the engine has completed operation within each of a 

plurality of inducted airflow ranges for at least a minimum

determining when a preselected number of transitions from a 

first state to a second state has occurred in the exhaust
