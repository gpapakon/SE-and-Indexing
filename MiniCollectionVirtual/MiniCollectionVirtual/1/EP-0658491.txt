<ABSTRACT>
Hinged-lid boxes (10) for cigarettes consist of a box part (14) and a lid (15) which is connected thereto in an articulated manner. In order to secure the closed position of such a hinged-lid box (10), an insertion tab (40) is attached to a front wall (25) of the lid in extension thereof. When the hinged-lid box (10) is closed, said insertion tab is introduced into a gap (41) formed between a front wall (36) of a collar (35) and a front wall (16) of the box part (14).
