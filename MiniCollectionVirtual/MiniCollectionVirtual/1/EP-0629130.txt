<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF INTERLEUKIN-10 TO SUPPRESS GRAFT-VS.-HOST DISEASEField of the InventionThe invention relates generally to a method for treating and inhibiting graft-vs.-host disease or tissue rejection by administering to an afflicted individual an effective amount of interleukin-10.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to the use of interleukin-10 (IL-10) to suppress graft-vs.-host disease or the rejection of transplanted tissues. The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising interleukin-10 or active variants thereof. Preferably, the interleukin-10 of the invention is selected from the group consisting of the mature polypeptides having the open reading frames that are defined by the amino acid sequences given in SEQ. ID. NOS. 1 and 2 herein (all SEQ. IDs. are given immediately before the Claims), wherein the standard three- letter abbreviation is used to indicate L-amino acids, starting from the N-terminus. These two forms of IL-10 are sometimes referred to as human IL-10 (or human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor) and viral IL-10 (or BCRF1 ), respectively: e.g. Moore et al., Science, Vol. 248, pgs. 1230-1234 (1990); Vieira et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., Vol. 88, pgs. 1172-1176 (1991 ); Fiorentino et al., J. Exp. Med, Vol. 170, pgs. 2081-2095 (1989); Hsu et al., Science, Vol. 250, pgs. 830-832 (1990). More preferably, the mature IL-10 or variants thereof used in the methods of the invention are selected from the group consisting of the mature polypeptides having the open reading frames that are defined by the amino acid sequences given in SEQ. ID. NOS. 3 and 4 herein.Brief Description of the DrawingsFigure 1 is a diagram of the vector pcD(SRα) used for expressing IL-10 in mammalian cells. Figure 2 is a diagram of the vector TRP-C11 used for expressingIL-10 in bacteria. 

 Figure 3 shows plasmid pGSRG carrying the open reading frame (ORF) of mouse IL-10, viral IL-10, or human 1L-10 inserted into its Xhol restriction site; it also shows the sequence of the RBS-ATG-polylinker regions of the final construction (called TAC-RBS). Figure 4 shows the effects of endogenous and exogenous IL-10 on the proliferative responses in MLC. PBMC (1 x 105/well) and allogeneic irradiated PBMC (1 x 10-5/well) (PBMC donor A x PBMC donor B (A); PBMC donor B x PBMC donor A (B)) were cultured for 5 days in the presence of increasing concentrations of IL-10 (open bars) and anti-IL-10 mAb (solid bars). MLC were carried out in the absence (solid bars) or in the presence (hatched bars) of 100 U/mi IL-10
