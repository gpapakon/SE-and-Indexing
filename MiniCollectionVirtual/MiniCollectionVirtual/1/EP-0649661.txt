<ABSTRACT>
To reliably sterilize hospital refuse in the quantities and 
configuration in which it occurs on its collection, the plant (1) 

comprises a refuse loading device (2), a shredder (3), a motorized 
screw (12) for refuse conveying, a microwave oven (5) and a device 

(6) for removing the treated refuse on its exit from the oven (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hospital refuse sterilization plant.Hospital refuse cannot be disposed of by dumping because of its
potential infective power, and has therefore to be disposed of by
incineration. However, to prevent the contagion which it could
generate during the handling involved in its transport to the
incinerator, particular care has to be taken which further
increases the already high cost of disposal by incineration.The problems connected with overall safety and cost could be
solved if such refuse could be sterilized prior to its disposal.In such a case the refuse could be dumped as normal domestic
refuse. However the sterilization of hospital refuse in the
quantities and configuration in which it occurs on its collection
for feeding to disposal cannot be validly achieved with the hoped-for
efficiency, economy and guarantee of sterilization using
current equipment, because of the particular nature of hospital
refuse. Such refuse consists in fact of a heterogeneous mass of
randomly arranged objects which for safety reasons are
additionally placed in appropriate containers the purpose of which
is to provide at least temporary protection to the person required
to handle it within its area of occurrence. Specifically, 
hospital refuse usually contains infected containers such as
syringes, bottles, test tubes, vials and the like which form a
protected repository for germs because it is difficult for fluid
used for sterilization purposes to reach them. This happens
mainly if the infected container is sheltered from the sterilizing
fluid by being well within the interior of the mass of refuse.Existing sterilization equipment is not designed for proper
effectiveness against a heterogeneous mass of random objects such
as hospital refuse, but only against objects arranged non-randomly
and in only tendentially limited quantity within the equipment.Even if dimensioned for use for hospital refuse, the effectiveness
of such equipment is uncertain, and the sterilization time and
capacity for a given overall size and operating cost would
certainly vary considerably with the quantity of refuse to be
sterilized. Consequently, known equipment would involve much
higher times and costs the greater the mass of refuse to be
sterilized.EP-A-0 393 231 discloses a hospital refuse sterilisation plant
comprising a shredder, a shredded refuse conveying motorised
screw, an oven for the material to be treated and multiple
microwave generators for desinfecting moisturised material in
the oven.The object of the

<CLAIMS>
A hospital refuse sterilization plant (1)
comprising in combination the following components, listed in

the direction of advancement of the refuse within the plant:

a shredder (3);
a shredded refuse conveying and preheating device (4) formed
from a motorized screw (12) along which nozzles (13) are

positioned for spraying steam;
an oven (5) formed from an enclosure (14) for the material to
be treated, at least one microwave generator (15), and a device

(16) for generating steam and injecting it into said enclosure
(1
4), this latter upperly comprising a loading mouth (21) closable
by a valve (23) and lowerly comprising a discharge mouth (22)

closable by a sliding cover (24), said enclosure (14) being
internally lined with a layer of insulating and antiadherent

material (25), preferably teflon.
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
oven (5) is provided with a device (17) for measuring its extent

of filling, comprising a sensor positioned on the oven
circumference.
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
oven (5) is provided with a device (18) for the forced expulsion

of refuse, comprising an annular brush (34) in contact along its
entire length with the inner surface of the enclosure (14) and

movable vertically within it.
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
oven (5) is provided with a device (19) for cleaning the discharge 

mouth (22), formed by a brush (36) which rotates while
simultaneously translating along the entire width of the mouth

(22).
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised by comprising
a device (6) for removing the treated refuse leaving the oven (5).
A plant as claimed in claim 5, characterised in that the
refuse removal device (6) comprises a motorized screw (37).
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
shredder (3) is of the type comprising rotating toothed drums

(10).
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
oven (5) comprises several microwave generators (15) arranged on

two levels equidistantly about the circumference of the enclosure
(14).
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
steam generating device (16) injects the steam via equidistant

ports (43) positioned at the discharge mouth (22) of the oven (5).
A plant as claimed in claim 9, characterised in that the
steam generating device (16) produces steam at a temperature

indicatively of 160Â°C.
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the
cover (24) for closing the discharge mouth (22) can translate

horizontally relative to said mouth (22) by virtue of horizontal
guides (26) and cylinders interposed between said cover (24) and

said guides (26), and can be applied in a sealed manner to the 
discharge mouth (22) by vertically acting cylinder-piston units

(29) engaging slots (31, 32) provided in said cover (24).
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that a
chamber (39) for temporary accumulation of the shredded refuse is

provided between the shredder (3) and the refuse conveying and
preheating device (4).
A plant as claimed in claim 1, characterised by comprising
a device (2) for loading the refuse into the shredder (3).
A plant as claimed in claim 13, characterised in that the
device (2) for loading the refuse into the shredder (3) comprises
