<ABSTRACT>
There is presented for a multiprocessor-controlled system MPS, which has decentralised processor devices DZP arranged on electronic modules BG, an electronic module BG which can be used both for a loadable version of the system and for a system version provided with a PROM. To this end, the module BG has a first memory region ROM which is designed as a read-only memory and in which there is stored a loading sequence which controls program transfer to the module BG. Prior to initial commissioning of the module BG, the control program sequence for implementing the module function is stored in a second memory region FLEP which is designed as a flash EPROM, the flash EPROM being used to store a new control program sequence, which replaces the stored control program sequence and can be communicated by means of program transfer, when the module is contained in a loadable version.

<CLAIMS>
Electronic module (BG) having at least one
local processor device (DZP) of a multiprocessor-controlled

system (MPS), especially a digital
communications system, and having a memory for storing

control instructions for the processor device,
characterized by a first memory area constructed as

read-only memory (ROM) in which a loading sequence
controlling a program transfer to the module (BG) is

stored, and by at least one second memory area
constructed as flash EPROM (FLEP), in which a control

program sequence for implementing a module-related
function is stored before an initial start-up of the

module (BG) and which, in the case of a multiprocessor-controlled
system (MPS) constructed as loadable

version, is intended for storing a new control program
sequence transferred during the program transfer.
Electronic module according to Claim 1,
characterized in that, after the program transfer, the

control program sequence stored before an initial
start-up is deleted in the second memory area (FLEP).
Electronic module according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized by a first memory area (ROM) located in a

chip together with a microprocessor (CPU).
Electronic module according to one of the
preceding claims as subscriber line module in a digital

communications system.
