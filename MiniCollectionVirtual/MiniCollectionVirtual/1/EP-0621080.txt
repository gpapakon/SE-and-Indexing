<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a paint pump for paint-spraying systems (10), with a casing receiving a pump block (16, 17) which is connected to a paint-changing unit (12, 13) and to a paint-applying device (30) and which is loaded by a drive motor (M), the operation of which is subject to activation by a central control (32). At the same time, at least two separate pump blocks (16, 17) with separate functional blocks (20, 21) are provided, each pump block (16, 17) being assigned a respective paint-changing unit (12, 13), to which the pump block (16, 17) is connected, and, furthermore, each pump block (16, 17) being loaded by a common drive shaft of the drive motor (M).

<CLAIMS>
Paint pump for paint-spraying systems (10), 
having a housing which receives at least one pump unit 

(16, 17), in which housing pump elements are arranged, 
having in each case a port for connection to a colour 

changing unit (12, 13), and having a paint application 
device (30), and having a drive motor (M) which is 

provided to act upon the pump elements and whose 
operation is subjected to actuation by a central control 

(32), characterized in that the pump unit has at least 
two separate pump blocks (16, 17) with separate function 

blocks (20, 21), in that a colour changing unit (12, 13) 
connected to the pump unit (16, 17) is assigned in each 

case to each pump block (16, 17), and in that each pump 
block (16, 17) is acted upon by a common drive shaft of 

the drive motor (M). 
Paint pump according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the function blocks (20, 21) have logically 

controlled shut-off devices, in that the shut-off devices 
are actuated by the central control (32), and in that 

simultaneous supply of paint to the paint pump from more 
than one colour changing unit is ruled out. 
Paint pump according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each function block (20, 21) has at least one 

logically controlled shut-off device which is actuated by 
the central control (32). 
Paint pump according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that each function block has a flushing 

line (22, 23), through which cleaning agent fed into the 
respective paint flow path flows to a collection  

 
container (26, 27) for used cleaning agent, and has a 

paint line (24, 25) through which paint flows to the 

colour application device. 
Paint pump according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the flushing line (22, 23) and the paint line (24, 

25) can be shut off by logically actuated shut-off 
devices in the function block (20, 21).
