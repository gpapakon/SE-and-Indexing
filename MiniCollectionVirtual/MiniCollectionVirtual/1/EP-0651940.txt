<CLAIMS>
A harvesting machine (10) with a conveyor device (60) which picks up harvested
crop from the ground and passes it on to crop processing elements and comprises

spring tines (74, 100) carried on a rotating tine structure (67), effecting overshot
feeding, 
characterized in that
 the spring tines (74, 100) in the side end regions of the
conveyor device (60) have such a bending stiffness that a force of at least 84 N (19

lbf), preferably 336 N (76 lbf) is necessary to achieve a bending displacement of 41
degrees at the tip of a tine (75), while spring tines of smaller bending stiffness are

provided in the region lying in between.
A harvesting machine according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 spring tines (74, 100)
with two tines (75, 102) adjoining on a coiled intermediate part.
A harvesting machine according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 spring tines (74, 100)
with two tines (75, 102) adjoining on a straight intermediate part.
A harvesting machine (10) in the form of a round baler according to one or more of
the preceding claims, wherein the conveyor device (60) is located below an inlet (58)

of a baling chamber (56).
