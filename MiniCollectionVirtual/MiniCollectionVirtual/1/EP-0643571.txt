<ABSTRACT>
An active selective headset system characterized by a headset (51) having controller means (50) with an LMS adapter, feedback compensator and cancellation filter with reference microphone (54) and residual microphones (53) and speakers (52), where the controller means synthesizes an "anti-noise" to cancel the noise before reaching the ear canal. The headset which is selective, i.e., "anti-noise" signal cancels only the noise signal with minimal affect on speech and warning signal which pass to the ear canal.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ACTIVE SELECTIVE HEADSETThis invention relates to a headset to provide active, as opposed to passive, protection for a wearer/user. In industrial environments there is often a demand for active headsets that attenuate low frequency noise as well as noise covering the speech band (300 to 3300 Hz). While passive hearing protection works well at higher frequencies above 1000 Hz, active technology achieves similar levels of protection at the lower frequencies of 50 to 1000 Hz. The added problem of passive is that it also attenuates speech. The instant invention provides a solution that provides the protection offered by a passive headset in a light weight open-back design using any of several active control algorithms that selectively cancel only the damaging noise with minimal effects on speech and warning signals.In the past, attempts to combine the two protections i.e., high and low frequency attenuation, has resulted in not only the noise being attenuated but also the speech that the wearer needs to hear. Some systems met only limited success with fixed or "near-stationary" noise but not with the other noise of either (a) varying spectral characteristics or (b) brief duration noises with "spikes". Examples of such a system is found in U.S. Patent No. 4,025,721, to Graupe et al and U.S. Patent 4, 185, 168 to Graupe et al.Other systems that do not offer selectivity, i.e., allow speech and warning signals to be heard, include the BOSE headset found in U.S. Patent No. 4,455,675 and other headsets with similar designs (e.g., CARME Patent No. 4,833,719).The instant invention solves the problem now existant, that of total active attenuation of the noise by providing a solution of an active headset that can employ any of several selective algorithms such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,091,953 to Tretter, hereby incorporated by reference herein. Alternatively, it can employ the algorithm disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,105,377 to Ziegler which is also incorporated herein by reference. In addition it can employ other algorithms such as 

that disclosed in the application of Ziegler in U.S. Patent Application No. 07/421 759 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an active headset for canceling out undesirable noise and allowing speech in. Another object of this invention is to provide an open back headset with active selective cancellation of unwanted noise.These and other objects of this invention will become apparent when reference is

CLAIMS
1. An active selective headset system which allows a user to selectively actively attenuate both high and low frequency noise, said system comprising reference sensing means on said headset means adapted to sense speech, noise and warning signals, residual sensing means on said headset means adapted to sense remaining sounds entering the ear canal, speaker means on said headset means adapted to convey speech and warning signals to the user, and controller means adapted to selectively attenuate both high and low frequency noise so as to pass only the warning signals and noise to the user.
2. A system as in claim 1 wherein said controller means is adapted to employ a digital virtual earth algorithm.
3. A system as in claim 1 wherein said controller means is adapted to employ a synchronous algorithm.
4. A system as in claim 1 wherein said headset means includes at least one open back muff.
5. A system as in claim 4 wherein said reference sensing means includes an electret microphone.
6. A system in as claim 4 where said residual sensing means includes an electret microphone.
7. A system as in claim 4 wherein said speaker means includes a speaker mounted internally on said open backed muff. 


8. A system as in claim 1 wherein said controller means is adapted to employ an adaptive feedforward means.
9. A system as in claim 1 wherein said reference sensing means and said residual sensing means are the same.
