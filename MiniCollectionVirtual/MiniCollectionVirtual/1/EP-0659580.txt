<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a polyvalent metal salt of 
a salicylic acid resin which comprises the steps of reacting 

salicylic acid or its derivative with styrene or its 
derivative at a temperature of -20°C or higher but lower 

than 40°C in the presence of sulfuric acid, and then reacting 
the resulting reaction product with a polyvalent metal 

compound; an aqueous dispersion in which the polyvalent 
metal salt of the resin is dispersed in water; and a developing 

sheet in which the polyvalent metal salt of the 
salicylic acid resin is used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyvalent metal 
salt of a salicylic acid resin useful as a developer for a 
recording material for use in pressure sensitive record and 
the like, and a process for preparing the polyvalent metal 
salt of the resin. In addition, it relates to an aqueous 
dispersion in which the polyvalent metal salt of the salicylic 
acid resin is dispersed, and a developing sheet in 
which the polyvalent metal salt of the resin is used. It is known that metal salts of salicylic acid 
derivatives are useful as developers for pressure sensitive 
record, and methods for preparing and utilizing various 
salicylic acid derivatives and their metal salts have been 
heretofore disclosed. 
1. A 3,5-disubstituted salicylic acid derivative 
has been prepared from a corresponding 2,4-disubstituted 
phenol derivative and carbon dioxide by the utilization of 
the so-called Kolbe-Schaitt reaction (Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 25174/1976 and U.S. Patent No. 3,983,292).  
 
In this method, however, two steps are required to manufacture 
the 3,5-disubstituted salicylic acid derivative from 
phenol, and for the reaction of carbon dioxide, a specific 
high-temperature high-pressure device is necessary and so 
the inconvenience of facilities for the manufacture is 
present. Furthermore, when a metal salt of the 3,5-disubstituted 
salicylic acid derivative, for example, zinc salt 
of 3,5-di(α-methylbenzyl)salicylic acid is used as a developer 
for pressure sensitive record, there is a problem that 
a colored image disappears with water. 2. Another method is known in which 1 mol of 
salicylic acid is reacted with at least 2 mols of a phenyl 
ethanol derivative to produce 4-[α-methylbenzyl(α-methylbenzyl)] 
salicylic acid derivative (Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 61110/1993 and U.S. Patent No. 4754063). 3. Methods for preparing a polyvalent metal salt 
of 3,5-di(α-methylbenzyl)salicylic acid derivative and a 
polyvalent metal salt of 4-[α-methylbenzyl(α-methylbenzyl)]salicylic 
acid derivative are disclosed in which 1 
mol of salicylic acid is reacted with at least 2 mols of a 
styrene derivative in the presence of an aromatic sulfonic 
acid, and the resulting reaction product is then reacted 
with a polyvalent metal salt of an inorganic acid or a 
lower aliphatic carboxylic acid (Japanese Patent Publication 
No. 75736/1993 and U.S. Patent No. 4748259).  
 
When the polyvalent metal salt (e.g., a zinc salt) 
of 4-[α-methylbenzyl(α-methylbenzyl)] salicylic acid prepared 
by these methods is used as a
