<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a microwave
dielectric ceramic composition and, more specifically, it
relates to a microwave dielectric ceramic composition
having a high relative dielectric constant (hereinafter
referred to as "εr") while maintaining non-load Q factor
(hereinafter referred to as "Qu") and temperature
coefficient of resonance frequency (hereinafter referred to
as "τf") each in a range of practical characteristic, as
well as preparing method therefor.The present invention is applicable, for example, to
dielectric resonators in a microwave, microwave integrated
circuit substrates and impedance matching of various kinds
of microwave circuits.US-A-4,621,067 discloses a dielectric ceramic composition
comprising oxides of strontium, zinc, niobium and titanium,
which is represented by the following composition formula;
Sr1(Z1/3Nb2/3)1-xTixO3
wherein X is a value larger than 0 but not larger than 0.5.
The disclosed dielectric ceramic composition can be used not
only as a dielectric resonator or a material thereof but also
as a material of a dielectric substrate for a microwave IC or a
dielectric adjusting rod. Since the microwave dielectric ceramic composition
(hereinafter referred to as a "ceramic composition") has a
dielectric loss tending to increase as the working frequency
becomes higher, it has been desired for a ceramic
composition of large Qu in a microwave frequency region.As dielectric ceramic materials in the prior art,
there have been known, for example, a ceramic composition in
which a crystal structure has two phases of a perovskite 
phase and an ilumenite phase (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Hei
2-129065) and a ceramic composition comprising MgTiO3 and
TiO2 incorporated with a predetermined amount of CaTiO3
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open Sho 52-118599).However, the former ceramic composition contains
other ingredients such as Nd2O3, La2O3, PbO and ZnO in a
great amount and, in addition, the value for Qu is not
always high. The latter ceramic composition involves a
problem that τf varies greatly as from +87 to -100 ppm/ °C
in a mixing range of CaTiO3 from 3 to 10% by weight and it
is difficult to control it to a smaller value nearly equal
to zero.An object of the present invention is to overcome
the foregoing problems and provide a ceramic composition
having a high value εr while maintaining Qu and τf each
in a range of practical characteristic, as well as a method
of preparing the same.The ceramic composition according to the first
aspect of the present invention comprises a composition
