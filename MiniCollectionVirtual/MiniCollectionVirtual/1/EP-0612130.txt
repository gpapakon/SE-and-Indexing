<ABSTRACT>
The excitation cell has a multiplicity of rod-shaped electrode elements (1). Each electrode element is surrounded by a chemically and thermally stable protective jacket which can also withstand electric fields. The electrode elements are held in vertically running bridges (2, 2', 3, 3'). This provides a construction in a plurality of modules, each of which modules consists of electrode elements arranged one on top of another and two bridges. The electrode elements of each module are electrically connected to a conducting rail (11) and are at the same potential. The modules are alternately applied to phase and earth. The excitation cell described is largely insensitive to condensates, so that even humid or polymerising gases can be excited. In addition, the modular construction allows individual electrode elements to be replaced with ease.

Device for the non thermal excitation of 
vapours and gases by means of electric fields, which comprises 

several electrodes, wherein at least some or all 
of the electrodes are designed as spaced apart, substantially 

rod-shaped electrode elements (1), wherein the 
electrode elements (1) are grouped into modules, wherein 

each module comprises several, parallel electrode elements 
arranged in a vertical plane, wherein the electrode 

elements of a module are electrically connected to each 
other, characterised in that each electrode element is 

enclosed by a protecting cover (5,6,7) and that the electrode 
elements (1) are arranged substantially horizontally. 
Device of claim 1 characterised in that 
the electrode elements of a module are mechanically connected 

to each other by means of at least one cross-piece 
(2,2',3,3'). 
Device of one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that it comprises several modules 

arranged beside each other. 
Device of claim 3 characterised in that 
the modules are alternatingly on a first and a second 

electric potential such that modules lying beside each 
other are on different potentials. 
Device of claim 4 characterised in that 
the electrode elements (1) are arranged equidistantially 

in each module and that the modules are mutually displaceable. 
Device of one of the claims 4 or 5 characterised 
in that the at least one cross-piece (2,2',3,3') 

is connected to the protecting covers (5,6,7) of the 
electrodes (1), wherein at least a part of the protecting  

 
covers are surrounded by an at least partially conducting 

layer (9,10) in the area of the cross-piece, which layer 
lies on a given potential, such that the electric field 

is reduced in the area of the cross-piece. 
Device of one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that each protecting cover (5,6,7) is 

designed substantially as a tube, wherein the first end 
(6) of the tube is closed and the electrode element is 

introduced through the second end (7) of the tube, and 
wherein the tube is sealed at the second end against the 

electrode element (1). 
Device of one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the surfaces of the electrode elements 

(1) are designed uneven for improving the field 
homogeneity. 
Device of one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that stranded wires are used as
