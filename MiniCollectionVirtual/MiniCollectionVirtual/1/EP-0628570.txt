<ABSTRACT>
A method for the separation of at least one 
specific binding entity from a mixture of binding 

entities, comprising the steps of contacting said 
mixture of binding entitie
s with an immobilized 
peptide in which said peptide specifically binds to 

said specific binding entity, and separating the 
immobilized peptide/specific binding entity complex 

from the mixture of binding entities.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of synthetic 
peptides in the separation of complex mixtures of binding 
entities, and to the synthesis of peptides. In International Patent Application PCT/AU84/00039 
there is disclosed a method for the simultaneous 
synthesis of large numbers of peptides. This method is 
based on the solid phase synthesis of peptides onto 
polyethylene rods or pins as solid supports. In that 
patent application, it is pointed out that the technique 
would be useful for systematically determining the 
continuous antigenic determinants of various antigens by 
synthesizing all of the overlapping peptides which could 
be made from the sequence of the antigen and then testing 
for the ability of the peptide to bind to a binding 
entity such as an antibody. In effect, there is 
disclosed a method for a systematic and very rapid 
determination of the continuous B cell epitopes of an 
antigen. Subsequent research using this method has led to 
further developments which enhance the usefulness of 
peptides synthesized on inert rods or similar supports. 
These further developments relate to modifications to the 
earlier invention which extend its use in systematic  
 
studies in the field of immunology. Basically the 
modifications of the earlier invention allow for two 
different end results: elution of the binding entity from 
the peptide/solid support complex and harvesting of the 
peptide from the solid support. In general, the expression 'binding entity' as 
used throughout this specification means a macromolecule 
which binds specifically to another molecule. Examples 
of such 'binding entities' include antibodies reacting 
with the antigen which induced them; cellular receptors 
reacting with their ligand, eg., insulin receptors on 
cell surfaces binding insulin; and enzymes binding to 
their substrate. Equally, a binding entity can 
specifically react with an inhibiting molecule which 
prevents its normal function from being carried out; eg., 
enzyme inhibitors, antibiotics such as penicillin, and 
antagonists to cellular receptors. However, in this 
specification 'binding entity' generally has a more 
limited meaning and in this context implies the specific 
binding to a peptide or other molecule which was 
synthesized on the solid support or rod referred to 
above. In a first aspect, the present invention relates 
to the separation of complex mixtures of binding entities 
into a large number of individual and highly specific 
binding entities. In the earlier patent applications
