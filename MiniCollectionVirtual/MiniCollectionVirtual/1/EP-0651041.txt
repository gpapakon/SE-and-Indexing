<DESCRIPTION>
Generally, the present invention relates to a fixed
bed catalyst system for use in hydrotreating processes,
and, in particular, a catalyst system comprising a physical
mixture of catalyst particles with a large void and particles
with a low void.Hydrotreating of crude feedstocks encounters frequently
problems caused by solid contaminants in the feed-stock.In many refineries, serious problems arise in
hydrotreating reactors showing liquid maldistribution and
pressure drop build-up due to plugging of the reactors by
those solid contaminants.If solid material of certain particle size is
present in a feed-stock, it will deposit in the catalyst
bed. An appropriate grading technology is necessary in
order to control the deposition in such a way that the life
of the catalyst charge is determined by lack of catalyst
activity rather than flow restrictions or reactor plugging.
Traditionally control of reactor contamination has been
made by applying a grading of large particles on top of
smaller particles. Both particle sizes used have almost the
same void fraction, but the average size of the void spaces
is different and the ability to retain deposits is thus
different. By such a grading procedure, the deposits are
allowed to penetrate deeper in the bed, and a higher
contaminant uptake can, therefore, be attained before the
catalyst bed is plugged off. The particle size procedure
has the obvious draw back that the part of the reactor,
where the accumulation occurs, has a limited capacity for
contaminant storage. Exchange of large low void material
with high void material, e.g. rings in the reactor top, has
to a large extent improved the capacity for contaminant
storage without having bed plugging. However, situations
exists where the size of the contaminant particles is small
and/or the feedstock contaminant level is high, 
and where a layer of large particles/high void material
does not have adequate ability to retain contaminants and
plugging of subsequent layers can thus occur unless very
large volumes of large particles/high void material are
used.Based on the above observations, improved control
of deposition of solid material in a fixed catalyst bed
over a larger volume in the bed is obtained by appropriate
void grading of the catalyst bed with catalyst particles
having different void and optionally different activity. I
have found that appropriate void grading is obtained by
physically mixing catalyst particles having a large void
volume and particles with a low void volume in different
mixing ratios in
