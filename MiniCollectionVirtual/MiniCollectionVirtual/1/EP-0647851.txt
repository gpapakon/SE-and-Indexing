<ABSTRACT>
The encoder element (8) for a (rolling) bearing provided with a data acquisition assembly is solidly attached to a rotating ring of the bearing and cooperates with a sensor of the said data acquisition assembly for detecting the rotational speed of the bearing. It comprises an annular target (13) made of ferromagnetic material, provided with a cylindrical bearing surface (13a) for mounting on the rotating ring of the bearing and with a radial part (13b) in the form of a flat disc, with windows (13c) or notches, of identical size and regularly distributed along a circular path, and a bipolar annulus (14), axially magnetised and provided with axial ridges (14b), distributed regularly and circumferentially, which axially penetrates into the said windows or notches in the target.

Encoder element (8) for a rolling-contact bearing
equipped with an information sensor assembly, the said

encoder element being rendered integral with a rotating
race (1, 18) of the bearing and interacting with a

sensor (7) of the said information sensor assembly in
order to detect the speed of rotation of the bearing,

characterized in that it comprises an annular target (13)
made of ferromagnetic material provided with a cylindrical

bearing surface (13a) for mounting on the rotating
race of the bearing and with a flat disc-shaped radial

part (13b) with windows (13c) or slots of identical size
and uniformly distributed along a circular path, and an

axially magnetized bipolar ring (14) provided with axial
teeth (14b) which are uniformly and circumferentially

distributed and which penetrate axially into the said
windows or slots in the target, the free end of the axial

teeth exhibiting a magnetization of the same polarity.
Encoder element according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it further comprises a seal (15) overmoulded

onto the said bipolar ring (14) and the radial part (13b)
of the ferromagnetic target (13).
Encoder element according to Claim 1, characterized
in that it comprises a seal (15) overmoulded onto

the radial part (13b) of the ferromagnetic target (13)
and exhibiting an axial bearing surface (15d) provided

with a circumferential annular groove (15e) in order to
allow the mounting, by snap-fitting, of the bipolar

ring (14), the inner rim of which is provided with an
annular bead (14c) or with lugs interacting with the

annular groove in the seal.
Encoder element according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the bipolar ring (14) is

bonded onto the ferromagnetic target (13).
Encoder element according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the bipolar ring (14) is directly overmoulded

onto the ferromagnetic target (13), the free end
of the axial teeth (14b) exhibiting radial overhangs 

(14d) for rendering them axially integral with the
bipolar ring.
Encoder element according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the windows (13c) are

rectangular and of the same size.
Bearing equipped with an information sensor
assembly with outer rotating race (1) which race is

equipped with an encoder element (8) according to one of
the preceding claims.
Bearing equipped with an information sensor
assembly with an inner rotating race (18) which race is

equipped with an encoder element (8) according to one of
Claims 1 to 6.
