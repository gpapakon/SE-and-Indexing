<ABSTRACT>

with reduced generation of NOx wherein high velocity 

fuel and oxidant in a very low substoichiometric ratio 
are combusted and thereafter secondary oxidant mixes 

and combusts with the resulting combustion reaction 
products.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to combustion and
is particularly useful for carrying out combustion with reduced
generation of nitrogen oxides.Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are a significant pollutant
generated during combustion and it is desirable to reduce
their generation in carrying out combustion. It is
known that combustion may be carried out with reduced
NOx generation by using technically pure oxygen or oxygen-enriched
air as the oxidant as this reduces the
amount of nitrogen provided to the combustion reaction
on an equivalent oxygen basis. However the use of an
oxidant having a higher oxygen concentration causes
the combustion reaction to run at a higher temperature
and this higher temperature kinetically favors the formation
of NOx.DE-A-41 42 401 discloses a method for carrying out
combustion while achieving reduced generation of nitrogen
oxides comprising:
injecting primary fuel and primary oxidant into a combustion
zone in a ratio within the range of from 10 to 70
percent of stoichiometric, said primary oxidant being a
fluid having an oxygen concentration of at least that of
air; injecting secondary oxidant into the combustion
zone at a point spaced from where said primary fuel and
primary oxidant are injected into the combustion zone;
combusting primary fuel and primary oxidant within the
combustion zone separate from the secondary oxidant
to produce combustion reaction products; and mixing
secondary oxidant with combustion reaction products
within the combustion zone and thereafter combusting
secondary oxidant with combustion reaction products.US-A-5 242 296 discloses a combustion method
with reduced NOx generation employing two different
oxidants wherein the first oxidant incompletely combusts
fuel in a flame stream and a second oxidant having
a higher oxygen concentration than the first oxidant and
being injected spaced from the flame stream completes
the combustion.It is an object of this invention to provide a method
for carrying out combustion, which may be practiced using
an oxidant having a higher oxygen concentration
than that of air, while achieving reduced generation of
nitrogen oxides.The above and other objects, which will become apparent
to one skilled in the art upon a reading of this
disclosure, are attained by the present invention which
is :
A method for carrying out combustion while achieving 
reduced generation of nitrogen oxides comprising :
(A) injecting primary fuel and primary oxidant together

A method for carrying out combustion while achieving
reduced generation of nitrogen oxides comprising:


(A) injecting primary fuel and primary oxidant
together or separately into a combustion zone

in a ratio within the range of from 5 to 50 percent
of stoichiometric, said primary oxidant being a

fluid having an oxygen concentration of at least
90 volume percent, wherein when injecting primary

fuel and primary oxidant together in a
premixed condition, the mixture is injected into

the combustion zone at a velocity of at least 15
m/s (50 feet per second), and wherein, when

injecting primary fuel and primary oxidant separately,
the primary fuel is injected into the combustion

zone at a velocity of at least 15 m/s (50
feet per second) and the primary oxidant is injected

into the combustion zone at a velocity
less than that of the primary fuel;
(B) injecting secondary oxidant into the combustion
zone at a point spaced from where said

primary fuel and primary oxidant are injected
into the combustion zone;
(C) combusting primary fuel and primary oxidant
within the combustion zone separate from

the secondary oxidant to produce combustion
reaction products; and
(D) mixing secondary oxidant with combustion
reaction products within the combustion zone

and thereafter combusting secondary oxidant
with combustion reaction products.
The method of claim 1 wherein the secondary oxidant
is injected into the combustion zone from the

same side of the combustion zone as that from
which the primary fuel and primary oxidant are injected.
The method of claim 1 wherein the secondary oxidant
is injected into the combustion zone from the

opposite side of the combustion zone as that from
which the primary fuel and primary oxidant are injected.
The method of claim 1 wherein, when injecting the
primary fuel and primary oxidant separately into the

combustion zone, the velocity of the primary injected
oxidant is in the range from 6 to 15 m/s (20 to 50

feet per second).
The method of claim 1 wherein the secondary oxidant
has an oxygen concentration which is less than

the oxygen concentration of the primary oxidant.
The method of claim 1 wherein the secondary oxidant
is injected into the combustion zone at a velocity

greater than 15 m/s (50 feet per second).
The method of claim 1 wherein the secondary oxidant
is injected into the combustion zone at a velocity

which exceeds the velocity at which the primary
fuel is injected into the combustion zone.
