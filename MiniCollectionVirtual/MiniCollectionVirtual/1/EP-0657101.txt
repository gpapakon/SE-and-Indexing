<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for delivering a constant amount of dough per unit 
time is disclosed. Successive dough blocks (5) are transferred on to a first 

conveyor (8) at times proportional to their weights. The predetermined 
theoretical traveling distances of the dough blocks and the actual traveling 

distances of the dough blocks on the first conveyor are compared to find the 
change of the volume or specific gravity of the dough due to fermentation. 

Based on the comparison,the traveling speed of the first conveyor is changed to 
obtain a uniform amount of the dough product, and the gap between a second 

conveyor (11) and a stretching roller (12) may be adjusted to increase the rate at 
which the dough is produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for quantifying the amount
produced of dough for bread or confectionery, and in particular, to a method and
conveying apparatus for discharging or feeding,per unit time,a constant weight
of dough which is still under fermentation.U.S. Patent Nos. 5,079,014 and 5,118,274 respectively teach a method and
an apparatus for discharging or feeding a constant amount of dough per unit time.
U.S. Patent No. 5,079,014 discloses a method for automatically producing a
sheet of dough used for the production of bread or confectionery wherein the
manufacturing parameters, including the production speed, width, and thickness
of the sheet of dough, are previously stored in a computer memory, so that a
mass of dough supplied with a non-uniform width or thickness can be
automatically stretched into a sheet of dough that satisfies the conditions stored
in the computer memory.The apparatus of U.S. Patent No. 5,118,274 includes a dough-supplying
conveyor and a constant-speed delivery conveyor positioned in series with and
downstream of the supplying conveyor. The apparatus also includes a stretching
roller which reciprocates, a dough-width measuring device, and means for
changing the speed of the supplying conveyor in response to the signal produced
by the dough-width measuring device. The stretching roller is disposed above
the downstream end of the dough-supplying conveyor and the upstream end of
the delivery conveyor. As a thick continuous dough sheet enters the space
between the roller and the conveyors, it is stretched by the reciprocating roller.
When the amount of the dough transferred by the supplying conveyor to the
delivery one is greater than that discharged by the delivery one, the stretched 
dough becomes wider. The measuring device disposed near the roller detects the
width of the wider stretched dough, and based on the detection the control means
then lessens the speed of the supplying conveyor, so that the amount of the
dough fed by the supply conveyor to the delivery conveyor equals the amount
discharged by the delivery conveyor. Thus, in this apparatus a unit volume of
dough is delivered per unit time.However, if the dough is still under fermentation, the volume or specific
gravity of the dough changes between the times when it is placed on the supply
conveyor and when discharged from the delivery conveyor to a post-treatment
station, such as a product-making or dough-cutting one. This may cause a
drawback in that the products may differ from each other in

<CLAIMS>
A method for delivering a constant weight of dough per unit time,
including the steps of successively dividing a mass of dough under fermentation

into dough blocks of non-constant volumes, measuring the weights of the blocks,
passing the blocks to a supply conveyor provided with means for measuring the

traveling distance thereof, the blocks being laid on the supply conveyor with a
spacing proportional to the weights thereof, stretching the dough of the blocks by

causing the dough to pass through a predetermined gap thereby making the
dough a constant thickness, passing the dough to a delivery conveyor while

adjusting the speed of the supply conveyor based on the variation of the width of
the dough when the dough is stretched, wherein the theoretical traveling distance

of the dough and the actual traveling distance of the dough per unit time are
compared to obtain the rate of change of the specific gravity of the dough.

An apparatus for delivering a constant weight of dough per unit
time, comprising:


means (1) for supplying dough which is still under fermentation; 
scaling means (6) for receiving successive dough blocks of non-constant
volumes from the dough supplying means (1), measuring the weights of the

blocks, and discharging the blocks downwards;
a first conveyor (8) for receiving the blocks from the scaling means;
a second conveyor (11) disposed downstream of the first conveyor for
receiving the dough blocks from the first conveyor;
a stretching roller (12) disposed above the upstream end part of the second
conveyor and the downstream end part of the first conveyor, the roller being

spaced apart from the first and second conveyors and movable reciprocally over
the end parts of the first and second conveyors;
a width-sensor (13) disposed near the roller for detecting the width of the
dough stretched by the roller;
means (20) for controlling the speed of the first conveyor in association with
the width-sensor, the controlling means being adapted to measure the traveling

distance of the first conveyor for transferring each dough block, to cooperate
with the scaling means and the first conveyor so that the dough blocks can be

transferred at distances proportional to the weights thereof, and to determine the
ratio of the theoretical traveling distance to actual traveling distance per unit time

for each dough block.
The apparatus of claim 3, wherein the roller is movable so as to
adjust the gap formed between the roller and the conveyors.
