<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for scrolling information (12)
presented on a display of a mobile station. According to the invention a pointing

means (17) is moved on the active area of the display (15), and the displayed part of
the information(12, 13, 14) on the display (15) is scrolled in the direction of the

movement of the pointing means (17). The pointing means (17) can also be moved
on a touch surface. Said presented information (12, 13, 14) is left scrolling in the

direction of the movement when the pointing means (17) is moved outside the active
area of the display (15). The displayed part of the presented information (12, 13, 14)

is left scrolling, even if the pointing means (17) is lifted off the surface of the active
area of the display. The displayed part left scrolling will scroll at a rate retarding by

itself. Said presented information (12, 13, 14) is stopped by touching the active area
of the display (15) with the pointing means (17). The scrolling rate of said presented

information (12, 13, 14) on the display (15) is indicated by generating a sound
which is proportional to the speed of the movement. Said presented information (12,

13, 14) is arranged in the form of an imaginary cylinder (11) rotating in the display
(15), whereby the elements (13, 14) of a list (12), such as text and symbols, are

displayed on the outer surface of the cylinder (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The object of the invention is a method defined in the ingress of claim 1 and an
arrangement defined in the ingress of claim 12 in order to scroll data presented on a
display of a mobile station.Information such as facts, names and/or numbers concerning persons or things, are
often stored in the form of a list in the memory of a mobile station. Data relating to
the same fact form an element of the list.For selecting an element in a list there are known methods, which for selection
presents one or more alternative elements at a time on the display of the mobile
station. The scrolling of the list is controlled by a separate control means. However,
this way of action has a problem in that in small-sized devices generally only the
options presented on the display are visible because the displays are rather small and
in the present way they do not have space for several list elements at the same time.
The scrolling of the lists requires control means, such as keys or a rotatable knob,
which require space on the device surface. A mouse pointer can not be used in
small-sized devices, such as in present-day mobile stations, because no interface is
available for a mouse. Also in other respects a mouse pointer is not really suitable in
connection with a small-sized portable device.A disadvantage with prior art methods is that from a long list it is difficult to get
into view the list elements, such as names and/or numbers. With the current display
procedures only one or a few of the list elements at a time are visible in the device's
display, and there is not sufficiently space to display an element in its whole width
on the display. A further disadvantage is that a control means is required on the
device surface in order to handle the list.Known prior art in the field of scrolling information on a display include
US 4 954 967 A, which describes a method and an arrangement for determining the
direction and distance of one scrolling event from the length and speed of a pointer
movement across a touch-sensitive screen. An IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin
vol 38, no. 02, February 1995, page 423 illustrates a graphical object to be presented
on a display as an aid for facilitating easy scrolling. The publication US 5 495 566 A
illustrates how a display begins to scroll once the cursor wanders off an active
display area beyond a screen boundary, how the scrolling speed is made dependent 
on the times that scrolling has been initiated, and how cursor-driven scrolling is
combined with navigation key depressions. The

<CLAIMS>
A method for scrolling information (12, 13, 14) presented on a display of a
mobile station, comprising method steps in which a control area of the display is

touched with a pointing means (17), said pointing means (17) is moved in contact
with said control area of the display, and a displayed part of the presented information

(12, 13, 14) is scrolled (34) in the display (15), in a direction of a movement of
said pointing means (17), wherein :


said displayed part of the information (12, 13, 14) presented on the display of the
mobile station is left scrolling when the pointing means (17) is removed from said

control area of said display, 
characterized in that
:

said displayed part of the presented information (12, 13, 14) is stopped from
scrolling by touching said display control area with said pointing means (17).
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said displayed part,
which is left scrolling, is arranged to scroll at a rate measured for a vertical speed of

said pointing means (17) at the last moment before it was removed.
A method according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 said displayed part is
left scrolling if said speed exceeds a predetermined limit.
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
