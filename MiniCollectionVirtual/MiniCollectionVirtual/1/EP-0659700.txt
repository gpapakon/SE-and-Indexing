A corrosion-resistant fiberglass spinner is prepared by applying consecutive, 
alternating layers of chromium and nickel to the bores of the spinner, and thereafter thermally 

interdiffusing the chromium and nickel to form a corrosion-resistant coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to corrosion-resistant
coating for fiberglass spinner bores. More particularly, the invention is directed to a method
for applying chromium and nickel to fiberglass spinner
bores, to produce a corrosion-resistant
coating; and to
the fiberglass spinners produced thereby.In certain industrial applications, such as the production of fiberglass wool for
preparing thermal or acoustical insulation products, there is a need for metal alloys which
posses certain characteristics such as high rupture strength, high corrosion resistance, and
high oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. In the fiberglass and mineral fibers
industries, filaments which may be used for preparing such insulation products are produced
by passing molten glass or mineral through the bores of the foraminous wall of a chamber
which is adapted for rotation at high angular velocities (said chamber being known as a
fiberglass spinner). The filaments are extruded through the fiberizing bores due to the
centrifugal action of the rotating spinner. Such spinners are typically operated at a
temperature of about 1,121°C (2,050°F) and an angular velocity of about 2,050 RPM. It is
advantageous, from a fiberglass production cost standpoint, for the angular velocity to be as
high as possible so as to maximize the rate at which filaments are extruded through the
fiberizing bores. However, high spinner angular velocities result in reduced spinner life due 
to the limited corrosion resistance of typical spinner base metal alloys. The flow of molten
glass or mineral through the spinner bores corrodes the cylindrical walls of the bores causing
them to enlarge, resulting in a loss of control of fiber diameter.It is well-known in the fiberglass manufacturing art to apply a layer of
platinum or other precious metal or alloy over the surfaces of base metal components which
contact the molten glass, to reduce the corrosion of the base metal alloy by the glass. The
bores of fiberglass spinners are especially susceptible to corrosion caused by molten glass.
Johnson, D. C. "Platinum Coating Technique Developed for the Glass Industry," Glass,
September 1987, page 372 discloses a method for applying a platinum coating to the surfaces
of fiberglass spinner bores. The platinum coating is bonded directly to the spinner base metal
alloy. Platinum and other precious metals are expensive, however, and therefore dramatically
increase the costs associated with producing a corrosion-resistant spinner. Moreover, it has
been found that platinum
