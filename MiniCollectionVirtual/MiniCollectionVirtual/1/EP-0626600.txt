<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
waveguide module used in an optical communication network 
or the like and manufactured by connecting an optical 
waveguide holder and optical fiber holders and a method 
of manufacturing the same. In recent years, with the progress of techniques in 
optical communication, optical information processing or 
the like, it is strongly desired to achieve connection of 
a single mode transmission optical fiber (to be 
abbreviated as a single mode fiber hereinafter) and an 
optical waveguide constituting an optical coupling 
circuit or an optical branching circuit with high 
reliability. In this case, the diameter of the core of a 
single mode fiber is about several µm to 10 µm. 
Therefore, when a single mode optical fiber is connected 
to an optical waveguide, the relative positional shift 
between them must be reduced to be 1 µm or less to prevent 
an increase in connection loss. Conventionally, when an optical waveguide is 
connected to a single mode optical fiber, their relative  
 
positions are aligned while monitoring the connection 
loss. The contact surface of a holder for holding the 
optical waveguide is abutted against the contact surface 
of a holder for holding the optical fiber to achieve 
positioning with minimum connection loss. The butt 
portion between these holders is fixed by an adhesive or 
laser welding. A refractive index matching agent such as 
a matching oil is used on the connecting portion between 
the optical waveguide and the optical fiber to prevent 
reflection of light. In a conventional optical waveguide module, optical 
fiber connectors connected to optical fibers are coupled 
with the two sides of an optical waveguide substrate 
having an optical waveguide with, for example, 1 x 8 
branches through a refractive index matching agent. This 
optical waveguide substrate is mounted on a stainless 
steel optical waveguide holder having a substantially 
U-shaped section. Each optical fiber connector is 
mounted on a stainless steel optical fiber holder having 
a bottom surface and a substantially U-shaped section. A single mode optical fiber whose coating portion is 
removed is buried in one optical fiber connector. A 
plurality of single mode optical fibers whose coating 
portions are removed and whose connecting end portions 
are coupled with each other are buried in the other 
optical fiber connector. The butt portions between the  
 
optical waveguide holder and the optical fiber holders 
are integrally formed by UV bonding or spot
