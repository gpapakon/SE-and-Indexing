<ABSTRACT>
A high voltage semiconductor structure (10) includes 
a semiconductor substrate (11) of a first conductivity 

type. The structure (10) also includes a first region (12) 
providing a main rectifying junction, a second region (13, 

17, 21) of a second conductivity type formed in the 
semiconductor substrate (11) and surrounding the first 

region (12) and a third region (14, 18, 22) of the second 
conductivity type. The third region (14, 18, 22) has 

reduced conductivity and greater junction depth (36) 
compared to the second region (13, 17, 21). The third 

region (14, 18, 22) surrounds and is in contact with the 
second region (13, 17, 21) to form field rings which 

improve (increase) breakdown voltage of the high voltage 
semiconductor structure (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates, in general, to the field of high voltage
semiconductor devices, and, more particularly, to a floating field ring having
improved breakdown characteristics.High voltage semiconductor devices employ a variety of techniques to
reduce surface breakdown effects limiting performance of such devices. Edges
of doped regions tend to have cylindrical or spherical shapes resulting in higher
electric fields being formed under reverse bias in portions of the depletion region
at semiconductor device surfaces. These higher fields often result in avalanche
breakdown at substantially lower voltages than expected based on the electric
fields associated with the remainder of the device.A variety of techniques have been developed to control the electric field
geometry in depeletion regions at p-n junction edges. These include beveling
device edges, in areas forming depletion regions, by chemical and/or mechanical
techniques or creating one or more "floating field rings" or junction termination
extension techniques. Beveling techniques can be labor intensive and require
large depletion regions (circa 100 micrometers) in order to place the beveled
region in coincidence with the depletion region with sufficient accuracy to be
effective. Floating field rings increase breakdown voltages but require
substantial area and do not achieve breakdown voltages expected for the bulk
of the p-n junction. Junction termination techniques relying on (usually
laterally) graduated doping provide near-ideal avalanche-limited breakdown
voltages but tend to be implemented using photolithographic and doping
techniques susceptible to processing variations which can reduce yields and/or
provide sub-optimal device performance.Another technique of using guard rings to provide high breakdown
voltage is disclosed in European patent application no. EP-A-0124139. What are needed are methods and apparatus for providing high voltage
devices having improved breakdown voltages and acceptable area
requirements and which are realized through robust processing techniques.Briefly stated, there is provided a new and improved high voltage
semiconductor structure as recited in claim 1 of the accompanying claims.FIG. 1 illustrates a highly enlarged cross-sectional view of a portion
of a high voltage semiconductor structure in accordance with the present
invention;FIG. 2 illustrates a highly enlarged cross-sectional view of the
portion of FIG. 1 at an early stage in processing; andFIG. 3 illustrates a highly enlarged cross-sectional view of
