<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method are provided for discriminating
noise in a received signal. The apparatus comprises a first

signal processing means, a second signal processing means, a
threshold generating means for generating a threshold value.

The first signal processing means generates iteration signal
samples and predicted iteration signal samples, compares the

iteration signal samples and predicted signal samples to
generate a predicted error parameter. The second signal

processing means generates a threshold adjustment value based
on generated successive iteration signal samples. A logic

means logically treats the prediction error parameter, the
threshold adjustment value and the threshold value to generate

a noise indication value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of this application is related to that in our 
copending applications 93302855.7 (0.571.079). 93302856.5 (0.574.117) 
and 93302854.0 (0.571,078). In certain types of communications systems. such as systems 
employed with wireless telephone systems. information conveyed via 
analog signalling is received by a receiver in a series of encoded 
representations of information. generally in the form of a series of 
"1"'s and "0"'s established via frequency shift keying (FSK) at high 
frequency. Such transmissions may be subject to reflection such as 
from buildings and other objects in the transmission path. so there are 
sometimes radio frequency (RF) signals arriving at a receiver which are 
time-delayed with respect to other received signals in a manner which 
may interrupt or distort reception. As a result. the demodulator (or 
decoder) of the receiver may erroneously convert received signals. 
thereby becoming unstable and producing interference. Such 
interference is  
 
generally perceived by a user of such a system in the form of 
popping or clicking sounds or other distracting noises. It is common in the communications industry to compensate 
for interference or other noise by providing a feedback 
circuit with a delay whereby one can estimate the noise 
component of the received signal, generate a duplicate 
approximation of the noise component, and subtract that 
approximate noise component from the original signal to 
eliminate the noise received in the incoming signal. However, 
an industry standard published for wireless telephones and 
similar systems requires that no delays be introduced in such 
systems; i.e., the system must be what is commonly known as a 
real-time system. Consequently, a solution for eliminating 
noise in such a system must likewise be a real-time system. Real-time noise discrimination and suppression systems 
have been designed to quickly discriminate and suppress noise 
in an incoming signal and to effect muting in a manner which 
does not prevent understanding received speech when the 
invention mistakenly triggers on true speech. However, when 
using these noise detection systems, it is possible that high 
amplitude tones and saturated or clipped speech generated in 
the transmitter and encoded and sent to the receiver are 
decoded by the receiver. If the encoding and decoding method 
is a method such as Adaptive Differential Pulse Code 
Modulation ("ADPCM"), the decoder may reconstruct the signal 
in such a way that the decoder output signal is
