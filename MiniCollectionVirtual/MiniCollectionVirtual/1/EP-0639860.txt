<ABSTRACT>
A non-volatile semiconductor memory is disclosed comprising a 
plurality of basic blocks each having a plurality of non-volatile 

memory cells connected in series. For one of said 
memory cells a floating gate (16) is displaced in the direction of 

extent of a control gate (17) to partially cover from substantially 
the center of a channel region to one of the boundaries of the 

channel region in the direction of extent of said control gate (17), 
and for another of said memory cells said floating gate (16) is 

displaced in the direction of extent of said control gate (17) to 
partially cover from substantially the center of said channel 

region to the other of the boundaries of the channel region in 
the direction of extent of said control gate (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-volatile semiconductor
memory according to the preamble of claim 1, which is known
from JP-A-62 54 962.A ROM, the storage contents of memory cells of which can be
electrically erased and changed, is known as an EEPROM
(electrically erasable programmable ROM). When compared with an
EPROM, EEPROM can be used more easily since data are erased
with electric signals while being mounted on a circuit board,
so that demand for use with various control circuits, memory
cards or the line are rapidly increasing. A large scale EEPROM
in particular which is used when changing date in a floppy disk
has been recently desired.Figs. 1A to 1C show the structure of the memory array of a
conventional NAND type EEPROM suitable for large scale
integration. Fig. 1A is a plane view of the pattern. Fig. 1B is
a cross section along line A-A' of Fig. 1A, and Fig. 1C is a
cross section along line B-B' of Fig. 1A. Referring to Fig. 1A,
a portion enclosed by a broken line and indicated at 10
represents one NAND basic block. As understood from Fig. 1B,
this NAND basic block 10 is partitioned from other NAND basic
blocks disposed in the right/left direction as viewed in Fig.
1B by field oxide films 12, 12, ... The vertical cross section
of the NAND basic block 10 is as shown in Fig. 1C.
Specifically, referring to Fig. 1C in particular, reference
numeral 11 represents a p-type silicon semiconductor substrate,
13 a common source region made of an n+ diffusion layer and
shared by respective basic blocks 10, 14 a drain region of the
NAND basic block 10 which region is also made of an n+
diffusion layer, 15, 15, ... source/drain regions of memory
cells within the NAND basic block 10 which regions are made of 
n+ diffusion layers, 16, 16, ... floating gates made of a first
polysilicon, 17, 17, ... control gates made of a second
polysilicon layer, 18 a first select gate constructed by
electrically connecting together the first and second
polysilicon layers, 19 a second select gate constructed by
electrically connecting together the first and second
polysilicon layers, 20 a data line, 21 a contact connecting the
drain region 14 and the data line 20, 22 a gate oxide film
formed between the floating gate 16 and the substrate 11 and
having a thickness of, e.g., about 100 Å (10nm), 23 a gate
insulating film formed between the floating gate 16 and the
control gate 17 for which the film has a thickness of about
300 Å (30nm) and a three-layered structure of, e.g., ONO
(oxide-nitride-oxide), 24 an insulating
