<ABSTRACT>
A sequential amplifier having at least two amplifier 
stages (46,50) separated by a delay device (48) such that 

switching means may energize the amplifier stages to obtain 
maximum gain of the input signal so long as no oscillations 

occur between stages, thus allowing a signal to be 
amplified by adjacent amplifier stages without the adverse 

effects of feedback associated therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to amplifiers in general and
more particularly to amplifiers for use with weak signals
for radio frequency (RF) and audio frequency applications.
The invention is ideally suited for use in radio and
television receivers. However, it will be appreciated that
the invention can be used in any electronic device where
weak signals are to be amplified and signal gain is to be
increased.Radio receivers have been in existence for almost a
century. The earliest receivers were extremely crude in
design and consisted of no more than a crystal receiver
with a simple diode connected to a pair of headphones. The
diode and headphone combination acted as a detector/low
pass filter wherein an RF signal generated by the crystal
was detected by the diode and the low frequency aspect was
passed by the headphones while the higher frequency carrier
was blocked. These circuits included a so-called "cat's
whisker" wherein a wire comprising the cat's whisker would
be placed against various spots in the crystal detector.
The process of moving the cat's whisker from one location
to another was a crude form of station tuning whereby the
frequency at which the crystal was oscillating was
essentially shifted slightly thereby causing the crystal to
act as a detector/demodulator for that given frequency.
Thus, the signal was effectively demodulated and the audio
portion could be heard in the headphones.This crystal detector type of radio suffered from many
disadvantages. Among those were a lack of sensitivity,
poor station selection and low power. The low output power
was witnessed by the fact that only a few stations could be
detected by the radio.To overcome these disadvantages, tuned radio frequency
(TRF) receivers were developed. TRF receivers gave
improved selectivity, sensitivity and output power by
adding radio frequency and audio frequency amplifier 
stages. The purpose of TRF receivers was essentially to
enhance signal gain and the result was that more stations
could be detected and heard over speakers as well as with
headphones.A significant problem with this type of receiver was
distortion. This distortion resulted from the occurrence
of positive feedback between amplifier stages. The
distortion problem was particularly acute at higher
frequencies. Higher frequencies were more difficult for
the receiver to process due to the fact that the various
leads comprising the receiver signal processing stages
would act as "mini antennae" radiating the signal into all
parts of the receiver and thereby
