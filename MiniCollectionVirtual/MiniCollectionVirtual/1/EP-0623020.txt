<ABSTRACT>
Pyropheophorbide compounds are injected into a host and accumulate in tumor tissue to a higher degree than surrounding normal tissues. When the pyropheophorbide compounds are exposed to a particular wavelength of light the compounds become cytotoxic and destroy the tumor or diseased tissue without causing irreversible normal tissue damage. The pyropheophorbide compounds have shown improved results as compared to drugs currently used in photodynamic therapy. Further, they absorb light further in the red, optimizing tissue penetration and are retained in the skin for short time periods relative to other drugs used in photodynamic therapy.

 PYROPHEOPHORBIDES AND THEIRUSE IN PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPYCross-ReferencesThis application is a continuation-in-part of our earlier filed application Serial No. 07/597,786 filed October 15, 1990 which is a continuation of application Serial No. 07/221,804 filed July 20, 1988 which is now U.S. Patent 5,002,962 issued March 26, 1991 both of which are incorporated herein by reference and to which we claim priority under 35 USC §120.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to photosensitive therapeutic compounds and photodynamic therapy (PDT) . More particularly, the invention relates to pyropheophorbides, formulations that contain such and their use in the treatment of cancer.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAs described in U.S. Patent 5,002,962, porphyrin related compounds accumulate at higher concentrations in tumor tissue as compared to normal tissue, and that irradiation of these compounds using light of the proper wavelength results in an energized form which, upon decay, results in cytotoxicity. It is believed that excitation of the porphyrin or related material results in the formation of singlet oxygen which is in fact the toxic agent. However, the compounds administered apparently do not degrade in this process. 

 Literature relating to the use of "hematoporphyrin derivative" (HPD) describes this process utilizing a preparation obtained when hematoporphyrin dichloride is treated using the procedure of Lipson, R.L., et al, J National Cancer Inst (1961) 26.:l-8. More recently, it has been shown that if this hematoporphyrin derivative is treated at a suitable pH, aggregation occurs and the active material in the mixture can be prepared in crude form as a size segregated aggregate (see, for example, U.S. Patent 4,649,151, incorporated herein by reference) . This preparation is commercially- available under the trademark Photofrin.The preparation marketed as the Photofrin composition is a mixture. The mixture contains porphyrins joined by ether linkages (Dougherty, T.J., et al, Adv Exp Med Bio (1983) 2---60..3-13) , and more recently, Kessel, D., et al Photochem Photobiol (1987) 46.^463-568, has shown that ester linked porphyrins are contained in this mixture as well. Scourides, P. .; et al, Cancer Res (1987) 41:3439-3445 have synthesized an oligomeric mixture of ether linked porphyrins starting from hematoporphyrin dimethyl esters. The mixture was active in PDT, but was as complex a mixture as the Photofrin preparation. Dimers of hematoporphyrin joined by ester linkages have also been prepared
