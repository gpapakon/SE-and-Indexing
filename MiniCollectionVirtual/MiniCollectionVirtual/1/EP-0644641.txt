<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a power-cable joint accessory intended to be mounted on a stripped terminal part of this cable and to provide the dielectric strength around this stripped terminal part, the cable comprising a conducting core and, in succession around the core, an inner semiconducting screen, a dielectric layer, an outer semiconducting screen and an external protective jacket (sheath); the accessory comprises a first part intended to reconstitute the dielectric layer, and a second part and a third part which together are intended to reconstitute the inner and outer semiconducting screens respectively, characterised in that the first and second parts of the joint accessory are produced identically and simultaneously, made of an insulating polymeric matrix containing at least one conductive polymer which is incorporated, into the polymeric matrix, with a mass fraction such that the resulting electrical conductivity of the first and second parts is less than 10
<

Power cable jointing accessory (12) fitted to a stripped end part of said cable (10)
and adapted to provide insulation around said stripped end part, said cable

including a conductive core (1) and, in succession around said core, an inner
semiconductor screen (2), a insulative layer (3), an outer semiconductor screen (4)

and an outer protective sheath (5) and said accessory including a first part (7)
reconstituting said insulative layer, associated second (7) and third (11) parts

reconstituting said inner semiconductor screen and said outer semiconductor
screen respectively, characterized in that said first and second parts of said

jointing accessory are made identically and simultaneously from an insulative
polymer matrix containing at least one conductive polymer incorporated in said

polymer matrix with a concentration by weight such that the resulting electrical
conductivity of said first and second parts is less than 10
-14
 S/cm for DC use and
less than 10
-10
 S/cm for AC use, and in that said third part (11) has an electrical
conductivity less than 1 S/cm.
Accessory according to claim 1 and constituting a sleeve with an internally
shouldered bore partly surrounding at least the outer semiconductor screen and

the underlying insulative layer of said cable and having in a first end portion of
said bore (17, 18, 19) an inside cross section substantially identical to the outside

cross section of one of the two peripheral layers defined by said outer
semiconductor screen and the outer protective sheath of said cable, characterized

in that said sleeve (8, 9) has over a second portion of said bore (18, 19) an inside
cross section substantially identical to the cross section of said core and a single

shoulder between said first and second portions of said bore (18, 19).
Accessory according to claim 2 characterized in that it has a single right-angle
shoulder between said first and second portions of said bore (18).
Accessory according to claim 2 characterized in that it has a single frustoconical
shoulder between said first and second portions of said bore (19).
Power cable fitted with the accessory according to any one of claims 2 to 4

characterized in that said end part of said cable is stripped continuously and
simultaneously from at least said outer semiconductor screen (4) to said core (1)

and carries said accessory (8, 9, 21) of appropriate inside cross section in contact
with the stripped end part.
Power cable according to claim 5 and connected by a connection member to 
another power cable with a stripped end part, characterized in that said accessory

is moulded directly onto said connection member (20) and at each end thereof
onto the stripped end parts of said cables (10A, 10B) and constitutes with said

connection member a joint between said cables.
