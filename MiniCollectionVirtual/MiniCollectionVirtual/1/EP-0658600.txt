<ABSTRACT>
Moulding compositions comprising, as essential components,   A) from 1 to 50 % by weight of polyarylene ethers in which at least 0.03 % by weight of hydroxyl end groups, based on the molecular weight Mn (number average) of polyarylene ethers, are ..., B) from 5 to 94 % by weight of polyarylene ethers in which less than 0.03 % by weight of hydroxyl end groups, based on the molecular weight Mn (number average) of polyarylene ethers, are ...,   C) from 5 to 94 % by weight of polycarbonates,   D) from 0 to 50 % by weight of fibrous or particulate fillers and   E) from 0 to 40 % by weight of impact-modifying rubbers,   F) from 0 to 40 % by weight of further additives, where components A to F add up to 100 % by weight.
