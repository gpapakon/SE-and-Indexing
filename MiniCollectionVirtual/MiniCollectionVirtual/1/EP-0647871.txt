<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
manufacturing a substrate having on the surface thereof 
window-shaped coating films and a frame-shaped, 
functional coating film having the functions of screening 
unnecessary light and achieving desirable properties. 
The method of the present invention is useful for 
producing a color filter used in a color liquid display 
(LCD), particularly a matrix type color liquid display 
formed by using a thin layer transistor (TFT). Liquid crystal displays have so far been used 
for goods with a small-sized display such as the so-called 
pocket-sized television. However, the size of 
liquid crystal displays has rapidly been enlarged in 
recent years. The image quality of liquid crystal 
displays has also been improved by the development from 
TN liquid crystals to STN liquid crystals and active 
driving elements exemplified by a TFT, which has enabled 
the commercialization of goods with a liquid crystal 
display having as high image quality as cathode-ray 
tubes. Various studies have been conducted for 
improving the image quality and productivity of the 
color displays. Of these studies, the method for 
forming a light screening film called a black matrix 
that prevents light leakage toward the TFT and improves the  
 
image quality and the shape of the light screening film 
are of great concern. As the method for forming a frame-shaped, 
functional film (black matrix) at the regions not 
occupied with window-shaped colored coating films for 
the production of a color filter, there are known 
methods utilizing printing techniques such as silk 
screen method, offset method, etc. There is also known 
a method of forming a thin film of a metal such as 
chromium on a substrate by sputtering or the like and 
thereafter forming a black matrix by photo-lithography 
and etching. The study of a method of directly forming 
a black matrix by photo-lithography has been spurred by 
the recent development of negative photoresist 
compositions containing a black pigment. There is also 
known a method for forming a functional coating film as 
a black matrix in the gaps of stripe-form colored 
coating films, which comprises forming stripe-form 
colored coating films on a plurality of parallel stripe-form 
conductive circuits arranged on a transparent 
substrate by an electro-deposition method; coating a 
negative photoresist composition capable of giving a 
functional coating film on the whole surface of the 
substrate so as to cover the stripe-form colored coating 
films,
