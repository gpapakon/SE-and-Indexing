<ABSTRACT>
Air-assisted flat-jet device for spraying a coating product, comprising a coating-product supply valve (6) delivering a stream of paint, characterised in that an insert (20) located downstream of the needle (7) of the said valve converts the said stream into a hollow jet of paint. The hollow stream of paint is easier to shape by means of the horn air, and the flat jet is obtained with a minimum pressure and flow rate of horn and spray air.

<CLAIMS>
Air-assisted flat-jet spray device for a coating 
product, comprising a coating-product feed valve (6) 

delivering a stream of paint, a spray nozzle (10) and 
shaping air orifices (14, 15) directed towards the stream 

of paint exiting the said nozzle, characterized in that 
an insert (20, 120) which includes an annular channel 

(22) is housed in the said nozzle downstream of the 
needle (7) of the said valve and converts the said stream 

into a hollow jet of paint. 
Spray device according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the said spray device is of the type having a 

high volume and low pressure of atomizing air. 
Spray device according to either of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the insert (20, 120) 

includes several inlet channels (21) on the side facing 
the needle (7) of the valve (6), the said channels 

communicating with the annular channel (22). 
Spray device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the hollow stream of paint 

is atomized at the exit of the insert and then shaped 
into a flat jet by jets of air emanating from horns (13
a
, 
13
b
). 
Spray device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the hollow stream of paint 

has a radial velocity component on exiting the insert 
(120). 
Spray device according to either of Claims 3 and 
5, characterized in that the central internal part (127) 

of the channel of the insert includes a frustoconical  
 

end (128) forming a deflector. 
Spray device according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the insert (20) includes an 

axial drill-hole (25) in which a charging electrode (26) 
is housed. 
Spray device according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the electrode (26) extends beyond the insert (20) 

by a length (L) sufficient for it to be in contact with 
the compressed stream of paint.
