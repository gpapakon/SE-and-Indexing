<ABSTRACT>
The driving studs (35, 37) necessary for driving a shuttle-type embroidery machine are brought into the desired position by means of an actuating member (53). The driving studs (37) each have a shift bolt (51) which projects approximately at right angles and which projects through a recess (49) in the form of a long hole in the supporting profile (17) into the path of an adjustable switch (53). The switch (53) possesses a pivotable U-profile (55) with jaws (59) and a draw key (57). To adjust the driving studs (37), the switch (53) is moved along the oscillating beam (15) when the latter is in the lower position. The U-profile (55) is in each case pivoted into the desired position in front of the next driving stud (37). The jaws (59) displace the shift bolt (51) of a driving stud (37) to be adjusted, in each case somewhat beyond the mid-position, so that the draw key (57) can convey the driving stud (37) into the end position. Driving studs (37) which do not have to be adjusted are not taken up by the switch (53).

<CLAIMS>
A shuttle embroidering machine comprising shuttles 
(33) which run along tracks (13) and are drivable by 

upper and lower driver pins (35, 37), the positions of 
at least the upper or the lower driver pins (35) or 

(37) being adjustable by at least one actuating means 
(53, 81) movable in the longitudinal direction of the 

rocker beam (15), characterised in that the positions 
of the driver pins (35) or (37) are individually 

adjustable by the adjusting means. 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to claim 
1, characterised in that the actuating means (53, 81) 

is in the form of at least one diverter (53) which can 
co-operate with the driver pins (37). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to claim 
2, characterised in that the diverter (53) is disposed 

on a carriage or slide (61). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to claim 
2 or 3, characterised in that the driver pin (35) or 

(37) has an indexing pin (51) which projects 
approximately at right angles and can be actuated by 

the diverter (55) when the rocker beam (15) moves in 
the longitudinal direction. 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the diverter (53) 

has a pivotable guide key.  
 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the diverter has a 

pivotable U cross-section (55) with conically tapering 
jaws (59) and a draw key (57). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 3 to 6, characterised in that the actuating 

means (53, 81) is movable by a toothed belt. 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to claim 
1, characterised in that the actuating means has 

connections (109, 111) for coupling a power source to 
the driver pins (37'). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to claim 
8, characterised in that the driver pins (37') are 

actuated by compressed air. 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to claim 
9, characterised in that the driver pins (37') are 

disposed so as to be movable in a bore (83) in a block 
(85), the rear end of each driver pin (37') being in 

the form of a piston (86) which divides the bore (83) 
into two cylindrical chambers (87, 89), and in that the 

chambers (87, 89) are connected to the surroundings via 
respective ducts (91) and (93). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 8 to 10, characterised in that the actuating 

means (81) has at least two outlet opening (109, 111) 
for compressed air which communicate with the 

compressed-air-actuated driver pins (37') when the 
rocker beam (15) is in a specific position and can be  

 
supplied with compressed air through 
a controllable 
valve (121). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 8 to 11, characterised in that the actuating 

means (81) can be raised against the block (85). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the driver pins 

(37, 37') are lockable at least in the respective end 
positions. 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 1 and 8 to 13, characterised in that the driver 

pins (37') have grooves (101, 103) in which an O-ring 
(105) engages in the respective end position of a 

driver pin (37'). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to claim 
13 and 1 - 7, characterised in that the indexing pins 

(51) are guided in respective sockets (45) which have 
constrictions (73) for locking the driver pins (37). 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 1 to 15, characterised in that a plurality of 

actuating means (53, 81) are provided. 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 1 to 16, characterised in that the actuating 

means (53, 81) is disposed on parts of the embroidering 
machine which do not move during the actual 

embroidering process.  
 
A shuttle embroidering machine according to any of 
claims 1 to 17, characterised in that the actuating 

means (81) is moved and positioned by means of a rack 
and pinion. 
An embroidering machine according to any of claims 
1 to 18, characterised in that a control unit is 

provided and controls the actuating means (53, 81) in 
accordance with an embroidering pattern previously 

loaded into a memory in the control unit, in order 
individually to set the driver pins (35, 37) to one or 

other position.
