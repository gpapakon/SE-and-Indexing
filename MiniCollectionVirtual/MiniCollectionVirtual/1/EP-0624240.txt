<DESCRIPTION>
Prior to the present invention, considerable time has 
been required in setting up, emplacing and aiming towed 
field artillery pieces such as, for example, howitzers. 
The present method for accomplishing this, which has 
changed little since the inception of field artillery, 
involves a survey to establish a common azimuth reference 
for each of the field artillery pieces in a battery, with 
subsequent optical alignment of each artillery piece to 
insure that said piece is aimed in the direction of a 
target. The required optical alignment features panoramic 
telescope (PANTEL) apparatus. Thus, in summary, the prior 
art method requires an advance party to accomplish the 
survey, establish an aiming circle and emplace the field 
pieces for subsequent firing. Even under optimum 
conditions, this method is time consuming and critical to 
the success of a field artillery battery, and exposes 
personnel involved in the method to enemy counterfire. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to 
provide a method which reduces the time required for 
setting up, emplacing and aiming towed field artillery 
pieces while reducing the personnel required for same, as 
well as reducing the exposure of the required personnel to 
enemy counterfire. It is another object of this invention to provide a 
method for the purposes described which is effective in 
unfamiliar locations and under adverse weather conditions. It is yet another object of this invention to provide 
a method which improves the location and aiming capability 
of a field artillery battery and enhances the success of 
the battery mission.  
 EP-A-0159392 discloses a fire control system for mobile weapon 
carriers, e.g. tanks, having primary stabilization of a sighting 
device and primary or secondary stabilization of the weapon, 
which comprises a single strap-down central sensor block having 
two biaxial dynamically balanced gyros, and three monoxial 
accelerometers, with digital read out of measured values, and a 
digital computing unit processing the measured values to provide 
primary stabilization of the sighting device, and substantially 
simultaneous secondary stabilization of the weapon, providing 
fire control information. The present invention relates to a method for aiming a plurality 
of towed field artillery pieces in a battery of said pieces, each 
battery having a single mobile gyrocompass and location system 
and a single fire direction center, comprising: mounting each of 
a plurality of heading reference systems on a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method for aiming a plurality of towed field 
artillery pieces (4, 6, 8, 10) in a battery (2) of said pieces, each battery (2) 

having a single mobile gyrocompass and location system (30) and 
a single fire direction center (28), comprising: 


mounting each of a plurality of heading 
reference systems (12, 14, 16, 18) on a corresponding one of the plurality 

of field artillery pieces (4, 6, 8, 10); 
activating the mobile gyrocompass and location 
system (30) for storing azimuth alignment and grid location 

data for each of the field artillery pieces in a battery; 
initializing each of the heading reference 
systems to an arbitrary heading; 
transporting the activated mobile gyrocompass 
and location system (30) to each of the field artillery pieces, 

in turn; 
transferring the stored azimuth alignment and 
grid location data for each piece from the mobile 

gyrocompass and location system (30) to the heading reference 
system mounted to said each piece, in turn, until all of 

the pieces are in azimuth alignment and are grid located, 
and displaying said azimuth alignment and grid location; 
transporting the activated mobile gyrocompass 
and location system (30) to the fire direction center (28) for the 

battery; and 
transmitting (42, 44, 46, 48) heading and location data from the 
fire direction center to each azimuth aligned and grid 

located piece, and displaying said transmitted data for 
enabling a gunner to correct the aim of said each piece 

during a firing mission. 
A method as described by claim 1, wherein 
transferring the azimuth alignment and grid location data 

for each piece from the mobile gyrocompass and location 
system (30) to the heading reference system mounted to each 

piece includes: 

mounting an alignment plate to a "slave" gyro (54) in 
the heading reference system mounted to each piece; 
temporarily disposing a "master" gyro (33) included 
in the mobile gyrocompass and location system on the 

alignment plate, for each piece, in turn; 
electrically connecting (56) each "slave" gyro (54) to the 
"master" gyro (33); 
entering azimuth alignment data from the mobile 
gyrocompass and location system into each heading 

reference system, in turn; 
the mobile gyrocompass and location system 
storing grid location data from the respective field 

artillery piece in the mobile gyrocompass and location 
system; and 
displaying the azimuth alignment and grid 
location data for each field artillery piece. 
A method as described by claim 1, wherein 
transmitting heading and location data from the fire 

direction center (28) to each azimuth aligned and grid located 
piece (4, 6, 8, 10) and displaying said transmitted data includes:
 
   connecting the fire direction center (28) to each 

piece through a ground cable (42, 44, 46, 48) from the fire direction 
center to said each piece. 
A method as described by claim 2, including: 

sensing data corresponding to the attitude of  
 

the turret (59) of each field artillery piece; and 
displaying said sensed data with the azimuth 
alignment and grid location data for each field artillery 

piece. 
A method as described by claim 4, wherein 
said sensed data 

includes sensing 
elevation, roll and pitch data. 
A method as described by claim 1, wherein 

activated mobile gyrocompass 
and location system is transported between each of the field artillery pieces, 

in turn and the 
fire direction center by 
disposing the mobile gyrocompass and location 
system on a vehicle (32) and driving said vehicle to effect 

said transporting. 
A method as described by claim 2, wherein 
activating a mobile gyrocompass and location system for 

providing azimuth alignment and grid location data for 
each of the field artillery pieces includes: 


activating the "master" gyro (33) for providing a 
north reference; and 
activating a global positioning system (34) for 
providing the grid location of each of the field artillery 

pieces.
