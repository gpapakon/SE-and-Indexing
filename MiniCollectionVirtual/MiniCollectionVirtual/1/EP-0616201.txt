<ABSTRACT>
A housing for a heat meter consists of a basic device (1) and of a number of similarly-shaped option modules (2) which can be plugged on, the option modules (2) being able to be plugged in successively on one side surface (9) of the basic device (1) in any desired sequence by means of a latching device or a sealable fastening device. Each option module (2) has a second side surface (9'') corresponding to the side surface (9) and a first side surface (9') matching the side surface (9). Each option module has, furthermore, on the first side surface (9') a plug and socket coupling matching a plug of the basic device and a sealing ring (10) surrounding the plug and socket coupling, the sealing ring (10) lying on the side surface (9) of the basic device (1) or one of the already plugged-on option modules (2) so as to be spray-water-proof in the case of a plugged-on option module (2). The modular construction enables each of the plugged-on option modules (2) to be able to access all the currently measured, calculated and accumulated values of the basic device (1) via the electrical bus connection. In this way, additional functions can be realised without the heat meter having to be exchanged for this purpose.
