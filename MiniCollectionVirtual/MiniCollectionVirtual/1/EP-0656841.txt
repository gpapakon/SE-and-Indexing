<ABSTRACT>
In order to permit rapid torque matching of a vehicle drive (7) to changing slippage conditions on rails or roads without necessarily any knowledge of the vehicle speed, a revolution speed control with subsidiary torque control is used. A fuzzy regulator (1) to search for maximum adhesion, the input of which is connected to the output of a speed control (6), supplies an acceleration correction factor (bk) on the output side to a summator (3) to which is supplied an actual acceleration (bistF) corresponding to the acceleration of the vehicle. This vehicle speed is formed from an actual revolution speed signal (nist) derived from a driving wheel of the drive system (7) by differentiation and subsequent averaging via a low-pass filter (8). The summator (3) is connected to the speed control (6) via an integrating amplifier (4) and a further summator (5).
