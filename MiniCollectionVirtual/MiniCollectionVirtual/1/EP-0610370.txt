<DESCRIPTION>
 CAPACΓΠVE THERMOELECTRIC DEVICEThis application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S.S.N. 07/784,544, filed October 29, 1991. Background of the InventionThis invention relates to solid state thermoelectric devices, and particularly relates to thermoelectric device materials.Conventional solid state thermoelectric devices operate based on the Peltier effect, which is achieved by passing an electric current through a junction of dissimilar metals. Such a device is typically constructed from two semiconductor blocks, one being a heavily doped n-type material and the other being a heavily doped p-type material. The blocks are connected electrically in series and thermally in parallel. In this arrangement, heat is absorbed at a so- called cold junction of the semiconductor blocks and is transferred to a so-called hot junction at a rate proportional to the current passed through the semiconductor blocks. hen the current is applied in series with the n-type and p-type blocks, electrons pass from a low energy level in the p-type material to a higher energy level in the n-type material. This diode-like action causes heat to be removed from the cold junction of the two blocks and pumped through the blocks (in parallel) to the hot junction.Bismuth telluride is currently the most popular semiconducting material used for Peltier effect thermoelectric devices. It exhibits high mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and low thermal conductivity, three desirable characteristics for a thermoelectric device. Commercially manufactured bismuth telluride Peltier devices can achieve temperature differentials of approximately 65°C, and can pump tens of watts of heat.Summary of the Invention In general, in one aspect, the invention features a thermoelectric device comprising two electrodes separated by an electrolyte. Each of the electrodes comprises a crystalline material characterized by the presence of van der Waals 

 channels, the van der Waals channels being capable of accommodating the electrolyte within the channels to form a double layer of charge at interfaces of the van der Waals channels and the electrolyte when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. The thermoelectric device exhibits a temperature decrease in a two-stage cooling process comprising application of a voltage between the electrodes to thereby form the double layer and replacement of the voltage with a load through which the double layer is discharged. Using selected materials, the thermoelectric device of the invention
