<ABSTRACT>
A device for inspecting the filter end face of a 
filter cigarette is provided with an optical 

sensor(15) having an aperture ring(24) for emitting a 
measuring light toward the filter end face and 

receiving the light reflected from the filter end face 
and outputting a detection signal corresponding to the 

luminous energy of the reflected light, a hood(25) for 
covering the aperture ring(24) of the optical 

sensor(15), a plurality of injection holes(29) for 
injecting compressed air into the hood(25), and a 

processing unit for determining whether the filter end 
face is normal or not in accordance with the detection 

signal output from the optical sensor(15).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for
detecting a defect in a charcoal filter of a manufactured filter cigarette according to the
preamble of claim 1.Such a device is known from US-A-3,818,223.
Moreover, US-A-2,896,854 discloses a hood enclosing
the aperture of a scanner, said hood is protruding from
the aperture and has a hood mouth located on the same axis
as the aperture, and blowing means for supplying compressed air
into said hood and exhausting it through the hood mouth. Various types of filters of filter cigarettes
are known. One of the types of filters of filter
cigarettes is a dual filter shown in Fig. 1. The dual
filter has a charcoal filter member Fc containing
charcoal particles and a white plain filter member Fp
and these filter members Fc and Fp are arranged on the
same axial line in order from the end of a cigarette
C.Therefore, the charcoal particles are not
exposed to the filter end face and the filter end face
can be kept white because the filter end face remote
from the cigarette C is made of the plain filter
member Fp. Moreover, no charcoal particle enters the
mouth of a smoker when he or she smokes.The filter end face of the dual-filter-type
filter cigarette must be inspected in its
manufacturing process. As a result of the inspection,
a defective filter cigarette to whose filter end face
charcoal particles are exposed or through which
charcoal particles are seen must be removed from the
manufacturing line.For example, an optical sensor can be used to 
inspect a filter end face. The optical sensor emits
measuring light toward the filter end face of a filter
cigarette and simultaneously receives the light
reflected from the filter end face to output a
detection signal corresponding to the luminous energy
of the reflected light as a voltage signal. The level
of the detection signal output from the optical sensor
changes in accordance with the state of the filter end
face as shown by a solid line in Fig. 2.More specifically, the defective state of a
filter end face is classified into a completely-defective
state and a semi-defective state. A
completely-defective filter end face is defined as a
filter end face made of the charcoal filter member Fc
with no plain filter member as shown in Fig. 3. A
semi-defective filter end face is defined as a filter
end face with an insufficient length of the plain
filter member Fp as shown in Fig. 4. At the semi-defective
filter end face, charcoal particles in the
charcoal filter member Fc are seen through the plain
filter member Fp.Therefore, in the

A device for detecting a defect in a charcoal filter of a
manufactured filter cigarette transferred on

manufacturing line, the filter having a filter end face
to be inspected, comprising:


sensing means (15) for measuring a state of the filter
end face of the filter, said sensing means (15) including

an aperture allowing a measuring light to be emitted
therethrough toward the filter end face of the filter of

the filter cigarette and a reflected light from the
filter end face to received therein, and outputting a

detection signal corresponding to luminous energy of the
receiving reflected light and indicative of the state of

the filter end face; and
determining means (34) for comparing the detection signal
output from said sensing means (15) with a criterion and

determining whether the filter end face of the filter is
defective or not, based on the comparision result,

characterized in that said determining means (34)
includes shifting means (37) for shifting the base level of the detection

signal (S1) output from said sensing means (15) by a predetermined
value to prevent bad influences caused by the light reflected from portions other than the filter

end face to be inspected; and by comprising a hood (25) enclosing the
aperture of said sensing means and protruding from the

aperture, said hood having a hood mouth coaxially located
with respect to the aperture; and
blowing means (27-30) for supplying compressed air into
said hood and exhausting the supplied compressed air

through the hood mouth (26).
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the hood mouth (26) has an inner diameter smaller than

that of the aperture.
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that
said blowing means includes a ring member (27) arranged

the ring member to inject the compressed air from the

annular chamber (28) into the ring member (27).
The device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the shifting means has a clamping circuit for outputting

a shifted detection signal (S2) produced from the
