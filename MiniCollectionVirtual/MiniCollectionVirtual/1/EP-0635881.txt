<ABSTRACT>
A silicon carbide LOCOS vertical MOSFET formed on a 
silicon carbide substrate (55) with portions of epitaxial 

layers (57, 59, 60) defining the various transistor 
electrodes (83, 85, 87), rather than defining the electrodes 

with implants and diffusion. Because of the low diffusion 
rate in silicon carbide, the LOCOS (75) operation can be 

performed after the doped epitaxial layers are formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to methods of 
fabricating MOSFETs and to the devices and more particularly 
to methods of fabricating silicon carbide vertical MOSFETs 
utilizing LOCOS procedures and to the devices. There is currently a growing demand for power devices 
which offer improved operating efficiency and higher speed. 
Power MOSFETs have inherently higher switching speeds than 
bipolar transistors and thus are strong candidates for use 
in high frequency switch mode power supplies and inverters. 
The fabrication of MOSFETs include many diffusion and wet 
etch steps to form the various electrodes of the device in a 
substrate of silicon or the like, which materials are 
readily susceptible to such process steps. However, silicon and the like have a relatively low 
breakdown voltage and poor thermal conductivity, resulting 
in devices which are rather severely limited in voltage, 
power, and operating temperature characteristics. Some attempts have been made to rectify these 
shortcomings by fabricating lateral MOSFETs from silicon 
carbide, which is capable of withstanding a much larger 
breakdown voltage and has a better thermal conductivity. 
However, lateral MOSFETs have the disadvantage of requiring 
much larger die area for devices capable of performing at an 
equivalent level with vertical structures.  It is a purpose of the present invention to provide a 
relatively easy method of fabricating LOCOS vertical MOSFETs 
from silicon carbide. It is a further purpose of the present invention to 
provide a method of fabricating LOCOS vertical MOSFETs from 
silicon carbide without requiring difficult diffusion and/or 
implant steps. It is a further purpose of the present invention to 
provide a method of fabricating LOCOS vertical MOSFETs from 
silicon carbide without requiring difficult wet etch steps. The above described problems are substantially solved 
and the above described purposes are realized in a method of 
fabricating a silicon carbide LOCOS vertical MOSFET 
including the steps of providing a silicon carbide substrate 
of a first conductivity type and forming a first epitaxial 
layer of the first conductivity type on the surface of the 
substrate. The epitaxial layer is relatively lightly doped 
compared to the substrate. Forming a second epitaxial layer 
of a second conductivity type on the surface of the first 
epitaxial layer. Forming a relatively thin layer of the 
first conductivity type adjacent the surface of the second 
epitaxial layer and forming an opening in the relatively
