<ABSTRACT>
A thermoplastic polyurethane-urea obtainable by optionally stepwise reaction of     a) one or more polyisocyanates with b) one or more compounds containing on average at least 1.8 Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms and having a molecular weight of from 400 to 10000,   c) water and   d) optionally further conventional auxiliaries and additives, where the water is introduced into the reaction mixture with the aid of an effective amount of one or more emulsifiers.

Thermoplastic polyurethane urea obtainable by the
reaction, optionally stepwise, of


a) one or more polyisocyanates with
b) one or more compounds having on average at least
1.8 Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms and a

molecular weight of between 400 and 10,000,
c) water and
d) optionally further conventional auxiliary
substances and additives, with the exception of

diamines,

characterised in that the water together with an
effective quantity of one or more emulsifiers is

introduced into the reaction mixture at temperatures
of from 30°C to 110°C and the conversion to

polyurethane urea is carried out at temperatures of
from 50°C to 220°C.
Thermoplastic polyurethane urea according to claim 1,
characterised in that the emulsifier or optionally

mixture of emulsifiers is a polyoxyalkylene having at
least one hydroxyl group and a content of oxyethylene

units of at least 20 wt.%.
Thermoplastic polyurethane urea according to claims 1
and 2, characterised in that the equivalent ratio of

component b) to component c) is between 5:1 and 1:30. 
Thermoplastic polyurethane urea according to claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the ratio of the

isocyanate equivalents from component a) to the sum of
the equivalents of Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms

from component b) and component c) is in total less
than 1.1:1.
Process for the preparation of polyurethane ureas
according to claims 1 to 4 from


a) one or more polyisocyanates,
b) one or more compounds having on average at least
1.8 Zerewitinoff-active hydrogen atoms and a

molecular weight of between 400 and 10,000,
c) water and
d) optionally further conventional auxiliary
substances and additives, with the exception o
f
diamines,

characterised in that the water together with an
effective quantity of one or more emulsifiers is

introduced into the reaction mixture at temperatures
of from 30°C to 110°C and the conversion to

polyurethane urea is carried out at temperatures of
from 50°C to 220°C.
Process for the preparation of polyurethane ureas
according to claim 5, characterised in that


i) a prepolymer is prepared from at least portions
of component a) and at least portions of

component b) and 
ii) this prepolymer is reacted together with the rest
of the starting materials and the remaining

portions of components a) and b) to form
polyurethane urea.
Process for the batchwise preparation of polyurethane
ureas according to claims 5 and 6, characterised in

that the water constituting component c) together with
the emulsifier is introduced at temperatures of

between 30°C and 110°C into the reaction mixture
consisting of the rest of the starting materials, and

the conversion to polyurethane urea is carried out at
temperatures of between 50°C and 110°C.
Process for the preparation of polyurethane ureas
according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that the

conversion to polyurethane urea is carried out at
temperatures of between 50°C and 220°C in a multishaft

screw extruder optionally equipped with kneading
elements and with a self-cleaning screw geometry, with

the water together with the emulsifier being
introduced into the reaction mixture at temperatures

of between 30°C and 110°C.
Process for the preparation of polyurethane ureas
according to claim 8, characterised in that the water

together with the emulsifier is introduced into the
screw extruder behind the other starting materials,

viewed in the direction of delivery.
Use of the polyurethane ureas according to claims 1 to
4 for the preparation of moulded articles, mouldings

and injection-moulded parts, thermoformed parts, semifinished
goods, plates, containers, equipment parts,

housings, rolls, gearwheels, machine and vehicle 
parts, cylinders, elastic coatings, films, casings,

flexible tubing, catheters, seals, profiles, bearing
shells and fibres.
