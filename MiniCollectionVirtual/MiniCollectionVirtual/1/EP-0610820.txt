<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a poison-resistant catalytically 
active microporous membrane to be used for heterogeneously 

catalyzed reactions, which membrane is characterized in that it 
is permeable to one of the reactants separated by said membrane, 

and that it is impermeable to the other reactants and the 
contaminants contained therein, the molecules of all of which 

are larger in size than the pore size of the membrane, and to 
a process for carrying out a heterogeneously catalyzed reaction 

under conditions preventing the catalyst from being poisoned. 
This membrane allows to conduct three-phase reactions in a new 

manner, whereby the reaction gas is directly transported to the 
active sites.

<DESCRIPTION>
A major part of the entirety of chemical manufacturing
processes is based on heterogeneously catalyzed multiphase
reactions, where the catalyst is present in the solid state and
the reactants, mostly in the liquid or gaseous state, are passed
over the catalyst. In such a process the catalyst will be
deactivated (poisened) in the course of time. Such deactivation
or poisoning is mostly caused by undefined contaminants in the
liquid phase, which contaminants are deposited on the active
sites of the catalyst. Said contaminants often have a molecular
weight that is higher than that of the actual molecules of the
liquid, are often present only in minimum concentrations, while
with the lapse of time they become accumulated on the surface
of the catalyst thereby reducing the number of the accessible
catalytically active sites.The use of catalytically active membranes for improving
catalytic processes has already been investigated for some time.
Thus, palladium is suitable as a membrane for the selective
transportation of hydrogen, which property can be utilized for
hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions {N. Itoh, R. Govind,
Membrane Reactor Technology, AlChE Symposium Series 268 (1989)
85; V.M. Gryaznov, V.P. Polyaskova, E. Mikhailovich, E.V.
Krapova, US 4,026,958 (1977)}. The high membrane costs and the
relatively low permeation rate are supposed to be responsible
for that this simple reaction principle hitherto could not find
any significant practical application. Ceramic membranes that
are distinguished from organic membranes by their increased
mechanical strength and temperature resistance as well as
chemical resistance are potential materials for applications in
the field of gas separation and heterogeneous catalysis. Thus, 
it could be shown that, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of
methanol and butane upon the use of aluminum oxide membranes in
the presence of Pt catalysts and ZnO, hydrogen is selectively
removed from the reaction zone, so that the conversion and
selectivity were improved by a factor of 1.5 over membrane-free
reaction conditions {VT. Zaspalis, W. van Praag, K. Keizer,
J.G. van Ommen, J.R.H. Ross, A.J. Burggraaf, Appl. Catal. 74
(1991) 223 and 235}. One important problem inherent to the
presently available inorganic materials for membrane reactors
is constituted by the pore distribution thereof which, amounting
to from 4 nm (40 Å) to 5 µm, is much too large for molecular
sieving and an effective gas separation {S. Ilias, R. Govind,
JAlChE Symposium Series 268 (1989) 18; H.P. Hsieh,
