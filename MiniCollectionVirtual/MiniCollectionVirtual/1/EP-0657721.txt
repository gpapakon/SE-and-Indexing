<ABSTRACT>
In a length measuring device (1) according to Figure 1, a number of division tracks (3a, 3b) are provided on a material measure (3). The division track (3b) which, because the material measure (3) is attached to the support body (2) in the area B is only accessible at its surface, is scanned by a scanning device (4) by reflected light. The freely accessible area A of the material measure (3), in contrast, is scanned by transmitted light by the scanning device (4). A further division track (3c), which is also scanned by the scanning device (4), is provided on a further material measure (31).
