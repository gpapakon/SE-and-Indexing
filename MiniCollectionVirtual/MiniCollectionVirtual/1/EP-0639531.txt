<ABSTRACT>
A process for treating waste washing water, which is only slightly affected by the temperature and can dispense with any 
chemical and wherein the quality of treated water is not affected by a change in the waste water concentration. The process comprises 

conducting impregnation with an impregnant having a composition comprising triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, nonionic surfactant and azobisisobutyronitrile, separating the impregnant thereafter, 

washing the surface of an impregnated article with water, and treating the waste water with a liquid obtained by filtering the 
liquid having the above composition though a filter having a retained particle diameter of 20 µm or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the treatment of 
the effluent from the washing with water of an impregnated 
object, which method accomplishes the treatment without 
specially requiring addition of a chemical agent. The practice of using a liquid impregnant such as of 
sodium silicate or an unsaturated polyester or an aerophobic 
liquid impregnant for the purpose of infallibly sealing 
invisible pinholes in die-cast products and cast products of 
aluminum, zinc, and other metals, completely filling and 
sealing pores in sintered metal parts, preventing plated 
products from blowing by subjecting the parts to the treatment 
of impregnation before the step of plating, and sealing 
minute pores in such porous non-metallic parts such as of wood 
and ceramincs has been in vogue. For example, the impregnation of a given part is attained 
by defattyling and cleaning the part, subjecting the cleaned 
part to vacuum aspiration in a vacuum tank thereby removing 
entrapped air from the minute pores in the part, then immersing 
the part in a bath of an organic liquid impregnant such  
 
as an aerophobic resin, maintaining the past in a vacuum, 
and subsequently exposing the immersed part to the atmospheric 
pressure thereby causing the liquid impregnant to permeate 
the minute pores. In this case, the impregnation can be 
enhanced by supplying compressed air to the site of impregnation. 
Then, the liquid impregnant is returned to the reservior 
and the part which has undergone the impregnation is centrifuged 
to expel the liquid impregnant adhering to the surface of 
the part. Thereafter, the part is cleaned with a detergent 
to remove the liquid impregnant still remaining on the surface 
of the part or in the tapped holes. The treatment of impregnation 
is finished by subjecting the part to the treatment 
for curing. In this treatment of impregnation, the effluent to be 
discharged from the site of treatment is the spent detergent 
which occurs when the liquid impregnant remaining only 
slightly on the surface of the part which has undergone the 
treatment of impregnation is washed off with a detergent. 
Heretofore, such organic solvents as trichloroethane and 
fluorinated hydrocarbon have been used as detergents. On 
account of the anxiety about the environment and the concern 
about cost, the use of such organic detergents has been 
giving place to the use of water for the cleaning. In consequence 
of this trend, there has arisen the necessity for 
separating and recovering the liquid impregnant

<CLAIMS>
A method for the treatment of the effluent from 
the washing with water of an impregnated object produced 

by the treatment of impregnation using an organic impregnating 
agent having as a main component thereof an acrylic type 

or methacrylic type monomer containing at least 30% of a 
cross-linking agent or a water-insoluble monomer, which method 

is characterized by effecting said treatment of the effluent 
by the treatment of filtration using a filter medium having 

an average retained particle diameter of at lest 20 µm. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cross-linking 
agent is a water-insoluble cross-linking agent. 
The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
filter medium is any one selected from the group consisting 

of cellulose, tetrafluroethylene, polysulfone, aromatic 
polyamides, glass fiber, alumina and titanium dioxide.
