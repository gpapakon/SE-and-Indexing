<ABSTRACT>
Environmental contaminants such as ivermectins and chlorophenols are degraded by the use of a hydroperoxide and a metal catalyst. The metal catalyst may be a naturally-occurring complex such as a metalloprotein. The hydroperoxide may be generated in situ, e.g. by the oxidation of linoleic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BIOCATALYSIS Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a biocatalytic process and also to compositions for use in such processes. Background of the InventionMany complex molecules are found in nature that are toxic to humans and animals alike. Some in addition are manufactured by man to control pests and undesirable parasites. Examples of these naturally-occurring materials are the ergotamines in rye flour and the aflatoxins in maize; both can cause severe toxicological problems when consumed. Of the various synthetic types, many are related to naturally-occurring compounds. Many are also slow to be degraded in the environment. Classical amongst these latter, synthetic compounds are the avermectins, of which ivermectins have found wide application in the treatment of internal and external parasitic infections.Organic compounds in general, some naturally-occurring and others synthetic, are in general slow to degrade in the environment, especially those which are predominantly hydrocarbon or halohydrocarbon. Such compounds include aromatic compounds such as halogenated phenols, e.g. polychlorophenols such as tetra- and pentachlorophenol, permethrin, substituted benzenes, phenols, e.g. cresol, polynuclear compounds such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons and similar structures with a cyclic formation. There are also many such aliphatic compounds, including aliphatic alcohols and halogenated aliphatics, e.g. unsaturated halogenated aliphatics. Many applications have been reported where transition metals, either alone or complexed, have been used as relatively non-specific catalysts of oxidative reactions. In particular, haem, its derivatives and haem-containing enzymes (especially peroxidases) have proved very versatile. However, these reactions generally take place only under harsh conditions: in the presence of a strong oxidant, at high temperature, or both. 

 For example, US-Aâ€”4773966 describes the degradation of lignin model compounds using transition metal ions, but the reactions reguired the presence of persulphate and were carried out by refluxing in 83% acetic acid. O-A-8807988 describes the synthesis of a series of water-soluble tetraphenyl porphyrins which can oxidise lignin, lignin model compounds and kraft pulp, but again these reactions required the addition of a strong oxidant such as a peroxide, peracid or hypochlorite. Paszczynski et al. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 5 (1) , 62-68 (1988) , used hemin and a synthetic iron porphyrin to bleach kraft pulp, but the reactions required hydrogen
