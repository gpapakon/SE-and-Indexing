<ABSTRACT>
The wt. stack consists of several wt. plates stacked one above the other which are shape locking via three peripheral connecting elements. The connected wt. plates hang from load frames of the machine. Each connecting element is a head bolt attached to one wt. plate, whose head protrudes through a radially open slot in the other plate. An inner flat surface of its head rests against the end face of the other plate when lowered. The head bolts have reduced dia. central sections (12). A cylindrical surface (18) fits in the slot (11).

<CLAIMS>
Stack of weights for force check gauges with direct weight effect,
comprising several disc weights stacked one on top of the other (8,8', 8"),

which can be positively linked to the directly adjacent disc weights (8, 8',
8") in each case by three link elements (1) located around the

circumference of the disc when the appropriate lower disc weight (8, 8',
8") is lowered, where the linked disc weights (8, 8', 8") are attached to the

load frame (6) of the force check gauge and each link element (1) is a set
bolt (10) attached to one disc weight 8, the head (13) of said set bolt

protruding with axial clearance through a location opening of the
appropriate other disc weight (8), and which can rest against an internal

face (14) of its head (13) on an outside face (15) of this other disc weight
(8) when lowered, where the set bolt (10) comprises a centre section (12)

of reduced width compared with the width of the location opening and
where a tapered surface (16), acting as an aligning surface, is connected

to at least the head end of the centre section (12), characterised in that
the location openings for the set bolts (10) are radial location slits (11)

which are open to the disc circumference and that a cylindrical mating
surface (18) in each case, is connected to the tapered surface (16), which

fits into the location slit (11) with clearance. 
Stack of weights according to claim 1, characterised in that a cylindrical
mating surface (18, 19) is connected to the centre section (12) of the set

bolt (10) in both directions, in each case by a tapered surface (16, 17)
acting as an aligning face, said mating surface fitting into the location slit

(11) with clearance.
Stack of weights according to claim 1, characterised in that the set bolt
(10) has at its attachment end facing away from the head (13) a support

(20), the axial height of which is greater than the measure by which the set
bolt (10) protrudes beyond the disc weight, when the disc weight (8) is

lowered.
Stack of weights according to claim 1, characterised in that the set bolt
(10) is bolted to the disc weight (8) by means of a central attachment bolt

(21).
