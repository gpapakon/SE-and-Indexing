<ABSTRACT>
A device for forming an electrical connection between part of an elongate electrical conductor between its ends and one or more other electrical conductors comprises an electrically insulating sleeve, a metallic connecting element located within the sleeve, and a quantity of solder for forming a permanent electrical connection between the conductors. The electrically insulating sleeve and the connecting element have two open ends to allow the elongate electrical conductor to extend through them, and the connecting element has a tapering internal surface which has a screw thread to enable the other electrical conductor or conductors to be held in contact with the elongate electrical conductor by twisting the connecting element about the conductors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical connectors, and especially to connectors for 
forming solder joints between conductors in such articles as automotive harnesses and the 
like. Electrical harnesses, for example as manufactured in the automotive industry, are 
often quite complex. In some instances they are manufactured by forming two or more sub-assemblies 
of wires, terminals, connectors and any other components, and then forming 
electrical connection(s) between the sub-assemblies. In such a case the assembly of the 
harness may be controlled by computer permitting, with the aid of a monitor, the assembly 
operator to see schematically the lay up and to check correct build-up of the assembly at 
each stage of the harness manufacture. In order to enable this control process to operate the 
ends of the conductors of the sub-assemblies are connected, eg. by means of spring 
contacts, and an electrical current or signal is passed through the assembly in order to 
obtain verification that the harness is correct. It is only after such verification is obtained 
that the clips are removed and a permanent electrical connection is formed. US-A-4288657 discloses a twist-on connector for electric wires comprising a 
hollow plastic shell having an opening at one end and a generally perpendicular wall closing 
the other end. The inside surface of the shell is provided with a plurality of longitudinally 
inwardly extending ribs which function to funnel an insert spring which is threaded into the 
shell. The spring receives the stripped ends of the wires. EP-A-0536240 discloses a device for forming an electrical connection at the end of  
 
a bundle of wires, comprising a heat shrinkable sleeve, a metallic connecting element 
located within the sleeve, and a quantity of solder for forming a permanent electrical 
connection between the conductors. The connecting element has a tapering internal surface 
which has a screw thread so that a temporary electrical connection can be formed by 
screwing the bundle of wires into the connecting element. A device for forming temporary and a permanent electrical connection that is 
suitable in such a circumstance is also described in our co-pending international application 
No. PCT/GB91/01016. According to the present invention such a device is modified in 
order to enable electrical conductors to be connected to an intermediate part of an elongate 
conductor. Thus, in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a 
device for forming an electrical

<CLAIMS>
A device (1) for forming an electrical connection between an elongate electrical 
conductor(2) at a location (10) partway along its length between its ends and one or more 

other electrical conductors (11), which comprises; an electrically insulating sleeve (3), and 
a metallic connecting element (6) and a quantity of solder (7) located within the sleeve (3), 

wherein the sleeve (3) and the connecting element (6) are open at each of their ends (4, 5) 
such that the elongate conductor (2) can project from each end thereof, and wherein the 

connecting element (6) is formed by coiling a piece of wire into a tapering coil to provide a 
screw thread to enable the other electrical conductor or conductors (11) to be held in 

contact with the elongate conductor (2) by twisting the connection element (6) about the 
conductors (2, 11), and wherein the coil (6) has been radially expanded from its relaxed 

state and is held in a radially expanded state by the sleeve (3) and/or the solder (7), so that 
it will radially contract, or attempt radially to contract, when heat is applied to the device 

(1) to melt the solder (7) so as to form a permanent electrical solder connection between the 
conductors (2, 11). 
A device (1) according to claim 1, wherein the connecting element (6) tapers from a 
relatively large diameter at one of its open ends to a relatively small diameter at the other of 

its open ends. 
A device (1) according to claim 1, wherein the connecting element (6) tapers from a 
relatively large diameter at each of its open ends to a relatively narrow passage intermediate 

its length. 
A device (1) according to any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the insulating 

sleeve (3) is dimensionally heat-recoverable 
and the heat applied to the device effects 

its recovery around the conductors. 
A method of forming an electrical connection between an elongate electrical 
conductor (2) at a location (10) partway along its length between its ends and one or more 

other electrical conductors (11) which comprises :  

 

(a) sliding a connecting device (1) along the elongate electrical conductor (2) 
from one end thereof to the location (10) partway therealong; the connecting 

device being in accordance with any one of claims 1 to 4; 
(b) inserting the one or more other electrical conductors (11) into at least one 
end (4, 5) of the sleeve (3) and connecting element (6); 
(c) twisting the device (1) about the conductors (2, 11) so that the connecting 
element (6) holds the other conductor or conductors (11) in contact with the 

elongate electrical conductor (2); and 
(d) heating the device (1) (i) to allow the coil to contract, or to attempt to 
contract, radially on to the one or more electrical conductors, and (ii) to melt 

the solder (7) so as to form a permanent solder connection between the 
conductors (2, 11).
