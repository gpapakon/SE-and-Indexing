<ABSTRACT>
Container (59) composed, in particular, of a bottle (flask) (22) surrounded by a casing (23) which can slide in piping, particularly by pneumatic means. A composite element (33, 40) all in one piece is used to close simultaneously the openings of the bottle and of the casing by means of a screwing operation. These and other improvements make the container very attractive for numerous measurements carried out in shielded analysis cases for dangerous and particularly radioactive samples.

Receptacle (59) composed of an open flask (22) intended to 
contain a substance, a flexible stopper (40) closing the flask 

by means of a circular lip (42) moulded onto the opening of the 
flask and having a surface (41) pricked by a needle (60) in 

front of the opening of the flask, an open casing (23) surrounding 
the flask and intended to slide in a transport pipe (68), and an 

inner capsule (33) closing the casing, characterized in that the 
stopper (40) permanently embedded in the inner capsule (33), the 

latter being screwed to the casing and interrupted (39) in front 
of the pricking surface (41). 
Receptacle according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
flask (22) bears a small ring (25) placed on the opening of the 

casing and fixed (26) to the casing (23). 
Receptacle according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the inner capsule and either the flask or the casing bear a brake 

(31,32,36) for unscrewing the inner capsule. 
Receptacle according to claim 3, characterized in that the 
brake consists of a toothed crown (36) on the inner capsule and 

another toothed crown (31) on the flask or the casing, the teeth 
(32) of the crowns being imbricated. 
Receptacle according to any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the flask is plastic and is obtained by 

moulding. 
Receptacle according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
moulding is a moulding with an internal mould.
