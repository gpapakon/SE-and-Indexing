<ABSTRACT>
In a process for dyeing a substrate in a supercritical fluid, an additive-free dye is absorbed in the supercritical fluid and flows over and/or through the substrate to be dyed. A usual additive-containing dye is selected for dyeing and is separated into additives and additive-free dye before dyeing the substrate. The separated, additive-free dye is then directly absorbed in the supercritical fluid used for dyeing or in another liquid.

A method for the dyeing of a substrate in a supercritical 
fluid, whereby a dyestuff without additives is taken up in a 

supercritical fluid, and therewith the substrate to be dyed is 
flowed against and/or cross-flowed, characterized in that a 

conventional dyestuff containing additives is chosen, that 
before dyeing of the substrate the additives and the dyestuff 

without additives are separated and that the separated dyestuff 
without additives is taken up directly in the supercritical 

fluid used for the dyeing or in another liquid. 
The method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
dyestuff without additives is isolated after the separation of 

the additives and that then the isolated dyestuff is taken up 
in another liquid creating a dyestuff without additives 

formulated as a liquid. 
The method according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
dyestuff without additives is taken up in water, acetone, 

alcohol and/or in a chlorinated hydrocarbon creating thereby a 
liquid formulated dyestuff. 
The method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the conventional dyestuff is extracted to 

separate the additives from the dyestuff without additives.  
 
The method according to claim 4, characterized in that for 
the extraction such a liquid is chosen which solves the 

additives out of the conventional dyestuff. 
The method according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
additives are extracted out of said conventional dyestuff with 

a fluid being used for the dyeing of the substrate. 
The method according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
conventional dyestuff is extracted with such a fluid being used 

for the dyeing, that the additives in the fluid are removed out 
of the fluid, and that thereafter the dyeing with the dyestuff 

without additives is directly carried out. 
The method according to claim 7, characterized in that for 
the removal of the additives out of the fluid the fluid is led 

over an ad- and/or absorber. 
The method according to claim 7 or 8, characterized in that 
for the separation of the additives out of the fluid a 

variation of the temperature, the pressure and/or the volume is 
carried out. 
The method according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a fluid is chosen for the extraction 

solving the dyestuff without additives out of the conventional 
dyestuff.  

 
The method according to claim 10, characterized in that an 
organic solvent is used for the extraction of the conventional 

dyestuff, and that the organic solvent is evaporated after the 
extraction isolating thereby the dyestuff without additives 

extracted by the organic solvent. 
The method according to claim 10, characterized in that the 
conventional dyestuff is extracted with an organic solvent, and 

that after the extraction the dyestuff without additives solved 
in the organic solvent is ad- and/or absorbed on a ad- and/or 

absorber. 
The method according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the conventional dyestuff is extracted 

with a supercritical fluid. 
The method according to claim 13, characterized in that 
alkane, preferably ethane, propane or pentane, ammonia, 

fluorine-chlorine-alkane, carbon dioxide and/or carbon 
monooxide each separately or in a mixture are chosen as 

supercritical fluid. 
The method according to one of the claims 4 to 14, 
characterized in that a moderator is added to said fluid used 

for the extraction.  
 
The method according to claim 15, characterized in that 
polar compounds , particularly water, alcohols and/or salts are 

used as moderator. 
The method according to one of the claims 4 to 16, 
characterized in that the extraction is carried out at a 

temperature between 10 째C and 240 째C, preferably between 30 째C 
and 180 째C. 
The method according to one of the claims 4 to 17, 
characterized in that the conventional dyestuff is extracted 

with the fluid between 2 and 20 minutes, preferably between 5 
and 15 minutes. 
The method according to one of the claims 4 to 18, 
characterized in that after the extraction of the conventional 

dyestuff the additives containing in the extract or the 
dyestuff without additives containing in the extract are or is 

removed out of the extract by a phase separation, a liquid-liquid-extraction, 
an ad- and/or absorption and/or a 

filtration, and that then the fluid free of additives or free 
of dyestuff without additives is used again for the further 

extraction. 
The method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a disperse dyestuff is chosen as 

conventional dyestuff.  
 
The method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that a textile substrate, preferably a yarn, 

an embroidery yarn, a sewing thread, a textile fabric or a 
made-up piece of fabric, is dyed as a substrate . 
The method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the textile substrate contains or 

consists of polyester, polyamide, polyalkylene.
