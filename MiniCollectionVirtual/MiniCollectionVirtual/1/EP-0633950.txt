<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of copper-containing 
nickel-free phosphate coatings with a copper content of 

0.1 to 5.0% by weight and an edge length of the phosphate 
crystals of 0.5 to 10 µm on metal surfaces selected from 

steel, galvanized steel, alloy-galvanized steel, aluminium 
and alloys thereof by treatment of the surfaces by 

spraying, dipping or spraying/dipping with a phosphating 
solution containing the following components: 


zinc ions
0.2 to 2 g/l 
copper ions
0.5 to 25 mg/l 
phosphate ions
5 to 30 g/l (expressed as P₂O₅) 
 
and hydroxylamine salts, hydroxylamine complexes and/or 

hydroxylamine in a quantity of 500 to 5,000 ppm of 
hydroxylamine, based on the phosphating solution. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the phosphating solution contains up to 500 ppm of 

iron(II) ions and, more particularly, up to 50 ppm of 
iron(II) ions. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the phosphating solution contains 5 to 20 ppm of 

copper ions when applied by dipping and 1 to 10 ppm of 
copper ions when applied by spraying. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the phosphating solution additionally 

contains 0.1 to 5 g/l and, more particularly, 
0.5 to 1.5 g/l of manganese(II) ions. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the phosphating solution additionally 

contains alkaline earth metal cations, more 
particularly magnesium and/or calcium ions, in a quantity 

of up to 2.5 g/l. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the hydroxylamine salt is 

selected from hydroxylammonium phosphate, hydroxylammonium  
 

nitrate, hydroxylammonium sulfate or mixtures thereof. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the phosphating solution additionally 

contains an oxidizing agent selected from 
peroxide compounds, chlorates, permanganates and organic 

nitro compounds. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that a phosphating solution substantially 

free from nitrite ions is used. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
8, characterized in that a phosphating solution substantially 

free from nitrate ions is used. 
The use of the process claimed in one or more of 
claims 1 to 9 as a pretreatment of the metal surfaces 

before lacquering, more particularly before cataphoretic 
dip lacquering.
