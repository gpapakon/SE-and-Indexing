<ABSTRACT>
A variable capacity vane compressor has an axial 
pressure device for applying variable axial pressure to 

a rotary valve. The rotary valve plate locates in a 
rotary valve housing and changes the capacity of the 

compressor due to its rotary position. An actuator 
member rotates the rotary valve plate in response to 

varying pressure in the discharge and intake chambers. 
A control valve supplies a variable control pressure to 

the actuating member for moving the actuating member to 
rotate the rotary valve plate. An annular axial pressure 

chamber is located between the rotary valve housing and 
the rotary valve plate. A control pressure port leads 

from the control valve to the axial pressure chamber. A 
seal member within the axial pressure chamber applies an 

axial force on a bearing located on the rotary valve 
plate. The control valve which supplies variable 

pressure used to vary the actuator member position also 
supplies the control pressure to the axial pressure 

chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to variable
capacity vane compressors for air conditioning systems,
particularly for vehicles, and in particular to an
axial pressure device that enhances sealing between a
rotary valve plate and a compression housing shoulder.One type of automotive air conditioning compressor
in use is a variable capacity vane compressor. In this
type of compressor, a compression housing has a chamber
that is oval in shape. A cylindrical rotor extends
through the chamber. The rotor has radial vanes mounted
to it which slide radially in slots formed in the rotor.
Refrigerant at suction pressure enters the compression
chamber, with the vanes compressing the refrigerant,
which passes outward through a valve.The compressor demand varies according to speed and
atmosphere conditions. At highway speed, the demand is
usually lower than while idling on a hot day. To vary
the capacity, a rotary valve disk or plate mounts in
front of the compression housing and in engagement with
a shoulder on the compression housing. The valve plate
has a slotted perimeter which will change the position of
the opening from the intake chamber into the compression
chamber depending upon the rotational position of the
valve plate. The valve plate is rotatably carried in a
rotary valve housing, also known as a rear side block. 
The particular rotational position of the valve plate
will change the quantity of refrigerant introduced
between the vanes for compression by changing the timing
of the compression cycle.An actuator will rotate the valve plate to selected
positions depending upon the changes in the discharge
pressure and the intake or suction pressure. In one
type, such as shown in U.S. Patent 5,145,327, the
actuator member comprises radial projections mounted to
the rear side of the rotary valve plate and located
within chambers. Each projection serves as a piston.
Variable fluid pressure is applied to both sides of each
piston. Also, a spring will urge the plate to a minimum
delivery position.A control valve supplies a control pressure to one
side of each piston, the other side of each piston being
at intake pressure. The control valve includes a bellows
which has a stem that engages a ball valve. The bellows
is located in a portion of the suction chamber. A
plunger or bias pin on the opposite side of the ball has
one end exposed to discharge pressure. The plunger and
the stem of the bellows cooperate depending upon the
discharge and intake pressure to selectively apply a
control pressure to one side of the
