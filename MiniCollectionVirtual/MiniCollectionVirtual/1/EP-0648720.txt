<ABSTRACT>
Arsine and COS are removed consecutively or simultaneously by passing the 
hydrocarbon feed over an absorbent material comprising nickel deposited on 

a support material and wherein the nickel is present both as metallic 
nickel and as nickel oxide, the total weight of nickel and nickel oxide 

representing up to about 80% of the weight of the absorbent, the weight 
ratio of metallic nickel to nickel oxide being of from 0.4 to 2.0, with the 

proviso that metallic nickel should represent neither less than 10 wt% nor 
more than 50 wt% of the absorbent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the consecutive removal of 
arsine and carbonyl sulphide (COS) from light olefin-containing hydrocarbon 
feedstocks, more particularly from propylene feedstocks. Industrial applications of light olefin-containing hydrocarbons, and 
particularly liquified propylene, have become more increasingly 
specialised. The present technology uses highly efficient catalysts to 
convert these hydrocarbon feedstocks into final products such as polymers. 
However, those highly efficient catalysts are very sensitive to 
contaminants, particularly COS and arsine, found in said hydrocarbons. The presence of COS or arsine, even at very low concentrations, oftentimes 
renders olefins, particularly propylene, valueless for many purposes. For 
example, high purity olefins are required for the satisfactory production 
of many polymeric products, especially those useful as plastics, including 
polymers of propylene. However, COS and arsine appear to be able to cause 
deactivation of the catalysts required for the polymerization . As a 
result, there is a real need to provide and improve techniques for removing 
COS and/or arsine from light olefin-containing hydrocarbons, particularly 
from those used for polymer production.  
 The purification of propylene is particularly complicated by the small 
difference between the boiling points of propylene, COS and arsine, which 
prevents the use of fractionation. Belgian Patent 902 942 discloses a process for the removal of COS from 
liquid hydrocarbon feedstocks containing propylene and up to 70 ppm COS, by 
passing it through an absorbent consisting of nickel deposited on a 
support, the nickel being present both as metal and as oxide, the amount of 
nickel present as metal being comprised between 35 and 70 wt% of the total 
amount of nickel. European Patent 448 698 discloses that the capacity of the absorbent 
disclosed in Belgian Patent 902 942 to remove COS from liquid hydrocarbons 
could be increased by a heat treatment between 150 and 450°C under a flow 
of non-oxidising gas. European Patent 308 569 discloses a process for the removal of arsine from 
light olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstocks, by passing it through an 
absorbent consisting of nickel deposited on a support, the nickel being 
present both as metal and as oxide, metallic nickel representing 10 to 50 
wt.% of the absorbent. In accordance with the present invention, arsine and COS are removed 
consecutively by passing the hydrocarbon feed over an 
absorbent material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for removing a first impurity selected from arsine 
and COS from a light olefin-containing hydrocarbon feedstock, 

said process comprising the steps of 

a) passing said feedstock over an absorbent material 
comprising nickel deposited on a support material wherein 

said nickel is present as both nickel oxide and metallic 
nickel, said material having previously been saturated 

with a second different impurity selected from arsine and 
COS; and 
b) recovering a hydrocarbon stream having a substantially 
reduced content in said first impurity. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the total weight of said nickel 
oxide and metallic nickel represent up to 80 wt.% of the 

absorbent material, the weight ratio of metallic nickel to 
nickel oxide being of from 0.4 to 2.0 with the provision that 

metallic nickel does not represent less than 10 wt.% nor more 
than 50 wt.% of the absorbent. 
The process of Claim 2 wherein the absorbent comprises from 30 
to 60 wt.% of support material. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 3 wherein said absorbent 
material has a specific surface area of at least 100 m

/g. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein the feedstock 
comprises more than 75% by weight of propylene, preferably from 

85 to 99 wt.% of propylene. 
The process of Claim 5 carried out at a temperature of from 
-10°C to 80°C, at a sufficient pressure to retain the feedstock 

in liquid phase, and a WHSV of from 0.1 to 25 kg/kg.h.  
 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein the feedstock 
comprises more than 80 wt.% of ethylene, preferably from 90 to 

99 %. 
The process of claims 7 carried out at a temperature of from 
-10°C to 80°C, at a pressure of at least 1 MPa, and at a WHSV 

of from 0.1 to 25 kg/kg.h. 
The process of either one of Claims 6 or 8 carried out at a 
temperature of from 10°C to 40°C and at a WHSV of from 1 to 10 

kg/kg.h. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 9 wherein the absorbent 
material is previously conditioned by passing a flow of inert 

gas containing a minor amount of at least one light olefin. 
The process of Claim 10 wherein said light olefin in said inert 
gas is propylene in a concentration of from 0.1 to 5 vol %. 
The process of either one of Claims 10 or 11 wherein the 
absorbent material is pretreated prior to its conditioning by 

passing therethrough, at a temperature of 150 to 250°C and 
preferably under atmospheric pressure, a gaseous flow 

comprising first an inert gas, then a mixture of inert gas and 

hydrogen containing an increasing hydrogen concentration.
