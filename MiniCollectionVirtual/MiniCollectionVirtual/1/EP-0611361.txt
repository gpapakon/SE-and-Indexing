A collecting vessel for reusable waste materials, such 
as in particular old glass, comprising sub vessels (1,2,3), 

which with the exception of the top inlet orifices (7) have 
enclosed outer, top and bottom faces (4,5,6) and at least 

one inner open face (8,11) facing in the closed position 
another sub vessel and which have linkages (14) connecting 

them together on their top faces (6) as well as coupling 
links (17) for lifting gear equipped with cooperating 

coupling links spaced at a distance in each case facing away 
from the linkage axes towards the hinged face of the other 

sub vessel, via which they can be pivoted open with their 
inner open face pivoted away from the other sub vessel in 

forming an emptying gap open at the bottom,
 
characterised in that the sub vessels (1,2,3) are arranged 

by their top face linkages (14) to a central receiving body 
(15), which has wall sections (21) sealing the inner open 

faces (8, 11) of the sub vessels (1,2,3) in their respective 
closed position. 
A collecting vessel according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that it generally has a substantially 

cubic form and features three or four sub vessels (1,2,3) 
the separation joints (22) of which run in the longitudinal 

and transverse plane of the substantially cubic main body in 
the closed position, so that the receiving body (15) at the 

intersection of the separation joints (22) is arranged. 
A collecting vessel according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that the axes of the linkages (14) between 

the top faces (6) of the sub vessels (1,2,3) and the 
receiving body (15) are arranged parallel and/or diagonal to 

the separation joints (22) and are arranged outside the 
vertical centre of the respective sub vessel (1,2,3) facing  

 
towards the central receiving body (15). 
A collecting vessel according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that the open face (11) of the sub vessel 

(2,3) extends over the inner corner edge of the respective 
sub vessel (2,3) for the diagonal arrangement of the axes of 

the linkages (14). 
A collecting vessel according to any of the claims 1 to 
4,
 
characterised in that the receiving body (15) has a central 

column (19), from which partitioning fins (20) project 
radially, which form at least one part of the wall sections 

(21) sealing the open faces (8,11) of the sub vessel 
(1,2,3). 
A collecting vessel according to claim 5,
 
characterised in that the column (19) of the receiving body 

(15) extends over the entire height of the sub vessels 
(1,2,3) in the top face (6) and the bottom face (5) of which 

negative contours (23,24) are impressed for encasement 
sealing of the column (19). 
A collecting vessel according to any of the claims 1 to 
6,
 
characterised in that on the open faces (8,11) of the sub 

vessels (1,2,3) the emptying orifices (9, 12) are arranged 
against laterally demarcating wall partitions (10, 13), which 

are overlapped by the wall partitions (21) or the 
partitioning fins (20) of the receiving body in the closed 

position. 
A collecting vessel according to any of the claims 5 to 
7,
 
characterised in that the receiving body (15) has a head  

 
plate (16) at the top end of its column (19) projecting 

radially thereover, along the edges of which the linkages 
(14) are arranged for the sub vessels (1,2,3). 
A collecting vessel according to any of the claims 1 to 
8,
 
characterised in that on the top end of the receiving body 

(15) is arranged a coupling device (18) for a load carrying 
link (26) of the lifting gear (25). 
A collecting vessel according to claim 9,
 
characterised in that the coupling device (18) is arranged 

on the top face of the head plate (16) of the receiving body 
(15). 
A collecting vessel according to claim 9 or 10,
 
characterised in that the coupling device (18) of the 

receiving body (15) and the load carrying link (26) of the 
lifting gear (25) can interlock with the coupling links (17) 

on the top face of the sub vessels (1,2,3) by means of form 
interlocking contours during engagement of the cooperating 

coupling links (32) of the lifting gear (25) and can detach 
from each other during disengagement. 
A collecting vessel according to claim 11,
 
characterised in that the coupling device (18) of the 

receiving body (15) has a long engagement slot (28) having 
an undercut (29) and the load carrying link (26) has a 

matching form engaging interlockable hammer head (27), 
whereby the lifting gear (25) is rotatable around a vertical 

axis passing through the hammer head (27). 
A collecting vessel according to claim 12,
 
characterised in that the coupling device (18) of the 

receiving head (15) on its underside in the region of the  
 

undercut has an open underside transverse groove (30) 
vertical to the longitudinal direction of the engagement 

slot (28). 
A collecting vessel according to claim 13,
 
characterised in that the undercut (29) extends at both ends 

on the underside of the coupling device (18) from the 
longitudinal direction of the engagement slot (28) over an 

angle of rotation for the hammer head (27) of the lifting 
gear (25) by 90Â° and is restricted by a downwards extending 

flank (31) of the transverse groove (30) as a stop for the 
hammer head (27). 
A collecting vessel according to any of the claims 11 
to 14,
 
characterised in that the counter coupling links (32) of the 

lifting gear (25) are in a vertical plane in each case 
between an outer spread position and a position drawn in 

towards the load carrying link (26) of pivotal hooks, which 
are fitted on the lifting gear (25) around the load carrying 

link (27) at the angular pitch of the coupling links (17) on 
the top face of the sub vessels (1,2,3) for projecting 

essentially downwards and having hook projections facing 
away in towards the load carrying link (17). 
A collecting vessel according to claim 15,
 
characterised in that the coupling links (17) are hook 

eyelets on the top face of the sub vessels (1,2,3) matched 
to the hook shaped counter coupling link (32) of the lifting 

gear (25).
