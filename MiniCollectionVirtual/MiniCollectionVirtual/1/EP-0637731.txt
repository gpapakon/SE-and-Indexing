<ABSTRACT>
Relationships of correspondence between data on a 
multiplicity of kinds of color and data on tristimulus 

values are determined in advance, and correspondence between 
interpolating points between inputted color data and data on 

the tristimulus values corresponding to the interpolation 
points is determined by interpolation on the basis of the 

determined relationships of correspondence. When a desired 
color is to be reproduced and outputted, tristimulus values 

which are identical to or closest to the tristimulus values, 
i.e., output values corresponding to that desired color, are 

selected, and color data corresponding to the selected 
tristimulus values is determined to reproduce the color.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of color
reproduction. More particularly, the
present invention concerns a method of color reproduction by
determining in advance correlations between input values and
an outputted color for reproducing a specific color in an
apparatus for color printing, color display, or the like.As is known, the color of an object surface, a color
original image, or the like can be specified in a
standardized manner by determining the position where
chromaticity coordinates, which are expressed by using
tristimulus values X, Y, and Z of the color in the CIE
(International Commission on Illumination) standard XYZ 
colorimetric system, are located in a chromaticity diagram.
Namely, if the spectral distribution I(λ) of light reflected
from or transmitted through the object or the like can be
measured, the tristimulus values X, Y, and Z can be
determined from the following Formula (1):

   where
k = 100· ∫ {I(λ)y(λ)dλ},x(λ), y(λ), z(λ): CIE color matching functions,λ: wavelengthThis value Y shows the brightness of the light having
I(λ), and the color can be specified by plotting points on a
chromaticity diagram of an orthogonal coordinate system, in
which values of x and y obtained from the following Formulae
(2) are set as chromaticity coordinates, and x is plotted as
the abscissa and y as the ordinate in a conventionally known
manner (all the colors are included within a slanted bell
shape):
x = X/(X + Y + Z)y = Y/(X + Y + Z)Recently, there has been a need for reproduction of
colors which can be specified in a standardized manner as
described above. For instance, in the field of design,
there has been a demand for color-reproducing techniques
which make it possible to faithfully reproduce necessary
colors for the purpose of evaluation of color design. As
examples of apparatus which require color reproduction of
color original images, there are display units for
displaying color-reproduced images that are color-reproduced
on the basis of color data on color original images, as well
as color copying apparatus (color hard-copying apparatus)
for copying color-reproduced images that are color-reproduced
on the basis of color data on color original
images.As a method of color reproduction during color hard
copying in the color hard-copy apparatus, a method of color
reproduction is known for faithfully reproducing a necessary
color by using image processing (Kodera: "Image Processing
for Color Reproduction" in Supplementary Volume "Imaging
Part 1" of the Shashin Kogyo (Photo Industry)

<CLAIMS>
A method of color reproduction comprising the steps of:

(a) determining a plurality of predetermined
relationships of correspondence between first values

expressed in a predetermined colorimetric system for
outputting a predetermined number of colors and second values

expressed in a colorimetric system, which is
different from the predetermined colorimetric system, for

specifying a color to be reproduced, and estimating a
plurality of interpolating points as estimated second values other than predetermined

second values;
(b) calculating by performing interpolation on the basis
of said plurality of predetermined relationships the first

values corresponding to the estimated second values;
(c) when an arbitrary color is to be reproduced,
selecting the second values which are identical to or closest

to the second values of the arbitrary color from the
estimated second values, and selecting the first values

corresponding to the identical or closest second values; and
(d) reproducing the color on the basis of the selected
first values.
A method of color reproduction according to claim 1,
wherein the plurality of relationships of correspondence are

nonlinear relationships.
A method of color reproduction according to claim 1,
wherein the predetermined colorimetric system is an RGB

colorimetric system, and the different colorimetric system is 
an XYZ colorimetric system, and wherein the first values are

data on at least one of a color material and a bright
material, and the second values are tristimulus values.
