<ABSTRACT>
In order to develop a laser cutting device in a simple manner with regard to an improved work result, for example in respect of the edge quality achievable, the minimising of burr and the saving of rework, it is proposed to arrange a gas-mixing device (5) upstream of a conventional cutting head (1) which is provided with a nozzle chamber (3) for directing a gas. The output line (6) of the gas-mixing device (5) is connected to the cutting head (1). The gas-mixing device (5) is provided with an inlet line (7) carrying the main gas, for example N2, and further inlet lines (8, 9, 10) which serve to carry auxiliary gases which, either individually or in combination, can be added in a defined manner to the main gas flow flowing via the inlet line (7), so that a gas mixture of defined composition always flows via the outlet line (6) in the direction of the cutting head (1). To mix the auxiliary gases, each inlet line (8, 9, 10) has an injector nozzle (14, 14', 14'') allocated to it, the cross-section of flow of which is adjustable and which is connected on the outlet side to a line element which directs the main gas flow.
