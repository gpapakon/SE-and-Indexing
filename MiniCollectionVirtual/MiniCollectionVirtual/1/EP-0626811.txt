<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for producing reduced fat (oil-depleted) nuts of a controlled and preferably increased volume by the use of microwave heating. The term "nuts" as used herein refers to edible whole or half kernels of nuts such as hazelnuts, peanuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, pecans, walnuts and the like. The described process for producing reduced fat nuts comprising pressing the nuts to remove a proportion of the oil therein, exposing the oil-depleted nuts to moisture to hydrate them to a desired degree, drying the hydrated nuts to dry them to a desired degree, and then optionally roasting them, wherein at least part of the drying and/or of the roasting when carried out is effected using microwave radiation. Preferably the oil-depleted nuts are hydrated by subjecting them to steam, especially at a pressure of from 0.5 to 5.0 bars for from 0.5 to 5.0 minutes at a temperature of from 90 to 150 DEG C. The nuts produced by the process of this invention have good sensory properties and are essentially free from contamination by bacteria, yeasts and moulds.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing reduced fat (oil-depleted) nuts of a 
controlled and preferably increased volume by the use of microwave heating. The term "nuts" as used herein refers to edible whole or half kernels of nuts such as 
hazelnuts, peanuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, pecans, walnuts and the like. For 
conciseness the following description will refer principally to the production of 
reduced fat whole hazelnuts. The principles of this invention are, however, equally 
applicable to other nuts as aforesaid. In the following description percentages are percentages by weight unless indicated 
to the contrary. The basic procedures for preparing reduced fat nuts for foodstuffs are well known. 
These involve the following major steps; pressing the nuts until the desired quantity 
of oil is removed, applying heated water or steam to the pressed nuts until they are 
restored towards their original size and shape, and then drying them to the required 
moisture content. The dried nuts may then be roasted, if desired. These steps are 
well described for peanuts in US-A- 3,294,549 to Vix et al who state that the 
resulting low fat, high protein peanuts have excellent flavour, texture and appearance, 
as well as good shelf life. Unfortunately such reduced fat nuts tend to be smaller than the original nuts from 
which they were made and also tend to have inferior sensory qualities. In fact, 
following on from the disclosure by Vix et al, patents on reduced fat nuts have 
mainly concentrated on methods of improving their flavour. US-A-3,645,752 and 
US-A-3,740,336 to Baxley, US-A-4,049,833 to Gannis et al and GB-B-2,085,277 to 
Holloway and Wilkins are examples of such later patents. Thus the issue of size has 
been given little attention.  
 The present invention seeks to provide a process capable of producing reduced fat 
nuts of a controlled, and preferably larger, size than those obtainable by conventional 
production methods. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for producing 
reduced fat nuts comprising pressing the nuts to remove a proportion of the oil 
therein, exposing the oil-depleted nuts to moisture to hydrate them to a desired 
degree, drying the hydrated nuts to a desired degree, and then optionally roasting 
them, wherein at least part of the drying and/or of the roasting when carried out is 
effected using microwave radiation. The present invention discloses a method which enables larger reduced fat nuts of all 
varieties to be made. The nuts can

A process for producing reduced fat nuts comprising pressing the nuts to 
remove a proportion of the oil therein, exposing the oil-depleted nuts to moisture to 

hydrate them to a desired degree, drying the hydrated nuts to dry them to a desired 
degree, and then optionally roasting them, wherein at least part of the drying and/or 

of the roasting when carried out is effected using microwave radiation. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the oil-depleted nuts are hydrated by 
subjecting them to steam. 
A process as claimed in claim 2 wherein the nuts are subjected to steam at a 
pressure of from 0.5 to 5.0 bars for from 0.5 to 5.0 minutes at a temperature of from 

90 to 150Â°C. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the hydration step 
includes the application to the moistened nuts of a vacuum of up to 0.01 bar for up 

to 5 minutes. 
A process as claimed in claim 4 wherein a vacuum of 0.06 bar for 120 
seconds is applied. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the oil-depleted 
nuts are hydrated to a moisture content of from 10 to 20% by weight. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the hydrated 
nuts are dried by subjecting them to microwave radiation at from 250 to 5,000 watts 

for a period of from 0.5 to 5.0 minutes. 
A process as claimed in claim 7 wherein the hydrated nuts are dried to a 
moisture content of about 6% by weight.  

 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the nuts are 
pressed to remove from 20 to 90% by weight of the oil which is originally present. 
A process as claimed in claim 9 wherein from 50 to 75% by weight of the oil 
originally present is removed. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein prior to 
pressing the nuts are pre-dried to a moisture content of from 3 to 8% by weight. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims including the step of 
blanching the oil-depleted nuts to remove their skins prior to hydration. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
microwave roasting is carried out at between 700 and 3,000 watts until the moisture 

content of the roasted nuts is about 1.5% by weight. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the reduced 
fat, dried nuts are coated with at least one flavouring agent, condiment, texturiser or 

binder.
