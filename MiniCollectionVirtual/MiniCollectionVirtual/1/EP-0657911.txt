<ABSTRACT>
Saddle-shaped, flared deflection coil for display tubes, having two arcuate 
connection portions at the ends and two interposed coil flanks located at both sides of a 

window. The coil is wound by making use of two wire bundles which are 
simultaneously fed (by means of two winding arms or flyers). At certain instants during 

the winding process, the flyers can be moved apart in such a way that a pin can be 
inserted between the wire bundles. The result is a coil having (triangular) apertures in 

the flank portions in which one wire bundle extends along one side of each aperture and 
the other wire bundle extends along another side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a saddle-shaped deflection coil which flares out
from a rear end towards a front end and is of the type having an arcuate connection
portion at the front end, an arcuate portion at the rear end, and two interposed coil
flanks longitudinally extending at both sides of a window, see for example EP-A-0 436 998. A customary method of
manufacturing such a coil comprises the steps of:
a. providing a jig having a recessed winding space formed between two jig
sections, which space has a shape which corresponds to the desired shape of the
coil, for taking up continuously fed winding wire; and b. continuously feeding winding wire to the recess for forming a plurality of coil
turns. Generally, the longitudinal turns of the coil are spread over a plurality of
sections, each turn of a section surrounding the turns of the previous sections
and each pair of adjacent sections being separated over a part of its length by at
least one aperture which is formed in that a pin is inserted into the winding
space at at least two locations at both sides of the coil window along the
boundary between the two sections after the number of turns desired for the
first of these two sections has been provided, whereafter the second section is
wound around these pins. It is conventional practice to combine a set of saddle-shaped line
deflection coils with a set of saddle-shaped field deflection coils or a set of field
deflection coils toroidally wound on a core to form an electromagnetic deflection unit.
The nominal design of the coils may be such that, for example, certain requirements
with respect to the geometry of a raster scanned by means of the deflection unit on the
display screen of a display tube and/or with respect to the convergence of the electron
beams on the display screen are satisfied.In the above-mentioned method, the properties of the coil may be
influenced by determining the location of the open spaces during design and choosing
the number of turns per section during winding. In many cases this provides the
possibility of adapting the wire distribution and hence the distribution of the magnetic 
flux generated by the coil to the imposed requirements. It has recently become desirable
to wind saddle coils with a pluralitv of (parallel) wires simultaneously (referred to as
multiwire winding) instead of with one wire, see for example EP-A-0 572 192. In this way deflection coils are obtained
which can be used at higher (line) frequencies. For use at (line) frequencies of 32 kHz
or more, the copper
