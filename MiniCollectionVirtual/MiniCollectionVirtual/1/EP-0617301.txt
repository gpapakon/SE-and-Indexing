<ABSTRACT>
An optical waveguide having a small propagation loss 
and formed on an Si substrate having a large diameter has a 

lower cladding layer, a core and an upper cladding layer 
surrounding the core together with the lower cladding layer, 

each of the lower cladding layer, core and upper cladding 
layer being composed of a high-silica material. The upper 

cladding layer or each of the upper and lower cladding 
layers comprises three kind of dopants including germanium 

oxide (GeO₂), phosphorus oxide (P₂O₅) and boron oxide 
(B₂O₃). Preferable amount of content of GeO₂ in the upper 

cladding layer is more than 5 mole percent. The optical 
waveguide is suitable for a hybrid optical device including 

a functional device such as a semiconductor laser provided 
with metal patterns for electrodes and interconnections. 

The metal pattern can be formed before a thermal treatment 
of the upper cladding layer without causing a deficiency in 

the metal pattern during the thermal treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
waveguide composed of a high-silica material.In these days, advanced multi-functional optical
systems are demanded with the increase of the capacity of
the optical communication system. There are also a demand
for lowering costs of optical fiber networks. Optical
waveguides are a requisite for miniaturization, higher
integration and low cost production of optical devices,
hence various studies have been carried out on hybrid
functional devices in which a semiconductor laser, a
semiconductor photo detector etc. are mounted on a substrate
together with optical waveguides, as well as on devices
composed of optical waveguides only, such as an array of
couplers, switches, filters and modulators. A specific
structure of a hybrid optical device has been proposed, for
example, in a literature presented by Henry et al.,
"Lightwave Technology", IEEE, pp. 1530-1539, 1989. An optical waveguide composed of a high-silica
material (or silica-based material) and formed on an Si
substrate generally comprises three layers including a lower
cladding layer, a core, and an upper cladding layer. In
order to obtain an optical waveguide having a propagation
loss sufficiently small in a practical optical communication
system, each cladding layer should have a thickness more
than about 10 µm. The core also should have a thickness
more than about 5 µm in an optical device to obtain an
efficient coupling with an optical fiber in the wave band
for the optical communication system. Accordingly, at least
about 25µm is required for the total thickness of the three
layers for obtaining an optical waveguide having a
propagation loss sufficiently small in the practical optical
communication system.Fig. 1 shows a cross section of a conventional
optical waveguide formed on an Si substrate 1 by a flame
hydrolysis deposition using a chloride gas or CVD method
using a silane gas or chloride gas for depositing a high-silica
material. In flame hydrolysis deposition, undoped
silica is used for a cladding 7, and a high-silica material
is used for a core 8 in which a single dopant of germanium
oxide (GeO2) or titanium oxide (TiO2) is introduced, or in
which both phosphorus oxide (P2O5) and boron oxide (B2O3)
are introduced. In case of flame hydrolysis deposition, silica 
is made transparent by a thermal treatment at a temperature
about 1500°C after silica powder has been deposited on the
substrate 1. In this thermal treatment, however, cracks are
likely to be generated in the high-silica layer due to
