<ABSTRACT>
In the case of fibre-optic amplifiers, various parameters are measured, for example the input power, in order to make assessments regarding the operating mode of the transmission link and of the fibre-optic amplifier itself. In known fibre-optic amplifiers, a part of the input power is extracted through a coupler (2) for this purpose. In the case of transmission of optical signals at low power, such as for example in the case of digital signals, the extracted part of the input power can be detected only with high expense. In the fibre-optical amplifier according to the invention, the radiation produced by the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is extracted and evaluated in order to monitor the pump power and input power. Assessments can thereby be made regarding the state of the input signal.

<CLAIMS>
A fiber-optic amplifier for amplifying an optical 
signal, comprising a four-port coupler (2),
characterized in
 that for the reception 
of light in the wavelength region of the optical signal, 

an optical-to-electrical transducer (4) is provided 
which is connected to a port (A3) of the coupler (2) 

from which emerges a portion of the light which 
propagates in the fiber-optic amplifier in a direction 

opposite to that of the optical signal. 
A fiber-optic amplifier for amplifying an optical 
signal, comprising a four-port coupler (2) and a first 

optical-to-electrical transducer (9) which is connected 
to a port of the coupler (2) from which a portion of the 

optical signal emerges,
characterized in
 that for the reception 
of light in the wavelength region of the optical signal, 

a second optical-to-electrical transducer (4) is 
provided which is connected to a port (A3) of the 

coupler (2) from which emerges a portion of the light 
which propagates in the fiber-optic amplifier in a 

direction opposite to that of the optical signal 
(Fig. 1).  

 
A fiber-optic amplifier as claimed in claim 2,
 
characterized in that an evaluating device is provided 

which indicates a fiber break if the first and second 
optical-to-electrical transducers (9, 4) provide an 

electrical signal greater than a threshold value.
