<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metering device for liquid 
with medicinal application, for instance for dosing liquid 

food, intravenous liquids and the like, comprising a 
coupling piece which can be coupled to the drain opening of a 

liquid container, wherein an outflow aperture for liquid and 
a feed aperture for gas are arranged mutually separated in 

the coupling piece. The feed aperture for gas of the metering 
device is preferably provided with a valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a metering device for
liquid with medicinal application, for instance for
dosing liquid food, intravenous liquids and the like,
comprising a coupling piece which can be coupled to the
drain opening of a liquid container, wherein an outflow
aperture for liquid and a feed aperture for gas are
arranged mutually separated in the coupling piece and
wherein the feed aperture for gas is provided with a
valve.A metering device of the above stated type is
known from US-A-2 455 645. Via a valve in the feed aperture
for gas it is possible to supply gas to the liquid
container at the moment that the pressure in the liquid
container falls below a determined minimum value. A
drawback to this metering device, particularly in the
case liquid is administered intermittently, is that the
liquid for dosing generally dries up in the vicinity of
the valve as the aperture of the valve is in contact with
the liquid in the container. Referred to here for instance
is the administering at intervals of food and intravenous
liquids. The liquid food can dry up in the vicinity
of the valve whereby a good operation of the valve is
obstructed and the flow of administered liquid decreases.
Another drawback of the described device is possible
occurrence of gas bubbles in the liquid for dosing.The present invention has for its object to
provide an improved device of the described type wherein
the drawbacks of drying of liquid in the vicinity of the
valve and the occurrence of gas bubbles in the liquid are
limited.The invention provides for this purpose a
metering device wherein the valve aperture is enclosed by an
air pocket formed by a screening cover and being in communication
with the liquid via an orifice which is arranged in the wall
of said cover and is smaller in size than said outflow aperture.
Thus is achieved that the valve of the feed aperture for
gas is wholly separated from the liquid whereby blockage
and contamination thereof by drying of the liquid is 
prevented. The relatively small orifice in the
wall of the cover forms a barrier against liquid flowing
to the valve. The relatively small orifice has the additional
advantage that no large gas bubbles will be formed
in the liquid.The relatively small orifice is preferably
arranged in a side wall of the cover. In this way the
danger is reduced of the relatively small orifice becoming
blocked or dirtied during attachment of the metering
device to a liquid container.The side of the cover facing toward the liquid
container is preferably provided with an
