<ABSTRACT>
Live, attenuated Delaware infectious bursal disease viruses are screened for effectiveness by a monoclonal antibody specific for said Delaware strain. Those which are not bound by the antibody are not or may not be as effective in conferring protection against homologous wild type infectious bursal disease infection. Currently available live, attenuated vaccines do not include a virus having the binding site specified. A monoclonal antibody specific for the Delaware strain also provides a vaccine for passive immunization.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionAttenuated, Live Vaccine for Delaware Strain IBDVTechnical FieldThe invention pertains to a vaccine prepared from a live, but attenuated virus of the Delaware strain inducing infectious bursal disease in chickens. Specifically, a vaccine is prepared by screening potential attenuated virus candidates with a non-neutralizing specific monoclonal antibody. Further, a highly specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody is provided as an alternative, effective vaccine.Background ArtIn the inventors' related applications, including U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/423,752, entitled MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES FOR INFECTIOUS BURSAL DISEASE, VACCINES AND ASSAYS FOR USE THEREWITH, which in turn is a CIP application of U.S. Application Serial No. 07/061,083, now U.S. Patent 4,956,452 and U.S. Application Serial No. 07/227,311, now U.S. Patent 5,064,464 the development and study of a large number of monoclonal antibodies (Mab) specific for various strains of infectious bursal disease is discussed. As related in the above-cited U.S. Application Serial No. 07/423,752, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference, a panel of antibodies has been developed, each specific to a particular type of infectious bursal disease virus. That virus has been, by means of antibody assays, categorized into three separate classifications, classic, Delaware and GLS. At the time of filing of this application, the Delaware strain, of all pure strains, appears to be the dominant infectious bursal disease virus in the Eastern United States. Certainly, it is a substantial and continuing threat to the U.S. poultry industry.Wild-type Delaware IBDV have been known for some time, 

and are commercially available. There are a number of vaccines for this Delaware-type IBDV commercially available, including both "killed" and "live" vaccines. A killed vaccine is prepared by culturing the virus itself, in e.g., chicken eggs and the like, and subsequently "killing" the virus by heat, chemical treatment and the like. In a live vaccine, the virus is present in a living form, but has been attenuated to reduce or eliminate its virulency, by serial passage through cell culturing and the like. Thus, the "virus" component of a live vaccine is attenuated. Methods for preparation thereof are known in the art, and do not constitute, per se, an aspect of this invention. No currently available vaccine for wild-type Delaware IBDV is based on or comprises a non-virus active element, such as a monoclonal antibody.During the analysis and

2. The virus of Claim 1, wherein a monoclonal antibody having the binding characteristics of the antibody expressed by HB-10157 will bind.
3. A vaccine, comprising the live, attenuated virus of Claim 1, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
4. A vaccine comprising the live, attenuated virus of Claim 2, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
5. A method of vaccinating poultry against wild-type Delaware infectious bursal disease comprising administering to said poultry the vaccine of Claim 3, the virus thereof.
6. A monoclonal antibody which neutralizes Delaware strain infectious bursal disease viruses (DIBDV) .
7. The monoclonal antibody of Claim 6, which recognizes substantially the amino acid sequence of Figures 1-1E.
8. The monoclonal antibody of Claim 7, wherein the amino acid sequence varies from that of Figures 1-1E by at most 10 percent.
9. A purified preparation comprising a gene comprising substantially the nucleotide sequence of Figures 1-1E.
10. The purified preparation of Claim 9, wherein said 


nucleotide sequence varies from that of Figures 1-1E by at most 25 percent.
11. A reco binant expression vehicle which expresses the amino acid sequence recognized by the antibody of Claim 6.
12. The expression vehicle of Claim 11, wherein said expression vehicle comprises a gene comprising substantially the nucleotide sequence of Figures 1-1E.
