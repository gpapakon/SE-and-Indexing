<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device are specified for driving a series circuit of power semiconductor switches (2). In this case, the voltage load on the individual switches in the series circuit is compensated for in that the voltage (Uce1 ... Ucen) across each switch in the series circuit is measured as the control variable and the switching times are changed on the basis of this measured voltage such that the voltage load is essentially of equal magnitude for all the switches during switching. In addition, the measured voltage can be used to influence the magnitude of the control voltage (Ugeoff1 ... Ugeoffn) in the switched-off state such that the voltages across the switches when they are switched off are essentially of equal magnitude. The advantage of the invention can be seen in the fact that the voltage load on the individual semiconductors can be compensated for not only during switching but also when they are switched off. In addition, the regulation also compensates for influences of parameter differences and changes as well as influences from the circuitry. In consequence, the switches can be used optimally in terms of both power and frequency.
