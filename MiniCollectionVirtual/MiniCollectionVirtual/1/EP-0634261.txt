<ABSTRACT>
Foam forming techniques capable of permitting foaming of 
biodegradable resin to be positively and uniformly accomplished 

to provide a biodegradable resin foam (B) with satisfactory 
quality. The biodegradable resin foam is made of biodegradable 

resin consisting of a main biodegradable resin ingredient of 
100°C or more in melting point and a low-melting biodegradable 

resin ingredient of 100°C or less in melting point. The 
biodegradable resin foam is produced by placing a starting 

material consisting of at least biodegradable resin and a 
substantial amount of moisture in a heated and pressurized 

environment, releasing the starting material from the environment 

to foam the biodegradable resin, and subjecting the foamed resin 
to forming by means of a forming mold (A). An apparatus for 

producing the foamed biodegradable resin foam includes a pressure 
adjusting chamber (5), an air-permeable forming mold (A), a 

pressure reducing tank (T₁) and an injection machine (S).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for producing biodegradable resin foam. In general, synthetic resin has been applied to a 
variety of industrial fields because of exhibiting 
satisfactory mass productivity, moldability and 
durability. In particularly, synthetic resin foam is 
light-weight and exhibits increased cushioning properties, 
and is therefore widely used in various forms such as a 
protective casing for fragile articles such as glass 
products, cushioning material for packing, tableware, heat 
insulation material, sound insulation material and the 
like. However, this causes the amount of such synthetic 
resin products for disposal to be extensively increased, 
leading to various serious problems. More particularly, incineration of synthetic resin 
causes a large amount of harmful gas to be produced, 
leading to atmospheric pollution. Disposal of synthetic 
resin other than by incineration causes environmental 
pollution because it has resistance to oxidation and to 
decomposition by light and ozone. Also, synthetic resin 
has extensive intermolecular bonding, so that incineration 
causes generation of much heat, leading to damage to the 
furnace and therefore a decrease in its lifetime. In view of the foregoing, much attention has been 
recently directed to biodegradable resin and a great 
effort has been made to develop biodegradable resin. As a result, processing of biodegradable resin into a 
film material is now in the course of being put into 
practice. Also, development of foaming of biodegradable 
resin would lead to spread of applications thereof, to 
thereby permit advantages of  
 
biodegradable resin to be more widely exhibited. Techniques of 
foaming synthetic resin which have been carried out in the art 
include a method of producing foamed beads including the steps of 
charging styrene beads in a forming mold and adding water vapor 
thereto, followed by a decrease in pressure, a method of foaming 
synthetic resin by charging an extruder with, for example, 
styrene resin together with a foaming agent such as an organic 
solvent or the like to foam the resin due to a pressure reducing 
action occurring when the resin is extruded, and the like. However, such conventional chemical foaming techniques 
for foaming synthetic resin as described above fail to 
satisfactorily foam biodegradable resin due to a relationship 
between a softening point or melting point of the resin and a 
foaming temperature of a foaming agent and the like. Thus, there 
are known many
