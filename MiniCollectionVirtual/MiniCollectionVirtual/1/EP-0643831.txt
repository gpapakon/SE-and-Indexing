<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for determining the allergenic response of a sample of mammalian blood to an antigen, typically a food antigen. The method includes probing the blood sample after incubation with the antigen to determine the amount of degranulation of one or more of the granulocyte populations in the sample relative to an incubated antigen-free control; typically, the neutrophil population is probed.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD OF DETERMINING THE ALLERGENIC RESPONSE OF A SAMPLE OF MAMMALIAN BLOOD TO AN ANTIGENDESCRIPTIONThe present invention relates to a method of determining the allergenic response of a sample of mammalian blood to an antigen, particularly a food antigen. The invention also embraces an in vitro method of diagnosis for detecting an allergenic response to an antigen in a patient.Some patients are allergic to certain foods. The particular foods vary from patient to patient, and although the mechanism of the allergenic response to food allergens is not fully understood, it is thought that allergenic reactions to foods may in some patients be at least partly responsible for symptoms as diverse as migraine, asthma, eczema and arthritis. 

A particular disease in which food intolerance may be implicated is obesity. In some patients, obesity is a result of fluid retention. It is thought that in some patients an allergenic response to certain food antigens may give rise to an increase in the permeability of their blood capillaries; the capillaries become leaky, and water in the blood escapes into tissue juxtaposed the capillaries. As a result, the -patient may feel thirsty and drink more liquid than normal to compensate. However, the additional consumed fluid ultimately also escapes from the capillaries, and the patient becomes "fluid retaining" and puts on weight.Once an allergenic response to a particular food has been diagnosed in a patient, an effective treatment is the elimination of the food from the patient's diet. A typical daily diet, however, includes many different types of food; there can be considerable difficulty therefore in determining which foods cause an allergic response in a particular patient and should, therefore, be avoided. 

Furthermore, there is a general prejudice among medical professionals and the public alike against the recognition of a causal link between the symptoms mentioned above and allergic intolerance.In consequence testing for food intolerance has hitherto been confined outside mainstream general medical practice, and has included techniques for which the scientific basis has not been satisfactorily proven.Testing for food intolerance has conventionally been carried out by a "skin-prick" test in which a patient is pricked with a sterilized point carrying a small quantity of a food antigen. The patient's response to the food antigen is monitored visually to determine whether or not an intolerance is exhibited. Although a patient can be tested for intolerance to five or

CLAIMS
1. A method of determining the allergenic response of a sample of mammalian blood to an antigen; which method comprises the steps of:-
a) adding the antigen to the blood cell to challenge the white blood cells in the blood sample;
b) allowing the blood sample/antigen mixture to incubate;
c) thereafter probing the mixture to determine the amount of degranulation of one or more of the granulocyte populations in the blood sample relative to an incubated antigen-free control blood sample; and
d) comparing the amount of degranulation with a statistical mean degranulation derived from testing a plurality of other blood samples, thereby to determine whether the amount of 


 degranulation is significant as compared with said mean degranulation.
2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the blood sample/antigen mixture is probed to determine the amount of degranulation in the neutrophil population of the sample.
3. A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the amount of degranulation is determined by directly measuring the number of granules leaked by the granulocytes in the sample into the blood plasma.
4. A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the amount of degranulation is determined indirectly by measuring the loss of granules in the granulocytes in the sample.
5. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the amount of degranulation is determined using a haematology analyser which probes the white blood cell populations of the blood sample using a combination of radio frequency alternating current and direct current. 


6. A method as claimed in Claim 5 wherein a haematology analyser of the type commercially available from Messrs. Toa of Japan under the trade name SYSMEX NE 8000 is used.
7. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the amount of degranulation is deterrnined by calculating the apparent increase or decrease respectively in the monocyte/lymphocyte and granulocyte populations of the blood sample relative to the control.
8. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein a plurality of blood samples are tested, each with a different antigen.
9. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the antigen is a food antigen.
10. A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein a plurality of food antigens are selected which include sufficient foods to constitute a complete and balanced diet. 


11. An in vitro method of diagnosing an allergy in a patient, the method comprising taking a blood sample from the patient and determining the allergenic response of the sample to an antigen utilising a method as claimed in any preceding claim.
12. Apparatus for determining the allergenic response of a sample of mammalian blood to an antigen; which apparatus comprises:-
means for adding the antigen to the blood sample;
means for probing the blood sample/antigen mixture to determine the amount of degranulation of one or more of the granulocyte populations in the blood sample relative to an antigen-free control blood sample; and
means for comparing the amount of degranulation with a statistical mean degranulation derived from testing a plurality of other blood samples thereby to determine whether the amount of degranulation is significant as compared with the said mean degranulation.
