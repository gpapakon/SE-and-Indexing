<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine in which a circular housing 
is journaled to an end of a connecting rod remote from a piston 

at an eccentricity, and a rotary member is rotatably received in 
the circular housing, with an output shaft connected to the 

outer surface of the rotary member at an eccentricity. An 
internal ring gear provided in the circular housing meshes with 

a pinion gear fixed around a bearing. With this arrangement, it 
is possible to efficiently convert the explosion pressure in the 

combustion chamber into output torque on the output shaft, thus 
increasing the output torque of the engine while reducing fuel 

consumption. At the same time, the engine output power is 
stabilized in the low-speed region of engine operation. 

Consequently, the explosion pressure in the combustion chamber 
is efficiently converted into output power of the engine output 

shaft, thus achieving high efficiency and large output power of 
the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine 
such as a reciprocating internal combustion engine which operates 
at an improved rotation efficiency. In general, in a reciprocating internal combustion engine, 
air-fuel mixture introduced into a cylinder is compressed to a 
high pressure by upward stroking of the engine and is ignited 
when the piston has reached a position near the top dead center. 
As a result, combustion or explosion takes place to press down 
the piston thereby giving a large torque to the output shaft. More specifically, referring to Fig. 8, the crank 31 also 
is at its top dead center when the piston 30 is at the top dead 
center in its stroke, so that the connecting rod 32 which 
interconnects the piston 30 and the crank 31 extends on a common 
axis line x with the piston 30. Therefore, when the piston is at the top dead center, the 
force produced by the explosion pressure generated in the 
combustion chamber acts downward right on the crankshaft 33, 
with the result that part of the force is lost without being 
transmitted to the output shaft. This means that the required torque can never be obtained 
unless the engine speed is raised to a certain level, which 
uneconomically increases fuel consumption.  Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
overcome the above-described problem of the known art by 
providing an internal combustion engine which can efficiently 
transmitting the force generated by the explosion pressure in 
the combustion chamber to the engine output shaft, thus 
realizing high efficiency and large output power of the internal 
combustion engine. According to the present invention, this object is achieved 
by an internal combustion engine in which a circular housing is 
journaled to an end of a connecting rod remote from a piston at 
an eccentricity, and a rotary member is rotatably received in 
the circular housing, with an output shaft connected to the 
outer surface of the rotary member at an eccentricity. An 
internal ring gear provided in the circular housing meshes with 
a pinion gear fixed around a bearing. With this arrangement, it 
is possible to efficiently convert the explosion pressure in the 
combustion chamber into output torque on the output shaft, thus 
realizing high efficiency and large output power of the engine. The invention having the described feature offers the 
following advantage. When the piston is at the top dead center 
in its stroke, the journal portion on the other end of the 
connecting rod, at
