<DESCRIPTION>
 LOW TEMPERATURE CO-FIRED CERAMIC (LTCC)HIGH DENSITY INTERCONNECT PACKAGE WITH CIRCUITRY WITHIN THE CAVITY WALLSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe subject invention is directed generally to unit¬ ized multilayer circuit structures, and more particularly to a unitized multilayer circuit package having signal carrying circuits in the walls thereof.Unitized multilayer circuit packages are utilized to house and interconnect circuit devices such as integrated circuits, and can be formed from a plurality of integrally fused insulating layers (e.g., ceramic layers). For example, a unitized multilayer circuit package can include a plurality of layers that form a base portion, and walls disposed over the base portion that define a central cavity overlying the base portion. The base portion typically contains interconnect traces and circuit elements disposed between the layers thereof, and can also contain cavities formed in the top surface thereof for containing circuit devices being interconnected. The unitized multilayer circuit package is readily made into a DC and RF electri- cally shielded package by depositing conductive metalliza¬ tion on the top of the side walls, the sides of the circuit package, and on the bottom of the circuit package, and then conductively bonding a conductive cover plate onto the top of the side walls. The electrically shielded packages 

allow the placement of such packages next to each other and eliminates the need to place unitized circuit packages in an additional housing for electrical shielding.A consideration with known unitized multilayer circuit structures is the continual need for higher interconnect density.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt would therefore be an advantage to provide a unitized multilayer circuit package that provides for increased interconnect density.The foregoing and other advantages are provided by the invention in a unitized integrally fused multilayer circuit package having a substrate, walls disposed on the substrate to form a central circuit package cavity, and circuit traces contained in the walls.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGSThe advantages and features of the disclosed invention will readily be appreciated by persons skilled in the art from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the drawing wherein: FIG. 1 is a schematic perspective of a co-fired ceramic circuit package that incorporates circuitry in its walls in accordance with the invention.FIG. 2 is a schematic elevational sectional view of a DC interconnect structure that
