<ABSTRACT>
In a refrigeration system having low and high stage 
compressors (12,14,16) and a subcooler or economizer (28), 

economizer gas 
is selectively supplied to the compressor motors (13,15,17) for 

cooling and to the suction of the high stage (14,16) to increase 
capacity. By selectively controlling the delivery of the 

economizer gas, efficiency of the refrigeration system is 
increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a refrigeration system and a method of operating same.An economizer is normally employed to increase the
capacity of a refrigeration or air conditioning systems.
The discharge pressure varies seasonally and the saturated
condensing temperature can drop too low. Under these
circumstances the advantages of economizer operation is
minimal. In two-stage compressor systems employing an
economizer, injection normally takes place between the
stages such that economizer gas mixes with the high stage
suction gas supplied to the high stage. However, as the
load requirements change, either only the high stage, or
only the low stage may be used thereby obviating the
benefits of supplying economizer gas to the suction of the
high side. A refrigeration system of this type is disclosed in
US-A-4 947 655.A two-stage compressor system employing an economizer is
operated to optimize the efficiency of the system.Depending upon operating conditions, the system can be
operated in a number of ways: first, economizer operation
for high stage motor cooling and single stage high
temperature application; second, economizer gas is
delivered to the suction of the high stage and liquid
injection to cool the motors; and third, feed economizer
gas through the low stage for motor cooling and single
stage low temperature applications. High temperature
applications include such things as air conditioning and
food coolers in grocery stores while low temperature
applications include frozen food cases in grocery stores.It is an object of this invention to optimize the
efficiency of a two stage system.It is another object of this invention to provide
flexibility of operation and control. These objects, and
others as will become apparent hereinafter, are
accomplished by the present invention.To achieve this, the refrigeration system and method of the
invention is characterized by the features claimed in claims 1 and 5. 
Basically, economizer operation of a two-stage system is
controlled to achieve increased capacity, to optimize
efficiency, and for motor cooling and/or discharge
temperature control. Overall control is achieved by a
microprocessor which receives information, such as for example
pressure and temperature, from the refrigeration system and
in response to the received information controls the compressors and
flow in various parts of the refrigeration system to
achieve economizer operation, motor cooling and/or
discharge temperature control.Figures 1A and 1B make up a schematic drawing of a two-stage
