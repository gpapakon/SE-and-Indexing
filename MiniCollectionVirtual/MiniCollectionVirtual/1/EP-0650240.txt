<ABSTRACT>
An inductive charging apparatus (10) comprises a charge 
port (11) having a charge port housing (12); an outer heat 

exchanger disposed adjacent the internal periphery of the charge 
port housing (12); first and second magnetically coupled core 

halves disposed in the charge port housing (12) adjacent the 
heat exchanger; an opening (19) formed between respective first 

and second core halves that provides for a predetermined spacing 
between adjacent surfaces of the first and second core halves; 

first and second secondary windings disposed adjacent the opening 
(19) formed between the first and second core halves and disposed 

in an opening formed in each of the first and second core halves; 
and first and second inner heat exchangers disposed between 

the first and second secondary windings and the first and second 
core halves. The inductive charging apparatus further comprises 

a charging coupler (20) having a coupler housing (23); a center 
core (21) disposed in the coupler housing (23); and a primary 

winding (22) disposed around the center core (21). The center 
core (21) has a dimension such that it defines a predetermined, 

relatively fixed gap between the respective adjacent surfaces 
of the first and second core halves and respective outer surfaces 

of the center core when the charging coupler (20) is inserted 
into the charge port (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inductive charging 
apparatus, having a charge port comprising a charge port housing, 
first and second magnetically coupled core halves disposed in 
the charge port housing, an opening formed between respective 
first and second core halves that provide for a predetermined 
spacing between adjacent surfaces of the first and second core 
halves, and first and second secondary windings disposed adjacent 
the opening formed between the first and second core halves 
and disposed in an opening formed in each of the first and second 
core halves, a charging coupler comprising a coupler housing 
and a primary winding. Such an inductive charging apparatus is known from EP-A-0 
552 738.  
 The present invention generally relates to inductive charging apparatus, and 
more particularly, to an inductive charger for use with electric vehicles that comprises a 
charging port including a fixed secondary core and secondary winding and an insertable 
charging coupler including a primary core and primary winding wherein a precise gap 
is provided between the respective cores. The prior art for inductive coupling designed for use in electric vehicles 
involves an on-board charge port having a mechanized core assembly wherein two core 
halves open and close to accept an off-board coupler that is inserted between the cores. 
Mechanization of the prior art apparatus includes springs and levers for actuating the 
two core halves, and this approach has several drawbacks. The spring and lever mechanisms 
are prone to failure, and there is concern about chatter and core breakage during 
road-induced vibration and shock. In addition, the core surfaces can collect dirt, which 
prevents full closing of the core halves after insertion of the coupler between the core 
halves. This results in magnetic coupling inefficiencies due to variable, out-of-tolerance 
gaps between the cores. Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide for inductive 
charging apparatus that employs a fixed charging port and an insertable charging coupler 
wherein a precise gap is maintained between the coupler and the port to eliminate 
the above-cited problems.  
 The above objective is achieved by an inductive charging 
apparatus, mentioned at the outset, wherein the first and second 
core halves have a fixed nonmoving configuration, an outer heat 
exchanger is disposed adjacent the internal periphery of the charge port 
housing, the first and second magnetically coupled core halves being 
disposed
