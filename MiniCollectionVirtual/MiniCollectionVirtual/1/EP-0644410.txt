<ABSTRACT>
-Temperature measurements. -The thermocouple is characterised in that the core (5) consists of a conducting wire (6) chosen to be made of a conductive material which can provide a thermocouple effect with the material of the body, which wire is provided with an outer coating (7) of dielectric material and comprises, opposite the external connection, an end part (8) of increasing cross-section, the end part (8) is fitted via its dielectric layer into the housing (2), flush with the detection face (3) and is insulated from the body (1) in the plane of the face (3) by an insulating annular ring (15) formed by the layer (7). The end part and the detection face are covered with a conductive contact pellet (10). -Application to plastics technology.

Thermocouple sensor of the type comprising on the one
hand a tubular body (1) made of conductive material, with

a housing (2) passing through it, connected to an
external connection (13) and having a detection face (3),

and on the other hand a core (5) also made of conductive
material, capable of supplying a thermocouple effect with

that of the body, disposed in the housing, ending at the
detection face and connected, at the opposite end, to a

connection (12) external to the body and having, at the
opposite end to the external connection, an end part (8)

of increasing cross section,

characterised in that:

the core (5) consists of a conductive wire having, at
the opposite end to the external connection, an end part

of increasing cross section,
the core (5) and the end part (8) are provided with an
external layer (7) of dielectric material,
the end part (8) is embedded, through its dielectric
layer, in the housing (2), is flush with the detection

face (3) and is insulated from the body (1) in the same
plane as the face (3) by an insulating annular ring (15)

formed by the layer (7),
the end part and the detection face are covered by a
conductive contact slug (10).
Thermocouple sensor according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the core (5) delimits, with the
housing (2), an annular gap which is at least partly

filled in by a filling of insulating material (14).
Thermocouple sensor according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterised in that the core (5) extends, at the
opposite end to the detection face (3), out of the body

and is coated by the filling material (14).
Thermocouple sensor according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the layer (7) of dielectric
material is formed by oxidation of the material of the

core.
Thermocouple sensor according to Claim 1,

characterised in that the layer (7) of dielectric
material is formed by the deposition of a covering of

metallic oxide.
Method of manufacturing a thermocouple sensor
according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that

it consists of:

forming, in a conductive body (1), from a so-called
detection face (3), a through housing (2),
preparing a core (5), chosen in a conductive material
capable of supplying a thermocouple effect with that of

the body, in order to confer on said core an overall
cross section less than that of the housing and in order 

to give it an end part (8) with an increasing cross
section, the mean measurement (d) of which is greater

than the cross section of the housing in the same plane
as the detection face,
forming on the core a layer of dielectric material (7),
engaging the core in the housing through the detection
face in order to pass through said body completely and to

bring the end part in line with the detection face,
embedding the end part in the housing by partial
penetration of the body into the layer of dielectric

material,
levelling the end part in the same plane as the
detection face,
covering the detection face and the end part with a
conductive contact slug (10).
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in that it
consists of fitting an external connection (13) to the

body (1) and another (12) to the part of the core (11)
opposite to the end part (8) and projecting out of the

body.
Method according to Claim 6, characterised in that it
consists of embedding the end part (8) in the housing (2)

whilst subjecting the core to an axial stretching force. 
Method according to one of Claims 6 to 8,

characterised in that it consists of at least partly
filling in the housing occupied by the core, by adding an

insulating material (14).
Method according to Claim 9, characterised in that
the insulating material is deposited so as also to coat

the part (11) of the core (5) external to the body.
