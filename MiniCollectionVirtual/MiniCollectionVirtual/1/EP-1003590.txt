<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a portable protective system for protecting a wearer, and for protecting the environment about the wearer. The protective system includes a face shield coupled with a head cradle for supporting the face shield on the wearer's head. The face shield and a wearer's face substantially define a breathing zone charged by a battery-powered blower carried on the head cradle. A bag-like inlet filter element encompasses the blower to provide filtered air to the breathing zone, and an outlet filter element is operably associated with the face shield.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to protective systems designed to provide
combined respiratory and/or impact and splash protection for the user and
protection to the environment from the wearer's exhalation. More particularly, it
relates to lightweight, positive/negative pressure respiratory and protection devices.In recent years, it has become increasingly important to protect the health of
care providers without compromising that of the patient. This reflects the
increasing incidence of such infectious diseases as tuberculosis, acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, and herpes. Many factors should be considered in selecting a
proper protection device. For example, verbal, as well as visual communication
between a care provider and a worried patient can be critical in reassuring and
displaying concern to the patient. Furthermore, in an emergency situation, a
protective system that is easy to don and does not need facial or cranial adjustment
saves time. In addition, a protective device should be comfortable to wear for long
periods of time.Generally, while masking and shielding protective systems, including masks
and respirators, known prior to the present invention provide a high level of
protection, they are difficult to put on and properly adjust. Furthermore, these
devices may be uncomfortable to wear, even for short periods of time.
Additionally, many conceal part or all of the wearers' face, particularly the mouth.Protective systems incorporating ventilation or ventilation systems are
known. U.S. Patent 4,055,173 (Knab) discloses the use of a vacuum system to
draw air into and through the protective helmet and gown of the surgeon and to
filter that air prior to returning it to the room. The lack of mobility created by the 
need to tether the user to the device is not desirable, and there is no mention of the
need to protect the user from contaminants in the room. The issue of mobility is
addressed by U.S. Patent 4,019,508 (Der Estephaniuan, et al.). It describes a "back
pack" self-contained device to be worn by surgeons. However, wearing a back
pack may create balance, awkwardness and fatigue problems for the user and,
again, there is no mention of protecting the user from contaminants in the ambient
air.Positive pressure respirators are broadly used in industrial applications.
Their use is frequently regulated by government agencies. These devices provide
filtered air to a user. A compressed air line or a blower is used to deliver the air to
the hard-hat helmet or face piece of the respirator. U.S.

<CLAIMS>
A protective system (20), comprising:

a diffuser (44) having a surface, an air entry, an air exit, and at least one
internal baffle, said diffuser (44) defining an air flow path, said surface generally

complementary to a human forehead;
a substantially transparent face shield (22) coupled to the diffuser (44);
a head cradle (24) extending from the diffuser (44), said head cradle (24)
having a free end and a length extending generally between the free end and the

diffuser (44), a portion of the length being sufficiently arcuate whereby, when in use,
a portion of the head cradle generally conforms to a portion of the top and back of the

wearer's head, the head cradle (24) extends generally toward the wearer's occipital
promberance and said free end lodges against the wearer's head or neck in a region

generally beneath the occipital protuberance;
a blower (36) coupled to the diffuser (44) for generating an air flow through
the diffuser (44), said blower (36) having an inlet and said blower (36) operably

coupled to a power source; and
a filter (38) operably coupled to the diffuser.
The protective system (20) according to claim 1, and further comprising a
generally pliable exit seal (50) operably coupled to and disposed along the periphery

of the face shield (22) and adapted to generally engage and conform to the boundaries
of a human head, thereby forming a breathing zone defined by the face shield (22),

the surface of a wearer's face and the exit seal (50).
The protective system (20) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the diffuser (44)
has an air-impermeable strip (51) attached thereto.
The protective system (20) according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the
blower (36) has a blower controller operably connected thereto and carried on the

diffuser (44).
The protective system (20) according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein the exit
seal (50) comprises a nonwoven web connected to the face shield (22). 
The protective system (20) according to claim 5, wherein the exit seal (50)
comprises a nonwoven web of polypropylene and polyester fibers attached to the face

shield (22).
The protective system (20) according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the filter
(38) is a compliant, encompassing filter that at least substantially encompasses the

blower inlet.
A human-face protector comprising:

a head cradle (24) having a free end and a length, a portion of the length being
sufficiently arcuate whereby, when in use, a portion of the head cradle (24) generally

conforms to a portion of the top and back of the wearer's head, the head cradle (24)
extends generally toward the wearer's occipital protuberance and said free end lodges

against the wearer's head or neck in a region generally beneath the occipital
protuberance;
a substantially transparent, air-impermeable, rigid face shield (22) extending
from one end of the head cradle (24), said face shield (22) having a periphery and

formed to generally conform to the shape and exceed the size of a human face;
a fibrous face filter seal (50) disposed adjacent to and generally along the
periphery of the face shield (22) and adapted to engage and conform to the boundaries

of a human face, thereby forming a breathing zone defined by the face shield (22), the
surface of the human face and the face filter seal (50) when the

protector is worn, wherein air exhausting from the breathing
zone is filtered through the face filter seal (50); and
a filter (38) for filtering air entering into the breathing zone.
