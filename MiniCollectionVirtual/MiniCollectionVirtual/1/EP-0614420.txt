<ABSTRACT>
A tire air pressure sensor (18) is mounted on a vehicle wheel (10) and includes an inertial mass (40) which is urged radially outwardly by centrifugal force resulting from rotation of the wheel (10). The tire air pressure is applied to the inertial mass (40) in opposition to the centrifugal force. When the rotational speed of the wheel (10) is sufficient that the centrifugal force overcomes the applied air pressure, the inertial mass (40) moves radially outwardly and opens a switch (33). The speed at which the switch (33) opens is a predetermined function of the tire pressure. In another embodiment (130), a second sensor (154, 160) is provided to sense when the tire pressure is below a minimum value. A spring (140) urges an inertial mass (138) inwardly in opposition to the centrifugal force, and the tire pressure is applied to a bellows (154) having an end (160) which moves radially outwardly in proportion to the applied pressure. The bellows (154) opens a first switch (166) when the pressure is higher than the minimum value, and the inertial mass (138) moves radially outwardly away from the end (160) of the bellows (154) to open a second switch (168) when the wheel speed exceeds the value corresponding to the tire pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sensor arrangement for 
sensing the pressure in a tire which is mounted on a wheel of 
a vehicle, comprising inertial mass means supported by the wheel 
for movement along a radial axis thereof, the intertial mass 
means being urged radially outwardly along said axis by centrifugal 
force resulting from rotation of the wheel, pressure 
transmitting means for transmitting said pressure from the tire 
to the inertial mass means in opposition to said outward 
movement, and a switch means which is actuated by the intertial 
mass means in response to the centrifugal force and said pressure 
to a first state when the rotational speed of the wheel is below 
a predetermined value which varies as a predetermined function 
of said pressure, and to a second state when said speed is above 
said predetermined value. The present invention relates further to a vehicle wheel 
of a vehicle, comprising a body having a peripheral rim for 
mounting a tire thereon, said rim and said tire defining a 
pressurized inflation space, the above sensor arrangement being 
provided for sensing the pressure in said tire. Such a sensor arrangement and such a vehicle wheel are 
known from EP-A-0 335 082.  
 The present invention generally relates to the art of 
automotive vehicles, and more specifically to a wheel for 
a vehicle incorporating a sensor for continuously monitoring 
the air pressure in a tire mounted on the wheel during 
operation of the vehicle. Low tire pressure is a primary cause of excessive fuel 
consumption, tire wear and impaired steerability. A normal 
tire will typically leak on the order of 25 percent of its 
pressure per year due to its inherent permeability. It is 
thus good practice to maintain tire pressure on a regular 
basis. However, even checking tire pressure every few weeks 
may not prevent these adverse affects when a slow leak is 
present, and the leak may go undetected unless a careful 
record is maintained of how frequently the pressure in each 
tire has to be replenished. A fast leak or flat condition 
can rapidly cause damage to the tire and even render it 
unusable in a short period of time, but this condition may 
go unnoticed by an inexperienced driver until it is too 
late. It is thus highly desirable to have some mechanism 
that automatically indicates to the driver when the tire  
 
pressure is too low. One such system is disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,067,376 to Barabino. This patent discloses a 
high pressure air reservoir provided in the vehicle wheel,
