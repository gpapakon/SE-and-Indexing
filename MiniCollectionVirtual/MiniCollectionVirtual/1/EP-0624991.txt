<ABSTRACT>
Arrangements for recording and reproducing datareduced videoinformation 
are described. The recording arrangement comprises a datareduction unit (3) and 

a formatting unit (4). The formatting unit (4) generates packets (P
i
) each having a first, 
second and third packet portion (PP₁, PP₂ and PP₃). The first packet portion comprises 

a sync word (SW) and an identification word. The second packet portion comprises 
datareduced videoinformation of a first and a second datablock (MB₀, MB₁). A datablock 

comprises DC coefficients (DC
i
) and most significant and least significant AC 
coefficients (MAC
i
, LAC
i
). The videoinformation comprised in the first and the second 
datablock are stored in the second packet portion (PP₂), such that the DC coefficients of 

the first datablock (DC₀) are stored first, the plurality of most significant AC coefficients 
(MAC₀) of the first datablock are stored next, the DC coefficients of the second 

datablock (DC₁) are stored last in the second packet portion, and the plurality of most 
significant AC coefficients (MAC₁) of the second datablock are stored before the DC 

coefficients of the second datablock in the second packet portion. This enables an 
improved reproduction of the videosignal in a feature mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement for recording, at a predetermined
recording speed, a digital video signal in a track on a record carrier, the recording
arrangement comprising
an input terminal for receiving the digital video signal,data compression means for data reducing the digital video signal so as to obtain data
reduced video information in the form of a plurality of datablocks, each datablock
defining a subpicture of a plurality of subpictures in which a picture is divided, a
datablock comprising a number of n DC coefficients, where n is an integer for which
holds that n > 1, a plurality of most significant AC coefficients and a plurality of least
significant AC coefficients,formatting means for including datablocks in a plurality of packets for recording in a
track, a packet comprising a first packet portion including a synchronisation word and
an identification word, a second packet portion comprising data reduced
video information,recording means for recording the plurality of packets in a track on the record carrier.Furthermore, the invention relates to a method of recording,
to a reproduction arrangement and to a record carrier obtained with the recording
arrangement.A recording arrangement as defined in the opening paragraph is known
from published European patent application no. 492,704A1 (PHN 13.546). The
arrangement is in the form of an arrangement for recording a digital video signal in slant
tracks on a magnetic record carrier. It should however be noted that the invention is not
restricted to the use in helical scan digital video recorders, but is equally well applicable
in the recording and reproduction on/of disc-like record carriers, either magnetic or
optical record carriers.Various proposals have been done to re-arrange the sequence of the data
reduced video information obtained from the data compression means, prior to recording
the information on the record carrier, so as to enable reproduction in a so-called feature 
mode. A feature mode in helical scan recorders/reproducers means that the transport
speed of the longitudinal record carrier is other than the nominal speed, which is the
speed during recording. In disk recorders/reproducers, the reproducing means, which
include a magnetic or optical head, have a radial velocity in the feature mode which
differs from the radial velocity during recording.For a description of a feature mode reproduction in helical scan recorders/
reproducers, reference is made to European patent application no.
