<ABSTRACT>
The method concerns resistance welding of thin metal sheets with periodically pulsating, in partic., alternating half-waves of welding current produced from the prim. alternating voltage of a welding transformer. The method is characterised by the fact that the current density in the volume elements of the prod. (3) undergoing welding is modulated at a frequency (f2) by means of an additional magnetic field acting on the magnetic field of the current. The appts. includes a system in the form of a coil (9) and a core (10) for producing an additional magnetic field. A sinusoidal current with an amplitude of (I2) and a frequency of (f2) flows through the coil.
