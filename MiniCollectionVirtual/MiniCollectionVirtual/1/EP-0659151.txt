<ABSTRACT>
In a package, especially a pouch package, with a covering made of a flat foldable packaging material in which the inner sides of two strip-like edge regions (2, 3) are sealed together in a jointing region (1) to form the covering, there is a strip-like tear region (8) in the package covering which starts from one of the two strip-like edge regions (2), extends substantially perpendicularly thereto and has notches or linear punched-out regions only within the strip-like edge region (2). Here, at the beginning of the tear region (8) between the two strip-like edge regions (2, 3), there is a tab of flat material which is firmly secured to the edge region (2) from which the tear region (8) starts and is secured detachably or not at all to the other edge region (3), while the remainder of the flat (7) of the tab projects beyond the edge (5) of the edge region (2).

A pouch-type package which is formed from a planar, 
foldable packaging material, wherein to form the pouch 

two strip-like edge zones (2,3) are joined together, 
particularly on their inner sides, in a junction region (1) 

by a sealing in such a way that the sealed-together edge 
zones are folded over on to the package surface in the form 

of a fin, wherein a strip-like tear-off portion (8), which 
starts from one of the two strip-like edge zones and extends 

substantially perpendicular to this edge zone, has incisions 
(4) or linear perforations and also, optionally, weakening 

lines on its lateral boundaries, only within the strip-like 
edge zone, and wherein at the start of the tear-off portion 

(8) a grip tab (6) of planar material is provided,
 
characterised in that the the grip tab (6) comprises a 

separate piece of material and is so arranged between the 
two strip-like edge zones (2,3) that it is attached 

to the edge zone (2), from which the tear-off portion (8) 
starts, but is not attached to or is detachable from the 

other edge zone, the grip tab (6) projecting with its 
remaining surface portion (7) beyond the edge (5) of the 

edge zone (2), from which the tear-off portion (8) starts. 
A pouch-type package according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that grip tab (6) is narrower than the 

tear-off portion (8). 
A pouch-type package according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the grip tab (6) is wider than the 

tear-off portion (8) and outside the tear-off portion (8) is 
detachably connected to the edge zone (2), from which the 

tear-off portion (8) starts.  
 
A pouch-type package according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that in the edge zone (2), from which 

the tear-off portion (8) starts, the linear perforations 
(14) do not extend up to the free edge (5) of this edge zone 

(2). 
A pouch-type package according to any one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that within the tear-off portion 

(8) the sealing of the junction region (1) has, on average, 
lower peeling resistance than in the remainder of the 

junction region (1). 
A pouch-type package according to any one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that at least within the tear-off 

portion (8) the sealing of the junction region is in the 
form of a cross-line grid. 
A pouch-type package according to any one of Claims 

1 to 6, characterised by a packaging material which is built 
up with several layers selected from the group comprising 

paper, unstretched polyolefin sheet or film, aluminium foil, 
biaxially stretched polypropylene film, biaxially stretched 

polyamide film, biaxially stretched polyethylene 
terephthalate film and a composite of two or three layers 

of, optionally, the foregoing materials, wherein of all the 
adjacent different layers in the packaging material the 

respective layer in the group previously mentioned and with 
adjacent layers of like or similar material the respectively 

thinner layer is situated nearer the packaged goods, and 
wherein a sub-composite is used, between the layers of which 

there are adhesion which are substantially stronger 
than the adhesion between the sub-composite and the remaining 

layers of the packaging material.
