<ABSTRACT>
A mould (10,110) for moulding an element for covering an 
edge of a thin sheet of material, in particular fabric, 

comprising an chamber (13,113) with a 
substantially C-shaped section which clasps the edge and 

extends along the two sides of the sheet. The chamber (13,113) 
is provided on either side of the sheet with internal 

protrusions (14,114) opposingly directed towards the 
surface of the sheet to clamp it between them close to the 

edge. An eyelet (20) produced with a mould of this kind 
comprises a first innermost annular portion (21) having a 

generically C-shaped radial section which incorporates the 
edge of the hole and extends with the ends of the C along 

the two sides of the sheet (11). Each end of the C faces 
an annular element (22,23) disposed concentrically 

adhering to the corresponding surface of the sheet (11) 
and connected by means of ribs (24) to the first portion (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an innovative mould for covering 
cut edges in flexible thin material, in particular fabric, 
with elements moulded from plastic material. For example, 
it is advantageously possible to produce fabric belts 
having sturdy covered loops for the buckle or for hanging 
objects on it and/or ends incorporated into terminals made 
of plastic material. In making holes through fabrics or the like it is 
customary to cover the hole in order to prevent the 
material from weakening or becoming frayed. In the case of 
sufficiently rigid or compact materials, the hole can 
simply be reinforced by moulding an eyelet onto it with a 
generically U-shaped cross section so as to grip its 
edges. In the case of materials made by weaving or the 
like, the inevitable fraying around the edge of the hole 
prevents the protective eyelet from being moulded 
satisfactorily. In fact, the frayed edge cannot be held 
perfectly at the centre of the mould during injection of 
the plastic, since the flow of plastic itself tends to 
separate the threads and cause the edge to be incorporated 
to fray into a fringe. Similar problems are encountered in 
producing terminals, such as buckles, clasps or the like 
at the ends of belts or braces made of textile material. In order to obviate the problem, in the case of meltable 
materials, such as for example, nylon fabrics or the like,  
 
it has been suggested to melt together the threads along 
the edge of the cut or hole before moulding the coating. 
However, the need to carry out an additional operation 
increases the manufacturing costs. An alternative could be to use elements made of sheet 
metal to be clamped onto the edge of the cut. For example, 
it is possible to use conventional preformed metal eyelets 
which are clamped over the edge of the hole. This solution, however, does not provide the high degree 
of resistance offered by incorporating the edges inside 
molten plastic elements. The general scope of this invention is to obviate the 
aforementioned problems by providing an innovative mould 
and elements produced thereby which solve the problem of 
moulding the coating of cut edges in thin flexible 
materials, in particular fabrics. This scope is achieved, according to the invention, by 
providing a mould for moulding an element for covering an 
edge of a thin sheet of material, in particular fabric, 
comprising a chamber with a substantially C-shaped section 
crosswise to the extension of the edge which clasps the 
edge and extends along both sides of

Mould (10, 110) for moulding an element for covering an 
edge of a thin sheet of flexible material in particular 

fabric, comprising a chamber (13, 113) with a 
substantially C-shaped section crosswise to the extension 

of the edge which clasps the edge and extends along the 
two sides of the sheet, the chamber (13, 113) being 

provided on either side of the sheet with internal 
protrusions (14, 114) opposingly directed towards the 

surface of the sheet to clamp it between them close to 
said edge. 
Mould as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that said edge is the edge of a hole passing through the 

sheet, the chamber (13) being of an annular shape to 
radially grasp the edge of the hole. 
Mould as claimed in claim 2, characterized by the fact 
that the protrusions (14) on each side are shaped in the 

form of annular diaphragms interrupted by radial passages 
(19). 
Mould as claimed in claim 2, characterized by the fact 
of having ducts (15) for injection of moulding material 

which are connected to said chamber (13) in a radial 
direction from the centre of the ring defined by the 

chamber. 
Mould as claimed in claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that said edge is the edge of an end of the sheet made in 

the form of an elongated strip, the chamber (113) being of 
 

an elongated shape parallel to said edge. 
Mould as claimed in claim 5, characterized by the fact 
that the protrusions (114) on each side are made in the 

form of a diaphragm in the middle of the chamber 
interrupted by crosswise passages (119). 
Mould as claimed in claim 6, characterized by the fact 
of having ducts (115, 116) for injection of moulding 

material which are connected to said chamber (13) in 
alternate positions on both sides of the intermediate 

diaphragm.

of a thin flexible strip (101), in particular of fabric, 

obtained by means of the mould as claimed in claims 5, 6 
or 7.
