<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel antibacterial
and antineoplastic 7-trifluoromethyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,2-e]indole-8-carboxylic
acid ester derivatives,
6-trifluoromethyl-1,2,8,8a-tetrahydrocyclopropa[c]pyrrolo[3,2-e]indol-4(5H)-one-7-carboxylic
acid ester derivatives,
optically active isomers thereof, and pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof.CC-1065 is disclosed as an antibacterial and antineoplastic
antibiotic in J. Antibiotics, 31 1211 (1978) and
ibid,34 1119 (1981); and USP 4169888. Further, duocarmycin
A having a similar structure thereto and analogues thereof
are disclosed in WO87/06265, EP0318056, J. Antibiotics 42
1229 (1989), and JP-A-4-99774.Further derivatives of CC-1065 are disclosed in JP-A-60-193989,
and Japan Patent Kohyo 2-502005. Derivatives
of duocarmycins are disclosed in JP-A-3-7287, JP-A-3-128379,
EP0354583, and EP0406749. All of these compounds are
derived by utilizing the base skeleton of an unmodified
natural substance or by modifying chemically a natural
substance. The clinical therapy of cancer includes surgical
excision, X-ray radiotherapy, pharmacotherapy using a
chemotherapeutic agent(chemotherapy), and so forth.
Of these therapies, chemotherapy is the one and only therapy
for cancer having wide-spread metastasis in several body
regions and for cancer at the terminal stage. Originally,
chemotherapy is expected to be the least to burden a patient,
while in fact, chemotherapeutic agents hitherto
known impose severe strain on patients due to strong adverse
reactions. Further, there are several effective chemotherapeutic
agents against leukemia which grows rapidly, but most
of them are less effective against a solid tumor which grows
slowly. For these reasons, chemotherapy so far is not
always primarily adopted for cancer.In view of the present status of the chemotherapeutic
agents, the inventors of the present invention have
conducted comprehensively the investigation on compounds
which exhibit high selectivity to cancer cells and exhibit
high efficacy also on solid tumor with less toxicity.It was found by the inventors of the present invention
that the trifluoromethylpyrroloindolecarboxylic acid
ester derivatives represented by the general formula (1) and
(2) below, optical isomers thereof, and pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof exhibit excellent antibacterial
effects and antineoplastic effects, and further has high
selectivity to cancer cells with low toxicity:
