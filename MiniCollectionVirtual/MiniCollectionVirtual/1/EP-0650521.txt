<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the measurement of estradiol using competitive immunoassay methods. The inventors unexpectedly discovered that estrone and its derivatives conjugated to a label is a particularly effective tracer when used in conjunction with estradiol specific antibodies to determine estradiol levels in fluid samples. The present invention also utilizes 5 alpha -dihydrotestosterone to enhance the assay performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
Estradiol (1,3,5(10)-Estratrien-3,17a-diol) is secreted
by the ovary and placenta. It is synthesized by the
aromatization of androgens in the thecal and granulosa cells
of the ovary and placenta. The aromatization is stimulated by
follitropin (FSH). Estradiol synthesis in turn stimulates
production of Lutropin (LH) receptors necessary for the
synthesis of androgen precursors.Estradiol is important for female sexual differentiation
during gestation, sexual development at the onset of puberty,
and regulation of the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is
the result of a precise coordination of the functional
characteristics of the Central Nervous System, the
hypothalamus, the pituitary, the ovary, and the endometrium
which regulate the cyclic release of Gonadotropin Releasing
Hormone (GnRH), LH and FSH, and ovarian steroids (Estradiol
and Progesterone). Estradiol is involved in both the
stimulation and inhibition of the release of the gonadotropins,
exerting both a positive and a negative feedback. Early in the
follicular phase, ovarian secretion of estradiol from the
thecal and granulosa cells is modest. During the follicular
phase, estradiol stimulates endometrial growth (repairing the
endometrium after menses). Toward mid-cycle, LH production
increases and results in the release of the ovum by the rupture
of the developed follicle. After ovulation, estradiol secretion
declines slightly. During the luteal phase, estradiol along
with progesterone are secreted by the corpus luteum
stimulating further endometrial growth. If the ovum is not
fertilized, there is a further drop in estradiol and
progesterone. This drop in estradiol and progesterone
initiates menses.The measurement of estradiol is important for the
evaluation of normal sexual development (menarche), causes 
of infertility (anovulation, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea), and
menopause. Normal estradiol levels are lowest at menses and
during the early follicular phase (25-75 pg/ml). The levels
rise in the late follicular phase to a peak of 200-600 pg/mL
just before the LH surge initiates ovulation. As LH peaks,
estradiol begins to decrease before rising again during the
luteal phase (100-300 pg/mL). If conception does not take
place, estradiol falls further to its lowest levels, thus
initiating menses. If conception occurs, estradiol levels
continue to rise, reaching levels of 1-5 ng/ml during the first
trimester, 5-15 ng/ml during the second trimester, and 10-40
ng/ml during the third trimester. During menopause, estradiol
levels remain low.There are
