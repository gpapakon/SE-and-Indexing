<ABSTRACT>
In a continuous casting moulding for casting thin slabs, two cooled broad-side walls (1, 2) form, with two cooled narrow-side walls (3, 4) arranged adjustably between them, an upper moulding section and a lower supporting section. To improve product quality, in particular to avoid edge cracks, the narrow-side walls (3, 4) have differing side strips on the inner, working side of the moulding section and the supporting section, the side strips (3b'' and 4b') in the supporting section (3b and 4b respectively) being offset outwards relative to the side strips (3a' and 4a'') of the moulding section (3a and 4a respectively).

<CLAIMS>
Continuous casting chill mould for the casting of thin slabs, with cooled, wide side
walls and cooled narrow side walls adjustably arranged therebetween, which form an

upper mould part with a widened pouring-in region (5) and a lower support part,

characterised
 thereby that the narrow side walls (3, 4) in the mould part and support part
have different side strips at the inner working side and the side strips (3b" or 4b") in the

support part (3b or 4b) are displaced outwardly relative to the side strips (3a' or 4a") of the
mould part (3a or 4a) for formation of a spacing between cast strip and narrow side wall.
Continuous casting chill mould according to claim 1, 
characterised
 thereby that the
working side of each narrow side wall (3) consists of a flat upper portion (3a') and a lower

portion (3b) with lowered side strips (3b").
Continuous casting chill mould according to claim 1, 
characterised
 thereby that the
working side of each narrow side wall (4) consists of an upper portion (4a) with elevated

side strips (4a") and a flat lower portion (4b').
Continuous casting chill mould according to claim 1, 
characterised
 thereby that the
width of the side strips (3b", 4a") amounts to at most 15 millimetres.
Continuous casting chill mould according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised
 thereby
that the length of the outwardly displaced side strips (3b") in the lower section (3b) of the

narrow side wall (3) amounts to at most 400 millimetres.
Continuous casting chill mould according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised
 thereby
that the length of the protruding side strips (4a") in the upper portion (4a) of the narrow

side wall (4) amounts to at least 400 millimetres.
