<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a hollow lighting structure
of the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1.There are a wide range of applications for
internally illuminated structures such as light fixtures,
and signs. Particularly in the case of signs, it is highly
desirable for the light emitting portion of the structure
to have an accurately controlled distribution of light
intensity, which in most cases is preferably a uniform
distribution. In the past, there have been two primary
approaches to obtaining such a desired intensity distribution.
In the first, the desired distribution is achieved
by providing a large number of light sources within the
structure, and by ensuring that the thickness of the
structure is at least as great as the spacing between the
light sources, so that the light intensity is not substantially
weaker at points on the light emitting portion of
the structure which are not adjacent to the light sources.A second method of controlling the light
intensity distribution and achieving uniformity is to
provide a variable transmission filter at the external
surface of the structure, as disclosed in
US-A-4 937 716 issued 26 June, 1990 for an invention
of Lorne A. Whitehead entitled "Illuminating Device Having
Non-Absorptive Variable Transmissivity Cover". The light
transmissivity characteristic of the filter is varied as a
function of position to reduce the intensity of the light 
at places where it might otherwise be too high by reflecting
light away from such places; and, to redirect a portion
of the reflected light into regions where it is desirable
for the light intensity to be increased.A wide range of light sources can be beneficially
employed, generally falling into two categories; namely,
direct sources, and emitting light guide sources. In the
former case, light passes directly from the light source(s)
to the light emitting surface(s) of the structure, whereas
in the latter case light is first distributed in at least
one dimension by one or more light guides, such as solid
dielectric light guides, or prism light guides. In principle,
the size and shape of the light sources may be
conformed to the size and shape of the internally illuminated
structure itself, in which case uniform illumination
of the light emitting portion(s) of the structure is not a
problem. Also, in principle, it is possible to cover the
entire light emitting surface of the structure with a
variable transmissivity filter as described above, in which
case uniformity is again achievable. However, both of
these

<CLAIMS>
A hollow lighting structure (42) having an optically
transmissive light emitting surface (44), at least one at least

partially cylindrical light guide (36, 38, 40) extending
within said structure (42) and a light source (30, 32, 34)

said light guide (36, 38, 40) is provided with a pattern
means (54), predetermined as a function of a desired

resultant distribution of light intensity on said light
emitting surface (44) and adapted to allow a controlled

fractional escape of light at any point of the light guide

said light guide (36) further comprises a sheet of material

flexibly deformable from an initial laid-flat configuration
into a curved, assembled configuration.
A lighting structure as defined in claim 3, comprising
a patterned metallic film (54) on said light guide (36, 38,

A lighting structure as defined in claim 4, wherein
said film (54) is adapted to impart substantial longitudinal

specular reflectivity to said light guide (36, 38, 40). 
A lighting structure as defined in claim 5, wherein
said light source (30, 32, 34) is located outside said

structure (42).
