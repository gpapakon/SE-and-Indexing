<ABSTRACT>
An improved process is described for obtaining triazacyclononanes (I), especially 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane. The first step involves reacting diethylenetriamine (DET) with a sulfonylation agent to form a sulfonamidated DET, in an aqueous medium with an inorganic base. In a second step, but preferably within the same reactor vessel without isolating intermediates, the sulfonamidated DET aqueous mixture is contacted with an aprotic organic solvent in the presence of a cyclizing unit such as ethylene glycol ditosylate or ethylene dibromide, thereby resulting in a cyclized sulfonamidated triamine compound. Thereafter the protecting groups are removed and the amine is alkylated, preferably within a single reaction vessel without isolation of intermediates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improved synthesis of
triazacyclononane rings, especially of 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane
useful as a ligand with manganese
in a catalyst for bleaching.Recently a series of manganese complexes have been
identified as exceptionally active for bleaching fabrics.
The unusual catalytic performance of the complex can at
least partially be attributed to its unusual ligand,
1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane, hereinafter
referred to by its acronym, 1,4,7-Me3TACN. The catalysts
have the general structure:
Mn2(µ-0)3(1,4,7-Me3-TACN)2(PF6)2A significant economic problem with the catalyst is the
cost of the ligand. Synthesis of 1,4,7-Me3TACN has been
set forth principally by Richman and Atkins in Organic
Synthesis,58, pp. 86-98 (1978). Additional important

(10), at pp. 1961 (right column) describes tosylation of
diethylenetriamine in an aqueous base. Relevant patent
literature includes EP 0 375 333 and WO 86/02352.While the Richman and Atkins approach to 1,4,7-Me3TACN is
satisfactory for small scale preparations, it is not
amenable to large scale production. Furthermore, the
known process consists of six synthetic steps and a waste
stream (solvents not recyclable) which renders the route
unattractive. Safety issues also arise with the known
art. Thus, an improved procedure was found to be
imperative.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved synthesis of triazacyclononanes involving a
reduction in the number of steps and the number of
intermediates required to be isolated compared to prior
art methods.Another object of the present invention is to provide an
improved synthesis of triazacyclononanes which avoids or
reduces undesirable solvents such as
