<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an immersion nozzle for
introducing molten metal from a tundish to a mold for continuous
casting of molten metal, and more particularly to a structure of the
immersion nozzle. US-A-3888294 discloses an immersion nozzle having the pre-characterising
features of claim 1 below.Immersion nozzle made of refractory material is used to
introduce molten steel from a tundish to a continuous casting mold.
Particularly when a high speed casting for producing a slab is
carried out, a shape of an immersion nozzle which has a pair of exit
ports opening toward a shorter side of the mold as shown in Fig. 20
(A) and Fig. 20 (B) presently is used in general.And in a continuous casting, it is generally required to solidfy
the molten steel stably and to remove, by floatation, non-metallic
inclusion contained in the molten steel which causes ingot defects.Therefore, an immersion nozzle is required to have flow of
molten steel dispersed uniformly in the mold, to have non-metallic
inclusion floated, and to give an adequately uniform flow of the
molten steel on the surface of the molten steel in the mold. In
addition, it is wanted that the molten steel which is discharged
from left and right exit ports on a side wall of the nozzle and 
then moves toward the shorter side on left and right of the mold
makes no flow difference on both directions and that the molten
steel flow which hits the shorter side of the mold and is separated
into an upward flow and a downward flow gives an adequate flow rate
in a shorter side upward flow.If a surface flow speed of the molten steel within the mold is
not in an adequate range, problems described below occur. When the
surface flow speed of the molten steel is lower than the adequate
range, the heat of the molten steel introduced through the exit
ports is insufficient, which may cause a partial solidification of
the molten steel surface to bring the solidified pieces into an
ingot to result in an ingot defect and, in the worst case, in an
interruption of casting operation. When the surface flow speed of
the molten steel is above the adequate range or when an unbalance
flow of the molten steel is excessive, powder floating on the molten
steel surface is entrapped into the ingot to raise powder defects,
which causes degradation of the ingot in quality.When the unbalance flow of the molten steel occurs, a penetration
depth of the molten steel flow downward into a molten steel pool in
the mold increases by 20 to 40% more than that of normal operation,
which makes
