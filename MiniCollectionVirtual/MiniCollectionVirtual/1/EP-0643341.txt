<ABSTRACT>
The zero point setting system uses a zero setting cycle in which the coordinate measuring machine (1) is moved in a 3-dimensional space, the measured values provided by the sensor device (6) being checked. Dependant on the results of this check the sensor device is automatically zeroed and the zero setting cycle is terminated, or the numerical control is used to indicate further movement of the sensor device, until no deviation in the measured values is detected, the device then zeroed and the setting cycle terminated. Pref. the zero setting cycle is initiated before each measuring cycle, or is initiated under manual control.

A method of setting a reference point in measuring feeler systems (6) which are used with
numerical control (NC) devices in multi-coordinate measuring devices (1), wherein the following

method steps are performed in the method:

the "set reference point" cycle is started
the multi-coordinate measuring machine (1) carries out a spatial movement with the feeler
system (6)
the measured values of the feeler system (6) are tested for changes, the feeler system (6) being
automatically zeroed in dependence on the test results, in that two alternative method steps are

effected in dependence on the test results:

a) if the measured values do not change, the feeler system (6) is automatically zeroed and the
"set reference point" cycle is terminated;
b) if the measured values do change, the numerical control (NC) causes further movements of
the feeler system (6), until its measured values no longer change, then automatically zeroes

the feeler system (6) and the "set reference point" cycle is terminated.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the "set reference point" cycle is
automatically started before each measuring cycle.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the "set reference point" cycle can be started
manually at any time.
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the alternatives according to claims 2 and 3
are freely selectable.
A calibrating method according to claim 1, characterized in that the method steps are preceded by
a calibration operation. 
A calibrating method according to claim 5, characterized in that the calibration operation consists
in that, after a current interruption


a reference mark of the feeler system is traversed at least in one coordinate from the starting
position of the measuring feeler system
a measured value happening to occur at the reference mark is cleared
the measuring system is returned to its starting position and
the distance from the reference mark to the starting position is stored in an arbitrary memory.
