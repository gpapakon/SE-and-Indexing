<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for folding and/or connecting paper webs along a common folding and/or attachment line along which, by means of at least one application head (6), a linear application of fluid in the form of folding-aid fluid and/or glue is applied. In the case of said method, reliable monitoring of the position of the fluid application can be effected in that the fluid used has pigments added to it, which pigments are invisible under normal light and are visible when exposed to associated visualisation means, and in that the fluid application (4) is rendered visible in at least one of the paper webs (3) and a measurement is taken of its distance (a) from the desired position (18) in order to form a measure for the adjustment of the application head (6).

<CLAIMS>
Method of folding one or more sheets of paper and/or joining
at least two sheets of paper along a common fold and/or stitching

line along which a linear application of fluid in the form of
folding aid fluid and/or glue is applied by means of one or more

applicator heads (6), 
characterized in that
 the fluid used
contains added pigments which are invisible under normal light

and visible when subjected to assigned means of rendering
visible, and that the fluid application (4) is made visible on

one or more of the sheets of paper (3) and its distance (a) from
the desired position (18) is measured to form a measure for

adjustment of the applicator head (6).
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
distance (a) is measured on the finished product.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
distance (a) is continuously monitored and, based on this, an

adjustment device (13) assigned to the applicator head (6) is
actuated.
Device for implementing the method according to any of the
preceding claims, having one or more applicator heads (6) mounted

on a holder (7) adjustable by means of a preferably remote-controllable
adjusting device (13), 
characterized in that
 a
measuring table (15) equipped with a measuring scale (17) is

provided, on which a product (19) may be placed, and which is
provided with means of making visible, preferably in the form of

a UV lamp (16) which may be switched on and off, and that the
adjusting device (13) assigned to the applicator head (6) can be

activated during continuous operation, and a display unit (23,
24) indicating the set distance is provided. 
Device according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the
measuring table (15) is located alongside a control console (12)

with facilities (22) for remote control of the adjusting device
(13) and preferably a display unit (23, 24) to indicate the set

distance.
Device for implementing the, method according to claim 3,

characterized by
 one or more sources of rendering visible
assigned to a movable pigment carrier, and one or more

coordinated sensors through which is generated an output signal
to activate an alarm device and/or adjust the applicator head in

the absence of light reception.
