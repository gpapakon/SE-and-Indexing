Cross-country ski boot, consisting of an upper 
(1) secured to a sole (5) whose outer lower face (6) has 

a longitudinal guide slot (7) extending along the longitudinal 
axis of the boot, from the toe (8) to the heel 

(9), the said sole (5) furthermore having two means for 
binding to the upper face of the support region of a ski, 

the first means (10, 15, 20) being a binding and articulation 
means located close to the front end of the sole 

(5), characterized in that the second binding means (11, 
21) is arranged in the same longitudinal slot (7), level 

with the metatarsophalangeal joint, and can interact with 
a second, complementary binding means arranged on the 

upper face of the support region of a ski, which can be 
actuated separately from the first complementary binding 

means of the first articulation means (10). 
Cross-country ski boot according to Claim 1, in 
which the first binding means consists of a transverse 

pin, characterized in that the second binding means 
consists of a pin (11), parallel to the first (10) and 

arranged slightly in front of the metatarsophalangeal 
joint. 
Cross-country ski boot according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the first binding means is a bent 

pin (15) and the second means (11, 21) interacts with the 
first in order to ensure safety release of the boot. 
Cross-country ski boot according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the second binding means (21) has 

the form of a hook (21) having a ramp (22) in order to 
allow safety release of the boot. 
Assembly for the practice of skiing using a boot 
according to one of Claims 1 to 4, which assembly comprises 

a ski and a binding, the said binding comprising: 

a member (50) capable of interacting with and 
retaining the first means (10) for binding the sole 

(5) of the boot, which slides in a plane parallel to 
the plane of the upper face of the ski (30), 
a control means (46), arranged in front of the 
binding (35), intended to slide the said member (50)  

 
until it is engaged in the first binding means (10), 
 
characterized in that the binding includes a second 

member (65) capable of interacting with and retaining the 
second means (11, 21) for binding the sole (5) of the 

boot, arranged close to the metatarsophalangeal joint. 
Assembly according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the second member (65) can be engaged only when the 

first member (10) is engaged, whereas the two binding 
members (10, 65) can be disengaged simultaneously. 
Assembly according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the two binding members which interact with the two 

means (10, 11) for binding the sole (5) of the boot are 
formed by hooks (53, 65) which are open towards the 

front, these two hooks (53, 65) being actuated by the 
control member (46) of the binding (35), the first hook 

(53) when practising the alternating step technique, and 
both hooks (53, 65) together when practising the skating 

technique. 
Assembly according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the second hook (65), intended to interact with the 

second means (11) for binding the sole (5) of the boot, 
has a limited upward travel. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that the binding of the ski has a second 

member (62), capable of actuating the second hook (65) to 
engage it in the second binding means (11). 
Assembly according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the second member is a sliding member (62) capable 

of sliding to the front of the binding while moving the 
second hook (65) with it.
