<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dispensing systems,
and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus
for dispensing two-component materials, such as for
example, polymeric materials.Two-component polymeric materials such as
reactive adhesives, paints, gasket materials and
caulking materials comprise two separate components
which react chemically with one another when
intermixed. For example, two-component hot melt
polymeric materials used in adhesive applications
include a high volume polymeric material and a
lower volume polymeric material such as a hardener.
These types of hot melt adhesives, and other two-component
polymeric materials, are dispensed from a
system in which the two components are supplied
from separate sources in a predetermined ratio to a
dispensing device which then discharges the 
components into a mixer where the components are
intermixed with one another before being emitted
onto a substrate.One problem with two-component dispensing
systems of this type is that the two materials
forming the two-component mixture begin to cure as
soon as they come into contact with one another,
and tend to collect on surfaces of both the
dispenser and mixer, particularly when such
components are dispensed intermittently. These
cured materials can plug or at least constrict the
flow of materials through the dispenser and mixer
much like arteriosclerosis causes problems with
constricting the flow of blood through the arteries
and heart.The problem of constriction of the flow paths
through two-component dispensing systems has been
addressed in EP-A-0494451, being published on 15.07.92 with a
priority date of 11.01.91, in which a
purging operation is performed to remove cured
material from the system. In the practice of the
method, the
supply of one of the two components to the
dispenser and mixer is shut off, while the flow of
the other component into the mixer portion of the
system is permitted to continue. If hot melt
polymeric materials are being dispensed through the
system, for example, the high volume polymeric 
material may be used as the flushing material to
perform the purging operation while the flow of the
low volume polymeric material such as a liquid
hardener is discontinued. The method
has proven
effective to purge the cured or partially cured
mixture of the two components from the mixer
portion of the system, but problems remain with
removing the cured mixture from those portions of
the dispenser where the two components come into
contact with one another. Without an effective

A method of dispensing a two-component mixture of
polymeric materials comprising the steps of:


a) actuating a check valve (104), carried at the
discharge outlet of a first passageway (116) formed within

a dispenser (74), to an open position by moving a plunger
tip (122) of the valve (104) relative to the valve seat

(132) thereof;
b) directing the flow of a first material through
the first passageway (116) and the check valve (104) while

directing the flow of a second material through a second
passageway (82,90,92) formed within the dispenser (74);
c) smoothly directing the flow of both materials
over at least the plunger tip (122) of the check valve

(104); and
d) discharging the resultant mixture from the
dispenser (74).
A method as claimed in Claim 1, further comprising
the steps of:


terminating the flow of the first material by
moving the check valve (104) to a closed position; and
directing a flow of material from the second
passageway (92) past at least a portion of the outer

surface of the check valve (104) to substantially remove
the mixture of the first and second components from the

dispenser (74).
A method as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein the step of directing the flow of the second

component through the second passageway (82,90,92) includes
causing a check valve (85) carried within the second

passageway (82) to move to an open position and wherein the
method further comprises the step of selectively

terminating the flow of each of the first and second
components while simultaneously creating a suction within 

the second passageway (82,90,92) and the dispenser (74) by
permitting the check valve (85) of the second passageway to

move from the open position to a closed position, wherein
the escape of the mixture is substantially prevented.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim wherein
the step of directing the flows of the first and second

materials comprises supplying a metered slug, or dose, of
predetermined volume of each of the first and second

materials so as to discharge a predetermined volume of the
resultant mixture from the dispenser (74).
A dispensing apparatus for dispensing a two-component
mixture of polymeric materials comprising a dispenser body

(80) formed with a first passageway (116) having an inlet
(96) adapted to connect to a source (70) of a first

material and a first discharge outlet (118), and, a second
passageway (80,90 92) having an inlet (84) adapted to

connect to a source (72) of a second material and a second
discharge outlet, a valve (104) located at the first

discharge outlet and comprising a valve seat (132) located
at the first discharge outlet and a plunger (108) having a

position relative to the valve seat (132), at least a

portion of the valve (104) being located in the path of the
second material emitted from the second discharge outlet so

that the second material flows past the first discharge
outlet and combines with the first material emitted from

the first discharge outlet (118) prior to discharge from
the dispenser body (80), wherein at least the plunger tip

(122) is located in the path of the second material emitted
from the second discharge outlet and wherein the valve seat

(132) includes a radially inwardly tapering surface and the
plunger tip (122) includes a rounded bearing surface (124)

engageable with the radially inwardly tapering surface of
the valve seat (132) and an elongated, trailing portion

(126) which tapers radially inwardly from the rounded 
bearing surface (124) such that, in the open position, a

mixture of the first and second materials flows smoothly
therepast without substantially inducing dead spots in the

flow and, in the closed position, the flow of material from
the second discharge outlet is likewise smoothly directed

therepast.
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein, in the
course of moving from the open to the closed position, the

plunger tip (122) slidably moves along the valve seat (132)
to substantially wipe away any entrapped material

therebetween before becoming fully seated.
Apparatus as claimed in either Claim 5 or Claim 6,
wherein one of the valve seats (132) and the plunger tip

(122) has an external configuration such that upon movement
of the plunger tip (122) to the closed position, flow of

material discharged from the second discharge outlet past
the valve seat (132) and plunger tip (122) is effective to

substantially remove the first material, or a mixture of
the first and second materials.
