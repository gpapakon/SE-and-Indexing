<DESCRIPTION>
 GAS PHASE POLYMERIZATION OF ETHYLENE AND Cη TO C[n OLEFINSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for preparing ethylene- C6 to CIO α- olefin copolymers by gas phase polymerization in the presence of a transition metal catalyst system which is activated by an organoaluminum cocatalyst or an ion exchange reagent containing a stable non-coordinating anion. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Copolymers of ethylene and an α-olefin having 6 to 10 carbon atoms are desired for a variety of applications. The nature, content and distribution of the comonomer in the copolymer significantly influences its physical and chemical properties. Ethylene homopolymers such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) have a density of 0.94 to 0.96 g/cc and are generally linear ~ without any substantial side chain branching —whereas low density polyethylenes (LDPE) have a density of 0.915 to 0.940 g/cc is a highly branched polyethylene, i.e., relatively large numbers of long chain branches extend from the main polymer backbone. In contrast, a linear type of ethylene polymer may be produced having a density in the range of low density polyethylene, or less, by copolymerizing ethylene with an α- olefin comonomer — such as hexene, octene or decene — to introduce enough short chain branches into the otherwise linear ethylene polymer to reduce its density in an amount which is proportional to that amount of comonomer which is incorporated into the polymer In a linear copolymer of ethylene density decreases with increasing amounts of incorporated comonomer. A polymer of ethylene which incorporates an amount of α-olefin comonomer to provide a density of0.915 to 0.94 g/cc is referred to as linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), even higher levels of α-olefin comonomer incorporation provide a polymer of density ranging from 0.85 to 0.90 g/cc and this material is referred to as very low density polyethylene (VLDPE). For applications such as extrusion coating or blown film, a low or very low density linear polyethylene is preferred.The nature of the comonomer utilized in preparing a linear copolymer of ethylene may exert a significant influence on other properties of the polymer, such as impact strength and gaugeability For instance, a copolymer prepared with 1- octene as the comonomer has greater impact strength and gaugeability than does an ethylene copolymer prepared with 1 -hexane or 1 -butane at a similar level of comonomer incorporation Further, the manner and randomness with which a 

 - 9 comonomer is distributed
