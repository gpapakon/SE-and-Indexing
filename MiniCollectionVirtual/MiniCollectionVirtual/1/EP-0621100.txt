<ABSTRACT>
A water-tight structure of a simple construction which has a high waterproofng 
effect and a low sliding resistance, and which is provided between 

a lower arm of and a processing liquid tank for an immersion wire 
electric discharge machine. First and second water-tight structures are provided 

between a wall (24) of a processing liquid tank (23) through which a 
lower arm (22) is passed and the lower arm (22). The first water-tight structure 

is provided with a slide plate (27) moving slidingly along with the lower 
arm (22), and the second water-tight structure is provided with an oil seal 

(29) which is provided at the portion of the slide plate through which the lower 
arm (22) passes, and which contacts the outer circumferential surface of 

the lower arm (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an immersion type 
wire cut electric discharge machine for performing 
electric discharge machining on a workpiece immersed in 
a working fluid, and more particularly to a watertight 
structure between a lower arm and a working fluid tank 
of an immersion type wire cut electric discharge 
machine. FIG. 3 shows the construction of a conventional 
immersion type wire cut electric discharge machine 10. 
An upper arm 11 is installed above a working fluid tank 
13 for storing a working fluid, and a lower arm 12 
projects into the working fluid tank 13 in an opposed 
relation to the upper arm 11. A wire electrode 15 is 
stretched between a lower nozzle guide 12a mounted at 
the tip end of the lower arm 12 and an upper nozzle 
guide 11a mounted at the tip end of the upper arm 11. 
Electric discharge is induced between the wire electrode 
15 and a workpiece (not shown) placed in the working 
fluid tank 13. The working fluid tank 13 is mounted on 
a table 16 which is moved in an X-Y coordinate plane in 
accordance with a working program, and moves in the X-axis 
direction, which is perpendicular to the paper 
surface of FIG. 3, and in the Y-axis direction, which is 
parallel to the paper surface, with respect to the lower  
 
arm 12. Therefore, a watertight structure for 
permitting the movement in the X- and Y-axis directions 
must be installed between the lower arm 12 and a wall 14 
of the working fluid tank 13 which the lower arm 12 
penetrates. An elongated hole 14a extending in the X-axis 
direction is formed in the wall 14 of the working fluid 
tank 13, and the lower arm 12 extends through this 
elongated hole 14a. The watertight structure for the 
movement in the X-axis direction is usually constituted 
by a slide plate 17 which shields the elongated hole 14a 
and moves freely in the X-axis direction. The 
conventional watertight structure for permitting the 
movement in the Y-axis direction consists of a bushing 
18 which is annularly formed of leather or rubber and 
arranged between the slide plate 17 and the lower arm 
12. Alternatively, the conventional watertight 
structure consists of a bellows one end of which is 
fixed to the lower arm 12 and the other end to the slide 
plate 17 to be freely expanded and contracted in the Y-axis 
direction. However, in order to ensure high watertightness by 
using leather or rubber in the watertight structure for 
permitting the movement in the Y-axis direction, the 
contact area between the bushing and the outer 
peripheral
