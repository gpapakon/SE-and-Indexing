<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structural element (3) for heat insulation, between two structural parts (1, 2) which are to be concreted, by means of an insulating body (4) with integrated reinforcement bars (5, 6, 7). In order to use the structural element (3) in the case of prefabricated hollow panels (1, 2) with cavities (1a) extending perpendicularly with respect to the structural element (3), the compression bars (6) arranged in the lower region of the insulating body (4) are extended on both sides such that they alternatively also function as tension bars, and the position of the reinforcement bars (5, 6, 7) in the insulating body (4) is adapted to the grid dimension of the intermediate webs (1b) located between the cavities (1a).

Structural member (3) for heat insulation between two
structural parts (1, 2) to be concreted, in particular

between a building and an overhanging external part,
consisting of an insulating body (4) to be laid in between

shear force bars (5, 6, 7) extending transversely to the

insulating body (4) through the latter and projecting on
both sides into the structural parts (1, 2) to be concreted,

wherein the shear force bars (7) are bent such that they
pass obliquely downwards from the building side through the

insulating body (4) and then project in the region of the
