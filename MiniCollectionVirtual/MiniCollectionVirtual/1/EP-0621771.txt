<ABSTRACT>
A nail lacquer composition which comprises 0.05 to 10 % by weight of crystalline inorganic fibres having an aspect ratio of at least 2:1 is described. Preferred inorganic fibres are calcium salts such as calcium metasilicate and calcium sulphate. The use of such fibres has been found to give nail lacquer compositions with excellent wear and adhesion properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to nail lacquer 
compositions and in particular to nail lacquers 
containing at least one fibrous additive. Organic fibres such as nylon and silk have been 
incorporated into nail varnishes and associated products 
for a number of years. Nail varnishes containing such 
fibres are claimed to have improved properties including 
increased wear and protection against nail splitting, 
cracking, peeling and breaking. However, nylon and silk 
fibres have also been associated with certain 
disadvantages in nail varnish systems because they are 
soft and flexible and because the adhesion between the 
fibres and the nail varnish resin is low. US 4,873,077 discloses the use of glass fibre in 
nail hardening compositions. GB 1,177,420 and 
FR 1453089 disclose a composition for mending 
fingernails comprising organic fibres or inorganic 
fibres such as glass, asbestos or stainless steel 
fibres. US 4,646,765 discloses the use of graphite 
fibres in a nail extender or repair composition. Surprisingly, the applicants have now found that 
the use of certain inorganic fibres in nail lacquers 
provides compositions having superior properties. Accordingly, the present invention provides a nail 
lacquer composition which comprises 0.05 to 10%, 
preferably 0.05 to 5%, by weight of substantially 
insoluble crystalline inorganic fibres having an aspect 
ratio of at least 2:1, preferably of at least 4:1, 
wherein said fibres are calcium silicate fibres or 
calcium sulphate fibres.  
 The term "nail lacquer" as used herein includes 
nail varnishes, top coats, base coats, nail hardeners 
and ridge fillers. Nail varnishes commonly contain 
colour pigments and pearlisers to produce an attractive 
cosmetic finish. In contrast, top coats are usually 
clear lacquers which may have a lower resin content and 
relatively high diluent content compared to nail 
varnishes. They are intended to give a fast drying, 
hardened, high gloss finish. Preferred nail varnish 
and top coat compositions according to the invention 
comprise 0.05 to 5%, preferably 0.05 to 2.5%, most 
preferably 0.1 to 1% by weight of inorganic fibres. Base coats, nail hardeners and ridge fillers may be 
clear or pigmented nail lacquer compositions. They may 
contain higher levels of resin than nail varnishes to 
provide a smooth even base film with good adhesion to 
the nail surface and they may also contain agents which 
improve the properties of the nails themselves. 
Preferred base coats, nail hardeners and ridge fillers
