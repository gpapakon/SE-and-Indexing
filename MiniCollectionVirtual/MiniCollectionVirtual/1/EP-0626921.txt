<ABSTRACT>
The container is made from sheets or films of synthetic material. It has two side faces (2) joined by vertical weld seams (7, 8) and a bottom (3) joining said faces, the bottom being folded in a "W" configuration and being joined to the faces (2) by weldings in broken or curvilinear lines (14). According to the invention, the container has a generally cylindrical or truncated configuration. Its upper part (4), made of the same material as the side faces (2), is comprised of a central area (9) wherein is fixed a plug (5, 6). On either side of the central area (9) two substantially triangular areas (10, 11) which form "depressions" between the side faces (2). Said areas (10, 11) are joined at an apex (12, 13) by points of the vertical weldings (7, 8), at a certain distance (d) under the container apex. This container may hold a liquid, viscous or pulverulent product.
