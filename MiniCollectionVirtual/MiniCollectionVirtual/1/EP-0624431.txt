Tooling for the application of an abrasive tape on a
machine used for tape micro-finishing the cylindrical journals

of a component, and more specifically the journals and pins of
crankshafts, incorporating, for each journal (6) to be machined,

a pivoting and vertically mobile arm (1), with three shoes
(7, 8) to apply the abrasive tape, one mounted in the upper

central position of the arm (1), with the two others mounted
laterally in a lower position on two jaws (2a.2b), being

articulated on the arm, in such a way that, when clamped against
the journal (6) to be machined, the three shoes are

approximately positioned at the three points of an equilateral
triangle, whereby each of the three shoes (7, 8) feature a

concave surface for the application of abrasive tape over an
angle higher than 60ยบ and inferior to 120ยบ so that during the

clamping, the three shoes of each arm practically wrap around
completely the journal (6) to be machined, that the upper centre

shoe (7), mounted on the arm (1), is provided with a limited
amount of horizontal translation mobility, perpendicular to the

axis of journal (6), and that each of the two lateral lower
shoes (8a, 8b) is mounted on its jaw (2a, 2b) by means of an

axis (12a, 12b) parallel to the axis of the journal (6), and
having a limited amount of oscillation around axis (12a, 12b).
Tooling in accordance with claim 1, whereby each shoe
(7, 8) incorporates a rigid base (13) and a lining (14) made of

a softer material, with a low friction coefficient. 
Tooling in accordance with claim 2, whereby the lining
(14) is made of vulcanised synthetic rubber.
Tooling in accordance with claims 2 or 3, whereby the
lining (14) incorporates, according to the axis of curvature

several sections (14a, 14b, 14c) of varying hardness increasing
from the centre to each end of the width of the lining.
Tooling in accordance with claim (4) whereby, the lining
(14) incorporates a middle section (14a) of a low hardness,

followed, at either end, by two intermediate sections (14b) of
average hardness, followed again by two end sections(14c) of

higher hardness.
