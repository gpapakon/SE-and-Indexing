<ABSTRACT>
An oral vaccine formulation is provided for stimulation of an immune response in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. The formulation comprises an enzymatically degradable antigen in a hydrogel matrix. In ruminant species, the vaccine formulation, upon oral administration, is formed to pass through the rumen without substantial hydration and then into the post-ruminal portion of the digestive tract where the antigen is released for contact with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIGENSBackground and Summary of the InventionThis invention relates to a method for stimulating a mucosal immune response. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of hydrogels (water swellable, cross-linked polymers) as vehicles for delivering antigens to the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the gut. Mucosal surfaces are the sites of entry of most infectious agents and hosts. Therefore, mucosal immunity is important as the first line of defense against infectious agents. It prevents attachment of pathogens to the mucosal epithelium, neutralizes viruses and bacteria toxins, and allows other aspects of the immune system to phagocytose and remove pathogens from the mucosal site. The mucosa-associated immune system functions to prevent the penetration of microbes into the internal regions of the body. Direct application of antigens to a mucosal surface is the best way to induce a local immune response. However, this is not always possible or practical either because of the handling involved or because the toxicity of the antigens to the mucosal surface. Local immunity can also be induced by the stimulation of the common mucosal immune system (MALT) , a network whereby all mucosal sites are linked to each other immunologically. When the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the gut or lung is exposed to an antigen, lymphocytes migrate to all other mucosal sites and produce antibodies. A population of memory lymphocytes is also induced which provides antibodies at a later time in response to the antigen.The greatest accumulation of lymphoid tissue in MALT and in the body is the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) located in the intestines. These lymphoid tissues 

contain functional T and B lymphocytes and antigen- presenting accessory cells. In contrast to the systemic lymphoid tissues of the body, the B lymphocyte population of GALT includes a significant population of cells which are committed to the synthesis of IgA class antibodies. This antibody type is not effectively induced through conventional intramuscular or subcutaneous immunization. The lymphoid tissue is separated from the lumen of the gut by a layer of epithelial cells which are interspersed with antigen-presenting accessory cells. These specialized cells actively internalize samples from the lumenal space, and pass the samples to the underlying lymphoid cells. Exposure of GALT to antigen compounds triggers the clonal expansion of specific B and T lymphocytes. The IgA committed B lymphoblasts migrate

4. An improved method of orally vaccinating ruminants by stimulating the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with a vaccine said method comprising the step of orally administering a vaccine composition in accordance with claim 1.
5. The improvement of claim 3, wherein the vaccine composition is administered in admixture with animal feed.
6. The improvement of claim 3, wherein the vaccine composition is administered in a bolus dosage form. 


 7. An orally administered vaccine composition comprising a proteolytically degradable antigenic composition, in an amount effective to induce an immune response in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, contained in a swellable hydrogel matrix, said hydrogel matrix formed to facilitate passage through harsh proteolytic environment of the upper digestive tract without substantial hydration.
8. A method of forming the composition of claim 1, said method comprising the steps of forming an aqueous solution comprising the antigenic composition, about 30 to about 50 percent weight of a hydrogel forming monomer or a cross-linkable hydrogel- forming polymer, and about .01 to about 5% of a cross- linking agent, initiating hydrogel formation, and drying the resulting hydrogel-antigen composition. 9.
