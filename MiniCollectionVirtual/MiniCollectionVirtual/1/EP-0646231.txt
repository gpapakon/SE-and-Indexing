<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchange tube (1) comprises, in its formed state, an outer wall (4) surrounding a plurality of internal fins (2) which extend along the length of the tube. The fins (2) and outer wall (4) are formed from a unitary portion of sheet material, the fins comprising respective groups of fins extending from a common longitudinal seam line (3) in mutually opposed directions transverse to the longitudinal direction of the tube and seam. The tube (1) is typically formed by means of a roll forming process in which the groups of fins (2) are initially formed in the sheet or strip and portions of the strip subsequently plastically deformed symmetrically about a longitudinal axis of the sheet or strip to provide the outer wall. Typically the tube is formed from sheet or strip aluminium (or an alloy thereof) and the tube subsequently brazed when formed. The heat exchange tube (1) is suitable for use in vehicle radiators, condensers, oil coolers etc.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat exchanger tube 
comprising the features as indicated in the 
precharacterising part of claim 1 and to a 
method of forming a heat exchange tube. 
A heat exchange tube of this kind is known, for example, 
in EP-A-0 302 232, in which the corrugated insert is formed integrally with the outer wall 
of the tube by means of deformation of a sheet or strip of metal. The heat exchange tube 
disclosed in European patent specification 0302232 is however difficult to produce in practice 
particularly where automated production is required. 
Such heat exchanger tubes are used for heat exchangers such as vehicle radiators, condensers, oil coolers, intercoolers 
and heaters or the like. Heat exchange tubes are arranged to carry therein a first fluid medium whilst 
a second fluid medium is in contact with the exterior of the tube. Where a temperature 
difference exists between the first and second fluid media heat will be transferred between 
the two via the heat conductive walls of the tube. It is known to provide corrugated fins or ribs in the interior of heat exchanger 
tubes to increase the surface area of conductive material available for heat transfer, and/or 
cause turbulence of the fluid carried in the interior of the tube. In both cases, heat transfer 
efficiency is increased. In one known construction a roll formed clad aluminium tube is 
provided with an insert in the form of a sheet of corrugated fins; insertion of the sheet of 
corrugated fin into the tube is extremely difficult and typically achievable only manually due 
to required tight dimensional tolerances between the tube and corrugated fin sheet insert. In 
another known construction, heat exchange tubes are formed by extrusion from aluminium 
billets. In this construction internal ribs are formed during extrusion, however extruded 
tubes are formed from aluminium billet and not clad aluminium, which causes problems 
when attempting to braze the assembled heat exchanger. Furthermore, extruded heat 
exchange tubes are expensive to produce. An improved heat exchange tube has now been devised which alleviates some 
of the above-mentioned difficulties.  
 In accordance with a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a heat exchange 
tube comprising the features according to claim 1. The common longitudinal seam line comprises a line of abutment of respective 
portions of the wall of the tube which are inverted during forming to position the groups of 
fins internally of the tube. Typically the common

A heat exchange tube comprising an outer wall and a plurality of internal fins 
extending longitudinally of the tube, the fins and outer wall being formed from a 

unitary portion of sheet or strip material, each of the fins comprising a respective 
corrugated portion of the sheet or strip material, characterised in that said fins 

comprise first and second series of fins, each series comprising a plurality of fins 
successively spaced in mutually opposed directions, from a common longitudinal seam 

line which opposed directions are transverse to the longitudinal direction of the tube, 
each of said fins being in the interior of the tube with alternating troughs and crests 

in thermally conductive contact with respective opposed portions of an inner face of 
the outer wall.

of the strip or sheet material defining each series of fins are separated from one 

another by interconnecting portions, which interconnecting portions are not provided 
with fins. 
A heat exchange tube according to any preceding claim, wherein the series of fins are 
formed each adjacent a respective longitudinally running peripheral edge of the sheet 

or strip material.

material comprises clad aluminium or clad aluminium alloy. 
A method of forming a heat exchange tube comprising forming respective series of 
fins in respective deformable portions of strip or sheet material, and subsequently 

deforming further portions of the strip or sheet material to provide an outer wall 

surrounding the series of fins, whereby the series of fins extend from a common 
longitudinal seam line in mutually opposed directions which directions are transverse 

to the longitudinal direction of the seam line. 
A method according to claim 8, wherein the strip or sheet material is deformed 
symmetrically about its longitudinal axis to form the heat exchange tube. 
A method according to claim 8 or claim 9, wherein two respective series of fins are 
formed, each in the region of a respective longitudinally running peripheral edge of 

the strip or sheet material.

sheet material are provided with respective series of fins are folded toward one 

another causing intermediate portions of the sheet or strip material to wrap around the 
series of fins thereby providing the outer wall. 
A method according to any of claims 8 to 12, wherein the tube is brazed along the 
seam line to form a joining interface between the respective series of fins.
