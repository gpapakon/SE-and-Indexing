<ABSTRACT>
An air-fuel ratio estimator for estimating 
air-fuel ratio of an air and fuel mixture supplied to an 

internal combustion engine from an output of an air-fuel 
ratio sensor. In the estimator, detection response lag time 

of said air-fuel ratio sensor is approximated as a first-order 
lag time system to produce state equation from said 

first-order lag time system. The state equation is discretized 
for a period delta T to obtain a discretized state 

equation. A transfer function is calculated from the discretized 
state equation and is then an inverse transfer 

function is calculated from said transfer function. And 
correction coefficient of said inverse transfer function is 

determined and multiplying with inverse transfer function to 
the sensor output estimate an air-fuel ratio of an air and 

fuel mixture supplied to the engine. The correction coefficient 
is predetermined with respect to engine speed and is 

made zero at or below a predetermined engine speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air-fuel ratio
estimator for an internal combustion engine, more particularly
to an air-fuel ratio estimator for a multicylinder
internal combustion engine for estimating the air-fuel ratio
from an output of air-fuel ratio sensor with highly accuracy.It is a common practice to install an air-fuel
ratio sensor at the exhaust system confluence point of
an internal combustion engine to detect the air-fuel ratio
at that location. A system of this type is taught by Japanese
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Sho 59(1984)-101,562,
for example.Aside from the above, the applicant earlier
proposed designing a model describing the behavior of the
sensor detection response delay and estimates the input
air-fuel ratio of an air-fuel mixture supplied to the engine
correctly from the output of an air-fuel ratio sensor disposed
at the exhaust system confluence point by adjusting
for the response delay, and then designing another model
describing the behavior of the exhaust system and input the
estimated confluence point air-fuel ratio adjusted for the
response delay to the model, and constructing an observer 
for estimating the air-fuel ratios at the individual cylinders.
(EP-A-553 570).
The sensor used
there is not an O2 sensor which produces an inverted output
only in the vicinity of the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio,
but a wide-range air-fuel ratio sensor which produces a
detection output proportional to the oxygen concentration of
the exhaust gas.In the detection, since the remaining burned
gas in the cylinder is swept out by a piston as the exhaust
gas in the course of an exhaust stroke, the behavior of the
air-fuel ratio at the exhaust system confluence point of a
multicylinder internal combustion engine is conceived to be
synchronous with the Top Dead Center crank position. This
means that the air-fuel ratio sampling through the aforesaid
air-fuel ratio sensor should be conducted synchronizing with
the TDC crank position, i.e. the sampling is not free from
the crank angles of the engine. Since, however, the sampling
interval varies with engine speed, when estimating the
air-fuel ratio using the aforesaid model describing the
behavior of the sensor detection response delay, it may
sometime be difficult to accurately estimate the air-fuel
ratio.An object of the invention is therefore to
overcome the problem and to provide an air-fuel ratio estimator
for an internal combustion engine which enables, using 
the aforesaid model, to adjust for the sensor detection
delay to estimate the
