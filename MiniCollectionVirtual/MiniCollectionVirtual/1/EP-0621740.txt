<ABSTRACT>
A method is shown for uniform and fast heating by means of microwaves which are fed pulse-like into the products, the products to be treated, such as for example chemical or pharmaceutical products or foods, in particular convenience foods, are guided in open or closed microwave-transparent containers on a continuously conveying endless transport belt through a treatment chamber in which feeding channels of microwave generators are arranged aligned perpendicularly or obliquely with respect to the transport belt. The unit is operated at a microwave power profile which reduces the switch-on and switch-off transient of the microwave pulses as well as at an operating frequency of 50 kHz, which has an edge gradient which is smaller than 1 millisecond, and with pulses of largely square-wave amplitude shape and a length which is in the microsecond to millisecond range.

<CLAIMS>
Method of uniformly and rapidly heating by means of 
microwaves supplied to the products in a pulse-like manner, 

wherein the products to be treated, such as chemical or 
pharmaceutical products or ready-to-serve meals for 

example, are guided through a treatment chamber in open or 
sealed containers, which are permeable to microwaves, on a 

continuously operating conveyor system, inlet ducts of 
microwave generators being orientated vertically or 

inclinedly relative to the conveyor belt and being disposed 
in said treatment chamber, the energy outputs of said 

generators being effected in a pulse-like manner and being 
controllable by a computer,
 
characterised in that
 
the system is operated 


a) with a microwave power profile, which shortens the 
inward and downward oscillation ranges of the microwave 

pulses, 
b) with an operating frequency of between 20 and 100, 
preferably between 40 and 80, and especially 50 kHz, said 

frequency having an edge steepness of less than 1 
millisecond, 
c) with pulses having a largely rectangular amplitude shape 
and a length in the micro- to millisecond range.
