<ABSTRACT>
The roof mounting, eg. for a truck roof, has the stepped grooves (4) pressed into the roof running front to rear, to act as drainage ducts. The mounting plates (7) are welded across the first steps to form a recessed fitting with a space under the plates to take the securing thread, or captive nut. The plates are made from zinc-treated metal and are painted with the cab roof. A simple threaded fitting has a hole pressed into each plate leaving a rim under the plate into which the thread can be cut. This eliminates a captive nut. The front- and rear edges of the plates are lipped for increased strength.

<CLAIMS>
Vehicle roof design, particularly for a truck cab, for the attachment of add-on 
components and superstructures, with recesses in the roof shell with 

support faces to which support organs for roof superstructures and add-on 
components are indirectly fitted, characterised in that
 
the recesses (3) are impressed in the roof shell (2),
 
each recess (3) consists of a water drain channel (4) and support faces (5, 

6) located at a higher level on either side of said recess (3),
 
a mounting plate (7) bridging the water drain channel (4) contacts and is 

welded to the two support faces (5, 6) of a recess (3),
 
each mounting plate (7) is perforated by a threaded bore (8) and has a level 

upper side (12) which, in its installation position, projects only slightly if at 
all beyond the roof contour, and that
 
support organs (13, 14) for roof superstructures and/or add-on components 

(16, 17) rest on the upper sides (12) of the mounting plates (7) and can be 
fastened to them by means of mounting bolts (15) that are screwed into the 

threaded bores (8) and reach only into the area of the respective water drain 
channel (4) without contacting the roof shell. 
Vehicle roof design according to Claim 1, characterised in that, in the 
vehicle's longitudinal axis, the mounting plates (7) have downward curving 

portions (9, 10) at front and rear that reach into the area of the water drain 
channel (4) and serve to reinforce the structure. 
Vehicle roof design according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised 
in that the support organs (13, 14) are designed so that the mounting plates 

(7), as viewed in the vehicle's longitudinal axis, are positively overlapped at 
the top front and rear. 
Vehicle roof design according to one of the foregoing Claims, characterised 
in that the mounting plates (7) are made of galvanised sheet metal 

pressings.  
 
Vehicle roof design according to Claim 4, characterised in that, in the 
closed-die press forming process for the mounting plate (7), a core hole 

with a downward projecting bead rim (11) is pressed into the mounting 
plate (7) to form a passage-type threaded bore (8), and that a passage 

thread is then cut into said core hole that has thus been extended.
