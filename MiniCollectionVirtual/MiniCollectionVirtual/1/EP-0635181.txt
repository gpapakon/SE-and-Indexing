<ABSTRACT>
The process is designed to discover whether the data sent from the transmitter (SE) to the receiver (EM) have been tapped and subsequently fed back in and/or altered without authority. To this end the signature (S) allocated to the useful data (D) is symmetrically coded using a combination of coupling data (K) characterising the coupling between the transmitter and the receiver and random data (Z) provided by a random generator. The coupling data are transmitted uncoded, while the random data are coded. It is possible at the reception end to detect whether the message transmitted has been tapped and fed back into the system if the coupling data are incorrect. An alteration to the transmitted message can be detected in that the code used to encode the signature, which is obtained from a combination of coupling data and random data with the aid of a one-way function, does not correspond to the code obtained at the receiver during decoding and thus the decoding of the encoded signature gives an incorrect result. This is recognised on verification of the signature.

Process for detecting unauthorized reinjection of 
any data transmitted by a transmitter (SE) to a receiver 

(EM), 

in which the data comprise useful data (D) and a 
signature (S) developed from the useful data, 
in which the signature (S) is symmetrically enciphered 
and the key (E) used for this purpose is formed as a 

function of coupling data (K) which contain information 
about the transmission procedure. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the coupling 
data (K) are dependent on the time of transmission of the 

data and/or on the receiver. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which the 
coupling data (K) are transmitted in plain text to the 

receiver (EM). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which 
the key (E) is additionally influenced at the transmitter 

(SE) by random data or pseudo-random data (Z). 
Process according to Claim 4, in which the random 
data (Z) are transmitted to the receiver (EM) in 

enciphered form with a transfer key (T). 
Process according to Claim 5, 

in which the random data (Z) are generated, 
in which the coupling data (K) are established, 
in which a symmetric key (E) is generated by one-way 
enciphering of the combination of random data and coupling 

data, 
in which the signature (S) is enciphered with the aid 
of the key (E), 
in which the random data (Z) are enciphered with the  
 

transfer key (T), 
in which a message comprising the useful data (D), the 
enciphered signature (S/E), the coupling data (K) and the 

enciphered random data (Z/T) is transmitted. 
Process according to Claim 6, in which the coupling 
data (K) are checked on the receiver side and, if there 

is a discrepancy, the message is rejected, 

in which the random data (Z) are recovered by deciphering 
with the transfer key (T) the enciphered random data 

(Z/T) obtained, 
in which the symmetric key (E) is determined by one-way 
enciphering of the combination of the calculated random 

data (Z) and coupling data (K) obtained, 
in which the signature (S) is recovered by deciphering 
the enciphered signature (S/E) with the aid of the 

calculated key (E), 
in which the signature (S) is checked and, if errors 
are established, the message is rejected. 
Process according to one of Claims 5 to 7, in which 
a symmetric key is used as the transfer key (T). 
Process according to one of Claims 5 to 7, in which 
an asymmetric key is used as the transfer key (T), 

proceeding on the basis of the public-key method. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, in 
which the signature is replaced by a check sum of the 

useful data. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, in 
which the useful data are replaced by protocol data or a 

combination of protocol data and useful data.
