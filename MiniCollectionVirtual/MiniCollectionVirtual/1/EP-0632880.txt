<ABSTRACT>
A micromechanical sensor has a plurality of sensing elements (14a-14d) which are supported at respective support regions (12a-12d). A first set of the sensing elements defines the sensing gap. In one arrangement this is defined by sensing elements supported by adjacent support regions. In another embodiment the sensing gap is defined between one sensing element and a reference beam formed by connection of the return legs of two diametrically opposed sensing elements. The sensing elements are substantially similar one to another and each sensing element comprises an outgoing elongate leg extending away from its associated support region and a return leg substantially parallel to the outgoing leg extending towards the support region. By providing sensing elements which are substantially similar in shape and arranged in this way, the effects of thin film stress are minimised.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a micromechanical sensor, and 
particularly to an electromicromechanical sensor. There exist several fabrication techniques specifically for 
manufacturing micromechanical structures. These techniques 
fall broadly into two categories: bulk micromachining and 
surface micromachining. Bulk micromachining involves 
sculpting a silicon substrate by means of chemical etchants 
whilst surface micromachining involves the use of deposition 
of thin films on a silicon substrate. Bulk micromachining is a proven high volume production 
technique used to fabricate structures with precisely 
determined critical dimensions. However, surface-micromachined 
sensors have the advantage of being significantly smaller than 
bulk-micromachined sensors. Since film thicknesses on the 
surface of a silicon wafer can be as many as 100 times smaller 
than the thickness of a wafer itself, surface-micromachined 
parts can be an order of magnitude smaller than bulk-micromachined 
parts. Futhermore, surface-micromachining techniques 
which involve the deposition and etching of films are more 
compatible with conventional integrated circuit manufacture 
processes. Surface micromachining has been used to manufacture an 
accelerometer which is described in the technology section of 
Electronic World News of 9th September 1991. There have also 
been attempts to make sensors comprising free-standing micro 
structures, such as beams, which can be deflected 
electrostatically towards and away from other parts of the 
micro structure so as to control the size of a gap. There is currently a desire to integrate sensors onto silicon 
integrated circuit chips to reduce fabrication costs, increase 
the reliability and to miniaturize the sensors as far as 
possible.  
 Published International Patent Application No. WO-A1-9203740, describes a 
sensor having polysilicon capacitive elements, one being relatively displaceable with 
respect to the other such that, upon relative displacement, overall capacitance increases or 
decreases.  
 The current proposals for surface-micromachined sensors all suffer from a common 
difficulty and that is the existence of stresses which arise in the thin films which constitute 
the suspended elements of the micro structures. These stresses can cause suspended 
elements of the micro structure to bend and twist out of the plane in which the gap is 
defined. This has at least two disadvantages. In the first place, there is no longer control 
over the size of the gap since it could now
