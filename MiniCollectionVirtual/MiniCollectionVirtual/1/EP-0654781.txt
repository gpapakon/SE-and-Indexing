<ABSTRACT>
In a speaker verification system, a method of compensating for 
differences in speech samples obtained during registration and those obtained during 

verification due to the use of different types of microphones is provided by filtering 
at least one of the samples such that the similarities of the two samples are increased. 

The filtered sample is used within the speaker verification matching process. A 
two-way comparison is disclosed in which both a verification speech sample and a 

reference sample are filtered with nonlinear microphone characteristics such as 
carbon microphone characteristics. A four-way comparison is also disclosed in 

which patterns produced from unfiltered verification and reference samples and 
patterns produced from the filtered verification and reference samples are compared 

to identify a match. A score is determined for each comparison. The comparison 
having the best score is used to determine if a match has occurred.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is generally directed to speaker verification, and
more particularly, to a method of accommodating variability among different types
of telephone handsets, in order to improve the accuracy of speaker verification.Speaker Verification (SV) is a speaker-dependent pattern-matching
process in which a subscriber's speech sample presented for verification is processed
to produce a verification pattern. This verification pattern is compared to an SV
reference pattern that is typically produced from speech samples previously provided
in the course of a so-called registration session. A "match" between the verification
and reference patterns occurs when their characteristics are substantially similar.
Otherwise, a "mismatch" is said to have occurred.A typical application of SV is a telephony-based security system. A
subscriber "registers" with the system by providing speech samples over a telephone
link and an SV reference pattern is produced. Subsequently, a caller, seeking access
to, for example, a service or some secure data, calls the system and presents his/her
speech sample for verification as described above. If a match occurs, the desired
access is granted. If there is a mismatch, it is presumed that a so-called
imposter--pretending
to be a subscriber--was the caller and access is denied.Many times, SV is complicated by the fact that the verification pattern is
different from the SV reference pattern due to circumstances such as, illustratively,
the use of different types of telephone handset microphones, e.g., linear (such as
electret) and non-linear (such as carbon). Other examples include different
background noises and different speaking levels. These differences can cause
characteristics of the speech sample provided during registration and the speech
sample provided during any particular SV verification session to be different from
one another. The corresponding patterns will then also be different, possibly
resulting in an incorrect "mismatch" determination.In particular, an electret microphone performs a fairly linear
transformation on incoming speech samples and, as such, minimally distorts them. A
carbon microphone, on the other hand, performs a non-linear transformation on the
speech samples by, for example, compressing high-volume speech levels and
suppressing low background noise levels, the latter often being referred to in the art
as "enhancement." As such, the carbon microphone distorts the speech samples to a 
significant extent. Because of the variability in the
