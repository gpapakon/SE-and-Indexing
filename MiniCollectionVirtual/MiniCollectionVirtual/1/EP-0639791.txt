<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel, heat-developable photothermographic 
elements and in particular, it relates to photothermographic elements containing 
photographically useful materials with silyl blocking groups. Silver halide-containing, photothermographic imaging materials (i.e., heat-developable 
photographic materials) processed with heat, and without liquid 
development, have been known in the art for many years. These materials, also 
known as "dry silver" compositions or emulsions, generally comprise a support 
having coated thereon: (1) a photosensitive material that generates atomic silver 
when irradiated, (2) a non-photosensitive, reducible silver source, and (3) a 
reducing agent for the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source, and (4) a 
binder. The photosensitive material is generally photographic silver halide which 
must be in catalytic proximity to the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source. 
Catalytic proximity requires an intimate physical association of these two materials 
so that when silver specks or nuclei are generated by the irradiation or light 
exposure of the photographic silver halide, those nuclei are able to catalyze the 
reduction of the reducible silver source. It has long been understood that 
elemental silver (Ag°) is a catalyst for the reduction of silver ions, and a 
progenitor of the photosensitive photographic silver halide may be placed into 
catalytic proximity with the non-photosensitive, reducible silver source in a 
number of different fashions, such as by partial metathesis of the reducible silver 
source with a halogen-containing source (see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 
3,457,075), coprecipitation of silver halide and reducible silver source material 
(see, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,839,049), and other methods that intimately  
 
associate the photosensitive photographic silver halide and the non-photosensitive, 
reducible silver source. The non-photosensitive, reducible silver source is a material that contains 
silver ions. The preferred non-photosensitive reducible silver source comprises 
silver salts of long chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, typically having from 10 to 30 
carbon atoms. The silver salt of behenic acid or mixtures of acids of similar 
molecular weight are generally used. Salts of other organic acids or other organic 
materials, such as silver imidazolates, have been proposed, and U.S. Patent No. 
4,260,677 discloses the use of complexes of inorganic or organic silver salts as 
non-photosensitive, reducible silver
