<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining whether a particular sample vial has bacterial 
growth includes the steps of introducing a first light into the sample vial and 

measuring the intensity of the reemerging light. One then introduces a second 
light which is different from the first light and has either a different wavelength, 

or is introduced at a different location than the first light. The reemerging 
intensity from the second light is also measured. A ratio quantity is calculated 

based on the two reemerging intensities, and the calculated ratio is compared 
to expected ratios for both positive and negative samples. It has been found 

that a comparison of the reemerging light intensities provides a very good 
indication of whether a particular sample is a positive or negative sample. 

Various methods and formulas for calculating the ratios may be utilized. 
Graphs associated with the particular methods and formulas are developed 

experimentally to allow one to compare a particular calculated ratio value to 
expected values for positive and negative cultures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to a blood culture sensor station which directs 
two sources of light into a blood culture specimen, measures the reemerging 
light from both light sources, calculates a ratio based on the two reemerging 
lights, and determines whether the specimen includes bacteria based on the 
calculated ratio. Typically, the presence of bacteria in a patient's body fluid is determined 
by injecting a small quantity of body fluid (usually blood) into a vial which 
contains a culture medium. Various types of instruments are utilized to monitor 
changes in the carbon dioxide content of the vial. Carbon dioxide is a metabolic 
by-product of bacteria growth, and thus an increase in carbon dioxide in the vial 
indicates the presence of bacteria in the patient's body fluid. Sensors have typically been inserted into the vial to test the carbon 
dioxide content. These so-called invasive sensors are somewhat undesirable due 
to the risk of cross-contamination. Non-invasive sensor systems have been 
developed which utilize chemical sensors disposed inside the vial. Typically, 
such sensors respond to changes in the carbon dioxide concentration by changing 
color, or by changing their fluorescent intensity. To monitor changes in the 
known chemical sensors, the systems have typically required one light source, 
one spectral exitation filter, one emission filter and one photodetector arranged 
adjacent to each vial. Each of these components must have extremely narrow 
specification tolerances to avoid substantial station to station sensitivity 
variations. However, even if it were possible to equalize all of the vial stations, 
certain lot-to-lot variations in the chemical sensor composition and certain vial-to-vial 
geometry variations may remain. Thus, the accuracy of such system is 
sometimes in question.  Some disadvantages of intensity based sensors can be overcome by 
utilizing fluorescent sensors which change fluorescent lifetime with changing pH, 
carbon dioxide concentrations, oxygen concentration, or other parameters. Such 
fluorescent lifetime sensors typically require expensive equipment. Further, 
color changing or fluorescent chemical sensors have typically required a certain 
temperature adaption time before a first vial test can be performed. Thus, a test 
cannot be made immediately upon receiving a vial when utilizing known 
chemical sensors. It has been proposed to direct a light source into a vial, and monitor the 
reemerging light over time. It has been shown that increased carbon
