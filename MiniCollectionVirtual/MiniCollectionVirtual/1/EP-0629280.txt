<ABSTRACT>
In this system, an absorption solution consisting of a common salt and water is circulated through the Immediate Heat Upgrading Absorption (IHUA) air handlers (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d) to upgrade heat taken from a first air mass or water and release the upgraded heat to a second air mass immediately. Production of chilled water is avoided. An IHUA air handler (1a, 1b, 1c, 1d) has one or more Modular Evaporation-Absorption Panels or heat pipe assemblies with two sets of heat transfer fin assemblies. An E-A panel or E-A heat pipe assembly has a film evaporative zone and a film absorption zone that respectively exchange heat with air to be cooled and air to be heated through the two sets of fin assemblies. An IHUA system can also provide cool thermal storage by storing water and absorbing solutions. IHUA system can be used in air conditioning buildings and moving vehicles.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Immediate Heat Upgrading Air Conditioning Systemand Associated Cool Thermal Storage1. Field of the Invention (Technical Field):The processes and apparatus of the present invention are related to (a) air conditioning with heat upgrading by an absorption operation and (b) cool thermal storage that can be charged during off peak hours of po der consumption and be discharged to provide air conditioning during peak hours of power consumption.2.Background Art:Since Immediate Heat Upgrading Absorption Air Conditioning Systems ( IHUA Systems of the present invention can provide air conditioning by absorption for big areas and small areas and can also provide cool thermal storages by storing water and concentrated absorbing solutions, prior art on (a) absorption air conditioning, and (b) cool thermal storage are reviewed in the following:2A. Absorption Air Conditioning• A large scale absorption air conditioning process comprises (a) a step of producing a stream of chilled liquid such as water or an aqueous solution of ethylene glycol at around 7.2°C (45°F), in an absorption liquid chiller and (b) a step of circulating a stream of the chilled liquid through air handlers to remove heat from indoor air and thereby return the liquid at around 15.5°C(16 °F). Manufacturers of absorption chillers are Trane Corp. in Wisconsin and Carrier Corp. in New York State. There are several manufacturers in Japan includint Mitsubishi and Yasaki. A commercial absorption liquid chiller has a large vacuum enclosure enclosing (a) an evaporation zone, (b) an 

absorption zone, (c) a regeneration zone and (d) a condensation zone. The processing steps are as follows:(a) As water enters the evaporation zone, flash vaporization causes formation of a first vapor and mass of internal chilled water at around 4.4°C (40°F). An external chill water at a first temperature around 15.5°C (60°F) then exchange heat with the internal chill water thereby cooled to a second temperature at around 7.2°C (45°F). The chilled external chill water is then circulated to air handlers and heated to the first temperature and returned to he liquid chiller;(b) The water vapor is drawn to the absorption zone and is absorbed in a strong absorbing solution such as 65 % equeous lithium bromide solution. The absorbing solution is thereby diluted and becomes a weak absorbing solution, say 60 % lithium bromide. The heat of absorption is released to a cooling water stream;(c) The weak absorbing solution then enters the regeneration zone, wherein it is heated and vaporized
