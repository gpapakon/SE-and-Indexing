<ABSTRACT>
An arithmetic logic unit (230) may be divided into a 
plurality of sections (301, 302, 303, 340), each of which 

forms an output of respective subsets of the input inputs. A 
status detector generates a single bit status signal from the 

output of each section that is stored in a flags register 
(211). These status signals may indicate a zero output or a 

carry output. The flags register (211) preferably includes 
more bits than the maximum number of sections of the 

arithmetic logic unit (230). New status signals may overwrite 
the previous status signals or the flags register may rotate 

the stored bits and store the new status signals. A status 
register (210) stores a size indicator that determines the a 

number of sections of the arithmetic logic unit (230). The 
flags register (211) stores a number of status signals 

corresponding to the number of sections. The status detector 
has a zero detector (321, 322, 323, 324) for each elementary 

section (301, 302, 303, 304) of the arithmetic logic unit 
(230). When there are fewer than the maximum number of 

sections, these zero signals are ANDed (331, 332, 341) for 
plural elementary sections. A multiplexer (311, 312, 313, 

314) between a carry-out of each elementary section (301, 302, 
303, 304) and a carry-in of an adjacent elementary section 

(301, 302, 303, 304) couples the carry-out to the carry-in or 
not depending on the selected number of sections. The status 

detector supplies carry outs from each elementary section 
(301, 302, 303, 304) not coupled to an adjacent elementary 

(301, 302, 303, 304) section via a corresponding multiplexer 
(311, 312, 313, 314) to the flags register (211). Status 

signals stored in the flags register (211) influence the 
combination of inputs formed by the arithmetic logic unit 

(230) within corresponding sections. Selected bits of flags 
register (211) are expanded via an expand circuit (238) to  

 
form a third input to a three input arithmetic logic unit 

(230). Preferably the arithmetic logic unit (230) and the 
flags register (235) are embodied in at least one digital 

image/graphics processor (71) as a part of a multiprocessor 
(100) formed in a single integrated circuit used in image 

processing.
