<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of, and methods to obtain, ion exchanger complexes with psychotropic drugs for reducing toxic side effects and lethality when overdosing the drug. The invention includes methods and compositions for modifying the total amount of drug released from the complex in the gastro-intestinal tract by adding a substance which affects the ion exchange process.

<DESCRIPTION>
 New drug formulations with ion-exchangersField of inventionThe present invention relates to a the use of ion exchange complexes in medicine to avoid or substantially reduce toxicity and lethality if overdosing ■ psychotropic drugs as well as a method for manufacturing of pharmaceutical preparations thereof including methods to adjust the preparations to suit drugs with different therapeutic dose levels.Background of the inventionPsychotropic drugs represents a special safety problem as the patients due to their psychological disorders are more prone to accidential or deliberate overdosing than other groups of patients. Most of the drugs used in the treat¬ ment of severe depressions are for example potentially lethal in doses that are available to patients with a high risk of suicide.Table 1 , obtained from the data system SWEDIS covering the Swedish market, may serve as an example to illustrate that deaths from overdosage of psychotropic drugs are a common problem.The risk of suicide with antidepressants have, for example, been discussed in detail by Montgomery et al. (S.A. Montgomery, M.T. Lambert and S.P.J. Lynch, The Risk of Suicide with Antidepressants, International clinical psychopharmacology, Suppl. 2, 15-24, 1988) including mortality rates and problems associated with treatment of patients who have episodes of deliberate self-harm due to depression or personality disorders. Psychotropic agents can be divided in different groups such as antidepres¬ sants, antipsychotic agents, anxiolytic agents and, hypnotic and sedative agents. Significant toxic effects of antidepressant agents of the tricyclic or tetracyclic type such as clomipramine, imipramine, amipramine, desipramine, nortriptyline, dothiepin or maprotline are, for example, relatively common and estimates of prevalence have run as high as 5 % (adapted from Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Seventh Edition, Macmillan Publishing Comp., New York, 1985). Clinical consequences of the antimuscarin effects are e.g. dry mouth, epigastrial distress, constipation, dizziness, tachycardia, palpitation, blurred vision and urinary retention. In addition tricyclic antidepressive agents may give rise to manic reactions and cases of confusion and delirium are common especially among elderly patients. 

 Acute poisoning with tricyclic and tefracyclic antidepressants is common and often life threatening. Patients suffering from severe depression have a high risk of suicide and have often access to potentially lethal doses of

Claims
1. A composition for preventing overdosing of a psychotropic drug by modifying its release rate containing a therapeutically effective amount of the psychotropic drug compiexed to an ion exchanger mixed with an additional substance which affects the amount available ions for ion exchange.
2. A composition according to claim 1 characterized In that the 
•
additional substance is a salt which generates an ion with higher or
•
 similar affinity to the ion .exchanger when compared to the drug.
3. A composition according to claim 1 characterized in that the additional substance is a counter ion in an additional complex with an ion exchanger and that the counter ions have less or similar affinity to the ion- exchangers when compared to the drug.
4. A composition according to claims 1-3 characterized in that the ion exchanger is chosen among cationic natural or synthetic polymers such as carrageenans and crosslinked sulphonated polystyrenes.
5. A composition according to claims 1-4 characterized in that the drug has an ionizable amino group.
6. A composition according to claims 3-5 characterized in that the counter ions in the additional complex are biologically inert amines.
7. A composition according to claims 1-6 characterized in that the complexes of the psychotropic drug and an ion exchanger are complexes between tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants having an ionizable amino group and ion exchangers chosen among cationic natural or synthetic polymers such as carrageenans and crosslinked sulphonated polystyrenes. •
8. A complex between an ion exchanger and a tricyclic or a tetracyclic antidepressant having an ionizable aminogroup and carrageenans. 


9. A complex according to claim 8 charecterized in that the antidepressants are clomipramine, imipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, nortriptyline, dothiepin or maprotiline.
10. A process for preparing the complexes according to claims 8-9 characterized by that a solution of the drug is mixed with the solid ion- exchanger.
1 1. An oral pharmaceutical composition containing any of the complexes or compositions according to claims 1 -10 and pharmacologically acceptable excipients.
12. A process for preparing the compositions according to claims 1 -7 and 11 characterized in that complexes of a psychotropic drug and ion exchanger is formed by mixing a solution of the drug with the solid ion exchanger, which complexes are mixed with the additional substances according to claim 1 and in that this mixture thereafter optionally is combined with pharmacologically acceptable excipents.
13. Method for reducing toxic side-effects and lethality when orally over¬ dosing a psychotropic drug characterized by that the drug is complexed to an ion exchanger.
14. Method according to claim 13 wherein the complex of drug and ion exchanger is mixed with an additive which modifies the release of the complexed drug.
15. Method according to claim 14 wherein said additive is a salt which generates an ion with higher or similar affinity to the ion exchanger when compared to the drug.
16. Method according to claim 14 wherein said additive is an additional coπ plex of an ion exchanger and a counter ion, which counter ion has less or similar affinity to the ion exchangers when compared to the drug.
17. Method according to any of claims 13-16 wherein the ion exchanger is chosen among cationic natural or synthetic polymers such as carrageenans and crosslinked sulphonated polystyrenes. 


 18. Method according to any claims 13-17 wherein the drug is a psychotropic drug having an ionizable aminogroup.
19. Method according to any of claims 16-18 wherein the counter ions in the additional complex are biologically inert amines.
20. Method according to any of claims 13-19 wherein the ion exchanger is a carrageenan.
21. Method according to any of claims 18-20 wherein the drug is a tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressant.
22. Use of an ion exchanger for reducing toxic side-effects and lethality when orally overdosing a psychotropic drug characterized by that the drug is complexed to the ion exchanger.
23. Use according to claim 22 wherein the ion exchanger is chosen among cationic natural or synthetic polymers such as carrageenans and crosslinked sulphonated polystyrenes.
24. Use according to claim 23 wherein the drug is a psychotropic drug having an ionizable aminogroup.
25. Use according to claims 23-24 wherein the ion exchanger is a carrageenan.
26. Use according to claims 22-25 wherein the drug is a tricyclic or a tetra¬ cyclic antidepressant.
27. Use of an ionizable drug complexed to an ion exchanger for the preparation of a medicament which reduces the toxic side-effects and lethality when orally overdosing the medicament.
