<ABSTRACT>
The subject-matter of the invention is a folded package (1) preferably for sheet-like articles which are stacked congruently one above the other and are approximately sector-shaped in contour, for example filter paper inserts (4) for coffee machines or teamakers. The object of the invention is to provide a folded package (1) which can be produced inexpensively, is convenient to open up for removal of all the articles and can also be completely closed again. This is achieved in that the folded package (1) is produced from an integral, essentially square blank of paper or a similar, dimensionally stable, foldable material, which blank is folded in from two mutually opposite corners, extending in the manner of a wrapping around the stack of articles to be packaged. The folding-in takes place in such a way that a pocket (5) which envelopes the stack of articles on all sides is formed on one wrapping side and a lid flap (8) is formed on the opposite side, which lid flap can be fixed in relation to the pocket (5) by means of a reusable closure device (10). The lid flap (8) is stabilised by the connection of individual folding layers (9) in such a way that the lid flap (8) automatically assumes its original shape when closed again.

A folding package for articles which are preferably in sheet 
form and stacked in mutually aligned superposed relationship and which 

are approximately sector-shaped in plan view, such as for example filter 
paper inserts for coffee-making or tea-making machines, characterised in 

that the folding package (1) is made from a one-piece, substantially 
square blank (2) of paper or a material which can be similarly folded in 

such a manner as to be stable in respect of shape, which is folded in 
starting from two oppositely disposed corners (3) in the manner of a hem 

around the stack of articles to be packaged, in such a way that there is 
formed at one hem side a packet (5) which is secured by joining the 

corresponding hem portions (7) and formed on the opposite side is a cover 
flap (8) which completely covers over the access opening (6) of the 

pocket and which can be fixed by way of a re-closure means (10) relative 
to the packet (5), wherein individual fold layers (9) of the cover flap 

(8) are joined together for stabilising the shape thereof so that the 
cover flap (8) can be pivoted open sufficiently far for removing 

individual layers of articles (4) from the packet but is automatically 
pivotable back into its closed position again from the opened position. 
A folding package according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the blank (2) comprises a plastics foil or paper which is partially or 

completely coated with heat-sealing medium. 
A folding package according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised 
in that the hem portions (7) and the fold layers (9) are glued 

together. 
A folding package according to claim 3 characterised in that 
glue, hot-melt adhesive or other adhesive agents are applied to the hem 

portions (7) or the fold layer (9) for the glueing operation. 
A folding package according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the cover flap (8) is connected to the  

 
pocket (5) outside the operative region of the re-closure means (10) by 

way of an adhesive point (11) which is effective until the package is 
opened for the first time. 
A folding package according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the re-closure means (10) comprises an 

adhesive strip (10) fixed to the cover flap (8).
