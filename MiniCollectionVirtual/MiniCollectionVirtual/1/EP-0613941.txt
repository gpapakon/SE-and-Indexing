<ABSTRACT>
Fluorosilicone lubricants comprise (A) a 
linear and/or cyclic polydiorganosiloxane containing at 

least one silicon-bonded perfluoroalkylethyl radical 
with at least four perfluorinated carbon atoms, and an 

additive selected from 1) heat stabilizers that are 
reaction products of cerium compounds and alkali metal 

silanolates or organopolysiloxanes with aminophenoxy or 
naphthylaminophenoxy groups and 2) powdered 

fluororesins as cold temperature additives.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorosilicone 
lubricant compositions exhibiting excellent lubricating 
properties in addition to a high level of resistance to 
heat or cold. Silicone lubricants based on dimethylsilicone 
oil or methylphenylsilicone oil have a resistance to 
heat and cold in addition to friction properties that 
are superior to those of organic oil-based lubricants. 
For example, the dynamic coefficient of friction for 
dimethylsilicone oil lubricants is 0.2. Thus, silicone 
lubricants are useful in a variety of applications. Recently, a number of proposals have been 
made that suggest the blending of heat stabilizers into 
the these silicone lubricants for the purposes of 
improving their heat resistance. (Japanese Patent 
Publications [KOKAI] Sho 51-41046 [41,046/1976], and 
Sho 60-106891 [106,891/1985]. On the other hand, fluorosilicone lubricants 
based on 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl-containing silicone oils 
have a solvent resistance and boundary lubricating 
characteristics superior to the heretofore known 
silicone lubricants and as a result are used as 
lubricants in specialty applications. However, the above-described fluorosilicone 
lubricants have a poor heat resistance. Thus, when 
subjected to use at elevated temperatures, the 
3,3,3-trifluoropropyl-containing silicone oil 
depolymerizes, resulting in a substantial deterioration 
in the lubricating properties of this type of 
fluorosilicone lubricant. In response to this, 
Japanese Patent Publication [KOKAI] Hei 3-143997 
[143,997/1991] discloses a fluorosilicone lubricant 
that consists of a 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl-containing 
silicone oil and the anilinophenoxy(ornaphthylaminophenoxy)-containing  
 
organopolysiloxane of Japanese 
Patent Publication [KOKAI] Sho 60-106891. Even so, the 
resultant fluorosilicone lubricant still has an 
unsatisfactory heat resistance. Moreover, the heat 
resistance also remains inadequate in the case of 
fluorosilicone lubricant consisting of 
3,3,3-trifluoropropyl- containing silicone oil and the 
reaction product proposed in Japanese Patent 
Publication [KOKAI] Sho 51-41046. With the goal of further improving the 
lubricating properties of silicone lubricants, a number 
of silicone lubricants thickened with fluororesin 
powder, such as polytetrafluoroethylene powder, have 
also been proposed (Japanese Patent Publications 
[Kokai] Sho 54-163277 [163,277/1979]; Sho 54-49460 
[49,460/1979]; Sho 57-34135 [34,135/1982]; and Sho 
62-190290 [190,290/1987]). Fluorosilicone lubricants composed of this 
type of
