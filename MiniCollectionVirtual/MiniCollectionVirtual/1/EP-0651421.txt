<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an improved color 
picture tube (8) having a viewing screen (22) and a shadow mask 

(24) mounted adjacent to the screen. The mask has an apertured 
contoured portion (26) and a peripheral skirt (30). The 

improvement comprises the skirt having a reverse bend therein, 
wherein a first portion of the skirt that connects with the 

apertured contoured portion extends away from the screen and a 
second portion of the skirt more remote from the apertured 

contoured portion extends towards the screen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to color picture tubes having
shadow masks therein, and particularly to such tubes having
shadow masks made from materials having low coefficients of
thermal expansion, such as iron-nickel alloys.A color picture tube includes an electron gun for
forming and directing three electron beams to a screen of the
tube. The screen is located on the inner surface of a faceplate of
the tube and comprises an array of elements of three different
color emitting phosphors. An apertured mask, called a shadow
mask, is interposed between the gun and the screen to permit
each electron beam to strike only the phosphor elements
associated with that beam.The shadow mask is a thin sheet of metal, such as AK
steel or an iron-nickel alloy, that is contoured to somewhat
parallel the inner surface of the tube faceplate. The shadow mask
includes a large central apertured portion, a solid border portion
surrounding the apertured portion, and a peripheral skirt portion.
The skirt portion is angled from the other portions of the mask
and is usually welded to a peripheral frame that supports the
mask within the faceplate panel of the tube.To make the shadow mask, a flat sheet of metal is
etched to form the apertures, which are usually elongated slots or
circular holes. Thereafter, the sheet is formed into the desired
contour, such as spherical or biradial, and a skirt is formed by
sweeping back the peripheral edge of the sheet. When a mask is
cold-formed out of AK steel, a certain amount of springback occurs
in the apertured portion of the mask, and the skirt flares slightly
outwardly. For a 27V tube, this skirt flare can be about 4.5°.
When an iron-nickel alloy, such as Invar (36% nickel-TM Reg.
#63,970), is cold-formed into a mask contour, the springback and
skirt flare are considerably greater than they are in the same size
AK steel mask. For a 27V tube with an Invar mask, the skirt flare
is about 18.8°. The springback and skirt flare in Invar masks are
caused by the residual stresses that are created in the masks
when they are formed into their contours. In the prior art, these
residual stresses are at least partially controlled by hot-forming, 
instead of cold forming, the masks. One hot forming method is described in U.S.
Patent 4,536,226, issued to Ohtake et al. on August 20, 1985. In the method
disclosed in that patent, a flat mask is first annealed at a temperature in the
range of 1173°K to 1473°K. Then, the mask is pressed into a domed contour
at a temperature in the range of 298°K to 473°K. This

<CLAIMS>
A color picture tube having a viewing screen and a shadow mask
mounted adjacent to said screen, said mask having an apertured

contoured portion and a peripheral skirt surrounding said apertured
countoured portion, and said mask being made of an iron-nickel alloy,

characterized by said mask being cold-formed,

   said skirt (30) having a reverse bend therein, wherein a first
portion of said skirt that connects with said apertured contoured portion

(26) extends away from said screen (22) and a remaining second portion
of said skirt extends toward said screen, said skirt having a cross-sectional

U shape, with the open end of the U facing said screen, said
first portion of said skirt forming approximately half of said U and said

second portion of said skirt forming the approximaterly other half of said
U, said second portion of said skirt locking in stresses in said first portion

of said skirt resulting from the cold-forming of said mask (24).
A method of cold-forming a shadow mask, for use in a color
picture tube, from a flat shadow mask made of an iron-nickel alloy and

including an apertured portion and a peripheral skirt, comprising the steps
of :


a) clamping said skirt of said flat shadow mask (56),
b) doming said apertured portion into a contoured shape (26),
c) bending a first portion of said skirt in a first direction
, said first portion being connected with said apertured

contoured portion,
d) releasing said clamped skirt, and
e) bending a remaining second portion of said skirt in a second
direction that is opposite to said first direction,

so that said skirt has a cross-sectional U shape, with
the open end of the U directed opposite to the apertured

contoured portion,
whereby stresses existing

in said first portion of said skirt are locked by a reverse bend in said skirt (30)
formed between said first and said second portions of said skirt of the

cold-formed shadow mask (24).
