<CLAIMS>
A device for end shaping of tubular workpieces with 
different diameters, characterized by 


a) a revolvingly driven abrasive belt (2), the front 
deflection roll (4) of which corresponds to the diameter 

of the shaped portion (A), 
b) a set of deflection rolls (4, 4a) of different diameters, 
c) a support (3) supporting and fixing the tube (R) to be 
shaped on a longitudinal slide (14) in a clamping device 

(18), which support (3) is capable of being brought up to 
the front deflection roll (4) of the abrasive belt, 
d) two front housing cheeks (25, 26) comprising receptacles 
(27, 28; 45, 46) for replaceable mounting of the front 

deflection roll (4, 4a), from which receptacles (27, 28; 
45, 46), after loosening of the revolving abrasive belt 

(2), a deflection roll (4) may be easily removed and 
another deflection roll (4a) of a different diameter may 

be easily inserted. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the receptacles (45, 46) are constructed as U-shaped members 

and in that on the shafts of the deflection rolls (4, 4a) 
there are arranged bearing races (47) which may be inserted 

into the receptacles (45, 46). 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the bearing races (47) are constructed as ball bearing races.  

 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the mounting for the front deflection roll (4, 4a) is formed 

of 

a) two housing cheeks (25, 26) which are carried by the 
machine frame (38) and of which at least one is formed as 

a fork (27), the other comprising a bore (28), 
b) two bearing wheels (29, 30; 31, 32) associated with the 
bore (28) and the fork (27) respectively and being 

capable of coming to rest on bearing races (33) of the 
shaft (39) of the deflection roll (
4, 4a). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the support (3) is constructed as a cruciform support and 

additionally carries a cross slide (16) arranged displaceably 
on the longitudinal slide (14). 
A device according to claim 1 or claim 5, 
characterized in that the clamping device (18) is formed of a 

stationary abutment jaw (19) and a movable clamping jaw (20), 
the movable clamping jaw (20) being constructed as a spindle-actuated 

carriage. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the clamping device (18) is swivellable 

on the support (3) about an axis oriented perpendicularly to 
the axis of the front deflection roll (4, 4a) and directed 

both perpendicularly to the axis of displacement of the 
longitudinal carriage (14) and perpendicularly to the axis of 

displacement of the cross carriage (16). 
A device according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the clamping device (18) is supported by a disk (35) which 

may be fixed in position by means of blocking means (36, 37). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the rear deflection roll (5) is 

constructed as a drive roll and is swivellable, together with  
 

a motor (10), about a swivel bearing (6) in such a way that 
the distance between the axis of the rear deflection roll (5) 

and the axis of the front deflection roll (4, 4a) may thereby 
be altered. 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized by a hand-operable spindle (8) for the 

swivel movement of the bearer (23) carrying the swivel 
bearing (6) and the motor (10). 
A device according to claim 10, characterized in that 
the spindle (8) is guided in a spindle nut (24) mounted on 

the machine frame (38) and is connected to the bearer (23) 
through the intermediary of a spiral coiled spring (9). 
A device according to claim 11, characterized in that 
connection of the spindle (8) to the bearer (23) is effected 

about an axis perpendicular to the spindle axis but parallel 
with the axis of the swivel bearing (6). 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the front housing cheek (26) is 

constructed as an angle piece (44) which is carried by the 
machine frame (38).
