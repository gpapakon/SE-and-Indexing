<ABSTRACT>
Connection hooks for scaffolding must not only make it possible to connect two scaffolding elements to each other rapidly and securely but should also be durable and cheap to manufacture, as well as connectable to scaffolding elements of very different designs. To this end, the connection hook proposed is designed as an extruded part (1) which acts in conjunction with a component designed to fit very different scaffolding elements to retain the scaffolding element in the hook opening (13), the physically interlocked parts being secured in place by a releasable frictional interlock.

A connecting hook to detachably connect two structural elements, the connecting hook 
fixedly arranged on a first structural element (BE) being able to be placed over a profiled 

member (B) of a second structural element while partially covering this member (B) and 
while being lockable thereto, characterised in that 


(a) the connecting hook is a hollow section piece (1) in cross-section (10), 
(b) two plane surface-parallel fillets (11) are provided on the hollow section piece (1) ) 
and, spaced apart from one another, enclose a plane securing catch (2), 
(c) the securing catch (2) can be brought into a positive connection with the member (B) 
when pivoted or displaced between the fillets (11), locking the cross-section (A) of the 

member (B) in a hook opening (13) formed in the fillets (11), and 
(d) the fillets (11) are connected by at least one flange strip (12) and the latter is profiled 
in such a manner that it forms a contact surface (12a) - perpendicular to the cross-section 

(10) of the hollow section piece (1) and to the surfaces of the fillets (11)- in such a 
manner that this contact surface (12a) is suitable for flange-like securing of the 

connecting hook to the first structural element (BE). 
A connecting hook in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the contact surface 
(12a) is kept substantially plane. 
A connecting hook in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the boundary (12b) 
of the contact surface (12a) is weldable to the first structural element (BE). 
A connecting hook in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
contact surface (12a) appears as a widened flange strip as compared with the remainder 

of the profile when the hollow section piece (1) is viewed in cross-section (10).  
 
A connecting hook in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
positive connection between the securing catch (2) and the member (B) is lockable in a 

friction-locking manner. 
A connecting hook in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
securing catch (2) is pivotable about a spindle (14) fixedly arranged in the fillets (11) 

which is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the member (B). 
A connecting hook in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that a wedge-shaped 
catch edge (21) is formed on the securing catch (2) in such a manner that upon pivoting 

of the securing catch (2), this catch edge (21) locks the cross-section (A) of the member 
(B) in the hook opening (13) and in this position produces a friction connection between 

the catch edge (21) and a base surface (A3) of the member (B) through the effect of the 
wedge. 
A connecting hook in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that a short dog (24') is 
formed on the securing catch (2') in such a manner that, upon pivoting, the securing catch 

(2') locks the cross-section (A) of the member (B) in the hook opening (13) and is 
itself lockable in this position in a friction-locking manner by a wedge (3) which can be 

driven-in between the securing catch (2) and the inner contact surface of the flange strip 
(12). 
A connecting hook in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that a 
striking edge (22, 22') is provided on the securing catch (2, 2'), the securing catch (2, 2') 

being able to be pushed in its closing direction (S) through pressure on this striking edge 
(22, 22'). 
A connecting hook in accordance with Claim 9, characterised in that the striking edge 
(22, 22') projects beyond the fillets (11) of the connecting hook as long as the structural 

elements are still unconnected. 
A connecting hook in accordance with any one of Claims 7 to 10, characterised in that at 
least one additional striking edge (23) is provided on a catch region (20) comprising the 

catch edge (21). 
A connecting hook in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that a 
short supporting edge (15) facing the securing catch (2, 2') is provided at the hook 

opening (13), this supporting edge (15) forming an additional positive connection  
 

between the connecting hook and the member (B) when the latter is covered by the hook 
opening (13). 
A connecting hook in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 12 in conjunction with a 
member (B), characterised in that the form of the hook opening (13) is partially in 

congruency with the form of the cross-section (A) of the member (B). 
A connecting hook in accordance with Claim 12 in conjunction with a member (B), 
characterised in that the hook opening (13) is dimensioned in such a manner that the 

congruent contours (13a, A1) of the hook opening (13) and the member (B) are in 
contact with one another with a slight force fit.
