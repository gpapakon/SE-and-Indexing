Process according to claim 4, characterised in that 
hydroxides, oxalates and/or carbonates are used as 

cobalt compounds which form cobalt oxides. 
Process according to one or more of claims 4 to 6, 
characterised in that CO, H
2
, carbon, natural gas, 
hydrocarbons and/or ammonium formate are used as 

reducing agents.  
 
Process according to one or more of claims 4 to 7, 
characterised in that the reducing agents are diluted 

with inert gases. 
Process according to one or more of claims 4 to 8, 
characterised in that the reaction is carried out 

continuously in rotating tube furnaces or fluidised 
beds. 
Process according to one or more of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the reaction is carried out at 

temperatures of from 580 to 650°C.
