<ABSTRACT>
The press rams and the adjusting ones are all of long stroke (13, 21). Their axes are parallel to those of the press beams, and they extend roughly for the length of the latter. Their cylinders can be fixed to the beams at the bottom, the beams having supports (17) adjustable for height. At the free piston-rod ends thrust plates (24) are mounted, aligned with the supports. The thrust plates are part of the guide head which slide between flat iron bars which are attached to cover plates at the upper and lower ends.

<CLAIMS>
A frame press with a support frame (1), on the 
horizontal cross-members (3, 4) of which vertical bracing 

beams (5, 6, 7) with abutment bearings and pressure 
cylinders, the axes of which run parallel with the 

bracing beams, are arranged so as to be longitudinally 
slidable, these being provided with adjusting devices 

used to adjust the thrust plates of the pressure cylinder 
to the measurements of the frame-sides inserted therein, 

characterised in that the pressure cylinders are long-stroke 
drawing cylinders (13, 21) which, in the extended 

state, are approximately of the same length as the 
bracing beams, the cylinders (13) thereof being secured 

in the lower region of the bracing beams (5, 6, 7), and 
additionally co-operating with the abutment bearing (17) 

which is of an adjustable height, and the piston rods 
(21) thereof have on their free ends respective thrust 

plates (24) directed towards the abutment bearing (17) 
and used both as an adjusting device that can be set to 

match the dimensions of the inserted frame-sides and as 
a means for bracing the latter. 
A frame press as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the thrust plate (24) is part of a 

guide head (22), slidably mounted between flat bars (9), 
which are part of the bracing beams (5, 6, 7). 
A frame press as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the flat bars (9) extend across the 

full length of the bracing beams (5, 6, 7) and are 
connected by means of end plates (10, 11) at the upper  

 
end lower ends. 
A frame press as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised in that the closed end of the long-stroke 

drawing cylinder (13) is secured to the lower end plate 
(11). 
A frame press as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the flat bars (9) are provided with 

transversely extending bores (14) as a height-setting 
means for the manually adjustable abutment bearing (17). 
A frame press as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that at least one bracing beam, by 

preference the beam (7) arranged on the very outside, co-operates 
with long-stroke drawing cylinders (26, 27) 

arranged perpendicular thereto, the cylinders of which 
are secured to one of the lateral uprights (2). 
A frame press as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the thrust plates are shuttle 

plates (28). 
A frame press as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the cylinders (13) of the vertical 

long-stroke drawing cylinder on the one hand and the 
cylinders of the horizontal long-stroke darwing cylinders 

(26, 27) on the other are each connected to a common 
pressure source.
