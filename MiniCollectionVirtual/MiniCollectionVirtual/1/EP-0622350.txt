<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing an aromatic hydroxylic compound represented by the general formula Ar-(OH)n 
(wherein Ar represents an n-valent aromatic hydrocarbon group; and n represents an integer of 1 or 2), 

by the acidic decomposition of a hydroperoxide represented by general formula (I); (wherein Ar and n are 
each as defined above) in the presence of an acid catalyst selected from among tetrafluoroboric, hexafluorosilicic 

and hexafluorophosphoric acids. The process enables an aromatic hydroxyclic compound to be produced 
in a high yield while suppressing the formation of hydroxy-acetone as a by-product. An effective suppression 

of the by-product formation and a higher yield of the target compound can be achieved by conducting the acidic 
decomposition in two stages, i.e. the first stage wherein the reaction is conducted in the first reactor at a 

temperature of 50-95°C and the resulting reaction mixture is sent to the second reactor, and the second stage 

wherein the reaction is conducted at a temperature of 80-120°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing an
aromatic hydroxylic compound useful for the production of
synthetic resins, agricultural chemicals, dyestuffs or
medicines.Among a number of processes for industrial production
of aromatic hydroxylic compounds, there is known a process
in which a hydroperoxide is decomposed in the presence of
an acid catalyst. In this process, sulfuric acid has been
mainly used as the acid catalyst, however, a variety of
acid catalysts have been proposed other than sulfuric acid.For instance, a process wherein trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid is used as the acid catalyst is proposed in
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 50-50311. In
addition, for instance, the use of an ion exchange resin
containing sulfonic acid groups is proposed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,893,995, and the use of a variety of zeolites in
European Patent No. 125,065. The use of Lewis acid such
as stannic chloride, antimony chloride, sulfur tetrafluoride,
silicon tetrafluoride or tungsten hexafluoride is proposed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,267,380, and a further Lewis acid such
as boron trifluoride or boron trifluoride etherate in U.S.
Patent No. 4,267,379.The decomposition of a hydroperoxide in the presence
of an acid catalyst provides a ketone as well as an aromatic
hydroxylic compound. In general, the decomposition of
hydroperoxide having the general formula (I)
 
wherein Ar represents an aromatic hydrocarbon group having
a valence of n; and n represents an integer of 1 or 2,
produces acetone as the ketone. According to the
conventional processes, the thus produced acetone readily
reacts with the hydroperoxide as the starting material to
by-produce hydroxyacetone. Thus, there arises a problem
in the conventional industrial production of aromatic
hydroxylic compound and acetone by the decomposition of
hydroperoxide in the presence of an acid catalyst.The first problem is that the yields of the aromatic
hydroxylic compound and acetone are small. The second
problem is that waste water contaminated with hydroxyacetone
is generated as hydroxyacetone is water-soluble. The third
problem is that the by-produced hydroxyacetone gets mixed
with the resultant aromatic hydroxylic compound to lower
its purity.EP-A-0001043 discloses a process for making and recovering
hydroquinone comprising the acid catalyzed decomposition of
diisopropylbenzene dihydroperoxide in a reaction solvent with
an acid catalyst selected from the group consisting of
H3PO4, HClO4, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, SO2, HBF4, H2SiF6, BF3 and
other Lewis
