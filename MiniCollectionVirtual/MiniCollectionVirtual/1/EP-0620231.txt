<ABSTRACT>
The peptide having an amino acid sequence represented by 
the following formula: 


specifically reacts with an antibody against human 
parvovirus B19. For this reason, the peptide can serve as 

an agent for inspecting the presence of any antibody 
against human parvovirus B19 in a sample and can be used 

in a method for detecting the presence of an antibody 
against human parvovirus B19.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to epitope peptides useful 
for specifically detecting antibodies against human 
parvovirus (HPV) B19, agents for determining the antibodies 
against HPV B19 containing the epitope peptides and a 
method for determining the antibodies against HPV B19. HPV B19 was discovered by Cossart et al. in 1975, in the 
form of unknown particles present in some human blood 
samples and it was proved that HPV B19 was a causal virus 
for man after 1981. The HPV B19 is a causative virus of 
erythema infectiosum and arthritis in man. For this reason, 
accurate and correct detection of HPV B19 is required for 
diagnosis of these diseases. Methods for detecting HPV 
B19 include, for instance, those which comprise direct 
detection of the virus or detection of the antibody against 
the virus. These methods require the use of a substance 
serving as the antigen for the antibody and this is quite 
important for the development of such a diagnostic method. 
Conventionally, there have been used, for instance, HPV 
B19 originated from human erythroblasts and viral antigenic 
proteins prepared through gene engineering techniques, as 
antigenic substances of this kind. It has generally been believed that an antibody recognizes  
 
several amino acid residues on a protein serving as the 
antigen therefor and the corresponding site is called 
"epitope". An antigenic protein has several epitopes and, 
therefore, the virus can easily, specifically be detected 
or determined without using the viral particles per se if 
the diagnostic method makes use of a peptide including 
such a site or epitope. Techniques for solid phase synthesis have recently been 
advanced and accordingly, various peptides have relatively 
easily been prepared. Shade et al. elucidated the genome 
sequence (gene sequence) of HPV B19 which is shown in 
Fig. 1. Fridell et al. synthesized peptides corresponding 
to partial regions of open reading frame (ORF) 1 and ORF 2 
and found that peptides each corresponding to amino acid 
residues extending from 236th to 253th amino acids, 284th 
to 307th amino acids or 732th to 741th amino acids in the 
ORF 1 region or 161th to 170th amino acids in the ORF 2 
region exhibited reactivity with an anti-HPV B19 antibody. 
Moreover, Sato et al. suggested that a peptide corresponding 
to the amino acid sequence extending from 328th to 344th 
amino acids in the viral protein (VP) 2 region reacted 
with HPV B19. In these techniques, however, the HPV B19 originated from 
human erythroblasts is used as
