<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a resist pattern which 
comprises irradiating an active light ray to a resist obtained by 

coating a photosensitive resin composition containing a 
compound capable of generating an acid due to irradiation of the 

active light ray and a silyloxy compound in a binder resin on a 
substrate through a pattern mask to decompose the silyloxy 

compound due to the acid generated at the irradiation region to 
form a silanol compound, and after removing the silanol 

compound, removing the exposed parts of the resist by 
oxygen plasma, the removal of said silanol compound being 

conducted by bringing the film after irradiation of the active 
light ray into contact with volatile organic solvent vapor having 

a boiling of not more than 150°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
forming a fine resist pattern. More particularly, it relates to a 
method for forming a fine resist pattern with submicron order, 
which is applicable to production of electronic circuit elements 
having a fine pattern such as semi-conductor element, magnetic 
bubble memory element, etc. In production of electronic circuit elements having a 
fine pattern such as a semi-conductor element, a magnetic 
bubble memory element, etc., there has been known a method 
which comprises applying a photosensitive film on a surface of a 
substrate to be processed by a spin-coating method, etc. and 
irradiating an active light ray to the photosensitive film through 
a pattern mask to form a resist pattern by utilizing a difference 
in solubility of an exposed part to a developer. However, it has 
been studied to employ a dry development by anisotropic oxygen 
plasma suitable for forming a fine pattern in the developing 
process of a fine pattern. In order to obtain a resist pattern 
having good resolution by the treatment using the dry 
development, it is important to select a photosensitive material 
which shows large difference between dry development 
resistance of a portion remaining after development and 
brittleness of a portion removing during development. For example, there is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open 
Patent Publication No. 2-127645 a method which comprises  
 
substituting an active hydrogen of a novolak resin with a 
functional group containing a silicon atom as a comparatively 
large atom (e.g. -Si-(CH3)3) to obtain a resist pattern having 
good dry development resistance by a selective silylation 
method. Concretely, a fine pattern may be obtained by applying a 
photosensitive resin containing an aromatic ring structure 
having a phenolic hydroxyl group in a molecule on a substrate, 
irradiating active light rays in different wavelength at two 
stages to form a coating having a contrast between dry 
development resistance and brittleness by silylation to the 
photosensitive surface with hexamethyldisilazane vapor, 
followed by dry development. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 63-231330 
also discloses a method which produces a fine pattern 
using a two-layer structure-positive type resist having high 
sensitivity and excellent dry development resistance. In 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 63-231330, a 
photosensitive resist plate is prepared by applying an organic 
resin for the first layer on a substrate, and then applying a 
positiv

<CLAIMS>
A method of forming a resist pattern comprising: 

(i) coating on a substrate a photosensitive resin containing a 
compound capable of generating an acid upon irradiation, an acid 

labile silyloxy group-containing compound and a binder, which silyloxy 
compound decomposes through the acid generated in the exposed 

parts of the resist to form a silanol compound, 
(ii) exposure to light through a pattern mask, 
(iii) removing the silanol compound from the resin and 
(iv) removing the exposed parts of the resist by oxygen plasma, 
 
characterized in that in step (iii), the silanol compound removal is 

conducted by bringing the resist into contact with volatile organic 
solvent vapor having a boiling point of not more than 150°C.  

 
The method according to claim 1, wherein said 
volatile organic solvent is a low molecular weight alcohol, an 

ester, a ketone, an ether, or an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent.
