<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to new substituted 3-phenylpiperidine,
analogs, processes for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical
preparations of such compounds and the use of such compounds in the manufacture of a
pharmaceutical preparation having dopamine receptor activity.In recent years a large body of pharmacological, biochemical and electrophysiological
evidence has provided considerable support in favor of the existence of a specific population of
central autoregulatory dopamine (DA receptors) located in the dopaminergic neuron itself and
belonging to the D2 receptor subclass of DA receptors. These receptors are part of a homeostatic
mechanism that modulates nerve impulse flow and transmitter synthesis and regulates the amount
of DA released from the nerve endings. Recently, Sokoloff, et al., Nature, 347 146-51 (1990)
presented evidence for the existence of a new type of dopamine receptor called D3. In a series of
screened classical and atypical neuroleptics, the preferential dopamine autoreceptor antagonists
(+)-AJ76 and (+)-UH232 possessed the highest preference for the D3 site. The D3 receptor
appears to occur both pre- and postsynaptically, and the regional distribution (high preference in
limbic brain areas) differs from that of the D1 and D2 receptors.Drugs acting as agonists or antagonists on central DA transmission are clinically effective
in treating a variety of central nervous system disorders such as parkinsonism and schizophrenia.
In parkinsonism, for example, the nigro-neostriatal hypofunction can be restored by an increase
in postsynaptic DA receptor stimulation. In schizophrenia, the condition can be normalized by
achieving a decrease in postsynaptic DA receptor stimulation. Classical antipsychotic agents directly
block the postsynaptic DA receptor. The same effect can be achieved by inhibition of intraneuronal
presynaptic events essential for the maintenance of adequate neurotransmission, transport
mechanism and transmitter synthesis.Direct DA receptor agonists, like apomorphine, are able to activate the DA autoreceptors
as well as the postsynaptic DA receptors. The effects of autoreceptor stimulation appear to
predominate when apomorphine is administered at low doses, whereas at higher doses the
attenuation of DA transmission is outweighed by the enhancement of postsynaptic receptor
stimulation. The antipsychotic and antidyskinetic effects in man of low doses of apomorphine are
likely due to the autoreceptor-stimulator properties of this DA receptor agonist. This body of
