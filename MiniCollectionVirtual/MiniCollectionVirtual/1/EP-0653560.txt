<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an intake device for a W-12 reciprocating-piston internal combustion engine with three rows (22, 24, 26) of cylinders, each comprising four cylinders, in which, to obtain a structurally favourable and functionally advantageous arrangement, two intake distributors (28, 30) are provided, each being connected to two cylinders of each row of cylinders by pipes which are separate at least in each row of cylinders.

<CLAIMS>
Intake device for a W-12 reciprocating-type internal
combustion engine having three cylinder banks each

comprising four cylinders, which is supplied with
combustion air via two intake distributors having

separate lines leading to each cylinder bank,
characterised in that each intake distributor (28,

30) is connected to two respective cylinders of any
cylinder bank (22, 24, 26).
Intake device according to claim 1, characterised in
that the intake distributors (28, 30) are disposed

substantially over the outer cylinder banks (22, 26)
in the respective median cylinder plane thereof.
Intake device according to claims 1 and 2,
characterised in that the intake port side of the

cylinder heads of the two outer cylinder banks (22,
26) are situated internally and facing one another

and that two cylinders (1, 4 and 9, 12, respectively)
are connected to the respective intake distributor

(28, 30) situated opposite.
Intake device according to claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the cylinders (2, 3 and 9, 12,

respectively) of the outer cylinder banks (22, 26)
that are situated furthest from the respective intake

distributor (28, 30) are connected to the intake
distributors (28, 30) by substantially rectilinear

lines (40, 42 and 52, 54, respectively) which extend
low over the middle cylinder bank (24).
Intake device according to claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the intake ports of the middle

cylinder bank (24) are situated on the same side and
that the lines (36, 38 and 48, 50, respectively) 

connected to the two intake distributors (28, 30)
incorporate at least two direction changes (62) to

the nearer intake distributor (30) and only one
direction change (62) to the more remote intake

distributor (28).
Intake device according to claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the cylinders of the outer

cylinder banks (22, 26) that are nearest to the
respective intake distributor (28, 30) are linked at

the side to the intake distributors (28, 30) by lines
(32, 34 and 44, 46, respectively) passing around the

front of the cylinder heads, the intake distributors
(28, 30) being provided with air inlets (86, 88)

which discharge at the centre.
Intake device according to claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that given a firing order of 1-8-9-3-6-11-4-5-12-2-7-10,

cylinders 1-4, 6-7, and 9-12
are connected to one intake distributor (28) and the

remainder of the cylinders to the other intake
distributor (30).
Intake device according to claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the intake distributors (28,

30) are combined with single lines to form one
constructional unit which has at least one central

line section (68) situated over the middle cylinder
bank (24) and two outer line sections (70, 72) linked

to the intake distributors (28, 30).
