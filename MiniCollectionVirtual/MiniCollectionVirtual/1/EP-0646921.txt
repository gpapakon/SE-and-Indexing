<ABSTRACT>
An information transfer system for transferring the 
information recorded on a recording medium includes a first 

recording medium for recording the information, a second 
recording medium for recording the information, a 

transmission unit for transmitting the information recorded 
on the first recording medium to the second recording 

medium, and a control unit for causing a writing operation 
on the second recording medium based upon a control signal 

for a readout operation from the first recording medium. 
The information is read out from the first information 

recording medium as an information transfer origin at the 
same time as the information is written on the second 

information recording medium as an information transfer 
destination. This makes it possible to transfer and 

duplicate the information at an elevated speed 
substantially by the readout operation only, so that the 

information transfer and duplication may be expedited.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information transmission
system suitably employed for transmitting the information,
such as the news or music, recorded on a first recording
medium, to a second recording medium at an elevated
velocity.In the information transmission system, employed for
transmitting the information, such as the news or music,
recorded on a first recording medium, to a second recording
medium at an elevated velocity, the information recorded on
the first recording medium, as a transfer origin, is once
read and subsequently recorded on the second recording
medium, as a transfer destination, so that the operation
for reading out the information from the transfer origin
and writing the information at the transfer destination is
necessitated.In a personal computer, typical of the device having
conventional information transfer means, data transfer from
a hard disc to a floppy disc is by reading out data from a
hard disc on the basis of a pre-set size block, temporarily
recording the data in a separate buffer and writing the
data from the buffer memory to the floppy disc. That is,
the data is transferred from the hard disc to the floppy
disc via the buffer memory.If, while the information such as the news or the
music is recorded from the first recording medium to the
second recording medium, using the above-described 
conventional information transfer device, it is desired to
record the information on the third recording medium or
further on one or more other recording medium, it is
necessary to await the end of recording of the desired
information on the second recording medium and subsequently
to record the information on the third recording medium or
further on one or more other recording medium.However, if it becomes necessary to make divisional
recording of the voluminous information, such as the news
or the music, on plural recording media, the time required
in recording all of the desired information is necessarily
increased. Such inconvenience is similarly felt when it
becomes necessary to duplicate the same information in
large quantities on plural recording media.Thus, when it is desired to record the information on
another recording medium, with the use of the conventional
information transfer device, the time necessary in such
information transfer poses a problem, so that it is not
possible for the conventional information transfer device
to cope with the demand for divisionally recording the
voluminous information or duplicating the same information
on plural recording media.It is
