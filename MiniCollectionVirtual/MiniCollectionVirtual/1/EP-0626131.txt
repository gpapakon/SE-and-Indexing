channel. The stable-floor comprises a plurality of openings 

for the discharge of slurry and manure into the dung pit 
and/or discharge channel. The openings comprise a plurality of 

parallel mutually spaced slots extending transversely to the 
longitudinal direction of the dung pit and/or dung channel. 

The stable-floor has a top surface comprising, on at least one 
longitudinal side of the slots, a portion sloping towards the 

slots.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stable-floor for livestock,
said stable floor comprising a floor portion covering a dung
pit and/or a dung channel, said pit and/or channel having
spaced substantially parallel supports extending in a
longitudinal direction supporting a number of floor plates
each bridging the pit and/or channel and together forming
said floor portion, said floor portion comprising a plurality
of openings for the discharge of slurry and manure into the
dung pit and/or dung channel, the openings comprising a
plurality of parallel mutually spaced slots extending
transversely to said longitudinal direction. The invention
also relates to a floor plate for forming such stable-floor.Such a stable-floor is known from published Dutch
patent application 9000628. The known floor, at least the
section thereof located above a dung pit and/or dung channel,
has concrete floor plates comprising a plurality of parallel
slots. The top side of the such grid plates is located in a
horizontal plane and the passage of the manure and slurry
through the slots is promoted by periodically moving a dung
scraper over de stable-floor section formed from such plates.A drawback of the known floor is that the discharge of
slurry and manure is not optimal between the points in time
when the dung scraper is active. The manure and the slurry
are left on top of the plates, so that ammonia is produced,
which may eventually end up in the outside air. Since ammonia
is considered one of the causes of acid rain, it is important
that the ammonia emission be reduced as much as possible.The object of the invention is to provide a floor by
the use of which the ammonia emission of livestock stables
can be reduced. To that end, in accordance with the
invention, a stable-floor of the above described type is 
characterized in that substantially the whole of the top
surface of said floor plates comprises at least one sloping
surface inclined downwards towards at least one of the slots.It is observed that US 3 859 962 discloses a feedlot
floor having a number of sloping sections discharging into
manure removal channels. The floor does not cover a dung pit.
Also the slopes are not in the longitudinal direction of the
channels but perpendicular thereto.Hereinafter the invention will be described in detail
with reference to the accompanying drawings of an exemplary
embodiment.
