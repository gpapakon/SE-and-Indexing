<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates generally to a new apparatus 
and a method for a high-efficiency in-situ vacuum particle 

detection. More particularly, the invention encompasses an 
apparatus for a particle detecting instrument designed to 

detect the presence of gas-borne particles in a vacuum line 
with high efficiency, using a sharply converging nozzle (10) to 

preferentially aerodynamic focus the suspended particles flowing through 
it 

into a small region (26) located on the nozzle axis within a few 
exit dimensions downstream from the nozzle exit. This focal 

region has a dimension much smaller than that of the nozzle 
exit, and is illuminated by a narrow, intense light beam. The 

particles passing through the illuminated focal region are 
detected by photodetector elements (19) receiving light scattered 

from the particles. A method and an apparatus (50) for high-efficiency 
in-situ particle separation and/or measurement is 

also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and a 
method for particle detection, and more particularly, the 
invention encompasses an apparatus and a method for high-efficiency, 
in-situ particle detection and/or particle 
separation. This invention further relates to a particle 
measuring and counting system and, more particularly, to a 
particle measuring and counting system with an improved 
particle sensing means having special applicability for use in 
a vacuum line and semiconductor processing equipment. Instruments for measuring particles and/or separating 
particles are utilized in an increasing number of situations. 
Perhaps the single largest field of use is in the semiconductor 
industry wherein cleanliness in fabricating semi-conductors is 
extremely important. For example, particle counters are 
utilized to monitor the number of particles in the so called 
clean rooms in which semiconductor manufacturing operations are 
conducted. Clean rooms are usually classified on the basis of 
the maximum number of particles of a given size permitted per 
volume of air. To meet specifications and maintain quality 
levels of the product being made, it is necessary to ensure 
that particle contamination is kept to an acceptable minimum 
requirement. The basic system utilized in most airborne particle counters  
 
transmits a sample air stream through a beam of light, which 
results in light energy being scattered by the particles. This 
energy is detected and measured by suitable optics and 
electronics. Significant improvements have been made in the 
optics and electronics employed for detecting and processing 
the scattered light signals. Also, the advent of lasers has 
greatly improved the quality and intensity of the illuminating 
light beam. In spite of these improvements, the accuracy of the data 
output from the instruments still leaves much to be desired. 
Tests also reveal other inaccuracies, such as recirculating 
particles and appreciable discrepancies in absolute count 
correlation between different instruments. Others have addressed this particle detection problem by 
developing particle measuring systems, wherein the particles to 
be detected or measured are entrained in a fluid stream which 
is passed through a light beam, typically a laser light beam. 
As stated earlier, the particles passing through the beam will 
scatter light which is collected and focused on a photodetector 
or photodetectors resulting in electrical pulses being 
generated. The intensity of the scattered
