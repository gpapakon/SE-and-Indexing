<ABSTRACT>
The effects of polarization dependent hole burning and/or polarization 
dependent loss are reduced by modulating the state of polarization (SOP) of an 

arbitrarily polarized optical signal being launched into the transmission path 
periodically through a predetermined sequence of polarization states. The sequence 

of polarization states is selected such that on average the launched modulated signal 
excites substantially all possible polarization states with substantially equal 

probability, independent of the input SOP to the polarization modulator. In one 
exemplary embodiment, the SOP is modulated by a combination cascade of a 

rotating half-wave plate followed by a quarter-wave plate, which rotates at a 
different angular speed. In another exemplary embodiment, the SOP is modulated 

by a combination cascade of two variable phase retarders oriented at fixed angles of 
0° and 45°, where the modulation frequencies of the two retarders are substantially 

different from each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the optical transmission of information and,
more particularly, to improving transmission capabilities over long-distance optical
transmission paths employing repeaters.Very long optical fiber transmission paths, such as those employed in
undersea or trans-continental terrestrial lightwave transmission systems including
optical-amplifier repeaters, are subject to decreased performance caused by a host of
possible impairments. The impairments typically increase as a function of the length
of the optical transmission. In long optical transmission paths that include optical
amplifiers, the impairments tend to vary with time and cause a random fluctuation in
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the optical transmission path. The random
fluctuation in SNR contributes to a phenomenon known as signal fading. The SNR
fluctuations also result in an increased average bit error ratio (BER) in digital signals
being transmitted over the optical transmission path. When the SNR of a digital
signal being transported on such an optical transmission path becomes unacceptably
small relative to the average SNR (resulting in an undesirably high BER), a signal-to-noise
fade is said to have occurred. Experimental evidence has shown that the
signal fading and SNR fluctuations are caused by a number of polarization dependent
effects induced by the optical fiber itself and/or other optical components within the
transmission path. In particular, one of these effects has now been identified as
polarization dependent hole burning (PDHB), which is related to the population
inversion dynamics of the optical amplifiers. A discussion of hole-burning can be
found in an article by D. W. Douglas, R. A. Haas, W.F. Krupke and M.J. Weber,
entitled "Spectral and Polarization Hole Burning in Neodymium Glass Lasers";
IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-19, No. 11, November 1983.PDHB reduces gain of the optical amplifiers within the long optical
transmission path for any signal having a state of polarization ("SOP") parallel to
that of a polarized primary optical signal carried by the transmission path. However,
the gain provided by these amplifiers for optical signals which have an SOP
orthogonal to that of the primary signal remains relatively unaffected. The polarized 
primary signal reduces the level of population inversion anisotropically within the
amplifier. This in turn, produces an isotropic saturation of the amplifier, which
results in a lower gain for optical signals in that SOP. This effectively
