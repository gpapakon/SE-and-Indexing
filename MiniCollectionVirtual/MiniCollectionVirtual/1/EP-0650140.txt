<ABSTRACT>
A method for reducing the volume of ink applied to high-density 
print regions by depleting certain pixels in these regions avoids 

problems associated with excessive ink, improves economy, and yet 
retains print quality. Pixels located along the edges of high-density 

regions are identified and not depleted, thus preserving 
the sharp image demarcations characteristic of high quality 

printing. An upper bound for the percentage of depleted pixels may 
be chosen. A two-dimensional depletion table having certain 

entries designated as potential depletion candidates is tiled 
across a pixel image to be depleted. The designated entries are 

spaced apart within the table. If a pixel in the image is a 
candidate to be depleted according to the depletion table and if it 

is not an edge pixel, then it is depleted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of pixel-array printing.
More specifically, the present invention pertains to a method for
depleting dots in high-density print regions in the ink-jet
implementation of pixel-array printing.The term pixel-array refers to a (usually large) two-dimensional
array of uniformly spaced and sized cells called pixels (picture
elements). By "turning on" certain pixels with ink, light, etc.,
an image of text and pictures may be formed on the array. The
intrinsic binary nature of this image becomes less obvious and the
perceived image quality improves as the number of pixels per unit
area increases.In pixel-array printing, certain areas on the print media may
receive a relatively large amount of ink because of the density of
the printed image in those areas. In ink-jet technology, a form of
pixel-array printing, drops of ink are expelled from one or more
nozzles in a printhead onto a print surface such as paper. Usually
one drop produces a single pixel or dot. Sometimes the amount of
ink is excessive due to expelling larger ink drops than desired
from the printhead. This may be caused by manufacturing
tolerances, high temperatures, or other reasons. When this
happens, these dense areas can cause problems in the quality of
printing and the handling of the media.In areas of high density, the ink may not dry quickly enough. As a
result, the still-wet ink may blot onto the preceding or following
page in the output tray. The following page may rub against the
wet ink and smear the image. When the user picks up the page, the
ink may smear on the user's hands or clothes, also smearing the
image.Also, in areas of high density, ink may be wasted, as the enlarged
drops overlap each other. An equally dense image may be achieved
with less ink, and with less drying problems. Furthermore, too much ink can cause paper print media to buckle, or
"cockle." If the printhead-to-paper spacing is relatively small,
the paper may rub against the printhead and smear the ink.Finally, ink in high-density areas may wick to lower-density areas,
degrading the image quality.Numerous solutions have been tried to solve these problems. Inks
which dry more quickly avoid many of the above-mentioned problems.
Unfortunately, if the ink dries quickly on the page, it may dry too
quickly in the printhead, thereby clogging the nozzles.Inks may be formulated to be absorbed quickly into the paper.
However, these inks also tend to wick along the surface fibers as
well, thus degrading edges in the image.A printhead

A method for depleting pixels in a pixel image having a plurality of pixels
arranged in an image plane, including a first pixel having four adjacent pixels,

the method comprising the steps of:

a) creating a depletion plane having locations corresponding to pixels in
the image plane, some locations corresponding to pixels

designated as candidates for depletion;
b) verifying, by use of the depletion plane, whether the first pixel is a
depletion candidate (12);
c) determining whether the first pixel is an edge pixel (14) by ascertaining

whether the four adjacent pixels are on, and in response to a
positive answer to the ascertaining step, concluding that the first

pixel is not an edge pixel;
d) depleting the first pixel if it is determined to be a depletion candidate
and if it is not an edge pixel (16,18); and
e) repeating steps b), c), and d) for pixels other than the first pixel.
The method of claim 1, wherein in response to a negative answer to the
verifying step, the method proceeds directly to step e) (20).
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the creating step includes
applying a 2 dimensional depletion table (10) having some entries designated

as candidates for pixel depletion.
The method of claim 3, wherein the applying step includes tiling the
depletion table (10) a sufficient number of times to create the depletion place.
The method of claim 3 or claim 4, wherein the applying step includes
determining the value of a given location in the depletion plane by using a

modulo function operating on the coordinates of the location and the
dimensions of the depletion table (10). 
The method of claim 5, wherein the results of the modulo operation are
pre-stored in a lookup table, from which they are retrieved as needed by the

determining step (14).
The method of any of the preceding claims, wherein the image plane and
the depletion plane are each represented by a 2 dimensional, binary-valued

array, and the verifying step (12) includes logical operations on corresponding
entries in these arrays.
The method of claim 1, wherein in response to a negative answer to the
ascertaining step, the determining step further includes checking whether only a

predetermined one of the four adjacent pixels is off and whether that
predetermined one of the four adjacent pixels is surrounded by adjacent pixels

which are on, and, in response to a positive answer to the checking step,
concluding that the first pixel is not an edge pixel.
A method for depleting pixels in a pixel image comprising pixels arranged
as binary values in an input plane, comprising the steps of:


shifting the input plane by one pixel in each of four planar directions,
thereby producing four shifted planes;
generating an non-edge pixel plane as the logical AND of the four shifted
planes;
creating a depletion plane (10) having locations corresponding to
pixels in the image plane, some locations being designated as

candidates for pixel depletion;
producing a pixel-depletion locator plane by generating the logical AND
of the depletion plane and the non-edge pixel plane;
logically inverting the pixel-depletion locator plane; and 
combining, by a logical AND, the inverted pixel-depletion locator plane
with the input plane to produce an image plane with depleted

pixels.
