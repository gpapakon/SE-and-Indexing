<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a lamp (luminaire) with a rotationally symmetrical main reflector (1) of shovel-shaped cross-section, a lamp socket (4), arranged essentially coaxially relative to the main reflector, in order to accommodate one or more lighting means (5) and an auxiliary reflecting device (2) which is adjustable in height relative to or away from the main reflector. The auxiliary reflecting device (2) comprises a secondary reflector (13), facing the main reflector (1), and a downlight reflector (14) pointing away from the lamp socket. The secondary reflector (13) and the downlight reflector (14) are arranged coaxially relative to the main reflector (1) and have a central opening (15). The invention is based on the object of providing a lamp which can produce the impression of natural light which approximates daylight. For this purpose, the axuiliary reflecting device (2) is arranged so that it is adjustable relative to the lighting means (5) in order to set a fraction of diffused and directed light.
