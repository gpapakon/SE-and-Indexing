<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus (1) for cutting hair, having a first cutter (10) and a second cutter (12), which are retained pressed against one another resiliently in a press-on direction (15), and having a drive part (19) for driving the second cutter (12), and having an articulation device (20) between the drive part (19) and the second cutter (12). In the case of said apparatus, the articulation device (20) exhibits two webs (21, 22) which are inclined counter to the press-on direction (15) and are each connected to the drive part (19) and the second cutter (12) via in each case one articulation (23, 24, 25, 26), the two straight connection lines (27, 28) through the two articulations (23, 25 and 24, 26, respectively) of each web (21, 22) intersecting one another essentially in the region of the point (29) of action of the resultants of the friction forces between the two cutters (10, 12).

An apparatus (1) for cutting hairs, having a first cutter (10;6) and second
cutter (12; 43) which is reciprocatingly drivable parallel to a driving direction (14), the

first cutter (10; 6) and the second cutter (12; 43) being urged against one another
parallel to a pressing direction (15), and having a reciprocatingly drivable drive member

(19) for driving the second cutter (12; 43), and having a hinge device (20) between the
drive member (19) and the second cutter (12; 43), via which hinge device a driving

force can be transmitted from the drive member (19) to the second cutter (12; 43),
substantially in the area of the point of application (29) of the resultants of the frictional

forces between the two cutters (10, 12; 6, 43), characterized in that the hinge device
(20) comprises two limbs (21, 22) which are oppositely inclined relative to the pressing

direction (15) and which are each connected to the drive member (19) and the second
cutter (12; 43) by hinges (23, 24, 25, 36), and in that the two connecting lines (27, 28)

through the two hinges (23, 25, 24, 26) of each of the limbs (21, 22) intersect one
another substantially in the area of the point of application (29) of the resultants of the

frictional forces between the two cutters (10, 12; 6, 43).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, in which the second cutter (12; 43)
has a cutter holder (16), characterized in that the cutter holder (16) and the two limbs

(21, 22) as well as the drive member (19) form an integral plastic part and the hinges

(23, 24, 25, 26) are integral hinges (Figs. 2, 3; 4, 5).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that, in addition to
being reciprocatingly movable, the drive member (19) is also mounted to be movable

parallel to the pressing direction (15) and is urged towards the first cutter (10) by means
of at least one spring (17) (Figs. 2, 3).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, characterized in that the spring (17)
acts on the cutter holder (16) at one end and on a stationary bearing element (18) at

another end (Figs. 2, 3).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the drive
member (19) is formed by a drive lever which is pivotable relative to a stationary 

bearing element (30) by means of a pivotal bearing device (31), and in that the pivotal
bearing device (31) comprises a further limb (34) which extends substantially

perpendicularly to the pressing direction (15) and which is pivotally connected to a part
of the stationary bearing element (30) and to the drive lever (19) via each time one

hinge (35, 36) (Fig. 3).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, characterized in that the drive lever
(19) and the further limb (34) as well as the part (33) of the stationary bearing element

(30) form an integral plastic part and the two hinges (35, 36) are integral hinges (Fig.
3).
