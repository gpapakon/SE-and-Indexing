<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a dialkyl carbonate from 
inexpensive raw materials by a safe method using no corrosive 

gas but using alkylene glycol or alkanediol produced as a 
byproduct, the process comprising reacting an alkylene glycol 

or an alkanediol with urea in the presence of a catalyst to 
form an alkylene carbonate derived from the alkylene glycol or 

a six-membered cyclic carbonate derived from the alkanediol and 
reacting the alkylene carbonate or the six-membered cyclic 

carbonate with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst to 
obtain a dialkyl carbonate and an alkylene glycol, or a dialkyl 

carbonate and an alkanediol, wherein the alkylene glycol or the 
alkanediol obtain
ed in the second step is recycled to the first 
step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a dialkyl carbonate. More specifically, it
relates to a process for the production of a dialkyl
carbonate from urea and an alcohol in the presence of an
alkylene glycol or an alkane diol which is recyclable. The
alkyl carbonate is an important compound as a solvent for a
resin and a coating composition, an alkylating agent or a
carbonylating agent. Further, the alkyl carbonate is useful
as an organic solvent, an agent for processing a synthetic
fiber, a raw material for a synthetic resin and a drug, or
an organic synthesis reagent.The dialkyl carbonate is industrially produced
from phosgene as a raw material. However, the high toxicity
of phosgene has been recently recognized as a serious
problem concerning environmental protection. For avoiding
the use of the phosgene, U.S. Patent 5162563, JP-A-56-164145
and JP-A-2-19347 disclose a method in which methanol is
oxidized and carbonylated, and U.S. Patent 4307032 discloses
a method in which alkylene carbonate and an alcohol are
ester-exchanged.U. S. Patent 2,773,881 discloses a process for
producing alkylene carbonate, in which ethylene oxide and
carbon dioxide are allowed to react continuously in the
presence of a pyridine catalyst at 240°C under about 140
atmospheric pressures. The problem with this process is
that the temperature and pressure are high and that ethylene
oxide has a high risk of explosion.European Patent 443,758 discloses a process for 
producing alkylene carbonate from glycol and urea under
atmospheric pressure or elevated pressure in the absence of
a catalyst or in the presence of a tin compound as a
catalyst. In this process, the selectivity to alkylene
carbonate on the basis of glycol which has reacted is as
high as 84 to 99%. However, the conversion of glycol is
66% of the theoretical value or less, and the selectivity
to alkylene carbonate on the basis of urea is as low as 63%
or less. The amount of urea which is decomposed is large.As a process for producing a six-membered carbonate,
DE-310313741 discloses a process for producing a cyclic
carbonate from alkanediol and urea in the presence of an
ester-exchange catalyst. This process cannot be said to be
industrially advantageous, since the yields are as low as
about 80% and the reaction time is as long as 10 to 20
hours.As described above, as a substitute for the method
using phosgene, there has been proposed a process in which
methanol is oxidized and carbonylated, and a process in
which alkylene carbonate and alcohol
