<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerant tube (T1-T6) for use in heat exchangers 
comprises a flat aluminum tube (5) having parallel refrigerant 

passages (4) in its interior and comprising flat upper 
and lower walls (12) and a plurality of reinforcing walls (3) 

connected between the upper and lower walls (1,2), extending 

longitudinally of the tube and spaced apart from one 
another by a predetermined distance. The reinforcing 

walls (3) are each formed with communication holes (6) for 
causing the parallel refrigerant passages (4) to communicate 

with one anther therethrough. The flat aluminum tube (5) 
is prepared from upper and lower two aluminum sheets by 

bending opposite side edges of the lower aluminum sheet 
to a raised form and joining the bent edges to the 

respective side edges of the upper aluminum sheet which 
is flat so as to form a hollow portion. The reinforcing 

walls (3) are formed by joining to the inner surface of the 
upper wall ridges projecting inward from the lower wall. 

The communication holes (6) are formed by cutouts formed 
in the edges of the ridges at a predetermined spacing 

and having their openings closed with the upper wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a method of producing a refrigerant tube for
heat exchangers according to the preamble of claim 1.The term "aluminum" as used herein and in the
claims includes pure aluminum and aluminum alloys.The US-A 5 172 476 discloses a condenser having single piece roll formed
condenser tubes made from aluminum sheet material. The sheet material is
closed to form a tube which is flattened by rolls. Disc-like rolls are provided
to which the flattened tubes are fed, to form channels or webs by the disc-like
rolls on both sides of the flat tube, where the walls of the flat tubes can
be connected by a brazing material or the like.The GB-A 2 256 471 discloses heat exchangers comprising flat tubes similar
to the tubes of the reference discussed before. The flat walls of the flat tube
are provided with cup-like depressions in opposite position connected with
each other.Examined Japanese Patent Publication
No. 45300/91 discloses a condenser for use in car coolers
which comprises a pair of headers arranged at right and
left in parallel and spaced apart from each other,
parallel flat refrigerant tubes each joined at its
opposite ends to the two headers, corrugated fins
arranged in an air flow clearance between adjacent
refrigerant tubes and brazed to the adjacent refrigerant 
tubes, an inlet pipe connected to the upper end of the
left header, an outlet pipe connected to the lower end
of the right header, a left partition provided inside
the left header and positioned above the midportion
thereof, and a right partition provided inside the
right header and positioned below the midportion thereof,
the number of refrigerant tubes between the inlet pipe 
and the left partition, the number of refrigerant tubes
between the left partition and the right partition and
the number of refrigerant tubes between the right
partition and the outlet pipe decreasing from above
downward. A refrigerant flowing into the inlet pipe in
a vapor phase flows zigzag through the condenser before
flowing out from the outlet pipe in a liquid phase.
Condensers of the construction described are called
parallel flow or multiflow condensers, realize higher
efficiencies, lower pressure losses and supercompactness
and are in wide use recently in place of conventional
serpentine condensers.It is required that the flat refrigerant tube
for use in the condenser have pressure resistance since
the refrigerant is introduced thereinto in the form of
a gas of high pressure. To meet this requirement and
to achieve a high heat exchange

a flat aluminum tube (5) having parallel refrigerant passages (4) in its

interior and comprising flat upper and lower walls (1,2) and a plurality of reinforcing

greater than the wall thickness of the refrigerant tube (T1,T2,

T3,T4,T5,T6) to be produced with a pair of upper and lower rolling rolls (8,23,31,9)
one of which has parallel annular grooves (16,28) and thereby reducing the

thickness of the blank to the specified tube wall thickness with the peripheral
surfaces of the rolling rolls (8,23,31,9) to form a flat portion serving as at

least one of the upper wall (1) and the lower wall (2) and form vertical ridges
(3a,3b,21a,21b,29a,39a) projecting from the flat portion integrally therewith

sheet (15) is further passed between a pair of upper and lower rolls (17,18), one

(17) of which has protrusions (19) approximately semicircular in cross section
and arranged at a predetermined spacing at a position corresponding to

each of the parallel annular grooves (16) in the rolling roll (8) to form in
