<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a MR (magnetic resonance) imaging method, in which an object to be examined is moved with a defined velocity relative to an examination region and, in the presence of a stationary homogeneous magnetic field, a multiplicity of sequences act on on the examination region, which sequences in each case comprise at least one radio-frequency pulse and, optionally, a phase-encoding gradient and in each case deliver an MR signal which, after conversion by means of an oscillator signal into another frequency range, is employed for producing an MR image. The object of the invention is to improve the quality of the MR image produced when the object to be examined enters the examination region, without motion artefacts being produced. This is achieved in that, from sequence to sequence,     a) the frequency of the radio-frequency pulses and/or   b) the frequency of the oscillator signal and/or   c) the phase angle of the oscillator signal corresponding to the position of the object to be examined relative to the examination region are adjusted such that the region of the object to be examined imaged in the MR image moves synchronously with the latter.

<CLAIMS>
An MR imaging method in which an object to be examined is moved at a
defined speed relative to an examination zone and a plurality of sequences acts on the

examination zone in the presence of the steady, uniform magnetic field, each of said
sequences comprising at least one RF pulse and at least one magnetic gradient field and

supplying a respective MR signal which, after transposition to another frequency range by
way of an oscillator signal, is used to form MR an image, 
characterized in that
, in order to
form an MR image of a slice which is oriented perpendicularly or obliquely to the direction

of motion, from one sequence to another

a) the frequency of the RF pulses and possibly additionally, in the case of an
obliquely oriented slice,
b) the frequency and/or the phase position of the oscillator signal

is adjusted in conformity with the position of the object to be examined relative to the
examination zone in such a manner that the part of the object which is imaged in the MR

image moves in synchronism with the object.
An MR device for carrying out the method claimed in Claim 1, comprising

a supporting device for supporting an object to be examined
drive means for displacing the supporting device at a defined speed,
a magnet for generating a uniform, steady magnetic field,
means for generating RF pulses of predefined frequency,
a gradient coil system for generating magnetic gradient fields,
means for receiving the MR signals arising in an examination zone, each MR
signal being transposed to another frequency range by means of an oscillator signal,
means for forming MR images from the frequency-transposed MR signals,
a control unit which is arranged to control the drive means, the means for
generating RF pulses, the gradient coil system and the means for receiving the MR signals,

in such a manner that a plurality of sequences acts on the examination zone during the
displacement of the supporting device, each sequence producing a respective MR signal,
characterized in that
, in order to form an MR image of a slice which is oriented
perpendicularly or obliquely to the direction of motion, form one sequence to another


a) the frequency of the RF pulses and possibly additionally, in the case of an
obliquely oriented slice,
b) the frequency and/or the phase position of the oscillator signal

is adjusted in conformity with the position of the object to be examined relative to the
examination zone in such a manner that the part of the object which is imaged in the MR

image moves in synchronism with the object.
