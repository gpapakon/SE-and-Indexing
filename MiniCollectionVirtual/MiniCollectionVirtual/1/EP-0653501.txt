<ABSTRACT>
In a plasma-CVD method and apparatus, plasma is formed from 
a film material gas in a process chamber and, in the plasma, a 

film is deposited on a substrate disposed in the process 
chamber. Formation of the plasma from the material gas is 

performed by application of an rf-power prepared by effecting an 
amplitude modulation on a basic rf-power having a frequency in a 

range from 10MHz to 200MHz. A modulation frequency of the 
amplitude modulation is in a range from 1/1000 to 1/10 of the 

frequency of the basic rf-power. Alternatively, the rf-power is 
prepared by effecting on the basic rf-power a first amplitude 

modulation at a frequency in a range from 1/1000 to 1/10 of the 
frequency of the basic rf-power, and additionally effecting a 

second amplitude modulation on the modulated rf-power. A modulation 
frequency of the second amplitude modulation is in a range from 

1/100 to 100 times the modulation frequency of the first 
amplitude modulation.

(liquid-crystal displays) and others, formation of
ferroelectric films used, for example, in flash memories, gas

producing plasma are arranged parallel to each other in the
longitudinal direction. The apparatus shown in Fig. 16, two
electrodes for producing plasma are arranged parallel to each
other in the lateral direction. These apparatuses have the
substantially same structure and operation except for
arrangement of the electrodes and other several portions. Parts

additionally provided with a heater 210 for heating the
substrate S10 disposed thereon to a deposition temperature. If
radiant heat is used to heat the substrate S10, the heater 210
is spaced from the electrode
