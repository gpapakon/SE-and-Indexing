<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure control device having a housing (10) 
formed with a bore and a solenoid valve (1) mounted in the 

bore. The solenoid valve has a frame (3) of a magnetic 
material mounted in the bore. The frame and thus the 

solenoid valve are mounted in the bore of the housing and 
secured in position by means of a pin (16) received in a hole (15) 

formed in the frame and supported by the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid pressure 
control device in which the solenoid valve is fixed to the 
housing with a simple structure and which is lightweight 
and can be manufactured at low cost. Fig. 5 shows a conventional fluid pressure control 
device including a solenoid valve designated by numeral 1 
in the figure. The solenoid valve 1 has a solenoid coil 2 
and a frame 3 made of a magnetic material to function as a 
magnetic circuit. In the frame 3 is provided a fixed valve 
seat 4. By activating the solenoid coil 2, an armature 5, 
which is biased by a spring 6, is pulled by the magnetic 
force of the coil 2, so that a valve body 7 at the front 
end of the armature 5 moves away from the fixed valve seat 
4. In this state, a fluid chamber 9 defined in front of 
the frame 3 communicates through a passage 8 with a fluid 
passage 11 (which is a discharge passage in this example). A changeover valve 12 is mounted, together with the 
frame 3 of magnetic material, in a bore formed in a housing 
10. This changeover valve comprises a sleeve 12b and a 
spool 12a which has a fluid passage having an orifice and 
moves in the sleeve 12b to a point at which the pressures 
acting on both ends thereof balance, thereby changing over 
the state of fluid communication between an inlet leading  
 
to a pressure source (not shown) and first and second 
outlets leading to the wheel brakes. This type of 
changeover valve is well-known in the art. It is not 
important in the present invention whether or not the 
device includes such a changeover valve. Thus, its 
detailed description is omitted here. The point is that, irrespective of whether the device 
includes the changeover valve 12 or not, the solenoid valve 
1 shows a stronger tendency to come out of the bore in the 
housing as the fluid pressure in the fluid chamber 9 
increases. Thus, the device of Fig. 5 is provided with a seating 
plate 13 bolted to the housing 10 to prevent the solenoid 
valve 1 from coming out of the bore. Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication 4-228985 
discloses other ways to retain the solenoid valve in a 
fixed position. In one embodiment, a frame of a magnetic 
material has a flange which is bayonet-fitted in a groove 
having a larger diameter than an inlet formed by recessing 
the opening of the bore. In another embodiment, both the 
frame and the bore are threaded to keep them in threaded 
engagement with each other. A fluid pressure control device for use in vehicle 
antilock or anti-spin control is required to be as small
