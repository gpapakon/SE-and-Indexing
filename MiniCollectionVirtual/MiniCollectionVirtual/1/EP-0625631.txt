<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a substantially cylindrical rotary spool (valve) intended for the inlet of a fluid into a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine, including at least one elbowed internal duct (1, 1') for the flow of the said fluid, each duct having an inlet orifice (2, 2') situated on the lateral flank of the said spool, an outlet orifice (3, 3') belonging to the cylindrical surface of the said spool, and an elbow (20, 20') intended to hold back the heaviest elements of the fluid under the effect of centrifugal force, the thickness (21, 21') of the wall of the spool between the outer face of the duct and the outside of the spool being relatively slight in the region of the said elbow (20, 20'). According to the invention, at least one of the outlet orifices (3, 3') of at least one of the said ducts and at least one of the said elbows (20, 20') belong to one and the same transverse section of the spool.

Essentially cylindrical rotary valve designed 
for the admission of a fluid into a combustion chamber of 

an internal combustion engine, having at least one bent 
internal flow passage (1, 1') for the fluid, each passage 

having an inlet orifice (2, 2') located on the side wall 
of the said valve, an outlet orifice (3, 3') arranged in 

the cylindrical surface of the said valve, and a bend 
(20, 20) designed to retain the heaviest elements of the 

fluid under the effect of centrifugal force, the 
thickness (21, 21') of the wall of the valve between the 

external face of the passage and the exterior of the 
valve being relatively thin at the level of the bend (20, 

20'), characterised in that at least one of the outlet 
orifices (3, 3') of at least one of the said passages and 

at least one of the said bends (20, 20') are in a same 
transversal section of the valve. 
Rotary valve as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that at least one of the said bends (20, 

20') of at least one of the said passages is located such 
that its upper surface faces the inlet orifice of the 

cylinder head during the combustion phase. 
Rotary valve as claimed in one of claims 1 or 
2, characterised in that the profile of each passage (1, 

1') is such that the fluid initially moves through the 
valve substantially longitudinally before being 

discharged in a substantially radial direction. 
Rotary valve as claimed in any one of the 
previous claims, characterised in that each passage has 

two bends (25, 35) in succession, the first (25) to 
reverse the essentially longitudinal direction of flow, 

the second bend (35) designed to produce a substantially 
radial flow at the outlet. 
Rotary valve as claimed in any one of the  
 

previous claims, characterised in that the rotary valve 
has two passages (1, 1') arranged symmetrically relative 

to an axial plane. 
Rotary valve as claimed in any one of the 
previous claims, characterised in that the zone of the 

passage located close to the inlet (3) of the passage has 
at least one face that is sharply inclined in order to 

direct the mixture efficiently towards the interior of 
the valve.
