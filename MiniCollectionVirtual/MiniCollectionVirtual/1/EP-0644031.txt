<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
the formation by extrusion of a laminate pipe having 
respective layers of metallic and plastics materials, 
especially a triple walled pipe having inner and outer 
layers of plastics material and incorporating between them 
a metallic layer. Such multilayered pipes are in 
themselves well known, as are methods and apparatus for 
their production by extrusion. Typical examples are given 
in EP-A-0024220, EP-A-0237234, US-A-3376181, WO-A-88/03084, 
FR-A-2434326, FR-A-1508630, GB-A-2223427 and US-A-4370186. However, in these prior art constructions, the 
plastics material is adhered to the metallic layer either 
by incorporation of an interlayer of an adhesive between 
each of the layers of plastics material and the metal foil 
(see, for example, GB-A-2223427) and/or pretreating the 
metal foil with a strong acid or alkali (see, for example 
EP-A-0237234) to provide an etched metallic substrate. Such constructions are said to be advantageous during 
the final working up stages during production of the 
multilayered pipe, which is capable of preventing diffusion 
of oxygen radially through it. Typical of the prior art is the extrusion and shaping assembly 
disclosed in US-A-4370186. In this apparatus, a U-section 
form metallic-strip is led around a first extrusion 
apparatus for extruding respective inner layers of adhesive 
and plastics material and formed, by means of a shaping 
device, into a metal tube surrounding a nozzle of the first 
extrusion apparatus, the tube being welded upstream of the 
end of the nozzle running through the tube. Respective 
concentric layers of molten plastics material forming an 
innermost plastics layer and an adhesive layer respectively 
are extruded through an annular section gap between an 
outer wall of the tubular nozzle and a centrally located  
 
die and out of the nozzle through an exit orifice. As the 
sealed tube passes the exit orifice it is coated by the 
adhesive and plastics layers to provide respective inner 
layers. The die has a centrally disposed passage through 
which pressurized air can pass. This serves to force the 
layers of plastics material against the inner surface of 
the tube at a position downstream of the tubular nozzle. 
As shown with particular reference to Fig. 3 of US-A-4370186, 
a second extrusion apparatus downstream of the 
first extrusion apparatus providing the inner layers, 
provides respective concentrically disposed outer layers of 
adhesive and plastics material. A pipe such as
