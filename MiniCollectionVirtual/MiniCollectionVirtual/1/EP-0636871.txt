unbalance, the position of an amount of correction of static 

unbalance on a rim periphery for minimizing a magnitude of 
an amount of correction of residual dynamic unbalance, the 

magnitude of the amount of correction of residual dynamic 
unbalance, and the position of the amount of correction of 

residual dynamic unbalance on the circumference of each of 
the rim end faces are calculated on the basis of the 

magnitude of the amount of correction of unbalance and the 
position of the amount of correction of unbalance on the 

circumference of each of the rim end faces measured. 
Magnitudes and positions of two divided amounts of 

correction of static unbalance on the circumference of the 
opposite rim end faces are calculated, the provision of the 

divided amounts of correction of static unbalance being 
equivalent to a case in which a balance weight whose weight 

is equivalent to the magnitude of the amount of correction 
of static unbalance is fixed at a position on the  

 
circumference of the rim of the amount of correction of 

static unbalance. Balance weights of the weight equivalent 
to the magnitudes of the divided amounts of correction of 

static unbalance are respectively fixed at the positions on 
the circumference of the opposite rim end faces of the 

divided amounts of correction of static unbalance. Also, 
and a balance weight of a magnitude corresponding to the 

magnitude of the amount of correction of residual dynamic 
unbalance is fixed at the calculated position on the 

circumference of each of the rim end faces, thereby 
correcting weight unbalance of the rim-fitted tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of correcting
a weight unbalance of a rim-fitted tire by using a wheel
balancer.It is well-known that vibrations occur if a rim-fitted
tire with unbalanced weight is rotated. Such a weight
unbalance includes a static unbalance in which the weight is
determined without rotating the rim-fitted tire and a
dynamic unbalance which occurs only when the tire is
rotated.As a method of correcting such an unbalance, nowadays,
a method is mainly adopted in which the rim-fitted tire is
mounted on a wheel balancer and rotated to measure the
amount of unbalance requiring correction, and one balance
weight is fixed at one location on each axially opposite end
face of the rim, usually on each of observe and reverse rim
flanges, on the basis of that measurement. In this way, the
static unbalance and the dynamic unbalance are corrected
simultaneously. That is, this correcting method is called a two-plane
balancing method, in which by assuming that there is one
unbalance on each opposite end face of the rim, correction
is effecting by fixing a correcting balance weight whose
weight is equivalent to that of the unbalance is fixed to a
position 180° opposite to the position where the unbalance
is located on each end face.It is well-known that the static unbalance and the
dynamic unbalance, whichever is present, can constitute a
source of vibration for a vehicle, and that the respective
unbalances exert different influences on the vehicle. That
is, the static unbalance causes vertical vibration of a
vehicle, while the dynamic unbalance causes abnormal
vibration of the steering wheel, shimmy, and the like.There are cases where the vertical vibration of the
vehicle, the abnormal vibration of the steering wheel, and
the like are caused by the uniformity of the tire (radial
force variations and lateral force variations), in addition
to the weight unbalance. However, an actual examination of
the vibrations after complete correction of the unbalance
reveals that components which are conceivably ascribable to
a weight unbalance other than that based on uniformity are
included. This tendency is strong when the amount of
unbalance requiring correction, particularly the dynamic
unbalance component, is large. Japanese Patent Application No. 114123/1991 (U.S. Pat.
No. 5,171,067) discloses a method of correcting weight
unbalance of a rim-fitted tire which minimizes vertical and
horizontal vibrations constituting sources of vibration of
the tire in a situation where the tire is actually used. In
