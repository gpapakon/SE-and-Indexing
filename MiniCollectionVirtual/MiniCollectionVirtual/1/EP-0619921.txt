<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronic component with a plurality of layers produced in the combination and with at least one laterally structured layer designed to control a space charge region. In addition, the invention relates to a process for producing such a component. The aim of the invention is such an electronic component having an enhanced switching speed. To this end, the component of the invention has a pn junction as a space charge region with a p and an n conducting layer. One of the two layers is the laterally structured base. Finally, in order to reduce parasitic space charge capacitances in the region of the lateral boundary surfaces, particularly not designed to control the space charge region at the base, the component has an additional layer having the same lateral structure at one of the two lateral boundary surfaces of the base.
