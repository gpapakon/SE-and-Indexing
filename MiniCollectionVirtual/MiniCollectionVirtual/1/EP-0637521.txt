<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a preassembly for
vehicle doors in general, and motor vehicle doors in
particular.In general, a vehicle door comprises an outer
panel with, in most cases, a bottom portion, and a top
frame portion defining a window opening for a sliding
window.In the traditional vehicle door, the bottom portion is normally fitted with a door
lock mechanism, a window regulator for operating and
guiding the sliding window, and the wiring for supplying
the lock mechanism and window regulator, which are
subsequently concealed by an inner cover panel.In recent times, to speed up on-line assembly,
testing and revision of the door, the lock mechanism,
window regulator and supply cables are preassembled
off-line on a movable supporting frame to form a
functional assembly which only later is fitted on-line
to the bottom portion of the outer panel, followed by
fitment of the window to the control slide of the window 
regulator and assembly of the finish cover panel.Though widely adopted, the above assembly process
still remains relatively time-consuming and expensive,
mainly due to the assembly line being supplied
separately, not only with the preassembly, but also with
other components such as the cover panel and window, and
due to the fact that neither the preassembly as
described above nor the other components are normally
fittable to the outer panel fully automatically, e.g. by
means of robots. EP 0 336 565 discloses a vehicle door comprising
an inner and outer door panel, each of which is hinged
to a vehicle body, and a door hardware which comprises
a window regulator mechanism, a door latch and a door
latch release handle each of which are directly
connected to an outer surface of the inner door panel. It is an object of the present invention to
provide a straightforward vehicle door preassembly
designed to overcome the above drawbacks and which, in
particular, is fittable automatically to the outer
panel.According to the present invention, there is provided a vehicle
door preassembly as defined in claim 1. The present invention also relates to a vehicle
door manufacturing process.According to the present invention, there is
provided a process for manufacturing a vehicle door
as defined in claim 10.A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention 
will be described by way of example with reference to
the accompanying drawings, in which:
