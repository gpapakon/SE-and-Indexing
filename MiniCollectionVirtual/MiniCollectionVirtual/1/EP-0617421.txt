<ABSTRACT>
In a scanner for a magnetic tape apparatus having an upper drum (11) and lower drum (12), separated by a head gap (13), having a head wheel (14) mounted rotatably in the head gap (13) and having a magnetic tape (16) guided obliquely over the head gap (13), the disturbing effect of air films underneath the tape is prevented by the tape running surface having on both sides of the head gap (13) depressions (22, 23) which are adapted to the thickness of the air films (24, 25) formed underneath the tape (16) upon rotation of the head wheel (14).

<CLAIMS>
A scanner (10) for a magnetic-tape apparatus, comprising an upper and a
lower drum (11, 12) separated by a drum gap (13), and a head disc (14) carrying

magnetic heads (15) and supported to be rotatable in the drum gap (13), a magnetic tape
(16) being guided obliquely across the drum gap (13) by means of a ruler (17) on the

5 lower drum (12), 
characterized in that
the tape contact surfaces at both sides of the drum gap (13) have recesses (22,
23) adapted to the thickness of the air films (24, 25) formed underneath the tape

(16) during rotation of the head disc (14),
the smaller tape contact surfaces (26', 27') obtained as a result of the recesses
(22, 23) are formed in uniform radial raised portions (26, 27) having a constant

radius at the drum edges at both sides of the drum gap (13), and the radial
height (H) of said raised portions relative to the recesses (22, 23) is adapted to

the thickness of the air film (24, 25) formed, and
the radial raised portions (26, 27) have lips (28, 29) pointing towards the drum
15 gap (13).
A scanner as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the triangular drum
areas (18, 19) over which the tape (16) moves and situated at both sides of the drum

gap (13) are provided with triangular trough-shaped recesses adapted to the thickness of
the air films formed, the edges of said recesses at the location of the drum gap (13) and

20 of the tape edges serving as supporting surfaces for the tape (16).
A scanner as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the height (H)
of the radial raised portions (26, 27), or the height of the edges of the trough-shaped

recesses (22, 23) relative to the bottoms of the recesses, is approximately 10 to 20 Âµm.
