<ABSTRACT>
The clamping system makes it possible to hold a free part (1B) of a workpiece (1) during operations performed on it. The device comprises shoes (14A, 14B) each integral either with a pin (15) or with a tube (17) equipped with a small operating lever (18). The assembly is mounted in a clamping base (11) between two shoulders (13). Clamping each shoe in the clamping position by means of a screw (19) and of two end flanges (20A) and (20B) allows the assembly to be blocked. Application to the clamping of turbojet blades during the operation of electrochemical machining thereof.

A device for clamping a free flat part (1B) of a 
workpiece (1) in order to completely immobilise the 

workpiece while it is being treated, the device 
comprising a base (11),
 
characterised in that it comprises: 


means for multipoint clamping of the free part 
(1B) at a number of places distributed on either 

side of the two surfaces of the free part (1B); 
these clamping means comprise on either side of 

the free part (1B) of the workpiece (1) a first 
clamping shoe (12A) eccentrically mounted on a 

first end of a spindle (15) pivotably mounted in a 
clamping shoulder (13) of the base (11), a first 

lever (18) being so disposed at the second end of 
the spindle (15) that a pressure on the lever (18) 

leads to the shoe (12A) applying a pressure to one 
surface of the free part (1B) of the workpiece (1) 

so as to retain the free part (1B) on the clamping 
shoulder (13), and  

 
a single means for locking the clamping means in 
the clamping position. 
A clamping device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the locking means comprise: 


a clamping shoulder (13) of the base (11) in which 
a spindle (15) is rotatably mounted; 
a clamping screw (19) extending through the base 
(11) and parallel to the spindles (15); and 
a first cheek (20A) into which the screw (19) is 
screwed and which is clampable against a clamping 

surface (14A) of the first shoe (12A). 
A clamping device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that it comprises a second clamping 

shoe (12B) eccentrically mounted on a first end of a 
pivoting tube (17) pivotable around a spindle (15) of 

the first shoe (12A), a second lever (18) being so 
disposed at its second end that a pressure on the 

levers (18) leads to each shoe (12A, 12B) pressing on a 
surface of the free part (1B) of the workpiece (1) in 

order to provide four-point retention of the free part 
(1B) of the workpiece (1) between the shoes (12A, 12B). 
A clamping device according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the locking means comprise:  

 

the clamping shoulder (13) of the base (11) and in 
which a spindle (15) is rotatably mounted and 

surrounded by a pivoting tube (17); 
a clamping screw (19) which extends through the 
base (11) parallel to the spindles (15) and 

pivoting tubes (17); 
a first cheek (20A) in which the screw (19) is 
screwed and which is clampable against a clamping 

asurface (14A) of the first shoe (12A), and 
a second cheek (20B) movable in translation on a 
second end of the clamping screw (19) near the 

head thereof in order to be so clamped against a 
surface (14B) of the second shoe (12B) as to clamp 

the shoes (12A) and (12B) by means of the screw 
(19) against the clamping shoulder (13) to provide 

a four-point clamping. 
A clamping device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that to provide a clamping at 2-N 

points the clamping means comprise on either side a 
predetermined number (N-2) of supplementary shoes (25) 

each eccentrically mounted on a supplementary pivoting 
tube (26) concentric with a spindle (15) and a first 

pivoting tube (17), and 

the locking means comprise on either side the same 
predetermined number (N-2) of clamping cross-members 

(24) so as to clamp each shoe (12A, 12B) and (25) 
against a crosspiece (24) or the clamping shoulder 

(13). 
Use of a device according to any of the previous 
claims to retain a turbomachine blade (1) already 

retained by way of its root (1A) during final 
electrochemical machining of both sides of the blade 

(1).
