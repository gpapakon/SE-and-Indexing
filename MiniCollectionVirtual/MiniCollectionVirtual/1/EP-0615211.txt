<ABSTRACT>
In a method for storing security data in a franking machine, identical data (A, B, C, D) are stored in at least four storage areas (a, b, c, d). The data (A, B, C, D) of each storage area (a, b, c, d) are compared with the data (A, B, C, D) of further storage areas (a, b, c, d). Depending on this comparison (V1 to V6), the storage area or areas (a, b, c, d) having faulty data (A, B, C, D) are found and, if necessary, are loaded again with data (A, B, C, D) from a storage area (a, b, c, d) with faultless data. The method operates with little complexity and can correct data errors found.

Method for storing data that is relevant to
security in a franking machine, by which method

identical data (A, B, C, D) is stored in a plurality of
storage areas (a, b, c, d), the data (A, B, C, D) is

read back out from the storage areas (a, b, c, d) and
data (for example A) of the one storage area (a) is

compared with data (for example B, C, D) of another
storage area (for example b, c, d), and by which method

storage areas having erroneous data are detected,
characterised in that identical data (A, B, C, D) is

stored in at least four storage areas (a, b, c, d), in
that the data (A, B, C, D) of each storage area (a, b,

c, d) is compared with the data (A, B, C, D) of further
storage areas (a, b, c, d), and in that as a function

of this comparison (V1 to V6) the storage area or
storage areas (a, b, c, d) that has/have erroneous data

(A, B, C, D) is/are detected and, if applicable,
reloaded with data (A, B, C, D) from a storage area (a,

b, c, d) having non-erroneous data.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the data (B, D) is stored in an inverted manner in

at least two storage areas (b, d), and in that for the
purposes of comparison with non-inverted data (A, C)

the inverted data (B, D) is negated.
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the comparison (V1 to V6) of the

data (A, B, C, D) is effected by means of an exclusive-OR
operation.
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the comparison (V1 to V6)

is carried out byte by byte in a bit-oriented manner. 
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that an error number (Z) is

determined that indicates how often there is a lack of
correspondence of the data (A, B, C, D) of the storage

areas (a, b, c, d), and in that these errors are
eliminated as a function of the error number (Z).
Method according to claim 5, characterised in
that before or when storing the data (A, B, C, D) in

the storage areas (a, b, c, d) a first check sum (PSA
to PSD) is formed from the data (A, B, C, D) of each

storage area (a, b, c, d) and is stored, and in that,
when reading out the data (A, B, C, D) or afterwards, a

respective second check sum (PSA' to PSD') is
determined from the data (A, B, C, D) of the storage

areas (a, b, c, d) and is compared with the first check
sum (PSA to PSD), and in that errors are eliminated as

a function of the comparison of the check sums (PSA to
PSD; PSA' to PSD').
Method according to one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that in the case of four

storage areas (a, b, c, d) four comparisons (V1, V2,
V5, V6) of the data (A, B, C, D) and, if applicable, of

the check sums (PSA to PSD; PSA' to PSD') are carried
out.
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that in the case of four storage areas

(a, b, c, d) six comparisons (V1 to V6) of the data (A,
B, C, D) and, if applicable, of the check sums (PSA to

PSD; PSA' to PSD') are carried out.
Method according to claim 8, characterised in
that in the case of an error number (Z) of 3 that 

storage area (A) which has shown data errors in three
comparisons (V1, V2, V3) is determined, in that the

first check sum (PSA) and the second check sum (PSA')
of this storage area (a) are compared with each other,

and in that this storage area (a) is loaded with data
(B) or inverted data from one of the other storage

areas (b) if no correspondence has been established in
the check sum comparison (46).
Method according to claim 8, characterised in

storage area (a) which has shown data errors in three
comparisons (V1, V2, V3) is determined, in that the

first check sum (PSA) and the second check sum (PSA')
of this storage area (a) are compared with each other,

and in that the data (A) of this storage area (a) is
stored in the other storage areas (b, c, d) if

correspondence has been established in the check sum
comparison (46).
Method according to claim 8, characterised in
that in the case of the error number (Z) of 4 those
