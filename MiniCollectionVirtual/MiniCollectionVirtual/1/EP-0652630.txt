<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor stack and
more particularly relates to a semiconductor stack composed
of a positive switching device and a negative switching
device in which two terminals of the positive side and the
negative side thereof are led to the same surface.Currently, the high-frequency pulse width modulation
(PWM) control method which uses high-speed switching devices
is being widely used in power converters. As the capacity
of the power converter is made larger, large capacity high-speed
switching devices are being used in parallel. Also,
in the high-frequency PWM control method, in order to
suppress surge voltage generated during switching by
reducing the reactance between high-speed switching devices,
the high-speed switching devices are installed close to each
other and their distance from the capacitor is shorter. A prior art semiconductor stack is described below with
reference to Figures 10 and 11.Figure 10 shows a circuit construction of a
semiconductor stack 7 composed of the two arms of the
positive side and negative side of a given AC phase in a
three-phase or single phase bridge circuit. In this
circuit, 6 parallel semiconductor switching devices 1a, 1b,
1c, 1d, 1e, 1f and 6 parallel semiconductor switching
devices 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f, each composed of a
transistor, are connected in series between DC terminals 9
and 10. Also in this circuit, two capacitors 15 are
connected between DC terminals 9 and 10. Devices la - lc
are connected in parallel between a DC conductor 3H and an
AC conductor 5H. Devices 1d - If are connected in parallel
between a DC conductor 3R and an AC conductor 5R. Devices
2a - 2c are connected in parallel between AC conductor 5H,
and a DC conductor 4H. Devices 2d - 2f are connected in
parallel between AC conductor 5R and a DC conductor 4R. An
AC terminal 11 is led from AC conductors 5H, 5R. The
connection between capacitors 15 and DC terminals 9 and 10
is carried out by DC conductors 3a and 4a, respectively.Figure 11 shows the packaging of prior art
semiconductor stack 7 shown in Figure 10. In Figure 11, (a)
is a plan and (b) is a right side elevation.In Figure 11, devices la - If and 2a - 2f are arranged,
six to each face, on the two faces of a heat receiving unit 
6a of a heat sink 6 with a built-in heat pipe. Devices 1a
and 2a, devices 1b and 2b, and devices 1c and 2c are
arranged in sequence on the front surface of heat receiving
unit 6a of heat sink 6 from a heat radiation unit 6b side.
Positive terminals C of devices 1a, 1b and 1c are each
conn
