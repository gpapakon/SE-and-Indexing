<ABSTRACT>
A process for regenerating spent bleaching 
clays and acid-activated smectite catalyst granules 

includes: (1) an extraction step to remove a majority 
of entrained hydrocarbons, such as oil, preferably 

about 75% to about 95% by weight of the entrained oil, 
when regenerating bleaching clays; (2) an oxidation 

step to remove the majority of remaining carbonaceous 
adsorbates which are not removed by the preceding 

extraction step, and to carbonize a majority of the 
remaining adsorbates, thereby increasing the adsorption 

capacity of the clay; and, optionally, (3) an acid wash 
step to restore the acidity normally associated with 

fresh acid-activated bleaching clays. In a second 
embodiment, the clay is oxidized with O₂ at a 

temperature below about 360°C to carbonize a portion of 
the hydrocarbons remaining after extraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method 
of regenerating spent acid-activated smectite clays. 
In another embodiment, the present invention is 
directed to a relatively low temperature method of 
regenerating spent acid-activated smectite clays while, 
simultaneously, carbonizing a portion of the organic 
matter contained by the clay to improve the ability of 
the regenerated and carbonized clay to adsorb organic 
liquids. Acid-activated bentonite clays in the form of 
finely ground powders, commonly called bleaching clays 
or bleaching earths, are used to adsorb colored 
pigments, such as carotenoids and chlorophyll, as well 
as colorless contaminants, such as phospholipids, and 
hydroperoxides from edible and inedible oils. This 
process is called "bleaching" and serves both cosmetic 
and chemical purposes: (i) it reduces color - very 
clear, almost water white oils are produced that meet 
with U.S. consumer expectations, and (ii) it stabilizes 
the oil - both the colored pigments and colorless 
contaminants tend to destabilize the oil (i.e., cause 
the oil to become rancid more easily) if they are not 
removed.  Usually, the bleaching process includes 
adding a bleaching clay powder to a contaminated oil at 
levels in the range of about 0.35 to about 3 wt%, 
depending on the type and quality of oil being 
processed. The clay/oil mixture then is heated to a 
temperature in the range of about 90°C to about 120°C 
for about 20 to 30 minutes, after which time the now 
"spent" clay is separated from the bleached oil by 
filtration, using filter presses or pressure leaf 
filters. Typically, the filter cake resulting from the 
filtration operation contains the pigments and other 
contaminants removed from the oil, as well as 
considerable quantities, for example, about 25 to about 
40 wt%, of entrained oil that is difficult to remove 
from the spent clay. It is known that when extra processing, such 
as solvent or lye-extraction, is employed to remove the 
entrained oil from the spent clay, the extracted oil is 
of poor quality. In addition, the extra processing 
involved is both difficult and expensive. Accordingly, 
most oil refiners choose to dispose of spent bleaching 
clay from their operations by having it hauled away to 
landfill sites. Unfortunately, spent bleaching clays also 
process rather high surface areas, for example, about 
250 to about 350 m²/gm, and when the spent clays are 
saturated with entrained oils, they can spontaneously 
ignite. Because of this pyrophoric tendency, oil-laden
