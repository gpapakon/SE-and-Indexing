<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The problem of the invention is to achieve clamping of the workpiece against the ram and hence holding of the sheet, even during the drawing operation of a single-acting press or of a single-acting drawing stage of a transfer press, without the ram having to operate against this force and without having to manage without the connection between the press ram and the plunger plate, in order to reduce the width between uprights of the press and, at the same time, to avoid affecting the position of the ram guide and the free area between the lateral uprights and the sliding table or between the lateral uprights and the carrying rail. 2.2. In the case of the pressure pad, working cylinders (14) with piston rods at both ends are arranged in the press table, these piston rods being supported against one another during the drawing process, one end of the piston rods being connected by transmission elements to the pressure-pad frame, on which, underneath, a cushion unit for the production of the upward movement of the drawing cushion and of the ejection force is at the same time arranged, characterised in that the other piston rod (12) of the working cylinders (14) is connected to a mechanism for converting rotary motion into translational motion, the mechanism is connected operatively on the input side to the drive shaft (27) of the press drive (1), and the working piston (15) of each working cylinder (14) can be subjected to pressure on the mechanism side. A further solution is configured without the cushion unit and with, in each working cylinder (14), working pistons (15) that can be subjected to pressure on both sides.

Blank-holder in combination with a single-acting 
press, in particular a mechanical press and transfer 

press, in which working cylinders (14) with piston 
rods (12) on both sides are disposed in the press 

table (18) and are supported against one another 
during the drawing process, while one side of the 

piston rods (12) is connected, via transmission 
members (8, 9, 17), to the blank-holder frame (6) on 

which there is simultaneously disposed, underneath, a 
cushion unit (23) for generating the upward movement 

of the drawing cushion and the ejecting force,
 
characterised in that 


the other piston rod (12), in each case, of the 
working cylinder (14) is connected to a gear unit for 

converting rotatory movement into translatory 
movement, 
the gear unit is in operative connection, on the input 
side, with the drive shaft (27) of the press drive 

(1), and the working piston (15) of each working 
cylinder (14) can be acted upon by pressure on the 

gear unit side.

(1), and the working piston (15) of each working 

cylinder (14) can be acted upon by pressure on two 
sides. 
Blank-holder in combination with a single-acting press 
in accordance with claims 1 and 2,
 
characterised in that 


the operative connection between the drive shaft (27) 
of the press drive (1) and the gear unit can be 

produced by a coupling gear unit (22), such as a 
bevel-wheel or toothed belt gear unit. 
Blank-holder in combination with a single-acting press 
in accordance with claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that 


the gear unit is so designed that there is disposed on 
the drive shaft (30) a crank (31), the other end of 

which is in operative connection, via a coupling rod 
(32), with a rocking lever (34) mounted at the point 

of rotation (33), and the free end of the rocking 
lever (34) is connected, via a strap (35), to one 

lever arm (36a) of an angle lever (36) mounted at a 
point of rotation (29), while the other lever arm 

(36b) is connected, via a strap (37) to the free end 
of a second rocking lever (38) rotatably mounted on 

the drive shaft (30), and there is disposed, in the 
central region of the second rocking lever (38), a 

connecting rod (39) which is articulated onto the 
pressure point (28) with its other end.
