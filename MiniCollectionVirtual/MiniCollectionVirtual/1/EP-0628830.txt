<ABSTRACT>
Conventionally Ge photodiodes have been employed 
as photodetectors for the reliability test of the 

semiconductor lasers of a 1.0 µm and 1.6 µm 
wavelength, since Ge photodiodes have wide receiving 

regions with high sensitivity for the range of 
wavelength. A large dark current flows in a Ge 

photodiode at a high temperature. Thus, Ge 
photodiodes must be cooled. Also the sample lasers 

are heated to accelerate the test. The lasers and the 
Ge photodiodes require two independent thermostats, 

and fiber rods are used to connect the Ge photodiodes 
to the lasers. The present invention uses InGaAs 

photodiodes (21) as photodetectors. The InGaAs 
photodiodes (21) and sample lasers (11) can be placed 

face to face in the same thermostat (1). Several 
pairs of a laser and a InGaAs photodiode can be 

aligned in the axial direction in the thermostat. A 
saving in the packing space per sample increases the 

number of lasers which can be examined in a test 
cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Utility 
Model Application No.36903/1993 filed June 11, 1993, which is 
incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to a testing device of 
reliability of a semiconductor lasers which are used as light 
sources of optoelectronic communications. The semiconductor 
lasers for the optoelectronic communications emit light beams of a 
wavelength of 1.0 µm to 1.6 µm. The lasers are fabricated from the 
semiconductor of InP. Reliability test is a procedure for examining 
long-term variations of emission property. Thus the reliability 
test reveals the time-dependent degradation of lasers. The 
reliability test comprises the steps of disposing semiconductor 
lasers in the vessel at a high temperature, applying driving 
currents to the lasers, measuring the light power emitted from the 
lasers by photodetectors and recording the time dependent change 
of the emission efficiency of the lasers.  The reliability test of semiconductor lasers requires a 
photodetector for monitoring the light power. The photodetector 
must receive most of light beams emitted from the laser, since the 
total light power is important for estimating the reliability. In 
general, laser diodes have wide aperture angles. Conventional 
reliability tests have employed germanium (Ge) photodiodes for 
detecting light emission of lasers. A Ge photodiode has a wide 
light receiving area. The wide receiving area allows the Ge diode 
to gather almost all light beams emitted from a laser and measure 
nearly total power of the beams. However germanium diodes are 
afflicted with the drawbacks of a large dark current and its big 
variation caused by temperature change. Fig.1 shows a plan view of a conventional tester of 
reliability of a laser. The test device comprises two thermostats (1) 
and (2). A thermostat is a closed vessel whose temperature can be 
adjusted at an arbitrary, preset temperature. First thermostat (1) 
is provided with a plurality of laser diodes (11) to be tested. 
Second thermostat (2) maintains the same number of germanium (Ge) 
photodiodes (21). The emission outputs of the semiconductor lasers 
(11) are optically connected to the receiving input of the Ge 
photodiodes (21) by fiber rods (3). The temperatures of the two  
 
thermostats (1) and (2) are adjusted independently by a temperature 
controlling unit (4). The conventional reliability tester demands 
two independent thermostats, because the Ge photodiodes require a 
temperature of environment different from
