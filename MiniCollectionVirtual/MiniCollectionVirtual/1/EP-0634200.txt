<ABSTRACT>
A filter assembly in housing 11 into which a 
thixotropic fluid is injected for filtration comprises filter 

layer 14c that is positioned along the central axis and which 
has the finest mesh, said filter layer 14c being surrounded 

successively in order by middle filter layer 14b having the 
next finest mesh and outer filter layer 14a of a coarse mesh. 

The thixotropic fluid injected into the housing passes through 
layers 14a, 14b and 14c in that order, whereby the fluid flows 

out of the housing through one stage of filtration steps.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of filtering
thixotropic fluids such as magnetic paints and thick printing
inks for rejecting foreign matter and agglomerates therefrom.From DE-A-1950068 a filter device containing a cylindrical element having
increasing coarseness from the inside to the outside thereof is known.Magnetic paints as an example of thixotropic fluids can
be manufactured by charging ferromagnetic particles into a ball
mill and mixing them with a polymeric binder to form a
dispersion, which is then coated on a support to produce a
magnetic recording medium.However, the magnetic paints thus manufactured contain
various unwanted substances such as the particles that
originate from the ball mill and other objects as a result of
friction during the mixing procedure, undispersed foreign
matters such as ferromagnetic particles and swollen fat
globules, as well as the product of reagglomeration. It is
therefore necessary to reject these unwanted substances from
the magnetic paints by passing them through filters before they
are coated onto the support.See, for example, an Examined Japanese Patent
Publication (Kokoku) Hei 2-62895, which teaches an apparatus
having the general layout shown in Fig. 5. Paint tank 1
contains a magnetic paint 2 prepared by mixing magnetic 
particles with a polymeric binder and a solvent such as
toluene, xylene or cellosolve in a ball mill so as to form a
dispersion. The paint 1 in the tank 2 is agitated with a
propeller 3. The agitated paint 2 as aspirated by a pump 4
flows through a supply channel B and is passed through a filter
5 to be sent to a storage tank 6. The paint in the tank 6 is
forced by a pump 7 to flow through a supply channel D and
extruded through a coating head 8 to be coated on a support 9.The filter 5 shown in Fig. 5 is usually composed of a
single kind of filter medium, typically of a coarse mesh.
Hence, it is capable of highly efficient trapping and, hence,
rejection of the foreign matter in the magnet paint if it is
comprised of large particles. On the other hand, fine
particles will pass through the screen untrapped or they will
often clog the gaps between the large particles trapped in
screen openings, whereby the life of the filter is shortened to
end prematurely. A prior art approach to the solution of this
problem is shown in Fig. 6; a plurality of filters are arranged
in such a way that their mesh size decreases toward the
downstream end so as to prevent their clogging; in the case
shown in Fig. 6, filter 5a (mesh size: 16 µm) is

<CLAIMS>
A method of filtering a thixotropic fluid wherein the thixotropic
fluid to be filtered within one filtration region is passed

successively in order through a filter element of a coarse mesh
(14a) and filter elements (14b, 14c) of increasing fineness in

mesh so that the rejection of contaminating foreign matter and
agglomerates from the thixotropic fluid is completed through a

single stage of filtration steps.
The method according to claim 1, wherein the thixotropic fluid
to be filtered is a magnetic paint comprising a ferromagnetic

powder, a polymer binder and an organic solvent for dissolving
said polymer binder,

and wherein filter elements (14a, 14b, 14c) are used having a
different mesh in order of increasing fineness in mesh size in a

range of 3µm to 20µm.
The method according to claim 2, wherein filter elements are
used in the form of concentric cylinders having the filter

element of the finest mesh size provided along the central axis
at the innermost position, and arranging the filter elements of

decreasing fineness in mesh size stacked successively in order
and radially outward.
The method according to claim 2, wherein two to five filter
elements are employed.
The method according to claim 4, wherein three filter elements
are employed.
