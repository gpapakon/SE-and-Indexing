<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switchable cholesteric filter. Said filter 
comprises an optically active layer which is situated between two substrates which are 

both provided with an electrode for applying an electric field. The optically active layer 
comprises a liquid-crystalline material which is in the cholesteric phase. In accordance 

with the invention, the optically active layer comprises a three-dimensional polymer 
network which consists of the polymerization product of maximally 2 wt. % of 

monomers with at least two polymerizable groups and maximally 30 wt. % of liquid-crystalline 
monomers with one polymerizable group, and the rest of the optically active 

layer consists predominantly of a mixture of chiral and achiral liquid-crystalline 
molecules. An optically active layer of this composition can be switched in a simple and 

reproducible manner by means of an electric field. The invention also relates to a 
luminaire comprising such a switchable cholesteric filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a switchable cholesteric filter comprising an
optically active layer which is situated between two substrates which are both provided
with an electrode for applying an electric field, said optically active layer containing a
liquid crystalline material which is in the cholesteric phase. The invention also relates to
a luminaire having such a switchable cholesteric filter. Switchable cholesteric filters can
also be used in circular polarizers and reflectors as well as in so-called "notch filters"
and "bandpass filters".A switchable cholesteric filter of the type mentioned in the opening
paragraph is known per se. For example, in Japanese Patent Application JP 63-128317
a description is given of a cholesteric filter whose colour can be switched over a wide
wavelength range by means of an electric field. The optically active layer of the known
cholesteric filter consists of a thermotropic copolymer having substituted glutamate
residues as the side groups. At a temperature below the liquid crystalline transition
temperature, the polymer material is in the cholesteric phase. It is noted that "the
switching of a cholesteric filter" is to be understood to mean herein that the reflection
characteristic of the filter, for example the wavelength or the intensity of the reflection
band, is changed under the influence of an electric field.The known cholesteric filter has disadvantages. For example, the changing
of the colour is a complicated and time-consuming activity. To change the colour, the
temperature of the optically active layer is raised above the liquid crystalline transition
temperature, whereafter an electric field is applied in the isotropic phase or the intensity
of the field present is changed, after which the layer is cooled to the desired
temperature. Besides, in the case of the known filter, the switching rate and the
reproducibility of the switching process are insufficient. For example, at a certain field
intensity, the reflection band changes with time. It has been found that a considerable
degree of hysteresis occurs during switching. In addition, the temperature sensitivity of
the filter is relatively high. It is an object of the invention to overcome the above-mentioned
disadvantages. The invention more particularly aims at providing a cholesteric filter
having a high switching rate and exhibiting a stable switching behaviour without
hysteresis when used over a prolonged period of time. In addition, the reflection
characteristic of the filter should exhibit a
