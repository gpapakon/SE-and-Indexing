<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an external skin treatment composition and, more specifically, it relates to an external skin treatment composition having a synergistically improved skin roughening improvement effect by incorporating thereinto vitamin A and a polyoxyalkylene modified organopolysiloxane or an anti-inflammatory agent, with taking safety into consideration.Various pharmaceutically effective components are formulated into external skin treatment compositions. Among these pharmaceutical effects, an effect, by which the changes in the skin due to aged skin or sunlight exposure etc. are prevented or improved, is one of such effects, and therefore, an external skin treatment compositions such as cosmetic compositions having such purposes have been desired.Under such circumstances, various raw materials extracted from natural products, such as proteins, polysaccharides, extracted extracts, natural polymers etc. have been heretofore formulated in external skin treatment compositions due to their characteristics application effects.Recently, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 64-500355 discloses a method for preventing or improving the changes or disabilities caused due to aged skins or sunlight exposure by formulating thereinto at least one component selected from vitamin A and the derivatives thereof.However, the effects thereof are not sufficient and it has been strongly desired to develop a pharmaceutically effective agent having much more excellent effects.European patent application 0 512 814 discloses topical compositions for preventing or reducing the damaging effects of ultra-violet light on skin comprising 1-hydroxycholecalciferol and/or 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol in combination with a sunscreen material and optionally retinol or a derivative thereof.German patent application DE-A-1 792 514 discloses cosmetic formulations comprising glucidamines which essentially comprise three fractions :
a) partially depolymerized glycoproteins containing hexoses, hexosamines and short chain proteins;b) depolymerized polysaccharides consisting of hexosamines and uronic acids;c) sulfonated polysaccharides containing -SO3H groups, partially acetylated hexosamines and uronic acids.These compositions are useful for treatment of cellulitis and skin dehydration, for epidemic regeneration and for the treatment of wrinkles and of the breast.US Patent NÂ° 5 013 726 relates to an external analgesic lotion containing as active ingredients methyl salicylate, camphor and menthol. This lotion can
