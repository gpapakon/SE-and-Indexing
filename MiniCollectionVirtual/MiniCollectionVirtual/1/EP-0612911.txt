<ABSTRACT>
The sealing sheet web (1) can be fixed in a simple manner on a frame profile (5) or on a structural profile which is assigned to the frame profile and belongs to a building structure. The sealing sheet web (1) is provided, on the fastening border, with a weatherstrip seal (2) which can be plugged into an undercut groove of the frame profile or of the structural profile assigned to the frame profile. By using a weatherstrip seal as fastening means of the sealing sheet web, not only is the fixing of the sealing sheet web on the structural profile ensured in an extremely simple manner, but drawbacks resulting from measures taken by workmen are also ruled out.
