<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a ceramic heater of 
current self-control type, which has no gap in the 

boundary between the enclosure 1 and the filler 2, and 
which has reduced manufacturing cost, a stable 

strength and an improved heating performance. The 
invention also provides a method of manufacturing such 

a ceramic heater. In this ceramics heater, porous 
ceramic fillers 2, 3 are filled inside the end 

portions of the enclosure 1 made of a dense ceramics. 
The metal coil 10 consisting of the heater coil 6 and 

the current control coil 9 connected in series with 
each other is installed inside the enclosure 1, with 

the end surfaces 15 of the enclosure 1 hermetically 
closed by the sealing films 4. To prevent corrosion 

of the metal coil 10, the low heat conductivity 
ceramics 25 made from ceramic whiskers and/or ceramic 

powder is disposed in the central portion of the 
enclosure 1 and an N

 gas is sealed therein. The 
heater coil 6 is arranged in contact with the inner 

wall surface 7 of that portion of the enclosure 1 
where the filler 2 is located, and the current control 

coil 9 is spaced from the inner wall surface 8 of the 
enclosure 1 so as to be heat-insulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ceramic heater
that forms a ceramic glow plug used with diesel
engines and also to a method of manufacturing the
ceramic heater.A ceramic glow plug conventionally has its heater
portion consisting of a high-melting point metal such
as tungsten and an Si3N4 formed integral during a hot-press
process. A conventional current self-control
type glow plug is not satisfactory in terms of heat
durability, strength against thermal shocks and high-temperature
resistance when it is used in high-temperature
combustion chambers in heat-insulated
engines. Because the self-control type glow plug is
made by connecting a heating coil made from a tungsten
wire and a resistor coil made from a nickel wire, both
with different resistance-temperature coefficients,
there are drawbacks of complex structure, high cost 
and insufficient strength.In the conventional current self-control type
glow plug, the metal coil such as tungsten wire is
embedded in ceramics and sintered during the forming
process, so that the sintering requires application of
pressure. Hence, a hot-press, i.e., a single axis
pressure sintering is usually performed. The metal
coil embedded in the ceramics is therefore limited in
the shape and takes a two-dimensional structure,
giving rise to a problem that a gap is formed between
the wall surface of the ceramic enclosure and the
metal coil, reducing the heat conductivity and the
quick-heating capability of the ceramic heater.In the ceramics glow plug whose heater portion
consists of a tungsten wire and an Si3N4 formed
integral during the hot-press process, a gap is formed
in the boundary between the tungsten wire and the
Si3N4, resulting in ingress of water or oxygen through
the gap to cause corrosion. To prevent entry of water
or oxygen from the gap between the tungsten wire and
the Si3N4 requires that the gap be sealed. For this
purpose, a glass sealing may be employed but this
increases the number of steps in the manufacture
process, lowering the reliability.In a glow plug disclosed in Japanese Utility 
Model No. 15077/1989, the heater portion is formed of
a sintered ceramics that consists of a heater coated
with a ceramic coating layer applied by a vapor
deposition method.In a ceramics heater disclosed in JP-A-1157084/1989, a heating resistor wire
formed of a high melting point metal such as tungsten
(W), molybdenum (Mo) and rhenium (Re) or their alloys
is embedded in an Si3N4 sintered body and an
intermediate layer, which is made from the same metal
elements as the
