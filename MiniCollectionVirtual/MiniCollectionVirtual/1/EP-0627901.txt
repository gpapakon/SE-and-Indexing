<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an intraocular lens
(IOL) and more particularly to an IOL with a deformable
optic which enables the IOL to be passed through a
scleral tunnel incision no longer than about 3.2 mm into
the eye.When the natural lens of the human eye becomes
impaired through, for example, cataracts or injury, it
is common practice to replace the natural lens with an
IOL. One way to accomplish this is to form a relatively
long incision in the eye and remove the natural lens in
one piece. However, presently a much more common way to
accomplish this is to form a shorter incision in the eye
and insert a probe or a phaco tip of a
phacoemulsification instrument through the incision into
the eye to break up the natural lens using ultrasonic
energy. The lens fragments are then aspirated from the
eye through the relatively short phaco incision and the
phaco tip is removed.The length of the incision, which is commonly
referred to as a phaco incision, in the eye through which
the phaco tip is inserted is typically no greater than
about 3.2 mm so that the phaco tip will fit somewhat
snugly through the incision. It is generally recognized
that the longer the lens-removal incision, the greater 
the trauma to the eye and the longer the patient recovery
time. Other complications may also be caused by a large
incision such as the need to remove the lens in one
piece. About 80 percent of the lens-removal processes
currently use phacoemulsification techniques. Of course,
with only a small incision being needed for
phacoemulsification lens extraction, it is desirable that
IOL's be available and used that can be inserted through
the small phaco incisions.A typical IOL includes an optic, usually having
a diameter of about 6 mm, and fixation members coupled
to (or formed with) the optic to fix the optic within
the eye in the region of the extracted lens. IOL's are
of two basic types, those having a hard or rigid optic
formed, for example, of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)
and those having a deformable optic which is constructed
of a deformable material such as silicone, hydrogel, or
an acrylic. If a hard IOL is used, the 3.2 mm incision
must be enlarged to approximately the diameter of the
hard optic, in order to permit the hard optic to be
inserted through the incision and much of the advantage
of phacoemulsification lens extraction is thereby
obviously lost.There are two known classes of prior art IOL's
which can be deformed (e.g., folded or rolled) to pass
through a scleral tunnel incision of about 3.2 mm in
length. A
