<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser which is used for the metered discharge of a liquid from a container (22) has a piston pump (10, 12); a suction line (18) which leads from the container (22) to the pump (10, 12) and in which there is a suction valve (26); a pressure line (20) which leads from the pump (10, 12) to an outlet (24) and in which there is a pressure valve (28); and a return line path (32), which can be opened by means of actuating intervention and leads back from the pressure line (20) into the container (22). The return line path (32) branches off from the pressure line (20) upstream of the pressure valve (28).

<CLAIMS>
A dispenser for dispensing fluid from a container
(22), with a pump (10,12,14), with a suction line (18) which

leads from the container (22) to the pump (10, 12, 14) and in
which an automatic suction valve (26) is disposed, with a

pressure line (20) which leads from the pump (12) to an
outlet (24) and in which an automatic pressure valve (28) is

disposed, and with a return line (32) from the pressure line
(20) back into the container, which can be opened by

actuating engagement, 
characterised in that
 the return line
(32) starts from the pressure line (20) upstream of the

pressure valve (28).
A dispenser according to Claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the return line (32) can be alternately shut off and
opened by a valve (34,36) disposed therein.
A dispenser according to Claim 2, 
characterised in
that
 the valve (36) in the return line (32) is automatic.
A dispenser according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 a non-return valve (36) is disposed in
the return line (32), which opens towards the container (22)

actuated by hydraulic pressure.
A dispenser according to Claim 4, 
characterised in
that
 the opening actuating pressure of the non-return valve
(36) is higher than the opening actuating pressure of the

pressure valve (28).
A dispenser according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,

characterised in that
 a controlled directional valve (34) is 
disposed in the return line (32), which shuts off the return

line (32) in one operating position and opens it in another
operating position.
A dispenser according to Claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the directional valve in the return line (32) is a 2/2-way
valve.
A dispenser according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 a controlled directional valve (30; 38)
is disposed in the pressure line (20), which shuts off the

pressure line (20) in one operating position and opens its
in another operating position.
A dispenser according to Claim 8, 
characterised in
that
 the directional valve in the pressure line (20) is a
2/2-way valve (30) or a 3/2-way valve (38).
A dispenser according to Claim 8 or 9,

characterised in that
 the directional valve (30;38) in the
pressure line (20) is disposed upstream of the pressure

valve (28).
A dispenser according to Claim 8 or 9,

characterised in that
 the directional valve (30; 38) in the
pressure line (20) is disposed downstream of the pressure

valve (28).
A dispenser according to Claims 6 and 10,

characterised in that
 a 3/2-way valve (38) is disposed in
the pressure line (20), which in one operating position

opens the pressure line (20) and shuts off the return line
(32) and in the other operating position shuts off the

pressure line (20) and opens the return line (32).+
