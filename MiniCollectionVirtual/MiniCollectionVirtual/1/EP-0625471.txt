<ABSTRACT>
A control apparatus is provided for use in an 
article handling system having a conduit (12) through which 

articles (25) such as can ends in a facewise nested condition 
are conveyed from a first location (14) to a second location 

(16). The control apparatus comprises a housing (40) 
operatively interposed in the conduit (12) and an elastomeric 

tubular sleeve member (42) mounted in the housing (40) and 
defining a through passage (44) of a shape generally 

complementary to the shape of the articles (25). The tubular 
sleeve member (42) is responsive to the level of pressure in 

a pressure chamber (46) for applying a corresponding force 
about the periphery of the articles (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus 
for handling articles such as can ends or the like. More 
particularly, the invention concerns a novel and improved 
control apparatus for use with an article handling system for 
controlling or regulating the flow of articles in a desired 
fashion at various points in the system. While the invention may find application in other 
article handling situations, the description will be 
facilitated hereinafter by specific reference to the problem 
of handling and processing can ends. The manufacture and 
handling of can ends has become a highly automated process, 
employing high speed manufacturing and handling apparatus and 
requiring rapid transfer of the articles or can ends from one 
work station to another. The manufacturing operation may 
include a number of machines which perform various 
fabrication, counting, and packaging steps on the can ends.  
 
Generally speaking, the can ends are carried in elongate 
conduits in a facewise nested condition between one work 
station in the system and the next. The apparatus of the invention may also find use in 
can end handling operations attendant to the final end user. 
For example, the invention may be used with apparatus which 
accumulates a large number of stacks or sticks of can ends of 
a predetermined length or number and discharges these sticks 
of can ends as required into an infeed for a filling or 
canning operation. Such operations may at some points utilize 
various gases for sterilization and/or isolation of the 
product filling process from other components. For example, 
some liquid products are filled in a nitrogen atmosphere to 
substantially limit or eliminate oxygen inside of the can or 
other container. As will be more fully explained hereinbelow, 
the apparatus of the invention may advantageously be utilized 
as a gas seal unit in can end conduits feeding such a filling 
apparatus. In addition to the foregoing gas seal application, 
the control apparatus of the invention may be used in a number 
of other applications wherein it is desired to control the 
flow of articles between one work station or location and the 
next. For example, in some applications it is desired to 
provide a so-called air gap or control gap at some point in 
the conduit. When the can ends or other articles back up in 
the conduit and fill this control gap or conversely, should 
the articles advance completely out of the air gap or control 
gap, a signal may be provided to indicate that the supply of 
articles

comprising: a housing (40) operatively interposed in said 
conduit (12); an elastomeric tubular sleeve member (42) 

mounted in said housing (40) and defining a through passage 
(44) of a shape generally complementary to the shape of said 

articles (25); means defining a pressure chamber (46); said 
tubular sleeve member (42) being responsive to the level of 

pressure in said pressure chamber (46) for applying a force 
about the periphery of said articles (25). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and further 
including a through opening (48) in said housing (40) 

communicating with said pressure chamber (46) and control 
means (52) operatively coupled with said through opening (48) 

of said housing (40) for controlling the pressure in said 
pressure chamber (46). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 and further 
including level sensor means (30,32) responsive to the level 

of articles in said conduit (12) at a location downstream of 
said housing (40) with respect to the direction of flow of 

articles through said conduit (12) for producing a first 
control signal when said level is below a preselected level 

and a second control signal when the level is above a 
preselected level. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said 
housing (40) comprises a generally cylindrical outer wall 

member (60) and a pair of annular end members (62,64) coupled 
to opposite ends of said outer wall member (60) and extending 

 
radially inwardly thereof for engaging said tubular sleeve 

member (42) therebetween. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, and further 
including sealing means (78) interposed between each of said 

end members (62,64) and said tubular sleeve member (42).
