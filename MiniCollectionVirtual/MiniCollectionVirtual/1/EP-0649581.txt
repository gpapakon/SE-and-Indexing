<ABSTRACT>
A pure ATM based multiplex is incapable, especially at low carrier rates, of satisfactorily carrying constant bit rate traffic or human communication traffic. A multiplex format having a plurality of constant bit rate timeslots in which a timeslot is not in use for constant bit rate traffic can have that timeslot used for message based traffic to provide a composite constant bit rate/message based data stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTIPLEX FORMATS FOR ATMA multiplexer/demultiplexer (mux/demux) is proposed which, for example, as a basic requirement is able to carry constant bit rate services based on a regular 125 microseconds time base as well as statistical traffic based on ATM cells.It should be understood that when multiplexing of a signal is carried out it is necessary to provide a multiplexer to carry out the multiplexing and a demultiplexer at the far end of the signal connection to recover the original. Additionally, to provide two way communication, a multiplexer and a demultiplexer are necessary at each end of the connection. Frequently a multiplexer and a demultiplexer are combined in a single multiplexer/demultiplexer unit.The use of the term multiplexer should accordingly be considered as applying to a multiplexer, a demultiplexer or a u1tiplexer/demultiplexer as appropriate.For a combination of reasons, a pure ATM based multiplex is incapable, especially at low carrier rates, of satisfactorily carrying constant bit rate traffic, or human communication traffic.The format described provides an efficient transport medium for the part of the telecommunication network where the cost of bandwidth is the most expensive, such as the subscriber interface and leased megastrea circuits. It could also be applicable to the concentrator to host interface.According to the present invention there is provided a multiplex format comprising a plurality of constant bit rate time slots wherein a time slot which is not in use for constant bit rate traffic is used for message based traffic to provide a composite constant bit rate/message based data stream.There is further provided a multiplex comprising means to operate using a multiplex format as above.A connected pair of multiplexers may be in a master/slave relationship.The present invention will now be described by way ofSUBSTITUTESWEET(RULE26)

CLAIMS
1. A multiplex format comprising a plurality of constant bit rate time slots wherein a time slot which is not in use for constant bit rate traffic is used for message based traffic to provide a composite constant bit rate/message based data stream.
2. A multiplex format as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the message based traffic is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) traffic.
3. A multiplex format as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein time slot allocation control information is carried in time slot 16.
4. A multiplex format as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein time slot allocation control information is carried by use of spare bits.
5. A multiplex format as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein time slot allocation control information is carried by an SDH communications channel as a path overhead.
6. A multiplex format as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein time slot allocation is carried out manually.
7. A multiplexer comprising means to operate using a multiplex format as claimed in any preceding claim.
8. A multiplexer as claimed in Claim 7 including means to provide synchronised change of time slot allocation.
