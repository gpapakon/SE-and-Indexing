A method of washing a textile web (1) permeable to 
steam and continuously conveyed in a spread-out 

position, wherein steam at excess pressure is blown on 
to the web (1) from one side and the mixture of steam, 

liquid and residues removed from the web (1) is 
collected on the other side of the web (1) after 

passing through it, characterised in that the steam is 
blown at an excess pressure of at least 0.5 bar and 

collected on the other side near the blowing site and 
simultaneously with blowing, using a powerful negative 

pressure of at least 0.2 bar, in such a manner that 
large organic molecules for removal from the web are 

stimulated by the energy supplied by the steam until 
they decompose or split up, and in this more mobile 

state they are removed from the web (1). 
A full-width washing machine for a textile web (1) 
permeable to steam, comprising 


an injection device (10) having an outlet opening (10') 
directed from one side against the web (1) and 

extending over the width thereof, 
a collecting device connected to a pump and having an 

inlet opening (20') directed from the other side 
against the web (1), extending over the width thereof, 

and in the neighbourhood of and opposite the outlet 
opening (10'), and  

 
a conveyor for conveying the web (1) between the outlet 
opening (10') of the injection device (10) and the 

inlet opening (20') of the collecting device, 
 
characterised in that
 
the collecting device is constructed in the form of a 

suction device (20) engaging the web (1), and the 
outlet opening (10') of the injection device (10) and 

the inlet opening (20') of the suction device (20) are 
so disposed relative to one another and to the web (1) 

and the injection device (10) and the suction device 
(20) are so constructed that steam at an excess 

pressure of at least 0.5 bar prevailing in the 
injection device (10) is injected into the web (1) and 

through the web (1) simultaneously with the injection, 
at a negative pressure of at least 0.2 bar prevailing 

in the suction device (20) and extracted from the web 
(1) in such a manner that large organic molecules for 

removal from the web (1) are stimulated by the energy 
supplied by the steam until they decompose or split up, 

and in this more mobile state they are removed from the 
web (1). 
A method according to claim 1 or a full-width 
washing machine according to claim 2, characterised in 

that the negative pressure is at least 0.5 bar. 
A full-width washing machine according to claim 2 
or 3, characterised in that the outlet opening (10') 

and the inlet opening (20') are opposite and overlap 
one another relative to the plane of the web (1).  

 
A full-width washing machine according to claim 2 
or 3, characterised in that the outlet opening (10') 

and the inlet opening (20') are offset from one another 
in the direction of conveyance (1') of the web (1). 
A full-width washing machine according to any of 
claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the extent (41, 

51) of the outlet opening (10') and of the inlet 
opening (20') in the direction of conveyance (1') of 

the web (1) is the same. 
A full-width washing machine according to any of 
claims 2 to 5, characterised in that the extent (51', 

51") of the inlet opening (20') in the direction of 
conveyance (1') of the web (1) is greater than the 

corresponding extent (41) of the outlet opening (10). 
A full-width washing machine according to any of 
claims 2 to 7, characterised in that the outlet opening 

(10') and/or the inlet opening (20') are slots. 
A full-width washing machine according to claim 8, 
characterised in that the outlet opening (10') and/or 

the inlet opening (20') are defined by slit jets (40, 
50; 40', 50'; 40", 50"; 11, 12). 
A full-width washing machine according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the slit jets (40, 50; 11, 21) 

are resiliently pressed against one another with 
interposition of the web (1). 
A full-width washing machine according to claim 9 
or 10, characterised in that at least one (40) slit jet  

 
is at a slight distance (42) from the web (1) at right 

angles to its surfaces. 
A full-width washing machine according to any of 
claims 2 to 11, characterised in that the positions of 

the outlet opening (10') and/or the inlet opening (20')

A full-width washing machine according to claim 
12, characterised by an open-loop and closed-loop 

control device which is connected to the injection 
device (10), the suction device (20), the steamgenerating 

device (19) and/or the suction pump (55) and 
is so constructed that the injection and extraction 

process is controllable in dependence on parameters of 
the web (1). 
A full-width washing machine according to claim 
13, characterised in that the open-loop and closed-loop
