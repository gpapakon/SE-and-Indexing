<ABSTRACT>
A cost-effective, bandwidth-efficient, and power-efficient system is provided in which 
data streams received from several different video sources are converted into sequences of 

symbols selected from a predetermined constellation and are multiplexed on a symbol-by-symbol 
basis into a single sequence of symbols for transmission on a channel. Using a 

symbol multiplexer helps to mitigate the effect of bursty noise in the receiver and reduces the 
processing speed requirement in the receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital communications systems and, more particularly, to
systems for transmitting digital signals over cable television networks.As information service providers offer more services through cable television, the
demand for cable television bandwidth will greatly increase. Similarly, the introduction of
high definition television (HDTV) channels, which require a significantly larger bandwidth
than conventional television channels, will consume a large portion of the available cable
television bandwidth. The number of cable television channels and bandwidth available,
however, are limited.Over-the-air and cable television channels are susceptible to both Gaussian and impulse
noise. As a result, schemes for increasing the bandwidth efficiency of these channels must
provide immunity to both Gaussian and impulse noise. Prior art systems which provide such
noise immunity are complex and thus expensive, particularly where the data rate across a
channel is high. However, consumer products, such as cable television reception equipment,
must be reasonably priced if those products are to be widely successful in the marketplace.EP-A- 0 490 552 discloses a modulator for HDTV signals in which more
important bits and less important bits are separately coded and mapped into symbols of
different constellations. The two series of symbols are combined by alternately taking a
number of symbols from one stream and a number from the other, thus providing
greater error protection for the more important bits.The invention is as set out in the independent claims, preferred forms
being set out in the dependent claims.A cost-effective, bandwidth-efficient, and power-efficient system is provided in which  
data streams received from several different video sources are converted into symbols of a
predetermined constellation and are multiplexed on a symbol-by-symbol basis into a single
sequence of symbols for transmission on a channel. The system includes a transmitter having
a symbol multiplexer and a receiver which operates at a reduced processing speed to output
symbols that correspond to data from a selected one of the different video sources.
Multiplexing on a symbol-by-symbol basis mitigates the effect of bursty (impulse) noise on
the channel.In the drawings:

<CLAIMS>
A transmitter comprising:

means (102) for generating an individual sequence of bit groups for each
of a plurality of sources, each bit group corresponding to a symbol of a predetermined

constellation;
means (104) for multiplexing the plurality of sequences of bit groups
output by the plurality of sources into a single sequence of bit groups, where the

multiplexing is performed on a bit group-by-bit group basis by taking, in turn, one bit-group
from each of said individual sequences;
means for generating a sequence of symbols, each symbol representing
one of said bit groups in said single sequence; and
means (106) for generating a transmitted signal that represents said
sequence of symbols.
A transmitter comprising:

means (102) for generating an individual sequence of symbols for each of
a plurality of sources, each symbol in the sequences of symbols being a symbol of a

predetermined constellation;
means (104) for multiplexing said plurality of individual sequences of
symbols into a single sequence of symbols, where the multiplexing is performed on a

symbol-by-symbol basis by multiplexing, in turn, one symbol from each of said
individual sequences; and
means (106) for generating a transmitted signal that represents said single
sequence of symbols.
A transmitter as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
predetermined constellation is a QAM constellation.
A transmitter as claimed in any of the preceding claims, wherein the
sequence generating means includes:


means for receiving a stream of input bits from each of the plurality of
sources; and 
means (300, 302, 304) for encoding each received stream of input bits
with an error-correcting code.
A transmitter as claimed in claim 4 wherein the error-correcting code
is a Reed-Solomon code, trellis coded modulation, or concatenated Reed-Solomon code

and trellis coded modulation.
A transmitter as claimed in any of the preceding claims, adapted for
transmitting a signal over a cable television channel.
Apparatus for receiving from a channel a signal that was generated by
processing a plurality of streams of input bits to produce respective sequences of bit

groups and multiplexing the plurality of sequences of bit groups into a single sequence
of bit groups, the multiplexing being performed on a bit group-by-bit group basis, and

by thereafter providing, in said generated signal, symbols selected from a predetermined
constellation in response to the bit groups in the single sequence of bit groups, said

receiver apparatus comprising:

   means (202, 204, 206) for recovering from said received signal a selected
one of the plurality of streams of input bits.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 wherein the recovering means
comprises an equalizer means (204) which receives signal samples at a rate which is at

least the same as the rate at which symbols are transmitted over the channel, the
equalizer means being capable of generating a sequence of equalized symbols at a rate

which is lower than the symbol rate.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8 for use with a received

signal generated by encoding with an error-correcting code, wherein the recovering
means further comprises means (Fig. 8) for decoding the received signal to recover a

selected one of the plurality of streams of input bits.
