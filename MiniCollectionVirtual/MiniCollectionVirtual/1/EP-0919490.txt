<ABSTRACT>
Folding container, comprised of: two equal frames
(1, 2), parallel and superposed, at least one pair of

folding arms (5, 6) in the manner of flat structured
elements in the shape of scissors, which relate the two

frames, a series of intermediate detachable trays (18, 19),
assembled at different heights between each pair of folding

arms; and at least two stiff mounting columns (20),
comprised of a least two telescopic sections (21, 22) said

columns being articulated at an end to the top frame (1),
whilst at the opposite end they are anchored to the lower

frame (2). Arms (5, 6) permitting the relative movement of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a folding and
reusable container, especially conceived for products in
bulk, provided with supporting wheels to facilitate its
movement, and which may change from a mounted position,
with great loading capacity to a folded position in which
its volume is considerably reduced.Folding containers for the described purpose are
already known, which include a platform with or without
supporting wheels, and walls which articulate or connect to
said platform and which are capable of occupying a mounted
position, in which they are placed perpendicular to the
platform, delimiting a chamber or cavity capable of being
filled with the product to be transported, and a folding
position, in which the walls remain collapsed and
superposed on the platform, or else folded and separated
from the same.US-A-5 033 758 discloses a container
substantially in accordance with the preamble
of claim 1 of this patent.In any case, the container delimits a hollow or
enclosure which is filled with the product to be
transported, laying units over other units in such a
manner, that this type of containers cannot be used for the
transportation of delicate articles, such as specific types
of fruit, the transportation of which must be carried out
on individual trays on which one or two layers of products
can be placed. The object of the present invention is to solve
the problems pointed out, by means of a container of great
capacity, which permits the transportation of delicate
articles, without risk of deterioration, and which serves
for the transportation and storage of the products
contained and also as exhibitor of the same, in such a way,
that once the container has been loaded, it is not
necessary to handle or touch the product again, until its
final shipment or sale.More precisely, the problems pointed out are
solved by the features defined in claim 1. Further,
preferred embodiments of the invention are
defined in dependent claims 2-9.Additionally, the container of the invention is
provided with wheels, so that it facilitates its movement
over storehouses and selling surfaces.An added advantage of the invention is that both
the folding and the mounting operations can be performed in
a highly simple and rapid manner.The container of the invention is constituted by
a highly resistant folding structure, comprised for example
of steel, making it reusable and capable of being subjected
to any type of cleaning operations, to ensure its hygienic
conditions.The container of the invention is comprised of
two
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Folding container, comprising:

two equal, parallel and superposed frames (1, 2);
at least one pair of folding arms (5) which relate
said frames; and
at least two stiff mounting columns (20);

   wherein

   the folding arms (5) consist of flat structured
elements in the shape of scissors, based on a pair of

articulated flat bars, said flat structured elements
permitting the relative movement of the frames (1, 2) from

positions of maximum and minimum separation; and

   the stiff mounting columns (20) are made up of at
least two telescopic sections (21, 22) which are

articulated at an end to the lower frame (2) according to
aligned parallel axes which permit the tilting of said

columns (20) between a top collapsed position on the upper
frame (1) and a vertical mounted position, in which they

bear on said lower frame (2) ensuring the stability of the
assembly with the frames (1, 2) in the maximum separation

situation;

   
characterised in that
 it further comprises

   a series of intermediate detachable trays (18, 51),
assembled at different heights between each pair of folding

arms (5);

   and 
in that

   one of each pair of end flat bars is articulated by
its free end to the adjacent frame, whilst the other is

slidable along the length of a section of said frame. 
Container according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 it also includes pairs of folding arms (6) which
are assembled between upper and lower crosspieces (3, 4) of

the frames (1, 2), said crosspieces (3, 4) being constituted by
confronted "U" shaped profiles which run according to the

axes of said frames (1, 2).
Container according to claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 columns (20) include a lower reduced height section
(22), which is attached by its lower end to frame (2), and 

an upper telescopic post (21'), which is articulated to the
lower section (22) by an axis (30) parallel to one of the

frame (2) sides, around the axis (30) of which, it may tilt
between a mounted position, at which it remains as an

extension of the lower section (22), and a folded position,
at which it is collapsed towards the inside of the mounting

in approximately parallel position to one of the frame (1,
2) sides; both sections (21', 22) of telescopic posts (20)

being related by a set of levers which control the relative
position of said sections and the top section (21') of each

post (20) being provided at its top free end and the top
frame, with confronted mutual coupling elements.
Container according to claim 3, 
characterised
in that
 the posts (20) are associated in two pairs, the
set of levers which relate the sections of said posts

including a "U" shaped lever (32), the side branches of
which articulate by their free end to the external section

of each pair of associated posts (20), and a bar (35) which
articulates by an end to an intermediate point of one of

the side branches of the "U" shaped lever (32) and by the
other, to the internal section of adjacent telescopic post

(20); the bars (35) on the same side of the two pairs of
posts (20), being of greater length than those of the

opposite side, so as to raise, in each pair of posts (20),
the internal sections in different magnitudes.
Container according to claim 3, 
characterised
in that
 the lower section (22) of the columns (20) is of
tubular configuration, with sufficient diameter to receive

the lower portion of the corresponding post (21'), both
elements being related by a diametrical pin (30) which acts

as rotational axis of the post (21') and may move along the
length of respective axial grooves (29) which the tubular

section presents on its wall, the wall of said lower 
section (22) being also provided, as from the top edge, of

an axial notch (31) of approximately equal width or
slightly larger than the diameter of post (21'), to permit

the collapse of said mast.
Container according to claim 3, 
characterised
in that
 each pair of coplanar folding arms (5) are
internally provided with transversal profiles (50), placed

at equal height on the two pairs of arms (5), to determine
guides for the assembly of trays (51).
Container according to claim 3, 
characterised
in that
 the confronted folding arms (5) are related by a
tensile element (46) housed on the intermediate side of

lower frame (2), which impulses said arms (5) towards its
unfolded position.
Container according to claim 3, 
characterised
in that
 on the lower section of the columns (20) are
telescopically fitted together, parting from their lower

end, a leg (42) which is pushed in ascending direction,
towards a retracted position by means of a spring assembled

between said section and leg, the associated post (5)
resting on said leg (42)
Container according to claims 1 and 3

characterised in that
 it is provided, at each corner of the

base, with a brake-support of individual activation,
constituted by a tubing (56) forming integral part with

frame (2), on which a second tubing (42) is telescopically
assembled, provided with a projection (61) on which an

elbowed lever (63) is rotationally assembled, finished off
at its end by a slide (64) which bears and moves on the

frame of base (2), the support foot (47) being constantly
pushed towards its top position by means of a spring (58) 

assembled between the lower part (61) of the tubing (56)
and the nut (60) of the screw (59) which attaches the

support foot (47).
