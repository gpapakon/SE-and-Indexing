<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring the speed of land vehicles has two magnetic field sensors (14 or 15), arranged at a distance (d) from one another in the direction of travel, for detecting changes in the terrestrial magnetic field, and has an evaluation unit (21) which determines the shift in phase or time of the electric output signals of the magnetic field sensors (14, 15) and calculates the vehicle speed (v) therefrom and from the distance (d) of the magnetic field sensors (14, 15). In order to ensure a satisfactorily accurate and reliably reproducible speed measurement in road traffic, the two magnetic field sensors (14 or 15) are arranged along and immediately adjacent to a route (10). The spatial distance (d) between the magnetic field sensors (14 or 15) is kept smaller than the minimum distance (a) between successive vehicles (10). It is preferred for the distance (d) between the sensors to be selected only half as large or smaller than this minimum distance (a) between vehicles.

Apparatus for measuring the speed of land vehicles with two
sensors (14, 15) arranged at a distance (d) one behind the

other along a road (10) and next to this, and with an
evaluation unit (21), which is connected to the sensors

(14, 15), and which determines the phase and time
displacement of the electric output signals of the sensors

(14, 15) and calculates the vehicle speed (v) from this
with the distance (d) between the sensors (14, 15),

characterised in that the sensors are provided in the form
of magnetic field sensors (14, 15), which detect

interferences in the terrestrial magnetic field caused by
the passing vehicle, and that determination of the time

displacement of the output signals of the two magnetic
field sensors (14, 15) is achieved in such a manner that

the signal amplitudes (A1, A2) of the output signals are
compared with at least one pre-set threshold value (S),

that the time difference (T1) between the signal amplitudes
(A1, A2) of the two output signals exceeding the threshold

value (S) and the time difference (T2) between the signal
amplitudes (A1, A2) of the two output signals falling short

of the threshold value (S) are measured, and that the
arithmetic mean of the measured time differences (T1, T2)

is output as a temporal displacement of the output signals.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
plurality of threshold values (S) are pre-set, that the

median value is determined from the plurality of time
difference values relating to the thresholds (S) being

exceeded and being fallen short of, and that the arithmetic
mean is formed from the time difference values lying

closest to the median value.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the magnetic field sensors (14, 15) are three-dimensionally 

sensitive, and that the electric output signal of the
magnetic field sensors (14, 15) is formed by vector

addition of the output signals of the three sensor
components.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the distance of the magnetic field sensors (14, 15)

from the road (10) is as short as possible.
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the mutual distance (d) between the magnetic field

sensors (14, 15) is equal to or less than half of an
assumed minimum distance (a) between vehicles (11)

following in succession.
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
mutual distance between the magnetic field sensors (14, 15)

amounts to about 5 m.
