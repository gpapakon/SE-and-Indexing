<ABSTRACT>
The centrifugal pump has a pump casing (1) with an inlet line (10) and a discharge line (5). Provided in the pump casing (1) is a pump chamber (2) which contains a pump impeller (3). The pump chamber is moreover connected to a propellant chamber (4) and, via the latter, to the discharge line (5). Arranged ahead of the pump impeller (3) is a jet-pump diffuser (6), the inlet of which is connected to the inlet line (10) and is acted upon by a primary nozzle (11). The inlet of the latter is connected to a feed passage (12) connected to the propellant chamber (4). A bypass line (13) leads from the inlet line (10) to the outlet of the diffuser (6), bypassing the inlet (9) of the latter, and contains a self-closing valve (13) which shuts off the bypass line (13) when air is drawn in and opens under the action of the negative pressure created by the diffuser (6) when the pump is delivering only liquid. This increases the intake and delivery rate since the liquid no longer has to pass only through the restricted diffuser inlet but can also flow through the bypass line.

Self-priming centrifugal pump including a pump 
chamber (2), which contains the pump impeller (3) and 

which is connected on the pressure side to a working 
fluid chamber (4) and, together with the latter, to the 

discharge passage of the pump housing (1), a jet pump 
diffuser (6), the broadened outlet (7) of which 

discharges into the pump chamber (2) before the inlet 
opening (8) of the pump impeller (3) and whose 

constricted inlet (9) is connected to the suction passage 
(10) in the pump housing (1), and a jet pump drive nozzle 

(11), which is connected via a supply passage (12) to the 
working fluid chamber (4) and whose mouth cooperates 

within the suction passage (10) with the diffuser inlet 
(9) in the manner of an injector, a bypass line (13), 

which leads to the diffuser outlet (7) adjacent to the 
impeller suction opening (8) and bypasses the diffuser 

inlet (9) cooperating with the drive nozzle (11), being 
connected to the suction passage (10) in the pump housing 

(1) and including a valve (14) closing the bypass line 
(13), characterised in that the valve (14) is an 

automatic valve whose valve body (15) opens the bypass 
line (13) in the direction from the suction passage (10) 

to the impeller suction opening (8), whereby the closing 
force acting on the valve body (15) opposite to this 

opening direction is smaller than the pump suction force 
in the diffuser outlet acting on the valve at full 

discharge capacity of the centrifugal pump. 
Self-priming centrifugal pump as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the pump chamber (2) contains a 

pump impeller (3) rotating about a substantially 
horizontal axis and communicates at the peripheral region  

 
of the pump impeller with a coaxially arranged working 

fluid chamber, the housing discharge line (5) being 
connected to the upper region of the working fluid 

chamber (4) and the supply passage (12) leading to the 
drive nozzle (11) being connected to the lower region of 

the working fluid chamber and the housing suction passage 
(10) having a section (16) which is situated higher than 

the outlet of the drive nozzle (11) in the diffuser inlet 
(9). 
Self-priming centrifugal pump as claimed in claim 1 
or 2, characterised in that the valve (14) in the 

discharge line (13) includes a valve body (15), which 
closes automatically under gravity and preferably 

comprises a ball, the specific gravity of which is 
greater by a predetermined amount than the specific 

gravity of the liquid to be conveyed.
