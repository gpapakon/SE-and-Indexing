<ABSTRACT>
Image data of Y, M, C and K color separations 
received from a layout system through an interface 

circuit are applied through a color computation circuit 
to a chemical element adjusting LUT (lookup table). 

The chemical element adjusting LUT identifies coloring 
densities based on the image data of the color separations 

and chemical conditions set through a setter for 
forming cells. The coloring densities of the color 

separations are applied to a signal editing circuit. 
The coloring density of K separation is separated into 

three chromatic color components which are added to the 
coloring densities of the three chromatic color separations, 

taking superposition with the coloring densities 
of the three chromatic color separations into account. 

Resulting signals are converted into voltages for 
application to AOMs, and applied to input terminals of 

multiplexers for the three respective chromatic color 
separations. A dot generator stores gravure screens 

with an overall screen pattern with angles affixed 
thereto. Upon receipt of an image data output start 

signal from the layout system, the dot generator 
determines cell portions and gravure screen wall 

portions synchronously with the coloring density 
identifying process. For the cell portions, the  

 
multiplexers are controlled to apply to the AOMs the 

voltages corresponding to the coloring densities 
identified. The AOMs modulate light beams based on the 

voltages applied thereto, to expose halftone images 
having the coloring densities identified, on a 

photosensitive material according to cell patterns. 
Consequently, a color proof is obtained for prints to 

be made with printing cylinders prepared by the conventional 
gravure system. In an adding process for 

portions where K separation and chromatic colors are 
superposed, the coloring densities are added after 

decreasing the coloring densities of the color separations 
encountering a trapping shortage, by a density 

reduction due to additivity failure. This realizes a 
color proof with a compensation effected for the 

additivity failure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to image proofing apparatus 
for use in gravure printing, in which halftone images 
with coloring densities adjusted according to conditions 
for forming cells on a gravure cylinder are 
exposed in cell patterns on a photosensitive material 
mounted on the cylinder to record a proof image on the 
photosensitive material. In gravure printing, gravure ink is filled into 
minute depressions called cells which are formed in an 
orderly pattern on a printing cylinder, and the ink is 
transferred onto printing paper or the like. Density 
tones of prints are expressed by the varying depth 
and/or area of the cells. Known techniques of making gravure plates for 
preparing such printing cylinders include the conventional 
gravure system, halftone gravure system and 
electronic engraving system. The features of these 
systems will be described hereinafter. This system expresses density tones by varying the  
 
cell depth while maintaining the cell area constant. 
In this system, a continuous tone positive and a 
gravure screen with an overall screen pattern are 
successively exposed to carbon tissue whose rate of 
permeation by an etching solution is variable with 
exposure. Subsequently, the carbon tissue is transferred 
onto a cylinder, and passed through developing 
and etching steps, to form on the cylinder cells having 
depths corresponding to the density tones of the 
continuous tone positive. The boundaries of the 
respective cells formed on the cylinder are in form of 
gravure screen walls for preventing ink leakage. This system includes a procedure for expressing 
density tones by varying the cell area while maintaining 
the cell depth constant (also called the direct 
gravure system), and a procedure for expressing density 
tones by varying both the cell depth and cell area 
(e.g. the two-positive system). In the former, a 
photosensitive solution is applied to a cylinder, and a 
halftone gravure positive is placed and exposed on the 
cylinder. After the developing and etching steps, the 
cylinder has formed thereon cells having areas corresponding 
to the halftone areas of the halftone gravure 
positive. In the latter, a continuous tone positive  
 
and a halftone gravure positive are successively placed 
and exposed on carbon tissue. After the transfer, 
developing and etching steps as in the conventional 
gravure system, the cylinder has formed thereon cells 
having depths corresponding to the density tones of the 
continuous-tone positive and areas corresponding to the 
halfton
