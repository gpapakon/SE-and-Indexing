<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle clutch assembly (1), particularly for tractors, is 
provided having a first clutch (8) interposed between the vehicle 

drive shaft (6) and transmission, and a second clutch (9) 
interposed between the drive shaft (6) and an output shaft (12) 

defining the power take-off of the vehicle. The assembly (1) 
further comprises an elastic device (75/ 88) for maintaining the 

second clutch (9) in the released position wherein the output 
shaft (12) is disconnected angularly from the drive shaft (6) and 

a manually operated activating device (51, 62, 81) for exerting 
a force in opposition to that of the elastic device (75/ 88), and 

setting the second clutch (9) to the engaged position wherein the 
two shafts (6, 12) are connected angularly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vehicle clutch
assembly, particularly for agricultural or industrial tractors.In a known manner, standard tractor clutch assemblies
normally comprise a first and a second disk clutch, the first
disk clutch being interposed between the tractor motor drive
shaft and the transmission, and the second disk clutch being
interposed between said motor drive shaft and an output shaft
defining the power take-off (PTO) for providing rotational
power to eventual implements carried or pulled by the tractor.In most cases, the two clutches are arranged side by side,
and are normally maintained in the closed or engaged position
by a common elastic element interposed between the end disks of
the two clutches. The first clutch is normally opened or
released using the clutch pedal, while the second clutch, which
is used less frequently than the first, is normally opened or
released and maintained in the released position by means of a
hand-operated lever connected by a Bowden cable to a lever
device controlling the second clutch and presenting a number of
rigid connecting members for exerting a force in a direction
opposite to that exerted by the elastic element.Though widely used, known clutch assemblies of the above
type may be the cause of injury to the tractor operator or any
bystanders in the vicinity of the tractor when the second
clutch is maintained in the released position by the lever. In
this condition, in fact, in the event of accidental breakage of
any of said connecting members or the Bowden cable, the second
clutch is immediately brought in the engaged position under
influence of the elastic element between the two clutches, thus
inadvertently and unintentionally activating the power take-off
and the eventual implement connected to it.To overcome this hazard, DE-A-2.244.889 proposes to
reverse the operating principle of the PTO clutch by providing
an elastic element which urges the clutch to a disengaged 
position while a lever device is operable to move the clutch in
a direction opposite to the action of the elastic element to
engage the clutch. Consequently, upon failure of the lever
device, the clutch is always returned to a safe, disengaged
position. However, the arrangement of DE-A-2.244.889 suffers
from the disadvantage that only at the initial movement of the
clutch disks towards an engaged position, the elastic means is
still operable to exert an increasing biasing force in a
direction opposite to the action of the lever device. Once the
disks have touched each
