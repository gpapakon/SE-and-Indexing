<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of preparing a diagnostic agent for detecting and locating inflammations in a warm-blooded living being by attaching a detectable label to an immunospecific protein or proteinaceous substance, wherein prior to the labelling procedure the protein or proteinaceous substance is purified by using a system comprising an anion exchange separating substance. The invention further relates to a kit comprising said purified protein or proteinaceous substance.

<DESCRIPTION>
Method of preparing a diagnostic aαent for detectinα inflammationsThe invention relates to a method of preparing a diagnostic agent for detecting and locating inflammations in a warm-blooded living being by attaching a detectable label to an immunospecific protein or proteinaceous substance. The invention further relates to a diagnostic agent obtained by using said method, to a pharmaceutical composition comprising said diagnostic agent, to the use of said composition and to a kit for preparing said pharmaceutical composition. Inflammations in the body of a warm-blooded living being cause many diseases and disorders, and may even turn out to be life-threatening. In order to be able to achieve a specific therapy, the detection and location of the inflammation site(s) in an early stage is of the utmost importance. A good diagnostic agent is also indispensable for supporting the therapy used. Various requirements have to be imposed on such a diagnostic agent, for example, non-toxic, no adverse influence on the host resistance and/or therapeutic treatment, well detectable and selective.The required high selectivity means that the diagnostic agent, after having been introduced into the body, must accumulate selectively at the site of the inflammation to be detected. In order to be detectable from outside the body, the diagnostic agent should be labelled, preferably with a radionuclide or with a paramagnetic metal isotope. In the former case, the radioactive radiation can be detected by using a suitable detector (scanning). Modern techniques in this field use emission tomography; when gamma radiating isotopes are used, the so-called single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) may be applied. The use of paramagnetic diagnostic agents enables a detection by means of imaging by magnetic resonance (magnetic resonance imaging).European Patent Application 241 106 describes the use of labelled immunoglobulins or fragments thereof for diagnosing inflammations. As is stated in said patent specification, immunoglobulins tend to accumulate more strongly in the inflamed sites than in the non-inflamed sites. As a result of this selectivity, i.e. a comparatively stronger concentration at the site of the inflammation, labelled immunoglobulins may be used for diagnostic imaging. From the examples of said patent specification a notable preference of radioactive-labelled immunoglobulins indeed appears for accumulation in inflamed sites over uptake in non-inflamed sites of the body.However, the selectivity, i.e. the
