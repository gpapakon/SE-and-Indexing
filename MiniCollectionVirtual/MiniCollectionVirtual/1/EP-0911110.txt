<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for monitoring the quality of a laser
process such as a welding process comprises monitoring the light

emitted from the weld plasma above the surface of the workpiece
being irradiated by the laser beam. The size of the plasma is

determined from the light emission and compared to a predetermined
value of the size as determined under process and workpiece

conditions that produce welds of acceptable quality. Variations
of the monitored plasma size greater than a preselected value can

represent unacceptable welds. Such variations can be caused by
changes in the laser beam power, the workpiece speed, laser

focusing problems, insufficient shield gas flow, workpiece
deformation and weld contamination. The process monitors the

light emission from a selected range of wavelengths that
correspond to the major emission peaks of the light spectrum. The

process enables in-process control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the field of materials
processing using lasers and, more particularly, to a method
for monitoring laser weld quality via plasma size
measurements.High power lasers are commonly used for materials working
processes such as laser welding, cutting, drilling and heat
treating. These processes provide a number of important
advantages over conventional welding processes including enhanced
speed, consistency and weld quality.During laser materials working processes, the laser beam
impinges on a workpiece, which becomes heated and eventually melts
and then vaporizes. This vapor and the surrounding gases are
ionized by the extreme heat and form a plasma plume between the
laser and the workpiece. Weld quality is affected by the
instability of the plasma formation and by instabilities in
process operating conditions such as fluctuations in the laser 
power and shield gas flow, and by workpiece defects such as weld
zone contamination and physical deformation.As the use of laser materials working processes increases in
industry, the need for accurate in-process techniques for
monitoring process quality increases as well. In-process
techniques provide important advantages as compared to post-process
non-destructive quality control techniques such as x-ray
and ultrasonic analysis, and visual inspection; and destructive
quality control techniques such as metallography. Such post-process
techniques tend to be labor intensive and tedious, and do
not enable real time monitoring and control of the laser
processing.U.S. Patent No. 5,360,960 discloses a laser process
monitoring system by counting the number of violations each time
the plasma light intensity violates one of the predetermined
plurality of light limits. Known in-process techniques for
monitoring laser materials working processes are not fully
satisfactory. Particularly, known techniques can falsely reject
good parts (type I error) or not reject bad parts (type II error).
Type I errors are detrimental in terms of economic cost. Type II
errors can be especially important, for example, in laser welded
parts that require high weld quality at certain critical welds.
The failure to detect bad welds can result in potentially
dangerous parts being placed into components. EP 0 691 174 A1 discloses a method of monitoring the condition
of a laser welding operation. To determine whether the laser
welding condition is satisfactory or not the plasma caused by
concentrically irradiating laser beams to an object is
photographed. Thereafter

A method of monitoring weld quality of a laser welding process in which a
laser beam (14) impinges onto a surface (56; 62) of a workpiece (50) and a

plasma is produced above the surface (56; 62) of the workpiece (50), the
method comprising the steps of:


a) providing a predetermined value of at least one physical dimension of
the plasma above the surface (56; 62) of the workpiece (50), the predetermined

value being determined under laser welding process conditions that
produce acceptable quality welds;
b) monitoring the spatial distribution (70) of the intensity of light emitted
from the plasma during the welding process, the light being monitored above

the surface of the workpiece as a function of time;
c) assigning a value of the physical dimension of the plasma based on the
intensity of light monitored as a function of time during the laser welding

process; and
d) comparing the value of the physical dimension of the plasma assigned
to the predetermined value, wherein the weld formed during the laser welding

process is evaluated as acceptable quality for values of the physical dimension
of the plasma assigned within a predetermined range of the predetermined

value of the physical dimension,
characterized in that
 the light emitted from the plasma during the welding
process is monitored along an optical axis substantially parallel to the surface

(56; 62) of the workpiece (50) and at a height less than 0,5 mm above the
surface of the workpiece.
The method of claim 1, wherein the predetermined value of the physical
dimension is a time-averaged value, and the step of assigning comprises assigning

the value of the physically dimension of the plasma from the intensity
of the light monitored over s
ubstantially only a steady state region of the
welding process. 
The method of claim 2, wherein the physical dimension is at least one of the
plasma width and the plasma height.
The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of correlating the time-averaged
value of the physical dimension of the plasma with (i) the speed of

movement of the laser beam (14) relative to the workpiece (50), and (ii) the
power of the laser beam (14).
The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of correlating the time-averaged
value of the physical dimension of the plasma with the depth of

penetration of the weld.
The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of correlating the time-averaged
value of the physical dimension of the plasma with at least one of (i)

the focusing of the laser beam (14) onto the workpiece (50), (ii) the flow of a
shield gas about the plasma; and (iii) physical deformation of the workpiece

(50).
The method of claim 1, wherein the preselected range is within from about +3
to about -3 standard deviations of the predetermined value of the physical

dimension.
