<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for full-automatically processing a 
photosensitive material is provided which requires less 

installation space, realizes a higher working efficiency 
based on a high-speed feeding of film and thereby assures 

less costly processing. The apparatus includes: a film-developing 
part (1) for developing individual films while 

feeding each of the films accompanying a leader; a 
printing part (2) for subjecting a photographic paper to an 

exposure; a paper-developing part (3) for developing the 
photographic paper exposed; and a film-sorting mechanism (27), 

disposed adjacent a terminating end of the film-developing 
part, for sorting the films by the kinds thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for processing a
photosensitive material and, more particularly, to an apparatus for
processing a photosensitive material capable of full-automatically
performing the film-developing processing through the photo-printing
processing.In a conventional apparatus for processing a photosensitive material,
a film-developing device and a photo-printing device are separately
provided, so that an enlarged space is required for the installation
of the apparatus. Further, the operation of transporting a film from
the film-developing device to the photo-printing device must be
performed by hand, thus resulting in a problem of infeasibility of
labor saving.Currently, an integral processing apparatus is practically available
which automatically performs the film-developing processing through
the photo-printing processing. Such integral processing apparatus,
however, is not adapted to allow a film to make the round of
processing tanks in the film-developing device with a short leader
leading the film. Further, the figure of the film being transported
is maintained only relying upon the stiffness of the film. These
account for problems of infeasibility of high-speed processing and
unsatisfactory working efficiency.Further, since there are four sizes of film (110, 126, 135 and 120),
the film-feeding guide in a developing tank must be replaced with an
alternative for each film size when films of four sizes are to be
subjected to the same processing. This leads to an increase in
troublesomeness and hence results in a problem of costly processing.The prior art of EP-A-0 136 979, which is the starting point of the
present invention, discloses an apparatus for processing a
photosensitive material comprizing a film-developing part for
developing individual films, a printing part for subjecting a
photographic paper to an exposure, and a paper-developing part. The disadvantage of this apparatus is that for different film formats
the negative masks have to be changed, thus resulting in a standstill
of the whole apparatus.Further the prior art of EP-A-0 437 814 shows the use of a leader
which is connected to a film. The leader has through openings permitting identification of
the size of film so that operation of a developing machine can be controlled according to the size of film.Finally the prior art of US-A-4,319,946 discloses an apparatus for
automatically classifying and reorganizing a processed long length of
film connected together with a series of separate rolls of exposed
film

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for processing a photosensitive material comprising:

a film-developing part (1) for developing individual films (10);
a printing part (2) for exposing a photographic paper (14) to an image of a developed film (10);
a paper-developing part (3) for developing the exposed photographic paper (14);
characterized by
means provided in the film-developing part (1) for feeding films (10) of different sizes, each of the films (10)
accompanying a leader (31, 32, 46, 51) during the developing of said

individual films (10), and
a film-sorting mechanism (27), disposed adjacent a terminating end of the
film-developing part (1), for sorting the films (10) according to the film size.
The apparatus of Claim 1, further comprising a film-standby
mechanism (26) for causing the films (10) to stand by for sorting

and a standby tank (24) for accommodating the films (10) standing
by, the film-standby mechanism (26) and the standby tank (24) being

disposed upstream of said film-sorting mechanism (27) of said film-developing
part (1), whereby the feeding of the films (10) can be

temporarily stopped so as to make the films (10) stand by when the
films (10) cannot be fed to said printing part (2).
The apparatus of Claim 1, wherein said film-developing part (1) and
said printing part (2) have a film inlet (5) and a film outlet (6),

respectively, on an operation table (4) of the apparatus. 
The apparatus of Claim 1, wherein said film-sorting mechanism (27)
comprises a sensor (47) for detecting the sizes of the films (10),

a cutter (48) for detaching each of the films (10) detected by the
sensor (47) from the leader (31, 32, 46, 51), and a sorting guide

(49) for guiding each film (10) detached from the leader (31, 32,
46, 51) by the cutter (48) toward said printing part (2).
The apparatus of Claim 2, wherein said film-standby mechanism (26)
comprises a guide roller (40) which is rotatable about an axis fixed at a location above

said standby tank (24), and a guide plate (41) disposed under the
guide roller (40) and movable toward and away from the guide roller

(40), whereby when the guide plate (41) is caused to move away from
the guide roller (40), the film (10) is allowed to sag down into

said standby tank (24) and to stand by therewithin.
