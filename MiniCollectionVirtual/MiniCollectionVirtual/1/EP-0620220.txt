<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel triazine derivatives 
and a herbicide containing the derivatives as an 
effective ingredient. A variety of herbicides have been hitherto developed 
and contributed to the productivity and labor-saving in 
agriculture. However, certain kinds of herbicides have been 
used over so long years that population of troublesome weeds 
withstanding them are increasing so that appearance is 
desired of a herbicids having a broad herbicidal spectrum and 
effectiveness also against these troublesome weeds. It is 
also desired to develop a high-activity herbicide in order 
to overcome the problem of environmental pollution by 
conventional herbicides. In order to overcome to the problem 
of the ununiform germination of weeds over a long period of 
time, furthermore, appearance is also awaited of a herbicide 
exhibiting excellent persistent effectiveness and having 
a versatility of treatment to exhibit effectiveness even 
by treatment over a wide range of period from the pre-germination 
stage to the growing period of weeds.  The inventors have continued investigations to develop 
a herbicide capable of exhibiting an excellent herbicidal 
effect against various kinds of annual and perennial weeds 
without causing phytotoxicity to paddy rice and arrived at 
a discovery that a herbicide containing a triazine compound 
as an effective ingredient is effective (official publication 
of Japanese Patent Toku-sai-hyo 88/02368, official 
publication of Japanese Patent Kokai 63-146876, official 
publication of Japanese Patent Kokai 63-51379 and official 
publication of Japanese Patent Kokai 63-264465). This 
triazine-based herbicide is highly active against troublesome 
weeds in paddy rice field at low dosage without phytotoxicity 
to paddy rice plant. This herbicide also show excellent 
herbicidal activity against troublesome weeds by foliage 
application in upland field without phytotoxicity to 
Gramineous crops. Nevertheless, this herbicide shows somewhat limited 
performance by preemergence treatment to the soil in upland 
fields. The present invention provides: 
(1) a triazine derivative represented by the general formula 
 
wherein Y¹ is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and Z is an oxygen 
atom or sulfur atom, X¹ is a halogen atom and R¹ is a hydrogen atom, 
a methyl group or an ethyl group.  (2) a herbicide containing, as an effective ingredient, a 
triazine derivative represented by the general formula 
 
wherein Y¹ is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and Z is an oxygen 
atom or
