<ABSTRACT>
In an internal combustion engine (10) with a crankshaft (12) vertical in a normal position, at least one overhead camshaft (16) and a transmission (60) between crankshaft (12) and camshaft (16) with plane of motion inside a transmission chamber perpendicular to the crankshaft axis (14), it is proposed to design the transmission chamber (70) as an oil reservoir in such a way that in the normal position and in some inclined positions of the engine a section of the transmission (60), at any one time situated at the lowest point, is immersed in the oil, in order thereby to achieve reliable engine lubrication.

<CLAIMS>
Internal combustion engine (10) with a crankshaft (12) which is 
vertical in the normal position of the engine, as least one overhead 

camshaft (16) and a transmission (60) between crankshaft (12) and the at 
least one camshaft (16) with plane of movement within a transmission 

cavity (70) perpendicular to the axis (14) of the crankshaft
characterised in that
 
the transmission cavity (70) is formed as an oil sump in such a way that in 

the normal position as well as in possible tilted positions of the engine the 
currently lowermost portion of the transmission (60) dips into the oil. 
Engine according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the transmission 60 is formed by an endless chain (62) which passes over 

a sprocket (64) connected to the camshaft (16) and a sprocket (66) 
connected to the crankshaft (12). 
Engine according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 
the transmission is formed by an endless belt, preferably a toothed belt, 

which passes over a pulley connected to the camshaft and a pulley 
connected to the crankshaft. 
Engine according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that
 
there is provided in the region of the crankshaft end and/or the camshaft 

end of the transmission (60) at least one impact surface for oil flung from 
the transmission (60) to generate oil sprays or an oil mist.  

 
Engine according to claim 4,
characterised in that
 
at least one oil channel is provided in the neighbourhood of the bearing of 

the crankshaft (12) and/or of the camshaft (16) for conducting precipitated 
oil mist of oil spray to the bearing in question. 
Engine according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised by
 
an oil pump (56) of which the inlet is connected to the oil sump and the 

outlet is connected to a big end bearing (72). 
Engine according to claim 6,
characterised in that
 
the outlet from the oil pump (56) is connected to a passage (80) in the 

crankshaft (12) having its outlet opening (80b) at the big end bearing (72). 
Engine according to claim 6 or 7,
characterised in that
 
the oil pump (56) is a rubber vane pump driven from the crankshaft (12). 
Engine according to one of the foregoing claim,
characterised in that
 
part of the oil sump is an annular space (54) around the crankshaft (12). 
Engine according to one of claims 6 to 9,
characterised in that
 
the inlet to the oil pump (56) is connected to the annular space (54) 

through a feed pipe (56a) which opens into the annular space (54) in the 
region of the bottom of the space.  

 
Engine according to claim 10,
characterised in that
 
the feed pipe (56a) opens into the annular space (54) on that side of the 

axis (14) of the crankshaft which lies diametrically opposite the camshaft 
(16). 
Engine according to one of claims 9 to 11,
characterised in that
 
the annular space (54) is provided with a cover (84) arranged underneath 

the transmission (60). 
Engine according to claim 12,
characterised in that
 
the cover (84) is provided with at least one opening (86) for oil . 
Engine according to claim 13,
characterised in that
 
the at least one opening (86) for oil is provided with an upwardly 

projecting peripheral collar (88). 
Engine according to claim 13 or 14,
characterised in that
 
the cover has a central opening (84a) through which the crankshaft (12) 

passes. 
Engine according to one of claims 13 to 15,
characterised by
 
at least one opening (86) for oil on the side of the axis (14) of the 

crankshaft which is towards the at least one camshaft (16).  
 
Engine according to one of claims 12 to 16,
characterised in that
 
the cover (84) is formed by a sheet metal pressing. 
Engine according to one of the foregoing claims,
characterised in that
 
part of the oil sump is a recess (76) underneath the camshaft (16). 
The use of an engine according to one of the foregoing claims in a 
lawnmower.
