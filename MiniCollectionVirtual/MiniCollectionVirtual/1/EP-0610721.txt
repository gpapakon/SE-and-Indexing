<ABSTRACT>
A transfer sheet for printing a substrate comprises a base film (1), a detachable release layer (2) arranged thereunder, a varnish layer (3) of a transluscent structure, a preferably vapour-deposited metal layer (4) arranged thereunder and also an external layer facing away from the base film (1). The external layer serves for bonding the decorative layer (3, 4), composed of the varnish layer (3) and the metal layer (4), to the substrate to be printed. To provide a sheet for printing a substrate which is easier to process than known embossing foils, it is proposed to form the external layer as a sealant (5) which does not have any adhesiveness of its own. Only in combination with an adhesive, which itself is not a component part of the transfer sheet, does the sealant (5) cause the transfer sheet to be bonded to the substrate to be printed.

Transfer sheet for printing a substrate, comprising 
a carrier film (1), a detachable release layer (2) 

arranged under the latter, a lacquer layer (3) which is 
designed to be translucent, a metal layer (4) which is 

arranged under the latter and is preferably vapour-deposited, 
and a layer which is located on the outside, 

faces away from the carrier film and serves to connect 
the decorative layer (3, 4), composed of the lacquer 

layer (3) and the metal layer (4), to the substrate to be 
printed, characterized in that the layer located on the 

outside is designed as a sealing means (5) based on 
resin, in that the sealing means (5) contains an adhesion 

promoter, and in that the sealing means (5) has no 
intrinsic adhesion capability, irrespective of the 

processing temperature, and is only able to produce the 
connection to the substrate to be printed if it is 

combined with an adhesive which is not itself a 
constituent of the transfer film. 
Transfer sheet as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by a sealing means (5) which under pressure loading, 

for example in a press-roll unit, enters into the connection 
with the external adhesive, even at room temperature. 
Transfer sheet according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that the sealing means (5) is designed 

to be optically opaque. 
Transfer sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the sealing means (5) and the 

lacquer layer (3), apart from the different covering 
properties and the addition of adhesion promoter in the  

 
sealing means (5), are composed of the same material. 
Transfer sheet according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized by a layer of nitrocellulose on an acrylic 

resin base as the sealing means (5).
