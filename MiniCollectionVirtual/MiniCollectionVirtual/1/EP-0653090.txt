<ABSTRACT>
A portable computer (11) is configured to accept removable modular display panels of different types that plug into a structure hinged to the body of the computer (11). Each display panel (13) has a sliding engagement means (25-30) fixed along a lower edge, and the hinged structure (17) has a mating sliding engagement means (39', 39", 32 and 33) along an upper edge and parallel to the axis of the hinge, allowing a display panel to engage and disengage in the direction of the axis of the hinge. In another aspect of the invention, in the motion of engaging a display, a two-part, multi-pin electrical connector (39) is also engaged, for conveying control signals to the display. In an embodiment of the invention, display modules adaptable to the computer have a code stored in a memory device (51) that is accessible on start-up by the computer, to identify and load a display driver routine capable of driving the display module assembled to the computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of architecture of
portable computers, and pertains in particular to apparatus
and methods of interfacing removable physical displays to
portable computers.The marketplace for portable computers, such as
notebook and laptop computers, is one of the faster growing
sectors of the computer industry. There are many challenges
in developing and designing computers of this sort, many of
which are a result of need for light weight, strength, and
longevity of portable power sources.Another area of innovation in the development of
portable computers is driven by the facts of use of
portable computers as compared to stationary models.
Portable computers have to operate under a variety of
conditions. For example, while a stationary model, such as
a desktop computer, is typically used at a single location
under relatively constant lighting conditions, a portable
computer must be usable under a variety of lighting
conditions in both indoor and outdoor situations. In some
situations it is even preferable to have a display that is
usable in bright sunlight.A portable computer is known from US-A-5103377,
comprising a body structure for housing and supporting
computer elements, a display means and a mounting structure
for pivotally attaching the display means to the body
structure. A leg portion of the mounting structure is
received by an opening in the body structure, the opening
having a cover provided with a cable through hole. The body
structure and display means being connected by means of a
cable.In US-A-4794381, an electronic apparatus is disclosed
comprising a computer main body including a display portion
and keyboard portion, and an external output unit 
comprising a printer integrally coupled with said computer
main body.There are several different types of computer
displays, and many new types being developed, all of which
are what are called in the art "flat panel" displays. Flat
panel displays are necessary, because the well-known CRT
displays are much too bulky and vulnerable to be used
extensively for portable applications.Among the many different types are Transflective
displays, which have low back light and low power
consumption; standard monochrome paper-white displays,
which are back-lit and exhibit moderate power consumption;
and passive colour displays, also known as super-twist
nematic (STN), which have very good visibility and colour,
but exhibit higher power consumption.There are seen to be, then, many issues one must
consider when choosing a display, such as

<CLAIMS>
A flat-panel display module (13) for a computer
comprising:


a display screen presented on one surface for
displaying computer output; and
mating electrical connection means (39') for providing
display control signals to said display module (13),

characterised by
slidable engagement means (25,27,29) mounted along a
first edge of said display module for joining said display

module to a computer;
said slidable engagement means being configured to
engage a corresponding slidable engagement means (26,28,30)

mounted to a mounting structure (17) pivotally attached
along a pivot axis to a body surface (19) of a computer,

an engagement direction being parallel to said pivot axis.
A flat-panel module as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said slidable engagement means (25, 27, 29) comprises at

least one engagement rail configured to engage a
corresponding rail mounted to said mounting structure (17).
A flat-panel display module as claimed in claim 2,
wherein said slidable engagement means (25,27,29) comprises

at least two of a shaft and matching bore being a part of
said display module, configured to engage at least two of

a bore and matching shaft being a part of said mounting
structure, the engagement direction being the direction of

said pivot axis, and engagement being accomplished by
moving said display module (13) in the direction of said

pivot axis. 
A general-purpose computer comprising a body structure
(19) for housing and supporting computing elements; a flat-panel

display means (13) and a mounting structure (17) for
pivotally attaching the display means to the body

structure, characterised in that:

said display means comprises a flat-panel display
module (13) as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3.
A general-purpose computer as in claim 4, wherein said
mating electrical connection means (39) comprises a first

portion (39') of a multi-pin electrical connector mounted
in said display module (13), and a second portion (39'') of

said multi-pin electrical connector mounted in a portion of
said mounting structure (17), said first and second

portions (39', 39") of said multi-pin electrical connector
engageable by the motion that engages said first and second

slidable engagement means (26 to 30).
A general-purpose computer as claimed in claims 4 or
5, further comprising a snap-in structure (32) extending

from one of said display module (13) and said mounting
structure means (13) and an engagement slot (33) in the

other of said display module and said mounting structure
means, configured to engage and snap together as said

display module and mounting structure means fully engage,
thereby holding said display module firmly in engagement

with said mounting structure means.
A general-purpose computer as in claim 6 wherein said
snap-in structure (32) comprises release means (37) for

unlocking to release said display module from said mounting
structure means for removal.
