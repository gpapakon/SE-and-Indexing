<ABSTRACT>
A controller of an automatic transmission which allows 
to improve a durability of frictional engage elements and to 

shorten a gear change time even when a jumped gear change is 
made is provided. The controller of the automatic 

transmission of the present invention comprises a first 
hydraulic servo to which oil is supplied to make a jumped 

gear change, a second hydraulic servo to which oil is 
supplied to make a gear change to an intermediate gear 

change step, a limited oil supplying circuit created going 
through oil amount limiting means, a quick oil supplying 

circuit created without going through the oil amount 
limiting means and pressure governing means for governing a 

line pressure under a controlled pressure to supply oil 
under the controlled pressure to the quick oil supplying 

circuit. Oil path switching means switches the limited oil 
supplying circuit and the quick oil supplying circuit to 

supply oil to the first hydraulic servo or the second 
hydraulic servo. Accordingly, when the jumped gear change 

is made, oil is supplied to the first hydraulic servo via 
the quick oil supplying circuit and the operating pressure 

can be increased quickly, so that the gear change time may 
be shortened.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a controller of an 
automatic transmission. Conventionally, P (parking ) range, R (reverse) range, 
N (neutral) range, D (drive) range, 2 (second) range and L 
(low) range are provided for an automatic transmission and 
a gear change step (gear ratio) is automatically selected and a gear 
change is made corresponding to a traveling condition of a 
vehicle as a driver selects a range by moving a shift lever 
to its range position in an I shaped pattern. Beside that, one has been provided which is provided 
with an H pattern shift positions arranged in H shape 
similarly to a manual shift, in addition to the I pattern 
range positions, to allow to move a shift lever to a range 
position to select to travel in an automatic gear change 
mode and to move the shift lever to a shift position to 
select to travel in a manual gear change mode (See 
DE-A-4 042 045, which shows the features of the precharacterizing portion of Claim 1.). It allows a driver to 
freely select the gear change steps (gear ratios) and to obtain a 
sufficient shift feeling. By the way, in the automatic transmission having only  
 
the I pattern range positions, a jumped gear change (e.g. 
1-3 gear change, 1-4 gear change, etc.) is sometimes made 
depending on a traveling condition of the vehicle. Further, 
in the automatic transmission having the I pattern range 
positions and H pattern shift positions, a jumped gear 
change is sometimes made by manipulating the shift lever for 
example while driving the vehicle in the manual gear change 
mode. In such cases, although it is ideal to make the gear 
change directly to a targeted gear change step (hereinafter 
referred to as "the targeted gear change step"), a thermal 
load of the frictional engage elements engaged during the 
gear change becomes great when the gear change is made 
directly to the targeted gear change step and hence the 
durability of the frictional engage elements is lowered. While it is conceivable to increase a number of 
friction members of the frictional engage elements or to 
increase their frictional area, it increases not only the 
size and weight of the automatic transmission, but also a 
dragging loss due to the friction members. Then, the 
thermal load of the frictional engage elements is reduced by 
making a gear change once to a gear change step between the 
current gear change step and the targeted gear change step 
(hereinafter referred to as "the intermediate gear change 
step") when a jumped gear change is to be made.
