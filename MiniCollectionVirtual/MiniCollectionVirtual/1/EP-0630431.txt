Gill-box frame for slivers by which the fallers are radially movable, 
guided in bearing-mounted slotted disks which rotate on an axis and 

the distance between the axis and fallers can be reduced or extended 
by means of stationary cams on both sides, characterized so that the 

slots (6) of the slotted disks (5) exhibit a sloped plane (SE) in the form 
of a contact area directed inward and upon which faller ends glide, and 

that the respective opposed slots (6) of the slotted disks (5) have the 
same direction of inclination. 
Gill-box frame in accordance with 1, characterized so that the direction 
of inclination of the sloped plane (SE) is different in sequential slots (6) 

or slot groups. 
Gill-box frame in accordance with 1, characterized so that the direction 
of inclination of the sloped plane (SE) is the same in all the slots (6) of a 

slotted disk (5).
