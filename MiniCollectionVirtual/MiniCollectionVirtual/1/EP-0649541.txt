<ABSTRACT>
A method and a case (2) for disinfection of contact lenses is described, where the contact lenses are placed in a double chamber (4) filled with cleaning fluid, for instance hydrogen peroxide, the case (2) comprises a third chamber (6) or position connected with the double chamber (4), and which is adapted to take up or hold a tablet (7) containing a neutralization agent (catalase), so that the hydrogen peroxide in the double chamber (4) is neutralized suitably slowly by the admission to dissolve the tablet (7). By the dissolution of the catalase tablet (7) oxygen is generated, and an oxygen bubble is formed around the tablet, so that the hydrogen peroxide alternately is kept away from the tablet (7) and alternately gets admission to the tablet (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for disinfection
of contact lenses of the type described in the introductory
part of claim 1.Users of contact lenses, particularly soft contact
lenses, are familar with the fact that contact lenses frequently,
preferably daily, have to be cleaned to avoid inconveniences
by the use of contact lenses.Normally hydrogen peroxide is used for disinfection
of the contact lenses, which for this purpose is placed
in special cases, which may be used for the keeping of
the contact lenses as well as for disinfection of these.
The contact lenses are kept in the cleaning fluid (hydrogen
peroxide) until next use, for instance through the
night.In order to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide before
next use of the contact lenses, it is known to neutralize
the hydrogen peroxide - by using of a "platinum star",
which acts as a catalyst, or by using an enzyme tablet
- containing for instance catalase - to neutralize the hydrogen
peroxide.US-A-4 011 941 discloses an apparatus comprising
a cleaning capsule for the sterilizing of soft contact lenses
in an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and a
method where the neutralizing agent is brought into contact
with the cleaning solution by inverting the cleaning
capsule - and where use is made of a catalytic reactor
coated with a layer of platimum.To ensure that there will be time enough for the hydrogen
peroxide to disinfect the contact lenses for micro
organism and virus before the neutralization, it is furthermore
known to delay the effect of the catalase by
using a special tablet, where the catalase is coated with
methyl-cellulose or a PVP-film. EP-A-0 209 071 discloses
the use of such an encapsulated neutralizing tablet
which is inserted into the cleaning solution and releases
the neutralizing agent with delay. ES-A-2 022 020
discloses a method for disinfection of contact lenses
making use of a closed, perforated comportment for
the neutralizing agent. The comportment constitutes
a physical impediment for the entramer of the cleaning fluid.Catalase is an enzyme, which is capable to convert
the hydrogen peroxide into water and free oxygen. In
practise the used tablet contains a salt with catalase, so
that the hydrogen peroxide is converted into physilogical
salt water.The purpose of the invention is to provide a method
enabling a further improvement by disinfection of the
contact lenses cf. the method as mentioned introductorily.The method according to the invention is defined in
claim 1 and is distinctive in that disinfection of the

<CLAIMS>
A method for disinfection of contact lenses comprising the steps of placing the contact lenses (10) in a cleaning fluid in the form of hydrogen peroxide in a container, and carrying out neutralization of the cleaning fluid by means of a tablet (7) containing a neutralization agent catalase, 
characterized
 by
 the step of placing said tablet containing the enzyme catalase, in a separate chamber (6) within said container, said chamber having an opening (8) for free access of fluid being placed in a level just under the tablet, such that the admission
for the cleaning fluid to this chamber

is controlled by the generation of oxygen by
the reaction between the cleaning fluid and the enzyme

catalase, whereby disinfection of the contact
lenses (10) and neutralization of the cleaning fluid,

respectively, are controlled by means of said tablet
(7).
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
 use is made of a tablet containing the enzyme catalase without being encapsulated or coated.
A container for use in the method according to claim 1, said container comprising a chamber (4) with a
room (A) for a right contact lens (10) and a room (B)

for a left contact lens, and a chamber (6)
which is adapted to receive said enzyme

catalase tablet, said chamber having an opening (8) for free access of fluid being placed in a level just under the tablet, said chamber (4) for the contact
lenses (10) being connected to said chamber (6)

for the catalase tablet (7) in
such a manner that the admission of the cleaning

fluid to the neutralization agent is controlled by the
generation of oxygen by the reaction between the

cleaning fluid and the enzyme catalase tablet.
