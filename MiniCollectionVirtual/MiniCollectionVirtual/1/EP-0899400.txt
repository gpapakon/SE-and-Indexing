<ABSTRACT>
A engine cover or hood (1) catch comprises a catch (13) under the front of the engine cover or hood. There is a grip (12) on the vehicle to hold the catch when the engine cover or hood is closed. The grip is released by a remote control and holds the engine cover or hood with an adjustable force which increases with increasing road speed. The road speed is monitored by a sensor activated by the ram effect or by some other system including a variable suction force via the engine inlet manifold, or by a electronic sensors on the engine timing. A safety interlock releases the catch when the airbag protection system is activated.
