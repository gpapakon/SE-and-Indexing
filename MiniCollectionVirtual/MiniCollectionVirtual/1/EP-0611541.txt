A lid (1) for a receptacle for cooking under pressure, said 
receptacle comprising a body (2) in which said lid (1) is intended to 

be mounted and locked in sealed manner by means of locking jaws (3), 
said lid (1) being characterized in that it includes in its central 

portion a depression zone (13) defining a concave face forming a 
portion of the outside face of the lid (1), and an annular zone (20) 

having the same axis of symmetry as that of the lid (1) and 
presenting a curved cross section that is concave in the opposite 

direction to the depression zone (13), the depression zone presenting 
at its central point a depth of not less than 1 mm and not exceeding 

50% of the total height of the lid. 
A lid according to claim 1, characterized in that the depression 
zone (13) represents between 40% and 60%, and preferably 50%, of the 

surface area of the outside face of said lid (1). 
A lid according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the annular 
zone (20) extends substantially to the periphery of the lid. 
A lid according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
it is delimited at its periphery by a peripheral skirt (11). 
A lid according to claim 4, characterized in that the peripheral 
skirt (11) constitutes a cylindrical section centered on the axis of 

symmetry (x-x') of the lid (1). 
A lid according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the 
junction between the peripheral skirt (11) and the annular zone (20) 

is constituted by a peripheral rolled edge (21) connected to said 
annular zone by a corrugation (22) forming a peripheral groove. 
A lid according to claim 6, characterized in that the curvatures 
of the peripheral rolled edge (21) and the corrugation (22) are 

inverted and substantially equal.  
 
A lid according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the junction between the peripheral skirt (11) and the annular zone 

(20) is formed by a peripheral border that is plane or slightly 
inclined. 
A receptacle for cooking under pressure, in particular a pressure 
cooker, fitted with a lid according to any one of claims 1 to 8.
