<ABSTRACT>
An energy window of a scintillation camera system is set to include only events which have been Compton-scattered within a slice of the body of a patient undergoing a SPECT examination. From events so acquired, a scatter image is reconstructed. The scatter image is processed to define therewithin a plurality of regions of constant attenuation coefficient. This information can be used during the normal image reconstruction process to eliminate artifacts caused by variation in attenuation coefficient.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to nuclear medicine, and more 
particularly relates to SPECT studies which are carried out 
to form tomographic images of the uptake of radioisotopes 
within body organs. In its most immediate sense, the 
invention relates to attenuation correction of data used in 
SPECT studies of, e.g., the heart. In a conventional SPECT (Single Photon Emission 
Computed Tomography) study of an organ such as the heart, a 
radioisotope (Tc-99m, Tl-201, for example) is administered 
to the patient and the radioisotope is taken up by the heart 
muscles. Then, the patient is placed in a scintillation 
camera system and one or more scintillation camera detectors 
are rotated about the long axis of the patient. These 
detectors pick up gamma radiation which leaves the patient, 
and the resulting data is used to form three-dimensional 
images ("SPECT images" or "tomographic images") of the 
distribution of the radioisotope within the patient. Such three dimensional SPECT images can be 
calculated based on a set of two-dimensional images 
("projections" or "projection images") acquired by the 
scintillation camera system; this calculation process is 
known as image reconstruction. The most commonly employed 
method of image reconstruction is known as "filtered 
backprojection". When filtered backprojection 
reconstruction is used to reconstruct SPECT images from 
scintigraphic projection images obtained from a 
scintillation camera, some well-known distortions introduce 
errors ("artifacts") in the result. One of the most 
important distortions is caused by attenuation of gamma 
radiation in tissue.  
 As a consequence of attenuation, image values in the 
various projections do not represent line integrals of the 
radioisotope distribution within the body. It is therefore 
necessary to correct for this, and the process for doing so 
in SPECT is known as attenuation correction. Many techniques for attenuation correction in SPECT 
assume that the linear attenuation coefficient of the body 
is uniform and impose such uniformity as a mathematical 
constraint in the image reconstruction process. However, 
for a very important class of studies, namely cardiac SPECT 
studies, the linear attenuation coefficient of the body is 
in fact highly nonuniform. This is because lung tissue has 
a lower attenuation than do, e.g., the blood and other non-lung 
tissue. Thus, in SPECT studies of, e.g., the heart, a SPECT 
reconstruction of the image of radioactivity within the 
heart will necessarily contain artifacts caused

<CLAIMS>
A method for using a scintillation camera system to 
map a slice of a patient's body into a plurality of 

regions in such a manner that each region may accurately 
be treated as having a single linear attenuation 

coefficient, comprising the following steps: 

conducting a SPECT study of the patient using a 
scintillation camera system which is set to acquire, from 

scintillation events caused by gamma radiation 
originating within said slice, those events having 

energies within an energy window which includes a range 
of energies associated only with Compton-scattered gamma 

radiation; 
reconstructing, from events acquired during said 
SPECT study, a scatter image; and 
processing said scatter image in such a manner as to 
define therewithin a plurality of bounded regions, each 

bounded region having a constant linear attenuation 
coefficient. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps 
of directing gamma rays through said slice, measuring the 

transmittances of said directed gamma rays, and 
calculating, from said measured transmittances, the 

attenuation coefficients of said bounded regions. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said scintillation 
camera system is also set to acquire, from scintillation 

events caused by gamma radiation originating within said 
slice, those events having energies within a second 

energy window which includes a range of energies 
associated with a photopeak of a radioisotope used in 

said SPECT study, and further comprising the step of 
additionally reconstructing, from events acquired during 

said SPECT study which fall within said second energy 
window, an image of said slice.

transmittances of said directed gamma rays, and 

calculating, from said measured transmittances, the

wherein said additional reconstructing step is carried 
out using said calculated attenuation coefficients. 
The method of claim 3, further comprising the steps 
of identifying said bounded regions by composition, 

assigning known attenuation coefficients to said bounded 
regions, and carrying out said additional reconstruction 

step using said known attenuation coefficients.
