<ABSTRACT>
A pressure suppression containment system 14 includes a containment vessel 24 
surrounding a reactor pressure vessel 16 and defining a drywell 26 therein containing a non-condensable 

gas. An enclosed wetwell pool 28 is disposed inside the containment vessel 
24, and a gravity driven cooling system (GDCS) pool 44 is disposed above the wetwell pool 

28 in the containment vessel 24. The wetwell pool 28 includes a plenum 32 for receiving 
the non-condensable gas carried with steam from the drywell 26 following a loss-of-coolant-accident 

(LOCA). The wetwell plenum 32 is vented to a plenum 47 above the GDCS pool 
44 following the LOCA for suppressing pressure rise within the containment vessel 24. A 

method of operation includes channeling steam released into the drywell 26 following the 
LOCA into the wetwell pool 28 for cooling along with the non-condensable gas carried 

therewith. The GDCS pool 44 is then drained by gravity, and the wetwell plenum 32 is 
vented into the GDCS plenum 47 for channeling the non-condensable gas thereto.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to nuclear reactors, and, more specifically, 
to pressure containment therein. A nuclear reactor plant includes a containment vessel surrounding a reactor pressure 
vessel and defining therewith a drywell which typically contains a non-condensable gas 
such as nitrogen. Disposed in the pressure vessel is a conventional nuclear reactor core 
submerged in water which is effective for heating the water to generate steam which is 
discharged from the pressure vessel for use in powering a steam turbine-generator for 
producing electrical power, for example. Typically surrounding the pressure vessel within the containment vessel is an 
annular suppression pool or wetwell which serves various functions including being a heat 
sink during postulated accidents. For example, one type of accident designed for is a loss-of-coolant 
accident (LOCA) in which steam from the pressure vessel leaks therefrom into 
the drywell. Following the LOCA, therefore, the reactor is shut down but pressurized steam 
and residual decay heat continue to be generated for a certain time following the shutdown. 
In one conventional safety system, the pressure vessel is depressurized by discharging the 
steam into the wetwell for cooling and condensing and for preventing unacceptably large 
pressure increases within the containment vessel itself. And, steam escaping into the 
drywell is also channeled into the wetwell through conventional horizontal vents disposed 
therein. Improved nuclear reactor plants are being developed to reduce or eliminate the need 
for AC powered safety systems following a LOCA, for example. In one design designated 
a Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR), a Passive Containment Cooling System (PCCS) 
is provided for removing heat from the containment vessel during the LOCA. One example  
 
of a PCCS is disclosed in EP-A-0,460,805 wherein the wetwell, or 
suppression pool, is enclosed and separated from the 
drywell within the containment vessel, and a Gravity Driven Cooling System (GDCS) pool 
is located above the wetwell within the containment vessel and is vented to the drywell. 
An isolation pool is disposed outside the containment vessel and above the GDCS pool and 
contains a heat exchanger (Passive Containment Cooling condenser, or PCC condenser) 
having an inlet disposed in flow communication with the drywell, and an outlet joined to a 
collector chamber from which a vent pipe extends into the wetwell and a condensate return 
conduit extends into the GDCS pool.
