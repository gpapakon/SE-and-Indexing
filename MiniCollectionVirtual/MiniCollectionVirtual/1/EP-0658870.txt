<ABSTRACT>
A display apparatus is constituted by a 
display device comprising a pair of oppositely 

disposed substrates having thereon scanning electrodes 
and data electrodes, respectively, and an optical 

modulation substance disposed between the substrates 
so as to form a number of pixels each at an 

intersection of the scanning electrodes and the data 
electrodes; and drive means capable of setting one 

frame period to be divided into different periods of 
sub-frames. The drive means further includes means 

for setting a whole picture scanning period for 
scanning all the scanning electrodes and a partial 

rewrite period for scanning only scanning electrodes 
for effecting a required display change so as to allow 

a partial rewrite in a shorter cycle than a frame 
cycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a display
apparatus for use in a terminal monitor for a
computer, a view finder for a video camera, a light
valve for a projector, a television receiver, a car
navigation system, etc., particularly a display
apparatus capable of gradational display by
controlling the time duration of each pixel assuming a
bright or a dark state.Hitherto, as a method of apparently effecting
a gradational display in a display apparatus
inherently having no capability of gradational
display, there has been known a method of modulating
(changing) the ratio of time durations for displaying
two states, e.g., a white display and a dark display.
This is generally called a time modulation, frame
modulation or frame thinning-out scheme and is
disclosed in, e.g., Japanese Laid-Open Patent
Application (JP-A) 61-69036. According to this
scheme, however, an additional time is required
corresponding to an increase in number of gradation
levels, and a time required for a display of 8
gradations or gradation levels at a pixel amounts to a
time corresponding to 7 frames according to the
conventional binary display scheme. In contrast thereto, JP-A 62-56936 has
proposed a gradational display scheme including sub-frames
(modulation time units) for which reset pulses
are applied at different timing (i.e., at different
time instants), whereby 8 gradation levels are
displayed in a time corresponding to 3 frames of the
conventional binary display scheme (see Figure 1B).However, the above-mentioned scheme of
displaying 8 gradation levels in a time of 3 frames
requires a long reset period so that the average
luminance at the brightest level is decreased by 40 %
from that in the binary display.Examples of such a time modulation scheme (or
frame thinning-out scheme or frame modulation scheme)
are also disclosed in JP-A 64-61180, JP-A 5-127623 and
EP-A 319291.Anyway, in the above-mentioned time
modulation scheme, one frame is constituted by
scanning each scanning electrode the same number of
times, so that it requires a long time for display and
the frame frequency is lowered to cause flicker. If
the number of scanning electrodes is decreased so as
to prevent the occurrence of flicker, the resolution
of a picture is lowered.Further, as all the scanning electrodes are
scanned the same number of times to constitute one
frame, it is impossible to change the rewriting 
periodic time in case of changing the display, so that
the display change cannot be effected quickly. More
specifically, in operation of OA appliances,

<CLAIMS>
A display apparatus comprising:

a display panel (1) including a pair of oppositely
disposed substrates (2,3) having thereon a plurality of

scanning electrodes (5) and a plurality of data
electrodes (6), and an optical modulation medium (12)

between the substrates, a pixel (7) being defined at each
intersection of the scanning electrodes and the data

electrodes; and
drive means (402-407) for driving the display panel
so that a period of each pixel being placed in a

prescribed display state is determined within a frame
period depending on given gradation data;

characterised in that:
said drive means (402-407) operates to divide each
frame period into a first plurality of equal duration

time blocks of which a second plurality, smaller in
number than said first plurality, and mutually non-neighbouring,

are allotted to a partial rewriting for
selecting scanning electrodes corresponding to pixels of

which the display states are to be changed, and the
remaining blocks, other than said second plurality of

blocks amongst said first plurality of blocks, are
allotted to an entire picture scanning for selecting all

the scanning electrodes;
said drive means is adapted to select scanning lines
in a manner such that for each entire picture scanning 

each scanning line is selected a plurality n times at
respective n different time interval spacings (G,H;K,L);

and
said drive means is adapted to select scanning lines
in a manner such that for each partial rewriting the

scanning lines selected therefor are selected each a
multiple of said plurality n times at respective n

different time interval spacings (I,J) whereby the ratio
(G:H; K:L) of said different time interval spacings (G,H;

K,L) for entire picture scanning is substantially the
same as the ratio (I:J) of said different time interval

spacings for partial rewriting thus providing an
allocation of identical numbers 2
n
 of gradation levels
having substantially identical respective weightings for

entire picture scanning and for partial rewriting,
respectively.
Apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said drive

means is adapted to select each scanning line twice for
each entire picture scanning, the plurality n being two

and the corresponding number 2
n
 of gradation levels being
four.
Apparatus according to claim 2 wherein the ratio
(G:H) of different time interval spacings (G,H) for

entire picture scanning and the ratio (I:J) of different
time interval spacings (I,J) for partial rewriting have 

substantially a same ratio of 1:2.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein
said drive means is adapted to select scanning lines for

each entire picture scanning in an interlaced manner.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim wherein
said optical modulation medium is a ferroelectric chiral

smectic liquid crystal.
