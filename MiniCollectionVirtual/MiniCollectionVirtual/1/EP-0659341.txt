<ABSTRACT>
A solid formulation which comprises polyvinylpyrrolidone 
and a pyrethroid insecticide, for example alpha-cypermethrin, 

is disclosed for use in the treatment of animals, for example 

cattle. Also disclosed are uses of the solid formulation and 
methods which use the solid formulation in the treatment of 

animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid insecticidal
formulation and, more particularly, relates to the use of
such a formulation in the treatment of animals.GB-A-2139893 discloses a composition comprising a
pesticide such as a synthetic pyrethroid, an emulsifier or
dispersing agent for the pesticide and a self-disintegrating
agent capable of effervescing or swelling on
being contacted with water such as a cross-linked
polyvinylpyrrolidone. The composition is prepared either
by dissolving the pesticide in a solvent and adding thereto
the emulsifier or dispersing agent or by absorbing onto an
absorptive carrier a water or oil based suspension
concentrate of the pesticide and the emulsifier or
dispersing agent when it is in liquid form, separately
preparing a dry powdered mixture of the remaining
constituents and then mixing the pesticide solution or
pesticide-containing absorptive carrier with the dry
powdered mixture of the remaining constituents. The
composition may be in the form of an effervescent
pesticidal tablet which may be added to water and the
resultant aqueous solution used for pest control.EP-A-0415688 discloses a solid dosage form which
contains, inter alia, an active ingredient such as a
pesticide and a disintegrating agent such as a cross-linked
polyvinylpyrrolidone. The solid dosage form is prepared by
admixing an active ingredient which is in solid form at
25Â°C and which has an average particle size of less than 5
microns with a disintegrating agent to provide a
compressible mix and compressing the mix into a unitary
solid dosage form. The solid dosage form thus produced may
be introduced into a predetermined volume of water and the
resulting suspension used for pest control. Animals, for example cattle, need to be periodically
externally treated with an insecticide in order to combat
ectoparasitic pests. One widely used method of contacting
animals with an insecticide involves dispersing the
insecticide in water in a large tank and then immersing
the animals in the liquid in the tank.Concentrated liquid insecticidal formulations are
often used for delivering an insecticide to the water in
the tank. However, liquid formulations in the form of
emulsifiable concentrates contain a very high proportion
of organic solvent (often up to 80 percent) which are
increasingly coming under scrutiny for their effect on the
environment; emulsion concentrates have a higher water
content but still contain organic solvents. Suspension
concentrates, another water-based liquid form, are often
viscous
