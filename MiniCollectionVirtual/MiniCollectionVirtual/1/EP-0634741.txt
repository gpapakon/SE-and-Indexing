<ABSTRACT>
An optical disk is divided into a plurality of 
sections at least one of which (a first section 12) is made 

a section (formatted in MS-DOS, for example) having a 
format different from the logical format of a CD-ROM. 

Publication data is optically recorded in at least one 
section (a second section 13) of the sections other than 

the first section in accordance with the CD-ROM logical 
format. A CD-ROM utilization tool that utilizes 

publication data in the CD-ROM logical format and a CD-ROM 
emulator for converting a request for access to the 

CD-ROM logical section issued by the CD-ROM utilization 
tool to a request for access to the optical disk are 

recorded in the first section. As a result, publication 
data, in accordance with a CD-ROM logical format, 

accumulated in the realm of CD-ROM electronic 
publications, a tool for creating and converting this 

data and a CD-ROM utilization tool can be put to use 
without being wasted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording medium, a method
of controlling the same and a system utilizing electronic
publications. More specifically, the invention relates to a
recording such as an optical disk medium which is utilized
as an external storage medium of a computer and on which a
dictionary of publishing information is stored, a method of
controlling the recording medium and a system utilizing
electronic publications.Form EP-A-0 294 489 an optical disk and optical disk
unit is known, wherein the optical disk serves both as a
program disk and as a data disk by utilizing the fact that
an optically recording/reproducing disk has a very large
capacity. According to this known optical disk unit onto a
predetermined region of the disk non-rewritably recorded in
advance are a software program necessary for processing the
data recorded in the optical disk or the basic data necessary
for executing the program, as well as an erasing program
for executing the erasing operation for the recording
region. Even in case the software program and the basic
data for executing the program are copied without authorization,
the copy disk is prevented from being used.Form JP-A-2 115 995 there is known a data control system
and recording medium for such system which is formed
for maintaining the secrecy of data by inversely scrambling
desired data to be reproduced in a scrambling table according
a scrambling program when the desired data are to be
reproduced from a recording medium. According to this known
data control system and recording medium, scramble data and
one scrambling program are recorded in a recording 
medium. Further, when the desired data are to be reproduced
from this recording medium, the scrambling program is read
out from this recording medium and stored in a scrambling
table of a data processor, and the desired data to be reproduced
from the recording medium are inversely scrambled
in the scrambling table according to the scrambling program.
Consequently, the data can be correctly obtained from
the recording medium only by using the scrambling program
recorded in the recording medium. Thus, the secrecy of the
recorded data of the recording medium can be kept.The growing use of personal computers and word
processors in industry and in the home has been
accompanied by increasing utilization of electronic
documents, in which written matter such as dictionaries,
manuals, reference books and glossaries heretofore
provided in the form of paper is converted to electronic
form.Since such written matter
