<ABSTRACT>
A surround signal processing apparatus is disclosed, by 
which an inputted rear surround signal can be reproduced, 

together with two-channel front stereophonic signals, 
through a pair of speakers arranged in front of and in 

substantially right-and-left symmetry about a listener, in 
such a way that two sound images of the reproduced rear 

surround signal can be localized at two predetermined 
positions relative to the listener. The inputted rear 

surround signal is processed by a filter. The signal 
processed by the filer is added to one of the stereophonic 

signals, and then outputted to one of the pair of the 
speakers. Further, an inversion signal of the filter-processed 

signal is added to the other of the stereophonic 
signals, and then outputted to the other of the speakers. 

Here, the transfer characteristics of the filter is 
determined as follows: (F - K) / (S - A), where S denotes 

transfer characteristics between one of the speakers and 
one of the listener's ears positioned on same side as the 

speaker, respectively; A denotes transfer characteristics 
between one of the speakers and one of the listener's ears 

positioned on opposite side to the speaker, respectively; 
F denotes transfer characteristics between one of the two 

positions at which two sound images are required to be 
localized and one of the listener's ears positioned on same 

side as the image position, respectively; K denotes 
transfer characteristics between one of the two positions 

at which the two sound images are required to be localized 
and one of the listener's ears positioned on opposite side 

to the image position; and / denotes reverse convolution 
calculation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to sound image
localizing apparatus used when sound signals are reproduced
through speakers, and more specifically to a surround
signal processing apparatus used when surround signals are
reproduced in such way as to surround a listener or
listeners. Here, the sound image implies a virtual sound
source image from which a listener feels that a sound is
reproduced. Further, the sound image can be localized at
any desired position away from a speaker or speakers.Conventionally, in the case where stereophonic sound is
reproduced in such a way as to provide a sound field
expanding behind a listener or to localize a sound image
behind a listener, two front speakers are arranged in front
of a listener for stereophonic sound reproduction and at
least one or two rear speaker are additionally arranged
behind the listener for surround sound reproduction; in
other words, at least three speakers must be arranged at
the minimum around a listener. Further, in the case where
surround sound is reproduced on the basis of a one-system
surround signal or a center channel is additionally
required to be reproduced as with the case of the 3-1
system of high vision HDTV (High Definition TV), one or two
additional center speakers must be arranged. Therefore,
amplifiers and cables corresponding to the numbers of the
reproduced channels are necessary.In other words, as shown in FIG. 1A for instance, in
the case of the surround sound reproduction, it has been
necessary to arrange two front L(left)- and R(right)-channel
speaker sets for stereophonic sound on front left
and right sides of a listener LM, two rear SL(surround
left)- and SR(surround right)-channel speaker sets for
surround sound on rear left and right sides thereof, and 
further a C(center)-channel speaker at the front middle
thereof, respectively.In the ordinary homes, however, since it is difficult
to arrange the two rear speakers and the center speaker
from the standpoint of space and cost, in practice as shown
in FIG. 1B, only L- and R-channel speakers are installed on
the front left and right sides of a listener LM. In this
speaker arrangement, it has become impossible to obtain
sufficient surround sound effect. In the case of the
surround reproduction system using a monophonic surround
signal in particular, although this system has such a
feature that a sound field can be obtained on the rear side
of a listener or the sound image can be shifted, it has
been impossible to obtain such effects as described above
without
