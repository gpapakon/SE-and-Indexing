<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cutter mixer with a rotatable, essentially semi-toroidal bowl (1), in which at least one knife arrangement is located, and with an ejector device which comprises a drivable ejector disc (2) capable of being introduced into the bowl. In order to improve the ejection ratio without impairing the efficiency, provision is made, according to the invention, for the ejector disc (1) to have a working surface (3) which extends in the axial direction of the latter and of which the distance (d) from the outer wall (4) of the bowl (1) is smaller than or equal to the axial width (b) of the working surface (3).

A cutter-mixer with a rotatable, essentially hemi-toroidal dish (1), in which at least one 
cutter device is arranged, and with an ejector device comprising a drivable ejector disc 

(2) which can be inserted into the dish, 
characterized in that
 the ejector disc (2) has a 
diameter which is reduced in steps contrary to the inflow direction (
A
), and the ejector 
disc (2) comprises at least one operating face (3) which extends in the axial direction of 

the said disc (2) and which is arranged at a distance from the outer wall (4) of the dish, 
wherein the distance (
d
) thereof from the outer wall (4) of the dish (1) is less than or 
equal to the axial width (
b
) of the operating face (3). 
A cutter-mixer according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the ejector disc (2) is 
arranged in such a way that the respective operating face (3) of the stepped areas is at 

substantially the same distance from the outer wall (4) of the dish (1). 
A cutter-mixer according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the ejector disc (2) is 
designed with three steps. 
A cutter-mixer according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the operating 
face (3) is made substantially cylindrical. 
A cutter-mixer according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the operating 
face (3) is made substantially conical. 
A cutter-mixer according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 the operating 
face (3) is made substantially convex. 
A cutter-mixer according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that
, [as viewed] in 

the inflow direction (
A
) from the roast [towards] the ejector disc (2), a sealing washer (5) 

which is situated substantially adjacent to the dish (1) is formed on the rear side of the 
ejector disc (2). 
A cutter-mixer according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 a wearing ring (6) is 
arranged on the periphery of the sealing washer (5). 
A cutter-mixer according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that
 the dish (1) is  
 

constructed with a radius approximately constant over the radial extension. 
A cutter-mixer according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 the ejector disc (2) is 
arranged radially to the dish (1). 
A cutter-mixer according to one of Claims 9 or 10, 
characterized in that
 the ejector disc 
(2) is inclined by a maximum of 10Â° to the vertical. 
A cutter-mixer according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that
 the ejector disc 
(2) is produced from plastics material.
