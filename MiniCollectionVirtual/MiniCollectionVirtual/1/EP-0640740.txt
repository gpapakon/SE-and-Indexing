<ABSTRACT>
A power window system employs a computer based control (12) that 
receives signals from a window position sensor (20). 

As the window (16) moves, 
the position sensor produces periodic signals as an output. The computer 

cyclically looks for a change in the frequency of the signals as an 
indication that the window is obstructed and decelerating. Based on the 

instantaneous deceleration, the computer recalls a stored value for motor 
force. The recalled forces are accumulated in synchronism with the 

position sensor output during the deceleration, manifesting the force 
applied to the obstruction as the window presses on it. The window is 

reversed when the accumulated force exceeds a stored value. The 
uppermost window position is a stored value for the position sensor output 

obtained when the window is closed for the first time. Each time the 
window is closed thereafter, an offset is added to that value, the sum 

defining the point at which the window engages the window seal. The 
offset is the change in the position sensor output signal as the window is 

slowed by the seal until the motor stops when a stored value of force is 
applied to the seal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to window lift (power windows) used in 
automobiles. Power windows, once available on only expensive automobiles or 
as an expensive option on some automobiles, have become extremely 
popular. Advances in motor design partly explain their popularity. 
Smaller motor designs have made it possible to install a compact, 
inexpensive motor and window gear system, known as the "regulator", 
into the small narrow door found on many smaller automobiles. Greater 
consumer affluence may also be a contibuting factor to the popularity of 
power windows. But even so, the cost for power windows as a 
percentage of total vehicle cost has become relatively insignificant 
compared to what is was ten or twenty years ago, so much so, that 
manufacturers often include power windows in standard power option 
packages on relatively inexpensive automobiles.. The typical power window moves the window smoothly and rapidly 
compared to the "old" crank handle. The typical power window system is 
designed so that a button must be pressed while the window operates, a 
safety arrangement intended to reduce reaction time when stopping 
window movement if limb lies in the window's path as it closes. In a 
seeming clash of goals, the force exerted by the window must be sufficient  
 
to overcome ice and adequately compress the window seal, but the 
window drive should be incapable of exerting damaging pressure on a 
limb caught between the moving window and the seal. Some systems, 
addressing this problem, monitor motor current: sensing an overcurrent 
condition due to a high load the motor is reversed. This approach does not 
provide precise window motion control. Over time, window frame and seal (gasket) geometries can change, 
producing air leaks between the window and the seal. Driving the 
window hard against the seal can compensate for that but also increases 
the force applied to objects in the window's path. An object of the present invention is to provide a more sensitive, 
adaptive window lift, or power window system, in particular one that 
allows for "unmonitored" window closure; that is, the window control 
button does not have to be depressed continuously to fully close the 
window and compress the seal, but the window will automatically reverse 
when an obstruction is encountered. This object is achieved with the window lift systems according to claims 3 and 1. According to the invention in one aspect according to the method of claim 8 a power window system is 
computer controlled in such a way

A window lift system for closing a window against a seal

switch for commanding motor operation, having: 

a position sensor providing a location signal indicating window 
movement; and 
signal processing means responsive to the operation of the switch - 
to provide a signal to operate the motor comprising means for receiving 

the location signal; for storing a first value of the location signal indicating 
the lowest point of window location and a second value for the location 

signal indicating the highest point of window location; for providing a 
deceleration signal from the location signal according to the rate of change 

over time for said location signal as the window moves; for recalling a 
first stored value of motor force for the magnitude of the deceleration 

signal at a first time; for recalling a second stored value of motor force 
for the magnitude of deceleration at a second successive time interval, for 

adding said first and second values of motor force; for stopping the motor 
if the sum exceeds a stored value when the location signal indicates that 

the window is no higher than a first stored height and stopping the motor 
when the force applied by the motor exceeds a second stored value if the 

location signal indicates that the window is above the first height and is 
less than the second value, the first height being the sum of the second 

value and an offset value; for storing the count when the motor is stopped; 
and for storing the offset value each time the window closes against the 

seal by sensing the change in the location signal between the time the 
motor starts to decelerate and stop on the seal.

when engaging the seal.

against a seal comprising a motor coupled to the window, and a switch for 

commanding motor operation, comprising the steps: 

sensing window location with a sensor coupled to the window;

operating the switch to energize the motor to move the window 
from its lowest to highest location; and 
stopping the motor when the value of motor force is sensed; and 
providing window location signals from the sensor as the window 
moves and from the location signals storing a value for a window location 

when the window is at its lowest point, a value for a window location at 
which the motor begins to slow as a result of the window closing against the seal and a value for a position when the motor 

is stopped because the value of motor force has been sensed.
