<ABSTRACT>
A process for improving the shape retention of chocolate or 
chocolate type products so that they have a reduced 

tendency to deform at elevated temperatures which comprises 
mixing an encapsulated product in particulate form 

comprising capsules of a polyol enclosed within an edible 
lipid with a flowable mixture of chocolate type 

ingredients, the encapsulated product being added in an 
amount to achieve a polyol content of from 0.2 to 5% by 

weight based on the total amount of the resultant 
chocolate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for improving
the shape retention of chocolate or chocolate type products
so that they have a reduced tendency to deform or melt at
elevated temperatures or to stick to the packaging
material.Chocolate products are usually thorough mixtures of liquid
cocoa, cocoa butter, sugar, lecithin and possibly milk and
flavouring substances. They therefore contain fatty
substances which soften and melt between 30 and 35°C.When articles which consist entirely or partly of these
products are exposed to temperatures lying above the
melting point of the aforesaid fatty substances,
(i.e. temperatures occurring during the summer season or in
tropical countries), they tend to lose their original shape
and appearance, and become soft and unpleasant to handle.
If they are wrapped, the surface of the article may adhere
to the wrapper and may produce unsightly fat staining.In the case of chocolate type coatings intended to enrobe
articles such as biscuits, confectionery, etc., the
articles immediately lose their original appearance and are
no longer suitable for consumption when they have been
exposed to high temperature.Different processes have been proposed in order to avoid
the said disadvantages, but the products obtained, although
more resistant to the effects of high temperature, have an
unpleasant taste and a perceptibly coarser texture than
that of normal conched chocolate. In EP-B-189469 there is claimed a method of increasing the
viscosity of a chocolate composition containing cocoa
butter so that said composition will be substantially non-flowable
at a temperature well above the normal melting
point of cocoa butter characterised in comprising mixing
0.2 to 5 wt% of a liquid polyol selected from the group
comprising glycerine, sorbitol, propylene glycol, mannitol,
corn syrup and combinations and solutions thereof to a
chocolate mixture after it has been tempered. However, a
disadvantage of this process is that the chocolate tends to
set rapidly e.g. from 40 to 60 seconds and this allows very
little time for the further processing of the chocolate
e.g. moulding into tablets of the desired shape or
depositing a coating. A disadvantage of this method is that
special additional equipment would be needed to incorporate
the polyol at the latest possible time before further
processing of the chocolate to prevent premature setting of
the chocolate.EP-A-459777 describes and claims a structured fat emulsion
for incorporation into a confectionery coating as the fat
ingredient

<CLAIMS>
A process for improving the shape retention of chocolate
or chocolate type products so that they have a reduced

tendency to deform at elevated temperatures which comprises
mixing an encapsulated product in particulate form

comprising capsules of a polyol enclosed within an edible
lipid with a flowable mixture of chocolate type

ingredients, the encapsulated product being added in an
amount to achieve a polyol content of from 0.2 to 5% by

weight based on the total amount of the resultant
chocolate.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the amount of
polyol in the resultant chocolate is from 0.5 to 3% by

weight based on the total weight of chocolate.
A process according to claim 1 wherein, in the case of
chocolate or certain chocolate type products, the

particulate encapsulated product is mixed with the flowable
mixture of chocolate or chocolate type ingredients after

conching and before, during or after tempering of the
chocolate or chocolate type ingredients.
A process according to claim 3 wherein the encapsulated
product is mixed with untempered chocolate to temper the

chocolate thus making a separate tempering step
unnecessary.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the particulate
encapsulated product remains in substantially solid form

during the mixing and during subsequent processing.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the particles of
the particulate encapsulated product have an average

diameter of from 0.1 to 1000 microns. 
A process according to claim 1 wherein the polyol is
glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol or corn syrup or any

combination thereof.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the edible lipid
is cocoa butter, or a cocoa butter equivalent, substitute

or improver, or palm kernel fat.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the edible lipid
has a melting point which is from substantially the same to

10°C higher than the melting point of the chocolate or
chocolate type product with which it is mixed. 
A chocolate or chocolate type composition having
incorporated therein an encapsulated product in particulate form comprising

capsules of a polyol enclosed within an edible lipid
whereby the polyol content is from 0.2 to 5% by weight

based on the total weight of the chocolate or chocolate
type composition.
