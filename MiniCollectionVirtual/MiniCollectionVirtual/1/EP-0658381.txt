<ABSTRACT>
The appliance for squeezing out pasty material contained in cartridges (10) has a cartridge holder (4) which is constructed in a manner resembling a half-shell and is connected to a supporting wall (5). The supporting wall (5) has, next to a passage opening (6), which is constructed such that it is open on one side, on that side (7) of the supporting wall (5) which is directed towards the interior of the cartridge holder (4), a recess (8) which has a circular cross-section and is arranged coaxially adjoining the passage opening (6) in the radial direction.

Extrusion tool for paste-like substances contained in 
cartridges, comprising a semi-cupshaped cartridge 

receptacle (4) having a casing surface in the direction of 
extrusion which extends along the peripheral area by a 

maximum of approximately 180°, and the cartridge 
receptacle (4) is at the extrusion side of the end area 

connected to a support wall (5) which is provided with a 
substantially centred passage (6) which is open towards one 

side in the same direction as the cartridge receptacle (4), 

characterised in that
 the side (7) of the support wall (5) 
oriented towards the in
side of the cartridge receptacle (4) is 
provided with a coaxially arranged cross-sectionally circular 

recess (8) which is in the radial direction adjacent the 
passage (6). 
Extrusion tool according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
the depth (T) of the recess (8) equals between 0.2 and 0.7 

times the wall thickness of the support wall (5). 
Extrusion tool according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the diameter (D2) of the recess (8) is smaller than the 
inside diameter (D3) of the cartridge receptacle (4). 
Extrusion tool according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 
the diameter (D2) of the recess (8) equals between 0.4 and 

0.8 times the inside diameter (D3) of the cartridge 
receptacle. 
Extrusion tool according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
 the recess (8) comprises a casing 
area the encasement angle (W) of which exceeds 180°.
