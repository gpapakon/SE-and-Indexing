<ABSTRACT>
A method of heat-treating unpasteurized fresh milk, which after packing is distributed and stored at temperatures between 5  DEG C and 10  DEG C, and whereby the content of psychrotrophic, aerobic spores in the milk is reduced at least 10

 times. The milk is directly heated by being injected into a steam atmosphere. Subsequently, the milk and the steam are held at a holding temperature of 130  DEG C to 145  DEG C for less than 1 sec. As a result, it is possible to produce at heat-treated milk maintaining good sensory properties simultaneously with possessing a long keeping ability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of heat-treating
liquid milk product, which after packing is distributed
and stored at no higher than conventional cold
chain temperatures, and whereby the content of psychrotrophic,
aerobic spores in the product is reduced by the
heated product being held at a sufficiently high holding
temperature for a predetermined holding period.Various methods of heat-treating unpasteurized milk are
known. Generally speaking, an increased holding temperature
of the milk causes an increased reduction of the
bacterial content and accordingly, other things being
equal, a longer keeping ability of the milk during succeeding
storage. However, the increased holding temperature
unfortunately results in an increased degree of
chemical change and consequently in increased deterioration
of the sensory properties of the heat-treated milk.The chemical change causing a deterioration of the sensory
properties, such as the development of a so-called
"cooked" taste, is of an extent which inter alia is reflected
in the extent of the denaturation of whey proteins,
said denaturation more or less following parallelly
to the development of the cooked taste. The whey
protein denaturation can be easily demonstrated by chemical
analysis.When unpasteurized milk is low-pasteurized, the heated
milk is held at a holding temperature of about 75°C for
at least 15 sec. and the thus heat-treated milk possesses
particularly good sensory properties. The extent of
the whey protein denaturation by such a method is about 
18 to 20%. No reduction occurs, however, of psychrotrophic,
aerobic spores, with the result that usually
the low-pasteurized milk has a keeping ability of only 2
to 3 days when stored at 10°C.When unpasteurized milk is high-pasteurized, the milk is
held at a holding temperature of about 85 to 90°C for
about 15 sec. with the result that the heat-treated milk
has sensory properties somewhat comparable with those of
the low-pasteurized milk. Such a method involves a whey
protein denaturation of about 30 to 35%. However, this
increased holding temperature surprisingly often involves
an increased conversion of psychrotrophic, aerobic
spores into bacteria and increased growth of these
bacteria, resulting in a shorter keeping ability, especially
at a storing temperature of about 10°C. Therefore,
a particularly reserved attitude applies to heat-treating
unpasteurized milk at increased holding temperatures
to product treated milk to be distributed and
stored at only the conventional cold chain

<CLAIMS>
A method comprising heat-treating non-sterile milk
product, whereby the content of psychrotrophic, aerobic

spores in the product is reduced by the heated product
being held at a sufficiently high holding temperature for

a predetermined holding period, but the product remains
non-sterile, packing the heat-treated, non-sterile product,

and distributing and storing the packed, non-sterile
product at no higher than conventional cold chain

temperatures, characterized in that said heat-treating is
by direct heating of the non-sterile product and by then

holding the heated, non-sterile product at a holding
temperature in the range of 130°C to 145°C for a holding

period of no more than 1 sec.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
the holding temperature and period are in the range of

133°C to 145°C for less than 1 sec.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the direct heating is carried out by contacting the

product with steam.
A method according to claim 3, characterized in that
the direct heating is by a steam infusion method, where the

product is injected into a steam atmosphere.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the holding of the heated product is

at a holding temperature of 135°C to 143°C.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the holding of the product at the

holding temperature is for a holding period of more than
0.25 sec.
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that
the holding of the product at the holding temperature is 

for a holding period of 0.5 to 0.9 sec.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterized in that whey protein denaturation of between

about 30% and about 40% occurs.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the content of psychrotrophic,

aerobic spores is reduced as aforesaid at least 10
6
 times.
A method as claimed in any preceding claim,
characterized in that the product is selected from the

group consisting of unpasteurized milk and cream, low-pasteurized
milk and cream and unpasteurized and low-pasteurized,

fat-reduced milk.
A method according to claim 10, characterized in that
the product is unpasteurized milk.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein
said packing is under lower than aseptic filling

conditions.
A method according to claim 12, wherein the packing
is under pure filling conditions.
