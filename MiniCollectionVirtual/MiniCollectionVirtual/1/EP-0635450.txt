<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the mounting of the working jib (7) and of the associated counterbalancing jib (8) of tower cranes, used on building and civil engineering work construction sites. The jib elements (15,16,17,18) are aligned and assembled on the ground with their stay (13), then the jib stay (13) and, possibly, the one (111) belonging to the counterbalancing jib (8) is or are lifted up and aligned with the aid of an auxiliary item of mounting plant (69). Next, using the same item of plant (69), the whole of the jib (7) or of the counterbalancing jib (8) together with its stay (13,111) lifted up and aligned is raised and is offered up facing the top of the tower (6) so that the free ends (56,122) of the stays (13,111) are offered up correctly to the very top of the head of the tower (6) to allow direct connection (at 14,138). This method improves safety, and it decreases the duration for which the auxiliary item of mounting plant (69) is immobile.
