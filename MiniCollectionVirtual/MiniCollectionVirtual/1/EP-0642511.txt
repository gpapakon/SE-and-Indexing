A process for preparing 5-dichloroacetyl-3,3,6-trimethyl-9-oxo-1,5-diazabicyclo[4,3,0]nonane 

(I) 

 
by reacting 3,3,6-trimethyl-9-oxo-1,5-diazabicyclo[4,3,0]
nonane 
II 


 
with dichloroacetyl chloride in the presence of a solvent 

and of a base, wherein 

a) this reaction is carried out in a two-phase system 
consisting of a virtually water-insoluble organic 

solvent and water and, in this case, sodium or 
potassium hydroxide is metered in as base in 

accordance with the consumption of dichloroacetyl 
chloride in such a way that the aqueous phase has a 

pH of from 7 to 9, and 
b) the solid product which is formed is separated off. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, which starts 
from a mixture of 3,3,6-trimethyl-9-oxo-1,5-diazabicyclo[4,3,0]
nonane 
II in a virtually water-insoluble 

organic solvent as is produced in the preparation of II 
from 4-oxopentanoic acid and neopentanediamine with  

 
continuous removal of the water produced thereby. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein a 
mono- or polyalkylated benzene with 7 to 12 carbon atoms 

is used as organic solvent. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
reaction is carried out at a pH of from 7.5 to 8.8. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
reaction is carried out at from 20 to 60Â°C.
