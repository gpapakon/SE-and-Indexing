<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a reactor (1) for smelting combustion residues, the reactor having a vertical dividing wall (4) with return-flow openings (7) and an overflow (6). Foamed slag is produced in a chamber (3) by blowing gases in through floor-mounted nozzles (10) and the foamed slag collapsed in a second chamber (5) or in the return-flow channel. After the required degree of transformation, the fluid slag is discharged through the slag run-off outlet (11).

A reactor (1) for melting inorganic combustion residues
optionally loaded with heavy metals and/or heavy metal

compounds, wherein the charge is melted and fed with gases
and, in particular, gaseous oxygen as well as optionally fuels

and oxidic slag is drawn of at temperatures of above 1400°C,
characterized in that the reactor (1) comprises two chambers

(3, 5) separated by a substantially vertical wall (4), that
the wall (4) comprises an overflow (6) and, following the

bottom (9) of the reactor (1), backflow openings (7) for the
melt, that a charging opening (2) for the charge runs into one

of the chambers (3) and a tap opening (11) for oxidic slag
runs into the other chamber (5), and that tuyeres (10) for

blowing in gases such as, e.g., oxygen and optionally fuels
are arranged in the chamber (3) connected with the charging

means, on the bottom (9) thereof.
A reactor according to claim 1, characterized in that an
immersed wall (8) is arranged in the chamber provided with the

bottom tuyeres (10), near the overflow (6) of the partition
wall (4), the lower edge of which immersed wall is located

below the overflow edge.
A reactor according to any one of claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that a further reducingly operated heated reactor is

connected to the slag tap, from which reactor Cu-Sn-Ni alloys,
a Zn(O)/Pb(O) concentrate as well as a slag are discharged,

which is granulated and further used as a mixed cement.
A process for melting combustion residues by means of a
reactor according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized

in that gas is blown in to an extent which yields a specific
foam weight of the foamed slag formed, of between 0.06 and

0.15 kg/l at a temperature of above 1400°C in the chamber (3)
connected with the charging means. 
A process according to claim 4, characterized in that a
partial amount of the overflowing oxidized slag is drawn off

at temperatures of above 1450°C and subjected to partial
reduction.
A process according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that
the charge is preheated prior to being introduced into the

oxidation reactor (1) or that the charge is introduced with
the latent heat from the combustion plant.
