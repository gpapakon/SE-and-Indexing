<ABSTRACT>
Optical paths to propagate a plurality of 
optical information signals intersect optical paths to 

transmit lights to a plurality of subscribers. Light 
power dividing and propagation direction changing device 

(20) to separate the requested optical information signals 
are arranged at the intersecting points. Losses of 

the optical information signals due to the separation 
are compensated by optical amplification, so that the 

signals can be distributed to all of the subscribers 
while keeping a predetermined intensity. Thus, the same 

photosignal can be distributed to a plurality of subscribers. 
The system can be easily expanded in correspondence 

to an increase in number of optical information 
signals and an increase in number of subscribers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
device which is used in an optical fiber communication 
and, more particularly, to an optical device which is 
suitable for an optical network of an information 
distribution type represented by a cable television and 
to a synthesizing method of such an optical device. The communication network has been supported 
so far by the techniques of electronic circuits 
(reference literature: Minoru Akiyama, et al., "Digital 
Telephone Exchange", Sangyo Tosho Co., Ltd., published 
in 1986). In recent years, the development of the 
optical fiber communication which can transmit information 
to a long distance at a high speed is remarkable 
and the realization of the optical communication is 
progressing. Among them, the optical network of the 
information distribution type is advancing in such a 
direction as to distribute a larger amount of information 
to a larger number of terminals. In case of the 
optical cable television as an example, there is a 
tendency such that the number of channels and the number 
of subscribers increase. When the number of channels 
increases, it is necessary to widen a range of the 
signal selection. According to a method of selecting  
 
the channel in a receiver which the subscriber possesses, 
it is difficult to cope with an increase in number 
of channels. It is, therefore, necessary to use a 
method whereby, on the side which serves information, 
the channel selection is controlled and only the 
necessary signal is distributed to the subscriber in 
accordance with a request from the subscriber. A 
construction to realize such a method by present existing 
devices is as shown in Fig. 2. Signals 1-1 to 1-m 
of respective channels are distributed to selectors 3-1 
to 3-n corresponding to subscribers (1 to n) by optical 
amplifying distributors 2-1 to 2-m. Distribution 
signals 4-1 to 4-n selected by the selectors 3-1 to 3-n 
in accordance with request signals 5-1 to 5-n are sent 
to the subscribers. Each of the optical amplifying distributors 2-1 
to 2-m can be realized by a combination of an optical 
amplifier and a photocoupler. As a selector of a 
photosignal, it is possible to apply an optical switch 
as described in the literature, "Journal of Lightwave 
Technology", Vol. 9, No. 7, pages 871-877, 1991. According to the above conventional method, 
since an increase in number of subscribers or an 
increase in number of channels causes an increase in 
number of amplification distributions or an increase in 
number of channels which
