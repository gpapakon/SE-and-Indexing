<ABSTRACT>
Auxiliary drive for a shaft end comprising a belt pulley, a planet carrier with at least one first and one second planet wheel, which are rigidly coupled and have different numbers of teeth, the first planet wheel meshing with first gear revolving with the shaft and the second planet wheel meshing with a second gear which can be rotated relative to the shaft, a brake which can be engaged and disengaged being provided between a permanently stationary part and a part capable of relative rotation, and comprising a freewheel to prevent reverse relative rotation of the second gear relative to the shaft end, and the first and the second gear being arranged radially within the planet carrier, the freewheel being arranged between the planet carrier and the part capable of relative rotation, the belt pulley surrounding the freewheel, the planet carrier and the brake radially at the outside, at least partially, and the belt pulley and the planet carrier being connected together rigidly for rotation in common.

<CLAIMS>
An auxiliary drive for a shaft (1), comprising a 
pulley (13), a planet carrier (7) having at least one 

first and second planet wheel (8, 6) which are rigidly 
coupled and have a differing number of teeth, the first 

planet wheel (8) being engaged with a first gearwheel 
(9), which rotates with the shaft (1), and the second 

planet wheel (6) with a second gearwheel (5), which can 
be turned relative to the shaft (1), a switch-on and 

switch-off brake (4) being provided between a permanently 
stationary part and a relatively turnable part (18) and 

a freewheel (16) being provided for preventing the second 
gearwheel (5) from being turned back in relation to the 

shaft (1), and the first and second gearwheels (9, 5) 
being disposed radially within the planet carrier (7), 

characterized in that the freewheel (16) is disposed 
between the planet carrier (7) and the relatively 

turnable part (18), in that the pulley (13) at least 
partially encloses the freewheel (16), the planet carrier 

(7) and the brake (4) radially on the outside, and in 
that the pulley (13) and the planet carrier (7) are 

connected in rotationally locking engagement. 
An auxiliary drive according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the planet carrier (7) and the pulley 

(13) are connected by a torsion spring (24). 
An auxiliary drive according to claim 2, characterized 
in that the torsion spring (24) consists of an 

elastomeric material and connects axially adjacent faces 
of the pulley (13) and of the planet carrier (7). 
An auxiliary drive according to claim 3, characterized  
 

in that the pulley (13) is supported on the 
planet carrier (7) such that it can be turned relative 

thereto. 
An auxiliary drive according to either of claims 
3 and 4, characterized in that the pulley (13) encloses 

the torsion spring (24) on the outside at a small radial 
distance from it. 
An auxiliary drive according to any of claims 2 
to 5, characterized in that the relative turnability of 

the pulley (13) in relation to the planet carrier (7) is 
limited by at least one stop (12) of the one part, which 

stop can be brought into engagement with at least one 
counter-stop of the other part. 
An auxiliary drive according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the stop (12) and the counter-stop are 

embraced radially on the outside by a protective sleeve 
(11) rigidly connected to the shaft (1). 
An auxiliary drive according to claim 7, characterized 
in that an inertia ring (15) is secured to the 

protective sleeve (11), such that it can be turned 
relative thereto, by means of a rubber spring (14).
