<ABSTRACT>
A servovalve apparatus for use in fluid systems which 
comprises an elongate flexible valve element (408) having a 

fixed end and a free end which is moveable back and forth 
along a generally arcuate path. A receiving plate (428) is 

provided adjacent the free end of the valve element (408), the 
receiving plate (428) having one or more channels (432,436) formed 

therein for receiving fluid, and a bore (440) for delivering 
fluid. Preferably, the channels (432,436) and bore (440) in the receiving 

plate (428) originate within and communicate with a concave 
socket in the receiving plate (428) which has substantially the 

same radius of curvature as the path over which the free 
end of the valve element (408) moves during flexure. A 

deflection cup (412) is disposed on the free end of the valve 
element (408) to move adjacent the surface of the concave 

socket and selectively redirect fluid from the bore (440) to 

one of the channels (432,436).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel servovalve 
apparatus for use in fluid systems to selectively direct 
or "port" fluid flow. Fluid systems are frequently used in mechanical 
devices as a means of controlling or positioning various 
mechanical components. As used herein, the term "fluid" 
is used generally to refer to any substance which is 
capable of flowing under pressure through a conduit. 
Thus, the term "fluid" encompasses both gasses and 
liquids, and the general term "fluid systems" is 
intended to include both pneumatic and hydraulic 
systems. A fluid system typically comprises a pump for 
pressurizing the fluid which is then used to provide the 
force necessary to position and/or control a desired 
mechanical component. For example hydraulic systems are 
often used to control shovels or scoops on heavy 
construction machinery. Similarly, pneumatic systems 
are frequently employed in the field of robotics to 
control the position and movement of a desired object, 
such as, for example, a robotic arm.  Appropriate fluid controlling valves are essential 
for the proper operation of virtually all fluid systems. 
For example, a valve may be used to direct pressurized 
fluid first to one side and then the other of a plunger 
which is slideably positioned within an elongated 
housing. The operation of the valve thus controls the 
flow of pressurized fluid to each side of the plunger 
and thereby the position of the plunger within the 
housing. Examples of some of the more commonly used valves 
in fluid systems are poppet valves (which control fluid 
flow by a "pinching" action) and spool valves (which 
control fluid flow by selective alignment of fluid 
channels in a spool with orifices in a sleeve in which 
the spool is slideably disposed). Poppet valves are 
generally not well suited for servovalve applications, 
typically have a significant lag time in their 
operation, and many times have leakage problems. Spool 
valves require very tight tolerances to avoid leakage 
between the spool and sleeve thus making them expensive 
to manufacture and maintain. Also, because of the tight 
tolerances, significant frictional forces can be 
generated causing wear in the valves. A valve having somewhat more recent origin is the 
jet pipe valve, often called a flow-dividing valve. A 
jet pipe valve comprises a fluid pipe having a small 
orifice on its downstream end. Fluid flows through the 
pipe at a substantially constant rate, and the small 
orifice produces a "jet" of fluid out of the end of the 
pipe. The

<CLAIMS>
A servovalve apparatus for use in fluid systems in 
controlling the flow of a fluid stream comprising 

an elongate flexible valve element (408) having a fixed 

end and a free end which is moveable back and forth along 
a generally arcuate path, 

receiving plate means (428) which defines a generally 
arcuate surface area adjacent to the arcuate path, said 

receiving plate means having a bore (440) terminating at 
a location along the arcuate surface area for carrying 

the fluid stream to the arcuate path, and at least one 
fluid channel (432, 436) terminating at the arcuate 

surface area adjacent to the bore, 
cup means (412) mounted on the free end of the valve 

element for receiving the fluid stream from the bore and 
porting it into the fluid channel when the free end is 

deflected to a certain position, and 
means (42,64) for selectively deflecting the free end of 

the valve element to said certain position and out of 
said certain position. 
Apparatus as in Claim 1 wherein the cup means (412) is 
formed with a hollow (416) and a sidewall (420) 

circumscribing the hollow, said hollow facing the 
receiving plate means with the rim of the sidewall 

disposed adjacent to the arcuate surface area. 
Apparatus as in Claim 2 wherein the hollow (416) of the 
 

cup means widens with depth into the cup means. 
Apparatus as in Claim 2 wherein the receiving plate means

respective opposite side of the bore, and wherein the rim 
of the sidewall of the cup means substantially covers the
