 SUBSΗTUTED INDOLIZINO[l,2-b]QUINOLINONESThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/870,649, filed on April 17, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/783,063, filed on October 25, 1991, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/606,216, filed on October 31, 1990.Scope of the InventionThis invention relates to methods of treating viral infections, antiviral compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. More specifically, this invention relates to a method of treating viral infections, certain indolizino[l,2-b]quinolinyl derivatives which have antiviral activity and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.BackgroundCertain lH-pyrano[3',4':6,7]indolizino[l,2-b]quinolinones are known to have cytotoxic and antiviral activity. Camptothecin is an example of such compounds. It is a water-insoluble, cytotoxic alkaloid produced by Camptotheca acuminata trees indigenous to China and Nothapodytes foetida trees indigenous to India. Camptothecin and its close congeners are known to inhibit eukaryotic topoisomerase I. In fact, the cytotoxic and antitumor activity of camptothecin and its close congeners results from inhibition of eukaryotic topoisomerase I {Cancer Res. 1988, 48, 1722; Molec. Pharmacol. 1988, 34, 755). Compounds that are related in structure to camptothecin but do not inhibit eukaryotic topoisomerase I are not cytotoxic to mammalian cells and have no antitumor activity (J. Med. Chem. 1988, 32, 715; Cancer Res. 1989, 49, 1465; Cancer Res. 1989, 49, 4358).A number of investigators have shown that camptothecin possesses antiviral activity. However, although camptothecin has demonstrated antiviral activity in in vitro tissue culture systems, camptothecin and its close analogs that have a hydroxylactone moiety cannot be considered as useful in vivo antiviral agents 

because they undesirably inhibit mammalian topoisomerase I, as well as host cell DNA replication, and are cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Furthermore, camptothecin is not an attractive candidate for drug development as an antiviral agent because of unacceptable dose-limiting toxicity, unpredictable toxicity, and poor aqueous solubility, and/or unacceptable shelf life stability.There is a need for new antiviral agents. Substituted _ndoli-άno[l,2-b]quϊnoIinones that lack the a-hydroxylactone moiety of camptothecin have been shown to be non-cytotoxic to mammalian cells and to lack antitumor activity Ann. Rev. Pharmcol. Toxicol. 1977, 17, 117; J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 715). This is because these
