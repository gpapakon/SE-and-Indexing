<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a semi-mountable plough comprising an elongate plough frame having a long forward frame section (1) carrying a plurality of plough bodies (2), a short intermediate section (3) pivotally connected to the rear end of the forward section (1), and a rear frame section (5) pivotally connected at its forward end to the rear of the intermediate section (3), with the plough being of a reversible type and the sections (1, 3 and 5) being pivotable relative to each other in a generally horizontal plane to take up new positions suitable for movement of the plough in a reverse direction. The rear frame section (5) is pivotable about a horizontal pivot (11) so as to follow any unevennesses in the ground, and an hydraulically operated actuator (18, 19, 12') is coupled with said rear frame section and is operative to urge the frame section to pivot downwardly about said horizontal pivot (11) and thereby maintain the plough bodies (21) carried by the rear frame section (5) at a required ploughing depth, and in that a hydraulic control circuit is connected to said actuator and includes a pressure regulator (20) to control the hydraulic pressure supplied to the actuator (12, 19, 12') so that a controlled biasing force is applied to the rear frame section (5) which maintains the required ploughing depth of the plough bodies (21), but which can be overcome so as to allow pivoting movement of the rear frame section (5) in order to follow the contour of the ground which is being ploughed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multi-share plough and
particularly, though not exclusively, to a semi-mountable
plough of the reversible type, comprising an elongate plough
frame carrying a plurality of plough bodies and being
supported on wheel means, said elongate plough frame
comprising a front plough frame section and a rear plough
frame section , with the rear plough frame section being
articulated directly to said front plough frame section or
indirectly via an intermediate frame section (see DE-U-9205779).In semi-mounted ploughs, the plough frame carries a
large number of plough bodies, and therefore the plough frame
has to be divided in order to constitute two mutually
articulated frame sections, namely a front plough frame
section and a rear plough frame section, and optionally with
an intermediate frame section between the front and rear
plough frame sections.The purpose of such an articulated plough frame is to
allow the plough to follow in a sufficient degree
unevennesses and roughness of the ground.Moreover, long semi-mounted ploughs have a support
frame of such a longitudinal extent that the rear end portion
possesses a tendency of being deflected resiliently.When the ploughs become very long, the rearmost plough
bodies will hang somewhat lower than the intermediate plough
bodies. Therefore, this makes it difficult to control the
rear portion.This results in that the rearmost plough bodies - when
the plough is placed into the soil at the beginning of each
furrow - start to plough simultaneously with the foremost
plough bodies. This results in the beginning of each furrow,
as seen in a top plan view, after ploughing, showing a
triangular area that has become ploughed and a triangular
area that has not become ploughed.With a twelve-share plough, a considerable area will
receive such an uneven ploughing. Normally, this area is ploughed laterally of the
furrows in a final ploughing operation. When doing so, the
soil becomes partly reversed back again within said
triangular areas which already have been ploughed such that
the soil which should have been the lowermost, comes
uppermost again.The result of all this is poor and uneven growth within
said areas.Attempts have been made to control the rear plough
frame section through locking the link or pivot constituting
the articulation between the front and rear plough frame
sections or between the latter and an intermediate frame
section, respectively, during the lifting and reversal of a
semi-mounted reversible plough. Said link or pivot is
released

<CLAIMS>
A multi-share plough comprising an elongate plough
frame having a forward frame section (1, 3) adapted to be

connected at its leading end (9) to the rear of a towing
vehicle (7), a rear frame section (5) pivotally connected at

its forward end to the rear of the forward section (13) so as
to be capable of pivoting upwardly and downwardly relative to

the forward section in order to follow unevennesses in the
surface of the ground being ploughed, and a plurality of

plough bodies (2) mounted on said frame sections (1, 3, 5)
an hydraulically operated actuator (18,

19, 12') being coupled with said rear frame section and
operative to urge the frame section to pivot downwardly about

said horizontal pivot (11) and thereby maintain the plough
bodies (21) carried by the rear frame section (5) at a

required ploughing depth, characterised in that a hydraulic control
circuit is connected to said actuator and includes a pressure

regulator (20) to control the hydraulic pressure supplied to
the actuator (12, 19, 12') so that a controlled biasing force

is applied to the rear frame section which maintains the

required ploughing depth of the plough bodies, but which can
be overcome so as to allow pivoting movement of the rear

frame section (5) in order to follow the contour of the
ground which is being ploughed.
A plough according to claim 1, in which the
actuator comprises two cylinders (18, 19) positioned one

above and one below the generally horizontal pivot (11).
A plough according to Claims 1 or 2 and taking the
form of a semi-mountable reversible plough.
A plough according to claim 3, in which the rear
frame section (5) is connected indirectly to the forward

frame section (1) via a short intermediate frame section (3)
which forms a rearward prolongation of the forward frame

section.
A plough according to claim 4, in which the
intermediate section (3) is pivotally connected at its 

forward end to the rear of the forward frame section (1) and
at its rear end to the front of the rear frame section (5),

each pivotal connection being an upright pivot which allows
relative generally horizontal lateral pivotal movement to

take place for each reversal of the plough body.
A plough according to any one of Claims 2 to 5, in
which a 4/3 way control valve (16) controls the routing of

pressure fluid to the cylinders (18, 19) of the actuators and
which is operative in a first mode (C) to extend the rod 12'

of one of the cylinders 18, in a second mode (A) to extend
rod 12' of the other of the cylinders (19) and in a third

mode (B) to block supply of fluid to or from the cylinders
(18, 19).
A plough according to Claim 6, in which the control
valve (16) is mounted on a movable part of the frame of a

reversible plough, and a toggle linkage (17) is operative to
operate the control valve (16) only when the plough has been

fully adjusted to either one of its two ploughing positions.
A plough according to Claim 7, in which the toggle
linkage (17) is coupled with a control arm (13) on which is

mounted the depth control wheel (6) of the rear frame section
(5), and is triggered to an operative state when the depth

control wheel (6) is adjusted to the ploughing position.
