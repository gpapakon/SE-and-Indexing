<ABSTRACT>
Wood pulp, such as kraft, chemical or hybrid pulp, 
is subjected to a bleaching process wherein it is treated 

first with one or more oxidising agents such as oxygen, 
ozone or hydrogen peroxide, and then with a reducing agent 

such as sodium borohydride or sodium hydrosulfite. A 
further treatment with an oxidising agent can be carried 

out after the reducing treatment. Brightness may be 
further enhanced by treatment with an enzyme such as 

xylanase or with a chelant such as diethylenetriamine 
pentaacetic acid (DTPA).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for bleaching kraft or sulfite
wood pulp to enhance its brightness, to improve brightness
stability and generally to improve the physical properties
of the pulp.Wood pulp can be produced by numerous different
processes which can be classified under the broad headings
of mechanical, chemical and hybrid processes. Among the
chemical processes are the kraft process wherein the wood
chips or the like are treated at elevated temperature and
alkaline pH with sodium sulfide, sodium hydroxide and
sodium carbonate, and the sulfite process wherein the wood
chips are treated at acid pH, again at elevated
temperature, with sodium and magnesium bisulfites. The
process of the present invention has been found to be
particularly advantageous in relation to pulps produced by
these chemical processes, but is not limited to any
particular type of wood pulp.Hitherto, different chemical bleaching processes
have been used for different types of wood pulp, and in
the past these have generally comprised treatments with
various combinations of chlorine, chlorine dioxide, sodium
hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite. For example kraft pulp
has conventionally been treated with chlorine followed by
two successive cycles of sodium hydroxide and chlorine
dioxide. Sulfite pulp on the other hand has been treated
successively with chlorine, sodium hydroxide, sodium
hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide.Because of the pollution risks associated with the
use of chlorine, and in particular the risk to the ozone 
layer, in recent years ways have been studied to replace
chlorine in such bleaching treatments and ultimately to
replace chlorine compounds as well. To this end, various
combinations of oxidising agents have been tried and in
particular oxygen itself, ozone and hydrogen peroxide have
been used in various combinations.Kassepi et al (TAPPI) Pulping Conf, (Toronto) Proc,
327-340 (Oct 1992) disclose the effect of ozonisation on
kraft-oxygen (K-O) and kraft oxygen-peroxide (K-OP) pulps.
The K-OP pulps generally responded better to ozone
bleaching than K-O pulps. It was found that too high an
ozone concentration gave rise to carbohydrate degradation
and decreased viscosity of the pulp.According to Patt et al Holzforschung 45 (Suppl)
87-92 (September 1991), ozone can be used effectively in
both pre-bleaching and final bleaching but both lignins and
carbohydrates tend to be attacked. Carbohydrate
degradation has to be suppressed by preacidification of the
pulp, low-temperature bleaching, slow addition of ozone
