<ABSTRACT>
A capacitive position transducer with reduced sensitivity to 
particulate and fluid contaminants. The electrodes of the position transducer 

are provided with a relatively thick coating of dielectric material so that the 
series impedance of the dielectric coatings is at least equal to the maximum 

capacitive impedance between the coatings whether or not there are any 
contaminants positioned therebetween. In one embodiment, the coatings are 

spaced-apart from each other to create an air gap while in another 
embodiment the coatings are resiliently biased toward each other so that the 

coatings slide along each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to capacitive transducers, and more
particularly, to an apparatus for making such transducers less
sensitive to liquid and particulate contaminants located between the capacitive
electrodes of such transducers.Capacitive position transducers are becoming increasingly
common in manufacturing industries. These capacitive transducers include a
pair of substrates that move relative to each other along a measurement axis.
A set of electrodes is carried by each of the substrates, with the electrodes of
one substrate being positioned close to the electrodes on the other substrate to
form a capacitor therebetween. The electrodes on each of the substrates are
connected to conventional circuitry for providing an indication of the relative
position between the two substrates as a function of the capacitance between
various electrodes in each set. The capacitive position transducer may be of
the incremental type, in which the circuitry provides only an indication of
incremental movement from a known point, or an absolute position type, in
which the circuitry provides an indication of the relative position between the
two substrates regardless of whether their initial relative position is known.
Capacitive position transducers of these types are disclosed in U.S.-A-4,420,754
and 4,879,508,Capacitive position transducers are often used as the principle
component of electronic calipers for measuring thickness and other physical
parameters. Although these calipers are sometimes used in dry, relatively,
clean environments, such as inspection rooms or engineering offices, such
calipers are often used to measure dimensions of work pieces in machine
shops and other relatively dirty environments. When used in these
environments, such calipers can become contaminated by particulate matter
and fluids, such as cooling or cutting fluids. The liquid or particulate
contaminants may find their way between each set of electrodes and affect the 
capacitance between the electrodes in a manner that is not related to the
relative position between the substrates along the measurement axis.
Contaminants between the electrodes of a capacitive position transducer
degrade performance because the particulate or fluid may be a dielectric
having a dielectric constant that is different from the dielectric constant of air
that is in an air gap between the sets of electrodes. The capacitance between
electrodes on opposite sides of the contaminate will thus be greater than the
capacitance between other electrodes having the

A capacitive position transducer having a first substrate

arranged along a measurement axis, and a second substrate

coupling between the first and second sets of electrodes

provides an indication of the relative position between the
first and second substrates along the measurement axis,

wherein a layer of dielectric material (92,94) coats at
least one set of first and second sets of electrodes

electrodes is coated, or between respective dielectric

constant of the dielectric when only one set of electrodes

is coated, or the sum of the ratios of thickness to
dielectric constant for each dielectric material when both

sets of electrodes are coated is greater than the thickness
