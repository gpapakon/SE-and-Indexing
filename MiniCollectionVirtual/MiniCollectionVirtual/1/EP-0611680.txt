<ABSTRACT>
Alarm for motor vehicles which are equipped with a plurality of, in particular, acoustic and/or optical signalling devices and at least one switch (32) for triggering the alarm. The signalling devices are divided into two groups (2, 14), both groups of signalling devices being connected to a central control device (30) which has a triggering input (52) which is connected to the switch. By activating the switch (32) once the first (2) of the two groups can be activated and by activating the switch again the second group (14) of signalling devices can be activated. The alarm permits aggression to be responded to in a manner appropriate for the situation, and is characterised by control which is simple, easy to understand and therefore reliable even in emergency situations.

An alarm system for motor vehicles, comprising a 
plurality of, especially acoustical and/or optical, 

signalling means and at least one switch (32) for triggering 
the alarm system, characterized in that the signalling means 

are divided into two groups (2, 14), that both groups of 
signalling groups are connected to a central control 

apparatus (30) which has a trigger output (52) connected 
with the switch, and that the first (2) of the two groups 

can be activated by a single actuation of the switch and the 
second (14) group of signalling means can be activated via 

the control apparatus actuating the switch anew. 
Alarm system according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the first group (2) contains those signalling means (4, 6, 

8, 10, 12) the activation of which cannot be recognized by 
an occupant within a vehicle. 
Alarm system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that association of the signalling means with both groups 

(2, 14) can be determined by configuration of the central 
control apparatus (
30). 
Alarm system according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the configuration of the control apparatus (30) can be 

adjusted at least partially by means of adjustment elements 
accessible by the user. 
Alarm system according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the configuration of the control apparatus (30) can be at 

least partially adjusted by circuitry on a circuit board.
