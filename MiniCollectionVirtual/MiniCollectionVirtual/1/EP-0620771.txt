<ABSTRACT>
A device is disclosed for controlling the stopper (5) of a metallurgical vessel (1), in particular the distribution gutter of a continuous casting plant having an up-and-down movable stopper (5) supported in a bearing frame (10) movable with respect to the metallurgical vessel (1). The bearing frame for the up-and-down movable stopper (5) is supported outside of the metallurgical vessel (1) so as to move transversely to the reciprocal movement (11) of the stopper (5) and is detachably and lockably linked to the metallurgical vessel (1). The stopper mechanism (9) may thus be easily separated from the metallurgical vessel (1), without extensive manipulations, so that for example the metallurgical vessel (1) may be exchanged without having to dismount the whole stopper mechanism (5, 9).

<CLAIMS>
A device for controlling the stopper of a metallurgical
vessel and, in particular, of the distributing gutter of a

continuous casting plant, comprising a liftable and lowerable
stopper which is supported in a carrying frame displaceable

relative to the metallurgical vessel and capable of being
locked with the metallurgical vessel in a detachable manner,

characterized in that the carrying frame (10) for the liftable
and lowerable stopper (5) is supported outside the

metallurgical vessel so as to be displaceable transverse to
the lifting direction of the stopper (5) on a portal (21)

movable outside the metallurgical vessel (1).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
liftable and lowerable stopper (5) respectively the carrying

frame (10) of the same is guided so as to be displaceable
transverse to the moving direction of the portal (21).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the carrying frame (10) is formed with a claw

(17) which cooperates with a complementarily designed coupling
member (18) provided on the external side of the metallurgical

vessel (1) in the operating position of the stopper (5).
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that the
carrying frame (10) is liftable and lowerable relative to the

portal (21) by a driving means (27) and, in particular, a
chain drive.
