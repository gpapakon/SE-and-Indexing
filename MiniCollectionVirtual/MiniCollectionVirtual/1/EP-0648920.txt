<ABSTRACT>
A method for safely cutting hollow bodies filled with 
metallic Na for disposal comprises the steps of cutting the 

hollow bodies with plasma jet so as to oxidize metallic Na 
while conveying said hollow bodies in a hermetically sealed 

housing, throwing the cut hollow bodies into a neutralizing 
aqueous solution tank, then taking out said cut hollow bodies 

from the tank, collecting a fume produced while cutting the 
hollow bodies, spraying water over the fume and recovering 

the fume. An apparatus for carrying out the above method is 
also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for processing engine valves, and particularly to a 
processing method and apparatus which are used when used 
hollow bodies filled with metallic sodium (Na), such as a 
metallic sodium engine valves or the like employed as valves 
for internal combustion engines, is disposed of. 
Such a method and apparatus is known from US-A-3 918 961. Recently, requirements on automobile engines are becoming 
increasingly higher toward better efficiencies, lower 
fuel consumption, lighter weight, and lower noise in view of 
tightening regulations (for example, the U.S CAFE regulations 
and the like). As a result, requirements placed on engine 
valves have also become tighter for higher operating temperatures, 
increases in the number of valves used, and decreases 
in their weight, because an increasing number of engines now 
burn fuel at leaner air-to-fuel ratios. One of the most effective means among solutions to such 
problems is a hollow engine valve filled with metallic sodium 
(Na). As shown in Fig. 3, a metallic sodium-filled hollow 
engine valve 1 achieves lighter weight by having a hollow  
 
inner cavity in the valve body 2. Due to reduced kinetic 
energy losses, it also shows reduced fuel consumption and is 
more quiet because noise is reduced when the valve is seated. 
Furthermore, the hollow engine valve also achieves higher 
heat transfer efficiency with metallic sodium (hereinafter 
referred to as "metallic Na") filled in the hollow valve 
body. Metallic sodium exhibits characteristic properties of 
a low specific gravity, a low melting point and a high heat 
transfer coefficient, so that the hollow engine valve filled 
with metallic Na can deal with higher temperatures of combustion 
gas. The use of the metallic Na-filled hollow engine valve 1 
has been gradually increasing mainly for high-end models of 
automobiles, and is now spreading for also mid-range cars 
with increasing numbers of valves used. Metallic Na is 
extremely active and dangerous, so that insertion or filling 
of metallic Na is carried out under strict control during the 
manufacturing stage. After the car is sold to the final 
user, however, such metallic Na-filled hollow engine valves 
are discarded, and may be cut off together with conventional 
solid engine valves and come into contact with water at a 
service garage for regulatory or periodical inspections or at 
a wrecking yard. In such cases, explosion may occur due to 
heat evolution and generation of dissolution gas,

throwing the cut hollow bodies into a neutralizing 
aqueous solution tank for neutralization; 
then taking out said cut hollow bodies from the tank; 
collecting a fume produced while cutting the hollow 
bodies; and 
spraying water over the fume and recovering the fume 
into said neutralizing aqueous solution tank. 
An apparatus for processing hollow bodies filled 
with metallic Na, comprising: a hermetically sealed housing
