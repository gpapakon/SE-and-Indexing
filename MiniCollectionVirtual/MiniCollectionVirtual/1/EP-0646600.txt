<ABSTRACT>
A novel cell growth-inhibiting protein is provided. 
The cell growth-inhibiting protein, obtainable from extract 

of human uterine endometrial carcinoma, has the amino acid 
sequence rich in hydrophobic residue at its N-terminal, 

has a molecular weight of about 68,000 dalton, and is 
considered to act as a paracrine growth-inhibiting factor 

in an organism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cell growth-inhibiting
protein, which inhibits the growth of human uterine
endometrial fibroblast, and thus is effective as a
medicament for inhibiting tumor growth and metastases.It is known that many types of tumor cells produce
substances that directly or indirectly promote their own
growth. It is known that some types of tumor cells produce
substances that directly or indirectly inhibit their own
growth (Iversen O.H., Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 57: 413-52).For example, tumor cells secrete proteinous growth
factors into their condition medium when grown in a cell
culture (James R., Bradshaw R.A., Annu. Rev. Biochem.,
1984; 53: 259-92, Rozengurt E., Science 1986; 234: 161-66,
Sporn M.B., Roberts A.B., Nature 1985; 313: 745-47,
Bradshaw R.A., Sporn M.B., Fed. Proc. 1983; 42: 2590-91).
These tumor cells or co-cultured fibroblasts often express
receptors for secreted protenious growth factors (Sporn
M.B., Roberts A.B., Nature 1985; 313: 745-47). Many types
of these factors including type α and β transforming
growth factors (TGF-α and β), platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), and bombesin have been known to lead
eventually to a mitogenic response of cells.TGF-β has already been purified to high homogeneity.
This factor can sometimes act negatively on the growth of
neoplastic cells of either fibroblastic or epithelial cells
(Tucker R.F., Shipley G.D., Moses H.L., Holly R.W., Science
1984; 226: 705-07, Tucker R.F., Braum E.L., Shipley G.D.,
Ryan R.J., Moses H.L., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1984;
81: 6757-61). However, the set of conditions in a cell
determining whether the action of TGF-β is positive or
negative for the growth is complex and cannot be explained
simply by differences in cell types, growth conditions or
the concentrations of TGF-β. In addition, it has been
suggested that uterine cervical and endometrial carcinomas
also synthesize and secrete a putative proteinous growth 
factor(s) for endometrial fibroblasts (Imai A., Matsunami
K., Tamaya T., Obstet. Gynecol. Invest., 1992; 33: 109-13,
Imai A., Matsunami K., Iida K., Tamaya T., Biosci. Rep.
1990; 10: 47-53). These growth factors may exhibit their
effects by a paracrine or autocrine mechanism, i.e. they
may be produced and released in the immediate vicinity of
their sites of action.Such growth promoting or inhibiting substances
derived from tumor cells are expected to be useful as
pharmaceutical agents, and various studies have been
conducted to discover substances capable of effecting
cell growth from tumor cells.An
