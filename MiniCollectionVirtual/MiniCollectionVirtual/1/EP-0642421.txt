<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for improving the capability of a surface (14) of an organic structure (16) to bond with another material includes irradiating a target area of the surface of a structure with pulsed, incoherent optical energy (18) from an optical energy source (12) having wavelength components which range from 170-5000 nanometers at an intensity sufficient to photodecompose any adventitious organic substances on the surface and to photodecompose a thin layer of molecular bonds forming the surface of the structure; and exposing the target area of the surface (14) to an ionized gas stream (24) from an ionized gas generator (26) that chemically reacts with the target area of the surface to increase the surface free energy of the surface. A similar method may also be employed to improve the bondability of a metal surface by impinging a target area on a metal surface with a stream of particles (36) to preclean and dislodge any inorganic substances from the surface; and then irradiating the target area of the surface with pulsed, incoherent optical energy (18) having wavelength components in the range of 170-5000 nanometers at an intensity sufficient to photodecompose any remaining organic substances present on the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR USING PULSED OPTICAL ENERGY TO INCREASE THE BONDABILITY OF A SURFACEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to optical surface preparation techniques, and more particularly, to improving the capability of the surface of a structure to bond with a material by irradiating the surface with incoherent, pulsed optical energy having a broadband energy spectrum.There are many applications for which it is desirable to bond one material to another. In the aircraft industry, for example, the exterior surface of airplanes must be painted to prevent corrosion that could otherwise weaken the airplane structure. In the automotive industry, metal subpanels must be bonded to polymeric outer body panels. Good bond strength between materials depends to a large extent on appropriate surface preparation. Surface preparation techniques which enhance the capability of the surface of a structure to bond with a material (bondability) include solvent cleaning, abrading, and/or chemical treatment. However, these methods are all characterized by potential toxic chemical hazards, waste disposal problems, and high production costs.All surface preparation techniques generally increase the surface free energy of the surface. Surface free energy refers to the energy required to create a unit area of the surface. In the case of a liquid, the surface free energy is expressed by the surface tension coefficient. Polar liquids, such as water, have high surface tension coefficients (H20 = 73 dynes/cm at 20Â°C) . For a liquid to wet a solid surface, the surface free energy of the solid surface must therefore be higher tha that of the liquid. As a result, the ability to achieve a water break free surface (i.e., no beading) is often used as a criteria for adequate surface preparation. 

 Surface free energy of a solid surface can be improved by either removing all surface contaminants or by changing the surface chemistry. Removing all surface contaminants improves the surface free energy because, when exposed to the environment, a solid with inherently high surface free energy will attract contaminants as a way to reduce its total energy. As a result, the contaminated surface loses or reduces its ability to bond to other surfaces. Removal of the surface contaminants (which are typically organic materials) will restore the surface's inherent surface free energy. For example, metals such as aluminum can achieve a "water break free" condition when the surfaces are clean.Removing surface contaminants does not always
