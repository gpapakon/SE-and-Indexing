<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel process for the
manufacture of a coated foodstuff comprising a
substantially uncooked foodstuff portion enrobed in a heat-set
batter whereby the batter is set by exposing the coated
foodstuff to targeted dielectric heat.Many conventional food products are prepared and sold in
the form of foodstuff portions that are coated with batter
or with a layer of batter that is itself coated with
breadcrumbs or a granular composition resembling
breadcrumbs. Conventionally the former are known as
"battered" foodstuffs and the latter as "breaded"
foodstuffs. Generally, such coated foodstuffs are marketed
in a substantially uncooked state and the consumer prepares
them for consumption by, for example, deep or shallow
frying.Traditionally it has been found necessary to heat-set the
batter in the coating after it has been applied to the
foodstuff. Heat-setting imparts to the coated foodstuff
sufficient cohesion and robustness for the coated foodstuff
to be handled during subsequent operations, such as
packaging, prior to deep freezing and ensures that the
batter remains stable and cohesive if the coated foodstuff
subsequently thaws.Conventionally, heat-setting of the batter is performed by
frying the coated foodstuff briefly in hot oil. For
example, in a conventional process for producing fish
fingers, individual fish sticks (prepared by sawing a block
of frozen fish) are battered and breaded, and then fried at 
180Â°C for 30 to 40 seconds, before being packed and re-frozen.Heat-setting of the batter by frying has several inherent
disadvantages. Oil is absorbed during frying and this
tends to produce an unnecessarily high level of oil (6 -
7%) in the coated foodstuff. Moreover, it is often
necessary to discard some or all of the oil because it
undergoes thermal degradation. Hence, frying is expensive
because the high grade oil must be replenished
continuously.It is thus desirable to be able to find novel processes for
selectively heating the outer surface of food products in
order to be able to heat-set coatings.EP-A-0289862 discloses a process for setting a coating on
a coated food portion using heated air and steam. The food
portion may be cooked all the way through, or the coating
may be set whilst the food portion is not significantly
cooked. The heating operation may include subjecting the
food portion to microwaves.An article in the Journal of Microwave Power, vol 18, No.
4, p.345-353, 1983, discusses the effects of microwave
cooking on the textural characteristics of battered and

<CLAIMS>
A process for the manufacture of a coated foodstuff
comprising a substantially uncooked foodstuff portion

enrobed in a heat-set batter, which process comprises
applying a heat-settable batter to a portion of the

foodstuff and exposing the coated foodstuff to targeted dielectric
heat, wherein the penetration of the dielectric heat is

restricted to the foodstuff coating and the foodstuff is
exposed to the dielectric heat for a period of time that is

sufficient to set the batter but insufficient to cause any
significant cooking or overheating of the foodstuff.
A process according to claim 1 wherein the frequency
of the targeted dielectric heat is from 0.8 to 10 GHz.
A process according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
frequency of the targeted dielectric heat is from 0.8 to 5

GHz.
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the
frequency of the dielectric heat used is within a

designated Industrial, Scientific and Medical band.
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the
dielectric heat is targeted onto the surface of the

foodstuff by a fringing field applicator.
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the
process additionally includes applying oil to the surface

of the coated foodstuff either before or after setting the
batter using dielectric heat.
A process according to claim 6 wherein from 0.1 to 4%
by weight of the foodstuff oil is applied. 
A process according to claim 6 or 7 wherein the oil is
applied to the foodstuff, via spraying. 
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the
foodstuff portion is selected from the group consisting of

fish, poultry, red meat, vegetables and mixtures thereof.
A process according to any preceding claim wherein the
portion of the foodstuff is coated with heat-settable

batter and is then breaded prior to being exposed to
dielectric heat.
