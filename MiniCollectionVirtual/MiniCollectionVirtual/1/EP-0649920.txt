<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a continuous process for manufacturing monofilaments having a diameter of 60  mu m to 500  mu m from fibre-forming polymers by melt-spinning the polymer, optionally quenching the filaments with a cooling medium below the melt-spinning head, cooling the filaments in a liquid bath having a temperature from -10 DEG C to 150 DEG C, removing the entrained water and aftertreating the filaments by spin-finishing, drawing and setting at a post-setting exit speed of the filaments of greater than 600 to 4000 m/min.

<CLAIMS>
Continuous process for the simultaneous production of
a multiplicity of monofilaments having a diameter of

60 µm to 500 µm from filament-forming polymers by
melt-spinning of the polymer, quenching of the

filaments (17) in a liquid bath (3), deflection of the
filaments in the liquid bath (3) at a filament guide

(4), stripping and centrifuging of the entrained
liquid at the outlet of the liquid bath, removal by

suction of the residual entrained liquid, drawing in
one or more stages in hot air, hot water or steam or a

combination of these media, fixing of the drawn
filaments in hot air and/or steam and finally winding

of the filaments, wherein the delivery speed of the
filaments after the fixing step is from 600 to

4000 m/min, characterised in that the polymer
filaments formed are for cooling blown on below the

melt spinning head with a cooling medium, that the
cooling is undertaken in the cooling bath with a

temperature of the cooling liquid of -10 to 150 °C and
that the individual filaments are run separately in

the cooling bath on a comb-type filament guide (16).
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the delivery speed of the filaments is from 1000 to

3500 m/min.
Process according to claims 1 and 2, characterised in
that the filaments have a final diameter of 100 to

300 µm.
Process according to claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the filaments have a final diameter of 180 to

250 µm. 
Process according to claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that polyamides are used as filament-forming polymers.
Process according to claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the filaments formed are blown on laterally with

air having a temperature of 0 to 50 °C over an area
from 1 to 10 cm in length below the spinning head (1).
Process according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that the temperature of the cooling bath (3) is from

10 to 40°C.
Process according to claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that in order to steady the liquid flow in the cooling

bath (3) use is made of baffles (6, 6'), of which the
baffles (6') situated above the filament sheaf can be

folded away upwards when the process is in operation.
Process according to claims 1 to 8, characterised in
that the filaments are subjected to drawing of 200 to

700% in hot air with a temperature of 150 to 350°C, hot
water with a temperature of 85 to 98°C or steam with a

temperature of 100 to 150°C or any sequential
combination of said media and are then fixed in hot

air having a temperature of 150 to 350°C and/or steam
having a temperature of 100 to 150°C.
Process according to claims 1 to 9, characterised in
that the fluid flow caused by the drag flow of the

filaments is steadied by means of comb-type baffles
(6, 6').
Process according to claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that a preparation is applied to the filaments prior

to the drawing. 
Apparatus for carrying out the process according to
claims 1 to 11, consisting of a melt-spinning head

with spinneret (1), a liquid bath (3) with a filament
guide (4) and baffles (6, 6'), strippers (7), at least

one deflecting roll (8) or notched mangle bowl for the
centrifuging of entrained cooling liquid, an adhering

liquid suction means (9, 11) upstream and optionally
downstream of a subsequent spin finish point (10), one

or more drawing apparatuses (12) for the hot drawing,
a fixing zone (13) and winding points (15),

characterised in that the filament guide (4) is a
comb-type filament guide with separate guiding (16) of

the individual filaments (17), that a blow nozzle (2)
for cooling the filaments is disposed between the

spinneret (1) and the liquid bath (3), and that a
post-spin finish point is provided at each winding

point (15), wherein the winding speed of the winding
points (15) is from 600 m/min to 4000 m/min.
Apparatus according to claim 12, characterised in that
the filament guide (4) c
onsists of rod-shaped guide
elements (4') arranged in a semi-circle and having

combs (16) which guide the filaments (17) individually
on the guide elements.
