<ABSTRACT>
A filter flow indicator for use with a filter bag (22) into which contaminated aquarium water is pumped which comprises a meter tube (80) connected to an inlet tube (68) by a coupling tube (82). Water flowing in the inlet tube (68) flows across the coupling tube (82). The rate of flow in the inlet tube (68) is related to the amount of clogging in the filter bag (22). A mark (90) is included on the meter tube (80) as to when the filter bag (22) should be replaced. As the filter bag (22) clogs, the flow rate in the inlet (68) slows down causing the water level (64) in the meter tube (80) to increase. When water in the meter tube (80) reaches the mark (90), the filter bag (22) is sufficiently clogged so that it should be replaced.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FILTER FLOW INDICATORBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a filter flow indicator for an aquarium filter, and more particularly to a flow indicator for an aerobic aquarium filter which indicates when the filter bag needs replacement.Whenever aquatic animals are to be maintained within an aquarium environment, the quality of the water in which they live must be maintained at a suitable level. In addition to properly controlling the temperature, the toxic material content of the water must be maintained at a sufficiently low level to prevent harm to the aquatic animals, which are primarily fish.To combat the problem of toxic waste build-up, three types of filtration are used. The first is physical filtration wherein a water permeable membrane structure traps suspended waste material as contaminated water passes through the membrane. The second is chemical filtration which generally uses activated carbon and ion exchange resins to deactivate mostly organic waste. The third is biological filtration which is accomplished by means of 

living organisms such as bacteria which, among other thing, rid the aquarium of ammonia.One example of a highly effective filter which provides physical, chemical and aerobic filtration is described in U.S. Patent 4,622,148 assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The filter is in the form of an enclosed filter bag, pouch or receptacle into which a continuous supply of contaminated water flows.The filter bag has walls which are made at least partially of a porous filter membrane. The bag is open at one end into which contaminated water is pumped. The contaminated water which flows into the bag exits through the porous walls of the bag. As the filter walls clog with contaminants, the flow of water through the walls will eventually slow down and stop.The filter bag shown in the patent is constructed so that as the contaminants clog the filter walls, the fibrous material expands to permit the water flow to continue through the walls. The expanding action provides a longer lasting aerobic filter, but ultimately, the filter will clog and will substantially reduce any flow of water therethrough.When using a filter bag in which the water passes transversely through the filter, when the filter clogs the water will flow over the filter indicating a clogged bag. 

However, with an aerobic filter as described wherein the water flows into the bag and then outward through the walls, it is not readily visible when the flow rate is reduced. If one neglects to

<CLAIMS>
What is Claimed is;
1. A filter flow indicator in combination with an aquarium tank including means containing an aquarium filter medium for filtering aquarium water, the indicator comprising: an inlet tube having an entry opening immersible in the aquarium water for accepting aquarium water, and an outlet opening for delivering water to the filter medium; a meter tube running substantially parallel to the inlet tube; and a connection tube between the inlet tube and the meter tube across which water flowing through the inlet tube can transversely pass to control water level in the meter tube, said meter tube including indication means thereon for indicating that the filter medium is clogged and should be replaced when said level reaches said indication means.
2. A filter flow indicator according to claim 1, wherein: said filter medium is in the shape of a filter bag which has an opening which receives water discharged from said outlet opening of the inlet tube. 


 3. A filter flow indicator according to claim 1, wherein said meter tube has an open upper end, said tube being of sufficient height to have said upper end extend above the level of water in the aquarium tank.
4. A filter flow indicator according to claim 1, wherein said meter tube has a closed lower end and wherein said connection tube couples to said meter tube between said upper and lower ends.
5. A filter flow indicator according to claim 3, wherein said connection tube couples to said meter tube at a lower end thereof.
6. A filter flow indicator according to claim 1, which further comprises: a flow valve which can vary the rate of flow in the inlet tube; said indication means on the meter tube being adapted to indicate a clogged filter condition at various rates of flow.
7. A filter flow indicator according to claim 1, and further comprising flow directional means for directing substantially all of the accepted aquarium water directly into the filter medium. 

8. A filter flow indicator according to claim 2, and further comprising: means for pumping contaminated water from the aquarium tank through the inlet tube into said filter bag.
9. An aquarium filter comprising an inlet compartment arranged for receiving contaminated water from an aquarium tank and a filtering compartment retaining a filter bag; an inlet tube having one end thereof in communication with the contaminated water in the aquarium tank and the other end thereof in communication with said inlet compartment; means for pumping contaminated water from the aquarium tank through the inlet tube wherein said water can then flow to said filtering compartment for filtration by said filter bag; means for discharging the filtered water from the filtering compartment back into the aquarium tank; a meter tube positioned adjacent to and substantially parallel to at least a portion of said inlet tube, a portion of said meter tube being insertable into the aquarium tank; and coupling tube means between said inlet tube and said meter tube, the tubes being arranged such that as the aquarium water passes through said inlet tube it 


 traverses across an opening of said coupling tube means thereby controlling the height of water level in said meter tube; said meter tube including indication means thereon for indicating that the filter bag is clogged and should be replaced when the height of the water level reaches said indication means.
10. An aquarium filter as in claim 9, wherein said coupling tube means connects said inlet tube and said meter tube along portions thereof which are disposed below the water level of the aquarium tank water.
