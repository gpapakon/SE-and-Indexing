<ABSTRACT>
Zwei numerisch gesteuerte Vorschubvorrichtungen kommen 
nacheinander zum Einsatz, wobei die zweite von der ersten 

Vorschuborrichtung übernimmt, wenn bereits zwei oder mehr 
Stanzschritte erfolgt sind. Der erste Stanzschritt einer 

neuen Tafel wird mit der hinteren Reihe von Werkzeugen den 
Pressen gleichzeitig mit dem letzten Stanzschritt für die 

vorausgehende Tafel durch die vorderen Werkzeugreihen 
durchgeführt. Senso
ren (80,82,84,86) ermitteln Länge und/oder Winkligkeit 
der Tafelschnittkanten und ermöglichen die Errechnung 

von Korrekturdaten für den Vorschub der Tafeln und wodurch 
das An- und Ausstanzen an vorderen und hinteren Kanten 

vermieden wird.

A punch (10) having a plurality of tools (12, 14) including a plate positioning
and feeding system comprising:


a) a positioning station disposed upstream of the punch (10) and including
positioning means for positioning a plate (36) with respect to a pair of

orthogonal axes (74, 76, 78)
b) a first feed device (22) including first gripping means (24, 26) adapted to be
displaced by a first feed drive means (34) at least in the direction of the feed

axis (16) and arranged to grip a plate (36) in the positioning station (72) in a
rear position and to feed the plate towards the punch (10)
c) a second feed device (38) including gripping means (50, 52) adapted to be
displaced by a second feed drive means (44) along the feed axis (16) and

arranged to grip a plate in a rear position and to advance the plate towards
the punch,
d) the punch (10) including two rows of punching tools (12, 14), with the rows
being spaced in feed direction of the plates (18, 36, 60)
 
characterized by the following features:
e) the first feed device (22) is arranged to advance the plates to a transfer position
which is downstream of the positioning station (72)
f) the second feed device (38) is arranged to grip the plate in the transfer position
g) the transfer position is arranged to correspond to the position of the plates
(18, 36) during a punching stroke of the punch (10) after the punch (10) has

performed at least one preceding punching stroke on a plate
h) first and second feed devices (22, 38) co-operate so that the leading row of
punching tools (12) performs the last punching stroke with respect to a first

plate (18) at the same time when the trailing row of punching tools (14) performs
the first punching stroke with respect to the following plate (36).
i) second gripping means (50, 52) are arranged to laterally grip each plate (18)
from opposite sides at the trailing end thereof when the plate (18) is in the

transfer position.
The punch of claim 1, characterized in that a loading station (70) is provided
upstream of the positioning station (72), and a third feed device is provided to

advance the plate (60) into the positioning station (72). 
The punch of claim 2, characterized in that the third feed device includes a pair
of parallel conveyor means (62, 64) driven by separate numerically controlled

third drive means and each including a drive member (66, 68) which are
arranged such that one of the drive members is disposed upstream of a plate and

the other is disposed downstream of a plate (60).
The punch of claim 3, characterized in that the conveyor means (62) of the
leading one (68) of the drive members (66, 68) is controlled so that it engages

the leading edge of a plate (60) when the plate (60) is advanced toward the positioning
station (72).
The punch of claim 2, characterized in that the third feed device includes feed
rollers (94, 96, 114, 116, 130, 132) spaced along the feed direction, with the feed

rollers engaging a plate (60a, 36a) from upper and lower sides and are driven in
unison by a numerically controlled drive (98), the spacing of the feed rollers in

the feed direction being smaller than the length of a plate (60, 36a), and the
leading feed rollers (114, 116) being displaceable out of the feed path of the

plate (60a, 36a) and being coupled to an actuating device (128)
The punch of claim 5, characterized in that the lower of the leading feed rollers
(114, 116) are supported by arms (106, 108) which are pivotally mounted to a

frame (90) and are engaged by at least one actuating cylinder (128). 
The punch of one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that at least one pair of
sensors (80, 82, 84, 86) being spaced from each other transverse to the feed

direction for a predetermined amount and arranged to sense the leading and the
trailing edges of a plate (36) so as to provide corresponding signals, and a

numerical control for said first and said second drive means (34, 44) arranged to
determine an actual value of the plate length from said sensor signals and the

feed data of the respective feed device is stored in said numerical control and to
compare said actual value with a desired value stored in the numerical control

and to compute a correction value from the difference between the desired and
actual values, the correction value being used to correct the remaining feed of

the respective plate by the first drive means (34) and the feed of the plate by the
second drive means (44).
The punch of claim 7, characterized in that at least a pair of sensors (80, 82, 84,
86) is provided in spaced relationship to each other along a transverse axis which

extends perpendicularly with respect to the feed direction (16), which sensors are
arranged to sense the leading and trailing edges of the plate (36) in order to provide

signals to be used in the numerical control for determining any deviation of

the edges of the respective plate (36) from the transverse axis (angularity). 
The punch of claim 7 or 8, characterized in that the numerical control is arranged
to provide a stop signal when the difference between the desired and actual

values or the deviation of the plate edges from the transverse axis exceed a predetermined
value.
The punch of one of the claims 7 to 9, characterized in that the sensors (80, 82,
84, 86) comprise laser light sensors.
