<ABSTRACT>
In order, in the case of a ring screw, to permit alignment of the connection eyelet (2) in the direction of the forces introduced into it, the ring screw comprises two parts which are arranged rotatably with respect to one another and of which one forms the connection eyelet (2) and one forms an anchorage screw (3), the head (6) of which is supported, via a ring flange (62), on a supporting surface of the eyelet base (21) of the connection eyelet (2). At least one locking element (9) is used in order to secure the attachment of the connection eyelet (2) and the anchorage screw (3).

An eyebolt having a connecting eyelet serving the suspension
of a lifting or lashing means, and having a threaded

journal which serves to fasten it to an object and is supported
via a holding member against the bored-through eyelet

base and in which, via the holding member, a rotary motion
can be induced, characterized therein that the threaded journal

is part of an anchor bolt, the head of which fashions a
cylindrical segment and a thereto adjoined annular flange

forming the holding member, the cylindrical segment of the
head having a larger diameter than the threaded journal and

its end facing away from the annular flange, in the fitted
state of the eyebolt, forming a bearing surface protruding

over the underside of the connecting eyelet, which underside
extends perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the anchor

bolt.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 1, characterized therein
that the mutually touching faces of the annular flange of the

head of the anchor bolt and of the eyelet base are conically
configured.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
therein that the anchor bolt is configured as a hexagon

socket screw.
The eyebolt as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3,
characterized therein that the securement of the captiveness

of the anchor bolt in the bore of the eyelet base is served
by at least one locking element restricting the axial mobility

of the anchor bolt.
The eyebolt as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4,
characterized therein that the anchor bolt can be inserted, 

from that side of the eyelet base facing the connecting
eyelet, into the bore of said eyelet base.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized
therein that the locking element is formed by a projection of

the connecting eyelet, which projection forms a stop for the
head of the anchor bolt.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 4 or 5, characterized
therein that the locking el
ement is formed by a transition
member welded into the opening of the connecting eyelet.
The eyebolt as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 7,
characterized therein that to the connecting eyelet there is

connected a screwing tool which can be coupled to the head of
the anchor bolt and by means of which, by virtue of the connecting

eyelet, a screwing motion can be induced in the anchor
bolt.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 8, characterized therein
that the screwing tool comprises a bow, which serves to hold

it against the connecting eyelet, and a screwing part.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 9, characterized therein
that the screwing part is disposed in the region of the

crossbar of the bow.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 9 or 10, characterized
therein that the opening of the bow is narrower than the

smallest width of the cross section of the connecting eyelet.
The eyebolt as claimed in one or more of claims 9 to 11,
characterized therein that the screwing tool exhibits a bow

consisting of a bent wire segment.
The eyebolt as claimed in one or more of claims 9 to 11,
characterized therein that the screwing tool is configured as

a stamped part.
The eyebolt as claimed in one or more of claims 9 to 13,
characterized therein that the legs of the bow are deformable 

for the purpose of temporarily altering the size of the opening
of the bow.
The eyebolt as claimed in one or more of claims 8 to 14,
characterized therein that the screwing tool is configured as

a torque indicator.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 15, characterized
therein that the screwing tool exhibits two legs, which can

be elastically spread apart by amounts limited by a pair of
stops and the maximum spread setting of which corresponds to

that limit torque which allows the anchor bolt to be screwed
in.
The eyebolt as claimed in claim 16, characterized therein
that the stops of the pair of stops are of hook-shaped

configuration.
