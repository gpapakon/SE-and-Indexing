<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is relating to conveyor belts, the top layer of
which has been derived from hot melt compositions, based on
hydrogenated block copolymers from a vinyl aromatic and a
conjugated diene and more in particular styrene and butadiene
and/or isoprene respectively, to hot melt compositions to be used
and process for the manufacture of said conveyeor belts.Conveyor belts for a variety of applications are at present
almost exclusively manufactured of plasticized polyvinylchloride
(PVC) or polyurethanes (TPU) in combination with one or more
polyester (PET) or polyamide (PA) fabrics as support. Said belts
are primarily used in the food industry and the business/services
area.The manufacture of said belts has up to now been carried out
as a straightforward process in which PVC is applied to the base
fabric as a plastisol, whereas polyurethanes are applied as
powders.In both cases fusion is achieved at about 200 °C during a
short period in an oven, in general less than 1 minute, resulting
in a bonding of the produced polymer sheet to the fabric of more
than 2 N/mm and preferably of more than 3 N/mm as determined by a
T-peel test.However for reasons of required recyclability of these belts,
high dirt pick-up of certain types and restricted use at low
temperatures down to -40 °C, there has grown a strong need for
alternative materials.Therefore the primary object of the present invention is to
provide such alternative conveyor belts, which have to be
completely recyclable without any significant charge to environment 
due to production of toxic byproducts.More in particular, the primary object of the invention is to
provide such alternative conveyor belts, which are coated on only
one side of the fabric with an adequately bonded (i.e. > 2 N/mm)
polymer layer, other than the presently used objected ones, and
which, moreover, show a lateral stability i.e. a stability
perpendicular to the direction of transportation of goods.It will be appreciated that this aim could not be reached by
using e.g. EPDM or TPU containing compositions when using the
conventional application methods, such as extrusion/coating, or
reversed roll-coating.Moreover, it was generally known that for conventional
conveyor belts to be produced from a latex of SBR (random vinyl
aromatic/conjugated diene rubber) and fabric, the fabric threads
had preferably been precoated with e.g. a resorcine-formaldehyde
latex, in order to obtain sufficient adhesion.Moreover, it will be appreciated that such SBR or EPDM
comprising conveyor belts have to
