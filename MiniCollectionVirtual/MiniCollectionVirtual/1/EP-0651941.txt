<ABSTRACT>
In order to install or withdraw cheeses (2) deposited on a tray (1), there is used a support (21), such as a mat, provided with retractable components (23) passing through the grid (11) of the tray, which can pull back elastically towards the support when they come into contact, during a movement (F1) of the support parallel to the grid (11), with components (13) of the tray arranged transversely to the direction of movement. The invention applies especially to the turning over of cheeses, using a set (20) of two supports (21A, 21B) arranged opposite each other so as to maintain the cheeses between them, and capable of making a half-turn (F5) when the said component with the cheeses is released laterally from the tray.

A method for positioning cheese (2) on a tray (1) in the form of a grill (11) 
extending in a plane, or their removal from the tray, characterised in that the cheeses (2) 

are lifted by means of a horizontal flat support (21) equipped with a plurality of 
retractable elements (23) extending, in a raised position, perpendicularly or obliquely 

upwards relative to the support, the support being located at a level below that of the 
said grill (11) and the retractable elements extending to a level above the grill, and the 

support is moved in a parallel direction to the said plane, between a position in which 
the support is below the grill and a position where the support is beside the grill, the 

retractable elements (23) folding down temporarily towards the support when they are 
brought into contact with the grill during their displacement and regaining their raised 

position after the loss of contact, and the cheeses being permanently supported and 
carried along by the raised retractable elements. 
Application of the method according to claim 1 to the turning of cheeses, 
characterised in that a first support (21B) is used to withdraw the cheeses (2) from the 

tray (1), a second support (21A), in an inverted position relative to the first support and 
which can be positioned facing the first support, is used to be able to enclose the 

cheeses between the two supports when they are removed laterally from the tray, a half-turn 
is made of the assembly (20) consisting of the two supports (21A, 21B), and the 

cheeses are reinserted onto the tray by a movement of the second support in the 
direction opposite to the removal direction. 
Application of a method according to claim 2 to the turning of cheeses arranged 
on stacked trays, characterised in that a group (31) of sets (20) of supports (21A, 21B) 

one above the other is used and for the turning process a half-turn is made of the group 
(31), the set (20A) of upper supports then being in the lower position and conversely.  

 
A device for the placing and/or the removal of cheeses (2) on a tray (1) in the 
form of a grill (11) extending in a plane, comprising means (21) to support cheeses on 

passing through the gaps in the said grill, characterised in that the said means comprise 
a flat support (22) equipped with a plurality of retractable elements (23) extending in a 

raised position, into which they are returned resiliently, perpendicularly or obliquely 
relative to the support, the said retractable elements (23) being able to fold down (23') 

towards the support when they are brought, during a movement of the supports parallel 
to the grill, into contact with elements (13) of the latter extending transversely to the 

direction (F1) of the movement. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the retractable elements are 
hairs (23) of a mat (21) constituting the said support. 
A device according to claim 4 or claim 5, characterised in that the retractable 
elements are rigidly fixed to the support (22) and are themselves flexible. 
A device according to claim 4, characterised in that the retractable elements 
(23'') are articulated on the support (22) and are brought back resiliently into their 

extended position. 
A device according to any one of claims 4 to 7, characterised in that the 
retractable elements are made of Teflon. 
A machine for turning cheeses (2) arranged on trays (1), characterised in that it 
comprises at least one set (20) of two supports (21A, 21B) in accordance with one of 

claims 4 to 8, disposed in opposite directions to one another, means (45) to bring the 
retractable elements of the supports in contact with the cheeses and to lift the cheeses 

from the tray, means (46) for moving the supports parallel to the tray between an 
engaged  

 
position in which the supports are facing the tray and a disengaged position in which the 

supports are at the side of the tray, and means (47, 48) for turning the said set through a 
half-turn in the said disengaged position. 
A machine according to claim 9, characterised in that it comprises a group (31) of 
sets (20) above one another and means (47, 48) for turning the said group through a 

half-turn. 
A machine according to claim 10, characterised in that it comprises means (42) 
for moving the stacked trays apart and for bringing them closer together. 
A machine according to claim 9, characterised in that the retractable elements 
(23'') of the two supports (21A, 21B) of a set (20) are orientated obliquely in the opposite 

direction to the direction of movement of the supports parallel to the plane of the grills. 
A machine according to any one of claims 9 to 12, characterised in that the 
supports (22) comprise retractable elements on their two faces, the elements of one 

face supporting the cheeses on one tray and the elements of the other face serving to 
bear against the cheeses on the adjacent lower tray.
