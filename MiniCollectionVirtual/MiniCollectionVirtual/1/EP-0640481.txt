<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to liquid droplet ejection systems and,
more particularly, ink jet system and, even more particularly, to drop-on-demand
ink jet systems.Ink jet systems generally fall into two categories -- continuous
systems and drop-on-demand systems. Continuous ink jet systems operate
by continuously ejecting droplets of ink, some of which are deflected by
some suitable means prior to reaching the substrate being imprinted,
allowing the undeflected drops to form the desired imprinting pattern. In
drop-on-demand systems, drops are produced only when and where needed
to help form the desired image on the substrate.Drop-on-demand ink jet systems can, in turn, be divided into two
major categories on the basis of the type of ink driver used. Most systems
in use today are of the thermal bubble type wherein the ejection of ink
droplets is effected through the boiling of the ink. Other drop-on-demand
ink jet systems use piezoelectric crystals which change their planar
dimensions in response to an applied voltage and thereby cause the ejection
of a drop of ink from an adjoining ink chamber.Typically, a piezoelectric crystal is bonded to a thin diaphragm
which bounds a small chamber or cavity full of ink or the piezoelectric
crystal directly forms the cavity walls. Ink is fed to the chamber through
an inlet opening and leaves the chamber through an outlet, typically a
nozzle. When a voltage is applied to the piezoelectric crystal, the crystal
attempts to change its planar dimensions and, because the crystal is
securely connected to the diaphragm, the result is the bending of the
diaphragm into the chamber. The bending of the diaphragm effectively
reduces the volume of the chamber and causes ink to flow out of the
chamber through both the inlet opening and the outlet nozzle. The fluid
impedances of the inlet and outlet openings are such that a suitable amount 
of ink exits the outlet nozzle during the bending of the diaphragm. When
the diaphragm returns to its rest position ink is drawn into the chamber so
as to refill it so that it is ready to eject the next drop.Thermal bubble systems, although highly desirable for a variety of
applications, suffer from a number of disadvantages relative to piezoelectric
crystal systems. For example, the useful life of a thermal bubble system
print head is considerably shortened, primarily because of the stresses
which are imposed on the resistor protecting layer by the collapsing of
bubbles. In addition, because of the inherent nature of the boiling process,
it
