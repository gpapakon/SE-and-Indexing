<ABSTRACT>
The disclosed article comprises a semiconductor laser (typically a 
multi-segment DBR laser) and feedback means for controlling the laser wavelength. 

The wavelength reference element in the feedback means advantageously is an 
optical fiber comprising an in-line refractive index grating (21). Such gratings 

frequently have a transmission spectrum that exhibits subsidiary lobes, in addition to 
the desired main lobe, potentially compromising the "cold-start" ability of prior art 

systems. This and other drawbacks of prior art systems exemplarily are overcome 
by apparatus that comprises a feedback loop that comprises means for causing a 

current I
B
 to flow to the "Bragg" section of a multi-segment DBR laser such that the 
wavelength of the laser output (11) is a function of I
B
, and that further comprises 
means (25, 17, 16) for changing the temperature of the laser in response to a change 

in the wavelength of the laser. Use of a wavelength reference element that has a 
relatively wide primary minimum facilitates cold starting. Exemplarily, the 

disclosed article is a wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical fiber 
communication system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to articles (e.g., wavelength division multiplexed 
optical fiber communication systems) that comprise a wavelength-stabilized laser 
radiation source. Wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical fiber communication 
systems are known. Such a system typically comprises wavelength reference means 
and feedback means that maintain the wavelength of the output radiation of a laser at 
a predetermined value. Exemplarily, reference means comprise optical fiber with in-line 
refractive index grating. See, for instance, U.S. patent 5,077,816, which discloses a 
wavelength multiplexed fiber communication system that comprises a narrow band 
(e.g., 60 GHz tuning range) semiconductor laser and a narrow band (e.g., 44 GHz) 
refractive index reflection grating, with the feedback loop locking the laser output to 
the center frequency of the grating. See also C. R. Giles et al., IEEEPhotonics 
TechnologyLetters, Vol. 2(1), p. 63, which discloses use of an Er-YAG optical 
filter, and use of a feedback loop to control the current to the Bragg section of a 
two-section DBR laser. Some shortcomings are associated with prior art wavelength 
stabilization schemes. The scheme of the '816 patent involves use of a narrow band 
laser. However, it would frequently be desirable to be able to use lasers having a 
broad tuning range such that nominally identical (broad band) lasers could be used as 
sources in a WDM system, thus avoiding the need to use specially designed lasers 
for the various channels. The Giles et al. scheme typically does not provide access 
to all wavelengths within the tuning range of a (broad-band) laser. Such access 
typically would be desirable. The scheme of the '816 patent typically is not capable 
of start-up without human intervention ("cold-start") if the wavelength reference 
means (typically an in-line refractive index grating) does not have a single 
transmission minimum but exhibits also one or more subsidiary minima, as is 
frequently the case. It would clearly be desirable to have available a stabilization 
scheme that is capable of cold-start even under those circumstances. Finally, it 
would be desirable to have available a stabilization scheme that facilitates some 
choice in the control frequency, such that (typically unavoidable) small deviations 
from the target wavelength of the wavelength reference means can be readily  
 
compensated for. This application discloses an article that comprises a laser 
stabilization scheme that mitigates or eliminates at least
