<ABSTRACT>
A vibration reducer for a diaphragm coupling 
capable of suppressing axial vibrations as well as torsional 

vibrations is disclosed. In an improved construction, a 
diaphragm pack 3 is mounted between a diaphragm mount flange 

2 provided on an intermediate shaft 1 serving as a drive 
shaft and a shaft flange 4 of another shaft serving as a 

driven shaft. As pressure contact means, an elastic arm 5 
extending through the diaphragm pack 3 is mounted to the 

diaphragm mount flange 2. The elastic arm 5 is a 

cylindrical member, whose circumferential portion is severed 
by slits formed by wire-cutting. Free ends 5a of the 

elastic arm 5 are expanded in the radial directions by 
centrifugal forces caused by rotation of the shafts and come 

into pressure-contact with the liner member 8 formed 
integrally within a cylindrical portion 7 of the shaft 

flange 4. Thereby, a part of a torque is transmitted via 
the pressure-contact portion, hence a rigidity in the axial 

direction of the elastic arm 5 is added to that of the 
diaphragm pack 3 to suppress vibrations. In addition, an 

alternative construction of the pressure-contact means is 
disclosed, wherein a large pressure-contact force caused by 

centrifugal forces can be realized by making use of 
centrifugal weights 22, a centrifugal weight holder 23, an 

elongated bolt 24 and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vibration
reducer for a diaphragm coupling which is applicable to
an output shaft system of a marine gas turbine.Diaphragm couplings have been used in shaft
systems of various rotary machines including an output shaft
system of a marine gas turbine, as a flexible shaft coupling
for absorbing misalignment between axes.One example of a diaphragm coupling in the prior
art is shown in Fig. 17, and brief description will be made
on the structure of the diaphragm coupling in the following.
Diaphragm packs 3 are connected respectively to the opposite
ends of an intermediate shaft 1 (In Fig. 17, only one end
portion of the intermediate shaft 1 is illustrated.). To
each diaphragm pack 3 is connected a shaft flange on a drive
shaft side or a shaft flange 4 on a driven shaft side. In
the case of a marine gas turbine, the shaft flange on the
drive shaft side is connected to an output shaft of the gas
turbine, and the shaft flange 4 on the driven shaft side is
connected to a reduction gear.In the case of a marine gas turbine, misalignment 
between axes and displacement in the axial direction would
occur in a propeller shaft system due to oscillation of a
hull caused by wave forces, but these are absorbed by a long
intermediate shaft 1 and a pair of diaphragm packs 3. More
particularly, the construction is such that the shaft system
may be protected from respective external forces by tilting
of the intermediate shaft 1 upon misalignment between axes
and by elastic deformation of the diaphragm pack 3 upon
displacement in the axial direction.The diaphragm coupling composed of a pair of
diaphragm packs and an intermediate shaft would vibrate in
the axial direction at the time of operation. The natural
frequency of the diaphragm coupling is high as a rigidity of
the diaphragm pack is large. However, in the case where the
rigidity is large, the capability as a flexible coupling is
lowered, and an unreasonable vibration strain occurs in the
shaft system. Therefore, the diaphragm coupling is designed
in such banner that its natural frequency may be held lower
than a normal number of revolution, but when it is used in
a wide range of numbers of revolution as is often the case
with a marine turbine. Due to resonance at this time, not
only the diaphragm pack would damage or an inconvenience
would occur such that the operation may be stopped because
of an alarm of detecting large vibrations, in some cases
there was a fear that bearings may be damaged.
