<ABSTRACT>
A glass or plastic vial has a head 3 to which a 
closure (not shown) is to be attached; the head comprising 

a plinth portion 4 having a first diameter D1 and on the 
outside of which a multi-start screw thread 5 is provided. 

A neck 2 is formed immediately adjacent the head and has a 
second diameter D2 less than the first diameter. A 

shoulder 6 is formed at the junction between the head 3 
and the neck 2, and the threads 7 of the multi-start screw 

thread terminate at the shoulder and form a part of it. 
The vial can be closed by either a screw cap or a crimp 

cap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to glass or plastic vials 
or bottles and has particular application to vials such as 
may be used in chromatography. Chromatography vials are generally closed by a 
plastic screw cap or by an aluminium crimped cap and are 
constructed to be closed by one or other of such caps. 
In the first case a single-start screw thread is provided 
on the neck of the vial and in the second case the neck of 
the vial is provided with an enlarged head portion to 
which a crimp cap can be fitted by means of a special 
crimping tool. Both types of cap may employ a seal made 
of e.g. rubber, silicone, or PTFE and may have an aperture 
for the passage of a sampling needle through the seal. The present invention sets out to provide a vial 
which can receive either a screw cap or a crimp cap. 
This is achieved by providing a screw thread on the head 
of a crimp-top vial. Accordingly the present invention provides a 
glass or plastic vial or bottle having an upper part 
formed with an upper cylindrical head immediately above a 
lower cylindrical reduced neck and adapted to be closed by 
a crimp cap fitted to the head, wherein the head is formed 
with an external screw thread so that the vial or bottle 
can be alternatively closed by a screw cap. In a preferred embodiment the upper cylindrical 
head comprises a plinth having a first diameter and on the 
outside of which the screw thread is formed and wherein 
the lower reduced neck is formed immediately adjacent the 
plinth and has a second diameter less than the first 
diameter; whereby a shoulder is formed at the junction 
between the head and the reduced neck and the thread or  
 
threads of the screw thread terminate at the shoulder and 
form part thereof. Preferably, the screw thread is a multi-start 
thread. This means that the ends of the threads 
terminating at the shoulder are equally spaced around the 
circumference of the neck to provide a relatively regular, 
albeit partly interrupted, shoulder perpendicular to the 
axis of the vial. If only a single start screw thread is 
used the effect is to cause the thread to form a part of 
the shoulder only at one position around the circumference 
of the vial, thus making the shoulder somewhat uneven. 
As a result, a successful seal is not so readily achieved 
by a crimp cap. This effect can be mitigated by making 
the thread very fine but for a glass or plastic vial, this 
is difficult. Also a single start thread may be damaged 
by crimping a cap onto it. As a result of the screw threads terminating

<CLAIMS>
A glass or plastic vial or bottle having an 
upper part formed with an upper cylindrical head 

immediately above a lower cylindrical reduced neck and 
adapted to be closed by a crimp cap fitted to the head, 

wherein the head is formed with an external screw thread 
so that the vial or bottle can be alternatively closed by 

a screw cap. 
A vial or bottle as claimed in Claim 1, wherein 
the upper cylindrical head comprises a plinth having a 

first diameter and on the outside of which the screw 
thread is formed and wherein the lower reduced neck is 

formed immediately adjacent the plinth and has a second 
diameter less than the first diameter; whereby a shoulder 

is formed at the junction between the head and the reduced 
neck and the thread or threads of the screw thread 

terminate at the shoulder and form part thereof. 
A vial or bottle as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 
2 wherein the screw thread is a multi-start screw thread. 
A vial of bottle as claimed in Claim 3 wherein 
the thread has three starts. 
A vial or bottle as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein the shoulder is inclined slightly upwardly 

outwardly to provide a frustoconical surface for a crimp 
cap and wherein the lower ends of the or each screw thread 

form part of the frustoconical surface. 
A vial or bottle as claimed in Claim 5 wherein 
the shoulder is inclined to the horizontal by an angle of 

up to 15Â°. 
A vial or bottle as claimed in any preceding 
claim wherein the thread on the head extends for 

substantially the entire axial length thereof. 
A method of making a glass or plastic vial or 
bottle comprising the steps of: 


(a) forming a pre-form having a cylindrical 
side wall, a bottom end wall and an open top; 
(b) heating the upper part of the pre-form; 
(c) forging the upper part of the pre-form 
whilst hot to form an upper cylindrical head immediately 

above a lower cylindrical reduced neck; and 
(d) rolling an external screw thread onto the 
head whilst hot.
