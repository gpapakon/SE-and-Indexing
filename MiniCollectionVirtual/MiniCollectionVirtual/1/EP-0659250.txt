<ABSTRACT>
A powershift two-speed gear box is designed as an epicyclic gear box (3). Both gear steps are hydraulically switchable by means of two friction clutches (9 and 10). For that purpose friction elements (outer and inner disks 13, 14 and 19, 20) are alternatively closed and open by the force exerted by plate springs (16, 22) or by hydraulic fluid. Means associated to one of the friction clutches (9 or 10) prevent the full force of the spring from acting on the friction elements when the gear is shifted down from a higher to a lower step. An accumulator (30) is preferably used to influence torque transmission during downshift. An essential advantage of the disclosed arrangement consists in the smoothness of the shifting operation during downshift, avoiding a hard shifting which is felt as particularly disagreeable.

Two-speed power shift planetary gearing (3), the speeds 
of which are alternately selected by means of 

hydraulically operable friction clutches (9, 10), 
friction elements (13, 14 and 19, 20) of the friction 

clutches (9, 10) being closed by spring force (16, 22) 
and opened by oil pressure, lines (18, 24), into which 

check valves (28) with parallel-connected throttles (29) 
are inserted, leading to pressure chambers (17, 23) of 

the friction clutches (9, 10), characterized in that 
connected to at least one of the lines (18) is a receiver 

(30) which, upon opening of the friction clutch (91), is 
filled with pressure medium and, upon closing of the 

friction clutch (9) is emptied via the throttle point 
(29) so that, after the lifting clearance of the friction 

elements (13, 14 or 19, 20) has been surmounted, there is 
not the full spring force (16 or 22) acting upon the 

friction elements (13, 14 or 19, 20). 
Gearing according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
piston (33) at the maximum transmissible torque of the 

friction clutch reaches an end position. 
Gearing according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the receiver (30) is associated with the friction 

clutch (9) which is opened when the higher speed is 
selected.
