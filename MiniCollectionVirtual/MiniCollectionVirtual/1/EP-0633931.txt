<DESCRIPTION>
The interferons (IFN) constitute a group of
secreted proteins which exhibit a wide range of
biological activities and are characterized by their
capacity to induce an antiviral state in vertebrate
cells (I. Gresser and M.G. Tovey Biochem Biophys. Acta
516:231, 1978). There are three antigenic classes of
IFN : alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma. IFNα and IFNβ
together are known as the type I interferon.Natural type I human interferon comprises 12 or
more closely related proteins encoded by distinct genes
with a high degree of structural homology (Weissmann
and Weber, Prog. Nucl. Acid. Res. Mol. Biol. 33:251,
1986).The human IFNα locus comprises two subfamilies.
The first subfamily consists of 14 non allelic genes
and 4 pseudogenes having at least 80% homology. The
second subfamily, αII or omega (ω), contains 5
pseudogenes and 1 functional gene which exhibits 70%
homology with the IFNα genes (Weissmann and Weber
1986).The subtypes of IFNα have different specific
activities but they possess the same biological
spectrum (Streuli et al. PNAS-USA 78:2848, 1981) and
have the same cellular receptor (Agnet M. et al. in
"Interferon 5" Ed. I. Gresser p. 1-22, Academic Press,
London 1983).The interferon β (IFNβ) is encoded by a single
gene which has approximately 50% homology with the IFNα
genes.The interferon α subtypes and interferon β bind to
the same receptor on the cell surface. The interferon gamma (IFN gamma) is also encoded
by a single copy, which has little homology with the
IFNα and IFNβ genes. The receptor for IFN gamma is
distinct from the receptor of the α and β interferons.For the purpose of the present invention the
receptor of a and β classes of IFN will be designated
IFN-R. This represents natural type I receptor. The
group of proteins forming natural interferon α will be
designated IFNα, and type I-IFN will represent both
natural IFNα, IFNω, and IFNβ.Despite the fact that interferon is a potent
antiviral agent, there is considerable evidence to
suggest, that many of the characteristic symptoms of
acute virus diseases such as upper respiratory tract
infections are caused by an overproduction of
interferon alpha. Furthermore, IFN alpha has been shown
to contribute to the pathogenesis of certain chronic
virus infections in experimental animals and the
available evidence suggests that this is also the case
for certain human chronic virus diseases such as those
due to measles virus.The interferons α are also potent immunoregulatory
molecules which stimulate polyclonal B-cell
activation, enhance NK cell
