<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a metal-air battery-powered 
electric vehicle of the type having a motor powered by a 

plurality of metal-air cells wherein air is continuously 
provided to the cells by a blower system energized from a 

power source, in combination with a collision-activated 
switch for disconnecting the air blower system from the 

power source, wherein upon activation of the switch the air 
in the cell is immediately depleted and the battery is 

rendered substantially inert in less than 5 seconds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal-air battery-powered 
electric vehicle. More particularly, the present invention relates to 
such a vehicle having a collision safety device incorporated 
therein. Various proposals have been made in the past for 
electric-powered vehicles. To date, for a number of 
reasons, electric vehicle systems have yet to become 
commercially viable for urban and highway applications. 
There have been proposals to employ zinc-air batteries for 
urban vehicle propulsion. An example is the publication 
"Improved Slurry Zinc-Air Systems as Batteries for Urban 
Vehicle Propulsion," by P.C. Foller, Journal of Applied 
Electrochemistry, Vol. 16, pp. 527-543 (1986). Metal-air battery structures are described in the 
following publications: U.S. Patent No. 4,842,962, entitled 
"Zinc Electrode and Rechargeable Zinc-Air Battery;" U.S. 
Patent No. 4,147,839, entitled "Electrochemical Cell with 
Stirred Slurry;" U.S. Patent No. 4,908,281, entitled 
"Metal-Air Battery with Recirculating Electrolyte;" U.S. 
Patent No. 3,847,671, entitled "Hydraulically-Refuelable 
Metal-Gas Depolarized Battery System;" U.S. Patent No. 
4,925,744, entitled "Primary Aluminum-Air Battery;" U.S. 
Patent No. 3,716,413, entitled "Rechargeable Electrochemical 
Power Supply;" U.S. Patent No. 4,925,744, entitled "Primary 
Aluminum-Air Battery." One of the characteristics of metal-air batteries such 
as zinc-air is that, unlike conventional batteries such as 
lead-acid and nickel cadmium, in which both the anodic and 
cathodic active materials must be stored within the plates 
of the cell, in metal-air only the anodic active material  
 
(the zinc in the case of zinc-air) is stored within the 
system. The cathodic reactant (oxygen from the air) is 
supplied from outside the battery from the surrounding air, 
either by natural diffusion in the case of small size, low 
power, single-cell units, or by forced flow (from, for 
example, a fan or blower) in the case of large size, high 
power, multi-cell assemblies. A typical example of the 
former category is a zinc-air button cell for a hearing aid, 
relying only on natural diffusion of air, and able to supply 
a current density only in the range of 1-10 mA/cm2. A 
typical example of the latter category is a zinc-air 
electric vehicle battery, comprising close stacking of 
perhaps as many as 400 cells, requiring an air blower, but 
capable of supplying continuous current density of the order 
of 100 mA/cm2 and peak current densities of 400 mA/cm2. Particularly for the
