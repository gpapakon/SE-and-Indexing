<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing the severity of toxoplasmosis resulting from infection of a patient with Toxoplasma gondii by administering to a patient in need of such treatment, either after infection or before exposure to infection, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that is a spiropiperidyl derivative of rifamycin S, wherein the derivative comprises an imidazole ring that includes carbons at positions 3 and 4 of the rifamycin ring, the carbon at position 2 of the imidazole ring also being a ring carbon at position 4 of a piperidine ring system, thereby forming a spiropiperidyl ring system, the spiropiperidyl ring system optionally comprising a lower hydrocarbon substituent on the nitrogen of the piperidine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 08/057,288, filed 
May 5, 1993. This invention relates to the field of disease treatment and prophylaxis. More 
particularly it relates to the treatment and prophylaxis of Toxoplasma gondii infections. Toxoplasmosis is caused by the parasitic protozoan, Toxoplasma gondii. In humans, 
the disease is traditionally associated with the developing fetus in whom it can cause severe 
neurological problems manifesting as hydrocephaly, mental retardation and/or blindness [1, 
2]. In healthy adults, the disease is typically mild, producing few if any symptoms. In 
immunocompromised adults, however, the parasite can cause severe or even fatal disease [3, 
4, 5]. The disease also occurs in other mammals and is a leading cause of spontaneous 
abortion in sheep. The parasite itself is extremely widespread and is typically acquired through the 
ingestion of undercooked meat in which tissue cysts containing the parasite may reside. This 
form is highly infectious if the meat is not well cooked. Alternatively, the parasite can be 
contracted through ingestion of foods contaminated with oocysts that are shed in the feces of 
infected cats. The oocyst is the product of the complete sexual cycle. The oocyst form is 
highly resistant to destruction by natural elements and can persist in the soil for more than one 
year after excretion by the cat. In the U.S.A., serological studies indicate that about 10-50% 
of the population has had contact with the parasite, the prevalence depending on the 
geographic locales and ethnic group [21]. In countries where eating lightly cooked or raw 
meat is more common, this figure can rise to as much as 85% (e.g., in France [7]). The 
incidence of disease in the developing fetus is, fortunately, not as high as these figures might 
at first suggest because it appears that the fetuses of women who are infected for a significant 
period of time prior to becoming pregnant are generally not at risk [21]. Diagnosis of congenital infection has in the past relied on serology (reviewed in 
[1,21]). This can be done postnatally or, ideally, pre-natally and relies on the relative titers of 
IgG and IgM (to deduce whether the titers are due to a current infection or legacy of a past  
 
infection). The factors contributing to the severity of disease in the developing fetus have 
been poorly understood. The only well-established factor is that the time of initial infection of 
the mother relative to conception is critical: infection
