<ABSTRACT>
A nose assembly (10) of a fastener driving tool is disclosed for 
facilitating the removal of any jammed fasteners (23), which become 

lodged in the nose assembly (10). The nose assembly (10) has a front 
(15) and 

back (14) plate pivotally connected to define therebetween a drive 
track (18). The back plate (14) is secured to a housing structure 

(11) adapted to 
drive a fastener (23a) from a drive track (18) into a workpiece. 

A magazine 
assembly (19) for storing a strip of the fasteners (23) is 

adapted to feed 
the leading fastener (23a) into the drive track (18). In its operative 

position, the leading fastener (23a) within the magazine assembly (19) 
is 

positioned in the drive track (18) abuting the front plate (15). 
To remove 

any jammed fastener, the front plate (15) is pivoted to an inoperative 
position to expose the jammed fastener in the drive track (18) 

for easy 
removal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fastener driving tool according to
the preamble of claims 1 and 10 resp., and, in
particular, to the improvement of its nose assembly to enable the
operator to quickly and easily remove a jammed fastener from a
drive track of the tool.Tools for rapidly driving fasteners such as pins, brads,
staples and the like are commonly used in the commercial work
place. All of these tools have standard components comprising a
housing, a driving element, a nose assembly defining a drive track
in which the driving element can travel rectilinearly, a power
driving mechanism mounted within the housing to impart a forward or
driving and a return stroke to the driving element, and a magazine
in which the fasteners are stored and fed sequentially one at a
time into the drive track.Although all tool designs are based on the premise that the
fastener aligns precisely in the drive track and each fastener in
turn is driven perfectly into the workpiece, it does not always
happen. Due to tolerances of both the fasteners and the tool
components, there are times when the fastener is not seated
properly in the drive track. If the misalignment is significant,
the fastener may become jammed in the drive track rather than enter
the workpiece.Another malfunction is caused by the workpiece being hard or 
difficult to penetrate. The leg or shank of the fastener has a
column strength defined by the material from which it is made.
Should the resistance to penetrate the workpiece become greater
than the strength of the fastener, then the leg may buckle and jam
in the drive track. Debris, woodchips or the like may also cause
a fastener to become jammed in its drive track and must be removed
before the tool will again operate correctly. US-A-3 957 192 discloses a fastener driving tool from which jammed
fasteners can be removed, according to the preamble of claim
1. The known fastener driving tool has a magazine from which the
fasteners are fed to a discharge chute. The wall of the discharge
chute opposite to the outlet of the magazine is movable
between two positions in one of which it allows fasteners to be
removed from the discharge chute. However, the known fastener
driving tool does not provide any means for securing said wall
in order to allow easy and safe access for removal of jammed
fasteners.Further, GB-A-2 205 776 describes a fastener driving tool according
to the preamble of claim 10: A pusher of the known fastener
driving tool advances the fasteners forward to a nosepiece assembly.
The nosepiece

Apparatus for driving fasteners (23) into a workpiece comprising;

(a) a housing structure (11);
(b) a back plate (14) secured to said housing structure;
(c) a front plate (15) cooperating with said back plate to define
therebetween a drive track (18);
(d) means (19) for guiding the fasteners to said drive track;
(e) means (24) for advancing the fasteners from said guiding means
to said drive track; and
(f) means (17) for pivotally mounting said front plate to said
back plate for movement along an arcuate path about an axis off

set to one side of said drive track between a closed position and
an open position, wherein access from the exterior of said housing

is given to the fasteners in said drive track;

   characterized by
(g) means (21) for latching said front plate in said closed
position and releasable for allowing said front plate to be

pivotally moved to said open position,

wherein said latching means comprises a manually graspable,
threaded screw (21) which is rotatable in a first direction to latch

said front plate in its closed position and is rotatable in a
second, opposite direction to release said front plate.
The apparatus for driving fasteners according to claim 1,
wherein said front plate (15) includes a flat surface (38) which in its

closed position is oriented towards said back plate (14) thus allowing
unrestricted pivotal movement of said front plate toward said open

position.
The apparatus for driving fasteners according to claims 1 or 2,
wherein there is further included a, fastener driving element (12)

adapted for rectilinear movement within said drive track (18), and
actuable means for initiating the reciprocal movement of said

fastener driving element. 
The apparatus for driving Fasteners according to one of claims 1-3,
wherein there is further included an element (13) having an end portion

(35) for contacting the workpiece, and means (43,44,45) for mounting said workpiece
contacting element on said front plate for rectilinear movement

with respect to said front plate between a first position wherein
said end portion extends beyond said front plate and is exposed for

contact with the workpiece and a second position wherein said
