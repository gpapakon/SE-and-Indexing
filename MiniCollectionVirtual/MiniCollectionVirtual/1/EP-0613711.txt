<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for the cleaning of gases, in 
particular air, with the aid of organic filtration material, 

in which the filtration material is placed upon a grating 
floor located inside a chamber (5) which is moveable and 

-after the filtration material has been charged in it- is 
lifted up and placed on top of an air supply room (1), such 

that a seal is obtained between the chamber (5) and the air 
supply room (1). After the filtration material has lost its 

activity, the chamber (5) can be lifted off the air supply 
room (1) and be replaced with a chamber (5) having new 

filtration material. The chamber (5) can be tilted for 
removing the filtration material from it, and can be provided 

with humidification tubes (14) and with tubing (15) for 
pre-heating the air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of cleaning gases, in 
particular air, with the aid of organic filtration material 
which is provided on a grating floor located inside a chamber 
formed by a number of substantially vertical walls, 
which chamber is positioned moveably on an air supply room, 
such that a seal is obtained between the walls of the chamber 
and the walls of the air supply room, while after the 
filtration material has lost its activity, the chamber 
having the filtration material (13) is removed and replaced 
with a chamber having new filtration material in it. Such a method is known from DE-U-9,115,389. In this 
known method the organic filtration material is deposited 
directly on to the grating floor. This entails that the 
filtration material will dry out and therefore be less 
active when the air to be cleaned is passed through it. The 
portions of the filtration material will also not adjoin 
well, so that at least part of the air shall be filtered 
less well. The invention has the purpose of removing this objection, 
and to that end it provides in that the grating floor is 
first provided with a layer of gravel, followed by the 
organic filtration material, and that during use of the 
apparatus the gravel is kept humid by spraying water on to 
it from nozzles provided close above the layer of gravel. The thickness of the layer of gravel shall, for example, 
be approximately 20 mm. To further counteract the drying-out of the filtration 
material, there can be provided that humidification of the 
filtration material occurs from several levels, in which one 
level lies above the filtration material, and the other is 
located at about half the height of the filtration material, 
from which level the gravel is humidified as well. Further, there is the possibility of pre-heating the 
air to be cleaned by passing it through tubing which is 
located either immediately above or also inside the filtration  
 
material itself. In this the heat released during the 
bio-activity in the filtration material is utilized. Such a method offers advantages in particular in the 
cleaning of air with a relatively low temperature by which 
the bacterial activity of the filtration material could be 
adversely affected. Air with a relatively low temperature is 
present in, for example, water-purification installations. The invention also relates to an apparatus for the 
application of the method described above, which apparatus 
is characterized in that substantially horizontally extending 
tubes, provided

Method of cleaning gases, in particular air, with the 
aid of organic filtration material (13) which is provided on 

a grating floor (9, 10) located inside a chamber (5) formed 
by a number of substantially vertical walls (6), which 

chamber is positioned moveably on an air supply room (1), 
such that a seal is obtained between the walls (6) of the 

chamber (5) and the walls of the air supply room (1), while 
after the filtration material (13) has lost its activity, 

the chamber (5) having the filtration material (13) is 
removed from the air supply room (1) and replaced with a 

chamber having new filtration material in it, characterized 
in that the grating floor is first provided with a layer of 

gravel (12), followed by the organic filtration material 
(13), and that during use of the apparatus the gravel is 

kept humid by spraying water on to it from nozzles provided 
close above the layer of gravel (12). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
humidification of the filtration material (13) occurs from 

several levels, in which one level lies above the filtration 
material, and the other is located at about half the height 

of the filtration material, from which level the gravel is 
humidified as well. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the air to be cleaned is pre-heated by passing it through 

tubing (15) which is located either immediately above, or 
also in the filtration material (13) itself. 
Apparatus for applying the method according to any 
preceding Claim, characterized in that substantially horizontally 

extending tubes (14), provided with nozzles, have 
been provided in the chamber (5), which pass through at 

least one vertical wall (6) of the chamber to the exterior 
for the connection of supply lines of spraying water to it. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
some similarly embodied chambers (5) can be stacked for 

filtrating the air to be cleaned in stages because the 
bottom edge of a chamber can not only be placed on top of 

the air supply room (1), but also on top of the top edge of 
a similar chamber (5), and that a roofing assembly (16), 

provided with means for lifting it and for the discharge of 
air from the chamber (5), can be placed on top of the top 

edge. 
Apparatus according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized in 
that a grating floor provided in a chamber (5) is formed by 

a number of bars (9), rods or the like which are either 
directly or indirectly connected to the walls (6) of the 

chamber (5) for forming a coarse grating, on top of which 
coarse grating a grating mat (10), consisting of cross-laid 

and interconnected plastic wires, is laid.
