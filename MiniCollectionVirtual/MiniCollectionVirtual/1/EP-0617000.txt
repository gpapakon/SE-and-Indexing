<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 4-fluorobiphenyl

to as HMG-CoA reductase) thereof, and which is also 
useful as an intermediate for producing the above-mentioned 
cholesterol lowering agent or lipid lowering 
agent: 
wherein A is a ω-oxycarbonyldihydroxybutyl group of 
formula (II):     wherein R⁴ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 
1 to 6 carbon atoms, which may have a substituent,
 
   an alkaline metal or an alkaline earth metal;
 
a tetrahydropyranyl group of formula (III): 
a ω-oxycarbonyl-3-oxobutyl group of formula (IV): 
   wherein R⁶ is an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms, which may have a substituent;
 
a formyl group; or
 
a cyano group,
 
R¹ is a halogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6, which 
may have a substituent, or a group represented by R⁵O-,
 
wherein R⁵ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to  
 
6 carbon atoms, which may have a substituent; R² is a 
hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,

compound which is capable of decreasing the concentration 
of cholesterol in the blood, which is considered to be a 
prominent factor for causing arteriosclerosis (refer to 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 50-155690). ML-236B 
inhibits the biosynthesis of cholesterol by its 
competitive inhibition against HMG-CoA reductase which 
serves as a rate-determining enzyme for the biosynthesis 
of cholesterol. Furthermore, as the results of research of compounds 
which exhibit the effect of lowering the concentration of 
cholesterol in the blood, pravastatin which is a natural 
material or a derivative thereof (as disclosed in 
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 57-2240), 
simvastatin (USP 4,231,938) and lovastatin (USP  
 
4,444,784) have been discovered and are used clinically 
in practice. Furthermore, varieties of compounds have been 
synthesized in an attempt to obtain compounds having
