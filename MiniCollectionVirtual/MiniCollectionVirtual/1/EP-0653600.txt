<ABSTRACT>
A searchhead (2) which is rigidly connected to the missile (1) is used to determine the sightline spin rates of the missile/target (SL). The azimuth and elevation offset angles ( theta s) which are measured using the strapdown searchhead (2) are transformed into the azimuth and elevation offset angles of a gimbal-mounted and gyro-stabilised virtual searchhead (2V) which is slaved to the sightline (SL) by rotation about its axes.

A method for determining the rates of turn of
the missile/target line of sight with a seeker head (2)

rigidly mounted on the missile (1), the azimuth and
elevation deviation angles (Ψ
sm
 and 
sm
) of the target
measured with the rigidly mounted seeker head (2) in the

missile-fixed coordinate system (s
1
, s
2
, s
3
) being
transformed to the azimuth and elevation deviation angles

(Ψ
v
 and 
v
)of the target based on a coordinate system,

characterized in that
 the coordinate system is a coordinate
system (v
1
, v
2
, v
3
) of a virtual, gimbal mounted and
gyrostabilized seeker head (2v) that is the mathematical

model of a gimbal mounted and gyrostabilized seeker head in
a computer and that tracks the missile/target line of sight

(SL) by rotation with the rates of turn (p
v
, q
v
, r
v
) about
its three axes (v
1
, v
2
, v
3
) by performing a virtual seeker
head's follow-up simulation at the same time, the nature of

the frame design and gyrostabilisation being reflected in
the software of the gimbal mounted, gyrostabilized seeker

head to be simulated.
The method of claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
transformation of the azimuth and elevation deviation

angles ((Ψ
sm
 and 
sm
) measured with the rigidly mounted
seeker head (2) to the azimuth and elevation deviation

angles (Ψ
v
 and 
v
) of the virtual seeker head (2v) takes
place about its three axes (v
1
, v
2
, v
3
) and, on the other
hand, via the rates of turn (p
m
, q
m
, r
m
) of the rigidly
mounted seeker head (2) about the three missile-fixed axes

(s
1
, s
2
, s
3
).
The method of claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the virtual seeker head (2v) tracks the missile/target 
line of sight (SL) with a first- or higher-order time

response.
The method of any of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the quaternion method is used during
transformation.
The method of any of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the Euler's angle method is used
during transformation.
The method of any of the above claims,

characterized in that
 the rates of turn (q
v
, r
v
) of the
virtual seeker head (2v) about its two axes (v
2
, v
3
)
perpendicular to its longitudinal axis (v
1
) are used to
guide the missile (1) by proportional navigation.
The method of any of the above claims,

characterized in that
 any desired frame assembly of the
virtual seeker head (2v) is used.
