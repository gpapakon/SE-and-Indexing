<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a syringe set for storing and administration of a multi-component material, preferably of a tissue adhesive, in which part of the set is formed by a syringe device (1) with several parallel syringe bodies (2, 3) which are made of a plastic material and are connected by at least one connecting web (10, 11; 32; 37, 38) extending between them so as to form a rigid, integral plate-shaped syringe unit (14) which cannot be dismantled, the connecting web (10, 11; 32; 37, 38) exposing at its end a recess (16, 17) between the syringe bodies (2, 3) for reception of a protecting member (41, 42) on filling of the syringe bodies (2, 3); as a further part of the set, the syringe bodies (2, 3) are allocated an operating device with piston rods (22, 23; 22', 23') assigned to the plungers (28, 29; 28', 29') in the syringe bodies (2, 3) and a common handle, the handle (24) being integrally formed with the piston rods (22, 23; 22', 23') and thus forming an integral piston rod unit (21); a dispensing member (50) that can be attached on to the syringe cones (4, 5) is provided as a third part of the set. The syringe bodies (2, 3) of the syringe unit (14) are intended to be filled and sealed mechanically in sterile fashion.

thickness direction of the plate-shaped syringe unit (14) being
different from that of the cross sectional area of the other 

one(s) of the syringe bodies (3).
