<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated circuitry
for checking the utilization rate of redundancy memory elements
in a semiconductor memory device.In the manufacture of semiconductor memories defects are
frequently encountered that afflict a limited number of memory
elements in a memory matrix. The reason for the high
probability of defects of this type resides in that in a
semiconductor memory device the greatest part of the chip area
is occupied by the memory matrix; moreover it is in the memory
matrix, and not in the peripheral circuitry, that the
manufacturing process characteristics are usually pushed to
limits.In order to avoid that the presence of a limited number of
defective matrix memory elements on many millions forces the
rejection of the entire chip, and therefore to increase the
manufacturing process yield, the technique is known of
providing for the manufacture of a certain number of additional
memory elements, commonly called "redundancy memory elements",
to be used as a replacement of those matrix memory elements
that, during testing of the memory device, prove defective; the
selection circuits, with which the integrated component must
necessarily be provided, and which allow the above mentioned
functional replacement of a defective matrix memory element
with a redundancy memory element are indicated as a whole with
the name of "redundancy circuitry , while the set of redundancy
memory elements and circuitry is defined for short as
"redundancy". The redundancy circuitry comprises programmable
non-volatile memory registers suitable to store those address
configurations corresponding to the defective matrix memory
elements; such registers are programmed once and for all during
the memory device testing, and must retain the information
stored therein even in absence of the power supply.Each non-volatile memory register must therefore be made up
of a number of programmable memory cells at least equal to the
number of address bits which allows the selection of the matrix
memory elements. Each memory cell of a memory register is
therefore dedicated to store the logical state of a particular
address bit of the address configuration corresponding to a
defective matrix memory element, and comprises at least one
programmable non-volatile memory element, a circuit for
programming the memory element, a circuit for reading the
information stored in the memory element and a circuit for
comparing said information with the current logical state of
the address bit associated to the memory
