<ABSTRACT>
In an electron beam tube, such as an IOT, ferrite loaded silicone rubber 30 
or some other ferrite loaded dielectric material, is carried by a wall 25 of an input 

cavity 7. The material absorbs r.f. energy, reducing coupling between different 
parts of the tube which could otherwise result in undesirable oscillation. 

Furthermore, its provision on part of the input cavity wall enables easy access to 
be made for replacement and servicing requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electron beam tubes and more particularly to input
resonator cavities of such tubes at which high frequency energy is applied.The present invention is particularly applicable to inductive output tetrode
devices ( hereinafter referred to as "IOT's"). An IOT device includes an electron gun
arranged to produce a linear electron beam and a resonant input cavity at which an
r.f. signal to be amplified is applied to produce modulation of the beam at a grid of the
electron gun. The resultant interaction between the r.f. energy and the electron beam
produces amplification of the high frequency signal which is then extracted from an
output resonant cavity.
   DE-A-4 107 552 discloses a known IOT.
   One known IOT device is schematically illustrated in longitudinal section in
Figure 1. The IOT includes an electron gun 1 which comprises a cathode 2, an
anode 3 and a grid 4 located between them. The electron gun is arranged to produce
an electron beam directed along the longitudinal axis X-X of the arrangement. The
IOT also includes drift tubes 5 and 6 via which the electron beam passes before
being collected by a collector (not shown). A cylindrical annular input cavity 7 is
arranged coaxially about the electron gun 1 and includes an input coupling 8
at which an r.f. signal to be amplified is applied. An output cavity 9
surrounds the gap between the drift tubes 5 and 6 and includes a coupling
loop 10 via which an amplified r.f. signal is extracted and coupled into a secondary 
output cavity 11 from which the output signal is taken via an output coupling 12.The input cavity 7 comprises an inner body portion which includes two
transversely arranged annular plates 13 and 14. The first plate 13 is connected via
conductive spring fingers (not shown) to a tubular member 15 which mechanically
supports the cathode 2 and is maintained at cathode potential. The other
transverse plate 14 is connected via spring fingers to a support 16 of the grid 4 and
is at the grid potential. The input cavity 7 also includes an outer body portion
which is electrically separate from the inner body portion and comprises transverse
annular plates 17 and 18 connected by a cylindrical axially extensive wall 19 and
arranged coextensively with part of the plate 13. The outer body portion also
includes further transverse plates 20 and 21 connected by a cylindrical wall 22
which are partially coextensive with the plate 14 which is electrically connected to
the grid 4. These two interleaved structures acts as r.f. chokes to
