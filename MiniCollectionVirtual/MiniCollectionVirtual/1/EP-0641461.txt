<ABSTRACT>
Encapsulated particles, such as magnetic particles, colored pigments, or carbon black, with high chemical affinity for ink vehicles. The encapsulated particles are suitable for printing inks, as well as for magnetic recording systems, such as audio and video tapes and magnetic storage disks. The encapsulated particles comprise particles having a coating on their surface formed from an ionomer or an oil, such as soya oil, or a mixture of ionomers and oil, and optionally a thixotropic agent, and/or a binder resin. The method for making such encapsulated particles avoids the use of volatile organic solvents and provides printing inks and coating compositions which also avoid the use of volatile organic solvents. Inks may be readily formulated, without the need for any complicated and expensive flushing process, by simply dispersing the encapsulated coloured pigment or carbon black in the desired vehicle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to the field of
magnetic particles and more particularly to the field of
encapsulated magnetic particles and applications
therefor, such as magnetic recording media, including
tapes and discs for storage of sound or data. The
invention also relates generally to the field of printing
and inks useful therefor and more particularly to the
field of lithographic printing and inks useful therefor.
Furthermore, the invention relates generally to the field
of encapsulated pigments and encapsulated carbon black,
for use in printing inks and other applications, such as
toners, coatings and paints.U.S. Patent No. 5,080,986 relates to a magnetic
encapsulated dry toner comprising a fluorocarbon-incorporated
poly (lauryl methacrylate) as core binder.
The capsules shell is either polyurea, polyamide,
polyurethane, polyester, or mixtures of thereof, formed
by interfacial polymerization at the oil (capsules)/water
(carrier medium) interface. The capsules were prepared
first in an aqueous medium then spray dried to form the
dry toner. The spray drying is an ineffective and costly
process, during which capsules rupture and/or
agglomeration takes place. In addition, dry capsules
produced by this technique show very low yield. U.K. Patent No. 1,156,653 relates to a process of
encapsulating iron oxide by dispersion polymerization,
during which the iron oxide is dispersed in an organic
liquid together with a monomer (the monomer is soluble in
the organic liquid). Upon polymerization (the polymer is
insoluble in the organic liquid) the polymer precipitates
from the organic liquid, and is absorbed on the surface
of the iron oxide particles.U.K. Patent No. 950,443 relates to a process to
encapsulate iron oxide dispersions in organic solvent
with a polymeric skin. The polymeric skin is formed by
condensation polymerization.Encapsulated magnetic particles are also disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 3,627,682 which teaches that the
encapsulating shell wall material should be dispersed in
a volatile solvent which is thereafter removed to form
the encapsulated particles. Such an approach is
undesirable because it involves the requirement of
vaporizing a large amount of volatile solvent, which is
both costly as well as potentially injurious to the
environment. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,420,540, 4,511,629,
4,696,859, 4,699,817, 4,713,293, 4,844,991, 5,013,602,
and 5,032,428 are directed to magnetic recording media
that contain nonencapsulated magnetic particles that are
dispersed in a binder and then directly applied
