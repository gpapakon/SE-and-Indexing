<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing gem-difluoroalkanes more economically than the conventional processes, which process comprises 
the steps of: (A) mixing crude C₃ or C₄ alkynes contaminated with polymerizable olefins with fluorinated alkanes boiling 

at -30 to 30 °C and distilling the mixture to remove the polymerizable olefins, (B) reacting the fluorinated alkanes and 
the C₃ or C₄ alkynes treated in the foregoing step with hydrogen fluoride to prepare gem-difluoroalkanes, and (C) distilling 

the liquid reaction mixture formed in the foregoing step (B) to separate the formed gem-difluoroalkanes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparation of gem-difluoroalkanes. CFCs have hitherto been frequently used as 
cleaning agent, refrigerant, blowing agent or the like, 
but in accordance with a rise of concern about the problem 
of ozone layer depletion in recent years, it is 
internationally decided to restrict their use, and alternatives 
for CFCs are vigorously developed. Fluorine compounds, as such or in the formation 
of polymers, can be expected as raw materials for highly 
functional materials in various fields including electronic 
industry and medical field. In these circumstances, gem-difluoroalkanes 
represented by the general formula RCF2R' wherein R and 
R' denote hydrogen atoms or hydrocarbon residues optionally 
having substituent(s) are expected for uses as 
alternatives for CFCs, intermediates for syntheses of 
alternatives for CFCs, or raw materials for highly functional 
materials. For instance, 2,2-difluoropropane is 
used as a foaming agent, a refrigerant or the like (DE 
3903336A and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
17139/1990). A process which comprises reacting an alkyne 
with hydrogen fluoride is known for preparation of a 
gem-difluoroalkane (US Patent No. 2,287,934 and J. Am. 
Chem. Soc., 64, 2289 (1942)). However, there were problems in the above 
process. Alkynes, particularly low boiling alkynes 
such as propyne and butyne used as raw materials are  
 
extremely unstable substances, and hard to handle, and it 
takes much labor and costs in purification to obtain them 
in a pure form. In addition, the yields of the desired 
products are unsatisfactory and the process was disadvantageous 
in an economical aspect. To solve these problems, a process is considered, 
which comprises using a crude alkyne containing a 
polymerizable olefin as an impurity, obtained as a distillate 
after naphtha cracking. Although this process is 
excellent in the points of economical efficiency and 
easiness in handling, there are problems that oligomers 
tend to be accessorily produced from the polymerizable 
olefins, and it is not easy to remove them by filtration 
or distillation. Thus, since a crude alkyne is economically 
obtained as a distillate after naphtha cracking, a process 
is desired for preparing a gem-difluoroalkane simply 
and in good yields using the crude alkyne as a raw material, 
but the desire has not so far been attained. The present invention has been made in view of 
the above circumstances, and aims at solving the problems 
in the usual processes and
