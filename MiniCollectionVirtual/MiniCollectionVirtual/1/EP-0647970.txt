A polarity-reversal-protection arrangement for CMOS 
devices, said polarity-reversal-protection arrangement 

comprising: 

a substrate (1) of one conductivity type; 
a well (2) of the opposite conductivity type 
formed into the substrate from one major surface; and 
a source region (5; 51) and a drain region (3) of 
the substrate conductivity type formed into the well 

(2), 
 
wherein the source region (5; 51) is connected to 
the 
positive supply voltage terminal (VDD) via a low-resistivity 

path, wherein the drain region (3) is 
connected to the inputs of the circuit to be 

protected, wherein the well (2) is connected through a 
resistor (R) to the positive supply voltage terminal 

(VDD), and wherein the ratio of the area of the source 
region (5; 51) to the area of the well (2) is less 

than 0.5, so that the current gain of a parasitic 
bipolar transistor whose emitter is formed by the 

substrate (1), whose base is formed by the well (2), 
and whose collector is formed by the source region (5; 

51) is less than unity. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the substrate (1) is doped p-type.  

 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the resistor (R) is implemented as a subregion 

(51) of the source region (5; 51). 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 2, characterized 
in that the resistor (R) is made of polysilicon. 
An arrangement as claimed in claim 4, characterized 
in that two or more wells are connected through the 

resistor (R) to the positive supply voltage terminal 
(VDD). 
An arrangement as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that additional 

overvoltage protection elements are connected via a 
contact (7) of the well (2).
