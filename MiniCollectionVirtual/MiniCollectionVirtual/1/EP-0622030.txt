<ABSTRACT>
Combination head-protective helmet which includes a cap (13) and an outwardly 
extending brim (14) and thermal imaging apparatus (10) which includes an 

infrared camera (16) for producing an infrared image of a scene or object 
and a display system (20) which generates a visible image of the scene or 

object from the infrared image, the camera (16) is mounted underneath the 
brim (14) of the protective helmet for protection against e.g. falling 

objects and the display system (20) is mounted on the helmet in a position

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new and improved head-protective 
helmet and thermal or infrared imaging apparatus. The helmet 
provides the wearer of the combination with head protection against 
falling objects in a hostile environment, such as for example a 
fire, and the thermal imaging apparatus provides the wearer with a 
thermal or infrared image in the wearer's field of view permitting 
the wearer to see objects radiating thermal energy in the infrared 
spectrum which otherwise would be obscured from the wearer's view 
due, for example, to dense smoke encountered in a fire; the thermal 
imaging apparatus also permits viewing of fire or other hot spot 
radiating energy in the infrared range but obscured, for example, 
by a wall or roof. In a preferred embodiment of the present 
invention, the invention relates to a new and improved fireman's 
helmet and thermal or infrared imaging apparatus. Numerous head-protective helmets are known to the art, such as 
for example the FIREMAN'S HELMET WITH ENERGY ABSORBING LINER 
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,286,339 issued September 1, 1981 to 
Peter A. Coombs inventor and the PROTECTIVE HELMET ASSEMBLY 
INCLUDING RELEASEABLE HEAD RETAINING ASSEMBLY disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,044,016 issued September 3, 1991 to Christopher E. 
Coombs, both patents assigned to the same assignee as the present 
invention. 
Also, numerous thermal or infrared 
imaging apparatus are known to the art for providing a person with  
 
an image of objects radiating energy in the infrared range. 
A combination head-protective helmet and thermal camera 
arrangement comprising the features of the preamble of 
claim 1 is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5 089 914 issued 
February 18, 1992 to James A. Prescott, inventor, and 
assigned to EEV Limited. However, there still exists a need in the art for 
new and improved combination head-protective helmet and 
thermal imaging apparatus which is particularly useful when 
embodied as a combination fireman's helmet and thermal 
imaging apparatus wherein the thermal imaging apparatus is 
mounted advantageously to the fireman's helmet to reduce 
discomfort to the fireman and to provide the fireman with 
hands-free wearing of the combination thereby facilitating 
the fireman's ability to wear the combination while engaged 
in fire fighting and which combination provides the fire 
fighter with the thermal image of objects he cannot 
otherwise see with his natural eyesight, such as for 
example bodies of unconscious but alive fire and smoke 
victims
