<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides highly oriented multilayer films. They are produced by coextruding or laminating films having at least one layer of a fluoropolymer, at least one layer of a polyolefin homopolymer or copolymer and an intermediate adhesive layer of a polyolefin having at least one functional moiety of an unsaturated carboxylic acid or anhydride thereof. With this structure the polyolefin layer allows the fluoropolymer layer to be stretched up to ten times its original length. Such a high orientation ratio for the fluoropolymer film increases the mechanical strength, toughness, and water vapor barrier properties of the film while using a thinner gauge fluoropolymer film. Coextrusion processing can be done at higher temperatures, i.e. in the range of from at about 280  DEG C to about 400  DEG C. These temperatures allow films to be produced in the absence of polymer degradation and film melt fracture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oriented multilayer films. More particularly, the
invention pertains to coextruded films having at least one layer of a
fluoropolymer such as poly(chlorotrifluoro ethylene) (PCTFE) homopolymer or
copolymer, a layer of a polyolefin homopolymer or polyolefin containing
copolymer and an intermediate adhesive layer of a polyolefin having at least one
functional moiety of an unsaturated carboxylic acid and/or anhydride thereof.It is well known in the art to produce oriented polymeric films. See, e.g. U. S.
patent 4,011,874. However, such films tend to expand in the direction
perpendicular to the direction of stretching.It is also known in the art to produce single layer and multilayer fluoropolymer
films. See, e.g. U.S. patent nos. 4,677,017; 4,659,625 and 5,139,878, all of which are
incorporated herein by reference. However, fluoropolymers are difficult to orient
due to their unique crystallization properties. More particularly, PCTFE is
exceptionally difficult to orient due to its extremely fast crystallization rate and
thermally induced self orientation. Its fast crystallization rate produces a highly
crystalline structure that hinders orientation and actually prevents further 
orientation beyond a certain point. Its thermally induced self-orientation results in
a film which, upon unconstrained heating, self extends in the machine or
longitudinally stretched direction and shrinks in the transverse direction.Most earlier attempts to stretch PCTFE films have failed either due to its high
degree of film crystallinity, nonuniform crystallinity, self orientation or a
combination of these factors. Prior art studies of the orientation of PCTFE
homopolymer report a limit of a three to four times orientation or stretch ratio in
either the machine direction (MD) or transverse direction (TD). For example, U.S.
patent 4,544,721 describes a substantially amorphous chlorotrifluoroethylene
polymer monolayer film which is oriented at least 2.5 times its original length, but
no more than five times in the MD. It also disclosed therein that attempts to
stretch crystalline PCTFE result in films that contain holes or tears, or which are
uneven in thickness. Other known attempts to stretch PCTFE homopolymer more
than five times its unstretched length result in film fibrilation and ultimate breakage.
See, e.g. U.S. patent 4,510,301 (orients film containing a copolymer of ethylene
and chlorotrifluoroethylene).It would be desirable to produce a much more highly oriented, dimensionally stable
fluor
