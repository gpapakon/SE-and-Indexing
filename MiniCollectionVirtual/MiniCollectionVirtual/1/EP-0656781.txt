<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of fertilized shell
eggs to enhance sexual potency (libido), and to compositions
comprising such eggs or extracts thereof.Human sex drive is affected by many factors, such as gender,
age, stress levels, and psychological factors. Reduced sex
drive affects the general physical and mental well-being of
those concerned and is a cause for concern not just for the
individual so afflicted but also for his or her sexual
partner.Over the ages many substances have been prepared for enhancing
sex drive, but most have not been proven to have any positive
effect.Those treatments with proven success generally fall into two
categories - treatment with hormones such as testosterone and
treatment with vasodilatory drugs. Vasodilators have a direct
physical effect, facilitating erection, rather than affecting
the individual's libido or sex drive. On the other hand, with
many males low sex drive correlates to low testosterone levels
and in these circumstances testosterone administered by
injection or transdermally has shown some success. The
success however is limited to those whose testosterone level
is low - testosterone therapy has not generally been found to
be effective in increasing sex drive in the normal adult.We have now found however that sex drive can be increased by
administration into the gastrointestinal tract of fertilized
shell eggs, i.e. reptile or avian eggs, or compositions
derived therefrom.As described further below this surprising effect has been
proven in double blind clinical trials.In these trials it has been shown that the subjects having low
testosterone levels may have those levels significantly 
increased. Nonetheless, unlike direct testosterone therapy,
the treatment enhances sex drive even in individuals with
normal testosterone levels.Thus viewed from one aspect this invention provides a
composition comprising a libido and/or testosterone enhancing
amount of fertilized incubated shell egg yolk or a libido or
testosterone enhancing component thereof, optionally together
with one or more physiologically tolerable carriers or
excipients.This composition may be used to increase libido or to enhance
body testosterone levels in the human or non-human mammalian
body by administration to said body, preferably into the
gastrointestinal tract thereof, e.g. rectally or more
preferably orally.By a shell egg is meant an animal egg (e.g. bird or reptile
egg) having an opaque shell.Particularly preferably, the eggs used will be avian eggs,
especially those from
