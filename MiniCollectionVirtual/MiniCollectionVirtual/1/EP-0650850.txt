<ABSTRACT>
A recording medium for ink-jet printing which 
comprises an ink-receiving layer provided on a 

poly(olefin)-coated paper substrate in which the ink-receiving 
layer comprises at least one hydrophilic 

resin. The recording medium is capable of recording 
clear, brilliant, glossy color images of high image 

density comparable in look and feel to conventional 
photographic prints.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an opaque
recording medium suitable for ink-jet recording. More
Particularly, the present invention relates to an
opaque recording medium suitable for ink-jet recording
capable of recording clear, brilliant, glossy color
images of high image density comparable in look and
feel to conventional color photographic prints, as well
as to a method of ink-jet recording employing the
recording medium.In ink-jet recording, numerous schemes may be
utilized to control the deposition of ink droplets on
the image-recording medium to yield the desired image.
In one process, known as continuous ink-jet recording,
a continuous stream of droplets is charged and
deflected in an imagewise manner onto the surface of
the image-recording medium, while unimaged droplets are
caught and returned to the ink sump. In another
process, known as drop-on-demand ink-jet recording,
individual ink droplets are projected as needed onto
the image-recording medium to form the desired image.
Common methods of controlling the projection of ink
droplets in drop-on-demand printing include
piezoelectric transducers and thermal bubble formation.
Ink-jet recording is rapidly gaining acceptance by the
public as a recording method which generates little
noise and permits economical and multi-color printing.As the ink for ink-jet recording, there are
mainly used aqueous inks which meet the requirements
for safety and recording characteristics, and these
inks contain, in many cases, a polyhydric alcohol or
the like for preventing nozzle plugging and enhancing
discharging stability.As the recording medium for ink-jet
recording, there have conventionally been used ordinary 
papers and so-called ink-jet recording papers comprised
of a substrate and an ink-receiving layer formed on the
substrate. In fact, most of the recording media for
surface image observation of the prior art have
employed a system in which a porous ink-receiving layer
is provided on the surface of a substrate, for example,
paper, and the recording agent is fixed by permitting
the ink to be received into the porous voids of the
receiving layer. One such type of porous ink-receiving
layer which has been used in ink-jet recording systems
is comprised of a pigment-filled, water-soluble,
hydrophilic resin or polymer having a high degree of
ink absorbency. Examples of such polymers include
various naturally occuring water-soluble, hydrophilic
resins such as albumin, gelatin, casein, starch,
cationic starch, gum arabic, sodium alginate and
various synthetic
