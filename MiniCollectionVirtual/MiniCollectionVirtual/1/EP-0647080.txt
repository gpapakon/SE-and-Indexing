<ABSTRACT>
Call handoffs in a wireless communications system are effected in a 
substantially glitchless manner by the mobile terminal (4) that is involved in a 

handoff triggering the handoff by transmitting a handoff coordination signal 
simultaneously to the base stations (1,2) that are involved in the handoff. The base 

stations receive the signal substantially simultaneously, and in response the base 
station that has been serving the mobile terminal's call ceases to do so, while the 

base station that is henceforth to serve the mobile terminal's call commences to do 
so at the same instant in time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of coordinating call handoff in a wireless communications system, and to mobile terminals and to individual base stations, for a wireless communication system.User mobility is central to mobile wireless communications systems.
Consequently, a wireless system user frequently is in motion during an active call.
In such cases, the user may pass out of range of the base station with which the
user's station set (also commonly referred to as a user terminal, mobile terminal, or
handset) is presently communicating. Many wireless systems provide the ability for
a call to undergo a "handoff." where the system moves the call from the old base
station that is presently serving the call to a new base station closer to the user's
present position. It is not unusual for the parties to the call to hear an audible glitch
as the call is handed off, due to poor coordination of the timing of the handoff. This
glitch is usually caused by lost or garbled voice samples during the switch-over as
the old base station stops transmitting and receiving and the new base station begins.Traditional approaches to solving this problem often attempt to
eliminate the glitch within the wireless system by temporarily having both the new
and the old base stations receive the call traffic from the mobile terminal and
conferencing the traffic received from the two base stations during the handoff. This
may reduce the glitch heard by the other party to the call but does not eliminate the
glitch heard by the mobile wireless user whose motion caused the handoff to occur.
Other approaches place undesirable constraints on system operation or user mobility.Newer digital cellular offerings smooth the handoff process by a
mechanism known as "soft" handoff, where traffic passed to and from the mobile
terminal is replicated by both the new and the old base stations during the handoff.
By replicating the traffic, voice samples and signaling messages are less likely to be
lost, and glitches are reduced. However, replicating the traffic and handling the
replicas within the wireless system is complex and costly, requiring expensive
hardware for traffic duplication and selection and duplicate-traffic synchronization.
Moreover, it is only applicable to certain technologies - i.e., CDMA. According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a method as
claimed in claim 1.According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a mobile
5 terminal as claimed in claim 4.According to a further aspect of this

A method of coordinating a handoff of a call involving a mobile
terminal (4) from a first base station (1) to a second base station (2) in a

wireless communications system, 
CHARACTERISED BY
 the steps of:

transmitting (232, 238) a handoff coordination signal from the
mobile terminal simultaneously to both the first base station which is presently

transmitting the call to the mobile terminal, and the second base station which
is presently not transmitting the call to the mobile terminal;
receiving (234, 240; 236, 242) the handoff coordination signal
substantially simultaneously at both the first and the second base stations;
in response to the receipt, the first base station ceasing (248) to
transmit the call to the mobile terminal at an instant in time; and
in response to the receipt, the second base station commencing
(246) to transmit the call to the mobile terminal at effectively same said Instant

in time;
whereby timing of the handoff is coordinated (232, 238) through the handoff coordination signal by the
mobile terminal and the handoff is performed (246; 248) substantially

simultaneously by both the first and the second base stations.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein:

the step of transmitting a handoff coordination signal comprises the
step of
transmitting (232, 238) a sequence of signals each having a
different value including a predetermined value;
the step of ceasing to transmit comprises the step of
upon receipt (236, 242) of the sequence of signals including the
signal having the predetermined value, the first base station ceasing (248) to

transmit the call to the mobile terminal; and
the step of commencing to transmit comprises the step of 
upon receipt (234, 240) of the sequence of signals including the
signal having the predetermined value, the second base station commencing

(246) to transmit the call to the mobile terminal.
A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein:

the step of transmitting a sequence of signals comprises the step
