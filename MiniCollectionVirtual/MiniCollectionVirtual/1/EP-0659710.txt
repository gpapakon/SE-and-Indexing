<ABSTRACT>
For protecting fibre composites comprising ceramic fibres, a coating (2) of ceramic material is formed on the surface (1S) of a component (1) comprising a fibre composite (1). The coating (2) can, if necessary, be provided with reinforcement (2V). The surface (2S) of the coating (2) can have grooves of defined width and depth milled into it, which grooves protect the fibre composite (1) on crack formation from the attacks of the particles entrained in the hot gas.

<CLAIMS>
Process for protecting fibre composite material
made of ceramic fibres by means of a coating (2) of a

ceramic material, characterized in that at least one
coating (2) is applied to the surface (1S) of components

(1) made of ceramic-fibre composite materials from a
suspension formed from water or alcohol and a ceramic

powder in the form of aluminosilicate, aluminium oxide,
zirconium oxide or silicon carbide which has a particle

size of 5 µm and whose proportion is 40% by weight based
on the total amount of suspension used and into which a

dispersant in the form of polyacrylic acid or HNO
3
 is
additionally mixed, in that the suspension applied is

dried and the application of the suspension and the
drying is repeated until the applied coating (2) has the

thickness desired after completion of the production
process, and in that the last drying step is followed by

heat treatment at a temperature of at most 1550°C for
from 1 to 10 hours.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, before the heat treatment of the coating (2), an

aluminium nitrate solution is applied to the surface (2S)
thereof.
Process according to either one of Claims 1 and
2, characterized in that grooves (3) having a depth of

from 0.1 to 1 mm and a width of from 0.1 to 1 mm are
milled into the surface (2S) of the coating (2) prior to

heat treatment.
Process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that to form a reinforcement (2R) on the

surface (2S) of the coating (2), a suspension having the
same composition as that for the formation of the coating

(2) is applied, in that the particle size of the ceramic
powder used is selected so as to be less than 2 µm, and

in that to form the reinforcement (2R) the suspension is
repeatedly applied and dried until the reinforcement (2R)

has the thickness desired after completion of the production
process, and in that the last drying step is followed

by heat treatment at a maximum of 1550°C for from 
1 to 10 hours.
