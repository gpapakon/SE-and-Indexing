<ABSTRACT>
In a preferred embodiment, the disclosed method of making a compound 
semiconductor (e.g., InP, GaAs) device comprises etching of a semiconductor body 

by exposure of the body to a chemical beam or beams that comprise an etching 
medium (e.g., PCl₃,AsCl₃) and a precursor chemical (e.g., trimethylindium, 

trimethylgallium), followed by chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) growth of 
semiconductor material on the etched surface without exposure of the semiconductor 

body to the ambient atmosphere. Presence of the precursor chemical in the etching 
beam can result in significantly improved surface morphology, with attendant high 

quality re-growth. Multiple etching/growth sequences are facilitated by the almost 
instantaneous (e.g., about 1s) switching between the etching and growth modes that 

is possible in a reactor according to the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to methods of making compound semiconductor 
(typically III/V semiconductor) devices that comprise semiconductor material 
removal by exposure of a semiconductor body to a reactive chemical medium. Chemical beam epitaxy (CBE) is a very versatile semiconductor 
epitaxial growth technique that utilizes beams of compound ("precursor") chemicals 
directly impinging onto a heated semiconductor substrate surface. See, for instance, 
W. T. Tsang, JournalofCrystalGrowth, Vol. 105, p. 1 (1990); and W. T. Tsang, 
JournalofCrystalGrowth, Vol. 120, p. 1 (1992). Under properly controlled 
conditions, decomposition of the arriving precursor chemicals results in the 
incorporation of the desired elements to produce an epitaxial film on a single crystal 
substrate. Etching of some III/V semiconductors by exposure to an appropriate 
gaseous medium is also known. For instance, GaAs etching by chlorine 
(3 × 10⁻⁴ Torr Cl₂, 200°C) gas in a vacuum chamber has been reported. See R. A. 
Hamm et al., AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 61, p. 592 (1992). The etching of InP 
and GaAs by HCl in a MOVPE reactor (e.g., 76 Torr HCl, 625°C) has also been 
reported. See for instance, C. Caneau et al., JournalofCrystalGrowth, Vol. 107, p. 
203 (1991). Y. Kadoya et al., AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 61(14), p. 1658, disclose 
etching GaAs by exposure to Cl₂ (3 minutes, 150°C) in an etch chamber, 
transferring the sample to a MBE growth chamber through a UHV transfer tunnel, 
followed by growth of epitaxial AlGaAs by MBE (at 580°C) on the etched surface. U.S. patent 4,897,361 discloses patterning of a semiconductor mask 
layer by a technique that comprises exposure to an ion beam and dry etching, 
followed by in-situ growth of epitaxial semiconductor material, all without exposure 
of the sample to the ambient atmosphere. See also U.S. patent 5,106,764. Certain disadvantages are associated with prior art etching techniques, 
including the multi-chamber etch/growth techniques. For instance, it is typically not 
possible to switch rapidly (e.g., within about 1 s) from etching to growth or vice 
versa. This is a disadvantage in the manufacture of devices that require multiple 
etching/growth sequences. Furthermore, prior art low pressure techniques typically 
are limited to substrate temperatures below the preferential evaporation temperature 
of the group V element or elements (e.g., ≲300°C for InP), in order to prevent  
 
surface morphology degradation. Prior art techniques are also limited with regard to 
possible
