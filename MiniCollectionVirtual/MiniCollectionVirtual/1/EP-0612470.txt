<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a disinfectant concentrate comprising amine and alcohol, characterised in that the alcohol component comprises at least one glycol ether which is miscible with water to some extent, and the amine component comprises at least one secondary and/or tertiary hydroxyl-free alkylamine. The invention furthermore relates to a disinfectant which can be prepared using the disinfectant concentrate, and to the use of the disinfectant concentrate, or the disinfectant, as a bactericide, in particular a mycobactericide, a fungicide or a virucide.
