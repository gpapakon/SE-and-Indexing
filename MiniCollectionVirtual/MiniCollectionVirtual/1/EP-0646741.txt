<ABSTRACT>
A leakproof double seat valve comprises two slide-valve bodies (1, 2) in a valve housing (3) with conduit connections (4, 5). In the closed position, the two slide-valve bodies (1, 2), which can be actuated independently of one another, rest against valve seats (6, 7) in the valve housing (3) and are at a distance apart, thus forming a leakage cavity (8). During the opening process, the first slide-valve body (1) can be brought to rest against the other, second slide-valve body (2) before it leaves its valve seat (6), the former movement involving a reduction in the size of the leakage cavity (8). The second slide-valve body (2) is provided with a tubular extension (9) which is passed out of the valve housing (3) in a sealed manner and connects the leakage cavity (8) to the surroundings of the valve. In a double seat valve of this kind, optimum cleaning with minimum consumption of flushing agent is achieved by virtue of the fact that the two slide-valve bodies (1, 2) can each be moved independently of the other by a partial stroke in the opposite direction to that of opening into a flushing position in which the slide-valve body (1 or 2) is free of its valve seat (6 or 7) and rests against a housing stop (13 or 14) provided with openings (11 or 12) for flushing agent.

Double valve arrangement, operating in a 
leakage-free manner and comprising two slide valve 

bodies (1, 2) in a valve housing (3) with pipe 
connections (4, 5), wherein the two slide valve bodies 

(1, 2) are actuatable independently of each other and, 
in the closed position, lie adjacent valve seats (6, 7) 

in the valve housing (3), said bodies being disposed 
behind one another with a spacing therebetween and 

forming a leakage cavity (8) therebetween, and the first 
slide valve body (1) being attachable to the other 

second slide valve body (2) during the opening process 
prior to leaving its valve seat (6) so as to reduce the 

size of the leakage cavity (8), said second body being 
provided with a tubular extension member (9), which 

extends from the valve housing (3) with sealing and 
connects the leakage cavity (8) to the surrounding area 

of the valve arrangement, and wherein the two slide 
valve bodies (1, 2) are each displaceable into a rinsing 

position by a partial stroke orientated in opposition to 
the opening movement, characterised in that the two 

slide valve bodies (1, 2), which are displaceable into 
the respective rinsing position independently of each 

other, are free of their respective valve seat (6 or 7) 
in the rinsing position and abut against a respectively 

associated housing stop member (13 or 14), which is 
provided with rinsing agent passages (11 and 12 

respectively). 
Double valve arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the first slide valve body (1) has 

a smaller diameter than the second slide valve body (2). 
Double valve arrangement according to claim 1 or 
2, characterised in that the first slide valve body (1)  

 
has, on its side facing the second slide valve body (2), 

a flanged edge (15) for the associated housing stop 
member (13). 
Double valve arrangement according to one of 
claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the two slide valve 

bodies (1, 2) each have a bevel (16) for the associated 
housing stop member (13, 14). 
Double valve arrangement according to one of 
claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the valve seats (6, 

7) are provided with sealing rings (17), which are 
retained by housing inserts (18, 19). 
Double valve arrangement according to one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the two slide valve 

bodies (1, 2) are actuatable from one side by means of a 
valve drive (20). 
Double valve arrangement according to claim 6, 
characterised in that the first slide valve body (1) is 

actuatable by a hollow rod (21), in which an actuating 
rod (22) is disposed for actuating the second slide 

valve body (2). 
Double valve arrangement according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the first slide valve body (1) 

has, on the side situated opposite the second slide 
valve body (2), with a spacing therefrom, a sealing 

cylinder (23) which, together with its sealing seat 
(24), is rinsable in the rinsing position through an 

annular chamber (25), which communicates with the 
leakage cavity (8) via a connection pipe (26), which 

extends between the hollow rod (21) and the actuating 
rod (22).
