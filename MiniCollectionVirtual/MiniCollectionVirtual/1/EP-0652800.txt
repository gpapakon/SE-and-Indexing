<ABSTRACT>
The amount of N2O in flue gases discharged from a fluidized bed combustion system is minimized by effecting vigorous and intimate mixing of the flue gases (with entrained particles) from a fluidized bed by increasing the velocity of the flue gases and then decreasing the velocity from the increased level, introducing a N2O decomposing catalyst into the flue gases and particles immediately after increasing and decreasing of the velocity, and mixing the N2O catalyst with the flue gases and particles, to effect decomposition of the N2O. The catalyst is a calcium based sorbent, such as CaO or limestone, although NiO and other catalysts also may be utilized. Normally the decomposition takes place without increasing the temperature of the flue gases. The increase in velocity is achieved by providing a constriction in the combustor vessel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
reducing emissions, such as sulfur oxides (SO2), 
nitrous oxides (N2O) and carbon monoxide (CO), to 
the atmosphere from the combustion of nitrogen 
containing combustible compounds. More 
specifically, this invention relates to a method for 
reducing such emissions when combusting solid fuels 
or the like in fluidized bed combustors. Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is known to 
result in efficient combustion, as well as, 
efficient sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emission 
control. Due to intimate mixing of solid material 
and gases an efficient combustion is achieved in the 
fluidised bed already at low combustion temperatures 
700 - 1000°C. Sulfur oxides (SO2) are captured at 
this relatively low combustion temperature, which is 
optimal for SO2 reduction by milled limestone 
injected with the fuel into the combustion chamber. 
The relatively low combustion temperature needed in 
a FBC also results in reduced formation of nitrogen 
oxides NOx, i.e. NO2 and NO. NOx emissions from FBC 
are typically in the range of 100 - 400 ppm.  
 The above mentioned improvements in fluidized 
bed technology over conventional flame combustion 
are enhanced in circulating fluidized bed combustion 
(CFBC). Besides providing the possibility of 
burning different fuels in the same combustor, i.e. 
both high and low grade fuels, the CFB boiler 
technology provides better means of controlling the 
combustion process leading to improved boiler 
efficiency and improved control of sulfur oxide 
(SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. NOx 
emissions from CFB boilers are in the range of 50-200 
ppm. Recently attention has been focused on the 
emission of nitrous oxide (N2O) from combustors. 
The atmospheric concentration of N2O increases 
constantly and it is believed to have an effect on 
the atmosphere. While the greenhouse effect has 
mainly been associated with increased CO2 levels in 
the atmosphere, concern is now growing about strong 
infrared absorbers, such as N2O, contributing to the 
greenhouse effect even if the concentration of N2O 
is much lower than that of CO2. Further, according 
to recent research, N2O may indirectly adversely 
affect the stratospheric ozone layer as well. Recent studies indicate that fluidized bed 
combustion, while achieving significantly lower 
levels of NOx emissions compared to flame or 
pulverized coal combustion, may yield higher levels 
of N2O. It has been reported that N2O emissions are 
generated in higher degree in combustors with low
