<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the unexpected discovery that xanthan 
gum can be produced from filtered whey or milk products, including whey permeates 

and milk permeates, by a fermentation process which uses organisms which are 
capable of converting lactose to xanthan gum.

<DESCRIPTION>
Xanthan gum is a commercially important viscosifier produced by the
fermentation of glucose, starch, or sucrose by strains of the bacteria Xanthomonas
campestris. Production costs for xanthan gum are comparatively high and commercial
applications could be greatly expanded if costs were reduced. A significant fraction
of the production cost of xanthan gum is attributed to the raw material carbohydrate
substrates. Therefore, it is desirable to develop methods to produce xanthan gum
which use low-cost sugars or other substrates.In U.S. Pat. No. 5,279,961, we
have described an engineered strain of Xanthomonas campestris which is able to
utilize lactose as a substrate and provide a high productivity of high quality xanthan
gum product. As shown therein, this strain effectively utilizes relatively pure lactose
or whey as a substrate. Disclosed in EP-A-481 785 is a strain of Xanthomonas campestris that
grows in a lactose-based medium, such as whey, and produces xanthan
gum. The use of deproteinised whey (acid or sweet) is also disclosed
therein as is precipitation as a method for the recovery of xanthan from
solution. EP-A-287 363 discloses a process for the production of xanthan
gum using a strain of Xanthomonas campestris. Xanthan gum production
from clarified cheese whey using a strain of Xanthomonas campestris
(X59-1232, ATCC 55258) is disclosed. The resulting xanthan-containing
material is precipitated either in the presence or absence of added
clarified whey. In the dairy industry, efforts are made to recover as much of the usable
protein and other organic values as possible. For this purpose, the whey or milk is
filtered and the recovered solids, which include the predominant portion of the
protein and other non-lactose values, are used for commercial purposes and products.
The remainder, i.e., the filtrate or permeate as it is sometimes called, is usually
considered to be a waste. Processes have been developed to remove some of the
lactose from the permeate. The resulting waste stream from the processing of
permeate, known as "Low Lactose Permeate", or "LLP", has less value than does the
unfractionated permeate.A problem that has been encountered in the use of whey for the
production of xanthan gum using presently available commercial processes, is that the
xanthan product obtained is of poor quality, i.e., low viscosity.We have discovered that excellent yields of high quality xanthan gum
can be produced from filtered dairy fluids, including whey LLP and milk permeates,
by a fermentation process which
