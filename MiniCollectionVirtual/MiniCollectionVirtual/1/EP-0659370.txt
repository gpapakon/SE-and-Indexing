<ABSTRACT>
Attached to the front face of a side wall (3) of a show case composed of glass is a continuous sealing lip (10) which presses onto a continuous face (12) of a door (1) when the nonwoven part (8), fastened beside the sealing lip (10) and running all the way round, is in engagement with the hooks of a continuous hook part (9) firmly joined to the door (1). In the closed state of the door (1), the nonwoven and hook part lie flush one on the other. In this way, a show case with a rotatable door (1) can be closed off in an air-tight fashion from the environment when the door (1) at its points of contact with the door opening, and the door opening of the show case itself, are continuously provided with the nonwoven part (8) and with the hook part (9), respectively.
