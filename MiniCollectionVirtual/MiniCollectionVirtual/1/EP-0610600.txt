<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is the synthesis of terminal diols, 
which are organic intermediates used in order to 

produce polymeric materials, by starting from terminal 
diolefins, which synthesis is based on the oxidation of 

diolefins to yield diepoxides, in a double-phase 
aqueous-organic system with hydrogen peroxide and in 

the presence of catalysts soluble in the organic phase, 
followed by a reaction of reduction of the resulting 

diepoxides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the synthesis of 
terminal diols, by starting from terminal diolefins, 
which synthesis is based on the oxidation of said 
diolefins in order to yield diepoxides in a double-phase, 
aqueous-organic system with hydrogen peroxide 
and in the presence of catalysts soluble in the 
organic phase, followed by a reaction of reduction of 
the resulting diepoxides. The 1,omega-diols of general formula (I): 
OH-(CH2)n-OH 
are compounds which are widely used in the sector of 
polymeric materials and, in particular, as monomers for 
polyesters and polyurethanes. They are prepared through several routes which 
however display a validity which is often limited to 
just one of the compounds represented by formula (I). So, a large number of processes exist for 
preparing ethylene glycol (in which n = 2) or 1,4-butanediol 
(in which n = 4), as described in Ullmann's 
Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Fifth Edition, 
Vol. A 10, pages 104-107 and Vol. A 4, pages 458-459. The terms of the series in which n is higher than 
4 are prepared, on the contrary, by means of the 
catalytic hydrogenation of the corresponding dicarboxy 
acids or their esters according to the following 
reaction:  
 
ROOC-(CH2)n-2-COOR + 4H2  Catalyst /   OH-(CH2)n-OH + 2ROH 
in which R = H or alkyl. However, the hydrogenation cited above requires 
high pressures (15,2-45,6 MPa) (150-450 atm) and equally high 
temperatures (150-250°C). Furthermore, many dicarboxy acids are not easily 
available, or are only available in limited amounts. Owing to these reasons, it would be desirable to 
have available a synthesis of 1,omega-diols of formula 
(I), which is suitable for a large number of terms of 
the series, and, simultaneously, cheap. Recently, following the industrial developement of 
metatesis reactions, large amounts of alpha,omega-dienes 
of formula (II): 
CH2=CH-(CH2)n-4-CH=CH2 
have become available, which the present Applicant has 
found to constitute a considerably interesting starting 
material for the synthesis of 1,omega-diols of formula 
(I), without any of the drawbacks which affect the 
prior art. Therefore, the subject-matter of the present 
invention is the synthesis of terminal diols of formula 
(I), in which n ≥ 8, by starting from terminal 
diolefins having the formula (II), which synthesis is 
based on the following reactions carried out 
sequentially, with or without separation of the 
diepoxide (III) reported hereinunder: 
(a) epoxidation of both double bonds of the diene of 
formula (II);
