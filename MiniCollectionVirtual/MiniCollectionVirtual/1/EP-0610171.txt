<ABSTRACT>
In a feeder apparatus for pigs, with a run-through cage (1), which in each case receives a single animal, with a lockable entrance door (4) and an exit door (5) which can be actuated from the inside of the cage, a feed dispensing device (7 to 9) assigned to a feed trough (6), and an electronic control arrangement (16) which, via an identification device (15), identifies the animals according to identification marks worn by them and controls the feed dispensing device (8) so that only entitled animals receive their feed ration when the entrance door (4) remains locked but in the case of animals which are not entitled the lock of the entrance door is released and no feed is dispensed, the feeder cage (1), which defines a rectilinear passage between entrance door and exit door (4, 5), has a passage width which lets only one animal through, and, for the feed trough (6) or a feed trough cover (10, 11), a separate drive arrangement (12) is provided, which is controlled by the electronic control arrangement (16) and which holds the feed trough or its cover (10, 11) in a rest position which opens the passage but blocks access to the contents of the trough and, only for an entitled individual animal situated in the cage which has been recognised via an identification arrangement (15), when the entrance door (4) is closed and locked, adapts to an eating position which prevents further passage but allows access to the contents of the trough.

A feeding installation for pigs, comprising a 
walk-through cage accommodating one animal at a time 

and having a lockable entry door and an exit door 
adapted to be operated from the interior of the cage, a 

feed dispensing device associated with a feeding 
trough, and an electronic control device which, by way 

of an identification device, identifies the animal from 
identification marks carried by the animal, and 

controls the feed dispensing device so that only 
authorised animals, more particularly those which have 

not yet received feed during the relevant feeding 
cycle, receive their feed ration with the entry door 

remaining locked, while the entry door lock is released 
in the case of unauthorised animals and no feed is 

dispensed, characterised in that the feed cage (1), 
which defines a rectilinear passageway between the 

entry door and the exit door has a width such as to 
allow the passage of only one animal and a separate 

drive means (12, 18) controlled by the electronic 
control device (16) is provided for the feeding trough 

(6, 7) or a feeding trough cover (10, 11) and holds the 
feeding trough or its cover in a position of rest in 

which it releases the passageway but blocks the access 
to the trough contents and only for an authorised 

individual animal in the cage as recognised by the 
identification device (15), with the entry door (4) 

closed and locked, does it set a feeding position which 
while it prevents further passage at a distance from 

the exit door does allow access to the trough contents. 
A feeding installation according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the feeding trough (6) is  

 
disposed transversely of the passageway at least over 

the majority of the passage width and is closable by 
means of the cover (10, 11) to form a crossable floor 

sill. 
A feeding installation according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the feeding trough (6) is 

extensible upwardly into a raised feeding position with 
the cover (10, 11) open, from a covered position of 

rest in which it is countersunk in the cage floor. 
A feeding installation according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the feeding trough (17) is 

extensible or pivotable laterally out of the passageway 
(1) of the walk-through cage by means of the drive 

device (18). 
A feeding installation according to claim 4, 
characterised in that a round feeding trough (17) is 

disposed to be pivotable into and out of the passageway 
about a pivot (19) provided near its edge and in the 

region of one side wall (3) of the cage. 
A feeding installation according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the feeding cage 

(1) is provided with a weighing device for an animal or 
is supported as a unit on a weighing device.
