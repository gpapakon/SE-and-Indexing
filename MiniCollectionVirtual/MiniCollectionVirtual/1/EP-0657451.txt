<DESCRIPTION>
Leukotrienes (LTs) are potent pro-inflammatory mediators produced by the metabolism of 
arachidonic acid. They are believed to have a critical role in mediating the inflammatory 
response and consequently may be involved in the etiology of several diseases including 
asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. Therefore, the 
compounds of this invention, which inhibit the biosynthesis of the LTs, have potential use 
in the treatment of these diseases.
 
The biosynthesis of leukotrienes and their pathophysiology have been well documented. 
Many investigators have been seeking to block the pathophysiological effects of the 
leukotrienes, either by blocking their biosynthesis or by blocking their activity at the receptor 
level. Two recent reviews (J.H. Musser and A.F. Kreft. J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35, 2501 and 
A Shaw and R.D. Krell J. Med. Chem., 1991, 34, 1235) describe the status of research in 
these areas, including results of clinical trials. Results of clinical trials such as those cited 
in these articles support the concept that agents which block the biosynthesis or activity of 
the leukotrienes will be useful in asthma and possibly other inflammatory diseases 
mentioned above. This invention relates to inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis. In particular, this invention 
relates to novel 2-(1-pyrrolidino)-substituted benzoxazoles and pharmaceutically acceptable 
salts thereof, methods for preparing these compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions 
containing these compounds, and to the use of these compounds in the treatment of diseases 
in which inflammation and arachidonic acid metabolism have been implicated. These 
compounds may be racemic or may be a pure enantiomer, and the substitution on the 
pyrrolidine may be of either cis or trans configuration.  This invention relates to novel 2-(1-pyrrolidino)-benzoxazoles of the general formula 
wherein R₁ and R₂ are each independently hydrogen, C₁-C₆ alkyl, -CX₃ wherein X is halo, 
C₃-C₆, cycloalkyl, halogen, nitrile, C₁-C₆, alkoxy, -CO₂R₇ (where R₇ is H, C₁-C₆ alkyl), - 
C(O)NR₈R₉ (where R₈ and R₉ are H, C₁-C₃ alkyl, methoxy), -NO₂, -NR₁₀R₁₁ (where R₁₀ and 
R₁₁ are H, C₁-C₃ alkyl), -SO₂ -phenyl-CH₃, -C(O)R₁₂ (where R₁₂ is C₁-C₆ alkyl), R₃ is C₁-C₆ 
alkyl, C₃-C₆ cycloalkyl, an optionally substituted phenyl ring C₆H₄Z [where Z is halogen, C₁-C₃ 
alkoxy, C₁-C₄ alkyl], -NR₁₃R₁₄(where R₁₃ R₁₄ are C₁-C₃ alkyl), a five or six membered 
heteraromatic ring with one, two, or three heteroatoms which may include nitrogen, oxygen,
