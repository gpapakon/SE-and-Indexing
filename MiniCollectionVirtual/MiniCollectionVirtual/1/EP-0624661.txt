<ABSTRACT>
The oil-contaminated conductor (4) is passed in a cleaning vessel (10) through an aqueous cleaning fluid (8). This fluid (8) is compatible with the environment; it contains surfactants which are highly effective towards oil. The conductor (4) is then passed in a dehydration vessel (28) through a liquid dehydrating agent (26). Finally, the conductor (4) is passed into a drying section (40), where the dehydrating agent (26) which has remained on the conductor (4) is removed. The design is made in such a way that the cleaning process and the subsequent dehydrating and drying process are relatively short; they can, for example, amount to only 20 and 100 seconds respectively.
