<ABSTRACT>
An implantable dual chamber ICD and method senses 
atrial (A-A) and ventricular (V-V) intervals, calculates the 

ratio (A/V interval ratio) of A-A intervals to V-V intervals, 
classifies heart rhythms with V-V intervals (i) above 

a revert rate threshold as not tachycardia, (ii) below a 
high rate threshold as treatable tachycardia, (iii) between 

the two thresholds and below an A-dominant A/V interval 
ratio threshold as a non-treatable tachycardia, (iv) between 

the revert rate threshold and the high rate threshold and 
above a V-dominant threshold as treatable tachycardia and, 

when the heart rhythm is intermediate all four thresholds, 
(v) utilizes one or a combination of advanced discriminators 

(e.g., ventricular windowing, ventricular interval variability, 
sudden onset, AV-delay creep, ventricular electrogram 

morphology, active sensing, minute ventilation, or 
right ventricular pressure) to classify whether the heart 

rhythm is a non-treatable or a treatable tachycardia.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heart rhythm classification
method, and to an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator
employing the same.Conventional implantable cardioverter/defibrillators
(ICDs) generally employ heart rate rhythm information alone
to classify cardiac rhythms. U.S. Patent No. 4,475,551 to
A.A. Langer et al., entitled "Arrhythmia Detection and
Defibrillation System and Method," which issued on October
9, 1984, is an example of such a conventional ICD. However,
there are rhythms, for example atrial fibrillation (AF) and
sinus tachycardia (ST), that can cause a raised ventricular
rate but that should not be treated. Thus, the use of rate-only
rhythm classification is not fully effective.Similarly, rhythm discrimination in conventional ICDs
is less than fully effective due to the fact that, in addition
to employing rate-only rhythm classification, such ICDs
employ ventricular sensing alone, rather than dual chamber
sensing. In the case of ventricular-chamber-only sensing,
supraventricular tachycardias are largely ignored, while any
rhythm that causes a fast ventricular rate will be treated
by the ICD.Accordingly, rhythms sensed by these ICDs are thus
classified as either tachycardia or not tachycardia, and
therapy is applied to all tachycardia rhythms. Another
example of such existing ICDs is disclosed in U.S. Patent
No. 4,830,006 to E.A. Haluska et al., entitled "Implantable
Cardiac Stimulator for Detection and Treatment of Ventricular
Arrhythmias", which issued on May 16, 1989. The
Haluska et al. patent also employs sudden onset and rate
stability in connection with its rhythm classification. The Haluska et al. simple rate-based classifier has
high sensitivity to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular
fibrillation (VF), if programmed correctly. This
is achieved, however, at the expense of specificity in the
face of sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial
flutter. A more advanced system should maintain the sensitivity
of the simple system, while providing a substantial
improvement in specificity.The sudden onset algorithm may be useful in patients
who have a sinus tachycardia /ventricular tachycardia (ST/VT)
rate overlap (i.e., they have a VT which is slower than the
maximum heart rate that they can achieve by exercise).
There is a real concern, however, that this will compromise
the sensitivity to VT as some VTs are very variable and thus
may not satisfy the onset criterion. Also, it is common for
VTs to be initiated by exercise. Onset has the potential to
miss VTs that are

means adapted to be coupled to the atrium and ventricle of the heart
for sensing atrial and ventricular events thereof, said sensing means including

means for timing A-A intervals between said atrial events and V-V intervals
between said ventricular events, and said sensing means further including

means for determining A/V interval ratios which comprise ratios of said A-A
