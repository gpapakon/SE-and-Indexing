<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production of 
dialkyl peroxides such as ditertiary butyl peroxide by the 
reaction of an alcohol such as tertiary butyl alcohol and/or 
an olefin such as isobutylene with a hydroperoxide such as 
tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of a solid 
acidic zeolite catalyst. The preparation of dialkyl peroxides by the reaction of 
an alcohol such as tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) with an 
organic hydroperoxide such as tertiary butyl hydroperoxide 
(TBHP) is known. See, for example, U.S. Patents 2,403,771, 
2,403,758, 2,862,973, 3,626,014 and the like. The 
preparation of dialkyl peroxides by the reaction of an 
olefin such as 2-methylbut-2-ene with an organic 
hydroperoxide such as TBHP is also known. See Davies, et 
al., J. Chem. Sec. page 2200, 1954. In such prior processes, catalysts such as sulfuric 
acid, sulfonic acid resins having a low degree of cross-linking 
and the like have been employed. The use of such 
catalysts has a number of disadvantages including the 
corrosion and safety hazards associated with the use of  
 
sulfuric acid, catalyst deactivation and deterioration 
associated with the use of catalyst resins and the like. 
Canadian Patent 839,312, for example, shows the production 
of ditertiary butyl peroxide by the reaction of TBA with 
TBHP using a gel-type 4% cross-linked sulfonic acid resin 
with the requirement that water be azeotropically removed as 
with chloroform in order for the reaction to proceed. The preparation of organic hydroperoxides by 
reaction of an alcohol such as TBA with hydrogen peroxide 
using an inorganic heteropoly acid is shown in U.S. Patent 
2,630,456. In accordance with the present invention, a process is 
provided for the production of dialkyl peroxides wherein an 
alcohol and/or an olefin is reacted with an organic 
hydroperoxide in the presence of a solid natural or 
synthetic acidic aluminosilicate zeolite catalyst. The 
catalysts employed are at least partially acidic, i.e., not 
all acidic sites are neutralized; the catalysts are 
oxidatively resistant and demonstrate high activity for the 
desired reaction over extended times. The use of the solid 
catalyst is advantageous in that the reaction mixture is 
readily separated from the catalyst by conventional 
procedures.  The process of the present invention can be represented 
by the following equations: 
(1)   ROH + R₁OOH → ROOR₁ + H₂Oor 
wherein R and R₁ are the same or different alkyl groups 
having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, R₂ and R₃ are hydrogen or R.
