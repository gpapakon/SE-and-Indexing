<ABSTRACT>
A field emission microelectronic device (100) based 
on field emitter structures and fabrication processes. 

In one embodiment, the microelectronic device (100) 
includes an electron source (109), a collector (112) 

adjacent to the source (109), and an isolator (114). The 
source (109) and the collector (112) are both coupled to 

a substrate (102). At appropriate voltages on the source 
(109) and the collector (112), electrons are emitted from 

the emitter (109) out of the substrate (102) into the 
collector (112) per unit time, creating a current. The 

isolator (114) is at an isolator voltage to create an 
electrostatic enclosure (144) to substantially confine 

the electrons in the vicinity of the electron source 
(109) and the collector (112). The microelectronic 

device (100) is substantially electrostatically shielded 
and may be used as a current controller in a flat panel 

displays.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
microelectronic devices and more particularly to an
electrostatically shielded microelectronic devices based
on field emitter technologies.An easy-to-build flat panel display has been
considered as the "Holy Grail" in the arena of
electronics. Numerous researchers have been trying to
invent such a display.One essential element of such a display is
transistors or microelectronic devices to control the
field emitters. Various transistors have been proposed
and implemented, for example, using thin-film techniques
to fabricate bipolar transistors and field effect
transistors on semiconductor substrates.Unfortunately, most prior art transistor techniques
are usually not compatible with the technologies to
fabricate the field emitters. A field emitter usually
has a very sharp tip, at zero or negative voltage,
positioned in close proximity to a gate at a different
voltage to emit electrons. Such structures are quite
different to the prior art structures of bipolar and
field effect transistors. Thus, field emitters and
transistors have to be built by different processes,
significantly increasing the complexities in making a
flat panel display.One prior art method tries to use the field emitter
approach to build a transistor. That device has an
emitter emitting electrons, and a collector at a positive
voltage to collect the emitted electrons. However, the
device is not electrostatically shielded and is very
susceptible to influences from the environment. 
Operation of field emission depends critically on the
trajectories of the electrons. These trajectories, in
turn, are influenced by the shapes and electric potentials
of their surrounding structures. For example, if the
device is positioned under a screen with a positive
voltage, as in a flat panel display, the electrons
initially going to the collector would be attracted
towards the screen, significantly degrading the
performance of the device.US-A-4,908,539 discloses a display unit by cathodoluminescence
excited by field emission which comprises a
plurality of elementary patterns, each having a cathodoluminescent
anode and a cathode able to emit electrons.
Each cathode comprises a plurality of electrically interconnected
micropoints subject to electron emission by
field effect when the cathode is negatively polarized
compared with the corresponding anode, the electrons
striking the latter, which is then subject to a light
emission. Each anode is integrated to the corresponding
cathode.EP-A-0,513,777 discloses a
