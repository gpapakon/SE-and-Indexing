<ABSTRACT>
A protective jacket (5,6,7,8,10,11,12) 
for use in a method of framing a 

picture (1). The jacket (5,6,7,8,10,11,12) 
is designed to fit within the existing 

frame (3) of the picture (1), allowing the picture (1) to be viewed 
under near optimal conditions whilst affording protection 

against fire or impact damage. The jacket (5,6,7,8,10,11,12) 
comprises a fire-resistant laminated glazing 

material (7) for viewing the picture 
and a metal sub-frame (6) for providing impact resistance. The 

jacket (5,6,7,8,10,11,12) may also be air-tight or water-tight.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fire-resistant 
jacket for use in a method of framing a picture. In 
particular, the present invention relates to a 
fire-resistant jacket to fit within the existing frame 
of a painting, a drawing, a photograph or the like. In situations where a picture is exhibited, either in a 
private collection or in a public gallery, there is 
invariably an attendant risk of damage to the picture 
as a result of a fire. However slight the risk may be, 
the consequences of fire damage to a valuable work of 
art can be very serious indeed. Conventional fire prevention methods are not always 
appropriate in circumstances where pictures are on 
display. Sprinkler systems, for example, are often 
used in open areas of public buildings to prevent the  
 
spread of fire. However, the associated risk of water 
damage to valuable paintings makes the use of such 
systems undesireable in many cases. In addition, the 
use of containment techniques, such as partitioning an 
area of a building into separate sections each sealed 
off by fire doors, is frequently impractical in open 
public galleries. An alternative approach is to enclose each picture in a 
transparent case made of a fire- resistant glazing 
material. However, the presence of such a case 
surrounding a framed picture can be obtrusive and may 
detract from the aesthetic appreciation of the picture 
itself. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a method of protecting a picture that is 
unobtrusive, and that allows the protected picture to 
be displayed under near optimal conditions. Accordingly, in a first aspect of the invention, there 
is provided a method of framing a picture for display, 
wherein the picture is enclosed within a protective 
jacket and the jacket is located within a frame. In a 
first step, the picture may be loacted in the jacket,  
 
and then in a second step, the jacket located within 
the frame, or vice versa. A picture in the context of 
the invention described is taken to include a painting, 
drawing, sketch, photograph, graphic work, 
illustration, chart, map, collage, engraving, etching, 
woodcut, tapestry or other like work. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a picture for display in a frame, wherein said 
picture is enclosed within a protective jacket 
dimensioned or arranged for retention within the frame. According to a third aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a protective jacket for use in a method in 
accordance with the first aspect of the
