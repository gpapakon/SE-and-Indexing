<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an FET having a high mobility of 
channel electrons and a high saturation electron rate. For 

this purpose, in this invention, an undoped buffer layer 
(12), a heavily doped channel layer (13), and an undoped 

capping layer (14) are formed on a semi-insulating GaAs 
semiconductor substrate (11). An n⁺-type drain region (15) 

and an n⁺-type source region (16) are formed by selective 

ion implantation. Subsequently, a gate electrode (17), a 
drain electrode (18), and a source electrode (19) are 

formed. Since the channel layer (13) is formed by gradually 
increasing the supply quantity of SiH₄ gas, an impurity 

concentration becomes low when the depth from the substrate 
surface increases. Therefore, since the impurity 

concentration becomes low at the bottom of the channel 
layer (13) along which electrons tend to move, an influence 

of impurity scattering on carriers can be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the structure of a 
field effect transistor (FET) which can realize an ultra 
high-speed operation. Conventionally, as an FET which can realize an ultra 
high-speed operation, an FET in which an active layer for 
forming a current channel adopts a so-called pulse-doped 
structure is known. In the FET with the pulse-doped 
structure, the impurity profile of the active layer 
reveals an undoped state from the substrate surface to a 
predetermined depth. However, the impurity concentration 
changes in a pulse-like pattern or stepwise to a high 
concentration at the predetermined depth from the 
substrate surface, and the impurity concentration is held 
at the high constant value to a given depth. At a deeper 
substrate position, the impurity profile returns to an 
undoped state. Such an FET with the pulse-doped 
structure is described in, e.g., U.S. Patent 
No. 4,163,984 or on p. 759 of the following reference:
 
   1986 IEEE IEDM "A 760 mS/mm N⁺SELF-ALIGNED 
ENHANCEMENT MODE DOPED-CHANNEL MIS-LIKE FET (DMT)" 
However, in an operation of the conventional FET  
 
with the pulse-doped structure, the following problem 
occurs. As shown in Fig. 1, a channel depletion layer 2 
generated below a gate electrode 1 extends to the active 
layer 3 (described above) to which an impurity is 
pulse-doped with an increase in bias to the gate 
electrode 1. In the vicinity of a pinch-off region where 
a current channel formed in the active layer 3 is almost 
closed, most of electrons as carriers are moved by the 
channel depletion layer 2 to travel along the bottom of 
the active layer, as indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1. 
Even in a state (Fig. 2) wherein a gate bias is weakened, 
and the channel depletion layer 2 extending to a 
substrate deep portion is retreated to open the channel, 
when an electric field applied between the drain and 
source is high, carriers acquire high energy and tend to 
move along the bottom of the active layer 3, as indicated 
by arrows in Fig. 2. Accordingly, in any case, carriers move along the 
bottom of the active layer 3 where the impurity is doped 
at a high concentration. For this reason, electrons are 
influenced by impurity scattering, and their mobility and 
saturation rate are lowered. As a result, the 
high-frequency operation characteristics of an element 
cannot be improved. A transconductance gm of the FET 
which represents the rate of change in drain current with  
 
respect to a change in gate voltage cannot hold a constant 
value over a given
