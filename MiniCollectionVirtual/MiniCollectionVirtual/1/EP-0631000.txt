<ABSTRACT>
Device (1) comprises: a support plate (2) that can 
be connected to sewing machine (30) in a predetermined 

position with respect to working line (K) of the needle; two 
sliders (7a, 8a) which are free to slide with respect to said 

plate (2) on opposite sides of said working line (K) and are 
equipped with positioning markers (15, 16) which slide 

integrally with respective sliders (7a, 8a) along two bars 
(20, 21), marked in millimeters; one (7a) of the sliders is 

equipped with means for securing fabric (33) that is to be 
worked, and means are present for locking slides (7, 8) and 

corresponding sliders (7a, 8a) in the desired working 
positions. 
By correctly positioning sliders (7a, 8a) as 
reference points for the task to be carried out, pleats are 

obtained that have exactly the desired depths and spacing, 
with considerable savings of time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the area of products made of 
fabric, and more specifically to the subarea thereof that relates to 
the production of fabrics that are supposed to feature pleats, 
generally evenly spaced, e.g., parts of drapes or fabrics with pleats 
of various types. At present, to perform operations of this type, before making the 
various machine stitches that fix the pleats in place, workers in this 
branch of industry are obliged first to do an extensive amount of 
(manual) work subdividing, measuring, and marking or tacking the 
pleats; this entails a considerable loss of time, which is reflected in 
the costs of the finished product. In addition, without fixed reference points it is difficult to 
make the manual measurements sufficiently precise, with the result 
that, once the work is completed, the spaced between the various pleats 
and the depths of said pleats wind up varying slightly from pleat to 
pleat. Some examples of the prior art are provided with features that 
give some reference points and improve under a certain extent the 
accuracy of work, but do not offer the results required by a work that 
has to be carried out inside an industrial system as far as the 
repeatibility and the absolute precision are concerned. For example Doc. US-A-2 966 126 discloses a device which 
apparently is similar to that of the present application, but which 
doesn't foresee any means apt to positively securing the fabric to the 
device same, therefore the precision of work is not assured. Documents CH-A-642 412 and EP-A-475 913 describe two devices that 
are suitable only for effecting very particular works such as fixing 
support means (hooks or the like) on fabrics with pleats, and that 
require, to this purpose, the installation of further devices on a 
sewing machine, capable of moving the fabric on a direction transversal 
with respect to the direction of the usual sewing line.  
 The inventor of the object of the present invention has provided a 
solution to the above-mentioned problems by creating a device that 
makes it possible, once the desired pleat depth and space between two 
successive pleats have been determined, to make the pleats themselves 
based on precise references, which consist of component parts of the 
device; said components need to be positioned only one, at the 
beginning of the task. More particularly, the device that is the object of the invention 
makes it possible to precisely position a piece of fabric on a sewing 
machine in order to produce on it
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device (1) that is able to ensure the exact positioning of a 
piece of fabric (33) on a sewing machine (30) for the purpose of 

producing on said fabric pleats that are of a predetermined depth and 
are spaced a desired distance apart, wherein said device comprises: 


a support plate (2) that is equipped with means (3, 4, 5, 6) of 
securing said fabric on said sewing machine (30) in a predetermined 

position with respect to working line (K) of the machine's needle; 
two sliders (7a, 8a) that are parallel to one another and essentially 
perpendicular to longitudinal axis (h) of said support plate (2), to 

which they are attached in such a way as to be able to slide parallel 
to said longitudianl axis (h) and on opposite side of said working line 

(K) of the needle, with each of said sliders (7a, 8a) having a marker 
(15, 16) that extends perpendicularly from it said 

sliders (7a, 8a) being parallel to the working line (K) of the needle, 
two or more bars (20, 21), marked in millimeters, which are integral 
with said support plate (2) and are arranged, parallel to 

above-mentioned longitudinal axis (h), near said markers (15, 16) of 
said sliders (7a, 8a); 
means (23, 25, 27 and 24, 26, 28) that are suitable for locking said 
two sliders (7a, 8a) in a desired position, 
characterized in that
 
the device is also provided with means of attachment (17, 

18, 19, 34) that are suitable for locking fabric (33) with respect 
to one (7a) of said sliders while the protruding edge of the fabric (33) same is kept taut. 
Device according to claim 1, comprising: 

a support plate (2) that has two or more holes 
(3, 4) for attaching clamping screws (5, 6) and two screws 

(25, 26) that extend perpendicular with respect to said 
plate; 
two flat slides (7, 8) that are arranged parallel 
to longitudinal axis (h) of said plate (2) on opposite sides 

of working line (K) of the needle of sewing machine (30), 
with each of said slides featuring a bar-shaped slider (7a, 

8a) that extends in a direction perpendicular to said 
longitudinal axis (h), a marker (15, 16) that is  

 
perpendicular to the slides themselves, a pair of small bars 

(11, 12) that are parallel to one another, spaced a certain 
distance apart, and are arranged parallel to said 

longitudinal axis (h) of support plate (2), as well as a

extend perpendicular to the support plate; 
a guide bar (22) which is integral with support 
plate (2) and is located between the small bars that form 

said pairs (11, 12) which are attached to slides (7, 8) in 
such a way that the small bars themselves are able to slide 

without play along said plate as a result of the motion of 
said slides (7, 8); 
two threaded bolts (9, 10) that are connected to 
support plate (2) parallel to said longitudinal axis (h) 

which are free to rotate around the axis itself and are 
equipped at their ends with drive knobs (9a, 10a); 
two bars (20, 21), marked in millimeters, which 
are integral with support plate (2) and are arranged parallel

where each slide also has:
 
   a) a small block (13, 14) in which there is a 

threaded hole that is able to mate with one of said threaded 
bolts (9, 10); 
 
and with the locking of slides (7, 8) in a desired position 

being accomplished by attaching around each of said screws 
(25, 26) extending from support plate (2) a bush (27, 28) 

that is forced against slide (7, 8) associated with it by 
locking a threaded knob (23, 24) that is screwed to 

corresponding screw (25, 26). 
Device according to claim 2, also including a 
box-shaped cover (29) to which are attached said two bars 

(20, 21), marked in millimeters, with said cover being of 
such a size and shape as to cover at least the part of 

support plate (2) on which are mounted the functional 
elements of device (1) and having slots and holes through 

which can pass: 

two slides (7a, 8a);  
 
said two threaded bolts (9, 10) that are integral 
with support plate (2); 
said markers (15, 16) that are integral with 
slides (7, 8); 
two bushes (27, 28) that are attached around said 
screws (25, 26) extending from support plate (2); 

in such a way that, with the device assembled, the following 
are outside of the box-shaped cover: 
drive knobs (9a, 10a) of threaded bolts (9, 10); 
knobs (23, 24) for locking slides (7, 8); 
the ends of markers (15, 16). 
Device according to claim 3, in which at the 
ends of each of said two markers (15, 16) is a tool (27, 28) 

which, because it is marked in micrometers, is able to 
indicate any displacement of the marker itself along bar (20, 

21), marked in millimeters, that is associated therewith. 
Device according to one of claims 2, 3, or 4, 
in which above one of sliders (7a) is a rotating arm (17) 

that is hinged to corresponding slide (7), which exerts on 
slider (7a) a pressure that is able to clamp fabric (33) 

while it is being worked, with said pressure being regulated 
by varying the preloading of a spring (19); said preloading 

is applied coaxially to a threaded element (34) which extends 
through both slider (7a) and arm (17), with said spring (19) 

being located between rotating arm (17) and a holding pawl 
(18) that is screwed onto threaded element (34).
