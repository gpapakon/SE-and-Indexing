<ABSTRACT>
A spread spectrum receiving apparatus comprises: a 
reproducing circuit (25) to reproduce a carrier signal from 

a reception signal and a diffusion code; a demodulation 

circuit (26) to demodulate the reception signal into a base 
band signal on the basis of the carrier signal 

reproduced by the reproducing circuit; and a judgment 
circuit to judge the reception data from the base band 

signal from the demodulation circuit. The reproducing 
circuit (25) has an operation circuit to arithmetically 

operate the reception signal and the diffusion code (24) and 
a detection circuit to detect a difference between the 

phases of an output of the operation circuit and an 
output of an oscillator. The oscillator oscillates at 

a carrier frequency in accordance with a phase 
difference detected by the detecting circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus to
receive a spread spectrum signal.Generally, in a spread spectrum communication
system using a direct sequence system, a baseband
signal having a fairly wide bandwidth as compared with
original data is generated from a baseband signal of a
digital signal which is usually transmitted by using a
spreading code sequence such as a pseudo noise (PN)
code or the like on the transmission side. The
baseband signal is converted to a radio frequency (RF)
signal by performing a modulation such as phase shift
keying (PSK), frequency shift keying (FSK), or the
like, and is transmitted.On the reception side, a reception signal is
converted to a narrowband signal having a bandwidth
corresponding to the original data by performing an de-spread
which obtains a correlation with the reception
signal by using the same spreading code as that on the
transmission side. Subsequently, an ordinary data
demodulation is executed, thereby reproducing the
original data.As mentioned above, in the spread spectrum 
communication system, since the transmission bandwidth
is fairly wider than an information bandwidth, only a
transmission speed which is very low as compared with
that of the ordinary narrowband modulation system can
be realized under a condition such that the
transmission bandwidth is constant.Accordingly, a method called a code division
multiplex exists in order to solve the above problem.
According to such a method, an information signal of a
high speed is converted to parallel data of a low
speed, those parallel data are spread by different
spreading code sequence and are added and, after that,
the addition signal is converted to an RF signal. By
transmitting the converted RF signal, a data
transmission of a high speed is realized under a
condition such that a transmission bandwidth is
constant without decreasing a processing gain of the
diffusion modulation.Fig. 15 is a block diagram showing a construction
of a transmitter according to the above system.Input data is converted into (n) parallel data by
a serial/parallel converter 301. The converted
parallel data are multiplied by (n) different spreading
code outputs from a spreading code generator 303 in (n)
multipliers 302-1 to 302-n, respectively, and are
converted to wide band diffusion signals of (n)
channels. Subsequently, outputs of the multipliers 
302-1 to 302-n are added by an adder 304 and the
resultant value is output to a high frequency stage
(RF) 305. The added baseband wide band diffusion
signal is converted
