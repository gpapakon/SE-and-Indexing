<ABSTRACT>
An electron gun for use in a cathode ray tube (CRT) 
includes a cathode, a low voltage beam forming region (BFR), 

and a high voltage deflection focus lens disposed in the beam 
deflection region of the CRT's magnetic deflection yoke for 

simultaneous and coincident focusing and deflection of the 
electron beam on the CRT's display screen. The deflection lens 

includes a plurality of first focus grids disposed in the CRT's 
neck portion including a spaced first pair of grids each having 

respective beam passing apertures, with one of the beam passing 
apertures horizontally offset and the other beam passing aperture 

vertically offset from the electron beam axis. Other 
grids disposed on opposed sides of each of the first pair of 

grids have respective beam passing apertures centered with respect 
to the electron beam axis and are maintained at a fixed 

focus voltage. A dynamic focus correction voltage which varies 
with electron beam deflection is applied to each of the first 

pair of grids for compensating for asymmetric off-axis electron 
beam defocusing at all points on the CRT's faceplate. This 

dynamic off-axis defocusing correction is equally applicable in 
a single beam, monochromatic deflection lens CRT as well as in 

a multi-beam, color deflection lens CRT.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to cathode ray tubes
(CRTs) incorporating an electron beam deflection lens in the
CRT's magnetic deflection region and is particularly directed
to a dynamic lens in an electron gun for compensating for off-axis
electron beam defocusing in a deflection lens CRT.Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown a longitudinal
sectional view of a prior art color deflection lens (DFL) CRT
50. A single beam, monochrome DFL CRT is described and claimed
in WO 93/22791
entitled "Electron Beam Deflection Lens for CRT,"
while a multi-beam, color DFL CRT is described and claimed in
U.S. Patent No. 5,204,585, issued April 20, 1993, and entitled
"Electron Beam Deflection Lens for Color CRT." The present
invention is applicable to the inventions described and claimed
in the aforementioned patent application and issued patent, the
latter of which forms the basis of the preamble of claim 1.CRT 50 is of the multi-beam, or color, type and includes
a sealed glass envelope 68 having a generally cylindrical
neck portion 68a, a frusto-conical funnel portion 68b, and
a display screen 54. Disposed in a sealed manner on an aft
portion of the glass envelope's neck portion 68a is a plug-like
connector 58 comprised of a plastic housing 64 and a plurality
of conductive pins 72 extending in a sealed manner through a
distal end of the glass envelope's neck portion. Disposed on
an inner surface of display screen 54 is a phosphor layer 56
responsive to an electron beam incident thereon for providing a
video image. The phosphor layer 56 is in the form of a large
number of discrete phosphor elements arranged in groups of 
three for each of the primary colors, i.e., red, green and
blue. A charged metal shadow mask 82 having a large number of
apertures therein is disposed immediately adjacent to the phosphor
layer 56. Each of the apertures in shadow mask 82 is
aligned with a respective one of the aforementioned phosphor
elements in phosphor layer 56 for allowing an electron beam to
be incident upon the phosphor element as the electron beams are
swept across the inner surface of display screen 54 in a
raster-like manner. The charged shadow mask 82 serves as a
color selection grid, ensuring that each of the three electron
beams 52a, 52b and 52c (shown in dotted-line form) lands only
on its assigned phosphor elements, or deposits.Disposed within DFL CRT 50 is a multi-grid electron
gun 51 including, in proceeding toward display screen 54, a low
voltage beam forming region (BFR) 74, a prefocus lens 76 and a
high voltage
