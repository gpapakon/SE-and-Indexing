<ABSTRACT>
A housing has a vertical subframe in which is mounted one or more reed switches. 
A magnet is mounted to a carriage which is mounted about the reed switch by a 

two-degree-of-freedom joint. The carriage forms a cup with a base aperture which 
surrounds the subframe. The aperture defines a semi-spherical surface which rides on a 

semi-spherical surface at the base of the subframe. A shell is fixed to the housing and the 
inside surface of the shell has a semi-spherical surface concentric with the semi-spherical 

surfaces defined by the annulus of the aperture and the semi-spherical base of the 
subframe. The carriage has semi-spherical surface portions which engage the shell interior 

and is thereby constrained to rotate about the point of concentricity common to the shell, 
the carriage, the annular aperture, and the semi-spherical base of the subframe. The 

carriage is biased to an upright position by springs which extend between the base of the 
housing and an upper lip of the carriage. When the shock sensor experiences an 

acceleration in any direction perpendicular to the axis defined by the central reed switch, 
the magnet acts as an acceleration sensing mass and reacts to the acceleration, causing 

tilting of the carriage which moves the magnet into a position that causes the reed switch 
to close.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shock sensors in general and to shock sensors employing
reed switches in particular.Shock sensors employing reed switches are used in motor vehicles including cars
and aircraft to detect vehicle collisions. When such a collision occurs, the shock sensor
triggers an electronic circuit for the actuation of one or more safety devices. Devices
which may be actuated include airbags, safety-belt tensioners, fuel system shut-off, and
radio distress signals. Shock sensors typically employ a reed switch and an acceleration
sensing magnet. In one type of shock sensor, an acceleration sensing magnet is
constrained to move axially adjacent to or about a reed switch. The acceleration sensing
magnet is typically biased by a spring in the unactuated position. Such shock sensors are
useful for detecting accelerations along a single axis. In a typical application, multiple
shock sensors will be used, each aligned with a direction along which crash forces are
expected.One known shock sensor for a seat-belt tightening apparatus such as disclosed for example in DE-A-4202418 achieves multi-axial
actuation of a reed switch by a magnet which responds to an acceleration and employs an
annular magnet arranged in a bearing cup. The bearing cup is arranged
in a cylindrical cavity formed in a housing. The cylindrical cavity is co-axial with the
longitudinal axis of a reed switch. Such known multi-directional shock sensor does not completely constrain the
movement of the actuating magnet so as to prevent purely vertical or rotational movement.
Nor do such previous multi-shock sensors provide damping mechanisms to prevent an
oscillatory acceleration of low magnitude from actuating the device.What is needed is a multi-directional shock sensor in which the motion of the
sensing magnet is completely constrained and in which means are provided for damping
out vibration-induced accelerations.The shock sensor of this invention has a carriage mounted by a two-degree-of-freedom
joint to a housing and damped and restored to a vertical orientation by springs or
the like which extend between the carriage and the housing. A subframe extends vertically
upwardly from the housing and mounts one or more reed switches. The reed switch is
mounted vertically on the subframe and defines a vertical axis. The carriage is axially
mounted about the reed switch by a ball-and-socket-type joint formed between the cup-like
base of the carriage and a semi-spherical surface positioned about the base of the subframe
where the subframe
