<ABSTRACT>
Braking device (1), particularly usable for skates (2) 
which include a shoe composed of a quarter (3) which is 

articulated to a shell (3a) which is in turn associated with 
a supporting frame (4) for two or more wheels (6). The 

device includes at least one elastic strut (7) that allows 
an axially adjustable link between the quarter and a braking 

element (8) which is oscillatably articulated to the frame 
and interacts with the ground (16) in its active position. 

The device furthermore advantageously includes an element 
(118) that is suitable to limit forward leg flexing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a skate with a braking device
that include a shoe which is
composed of a quarter that is articulated to a shell which
is in turn associated with a supporting frame for two or
more wheels.In conventional roller skates, whether constituted by a
shoe associated with a support for two pairs of mutually
parallel wheels or constituted by a shoe associated with a
supporting frame for one or more aligned wheels, there is
the problem of braking said wheels in order to be able to
adjust the speed of said skate.It is thus known to use suitable blocks or pads,
usually made of rubber, which are arranged at the toe or
heel region of the shoe; when the user tilts the shoe
backward or forward, the free end of the blocks or pads
interacts with the ground and a braking action is thus
achieved.However, these solutions are not optimum, as they
require the user to rotate the shoe, and thus the frame
associated therewith, at the toe or at the heel, and this
can cause loss of balance with consequent falls.Patent US 1,402,010 discloses a roller skate that has a
band which can be secured on the user's leg above the
malleolar region and to which a rod is connected.Said rod surrounds the leg to the rear and is then
curved so as to laterally affect said leg until it is
associated at its ends, in the malleolar region, with a
lever system that is articulated to a flap that protrudes
from the wheel supporting frame. Said lever system protrudes to the rear of the frame
and is connected to a plate which is shaped approximately
complementarily to the curvature of part of an underlying
facing wheel.This solution is not free from drawbacks: first of all,
it produces relative movement between the band and the leg
throughout sports practice, and this does not make it
comfortable to use.The plate is furthermore activated every time the user
bends his leg backward beyond a given angle, with no true
and easy possibilities of varying this condition.As each user also has a different leg shape, braking is
thus achieved at different rotation angles for an equal rod
length.Said rod furthermore acts and presses in the malleolar
region, and this can cause discomfort or accidental impacts.
Finally, considerable wheel wear is observed.United States patent US 4,275,895 is known as a partial
solution to this drawback, and discloses a brake for skates
having two pairs of mutually parallel wheels which acts at
the rear wheels.Said brake is constituted by a flap which is associated
with the shoe at the rear; a lamina is

Skate with a braking device (1,101,201)
which comprises a shoe composed of a quarter (3,103,203)

which is articulated to a shell (3a,103a,203a) which is
associated with a supporting frame (5,105,205) for two or

more wheels (6), the braking device comprising at least one
strut (7,207) for linking said quarter and a braking element

(8,108,208) which is oscillatably articulated to said frame
and interacts with the ground in its active position, said

at least one strut comprising a lower portion (11,13,207a)
which is articulated to said braking element and an upper

portion (10,12,207b) which is articulated to said quarter,
said lower portion and said upper portion being mutually

interconnected by means of an elastic spring
(9,109,209,309,409) with an exposed outer surface in a

manner such that said lower and upper portions do not
mutually interfere in order to permit said elastic element

to elastically deform laterally when a force is applied to
it along an axis that does not coincide with the axis that

passes through the points for connection to said quarter and
to said braking element.
Skate according to claim 1, characterized
in that said braking element (8,108,208) is oscillatably

articulated to said frame (5,105,205) at the pivot at which
one of said wheels (6) is pivoted to said frame.
Skate according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said at least one

strut (7,207) is substantially rigid if subjected to stress
at its ends and thus along an axis that passes through said 

points for mutually connecting said quarter (3,103,203) and
said braking element (8,108,208).
Skate according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said spring

(9,109,209) has turns which are compacted so as to allow to
use it as a strut which cannot be compressed by a force

applied to it along an axis that coincides with the axis
that passes through the points for connection to said

quarter (3,103,203) and to said braking element (8,108,208)
and is elastically deformable if subjected to a force

applied to it along an axis that does not coincide with the
axis that passes through the points for connection to said

quarter and to said braking element.
Skate according to claim 4, characterized
in that a first stem (10) and a second stem (11) are

rotatably associated with the ends of said spring and
preferably have opposite threads, said first and second

stems protruding respectively from a first head (12) and a
second head (13) which are transversely pivoted, by means of

a first pivot (14) and a second pivot (15), to suitable tabs
that protrude to the rear of said quarter or above said

braking element or are formed thereat, said first stem (10)
and said first head (12) constituting said upper portion of

said strut (7), and said second stem (11) and said second
head (13) constituting said lower portion of said strut (7).
Skate according to claim 5, characterized
in that said first and second stems constitute means for

adjusting the center distance between said first pivot and
said second pivot and thus for adjusting the space between

the ground (16) and a pad (17) which interacts with it and 
is associated below said braking element.
Skate according to any one or more of the
preceding claims, characterized in that it comprises mea

Skate according to claim 7, characterized
in that said means suitable to limit the forward flexing of

said leg are constituted by at least one abutment element

laterally to said frame (5,105,205) and interacts by
abutment with said braking element (8,108,208) beyond a

given degree of forward flexing of said leg.
Skate according to claim 4, characterized
in that said spring (9,109,209) has a close-packed spiral

structure.
Skate according to claim 4, characterized
in that said spring (309,409) has spirals which are mutually

Skate according to any one or more of
claims 9 and 10, characterized in that said lower portion

element (208) and a slider (221) which is slidably

defining, externally to said external portion, an opening
