<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing metal halide phosphor particles, e.g. 
barium- and/or strontium-containing halide phosphor particles, of a 

selected particle size range with improved powder flowability which 
method comprises the following steps : 


(1) firing the raw mixture materials of said phosphor to produce 
a sintered phosphor mass that is pulverized, 
(2) mixing said pulverized phosphor mass, optionally after one 
or more firings, in a liquid mainly containing a water-miscible 

organic solvent with an organic acid dissolved therein, said acid 
being capable of forming with metal contained in the phosphor a salt 

the solubility of which in water at 20°C is less than 0.5 g per 100 
ml, and 
(3) subjecting the thus treated phosphor particles in wet and/or 
in dry state to a separation treatment to collect phosphor particles 

having a grain size smaller than 40 µm but larger than 2 µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing metal 
halide phosphor particles of a selected particle size range having 
their surface coated for improving their flowability, i.e. powder 
fluidity. In radiography the interior of objects is reproduced by means of 
penetrating radiation, which is high energy radiation also known as 
ionizing radiation belonging to the class of X-rays, gamma-rays and 
high-energy elementary particle radiation, e.g. beta-rays, electron 
beam or neutron radiation. For the conversion of penetrating 
radiation into visible light and/or ultraviolet radiation 
luminescent materials, called phosphors, are used. In a conventional radiographic system an X-ray radiograph is 
obtained by X-rays transmitted imagewise through an object and 
converted into light of corresponding intensity in a so-called 
intensifying screen (X-ray conversion screen) wherein phosphor 
particles absorb the transmitted X-rays and convert them into 
visible light and/or ultraviolet radiation to which a photographic 
film is more sensitive than to the direct impact of X-rays. In practice the light emitted imagewise by said screen irradiates 
a contacting photographic silver halide emulsion layer film which 
after exposure is developed to form therein a silver image in 
conformity with the X-ray image. More recently as described e.g. in US-P 3,859,527 an X-ray 
recording system has been developed wherein photostimulable storage 
phosphors are used having in addition to their immediate light 
emission (prompt emission) on X-ray irradiation the property to 
store temporarily a large part of the X-ray energy. Said energy is 
set free by photostimulation in the form of fluorescent light 
different in wavelength from the light used in the photostimulation. 
In said X-ray recording system the light emitted on photostimulation 
is detected photoelectronically and transformed into sequential 
electrical signals. Photostimulable phosphors for use in said 
recording system and disclosed in said US-P are e.g. cerium and  
 
samarium activated strontium sulphide and europium and samarium 
activated strontium sulphide. In US-P 3,175,084 alkali metal halides and alkaline earth metal 
halides activated with an element from any of the Groups I, II, and 
III of the Periodic Table of Elements have been described as X-ray 
storage phosphors that are photostimulable with visible and infrared 
light. Of special interest as luminescent materials are divalent 
europium doped alkaline earth metal fluorohalides as defined
