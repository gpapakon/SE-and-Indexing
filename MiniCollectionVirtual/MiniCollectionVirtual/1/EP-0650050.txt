<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical measuring cell for detecting gaseous components in air, which holds a measuring electrode and an opposite electrode inside a housing, which electrodes are in liquid connection with an electrolyte and by which the measuring electrode is brought into diffusion contact via a gas-permeable electrolyte-impermeable membrane, with the gas components to be detected, is intended to be improved so as to allow effective pressure equilibration between the electrolyte space and the surroundings with simple design of the housing. For this purpose, provision is made for the housing casing (1) surrounding the electrolyte space (14) to be provided with at least one through-hole (34) which is provided with a gas-permeable electrolyte-impermeable barrier (35) closing it off from the surroundings.

Electrochemical measuring cell for detecting
gaseous components in air, housing a measuring

electrode and a counter electrode inside a housing,
these electrodes being in fluid connection with an

electrolyte, and the measuring electrode of which is
brought by means of a gas-permeable, electrolyteimpermeable

membrane into diffusion contact with the
gas components to be detected, 
characterised in that

the housing casing (1) surrounding the electrolyte
chamber (14) is formed from a material of porous,

sintered poly tetra fluoro ethylene.
Electro-chemical measuring cell according to
claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the electrolyte
chamber (14) contains a fixed, porous filler body (18)

which on the one hand is saturated with the
electrolyte, and on the other hand abuts both the inner

wall (19) of the housing casing (1), and the flat
counter electrode (23), and the surface of the

diffusion membrane (13) facing the electrolyte chamber
(14), the membrane in turn carrying a metallic coating

(15) used as a measuring electrode.
Electro-chemical measuring cell according to
claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the filler body (18) is
made of sintered glass.
Electro-chemical measuring cell according to
claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that
 the filler body
(18) has a hollow (26) which penetrates into the region

of the body centre, on the bottom of which is fitted a
reference electrode (27).
Electro-chemical measuring cell according to one of 
claims 3, to 5, 
characterised in that
 the filler body
(18) has recesses (20) on its surface facing the inner

wall (19) of the housing casing (1), these recesses
being filled with the electrolyte and opening towards

the inner wall (19).
Electro-chemical measuring cell according to one of
claims 3 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the housing casing
(1) has a cylindrical shape and 
in that
 its front
apertures (2, 3) are provided with an electrode carrier

(4, 5) which respectively clamp a diffusion membrane
(13, 25) with respect to the housing casing (1), which

in turn, on the surface facing the electrolyte chamber
(14), have a coating forming the measuring electrode

(15) or counter electrode (25), and which are clamped
against the front surfaces of the filler body (18) by

means of the electrode carrier (4, 5) by a fabric
covering (17, 22), one of the electrode carriers (4, 5)

being brought into connection with a diffusion section
(12) accessible to the gas component to be detected.
Electro-chemical measuring cell according to one of
claims 2 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the housing casing
(1) is surrounded by a gas-impermeable jacket (33)

which uncovers the diffusion path between the housing
casing (1) and the surrounding area at selected places

by means of casing apertures (36).
Electro-chemical measuring cell according to
claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the jacket is made of a
tightly fitting shrink tube (33).
