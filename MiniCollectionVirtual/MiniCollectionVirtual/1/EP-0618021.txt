<ABSTRACT>
In a hydraulic roll-gap control system in a rolling stand with a hydraulic adjusting device, actual values relevant to the roll gap, such as the position of adjustment and the roll force are detected and, after comparison with desired values, are fed to a control arrangement to generate an actuating variable for an actuating valve for the actuation of the adjusting device. In order to achieve high control quality not only for one operating point but for the entire working range of the roll-gap control system, the control parameters of the control arrangement (13) are adapted as a function of the detected actual values (s,F) and the actuating variable (v

) and, if required, of the system deviation ( DELTA s) to dynamics of the control process, on the basis of fuzzy-logic conclusions.

<CLAIMS>
Method for hydraulic roll-gap control in a 
roll stand by means of a hydraulic setting arrangement 

(3) which is actuated by way of a regulating valve (6), 
wherein actual values which are relevant to the roll 

gap, such as the setting position (s), the roll 
separating force (F) and/or the hydraulic pressure, are 

acquired, they are compared with associated setpoint 
values (s*), and the system deviation (Δs) resulting 

from the comparison is fed to a control arrangement 
(13) to generate a manipulated variable (v*) for the 

regulating valve (6), characterised in that control 
parameters of the control arrangement (13) are adapted 

to the dynamic performance of the control process, as a 
function of the actual values (s, F) and the 

manipulated variable (v*), on the basis of fuzzy-logic 
deductions. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in 
that in addition the control parameters are adapted as 

a function of the system deviation (Δs). 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the system deviation (Δs) between 

the setpoint value (s*) and the actual value (s) of the 
setting position is fed to the input side of the 

control arrangement (13) and the control arrangement 
(13) generates as a manipulated variable the velocity 

setpoint value (v*) for the adjustment of the setting 
position and in that the controller amplification is 

changed as a function of the actual value (s) of the 
setting position, of the roll separating force (F) and 

of the speed of adjustment (v*) in such a way that the 
controller amplification is increased if the setting 

position given a large roll separating force (F) is 
changed in an opposite direction to that of the latter, 

if the setting position given a small roll separating 
force (F) is changed in the direction of the latter  

 
and/or if the setting arrangement (3) has a large 

volume of hydraulic fluid in the instantaneous setting 
position (s) and in that the controller amplification 

is decreased if the setting position given a large roll 
separating force (F) is changed in the direction of the 

latter, if the setting position given a small roll 
separating force (F) is changed in an opposite 

direction to that of the latter and/or the setting 
arrangement (3) has a small volume of hydraulic fluid 

in the instantaneous setting position (s). 
Arrangement for hydraulic roll-gap control in 
a roll stand having a hydraulic setting arrangement (3) 

which can be actuated by way of a regulating valve (6), 
having measuring devices (8, 9, 18) for the acquisition 

of actual values which are relevant to the roll gap, 
such as the setting position (s), the roll separating 

force (F) and/or the hydraulic pressure, and having a 
control arrangement (13) to the input side of which the 

system deviation (Δs) between the actual values (s) and 
associated setpoint values (s*) is applied and on the 

output side of which a manipulated variable (v*) is 
generated and is fed to the regulating valve (6), 

characterised in that the actual values (s, F) and the 
manipulated variable (v*) are applied to the input side 

of a fuzzy-evaluation device (17), the output side of 
which is connected to a control input of the control 

arrangement (13) for the purpose of setting control 
parameters of the control arrangement (13). 
Arrangement according to claim 4, 
characterised in that in addition the system deviation 

(Δs) is fed to the input side of the fuzzy-evaluation 
device (17).
