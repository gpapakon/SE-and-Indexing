<ABSTRACT>
Products obtained from cereal such as soybean, rice, wheat, corn and meals thereof and usable as food, 
animal feed and aquacultural feed. The production process comprises decomposing phytic acid contained in cereal. 

The products are superior in digestion efficiency to the conventional ones, and the process is superior in productivity 
to the conventional ones.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a process for preparing a grain product.In the present invention, the term "grain" means
soybean, rice, barley, wheat, oats, rye and corn, and
defatted products or brans thereof, and the like, and the
term "product made from a grain" means foods, livestock
feeds, aquacultural feeds and the like which are made from
the above-mentioned grain.Products made from a grain as a starting material are
generally in great demand, and a large variety of such
products are provided.Explanation will be made with respect to products made
from soybean which is one of grains or a defatted soybean.
In soybean and a defatted soybean, phytic acid is contained
in an amount of about 1 to 2 % by weight.Phytic acid is residually present also in a product
made from soybean and inhibits activities of a vitamin B
complex contained in the product to prevent absorption of
minerals and the like contained in the product.Further descriptively, phytic acid is such a compound
that myo-inositol has its all hydroxyl groups each bonded 
with a phosphoric acid group, and chelates with a
nutritionally important trace metal element to form a
hardly soluble compound. Accordingly, when a food with high
phytic acid content is ingested by a human being or simple-stomached
animal, normal intestinal absorption of such
metals, for example, calcium, magnesium. iron, zinc and the
like is prevented to cause various deficiencies.It has further been found that phytic acid present in
products including an isolated soybean protein prevents a
monogasteric animal from metabolically utilizing zinc in a
food. Further, phytic acid is known to have inhibitory
activities on various digestive enzymes in a
gastrointestinal digestive tract on which ions of minerals
such as calcium act as activators and which include
amylase, pepsin and tripsin. It is, therefore, desired to
remove phytic acid from the product.Accordingly, there have heretofore been proposed
various methods for removing phytic acid from soybean or a
defatted soybean.The conventional methods are roughly categorized as (1)
ultrafiltration methods, (2) ion exchange resin methods,
(3) chemical methods, and (4) enzyme treatment methods.In the above-mentioned ultrafiltration method, however,
there is a problem that peptides deposit on the surface of
a filtration membrane during operation to retard filtration
rate, thereby leading to decreased efficiency.In the ion exchange resin method which comprises
treating a protein-containing liquid with an ion exchange 
resin, there are

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a grain food product
comprising the steps of:


(a) cooking grains,
(b) cooling said cooked grains
(c) inoculating a koji mold on said grains as
a starting material to effect a koji preparation,
(d) adding water into said koji preparation,
(e) keeping said koji preparation for further thorough removal of
phytic acid for a period of time hydrolysing protein in parallel and
(f) drying and pulverizing said koji preparation to

produce said grain food product.
The process for preparing a grain food product
according to Claim 1, wherein at least two

phosphoric acid groups are liberated from
phytic acid to form inositol tetraphosphate,

inositol triphosphate, inositol diphosphate,
inositol monophosphate or inositol alone or a

mixture thereof during hydrolysis of said
phytic acid by said preparation, thereby

removing phytic acid from said grains. 
A process as in Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the grains are defatted soybeans and that
said step of keeping said koji preparation

is carried out 30°-65°C.
