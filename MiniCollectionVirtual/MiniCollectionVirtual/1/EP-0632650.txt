<ABSTRACT>
The light control 
system for the illumination system of a film telecine scanner 

comprises an aperture defining mechanism (35,36) and a 
position servo regulator that maintains the aperture at a 

desired aperture opening despite disturbances tending to 
change the aperture between aperture changes and an 

intensity servo regulator that takes into account the lamp 
intensity in resetting the aperture to a new position in 

response to a commanded light intensity related to a scene 
change, whereby aperture changes may be effected within the 

time of scanning a single film frame. The intensity servo 
regulator takes into account non-linear intensity gain of 

the aperture defining mechanism and its velocity of movement 
to establish a new aperture. The position servo regulator 

develops a position error signal by comparison of the 
instantaneous position to the previously set position and 

restores the previously set position. 
The aperture defining mechanism comprises first and 
second movable blades placed at a location in the optical path.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to commonly assigned U.S. Patent
US-A- 5 414 460 entitled
"Mechanical Aperture for Controlling Illumination Level",
and filed on even date herewith.Field of the Invention--This invention relates to an
illumination system for a film scanner and more
particularly, to an aperture control system suitable for
wide dynamic range of operation to a specified illumination
level within the time allotted for scanning a film frame in
real time in a telecine film scanner.Description of the Prior Art--State of the art illumination
systems for telecine film scanners typically include light-sensitive,
charge-coupled device (CCD) linear arrays which
provide a serial output representing a line of a television
raster and a light source for illuminating a linear section
of the film being scanned with either a scanning light beam
or a line of diffuse light. For color television, one
version of a film scanner can include a light source that is
subjected to dichroic filtration to tailor the spectral
content of the light according to the film to be scanned and
directed into a light integrator which transforms a light
beam from a light source into a line of diffuse light
emitted through an elongated aperture for illumination of
the film frame. The line of light must be sufficiently
uniform in intensity and diffusion along its length and have 
the red, green and blue spectral radiance for the film being
scanned. The film is held in a cylindrical shape and moved
past the line of diffuse light. The light passing through
the illuminated linear section is color and intensity
modulated by the image therein and imaged onto three color
filtered CCD arrays as described, for example, in commonly
assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,012,346 to DeJager et al. and
5,003,379 to Moore, Jr. et al.The film motion provides the vertical (frame) scan, and
the linear, synchronized electronic cycling of the CCD
arrays provides the horizontal (line) scan of a rasterized
television signal with both chrominance and luminance
components. A number of the considerations taken into
account in scanning positive or print and negative color
film stocks with such telecine film scanners is set forth in
the article "Optical scanning system for a CCD telecine for
HDTV" by Kurtz et al. in SPIE, vol. 1448 Camera and Input
Scanner Systems, 1991, pp. 191-205.As described in that article and in commonly assigned
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,868,383 and 5,155,596, to Kurtz et al,
and 5,012,346, to DeJager et al, such film scanner linear
light sources have difficulty
