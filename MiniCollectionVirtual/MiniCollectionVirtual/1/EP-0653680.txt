<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
photosensitive composition that forms a polymer image 
by exposure to light, a photosensitive material 
comprising the photosensitive composition, and an 
image forming method which employs the photosensitive 
material comprising the photosensitive composition. 
More particularly it is concerned with a 
photosensitive composition which is highly sensitive 
and used to form a highly detailed polymer image using 
a silver halide as a photosensor, a photosensitive 
material comprising the composition, and with an image 
forming method using the photosensitive material. Energies used to form or record an image 
include light, sound, electricity, magnetism, heat, 
radiations such as electron rays and X-rays, and 
chemical energy. Among them, in particular, widely 
used are light, electricity, heat energy, or a 
combination of any of these. For example, the image forming method that  
 
employs the combination of light energy with chemical 
energy includes a silver salt photographic process and 
a method in which a diazo copying paper is used. The 
method that employs the combination of light energy 
with electric energy includes an electrophotographic 
system. Also, the method that utilizes heat energy 
includes a method in which a heat-sensitive recording 
paper or transfer recording paper is used. On the 
other hand, known as the method that utilizes electric 
energy is a method in which an electrostatic recording 
paper, electrothermal recording paper, or 
electrosensitive recording paper is used. Of the above image forming methods, the silver 
salt photographic process can obtain an image having a 
high resolution. The silver salt photographic 
process, however, requires the developing and fixing 
that uses complicated liquid compositions, or the 
drying treatment of an image (or a print). Now, development is energetically made on 
image forming methods that can form an image through a 
simple processing. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,629,676 teaches 
a method in which polymerization reaction under dry 
(thermal) conditions is caused by the photosensitive 
reaction of silver halide that acts as a trigger, to 
form an image comprising a polymer.  This method has the advantage that any 
complicated wet processings are not required, but has 
had the disadvantage that the polymer formation rate 
(i.e., polymerization rate of a polymeric compound) is 
so low that it takes a long time to form the polymer 
image. Incidentally, this disadvantage arises 
presumably because of
