<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rubber composition
comprising a fluororubber, a fluorosilicone gum, a
fluorosilicone oil, silica and a curing agent.Fluororubbers are characterized by excellent
heat, oil, and weather resistance and by excellent
mechanical strength. As a result, they are used in
applications where such properties are critical.
However, fluororubbers have poor, low-temperature
flexibility. Fluororubbers have been mixed with
fluorosilicone rubbers, which have excellent low-temperature
properties, in an attempt to correct this
deficiency in JP-A(s) 56-50948 and 63-213545. However,
the poor compatibility between fluororubbers and
fluorosilicone rubbers has made it difficult to obtain
uniform mixtures by simply mixing the two. The
resulting mixtures also have very unsatisfactory
processabilities. JP-A 2-196838 has proposed the
addition of epoxy-functional organoalkoxysilane to the
fluororubber and fluorosilicone rubber mixture to solve
these problems. The resulting rubber, however, has
poor mold-release characteristics, and this particular
deficiency imposes restrictions on its range of
application.We have found unexpectedly that the addition
of a special fluorosilicone oil as a compatibilizer for
a mixture of fluororubber and fluorosilicone rubber
results in enhanced compatibility and also provides
cured rubber moldings that have good mold-release along
with excellent physical properties.This invention introduces a rubber
composition that cures to give rubber moldings with
good mold-release and excellent physical properties,
said composition comprising 
(A) 100 weight parts of a fluororubber;(B) 2 to 200 weight parts of a fluorosilicone gum that
contains the CF3CH2CH2MeSiO siloxane unit, wherein
Me denotes a methyl group;(C) 0.01 to 40 weight parts of a fluorosilicone oil
that contains the F(CF2)aCH2CH2MenSiO(3-n)/2 siloxane
unit, in which a is an integer having a value of
at least 4 and n is 0, 1, or 2, and the
CF3CH2CH2MeSiO siloxane unit;(D) 1 to 100 weight parts of a silica micropowder; and(E) a curing agent, in a quantity sufficient to cure
the composition.The fluororubber, component (A), used by the
present invention comprises fluorine-containing rubbery
elastomers, with organoperoxide-vulcanizable
fluororubbers being preferred. Fluororubber is
exemplified by vinylidene fluoride homopolymers,
vinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene copolymers,
vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene copolymers,
vinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene
copolymers,
