<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (20) for the in situ generation of an electrical current in a biological environment characterized by including an electrolytic fluid. The apparatus comprises first (21) and second (23) electrodes of differing electrochemical potentials separated by an insulator (22). The apparatus is adapted to be implanted in the environment. The presence of the electrolytic fluid and formation of a current path by hyperplastic cells bridging the electrodes enables electrolysis to occur and a direct current to pass through the current path to impede hyperplastic cell growth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to apparatus for
producing an electric potential within a biological
environment and more specifically to apparatus for the in
situ generation of an electric current in that
environment.It is known that the application of an electric
potential to selected portions in the human body or other
biological environments can produce beneficial results.
In some procedures, the electric potential produces a
current through the selected portions of the body; in
others it does not.For example, the placement of a bimetal structure in
the bloodstream constitutes an example of the use of a
structure that produces an electrical potential without
any current. Electrons migrate to one of the two metals
that becomes a cathode and away from the other metal that
becomes an anode. The resulting electrical field at the
electrodes produces the beneficial result, namely the
production of a positive surface charge on the anode that
promotes blood clotting.In accordance with other procedures, an external
power source produces a current between spaced electrodes
positioned in a biological environment. In one procedure,
a platinum electrode, as an anode, is implanted
percutaneously in a tumor and another platinum electrode,
as a cathode, is implanted percutaneously in tissue at
least one tumor diameter from the tumor. Current between
the electrodes, generated when the external source is
energized, has been shown to promote tumor regression.
See B. Nordenström, Biologically Closed Electric Circuits
(Nordic Medical Publications 1983). In these and similar procedures, it is necessary to
implant each electrode percutaneously, usually using
radiographic procedures to assure accurate electrode
positioning. Treatment sessions may last for extended
times of an hour or more and may be painful to a patient.
At the end of the session a surgeon removes the
electrodes. If another treatment is necessary, the entire
procedure is repeated.There is also a class of tubular endoprostheses known
as "stents" that are well known and have a variety of
forms. A stent usually comprises a tubular, radially
expanding structure that can be implanted in a vessel to
engage and support secondary tissue and maintain vessel
patency. Stents may be utilized in body canals, blood
vessels, ducts and other body passages and cavities and
the term "vessel" is meant to include all such passages
and cavities. A stent delivery system typically includes
a catheter that supports the stent in a compacted, or low
profile, form for transport to
