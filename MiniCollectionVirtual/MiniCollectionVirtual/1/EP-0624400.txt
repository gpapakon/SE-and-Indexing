<ABSTRACT>
A process for the reactivation, or rejuvenation of a (nickel-alumina) 
catalyst employed in the production of synthesis gas includes 

the steps of (a) withdrawing a portion of the catalyst from the 
fluidized bed of the reactor and (b) treating the catalyst in an 

oxidation zone at temperature sufficient to oxidize and convert the 
nickel component of the catalyst to nickel aluminate and disperse said 

nickel aluminate within the alumina support, and (c) recycling the 
treated catalyst to the reactor, or reaction zone, to reactivate and 

increase the activity of the catalyst. An acid wash may be given 
prior to step (c) to dissolve contaminants and reduce tendency of the 

catalyst to agglomerate at reaction conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the production of 
synthesis gas employing a nickel-on-alpha alumina catalyst, which process includes the reactivation 
of the nickel-on-alpha alumina catalyst. The production of synthesis gas, or syn gas (carbon monoxide 
and hydrogen) via the reaction of low molecular weight hydrocarbons, 
primarily methane, within a fluidized bed of catalyst in the presence 
of steam (steam reforming process) or oxygen (partial oxidation 
process) is well known. Processes wherein the light hydrocarbons are 
converted to syn gas within a fluidized bed of catalyst, e.g., nickel 
on an alpha alumina support, at elevated temperatures in the presence 
of both steam and oxygen (air) are also well known, and this type of 
process may offer particular advantages in that the molar ratio of 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be better controlled to produce a gas 
particularly suitable for conducting Fischer-Tropsch reactions. In 
conducting Fischer-Tropsch operations, it is required that the molar 
ratio of the hydrogen:carbon monoxide used be maintained at about 2:1. Fluidized bed processes offer particular advantages in that 
they provide superior heat and mass transfer characteristics as 
contrasted with fixed bed processes. Fluidized processes permit 
substantially isothermal reactor conditions in conducting both 
exothermic and endothermic reactions. However, there are certain 
problems inherent in fluidized bed operations, notable among which is 
the sensitivity of the process to changes in the catalyst produced 
during the operation. Agglomeration and sintering of the solid 
catalytic particles during high temperature reactions and/or the 
introduction of contaminating substances into the catalyst by the feed 
reduces the activity of the catalyst.  
 During the reaction the catalytic metal component, i.e., 
nickel, grows in crystallite size. The alumina particles also 
agglomerate to adversely affect the fluidization characteristics of 
the bed, and the activity of the catalyst declines. Contaminants, 
introduced into the fluidized bed, eliminate or shield catalyst sites 
with further reduction of catalytic activity. Relatively high methane 
in the syn gas product and the decline in catalyst activity during 
normal operations seriously debits the process, and sooner or later 
the deactivated catalyst must be regenerated or replaced by fresh 
catalyst. Other processes which include a nickel catalyst regeneration 
step are known in EP-A-0 135 729 and GB-A-1 455 030. In the former

<CLAIMS>
A process for the production of hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide from a low molecular weight hydrocarbon by contact with a 

fluidized bed of nickel-on-alpha alumina catalyst at elevated temperature in 
the presence of steam and oxygen, in a reaction zone operated in a net 

reducing atmosphere, which process includes the steps of : 

withdrawing a portion of said catalyst and contacting it 
with an oxygen-containing gas at a temperature of at least 705°C (1300°F) 

to convert the nickel component to nickel aluminate, and disperse said 
nickel aluminate within the alpha alumina support, without sintering said 

alpha alumina support; and 
recycling said catalyst after contact with the oxygen-containing 
gas to the reaction zone to reduce therein the nickel aluminate 

component of the catalyst, and increase the activity of the catalyst 
vis-a-vis that of the catalyst initially withdrawn from the reaction 

zone. 
The process of Claim 1, wherein the temperature of treatment 
ranges from 705°C (1300°F) to 1315°C (2400°F). 
The process of Claim 2, wherein the temperature of treatment 
ranges from 870°C (1600°F) to 1090°C (2000°F). 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the nickel-on-alpha 
alumina catalyst withdrawn from the reaction zone is classified 

according to particle size distributions and divided into fractions, 
only one or some of the factions being treated by contact with the 

oxygen-containing gas.  
 
The process of any preceding claim, wherein the portion 
of catalyst that is withdrawn from the reaction zone contains 

contaminants and the portion, or selected fraction(s) is treated, 
after contact with the oxygen-containing gas and prior to recycle, 

with an acid solution sufficient to dissolve and remove contaminants 
from the surface of the catalyst, without dissolving the nickel 

aluminate, to decrease the tendency of the catalyst to agglomerate on 
recycle of the catalyst to the reaction zone and to further increase 

the activity of the catalyst vis-a-vis that of the catalyst treated by 
contact with the oxygen-containing gas. 
The process of Claim 5, wherein the acid employed is 
one which does not form a residue. 
The process of Claim 5, wherein the acid is one or more 
selected from nitric acid, nitrous acid, carboxylic acids, inclusive 

of polycarboxylic acids, hydroxycarboxylic acids, fluorocarboxylic 
acids and the like, ethylenediaminotetracetic acid and sulfonic acids. 
The process of any one of Claims 5 to 7, wherein the acid 
solutions are of concentrations ranging from 0.01 molar to 

1.0 molar. 
The process of any one of Claims 5 to 7, wherein the 
catalyst, after treatment with the acid solution, is separated from 

the acid solution and dried.
