<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a head of a spot-welding machine or a crimping machine, comprising an electrode (2) intended, on the one hand, to deliver the welding or crimping current to a workpiece (3) to be welded or crimped to another workpiece (4) and, on the other hand, to exert, during the welding or crimping operation, an axial force (F) on the said workpiece (3). It is characterised in that it comprises an electromagnet (8) designed to transmit the said axial force (F) to the said electrode (2).

<CLAIMS>
Head of a spot-welding or crimping machine, 
comprising an electrode (2) for the purpose of supplying the 

welding or crimping current to a part (3) to be welded or 
crimped to another part (4) and exerting, during the welding 

or crimping operation, an axial force (F) on the said part 
(3), characterized in that it comprises an electromagnet (8) 

for transmitting the said axial force (F) to the said 
electrode (2) and a control unit (6) for controlling the 

exciting current of the said electromagnet as a function of 
measured parameters. 
Head according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
exciter coil (9) of the said electromagnet (8) is energized by 

a current source (13) which delivers a current having an 
intensity which is dependent on a reference value, the said 

current source (13) being controlled by the said control unit 
(6).
