<ABSTRACT>
The device has a positionally stable rotating cutting member (1) and a rotating cutting member (2) moveable relatively thereto, which are connected non-positively by means of a force accumulator (8) and which rotate in opposition. The moveable cutting member (2) is mounted freely rotatably on a shaft (6) held fixedly in rotation in diaphragm springs (11) which are elastically deformable in the axial direction, in order to compensate the lateral deflections of the rotating positionally stable cutting member (1), thereby lengthening the service life of the cutting edges. The device is especially suitable for an in-line shed loom, because a high cutting rate can be achieved.

A cutting device for weft threads for a loom having a 
freely rotatable and a drivable cutting member (1, 2), 

wherein one cutting member is disposed in positionally 
stable manner and the other is movably disposed, and 

wherein said members are rotatable in opposite directions 
around axes of rotation (3, 4) extending parallel to one 

another, and wherein a device (8) is provided to connect 
the cutting members in a frictional manner,
characterised in that
 the positionally stable cutting 
member (1) is connected to a drive member (22),
and in that
 the moveable cutting member (2) is mounted 
freely rotatable on an axle (6), wherein the axle (6) is 

disposed in a torsionally secure manner in retention 
parts (11), which are resiliently deformable in the axial 

direction in order to compensate for the lateral 
deflections caused by the rotating cutting member 

disposed in a positionally stable manner. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the retention parts (11) are made 
from spring steel. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the retaining part (11) is strip-shaped 
or discoid. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the retention part (11) is a plane 
or wavy membrane spring. 
A device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the pressing force of the cutting 
members (1, 2) is adjustable.  

 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the positionally stable 
cutting member (1) is an annular disc (11) divided 

into two halves. 
A device according to Claim 6,
characterised in that
 the positionally stable 
cutting member (1) comprises two separating points 

produced by fracture, which are constructed 
diametrally opposite on another in the front side of 

the disc (11) in order to separate the positionally 
stable cutting member (1) into two parts for 

assembly. 
A loom having at least one device according to one 
of Claims 1 to 7. 
A loom according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 the loom is a series shed 
loom. 
A loom according to Claim 9 having a rotor (22), a 
weft thread distribution device (31), which is 

disposed spaced from the rotor, and a weft retention 
device (24), which is disposed in the thread 

direction in front of the entrance to a shed of the 
rotor,
characterised in that
 the cutting device is disposed 
after the distribution device in the thread 

direction, with the positionally stable cutting 
member (1) being disposed coaxially to the rotor 

(22).
