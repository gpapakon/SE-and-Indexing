<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates a thin film deposition apparatus, mainly dedicated to 
the ophthalmic field particularly to field of plastic material substrates. It 
makes possible to effect more than one treatment, that is, many thin film 
depositions can be effected in a single vacuum cycle. For example the deposition 
of a hardening layer on plastic material together with optic interferencial 
treatments, for example antireflecting treatments. Depositions on both substrate sides are provided by this new technique in accordance 
with the sequential process steps: 
layer hardening treatment; optical treatment; water-repellent and anti-dirty treatments to depose on the anti-reflecting 
layer by a PECVD process. The invention lays in the Scientific and technique context of the thin film 
deposition. It gives many capabilities, above all in the ophthalmic sector, for instance in 
lens treatment, laser instruments and so on; for optical cars equipment and 
always when processes by PECVD techniques are requested. In addition, the invention can be utilized for the manufactures of electronic 
components, semiconductors, microcircuits and similar, to be applied in civil 
and military areas. It is the principal object of the present invention to improve this kind of 
techniques. In fact, costs and workmanship are reduced so as coatings become  
 
easier to make. Until now in fact operators, to realise a process, had to make a series of actions, 
partially automatic, in which they had to reload lens or substrates on 
many and different looms, and then effect cleaning processes, layout of resins 
processes, drying processes, and so on. All these operations requested, additionally, the intervention of aspirant 
hoods. In fact the operator was exposed to solvents and resins vapours which 
are noxious, as known. In the last years there was the trend to realise optical components by plastic 
materials, for example CR39, known to the skilled in the art, greatly destined 
to the ophthalmic. In addition optical components in plastic material were 
going to be diffused in commercial and Scientific sectors. However optical components in plastic material involved not negligible inconveniences, 
for ex.: 
Insufficient superficial hardness, which makes the substrate surface 
vulnerable to the abrasions with subsequent implication of the transparency; Sensibility to the heat which strongly decreases the use in technological 
processes for optical and thin films coatings. Dilatation coefficient which is greater in respect with that in
