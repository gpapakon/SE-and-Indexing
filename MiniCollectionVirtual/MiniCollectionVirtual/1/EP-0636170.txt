<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a viscoelastic, thixotropic, 
liquid automatic dishwashing detergent composition which is 
substantially free of chlorine bleach and silicate. The automatic 
dishwashing composition contains enzyme, an enzyme stabilizing 
system, and detergent builder. It has a 
product pH between greater than 9 and 11 such that the diluted pH of 1% aqueous solution of said composition is also greater than 9. Because of their convenience, dispensing characteristics and 
aesthetics, liquid and/or gel automatic dishwashing detergent 
compositions are becoming an increasingly popular alternative to 
granular compositions among consumers. However, liquid and/or gel 
formulations often do not deliver the same effective cleaning, 
spotting and filming performance as a granular composition. To clean effectively, liquid/gel and granular automatic 
dishwashing detergents contain chlorine bleach and have high 
alkalinity (i.e. silicate, carbonate and caustic). See, for 
example, U.S. Patents 4,116,849, Leikhim, issued September 26, 
1978, 5,064,553, Dixit et al, issued November 12, 1991 and 
4,917,812, Cilley, issued April 17, 1990. Incorporation of 
chlorine bleaches requires special processing and storage steps to 
protect detergent composition components which are subject to 
deterioration upon contact with active chlorine. Automatic 
detergent compositions have been disclosed which use enzymes in 
place of chlorine bleach, for example, U.S. Patents 4,162,987. 
Maguire et al, issued July 31, 1979, 4,101,457, Place et al, 
issued July 18, 1978 and 5,075,027, Dixit et al, issued December 
24, 1991.  
 FR-A-2,608,168 describes a detergent composition containing an enzyme stabilising system 
and the use of said detergent composition in a dishwashing method. EP-A-0,530,635, published on 10.03.93, 
describes a detergent composition of pH from 5 to 9 containing hydroxy carboxylic acid or 
salts thereof.  
 It has been found that a viscoelastic thixotropic liquid 
automatic dishwashing detergent can be formed with performance 
equal to or better than that of comparable granular products. 
Surprisingly, a low alkaline product pH (between greater than 9 and 
11) such that the diluted pH of a 1% aqueous solution of said composition is also greater than 9 liquid composition which is substantially free of chlorine and 
silicate exhibits enhanced cleaning, spotting and filming ability. 
The cleaning benefit is achieved via the presence of enzymes and 
surfactant and/or builder in the composition. Removal of
