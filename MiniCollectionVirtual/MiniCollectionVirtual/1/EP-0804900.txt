<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for detecting an incipient tumor in 
living tissue such as that of a human breast in accordance with 

differences in relative dielectric characteristics. A generator 
produces a non-ionizing electromagnetic input wave of preselected 

frequency, usually exceeding three gigahertz, and that input wave 
is used to irradiate the living tissue, being effectively focused 

into a minute, discrete volume within the tissue to develop a 
non-ionizing electromagnetic wave at that position. The 

illumination location is moved over a portion of the living 
tissue in a predetermined scanning pattern. Backscatter signal 

returns from the living tissue are collected to develop a 
backscatter return signal wave. The backscatter wave is 

processed to segregate skin tissue backscatter to develop a 
segregated backscatter wave signal; that segregated signal, in 

turn, is employed to detect any anomaly, caused by differences in 
relative dielectric characteristics, that is indicative of the 

presence of a tumor or other abnormality in the scanned living 
tissue.

<DESCRIPTION>
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death for 
women. About one out of eight or nine women are expected to 
develop tumors of the breast, and about one out of sixteen to 
twenty are expected to die prematurely from breast cancer. Mammography or other X-ray methods are currently most 
used for detection of breast cancers. However, every time a 
mammogram is taken, the patient incurs a small risk of 
having a breast tumor induced by the ionizing radiation 
properties of the X-rays used during the mammogram. Also, 
the process is costly and sometimes imprecise. Accordingly, 
the National Cancer Institute has not recommended mammograms 
for women under fifty years of age, who are not as likely to 
develop breast cancers as are older women. However, while 
only about twenty two percent of breast cancers occur in 
women under fifty, data suggests that breast cancer is more 
aggressive in pre-menopausal women. Furthermore, women under  
 
forty are getting the disease in increasing numbers--about 
eleven thousand annually now--and no one knows why. Mammograms require interpretation by radiologists. One 
radiologist has said "I generally can spot cancers between 
five and ten millimeters in diameter. The prognosis is 
excellent then." However, about ten to fifteen percent of 
tumors of this size are not detected. One study showed major 
clinical disagreements for about one-third of the same 
mammograms that were interpreted by a group of radiologists. 
Further, many women find that undergoing a mammogram is a 
decidedly painful experience. Thus, alternative methods to detect breast cancers are 
needed, especially non-invasive methods that do not entail 
added risks, that can detect tumors as small as two 
millimeters in diameter, that are not unduly unpleasant to 
the patient, and that can be used for early detection. Such 
a screening system is needed because extensive studies have 
demonstrated that early detection of small breast tumors 
leads to the most effective treatment. While X-ray 
mammography can detect lesions of approximately five mm or 
larger, the accuracy may range between 30% and 75%, depending 
on the skill of the diagnostic radiologist. Repeated X-ray 
examinations, however, are not encouraged because these may 
become carcinogenic. These considerations, in addition to 
cost considerations, have led physicians to recommend that  
 
women wait until the age of fifty before having routine 
mammograms. One solution would be a non-ionizing, non-invasive, and 
low cost detection or
