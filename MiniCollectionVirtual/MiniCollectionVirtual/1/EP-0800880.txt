<ABSTRACT>
Metal strip is cast from a casting pool of 
molten metal supported above the nip between a pair of 

chilled casting rolls (16). The casting pool is 
confined by refractory plates (56) engaging the ends of 

the rolls (16). Molten metal in the casting pool in the 
vicinity of the end closures (56) is subjected to 

electromagnetic induction heating by passing electric 
current through electrical conductors (101) disposed 

outside the refractory plates (56). Each conductor 
(101) is in the form of a trapezium shaped loop of metal 

tube having wide top segment (107) and narrow bottom 
segment (108) connected by downwardly convergent side 

segments (109) aligned with roll edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the casting of metal
strip. It has particular but not exclusive application
to the casting of ferrous metal strip.It is known to cast metal strip by continuous
casting in a twin roll caster. Molten metal is
introduced between a pair of contra-rotated horizontal
casting rolls which are cooled so that metal shells
solidify on the moving roll surfaces and are brought
together at the nip between them to produce a solidified
strip product delivered downwardly from the nip between
the rolls. The term "nip" is used herein to refer to
the general region at which the rolls are closest
together. The molten metal may be poured from a ladle
into a smaller vessel from which it flows through a
metal delivery nozzle located above the nip so as to
direct it into the nip between the rolls, so forming a
casting pool of molten metal supported on the casting
surfaces of the rolls immediately above the nip. This
casting pool may be confined between side plates or dams
held in sliding engagement with the ends of the rolls.Although twin roll casting has been applied with
some success to non-ferrous metals which solidify
rapidly on cooling, there have been problems in applying
the technique to the casting of ferrous metals which
have high solidification temperatures and tend to
produce defects caused by uneven solidification at the
chilled casting surfaces of the rolls. Much attention
has therefore been given to the design of metal delivery
nozzles aimed at producing a smooth even flow of metal
to and within the casting pool. United States Patents
5,178,205 and 5,238,050 both disclose arrangements in 
which the delivery nozzle extends below the surface of
the casting pool and incorporates means to reduce the
kinetic energy of the molten metal flowing downwardly
through the nozzle to a slot outlet at the submerged
bottom end of the nozzle. In the arrangement disclosed
in US Specification 5,178,205 the kinetic energy is
reduced by a flow diffuser having a multiplicity of flow
passages and a baffle located above the diffuser. Below
the diffuser the molten metal moves slowly and evenly
out through the outlet slot into the casting pool with
minimum disturbance. In the arrangement disclosed in US
Specification 5,238,050 streams of molten metal are
allowed to fall so as to impinge on a sloping side wall
surface of the nozzle at an acute angle of impingement
so that the metal adheres to the side wall surface to
form a flowing sheet which is directed into an outlet
flow passage. Again the aim

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for casting metal strip comprising a
pair of parallel casting rolls (16) forming a nip between

them, an elongate metal delivery nozzle (19) disposed above
and extending along the nip between the casting rolls (16)

for delivery of molten metal into the nip to form a casting
pool (68) of molten metal supported above the nip, and a

pair of pool confining end closure plates (56) disposed one
at each end of the pair of casting rolls (16), wherein the

metal delivery nozzle (19) has a series of side openings
(64) along each of its longitudinal sides for flow of

molten metal from the delivery nozzle (19) in two mutually
oppositely directed series of jet streams to impinge

directly on the casting surfaces of the rolls (16) in the
vicinity of the casting pool surface, and there is a pair

of electrical conductors (101) disposed one outside each of
the end closure plates (56) and electrical supply means to

supply electrical current to the electrical conductors
(101) characterised in that the end closure plates (56) are

formed of electrically non-conducting material and each
conductor (101) is in the form of a single loop comprising

a horizontal top segment (107) to extend across an upper
portion of the respective end closure plate (56) so as in

use of the apparatus to be generally at the level of the
casting pool surface and a horizontal bottom segment (108)

shorter than the upper segment (107) and connected to the
upper segment (107) by a pair of downwardly convergent side

segments (109), the bottom segment (108) being spaced above
the level of the nip, whereby said conductors (101) are

effective to cause induction heating of molten metal in tho
casting pool in the vicinity of said end closure plates

(56) and the pool surface without causing melting of
solidified metal at the nip.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, further
characterised in that each conductor loop is positioned so

as not to extend below the upper two thirds of the pool
depth. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
further characterised in that the side segments (109) of

each loop are curved to follow the conjunctions between the
respective end closure plates (56) and the casting rolls

(16).
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
further characterised in that the bottom segment of the

coil is no more than about 70 mm below the level of the
pool surface.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4,
further characterised in that each loop is 
formed as a
single trapezium shaped loop of a hollow metal tube and

there is cooling means to circulate cooling fluid through
the tube.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5,
further characterised in that the electrical supply means

is such as to supply alternating electric current at a

Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3,
further characterised in that the end closure plates (56)

are held in plate holders (82) connected to piston rods

electrical conductors are spaced above the piston rods.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 7, further
characterised in that the plate holders (82) are pivotally

connected to the piston rods (84) of the cylinder units
(83) to allow tilting movements of the end closure plates

(56) and the electrical conductors (101) are fixed relative
to the piston rods (84) so as not to interfere with such

tilting movements of the plates (56).
