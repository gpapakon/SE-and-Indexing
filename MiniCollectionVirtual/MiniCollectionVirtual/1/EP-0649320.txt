Syringe which is unusable after a first injection,
comprising a body (1) in which a piston body (3) moves up and

down, cooperating with a piston head (2), said syringe body (1)
comprising an excess thickness of material forming a ring (4) in

the inner cylinder of the body (1) at a distance close to the
outlet point for the liquid to be injected and a second excess

thickness of material forming a ring (5) in the inner cylinder
of the body (1) at a position close to the outlet of the piston

from the syringe, a male/female assembly device being disposed

between the head of the piston (2) and the body of the piston
(3), the diameter of the piston body (3) corresponding

substantially to the inner diameter of the syringe, the excess
thickness forming the ring (4) placed at a distance very close

to the outlet point of the liquid to be injected cooperating with
the assembly device and causing the definitive and irreversible

abandonment of the piston head (2) in the body (1) of the syringe
at the time of the return of the piston body (3), the excess

thickness forming the ring (5) guaranteeing the non-withdrawal
of the piston body (3) from the syringe body (1) in order to

destroy the male/female assembly device, characterised in that
said assembly device is composed of a member integral with the

piston head of substantially reduced diameter, the latter not
being in contact with the wall of the syringe body (1), this part

integral with the piston head (2) constituting the male/female
connection, this male/female connection comprising as the male

part, a truncated member with a cut-out front face forming an
integral part of the piston body (3), whereas the corresponding

female part comprises a cavity symmetrical with this male part
but opposed so that the male part may easily be withdrawn from

the female part but cannot be re-introduced, this female part
being an integral part of the head (2).
Syringe according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
body (1) has an excess thickness forming a non-return stop (4)

and an excess thickness forming a safety stop (5). 
Syringe according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
assembly device comprises, on the one hand on the head of the

piston (2), at the level of its base, a female assembly composed
of a split cylindrical cavity (6), the slot serving to cause the

elasticity of the female housing, and on the other hand, at the
level of the end of the piston (3), a truncated cylinder (7)

cooperating at the level of the cylindrical cavity (6), the
truncated part preventng re-assembly after a first disassembly.
Syringe according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
assembly device comprises, on the one hand on the head of the

piston (2), at the level of its base, a female assembly of split
trapezoidal shape (8), the slot serving to cause the elasticity

of the female housing, and on the other hand, at the level of the
end of the piston (3), a trapezoidal male member (9).
