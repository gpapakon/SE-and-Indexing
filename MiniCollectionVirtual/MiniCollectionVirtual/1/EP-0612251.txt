<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stabilised immunoglobulin composition comprising at least one immunoglobulin together with a stabilising amount of a chelator of copper ions such as EDTA or citrate. Preferably the immunoglobulin is an antibody, for example a recombinant CDR-grafted antibody against the CDw52 antigen, most preferably CAMPATH-1H. The invention also relates to a process for enhancing the stability of an immunoglobulin which comprises subjecting the immunoglobulin to a purification procedure capable of removing copper ions therefrom. Preferably the immunoglobulin is rendered substantially free from detectable copper ions, for example on atomic absorption spectroscopy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the stabilisation of 
IgG1 immunoglobulins against degradation, in particular on 
storage and processing prior to use. Antibodies or immunoglobulins are proteinaceous 
bifunctional molecules. One part, which is highly variable 
between different antibodies, is responsible for binding to 
an antigen, for example the many different infectious 
agents that the body may encounter, whilst the second, 
constant, part is responsible for binding to the Fc 
receptors of cells and also activates complement. In this 
way, antibodies represent a vital component of the immune 
response of mammals in destroying foreign microorganisms 
and viruses. The immunisation of an animal with an antigen results 
in the production of different antibodies with different 
specificities and affinities. An antiserum obtained from 
the immunised animal will, therefore, be heterogeneous and 
contain a pool of antibodies produced by many different 
lymphocyte clones. Antibodies thus obtained are referred 
to as polyclonal antibodies and this polyclonal nature has 
been a major drawback in the use of antibodies in 
diagnostic assays and in therapeutic applications. A major step forward occurred in 1975 when Kohler and 
Milstein (Nature, 1975, 256, 495-497) reported the 
successful fusion of spleen cells from mice immunized with 
an antigen with cells of a murine myeloma line. The 
resulting hybrid cells, termed hybridomas, have the 
properties of antibody production derived from spleen cells 
and of continuous growth derived from the myeloma cells. 
Each hybridoma synthesizes and secretes a single antibody 
to a particular determinant of the original antigen. To 
ensure that all cells in a culture are identical, i.e. that 
they contain the genetic information required for the  
 
synthesis of a unique antibody species, the hybridomas 
resulting from cell fusion are cloned and subcloned. In 
this way, the cloned hybridomas produce homogeneous or 
monoclonal antibodies. The advantages of hybridoma technology are profound. 
Because many hybrids arising from each spleen are screened 
for their potential to produce antibodies to the antigen of 
interest and only a few are selected, it is possible to 
immunize with impure antigens and yet obtain specific 
antibodies. The immortality of the cell line assures that 
an unlimited supply of a homogeneous, well-characterised 
antibody is available for use in a variety of applications 
including in particular diagnosis and immunotherapy of 
pathological disorders.
