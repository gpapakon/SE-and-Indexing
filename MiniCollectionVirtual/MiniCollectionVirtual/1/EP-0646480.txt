<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatic tires which are designed to reduce noise 
together with retaining good drainage performance and 

good cornering performance. 
The pneumatic tire has outside a radial carcass (2) 
comprising at least one ply, a belt (3) comprising at 

least two rubber coated layers laminated with cross cord 
arrangement, at least one belt reinforcing layer (4) 

comprising a rubber coated layer of cords extending 
substantially in parallel with the circumference of the 

tire, and a tread (5) reinforced by the belt (3) and the 
belt reinforcing layer (4), characterized in that the 

tread (5) has one circumferential wide groove (6) 
extending along the tire circumference and having a 

sectional area of not less than 160 mmÂ², and the 
circumferential wide groove is arranged to be offset 

from the tire equatorial plane (8) in the widthwise 
direction of the tire by a distance (L) of 1/30 - 1/10 

of the tire grounding width (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pneumatic tires, and in 
particular relates to a pneumatic tire which is designed 
to reduce noise while retaining good drainage 
performance and good cornering performance, by 
optimizing the sectional area and position of a 
circumferential wide groove arranged in the tire tread. A pneumatic tire generally has a tread pattern provided 
with circumferential grooves and lateral grooves in the 
tread in order to satisfy drainage performance and 
cornering performance. In particular, the 
circumferential grooves are effective during running on 
a wet road surface because they have a function of 
draining water entering the grounding region (ground 
contact region) rearward rapidly. As a result of the provision of the circumferential 
grooves, however, noise by air column resonance arises 
which is easily caused by the compressed air, which is 
compressed in the tube-like space between the 
circumferential grooves in the tread and a road surface, 
flowing suddenly through the circumferential grooves by 
intermittent pumping effect. It is an object of the present invention to provide a  
 
pneumatic tire which is designed to reduce noise while 
retaining good drainage performance and good cornering 
performance, by optimizing the sectional area and the 
position of a circumferential wide groove arranged in 
the tire tread. According to the invention, there is provided a 
pneumatic tire having successively outside a radial 
carcass comprising at least one ply, a belt comprising 
at least two rubber coated layers laminated with cross 
cord arrangement, at least one belt reinforcing layer 
comprising a rubber coated layer of cords extending 
substantially in parallel with the circumference of the 
tire, and a tread reinforced by the belt and the belt 
reinforcing layer, characterized in that the tread has 
one circumferential wide groove extending along the tire 
circumference and having a sectional area of not less 
than 160 mm2, and said circumferential wide groove 
is arranged to be offset from the tire equatorial plane 
in the widthwise direction of the tire by a distance of 
1/30 - 1/10 of the tire grounding width. Further, it is preferable that said circumferential wide 
groove is arranged to be offset in the inward direction 
of a vehicle from the tire equatorial plane viewing the 
tire mounted on a vehicle.  
 The invention will be further described, by way of 
example only, with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which:
