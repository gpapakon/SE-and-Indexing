Adjustable-height support for shuttering in the 
building trade, in particular a ceiling support (1) 

comprising an outer tube (2) within which an inner 
tube (3) is guided in a displaceable fashion, the 

position of the inner tube (3) can be fixed with 
respect to the outer tube (2) in a detachable fashion 

and with a measurement scale (9) arranged on the 
outer periphery (10) in the longitudinal direction 

along at least portions of the inner tube (3),
 
characterized in that the measurement scale is a tape 

measure which seats in a groove (36) provided in the 
inner tube (33). 
Adjustable-height support according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the measuring scale is attached 

to the inner tube (23; 33) in an exchangeable 
fashion, particularly, in the form of a tape measure. 
Adjustable-height support according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the measuring scale (9; 19; 29) 

is coated with a material which is weather-resistant 
and scratch-resistant. 
Adjustable-height support according to any of the 
claims 1 through 3, characterized in that the 

measuring scale (9) is configured as a fluorescent 
measuring scale.  

 
Adjustable-height support according to any of the 
claims 1 through 4, characterized in that the 

measurement scale (9; 19; 29) is arranged a plurality 
of times about the periphery of the inner tube (3; 

13; 23; 33) extending in the longitudinal direction 
of the inner tube (3; 13; 23; 33).
