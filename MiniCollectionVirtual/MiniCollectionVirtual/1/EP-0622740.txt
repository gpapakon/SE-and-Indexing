<ABSTRACT>
A character set translator (10) that facilitates the 
communication of data between computers utilizing 

different character sets. The computer (16) that utilizes 
one character set and is transmitting data to a remote 

terminal (32) that utilizes another character set can 
invoke the character set translator (10) to convert the 

data from the original character set to an extended 
character set (50) that contains characters from around 

the world. The data is then translated into the character 
set that is appropriate for the remote terminal (32). 

Therefore the remote terminal (32) receives a data file 
encoded in its character set. Likewise, if data is 

transmitted from a terminal using one character set, the 
character set translator can receive the data and convert 

the data into the character set appropriate for the 
computer or application receiving the data. Look-up 

tables (60) and (62) are utilized to convert the data 
between character sets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of data 
communications, and more particularly, describes a 
character set translator that facilitates the transfer of 
data between computers that normally use different 
character sets, such as those in different countries. In the late 1950's, when digital computing 
machines were first becoming somewhat commonplace, 
it occurred to those working with computers that it 
would be desirable to construct an arrangement whereby 
computers could communicate with each other and 
whereby operators at a remote operator location could 
communicate with a distant computer. Today, 
computers are located throughout the world and users of 
these computers desire to be interconnected.  Just as with individuals, a fundamental problem 
with communication across country boundaries is 
language. Generally speaking, each data 
communications code utilizes 256 symbols. The 
conventional use of 256 characters in a character set 
comes from the fact that 256 distinct symbols is 
adequate to cover the alphabets of most alphabetic 
written languages, an appropriate set of punctuation, a 
set of Arabic numerals, and some standard control codes 
to be used in certain data communications applications, 
and still have some additional symbols left over for 
simple graphic characters that can be used to generate a 
pleasing text mode display. In the vernacular of this 
specification, each encoded symbol is referred to as a 
character. It should be understood that this includes 
certain distinct control codes, all referred to as "control 
characters" within a defined computer code. A computing device engaged in serial data 
communications merely collects incoming bits and 8 bit 
asynchronous characters and forwards them onto the 
application that is driving the communications function. 
It is up to the programmer to determine the particular 
coded significance of each 8 bit binary number that is 
received as an asynchronous character. Also it should 
be understood that each one to one assignment of the 8 
bit binary numbers between 0 and 255 to a particular 
symbol or control function is a predetermined computer 
code or a predetermined character set. In the United 
States, United States - 437 character set has become very 
popular in the last decade as a result of its use in the 
IBM PC and the prodigy of that family of computer. 
Those skilled in the art will recognize United States - 
437 character set as a super set of the American 
Standard Code Information Interchange, which defines

<CLAIMS>
In a computer network in which one 
computer (16) is connected to a second computer (32), 

and wherein said computers utilize first and second 
character sets (52) and (56) at least one of said 

computers having a character set translator, the 
improvement in said character set translator being 

characterized by an extended character set (50) that 
includes indexed versions of said first and said second 

character sets, a first look-up table (60) that converts 
data between said first character set (52) and said 

extended character set (50) and a second look-up table 
(62) that converts data between said extended character 

set (50) and said second character set (56). 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said data is 
transmitted from a computer (16) that uses said first 

standard character set and received by a computer (32) 
that uses said standard second character set, and said 

translations of data occur after said data is received by 
said computer (32) that uses said second standard 

character set. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said data is 
transmitted from a computer (16) that uses said first 

standard character set and received by a computer (32) 
that uses said second standard character set, and said 

translations of data occur before said data is transmitted 
by said computer (16) that uses said first standard 

character set. 
The method of Claim 1 wherein said 
extended character set (50) utilizes two bytes of data to 

identify each character, one byte of data being a subset 
number within said extended character set (50) and the 

second byte of data being an offset into the subset within 
said extended character set (50). 
A method for translating data coming into a 
computer encoded in a first standard character set into a 

second standard character set, comprising the step of 
identifying the first standard character set used to 

encode the incoming data and the second standard 
character set to which the data will be converted, the 

improvement in the method for translating data 
comprising the steps of translating said incoming data 

from said first standard character to an extended 
character set, said extended character set including said 

first standard character set and said second standard 
character set and translating said data translated into said 

extended character set from said extended character set 
to said second standard character set. 
The method of Claim 5 wherein said 
translation steps are performed using two separate look-up 

tables, said incoming data characters being used to 
address a first look-up table and said first look-up table 

outputting stored characters from the extended character 
set that correspond to said incoming data characters, 

thereby performing the translation of said incoming data 
from said first standard character set to an extended 

character set and said first look-up table output being 
used to address a second look-up table and said second 

look-up table outputting stored characters from said 
second standard character set that correspond to said 

incoming data characters, thereby performing the 
translation of said data from said extended character set 

to said second character set. 
The method of Claim 5 wherein characters 
from said first standard character set which are not in 

said second standard character set are approximated 
using similar characters from said second standard 

character set.
