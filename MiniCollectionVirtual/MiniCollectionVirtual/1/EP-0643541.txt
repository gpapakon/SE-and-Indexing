<ABSTRACT>
A high-speed information service system is provided which uses a unique identifier 
received during call setup to retrieve automatically a personalized profile for an information 

service subscriber. The identifier uniquely identifies the subscriber, thereby allowing the 
information retrieval process to begin immediately after the call is setup. The system utilizes 

Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) signaling and temporary, "out-of-band" signaling 
to improve information retrieval capability. ISDN signaling permits electronic addressing of 

information requested by the subscriber, thereby eliminating the delays which accompany 
DTMF signal processing. Communications between an information service provider and an 

individual information source are conducted using out-of-band signaling. That is, call setup 
and information request are processed using a channel other than the channel which carries 

data between the information service provider, the information source and the subscriber.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to information services systems and, more particularly, to
information services systems which process information requests received via telephone lines.Currently available information services systems permit a subscriber to the service to
obtain information about subscriber-selected topics, such as weather, sports, and stock prices.
Several systems enable the subscriber to access the desired information in real-time, via
telephone lines. Typically, the subscriber requests information by entering keystrokes from
a telephone keypad to transmit a sequence of dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) telephone
signals. The DTMF tones are received at a central processor operated by an information
service provider. The information service provider then places one or more telephone calls
to various information sources, also via DTMF signaling, to obtain the requested information.
The information service provider then transmits the requested information back to the
subscriber.Existing information retrieval systems, however, suffer several performance
disadvantages. In particular, the subscriber must endure long delays while the information
service provider obtains information from the subscriber prior to obtaining the requested
information from the information sources. The information retrieval process is slow because
the information service provider must first verify the subscriber's identity and receive
instructions specifying information to be retrieved for the subscriber. For example, the 
subscriber must often enter an authorisation code prior to gaining access to the
information retrieval system.
"Nachrichten Technische Zeitschrift", Vol. 45, No 4, pp254-261 (1992) is a general
review of the "intelligent net". It contains speculation about future developments that
might be made possible by the "intelligent net", and refers to the possibility of
providing "personalised services". It also speculates that the "personalised services"
will allow a personalised identity to be used.No details of what the "personalised services" could consist of are given, and
there is no disclosure as to how the personalised identity feature might be used in
practice.WO 91/16779 discloses an information retrieval service. Once a caller has
been connected to the service, the caller is initially required to enter an initial
command to gain access to an audio news and information service. Once the caller
has selected the news and information service by entering an appropriate signal via
their telephone keypad, the

<CLAIMS>
A method for use with an information service system (106) that provides
different types of information to a subscriber (100) in response to an information

services request telephone call placed by the subscriber (100) through a
telecommunications network (104), the method

comprising the step of:

storing a record in accordance with a subscriber's personal preference that
identifies pre-selected types of information to be provided to the subscriber;

   and 
characterized by
 the steps of :

establishing, in the telecommunications network, the identity of the subscriber
who initiated an information services request telephone call by dialling a telephone

number uniquely assigned to the subscriber, the identity of the subscriber determined
from the subscriber's unique telephone number;
correlating the identity of the subscriber, as established from the subscriber's
unique telephone number, with a corresponding stored record (202) to establish the

personal preference of the subscriber initiating the information services request
telephone call before completing set up of the call initiated by the subscriber to the

information services system; and
completing set up of the call initiated by the subscriber to the information
services system (106) after the subscriber' s personal preference has been established

to enable the subscriber to receive information in accordance with the subscriber's
personal preference.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the record is stored in the information
services system.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the information corresponding to the
subscriber's personal preference is automatically retrieved upon completion of set up

of the call initiated by the subscriber to the information services system.
