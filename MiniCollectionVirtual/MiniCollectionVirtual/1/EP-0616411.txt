<ABSTRACT>
In order to charge a battery rapidly, a high current is injected into this battery while at the same time monitoring the voltage at the terminals of this battery. This injection is stopped when this voltage undergoes an inflexion (I) in its variation. It may be shown that, given the safety of the system, it is possible to charge batteries of the Nickel/Cadmium or Nickel/Metal-Hydride type with even greater currents than for the previous systems.

Method for rapidly recharging a battery, including the 
following phases: 


the battery to be charged is subjected to a high charging 
current, 
the charging voltage of the battery is measured during this 
charging, and a first measurement signal (yn) is obtained, 
a second measurement signal (dn) representing the variation 
in the charging voltage is generated by calculating the 

difference between two samples of the first signal a 
predetermined period apart, 
it is determined that the charge is nominal by detecting the 
moment when the variation (dn) in the voltage measured over a 

period becomes smaller than a variation in voltage measured 
during a preceding period, and 
the charging of this battery is halted when this charge is 
nominal,
 
characterised in that, in order to determine that the voltage 

measured over a period is beginning to rise less quickly than 
over a preceding period, 
the second measurement signal is damped a first time and a 
third measurement signal (zn) is obtained, 
the third signal is damped and a fourth measurement signal 
(wn) is obtained, 
a determination that the charge is nominal is authorised 
when the ratio between the first signal and the fourth signal  

 
is higher than a given value, for example 1:25, 
the instant when the third signal passes through an extreme 
is detected, and 
the said moment is, consequently, detected if the 
authorisation has been given. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that, in 
order to determine that the voltage measured over a period 

begins to rise less quickly than during a preceding period, 

a certain number of periods (T) are awaited before this 
determination is authorised. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 2, characterised in 
that 


the battery is charged with a rigorously constant current. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that 


the charging voltage of the battery is measured periodically 
(H). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that 


it is determined that the charge is nominal at a moment 
which is retarded (C) with respect to the detected moment (I). 
Integrated circuit provided with circuits and connections 
for measuring and controlling the rapid charging of a battery, 

having a microprocessor (13) connected to a program memory 
(16), the integrated circuit comprising inputs for measuring 

the charging voltage of the battery and an output producing a  
 

charge stop signal, characterised in that the program 
contained in this program memory includes instructions 

corresponding to all the steps in the method according to any 
one of Claims 1 to 5. 
Circuit according to Claim 6, characterised in that it 
includes an analogue to digital converter (9) for converting 

the value of the voltage of the battery to a binary signal. 
Circuit according to Claim 6 or Claim 7, characterised in 
that it includes an adjustable stable current generator of the 

LM 317 type.
