<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to greases comprising 
methylfluoroalkylsiloxanes and solid thickeners containing 
fluorinated polymers which have excellent lubricating 
properties. Greases incorporating certain fluorosilicone 
polymers are known in the art and several are commercially 
available. For instance, greases containing poly-3,3,3-trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane 
thickened with polytetrafluoroethylene 
are commercially available from a variety of 
sources. Greases containing fluorosilicones with more than 1 
perfluorinated carbon atom are also known in the art. For 
instance, U.S. Patent No. 3,061,545 teaches greases 
containing fluorosilicones having repeating units of the 
structure RCH₂CH₂R'SiO in which R is a perfluoroalkyl radical 
of 1 to 10 carbon atoms and R' is a monovalent hydrocarbon 
radical of less than 3 carbon atoms. This reference, 
however, does not teach fluorinated polymer thickeners. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,642,626 describes a 
grease containing a fluorosilicone polymer thickened with a 
perfluoropropylenetetrafluoroethylene copolymer. This 
reference, however, requires the addition of an antimony 
dialkyl dithiocarbamate. The present inventors have now found that the 
greases claimed herein have unexpected lubricating and 
antiwear properties. The present invention relates to a grease 
composition comprising between 55 and 90 weight percent of a 
methylfluoroalkylsiloxane of the structure  having an average viscosity in the range of from 0.0001 to 
0.015 m²/s, wherein Rf is a perfluoroalkyl group containing 2 
to 8 carbon atoms, n is 2 or 3 and the value of x for the 
components of the average mixture is between 4 and 200. The 
grease also contains between 10 and 45 weight percent of a 
solid thickener comprising a fluorinated polymer, provided 
the fluorinated polymer is not a perfluorpropenetetrafluoroethylene 
copolymer. The present invention is based on our unexpected 
finding that greases containing methylfluoroalkylsiloxanes 
having perfluoroalkyl radicals of 2-8 carbon atoms and 
thickeners containing fluorinated polymers provide improved 
lubricating properties. The methylfluoroalkylsiloxanes of the present 
invention have the structure: 
In this structure, Rf is a perfluoroalkyl group containing 2 
to 8, preferably 4-6, carbon atoms. n is 2 or 3 with n=2 
being preferred. Finally, this material comprises a mixture 
of polymers in which the average value of x is between 4 and 
200 with x=10-100 being preferred. These methylfluoroalkylsiloxanes are generally 
liquid
