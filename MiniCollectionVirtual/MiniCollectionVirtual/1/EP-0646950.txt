<ABSTRACT>
A thin film (3) on a substrate (1) is patterned so as 
to include an area in which a thin film transistor is 

to be formed and an area of another patterned thin film 
or a semiconductor device (4), and so as to have a size 

larger than the total size of the areas. Next, the 
patterned thin film is annealed. After the annealing, 

a part of the inside area and the periphery (3B) 
of the patterned thin film (3) is 

patterned. The part of the thin film (3c) is used for 
forming a thin film transistor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
processing a thin film. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a thin-film processing method
which is applied to the fabrication of a thin film
transistor for a liquid crystal display, an image
sensor, a static random access memory (SRAM), or the
like.In recent years, as liquid crystal displays
have higher definition and a larger size, an increase
in production yield of a thin film transistor (hereinafter
referred to as a TFT) used as the driving element
is essentially required. This is because a driving
section of the liquid crystal display includes a large
number of TFTs. The production yield of TFTs largely
depends on the uniformity of a semiconductor thin film
which constitutes the TFTs, and especially on the
uniformity of crystallinity. In order to increase the
production yield of TFTs, it is very important to form
a thin film with superior uniformity.As a recent trend, the main semiconductor
material of a TFT is being shifted from conventional
amorphous silicon (a-Si) to polycrystalline silicon
(poly-Si). When a thin film of poly-Si is to be
formed, the key technique is the annealing (heat treatment)
for changing a-Si to poly-Si. As to the annealing,
excimer laser annealing which causes no damage to
an inexpensive glass substrate having a low deforming 
point, and low-temperature annealing (at temperatures
equal to or lower than about 600°C) such as solid phase
crystallization are considered as promising methods.Hereinafter, a thin-film processing method
used in a fabrication process of a conventional poly-Si
TFT will be described Figures 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B are
plan views of an area in which TFTs are to be formed
and the cross-sectional views thereof in the course
of the process steps in a prior art example A. Figures
3A, 3B, 4A, and 4B are plan views of an area in which
TFTs are to be formed and the cross-sectional views
thereof in course of the process steps in a prior art
example B.As is shown in Figures 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, in
the prior art example A, the patterning of a semiconductor
thin film on a substrate 1 is first performed,
so as to form an area 2b in which a TFT is to be
formed. Then, the area 2b is irradiated with an excimer
laser beam for heating the area 2b. As a result,
the area 2b is crystallized (annealed), as to form so
an area 3c. Herein, the area 3c is used as a semiconductor
layer for a TFT.In the prior art example B shown in Figures
3A, 3B, 4A and 4B, a semiconductor thin film of a
substrate 1 (in this case, the
