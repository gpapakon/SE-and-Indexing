<ABSTRACT>
Submicron device fabrication entailing ringfield x-ray pattern 
delineation is facilitated by use of a condenser including a faceted 

collector lens. 
The collector lens is constituted of paired facets (33), symmetrically 

placed about an axis 
of a laser-pumped plasma source (31). Each of the members of a pair 

produce an image 
of the entire illumination field so that inhomogeneities in 

illumination intensity are 
compensated within each composite image as produced by a particular pair.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fabrication of devices built to submicron design
rules
and in particular to a process as described in the
first part of claim 1. Such a process is known from
EP-A-0 523 303 which will be discussed later.
Plasma-derived x-ray radiation serves for pattern delineation for small
features considered unattainable by use of longer wavelength electromagnetic
radiation. The plasma source is matched to a projection camera operating in a
ringfield scanning mode. Very Large Scale Integration ("VLSI") is a prime
objective.State-of-the art VLSI is a 16 megabit chip with circuitry built to design
rules of 0.5µm. Effort directed to further miniaturization takes the initial form of
more fully utilizing resolution capability of presently-used ultraviolet ("UV")
delineating radiation. "Deep" UV (λ = 0.3µm - 0.1µm), with techniques such as
phase masking, off-axis illumination, and step-and-repeat may permit design rules
(minimum feature or space dimension) of 0. 25µm or slightly smaller.At still smaller design rules, a different form of delineating radiation is
required to avoid wavelength-related resolution limits. An extensive effort depends
on electron or other charged-particle radiation. Use of electromagnetic radiation for
this purpose will require x-ray wavelengths.Two x-ray radiation sources are under consideration. The first, the
electron storage ring synchrotron, has been used for many years and is at advanced
stage of development. Electrons, accelerated to relativistic velocity, in following
their magnetic-field-constrained orbit, emit x-ray radiation. Radiation, in the
wavelength range of consequence for lithography, is reliably produced. The
synchrotron produces precisely defined radiation to meet the demands of extremely
sophisticated experimentation but is a large, very costly piece of apparatus.Plasma x-ray sources are less costly. These depend upon a high power,
pulsed laser - e.g. an yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser, or an excimer laser,
delivering 500-1,000 W (watts) of power to a 50µm-250µm spot, thereby heating a
source material to e.g. 250,000°C, to emit x-ray radiation from the resulting plasma.
Plasma sources are compact, and may be dedicated to a single production line (so
that malfunction does not close down the entire plant). A variety of x-ray patterning approaches are under study. Probably the
most developed is proximity printing. In this approach 1:1 imaging is produced
much in the manner of photographic contact printing. A fine-membrane mask is
maintained at one or

Process for fabrication of a device comprising at least one element of
least dimension ≤0.25µm, such process comprising construction of a plurality of

successive levels, each level entailing lithographic delineation, in accordance with
which a subject mask pattern is imaged on an image plane, ultimately to result in

removal of or addition of material in delineated regions, at least one such level

emission (32) from the plasma is collected by a collector lens (41a,41b)
including at least four paired mirror facets (41a,41b) in which members of each pair

(41a,41b) are symmetrically disposed about an axis of the source (40) and in which
paired members individually produce complementary images of the entirety of an

illumination field, whereby paired members together produce an evenly illuminated
compensated field and the entire illumination field is of an intensity which is the sum

of all facet-produced image fields,
and in that the collector lens is the first lens of a condenser which
includes at least one processing lens (82) which contributes to shaping of the

illumination field into the arc-shaped form required for ringfield projection.
Process of claim 1, in which the condenser includes a first processing
lens which is facted, in which the number of facets in the first processing lens is

equal to the number of facets in the collector lens, and in which images yielded by
collector lens facets are incident upon individual dedicated facets of the first

processing lens.

Process of claim 12, in which an adjustable real aperture is
positioned immediately subsequent to a first processing lens.
