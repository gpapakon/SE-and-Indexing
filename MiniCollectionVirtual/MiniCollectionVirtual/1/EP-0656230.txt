<ABSTRACT>
An aerosol generator (10) includes a plate (18) defining 
an orifice (20) through which a jet of liquid is 

projected, which breaks up into droplets. The plate (18) 
is vibrated to control the droplet size, and the size 

distribution. The droplet size distribution is 
monitored, and this information is used to control the 

vibration to ensure the droplets are monodisperse and of 
the correct size. This can be achieved as follows: the 

droplets are diverted by a transverse air stream, and an 
optical image is obtained of the diverted jet (28) onto a 

linear array of photodetectors (34). The signals from 
the photodetectors represent the particle size 

distribution, and are supplied as input to a computer 
(36) whose output is used to control the vibration of the 

plate (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aerosol generator,
particularly but not exclusively to a generator of
substantially monodisperse aerosol particles, and to a
method of making an aerosol using such a generator.Monodisperse aerosols of known particle size are
used for a variety of purposes including the calibration
of particle sizing instruments, and the testing of
particle trapping equipment. The term particle in this
context should be taken to encompass both solid particles
and liquid droplets. A generator suitable for making
substantially monodisperse test particles is the
vibrating orifice aerosol generator, in which a jet of
liquid is formed by passing liquid through an orifice in
a plate and the plate is vibrated. Even without the
vibration, the jet, initially a column of liquid, would
be unstable as any variations in diameter cause it to
break up to form a jet of droplets; with a vibrating
plate a jet of droplets is formed almost instantaneously,
and if the amplitude and frequency of the vibration have
appropriate values, the droplets are monodisperse. The
size of the droplets is approximately twice the diameter
of the orifice, and can in a particular case be
calculated from the flow rate of the liquid and the
frequency. If the droplets consist of dispersion (a
solution or suspension) of material in a volatile liquid
then the droplets will dry to give particles of the
dispersed material of uniform mass, whose size also
depends on the concentration of the dispersion. One such
aerosol generator is described by L. Strom in Rev. Sci.
Inst., Vol. 40, No. 6 (June 1969) page 778. Such a
generator can be set up to provide monodisperse
particles, but in practice it is often found to go out of
tune after a period of operation of up to a few hours, 
and to start producing particles of two or more sizes.Neukermans et al (US 3 990 797) describes the use of
light diffraction to monitor the size of droplets
produced from an array of apertures. The size of the
particles determines the size of the diffraction pattern,
and the narrower the particle size distribution the
better defined is the pattern.According to the present invention there is provided
an aerosol generator comprising means to define a single
orifice, means to supply a liquid to one side of the
orifice-defining means so a jet of liquid emerges from
the orifice, and means to vibrate the orifice-defining
means, and a nozzle arranged to form a gas stream to
divert the liquid jet after it has emerged, and
characterised by means to monitor the size

<CLAIMS>
An aerosol generator (10) comprising means (18) to
define a single orifice (20), means (14) to supply a

liquid to one side of the orifice-defining means (18) so
a jet (24) of liquid emerges from the orifice (20), and

means (16) to vibrate the orifice-defining means (18),
and a nozzle (26) arranged to form a gas stream to divert

the liquid jet after it has emerged, and characterised by
means (30,32,34) to monitor the size distribution of

droplets in the jet after it has emerged, and means
(36,22) responsive to signals from the monitoring means

(34) to control the means (16) causing the vibration, the
monitoring means comprising an optical system (30, 32) to

form an image of the diverted liquid jet on a linear
array (34) of photodetectors, so the images of droplets

of different sizes fall on different parts of the array

(34), the photodetector array (34) providing the signals
to the control means (36).
An aerosol generator as claimed in Claim 1 wherein
the means to cause the vibration is a piezoelectric

vibrator (16), and the control involves adjusting either
the voltage or the frequency applied to it.
A method of generating an aerosol comprising
supplying a liquid to one side of an orifice-defining

means (18) so a single jet of the liquid emerges from the
orifice (20), vibrating the orifice-defining means (18),

and diverting the liquid jet (24) after it has emerged,
by means of a gas stream (26), and characterised by

monitoring the size distribution of droplets in the jet
(24) after it has emerged by forming an optical image

(30, 32) of the diverted liquid jet (28) on a linear
array (34) of photodetectors, so the images of droplets

of different sizes fall on different parts of the array 
(34), and in response to signals from the photodetector

array (34) controlling the means (16) causing the
vibration.
A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the liquid
supplied to the orifice is provided from two sources

differing in their concentrations of a non-volatile
material, the proportions of the liquids supplied from

the two sources being adjusted to control the
concentration of the non-volatile material in the liquid

emerging in the droplets.
A method as claimed in Claim 3 or Claim 4 also
comprising supplying a pulse of air (40) to the outer

face of the orifice-defining means (18), prior to
creation of the liquid jet, to remove any liquid which

has collected there.
