<ABSTRACT>
Process for intercritical treatment at an austenisation temperature T of a charge of pig iron. It includes the following stages:   - the said charge is heated in a furnace, according to a predetermined temperature curve, so that the curves of temperature rise of the different parts of the charge are substantially similar; - a temperature T' 
<
/= T is determined beforehand so that when the furnace is maintained at the temperature T', each part of the charge reaches but does not exceed the temperature T substantially at each moment of the period of maintaining the furnace at the temperature T'; - the temperature rise is stopped when the temperature of the furnace reaches the value T'; and - the furnace is maintained at the temperature T' for a predetermined period t;   - the charge is then cooled.
