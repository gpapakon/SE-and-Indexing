<ABSTRACT>
A simple and excellent method of regenerating a heteropolyacid-based catalyst which comprises dissolving 
and/or dispersing a heteropolyacid-based catalyst such as a phosphoromolybdic acid-based catalyst with a deteriorated 

catalyst activity in an aqueous medium and treating the solution or dispersion with an inorganic ion-exchanger such 
as a crystalline antimonic acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
regeneration of a heteropolyacid type catalyst whose activity has
been lowered.Generally, deactivation of catalysts may usually occur during
their use, for example, sudden deactivation due to an abnormal
reaction in the course of a desired reaction, slow deactivation due
to physical and/or chemical changes thereof in a long term
operation or deactivation due to moisture absorption during the
storage thereof.Heteropolyacids are used for hydrating reactions of propylene
or isobutylene and gas-phase oxidizing reactions of olefins or
aldehydes, as a catalyst having characteristic natures and
excellent functions.Among these heteropolyacids, several methods for the
regeneration of catalysts used for gas-phase catalytic reactions of
methacrolein have been proposed.For example, the methods include a method comprising treating 
with ammonia and an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution [Japanese
Patent Application Laying Open (KOKAI) No. 53-113790 (1978)], a
method comprising dissolving in ammonia or pyridine [Japanese
Patent Application Laying Open (KOKAI) No. 60-232247 (1985)], a
method comprising extracting a water soluble metal salt of
heteropolyacid with an aqueous medium and heating with molecular
oxygen [Japanese Patent Application Laying Open (KOKAI) No. 56-163755
(1981)] and a method comprising treating with steam
[Japanese patent Application Laying open (KOKAI) No. 58-156351
(1983)]. Each of the methods is characterized by supplementing
ammonia which has been volatilized during the use of catalysts or
increasing the surface area of deteriorated catalysts by the steam
treatment to recover their activity.There are, however, some problems that although the initial
activity and selectivity, for the reaction, of the catalysts
regenerated by these methods are good their lifetimes are short, or
although their lifetimes are long there is not enough recovery of
their activities. Therefore, these methods are insufficient.US-A-4 791 080 discloses a method for regenerating
heteropolyacids of molybdenum in which the spent catalyst is
oxidised with an oxygen containing gas, suitably
intertmittently, and in alternation with its application in
oxyolehydrogenation. It is an object of the invention to provide a process for the
regeneration of a heteropolyacid catalyst whose activity has been
lowered to obtain a heteropolyacid catalyst with enough activity
and a long lifetime.The inventors have taken a great effort to solve and overcome
the above-mentioned problems and
