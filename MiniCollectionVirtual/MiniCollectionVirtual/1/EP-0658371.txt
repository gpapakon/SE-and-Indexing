<ABSTRACT>
Recovery of saturated aliphatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 5 to 10 C atoms (I) and polybasic carboxylic acids of the general formula II

 in which the groups A, independently of each other, represent a C1- to C4-alkylene group and n denotes a number from 1 to 4, by electrodialysis of aqueous solutions of salts or partial salts of these carboxylic acids, by   a) carrying out the electrodialysis until approximately 90% of the carboxyl groups are present in free form, b) completely or partly separating off the carboxylic acid from the resulting solution outside the electrodialysis cell and c) adding fresh salt to the remaining solution and returning it to the electrodialysis stage.
