<ABSTRACT>
A process is claimed for mfg. a composite tube with two or more layers of different materials, at least one layer being polyethylene (PE) or crosslinked PE and another being metal. Tubes pref. comprise three layers with the metal (2) sandwiched between the plastic layers. The metal layer (2) is thin-walled and cut to suit the dia. of the inner tube (1). The metal layer (2), pref. of aluminium, is wrapped around the continuous inner tube (1) and a gas-tight weld formed between the contacting free ends. The plastic inner tube (1) acts as a bending mandrel for the metal band (2) and moves continuously and synchronously with it. Tube shape and dimensional tolerances are determined by the plastic tube (1) and therefore calibration and reducing devices are unnecessary. Exclusion of oxygen from the construction improves welding and the bond between the inner tube (1) and metal band (2). Free edges on the metal (2) are turned up by a shaping tool to form mating faces which when welded are gas tight. The free edges of the metal layer (2) are trimmed in a machine in front of the tube forming machine to ensure equal band (2) width and oxide free edges for gas welding. Turned-up edges act as stabilisers and guides for the tube during continuous prodn

A method for the production of a composite tube for the conveyance of liquid
or gaseous media in a heated or cooled condition, said composite tube

comprising at least one inner tube of a synthetic material and a metallic
tube enclosing the same, wherein


said metallic tube (2) is formed around said synthetic material tube (1)
by bending a metallic band having band edges (3) about an axis arranged

in the longitudinal direction thereof, in such a manner that, with
the metallic band formed into said metallic tube (2) and bearing closely

on said synthetic material tube (1), the band edges (3) are angled, abut
each other closely and are directed radially away from the synthetic material

tube (1),
said synthetic material tube (1) is endlessly extruded and is used as an
endlessly and synchronously following mandrel for forming said metallic

tube (2), with adhesives being extruded between the synthetic material
tube (1) and the metallic tube (2),
said band edges (3) of the metallic tube (1) are welded to each other in
a gas-tight manner, wherein said angled band edges (3) of the metallic

tube (2) are pressed against each other in during the welding, and
said adhesives are activated by thermal treatment,
characterized in

that
 said metallic band is first given an angular shape at its band edges (3)
and then, with its band edges (3) arranged at an angle, is formed around

said synthetic material tube (1), wherein said metallic band, while being
formed around said inner tube (1), is guided by its angled band edges (3).
The method according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said band edges (3)
extending in the longitudinal direction of said metallic tube (2) are angled

by use of a shaping tool to a height (H) corresponding to the thickness of
said band. 
The method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 said metallic
tube (2) is shrunk onto said synthetic material tube (1) by cooling the

welding seam.
The method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
, for
activating said adhesive and thus bonding said synthetic material tube (1)

and said metallic tube (2) to each other, the synthetic material tube (1)
and the metallic tube (2) welded along its longitudinal seam are heated

circumferentially.
