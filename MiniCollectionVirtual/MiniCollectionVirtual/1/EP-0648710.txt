<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a fine, monodisperse oxide powder of the binary oxides of one or more elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements and also lanthanides and the actinides. It further relates to a fine, monodisperse oxide powder of the binary oxides of one or more elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements and also the lanthanides and actinides, a ceramic composition containing such a fine, monodisperse oxide powder and the use thereof for producing electronic components or ceramic pastes. Fine, monodisperse oxide powders can be prepared without complicated manufacturing plants by a process in which   - a graphite intercalation compound is prepared by reaction of one or more chemical starting compounds of one or more of the elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements and also the lanthanides and actinides with a graphitic carbon modification having a particle size 
<
/= 150  mu m (sieve fraction), and - the graphite intercalation compound is converted by means of an oxidising agent to the binary oxide of one or more of the elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements and also lanthanides and the actinides.

A method of manufacturing a fine, monodisperse oxide powder of the
binary oxides of one or more elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb,

Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the periodic system as well as of the lanthanides and
actinides, in which


a graphite intercalation compound is manufctured by reacting one or more
chemical starting compounds of one or more elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb,

IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the periodic system as
well as of the lanthanides and actinides with a flake graphite having a grain size

≤ 50 µm,
the graphite intercalation compound is converted by an oxidation agent at 500°C
- 1000°C into a binary oxide of one or more elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb,

IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the periodic system as
well as of the lanthanides and actinides.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that for the graphite
intercalation compound use is made of a ternary graphite intercalation compound of two

elements of the groups Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII
of the periodic system as well as of the lanthanides and actinides.
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that at least one
starting compound consists of a nitrate or oxynitrate of one or more elements of the

groups Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIb, VIII of the periodic
system as well as of the lanthanides and actinides.
