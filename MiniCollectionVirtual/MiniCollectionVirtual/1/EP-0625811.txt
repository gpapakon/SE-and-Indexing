<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light
source apparatus for use in a high-density optical disk
system and the like, and particularly to a short wavelength
light source apparatus incorporating a semiconductor
laser as a pump light source.In the field of high density recording using
optical disks and image processing, there has been a
need for light source apparatuses which incorporate
semiconductor lasers as pump light sources and which
provide green light or blue light by converting light
emitted from the semiconductor lasers into light having
different wavelengths. Such a light source apparatus
is required to satisfy the following stipulations.
1) The output light has a Gaussian light intensity
distribution in the lateral direction, and light can
be focused at the diffraction limit.2) The optical power of the output light is on
the order of a few mW (milliwatts), and the operation
is stable both in terms of the generated frequency and
as a function of time.In order to obtain a short wavelength light
source apparatus having an output power of a few mW or
more with a semiconductor laser incorporated as a pump
light source, a method for directly converting the
wavelength of semiconductor laser light is regarded as 
promising. The method typically uses, as an optical
wavelength converting element, a polarization inversion
type optical waveguide element of a quasi-phase matching
(hereinafter referred to as "QPM") type using
LiTaO3, LiNbO3, and KTiOPO4 as a substrate (Yamamoto et
al.; Optics Letters Vol.16, No.15, 1156 (1991)), a
polarization inversion type bulk element, and/or a
phase matching type non-linear optical crystal having a
large non-linear optical constant, e.g. KNbO3(KN).Also regarded as promising are intracavity
type short wavelength light source apparatuses incorporating
cavities internalizing laser media. In such a
light source apparatus, a laser medium receives laser
light generated by a semiconductor laser (pump light
source) so as to effect laser oscillation, and generates
laser light having a longer wavelength than that
of the laser light from the semiconductor laser. The
generated laser light is converted into short-wavelength
light (harmonics) by an optical wavelength
converting element inserted in the interior of a resonator.First, a direct wavelength conversion method
using a polarization inversion type waveguide element
will be described. Currently, in devices incorporating
polarization inversion type waveguide element of the
QPM type, blue light having an optical output power of
1.
