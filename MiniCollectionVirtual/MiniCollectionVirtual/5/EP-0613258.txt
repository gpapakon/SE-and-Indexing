<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement (20) for 
duplex transmission in a radio or similar with transmitter 

(1) and receiver (2), the arrangement compriseing a 
transmitter filter (3), receiver filter (4) and preferably 

a transmitter/receiver device (5), wherein the receiver 
filter (4) comprises a so called SAW-filter (Surface 

Acoustic Wave Filter) and the transmitter filter (3) and 
the SAW-filter (4) are connected via a circulator (6). The 

arrangement comprises a power detecting device (7) for 
detecting the power in/to the receiver filters (SAW-filters) 

and the power detecting arrangement (7) provides 
a feed-back signal to a controlling arrangement for 

controlling the power our from a power amplifier (8) 
arranged in front of the transmitter filter (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for duplex 
transmission in a radio or similar with transmitter and 
receiver wherein the arrangement comprises a transmitter 
filter, a receiver filter and preferably a transmitter/receiver 
device which is fixedly or demountably arranged, 
wherein the receiver filter comprises a SAW-filter (Surface 
Acoustic Wave filter) and the transmitter filter and the 
SAW-filter are connected via a cirulator. The filters of a such an arrangement, on which the requirements 
are high i.e. as far as selectivity, through attenuation 
etc. is concerned, are today large among others 
because of physically large resonators. Therethrough 
arrangements of the given kind are difficult to integrate 
due their size which can be both time-consuming as well as 
it leads to increased costs. Furthermore, the products 
comprising said arrangement are large and cumbersome which 
can be of great significance for the intended application 
as well as its use and utilization as such. An example 
where it is significant that the size of such arrangements 
can be limited are hand-held telephones, particularly so 
called analogue cellular pocket telephones. Arrangements as referred to above are known. According to 
a know embodiment a duplex filter is arranged between a 
transmitter and a receiver which comprises a receiver  
 
filter and a transmitter filter wherein between the filters 
an antenna is arranged. With known embodiments either 
ceramic filters or "helical" filters are used as transmitter 
filters as well as receiver filters. Those filters 
however, have physically large resonators why the arrangement 
of the component will get large and difficult to 
integrate in customer specific circuits such as for example 
ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit). These 
arrangements are used in among others analogue cellular 
hand-held telephones which also will be large among others 
since the duplex filters are large. It is a drawback in 
portable telephones since it is essential that these are 
small and easy to handle in order to become really customer 
friendly. The requirements of the market get higher and 
higher in respect thereof. Even if also other factors play 
a roll, such as e.g. batteries, involved electronic etc., 
the filter size is a very important factor. The patent document US-A-4 811 421 discloses a transmitting and 
receiving station in which the power transmitted is controlled as a 
function of power received. Furthermore, the patent document US-A-4
