<ABSTRACT>
An enzyme immunoassay for an antigen using a solid 
phase, which employs (a) a biotinylated antibody in which a 

biotin derivative is bound to a thiol group of an Fab' 
fragment of an antibody, (b) an enzyme-labelled antibody, 

and (c) a solid phase immobilized with a substance capable 
of specifically reacting with the above biotin derivative 

selected from the group consisting of avidin, streptoavidin 
and a derivative thereof which is bound to the solid phase 

directly or via a linkage between another biotin derivative 
and a high molecular weight substance bound to the solid 

phase.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
measuring an amount of an antigen in a sample and a solid 
phase used therefor. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an enzyme immunoassay for measuring an 
amount of an antigen in a sample which comprises reacting an 
antigen in a sample either with a biotinylated antibody, an 
enzyme-labelled antibody and an avidin-immobilized solid 
phase or with an enzyme-labelled antibody and a biotinylated 
antibody-bound avidin-immobilized solid phase to form a 
biotinylated antibody/antigen/enzyme-labelled antibody 
complex on the avidin-immobilized solid phase, and measuring 
an enzyme activity on the solid phase, and a solid phase 
used therefor. In a modern medical field, it has become more and 
more important to measure a trace substance such as a tumor 
marker or a hormone. Since measurement of such a trace 
substance requires high specificity and sensitivity, an 
immunological method utilizing an antigen-antibody reaction 
which is endowed with high specificity and sensitivity has 
widely been used. There have been known various 
immunological methods including a fluorescent antibody 
method, a radioimmunoassay, an enzyme immunoassay and the  
 
like. Among others, the enzyme immunoassay where an enzyme 
is used for labelling has advantages such as a wide range of 
application, easiness in handling of reagents, capability of 
treating a large number of a sample, etc. and is becoming a 
dominant method for measuring a trace substance. In the enzyme immunoassay for measuring an amount 
of an antigen, a sandwich method has widely been used where 
in order to separate an enzyme-labelled antibody reacted 
with an antigen in a sample and an unreacted enzyme-linked 
antibody from each other (hereinafter referred to as "B/F 
separation") the reaction solution is further subjected to 
an antigen-antibody reaction with an antibody immobilized on 
a solid phase and after a B/F separation the activity of an 
enzyme bound to the solid phase is measured. However, the 
antigen-antibody reaction on a solid phase in such a B/F 
separation requires a long period of time for equilibrium, 
which results in time-consuming in measurement and makes the 
method unsuitable in the field of clinical chemistry where 
rapid and short-time measurement is required. In recent 
years, it has been contemplated to use another specific 
reaction such as avidin-biotin reaction in place of an 
antigen-antibody reaction in order to conduct the reaction 
on a solid phase more speedy.
