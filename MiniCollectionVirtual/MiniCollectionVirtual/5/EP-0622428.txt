<ABSTRACT>
A paint denaturant is provided which is for 
sedimentation of paint and is particularly for use in 

aqueous liquid circulating in a paint spray booth. The 
process for detackifying paint is provided by contacting a 

dispersion comprising a continuous aqueous phase and a 
stable discontinuous hydrophobic phase comprising a polymer 

having a density greater than 1 g/ml and an emulsifying 
agent, with an aqueous liquid. The dispersion is thereby 

destabilised and the paint particles are contact with the 
aqueous liquid which contains the destabilised dispersion. 

A paint sludge is formed which separates from the aqueous 
liquid by sedimentation. 
Preferably water-insoluble solid particles are also 
suspended in the aqueous liquid to provide control of the 

size of the flocs formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and
composition for detackifying and dispersing paint solids
for example obtained from paint over spray in enclosed
areas such as paint spray-booths.In modern paint technology automatic spraying
techniques are often used for painting large articles or
parts of articles, for example in the automotive industry
or for articles such as domestic appliances. In paint
spray-booths there is a large amount of paint overspray
which does not contact the article being painted and this
is usually collected in water by means of a water curtain
flowing through the booth or by other, similar
arrangements.Generally, the water collecting the paint overspray is
recycled and in order to ensure that the process continues
to work efficiently, the paint must be collected and
removed from the booth water. There is therefore a need to
detackify the oversprayed paint so that it can be removed
easily, to enable recirculation of water through the
system. Preferably, in addition, coagulation of the over-sprayed
paint is promoted so that the paint solids will
either float so that they can be removed from the surface
of the aqueous liquid in the spray-booth, or the paint
solids will sink so that they can be removed by
sedimentation.The detackifying process (also known as paint
denaturing or paint killing) takes place in the water
phase, by means of chemicals added to the water itself. In
addition, detackification is necessary because it prevents
paint fouling the internal surfaces of the booth and of
pipes, which will eventually cause blockages. Collection
of paint on the internal surfaces is undesirable also
because paint deposits formed on the internal walls of the
booth are subject to the growth of anaerobic bacteria which 
generate corrosive and foul-smelling substances due to
anaerobic decomposition of organic substances.Preferably a detackification composition for use in a
paint spray-booth will not promote paint (or paint
components) dissolution in water, as this may result in a
potential water pollution problem. Preferably there should
also be an anti-foaming effect to counteract undesirable
foam formation inside the booth and ideally, compositions
for addition to the booth water should also be sufficiently
"bio-resistant" to avoid immediate biological degradation
within the booth water itself.In view of the large variety of paint and lacquer
compositions which are sprayed in this type of application,
preferably the detackification composition is also
effective against a wide variety

A process for detackifying paint comprising contacting
a stable dispersion comprising a continuous aqueous phase,

a discontinuous hydrophobic phase comprising a polymer
having a density greater than 1.0g/ml and an emulsifying

agent with an aqueous liquid whereby the dispersion is
destabilised then contacting paint with the aqueous liquid

destabilisation is carried out in the presence of suspended

particles of water-insoluble solids which are preferably
inorganic, most preferably comprising clay particles.

the polymer has a density of at least 1.2g/ml, preferably

at least 1.3g/ml, more preferably at least 1.5g/ml.
A process according to any preceding claim in which
destabilisation of the dispersion is effected by reducing

the activity of the emulsifying agent.
A process according to claim 4 in which the emulsifier
