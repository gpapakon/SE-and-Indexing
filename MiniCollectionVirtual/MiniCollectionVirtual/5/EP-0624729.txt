<ABSTRACT>
An air operated double diaphragm pump for providing 
improved assembly, mounting flexibility, multiple plumbing 

combination including check valves which allow the pump to 
be mounted in any position without affecting its ability to 

prime or pump. A two shell housing design provides an 
enclosure for an air motor and includes structural ribbing, 

internal baffling, and all connections are made on the end 
of the pump in line with the diaphragm centreline allowing 

the pump to be installed in any access in line with the 
plumbing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to diaphragm pumps and 
more particularly to the design for manufacture and 
assembly of a new double diaphragm pump assembly. In the past, assembly of such diaphragm pumps required 
assembly of the numerous components about a base requiring 
appropriate assembly and orientation of both the parts and 
the base during assembly. The chances for part 
misorientation and/or assembly from difficult positions 
and/or the constant manipulation of the entire then 
assembled pump was required. Mounting options and position 
of supply and output lines required knowledge of 
preassembly or reassembly of the parts at a later point of 
application. External manifolding presented numerous 
possibilities for damage of externally supported components 
and the proper tightening of a relatively large number of 
individual fasteners. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there 
is provided a double diaphragm pump construction 
characterised by a substantially cylindrical transverse 
split shell; end cover plates disposed at each end of said 
shell; said end plates being further provided with both 
inlet and outlet pumped fluid connections so as to provide 
inline piping connection capability; and said pumped fluid 
connections are selectively interconnected by an internal 
manifold within said shell. According to a second aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a method of assembly for a double 
diaphragm pump as just defined, comprising the steps of assembling in a 
continuous stack in sequence; a first wet pumping end 
including inlet and outlet check valves, a first wet end  
 
cap, a first diaphragm, a first air cap shell, pressure 
fluid motor means, a second air cap shell, a second 
diaphragm, a second wet end cap including means for 
selectively interconnecting said first inlet and outlet 
check valves and second inlet and outlet check valves, and 
said second inlet and outlet check valves. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how 
the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be 
made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in 
which:- 
Figure 1 is a partial cross-section of an air operated 
double diaphragm pump taken at the longitudinal centre of 
a substantially circular cross-section showing a pilot 
valve in the centre position, Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but showing the 
pilot valve in the extreme right hand position, Figure 3 is a cross-section of the pump taken at a 
longitudinal cross-section

<CLAIMS>
A double diaphragm pump construction characterised by 
a substantially cylindrical transverse split shell (18); 

end cover plates (46) disposed at each end of said shell; 
said end plates being further provided with both inlet and 

outlet pumped fluid connections so as to provide inline 
piping connection capability; and said pumped fluid 

connections are selectively interconnected by an internal 
manifold (6, 44) within said shell. 
A pump construction according to claim 1, wherein at 
least one of said end cover plates is provided with a 

pressure fluid supply inlet. 
A pump construction according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
at least one of said end cover plates is provided with an 

exhaust outlet for pressure fluid. 
A pump construction according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
wherein said shell further comprises passageways forming a 

muffler communicating with a pressure fluid exhaust in at 
least one of said end cover plates. 
A pump construction according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein said internal manifold further 

comprises in part a manifold tube (123A, B) interconnecting 
pumped material inlet ports on both ends of said shell and 

pumped material outlet ports on both ends of said shell. 
A pump construction according to claim 5, wherein said manifold 
tube is in the form of a solid spacer.  

 
A pump construction according to any one of the 
preceding claims, wherein said split shell further 

comprises means for mounting said pump. 
A method of assembly for a double diaphragm pump according to claim 1, 
comprising the steps of assembling in a continuous stack in 

sequence; a first wet pumping end including inlet and 
outlet check valves (112A, 112B), a first wet end cap (4), 

a first diaphragm (106), a first air cap shell (35), 
pressure fluid motor means, a second air cap shell (18), a 

second diaphragm (107), a second wet end cap (14) including 
means for selectively interconnecting said first inlet and 

outlet check valves and second inlet and outlet check 
valves, and said second inlet and outlet check valves. 
A method according to claim 8 and further comprising 
the step of installing cover caps externally of said first 

wet end cap and said second wet end cap as a means for 
enclosing the ends of said split shell to form a pump 

package enclosed within said split shell. 
A method according to claim 8 or 9, further comprising 
the step of bolting the entire assembly package together 

with a plurality of longitudinally extending assembly bolts 
(45).
