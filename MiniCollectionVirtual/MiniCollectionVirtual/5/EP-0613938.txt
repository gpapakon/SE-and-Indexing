<ABSTRACT>
A hydrocarbon fuel composition comprising a hydrocarbon fuel and 
an amount sufficient to provide dispersancy of a hydrocarbyl-substituted 

succinic diamide, wherein the hydrocarbyl substituent, 
which is advantageously a polyisobutene, is of a size sufficient to 

render the diamide soluble in the fuel, typically from 35 to 300 
carbon atoms, and the diamide is obtained by reacting at elevated 

temperature a secondary amine, for example an N-alkyl piperazine, 
with either a hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic acid or an anhydride, 

ester or monoamide derivative thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to internal combustion
engine fuel compositions. In particular the invention relates to the
use of nitrogen-containing compounds as dispersants in the aforesaid
fuel compositions.The use of nitrogen-containing compounds for the purpose of
maintaining sludge-forming deposits dispersed in internal combustion
engine lubricating oils, thereby keeping the piston and piston rings
relatively free of deposits, is well known. Nitrogen-containing
compounds which have long been used as dispersant/detergent additives
in lubricating oils include the hydrocarbyl-substituted succinimides.
The preparation of succinimides and their use as lubricating oil
additives is described in, for example, US-A-3,024,237; US-A-3,202,678;
US-A-3,219,666 and US-A-3,275,554.Hydrocarbon fuels generally contain numerous deposit-forming
substances. When used in internal combustion engines, deposits tend
to form on and around constricted areas of the engine in contact with
the fuel. In diesel engines, deposits tend to accumulate in the fuel
injection system, thereby hampering good performance of the engine.
In automobile engines deposits can build up on engine intake valves
leading to progressive restriction of gaseous fuel mixture flow into
the combustion chamber and also to valve sticking. It is common
practice to incorporate a detergent in the fuel composition for the
purpose of inhibiting the formation, and facilitating the removal, of
engine deposits, thereby improving engine performance. Nitrogen-containing
compounds commonly used as additives in hydrocarbon fuels 
include polyisobutene amines. Their use is described in, for
example, US-A-3,565,804; US-A-3,756,793; and US-A-4,877,416.
Polyisobutene succinimides have also been disclosed as hydrocarbon
fuel additives in, for example, EP-A-0147240.Although there are references in the prior art to the use of
polyisobutene succinic amide-containing materials as additives to
fuel compositions, there would not appear to be any specific mention
in this context of the use of hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic
diamides obtainable by reacting at elevated temperature a
hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic acid or an anhydride, ester or
monoamide derivative thereof with a secondary amine. Thus, US-A-3,236,613
discloses petroleum distillate hydrocarbon fuels containing
from between about 1 to about 100 pounds, per thousand barrels of
fuel, of a compound of the following formula:
