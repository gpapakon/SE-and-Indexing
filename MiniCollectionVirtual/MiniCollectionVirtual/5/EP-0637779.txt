<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an imaging element for making 
improved aluminum offset printing plates according to the silver 
salt diffusion transfer process. Furthermore the present invention 
relates to a method for making improved aluminum offset printing 
plates with said imaging element. The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal 
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in 
US-P-2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion 
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London 
and New York, (1972). In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an 
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer 
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into 
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into 
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing 
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to 
form a silver image having reversed image density values 
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the 
exposed areas of the photographic material. A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic 
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the 
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive 
ink-repellant background. The DTR-image can be formed in the image-receiving layer of a 
sheet or web material which is a separate element with respect to 
the photographic silver halide emulsion material (a so-called 
two-sheet DTR element) or in the image-receiving layer of a 
so-called single-support-element, also called mono-sheet element, 
which contains at least one photographic silver halide emulsion 
layer integral with an image-receiving layer in waterpermeable 
relationship therewith. It is the latter mono-sheet version which 
is preferred for the preparation of offset printing plates by the 
DTR method.  
 Two types of the mono-sheet DTR offset printing plate exist. 
According to a first type disclosed in e.g. US-P-4,722,535 and GB-1,241, 
661 a support is provided in the order given with a silver 
halide emulsion layer and a layer containing physical development 
nuclei serving as the image-receiving layer. After information-wise 
exposure and development the imaged element is used as a printing 
plate without the removal of the emulsion layer. According to a second type of mono-sheet DTR offset printing 
plate a hydrophilic base, commonly anodised aluminum, is provided in 
t
