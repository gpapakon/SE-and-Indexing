<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a dynamic RAM controller and to 
a circuit for driving a plurality of dynamic RAM banks. By making 

a dynamic RAM controller provides its current mode of operation 
(access/refresh) at its output. 
It is possible to extend at will the possibilities of addressing 
of the controller itself; as a result, a sole controller is 

capable of handling several memory banks by merely adding a 
decoding logic for selection of the bank during the access 

operation mode. In this manner it is further obtained the 
advantage of having the refresh time tied only to the dimension 

of the memory bank and not to the number of memory banks since 
the refresh occurs in parallel on all memory banks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dynamic RAM controller as set 
forth in the preamble of claim 1, and to a circuit for driving a 
plurality of banks of dynamic random access memory. Dynamic random access memories are widely used semiconductor 
memories that have the advantage of allowing a high integration 
level; however, they have the disadvantage of requiring a periodic 
refresh because, should a memory location be not switched on for 
a time greater than a predetermined limit, its information 
content is irremediably lost. An example of such memories is the 
TMS44400 device manufactured by Texas Instrument and illustrated 
in Texas Instruments' DATA-BOOK "MOS Memory" 1991, pages 5-125 to 
5-144. As well known, such memories can basically operate in accordance 
with two modes of operation: a first (access) operation mode 
(write and/or read out) and a second (refresh) operation mode; 
moreover they feature the peculiarity of having an address input 
formed by a number of lines which, in general correspond to one 
half of the number of lines enough to address all their cells, 
and hence the addressing phase occurs by sending at first a 
first address called row-address, and subsequently a second 
address, called column-address, to their address input. Because of their own pecularities, control integrated circuits 
called DRAM controller, which facilitate their management and in 
particular take care of their refresh have been designed and made  
 
available on the market: an example of such integrated circuits 
is the SN74ACT4503 device manufactured by Texas Instruments and 
illustrated in Texas Instruments' DATA-SHEET, September 1988, 
revised November 1988, pages 1 to 18; such control integrated 
circuits are capable of handling a predetermined maximum amount 
of memory. When a system needs an amount of dynamic random access memory 
greater than such predetermined maximum amount, such memory is 
organized in two or more banks and two or more control integrated 
circuits are used one for each bank. The presence or several control integrated circuits implies an 
increase in the costs of the system and in the room taken up on 
the card. It is an object of the present invention to overcome the 
drawbacks of the known art. This object is reached through the dynamic RAM controller, as set 
forth in claim 1, and through the circuit for driving a plurality 
or dynamic random access memory banks, as set forth in claim 7. Further advantageous aspects of the present invention are set 
forth in the subclaims.
