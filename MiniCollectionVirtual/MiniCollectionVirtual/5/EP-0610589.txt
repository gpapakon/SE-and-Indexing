<ABSTRACT>
The capacitor has a housing (1) which is closed on all sides containing at least one wound capacitance (5) coupled to a pair of electrical terminals (6, 7) extending through the top of the housing and embedded in an insulating material (9) which is porous to the insulation gas filling a gas space (8) between the insulation material and the housing top wall. The electrical terminals pass through the gas space and are broken when a mix. permissible pressure is exceeded. Pref., the capacitor housing is rectangular with one or more vertical rows of wound capacitances extending from top to bottom embedded in a plastics resin with a Shore hardness of less than 20, with an anti-adhesion oil layer between the resin block and the inside wall of the housing.
