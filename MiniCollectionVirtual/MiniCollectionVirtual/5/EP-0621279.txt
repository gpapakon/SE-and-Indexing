<ABSTRACT>
A siloxy-aluminoxane composition which is the 
reaction product of an alkyldisiloxane and an aluminoxane 

is provided. The compositions in combination with 
metallocenes of transition metals form catalysts which can 

be used in the polymerization of olefins such as ethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This process relates generally to soluble
aluminoxane derivatives and more particularly to siloxy-aluminoxane
compositions obtained by the reaction of alkyldisiloxanes
and aluminoxanes which, in the presence of
metallocenes, form catalytically active compositions for
olefin polymerization.U.S. Patent No. 3,740,384 discloses that the
addition of dihydroxysiloxane to non-metallocene organozirconium
catalyst systems in the absence of aluminoxanes
gave improved catalyst activity in olefin polymerization.
Likewise, U.S. Patent No. 4,945,076 describes the improved
activity in olefin polymerization which is obtained by the
addition of dihydroxysiloxane to a catalyst system consisting
of a metallocene and an aluminoxane. The resulting ethylene
polymer is said to have acquired a lower melt flow rate (MFR)
than those produced without the silicon compound. U.S.
Patent No. 5,034,549 discloses that a preformed catalyst
component is obtained by the reaction of dihydroxysiloxane or
silicon diol with a zirconocene. The patent further alleges
that this catalyst component, when used in conjunction with
methyl-aluminoxane, formed a good catalyst system for olefin
polymerization.All the above mentioned disclosures describe the
use of alkoxy-silanes having Si-O-C bonds, silicon diols
having Si-OH bonds and dihydroxysiloxanes having both the
Si-O-Si and Si-OH bonds. The reagents used in the present
invention, namely alkyldisiloxanes, have only the Si-O-Si
bonds. The chemical reactivity of the alkyldisiloxanes is
significantly different from those of the silanols, silyl
ethers, silyl esters and hydroxy disiloxanes (1.
Comprehensive Organometallic Chemistry, Vol. 2, Chap. 9; 
Pergamon Press, 1982: 2. Comprehensive Organic Chemistry,
Vol. 3, Chap. 13 Pergamon Press N.Y. 1979). Those skilled in
the art would appreciate the fact that silicon compounds
having Si-OH bonds generally undergo dehydration and condensation
reactions. These reactions are rarely observed in the
case of alkyldisiloxanes. Thus, one could not anticipate any
obvious similarity between the reactions of silanols, silyl
ethers and silyl esters compared to alkyldisiloxanes. In
fact one would not expect to isolate under similar conditions,
the same product described in U.S. Patent No.
5,034,549 by substituting an alkyldisiloxane for the
dihydroxysiloxane or silicon diol, as this would require the
breaking of Si-O bond which is more difficult than breaking
the SiO-H bond.In EP-A-0 418 937 an olefin polymerization catalyst system is
disclosed which contains a group
