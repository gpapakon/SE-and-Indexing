<ABSTRACT>
A filterbag (26) for espresso coffeemakers (70) having 
loose ground espresso coffee (18) therein which is inserted 

into a funnel basket or sieve inset (74) of an espresso 

coffeemaker (70). After usage, the filterbag, with the used 
coffee grounds intact therein, is disposed of as a 

single unit without the mess or bother of loose coffee 
grounds. The filterbag includes a first piece of 

filterpaper (16) having an outer circular diameter, and being 
formed into a central, substantially cylindrical pocket 

having an outer circular diameter and a depth. A second 
substantially planar circular piece of filterpaper (20), 

having an outer diameter substantially equal to that of 
the first piece of filterpaper, is sealed to the first 

piece of filterpaper at an annular flange around the 
central substantially cylindrical pocket. A metered 

quantity of loose ground espresso coffee is sealed 
within the central substantially cylindrical pocket. In 

usage, the central substantially cylindrical pocket of 
the filterbag is placed in a funnel basket of an 

espresso coffeemaker which is then positioned in a base 
pot (72) of the espresso coffeemaker, and the annular sealed 

flange is placed and secured in place in an annular area 
between the funnel basket in the base pot and a top pot (78) 

of the espresso coffeemaker.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a 
filterbag for espresso coffeemakers, and more 
particularly pertains to a universal coffee filterbag 
for espresso coffeemakers which is designed to be 
commercially produced at a relatively high manufacturing 
production rate, and is capable of universally fitting 
and providing quality espresso coffee brewing in a 
variety of typical prior art espresso coffeemakers. Italian, espresso and cappuccino coffeemakers 
are well known in the art, and are used to brew espresso 
or cappuccino coffee. These coffeemakers generally 
include a base pot in which a measured amount of water 
is initially placed. A funnel basket or sieve inset 
having a measured amound of ground espresso coffee 
therein is inserted into the base pot. The funnel 
basket inset includes a bottom percolator stem extending 
downwardly approximately to the bottom of the base pot. 
A top pot of the espresso coffeemaker is then screwed 
onto the base pot. The top pot includes a liquid spout 
therein which extends approximately to the top of the 
top pot. In usage, the assembled espresso coffeemaker 
is heated, as on a range, until the water in the base 
pot boils. The boiling water then percolates up through 
the percolator stem, and passes through the ground 
espresso coffee in the funnel basket inset, and then 
upwardly through the liquid spout, out the top thereof, 
and into the top pot, in which the brewed espresso  
 
coffee accumulates. After brewing and serving the 
brewed espresso coffee, the top pot is unscrewed from 
the base pot. The used espresso coffee grounds are then 
removed from the funnel basket inset, and are thrown 
away or disposed of. Such espresso or Italian coffeemakers are 
currently frequently used by consumers by placing a 
manually measured quantity of ground espresso coffee 
into the funnel basket or sieve inset. After brewing, 
the used coffee grounds are disposed of, frequently 
creating a mess with the loose coffee grounds during 
disposal. Moreover, this prior art approach frequently 
creates problems with improper and imprecise 
measurements of the quantity of ground espresso coffee 
placed into the funnel basket, which results in too weak 
or too strong brewed espresso coffee. In contrast thereto, the filterbag for 
espresso coffeemakers provided by the present invention 
provides several advantages, particularly for espresso-type 
coffees which are extracted under pressure, namely, 
improved hygiene, optimal storage of the coffee, ease of 
use, better control

<CLAIMS>
A filterbag for espresso coffeemakers 
having loose ground espresso coffee therein and 

comprising a first piece of filterpaper having an outer 
circular diameter, and being formed into a central 

substantially cylindrical pocket having an outer 
circular diameter and a depth, a second substantially 

planar circular piece of filterpaper having an outer 
diameter substantially equal to that of the first piece 

of filterpaper which is sealed to said first piece of 
filterpaper at an annular sealed flange around said 

central substantially cylindrical pocket, and a metered 
quantity of loose ground espresso coffee sealed within 

said central substantially cylindrical pocket, wherein 
the central substantially cylindrical pocket is placed 

in a funnel basket of an espresso coffeemaker which is 
positioned in a base pot of the espresso coffeemaker, 

and the annular sealed flange is placed in an annular 
area between the funnel basket in the base pot and a top 

pot of the espresso coffeemaker. 
A filterbag for espresso coffeemakers as 
claimed in claim 1, wherein said first piece of 

filterpaper has an outer circular diameter in the range 
of 41.5 to 81.0 mm, said central substantially 

cylindrical pocket has an outer circular diameter in the 
range of 34.0 to 71.0 mm and a depth in the range of 

15.5 to 42.0 mm, and said second substantially planar 
circular piece of filterpaper has a diameter in the
