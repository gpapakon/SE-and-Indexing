<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a thermoplastics composition 
comprising a thermoplastic polymer having incorporated 

therein a coated particulate inorganic material. The 
coating on the particles of the inorganic material 

comprises a combination of a natural or synthetic 
polymeric material and a wax having a melting point not 

higher than the melting point of the thermoplastics 
polymer, and the polymeric material is present in the 

coating in an amount of from 1% to 10% by weight, based 
on the weight of dry inorganic material. 
The improved thermoplastic composition of the 
invention may be used in making moulded components for 

automobiles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved filler and
to a process for preparing the improved filler. The
improved filler of the invention is suitable as a
filler for a thermoplastic composition, particularly a
polyolefin composition, for example one comprising a
homopolymer or copolymer of propylene which may be used
in making moulded components for automobiles.In recent years there has been an increasing trend
to make many components of automobiles, especially
interior fittings, of plastics rather than of metallic
materials. Initially these components were made of ABS
or other polymer blends of the engineering plastics
type, but these materials are expensive. Materials
which are attractive for this purpose on account of
their relatively low price are polyolefins. However,
polyolefin compositions generally suffer from the
problem of having low stiffness and impact resistance,
and it has been found that it is necessary to add a
mineral filler to a polyolefin composition in order to
improve the mechanical properties to an acceptable
level.One mineral which has been used for this purpose
is talc, which is found to have a surface which is
compatible with polyolefins to an acceptable degree,
and which is therefore relatively easily dispersible in
a polyolefin composition. The use of talc, however, is
found to have the disadvantage that the surface of
polyolefin components containing it as a filler is
easily marked or scratched. When the surface of a
talc-filled polyolefin component is damaged in this way
the resultant disturbance of the surface layer causes
talc particles to be exposed, and shows itself in a
whitening of the surface and an increase in gloss in
the affected area.This effect is most noticeable when the polyolefin 
component has a finely textured matt surface. The
whitening effect is most noticeable when the polyolefin
component is black or dark in colour, but the localised
increase in gloss is observed with most surface
colours, even when the indentation of the surface is
only slight, as results, for example, from a light
rubbing or scuffing.GB-A-2179665 and GB-A-2220666 describe latex
coated fillers for incorporation into a thermoplastic
composition.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a process for preparing a
coated particulate inorganic material for incorporation
in a thermoplastics composition comprising a
thermoplastic polymer, which process comprises (a)
combining, in aqueous suspension, the particulate
inorganic material, a wax and a natural or synthetic
