<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a wall lining (cladding) which is also suitable for the continuous covering of room corners, comprising a material blank which is flexible to a limited extent. According to the invention, the blank (1) is formed, in its at least one corner-lining region (2), with a reduced wall thickness (S1) with respect to the wall thickness (S) of its adjacent surface regions (F), the width (B1) of the wall-thickness-reduced corner-lining region (2) being a number of times greater than the wall thickness (S) of the blank.
