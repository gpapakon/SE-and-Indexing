<ABSTRACT>
A drop-barrel weapon having a weapon frame (5) and a barrel (2) which is held on the frame (5) by a tilting joint (1), a hinge hole (6), which passes through all the hinge parts (3, 4) and is open at both ends being provided, in order to accommodate the hinge shaft, for the tilting joint (1) in mutually associated hinge parts (3, 4) on the weapon frame (5) and on the barrel (2). The hinge shaft is formed by two cylindrical hinge bolts (7) which are pushed into the hinge hole (6) from both ends. At the respective rearward end in their insertion direction, the hinge bolts (7) have a bolt head (8) of greater diameter. Furthermore, the hinge bolts (7) are secured axially in the hinge hole (6) by means of in each case one ring (12) whose diameter can be expanded resiliently and which engages in two radially opposite annular grooves (10, 11) on the hinge bolt (7) and on the wall of the hinge hole (6).
