<ABSTRACT>
A film drive control system includes a light source 
that directs a beam at a photographic filmstrip and a 

sensor located such that it detects this light source 
depending on whether or not the light source is blocked by 

the passage of the photographic filmstrip. The filmstrip 
includes perforations that indicate frame exposure areas. 

The filmstrip is advanced one frame at a time by first 
moving the film forward at a relatively high velocity 

until the leading edge of the perforation passes the 
sensor, then reducing the velocity in the forward 

direction until the trailing edge of the perforation 
passes the sensor. The filmstrip is then moved in the 

film reverse direction at a reduced velocity until the 
trailing edge again passes by the sensor, at which time 

the filmstrip is halted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
photographic equipment with motor-driven film advancement
and, more particularly, to motor control systems for film
advancement.Many photographic cameras include a film drive
feature that provides automatic advancement of a filmstrip
in the camera after an exposure is produced. Automatic
advancement places a fresh, unexposed portion of the
filmstrip at an exposure gate of the camera, leaving the
camera ready to produce the next exposure. In this way,
the camera user is freed from manually advancing the film
to produce a series of exposure frames. The film drive
feature typically is provided by a drive system having an
electric motor that is coupled to the filmstrip by a gear
train and a control system that controls the motor to move
the filmstrip in a film advance direction by a distance
approximately equal to a frame spacing interval.If a filmstrip is to be commercially processed, the
exposure frames on the film should be spaced apart at
uniform intervals that are compatible with commercial
processing equipment. This is important because most
commercial processing is automated and high-speed
processing machines are frequently used. Such machines
carry out developing and printing, for example, assuming
that film to be processed has a standard frame spacing
format. If the frame spacing does not conform to the 
conventional standard, then frames can be processed
incorrectly and ruined. For example, prints can be cut
off or superimposed on each other.Cameras with an automatic film drive feature must
quickly advance the filmstrip after each exposure by a
distance equal to the uniform spacing interval. Any
system that provides automatic film drive after an
exposure must be able to quickly move the filmstrip to
bring a fresh frame at the proper location and then
completely stop the film. For example, many cameras are
capable of producing exposure frames at a rate of four or
five frames per second.Some of the problems that are encountered by
automatic film drive systems are backlash in the gear
trains of the motor drive systems and variations in motor
load and power source conditions. Backlash refers to the
free play in a gear train, which can permit the film to
migrate from the position it occupied when the motor was
initially stopped, resulting in non-uniform spacing
between frames. Variations in load and power occur
because of variations in battery strength and intermittent
loads from systems such as flash units. Such variations
can cause inconsistent motor speed,

A method of controlling the movement of a
photographic filmstrip (12) in a camera (10) by moving

the filmstrip at relatively high and reduced velocity in
a forward film direction (22;122) and halting the

filmstrip in response to an indicia indicating an exposure frame area
(20,20';120,120') passing a predetermined location so as to be detected by an optical sensor (26) receiving a beam of light from an emitter (24) when the beam passes through the indicia and otherwise is blocked from receiving the beam; said method comprising the steps of:


moving the filmstrip at relatively high velocity in
a forward film direction (22;122) until the leading edge

(48;148) of the indicia (20;120) passes the
predetermined location (24,26) ;
moving the filmstrip (12) at a reduced velocity with respect to said relatively high velocity in
the forward film direction (22;122) until a trailing

edge (50) of the indicia (20;120) passes by the
predetermined location;
characterized by the further steps of:
moving the filmstrip at a reduced velocity with respect to said relatively high velocity in a
reverse film direction (23) until the trailing edge of

the indicia again passes the predetermined location;
and
halting the filmstrip in response to the trailing
edge (50) passing the predetermined location.
The method of controlling film movement as
defined in claim 1, wherein the reduced velocity in the

reverse film direction comprises a velocity having a
magnitude different from the magnitude of the reduced

velocity in the film forward direction.
The method of controlling film movement as
defined in claim 1, wherein said filmstrip (12) has a

plurality of indicia comprising perforations (20,20';120,120';220,220')
along at least one edge, defining exposure frame areas (46) of the film, the method comprising the further steps of:


directing the beam of light toward the filmstrip edge
containing the perforations and moving the filmstrip 

continuously in a film advance direction (22;122) from a
first exposure frame area toward a next exposure frame

area;
detecting by means of said sensor when the beam first passes through a film
perforation (20;120) indicating, the next exposure frame area and

thereafter moving the filmstrip at a reduced velocity in
the film advance direction;
detecting by means of said sensor when the beam no longer passes through the
film perforation and thereafter moving the filmstrip at a

reduced velocity in a film rewind direction (23); and
detecting by means of said sensor when the beam again passes through the film
perforation and thereupon halting the movement of the

filmstrip.
A film drive control system for advancing a
filmstrip (12) by one exposure frame (46) in a camera, the filmstrip

having a plurality of indicia (20,20';120,120';
200,200') along at least one edge that define exposure

frame areas of the filmstrip, the film drive control system
comprising:


an emitter (24) that produces a beam of light that
is directed at the filmstrip indicia, and
an optical sensor (26) that is positioned relative to the
filmstrip such that it receives the beam from the

emitter when the beam passes through one of the
indicia and otherwise is blocked by the filmstrip

from receiving the beam; said drive control system is

control the movement of the filmstrip after an exposure

is produced such that the controller first moves the
filmstrip in a film advance direction (22;122) until the

beam from the emitter passes through the leading edge of an indicia
defining a next exposure frame, the controller then

moves the filmstrip at a reduced velocity in the film
advance direction until the beam is blocked by the

indicia, then moves the filmstrip at a reduced

velocity in the reverse direction (23) until the beam
again passes through the indicia, and lastly

filmstrip in a film advance direction (22;122) and in a

film reverse direction (23);
characterized in that

said drive control system comprises

a controller (36) adapted to control the operation
of the motor after an exposure is produced to move the

filmstrip in a film advance direction at a relatively
high velocity until the beam from the emitter passes

through the leading edge of a first indicia (20,20';120,120') indicating the next exposure frame area and
