<DESCRIPTION>
 GLUCAGON-UKE PEPTIDE AND INSULINOTROPIN DERIVATIVESField of the InventionThis invention relates to derivatives of glucagon-Iike peptide 1 (GLP-1 ), truncatedGLP-1 , insulinotropin and truncated insulinotropin. More specifically, this invention relates to derivatives of GLP-1 , truncated GLP-1 , insulinotropin and truncated insulinotropin, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which have a pi of about 4.0 or less or a pi of about 7.0 or greater. The derivatives of GLP-1 , truncatedGLP-1 , insulinotropin and truncated insulinotropin within the scope of this invention are particularly suited for delivery to a mammal by iontophoresis. The derivatives of this invention have insulinotropic activity and are useful for enhancing insulin action in a mammal. The methods of treatment of this invention comprise administering to a mammal an effective amount of a derivative of GLP-1 , truncatedGLP-1 , insulinotropin or truncated insulinotropin. Further, this invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said derivatives of GLP-1 , truncated GLP-1 , insulinotropin and truncated insulinotropin. Further still, this invention relates to new uses of certain known derivatives of insulinotropin and truncated insulinotropin to enhance insulin action in a mammal by iontophoretic administration of such derivatives.Background Art The amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is known as His-Asp-Glu-Phe-Glu-Arg-His-Ala-Glu-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Gly-Gln-Ala-Ala-Lys-Glu-Phe-lle-Ala-T -Leu-Val-Lys-Gly- Arg-Gly (SEQUENCE ID NO: 1).GLP-1 is disclosed by Lopez, L C, et a|., P.N.A.S., USA 80:5485-5489 (1983); Bell, G. I., et a}., Nature 302:716-718 (1983); Heinrick, G., βt al., Endocrinol. 115:2176- 2181 (1984) and Ghiglione, M., et a}., Diabetologia 27:599-600 (1984).GLP-1 is known to be naturally processed through conversion to a 31 -amino acid peptide having amino acids 7-37 of GLP-1 (7-37). This processing reportedly occurs in the pancreas and intestine. The 7-37 peptide, herein referred to alternatively as insulinotropin, is a hormone that has insulinotropic activity. Insulinotropin has the following amino acid sequence:His-Ala-Glu-G!y-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val-Ser-Ser-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Gly-Gln-Ala- Ala-Lys-Glu-Phe-lle-Ala-Trp-Leu-Val-Lys-Gly-Arg-Gly (SEQUENCE ID NO: 2). Insulinotropin, certain derivatives thereof and the use thereof to treat Diabetes mellitus in a mammal are disclosed in PCT/US87/01005 (WO87/06941), published 

November 19, 1987. The teachings thereof are incorporated herein by
