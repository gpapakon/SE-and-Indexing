<ABSTRACT>
A sheet buffering system for use in a copier or printer producing a sequential stream 
of sheets with limited time therebetween, and with compiling and finishing of those output 

sheets on-line while subsequent sheets are being printed, a non-slip sheet feeder (16a,95) 
normally feeding copy sheets downstream to the compiler is selectably intermittently 

temporarily stopped holding the lead edge area of the first copy sheet (18) for the next set to 
be finished so that continued feeding of the trail end of the same sheet by a relatively closely 

spaced upstream feeder(22a) buckles that sheet into a buckle chamber (30) assisted by a buckle 
inducing arcuate baffle (13a,14a,14b) extending from the other side of the sheet path. The 

next printed sheet is fed normally while the buckled first sheet (18) is positively held out of its 
way. When the second sheet (20) reaches the downstream feeder (16a), it restarts to positively 

feed both sheets downstream to the compiler, together, but overlapped by a preset amount 
for registration stacking. A substantial increase is provided in the time for the preceding copy 

sheets to be operated on in the compiler. A plural sheet collection point may also be provided 
by this sheet buffering system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet buffering system and more particularly, but
not exclusively, to a sheet buffering system for use in electrostatographic or other reproducing
machines.On-line set compiling and finishing is very desirable for the pre-collated sets of
output copies printed and outputted sequentially by many modern high speed copiers and
printers, for stacking and stapling or other finishing. However, the typical process of set
collection of the printed output sheets (stacking with edge registration in a compiler tray or
bin), and, especially, then stapling and ejecting that stapled set, takes a finite time period. The
desired compiling and finishing time period for each collated set is often greater than the
normal time period or pitch provided between the copy sheets, since the copy sheets are
desirably being as rapidly sequentially printed and outputted by the copier or printer as
possible. This has often necessitated a programmed "skipped pitch", or non-print cycle, in the
print engine, for each set finished on-line, in many present reproduction systems. These non-print
skipped pitches reduce overall productivity, especially for small job sets.Maximizing time between incoming sheet job sets being compiled is critical to
desirably providing increased available compiling and finishing time. That includes the various
times required for any active edge registration feeding or jogging, active clinching, stapling,
and set ejection from the compiler, and other such typical sequential functions in a
compiler/stapler unit. If the finisher is an adhesive bookbinder or thermal edge binder tape
type, even more finishing time may be required or desired than for normal stapling. Likewise,
for a plural staple finisher, e.g., an edge stapler, or a center spline saddle stapler or stitcher, in
which the set is stapled more than once with the same stapler.One object of the present invention is to provide an improved, low cost and simple
system for avoiding inter-set printing delays with on-line job set compiling and/or finishing, by
a system for delaying selected sheet feeding to the compiler, yet maintaining positive feeding
control over the sheets.Accordingly, the present invention provides a sheet buffering system as defined in
any one of the appended claims.The buffer system disclosed in an exemplary embodiment hereinbelow enables a first
sheet about to be delivered to an output to be held (delayed) and overlapped with a second
sheet [and likewise with subsequent sheets, if desired], and then

<CLAIMS>
A sheet buffering system for feeding a sequential stream of sheets spaced-apart
along a normal sheet path, the sheet buffering system including:


a non-slip downstream sheet feeding nip (15,16) for normally feeding sheets downstream
towards a sheet output in said normal sheet path;
said downstream sheet feeding nip (15,16) arranged to be selectably intermittently
stopped with a lead edge of a first sheet (18) therein;
a sheet buckle chamber (30) upstream of said downstream sheet feeding nip (15,16)
extending away from said normal sheet path;
a non-slip upstream sheet feeding nip (22) positioned relative to said downstream nip
(15,16) along said normal sheet path with less than one sheet length therebetween and arranged to

feed said first sheet (18) in said upstream nip (22) while a lead edge of the same sheet is in said
downstream nip (15,16) whereby the trail end of said first sheet (18) is driven into said buckle

chamber (30) when said downstream sheet feeding nip (15,16) is intermittently stopped with the
lead edge therein, said upstream sheet feeding nip (22) arranged to feed a second sheet (20) along

said normal sheet path past said first sheet (18) in said buckle chamber (30) to said downstream nip
(15,16);
sheet baffles (13a,14a,14b) in said normal sheet path between said upstream and
downstream feeding nips; and
said downstream nip (15,16) arranged to be automatically restartable upon said feeding of
said second sheet thereto by said upstream nip (22) whereby said first copy sheet (18) is fed from

said buckle chamber (30) in coordination with the feeding of said second sheet (20), and both said
first and second sheets (18,20) are fed downstream by said downstream nip (15,16).
A sheet buffering system as claimed in claim 1, wherein said normal sheet path
is a sheet output path of a reproduction apparatus provided with a compiler/finisher (80) fed by said

output path and said downstream nip (15,16) for repeatedly sequentially stacking said copy sheets
in said compiler/finisher (80) for compiling with edge registration and finishing of said stream of copy

sheets into plural collated finished sets on-line as subsequent said copy sheets are being printed
and outputted by said sheet output path of said reproduction apparatus, wher
ein said downstream

second sheet fed into said compiler tray by said downstream nip for uphill compiling is

underlying said first sheet and following the trailing edge of said first sheet.
A sheet buffering system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, wherein said sheet
buffering system provides a plural sheet stopping and collection point in said buckle chamber

(30) for stopping and collecting plural said copy sheets fed from upstream thereof rather than
feeding said plural sheets further downstream in the normal sheet path.
A sheet buffering system for a sequential stream of sheets of claim 1, wherein said
sheet buckle chamber (30) extends either above or below said normal sheet path. 
A sheet buffering system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein said
