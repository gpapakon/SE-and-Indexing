<ABSTRACT>
The frictional properties of gear oils are improved by 
including at least one overbased alkali or alkaline earth 

metal carboxylate, sulphonate or sulphurized phenate having 
a TBN of at least 200 in a gear oil which comprises: oil of 

lubricating viscosity at least 80% by volume of which is 
mineral oil, synthetic ester oil or a mixture thereof; 

Mannich base ashless dispersant; metal-free, sulphur-containing 
antiwear and/or extreme pressure agent; and metal-free, 

phosphorus-containing and nitrogen-containing 
antiwear and/or extreme pressure agent. The resultant gear 

oils exhibit excellent performance when used in 
synchromesh-based transmissions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to gear oil lubricants and gear oil lubricant concentrates having a well-balanced set of performance characteristics, including enhanced frictional properties.Heretofore, additive concentrates comprising the combination of one or more Mannich base ashless dispersants, one or more metal-free sulphur-containing antiwear and/or extreme pressure agents and one or more metal-free phosphorus-containing and nitrogen-containing antiwear and/or extreme pressure agents have given excellent results when utilized in formulating API GL-4 and GL-5 gear lubricants. These gear oils exhibit excellent antiwear and extreme pressure performance in the operation of gears under high-speed, shock-load; highspeed, low-torque; and low-speed, high-torque conditions. In addition, such lubricants provide excellent results in the CRC L-60 oxidation stability test, often referred to as the "clean-gear test". A complete description of such additive concentrates and lubricant compositions is given in published European patent application Publication Number EP 531 585.WO 88/04684 and WO 91/09922 describe the use of gear oils containing overbased additives in manual transmissions.There is however one set of conditions wherein the frictional properties of such additive concentrates and lubricant compositions can be somewhat deficient. When used in synchromesh-based transmissions, the frictional properties of such lubricants can result in noisy gear changes. This deficiency is particularly manifested when subjecting the lubricant to standard synchronizer tests such as the test referred to hereinafter as the "Synchronizer Test".A need exists, therefore, for a way of improving the frictional properties of such lubricants without material adverse effect upon their otherwise excellent performance characteristics and properties. This invention is deemed to fulfill this need in a most efficient manner.The subject matter of the present invention concerns the use disclosed in the wording of independent claim 1. Claims 2 to 8 concern further embodiments of the invention.Pursuant to this invention, there is provided a gear oil which comprises at least the following components:
a) oil of lubricating viscosity comprising at least 80% by volume of mineral oil or synthetic ester oil or a blend thereof;b) at least one Mannich base ashless dispersant;c) at least one metal-free, sulphur-containing antiwear and/or extreme pressure agent;d) at least one metal-free, phosphorus-containing and nitrogen-containing antiwear and/or extreme

<CLAIMS>
Use of an overbased alkali or alkaline earth metal carboxylate, sulphonate and/or sulphurised phenate having a TBN of at least 200 in a formulated gear oil lubricant which comprises:

a) oil of lubricating viscosity, at least 80% by volume of which is mineral oil or synthetic ester or a blend thereof;
b) a Mannich base ashless dispersant;
c) a metal-free, sulphur-containing antiwear and/or extreme pressure agent;
d) a metal-free, phosphorus-containing and nitrogen-containing antiwear and/or extreme pressure agent;
