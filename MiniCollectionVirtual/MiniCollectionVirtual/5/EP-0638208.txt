<ABSTRACT>
Cable trunking (10) lined with fire resistant thermal insulating material (13, 14). The trunking (10) has a panel (12) which is removable to provide access to the interior. The panel (12) has a channel section, the flanges (12A) of which form a gas-tight seal with the rest (11) of the casing. A normally-open vent arrangement (24-26) allows heat generated by the cables (16-18, 21-22) during normal operation to be dissipated. Each vent (26) is formed in a strip (24) of highly intumescent material which fills the interior of a top-hat section housing (25). In the event of a fire outside the trunking (10), the intumescent material within the housing (25) expands to form a rigid carbon plug which closes the respective vent (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cable trunking for use in
any one of a number of applications such as in
locomotives, power stations, water or gas treatment
plant, chemical process plant, oil rigs, underground
railways, mines or aircraft, for cables such as
power cables, control cables, data transmission
cables and/or optical fibre cables.The risk of fire and its effect gives rise for concern
which should be taken into account in the design of
equipment for use in the various applications
identified above. This is especially so in the case of
locomotives for subterranean use. Cables such as power
cables, control cables, data transmission cables
and/or optical fibre cables have an operating
temperature which is quite low, typically less than
200¦248¦C, so that steps should be taken to protect
them from the effects of fire where that is a
realistic prospect. Trunking, designed to achieve
that objective is known in the art as "safety critical
trunking".FR-A-2 435 844 discloses cable trunking provided on its 
inside with a fire resistant thermal insulation layer whereby cables within
the trunking are maintained at or below their operating
temperature in the event of a fire in the surrounding
environment. The trunking has double walled sides and
bottom. It also has a removable cover. The insulation
layer is a coating applied to the inside of the inner
walls and the cover. The double walled construction
results in the trunking being heavier and more
expensive than a single walled trunking would be.According to one aspect of this invention there is
provided cable trunking as claimed in claim 1.
Preferred features are claimed by claims 2 and 3.There has to be provision for access to the interior
of trunking, at least during installation. Preferably
the trunking is provided with a removable panel line
with said fire resistant thermal insulating materia on
its surface which faces the interior of the
trunking, the panel being removable to provide access
to the interior of the trunking during it
installation and for maintenance.The trunking disclosed by FR-A-2 435 844 has vents
formed in the inner and outer walls at the sides and
bottom. The vents in the outer walls are offset with 
respect to the vents in the inner walls so that flames
cannot strike the cables within the inner walls in the
event of fire. However these offset vents allow the
ingress of hot gases in the event of a fire which is
undesirable. The present invention enables trunking to
be formed with gas-tight integrity to prevent such
undesirable ingress of

<CLAIMS>
Cable trunking (10) provided on its inside with a fire resistant
thermal insulation layer whereby cables (16-18,21,22) within the

trunking (10) are maintained at or below their operating
temperature in the event of a fire in the surrounding

environment, characterised in that the fire resistant thermal insulation layer
comprises a lining of fire resistant thermal insulating

material (13,14) which is a mat of felt-like fabric
formed of compressed ceramic fibres.
Cable trunking (10) according to claim 1, wherein
the pressed ceramic fibres are on a metal foil backing

(13A,14A).

2, wherein the insulating material (13,14) is intumescent

and/or endothermic.
Cable trunking (10) according to any one of claims
1 to 3 provided with a fire resistant mastic material

(32) at interfaces between various components of the
trunking (10).
Cable trunking (10) according to claim 4, wherein
the endothermic properties of the mastic material (32) 

are superior to that of the fibrous insulating material
(13,14).
Cable trunking (10) according any one of claims 1
to 5, provided with a removable panel (12) lined with

said fire resistant thermal insulating material (14) on

interior of the trunking (10), during its installation

and for maintenance, wherein both the removable panel
(12) and the remainder (11) of the trunking structure are

formed with a channel section, the side flanges (12A) of
the panel (12) being fitted outside the side flanges of

the remainder (11) and being sufficiently deep relative
to the side flanges of the remainder (11) to provide a

gas-tight seal therebetween, the arrangement being such
that in the event of a fire within the surrounding

environment an increase in the pressure within the
trunking (10) causes doming of the main portion of the

panel (12) with the result that the side flanges (12A)
