<DESCRIPTION>
 A polyvinyl chloride ready for processing and its preparation methodThe invention relates to a vinyl chloride, which is directly ready for processing, and in which the necessary processing additives, such as stabilizers, lubricants, colourants and reinforcing agents, etc., are added to the polymer in the polymeri¬ zation reactor. The invention also relates to a method for preparing such a vinyl chloride polymer.Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is pricewise an economical thermoplastic suitable for a large number of applications. In order to make PVC suitable for processing, one or more stabilizers, lubricants, pigments and/or modifiers are to be added to the resin obtained in the polymerization. From the point of view of the PVC- product manufacturer, it would be desirable that the polymer purchased by him/her would be as ready as possible for processing. Nowadays, this requires the building of a separate mixing plant either after the polymerization reactor or at the plant of the end-product manufacturer. Research work on the addition of additives, especially stabilizers, during the polymerization have been made and some patent publications are available.In the US patent 3862066 is described a suspension polymerization system of vinyl chloride, in which system various additives, such as stabilizers, lubricants, pigments, etc. are added to a polymerization reactor in the beginning of the polymerization or during the polymerization. At the end of the polymerization, an inhibitor stopping the polymerization is added in order to obtain the desired conversion.In the patent publication DE 3630318, polyoxazoline of a certain type is used as a suspension stabilizer, whereby organic or inorganic zinc compounds may be added to the polymerization reactor as prestabilizers. The final stabilization is performed subsequently in a conventional manner. 

 In the patent publication GB 1577030, the additives have been introduced into the polymerization reactor in connection with the bulk polymerization of vinyl chloride. According to the publication, conventional additives may be used. The polymerization may also be a two-step polymerization, whereby the additives are added in the second step. E.g. stabilizers, lubricants and processing aids are added to the polymerization.However, the methods known currently have apparently not been successful in plant scale, as far as it is known, since such processes are commercially not in use, in which a polymer suitable for processing could be obtained from the polymerization.
