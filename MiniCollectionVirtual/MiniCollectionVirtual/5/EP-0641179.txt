<ABSTRACT>
This hook is designed for use in the treatment of spinal deformities. It comprises a shank segment (2) that has a longitudinal axis (1) and, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (1), an attaching longitudinal support (5); it also comprises a hook blade (3) that connects to the shank segment (2), curves away from the longitudinal axis (1) and has a convex back side (34) and a concave front side (35). A through bore (36) extending from the convex back side (34) to the concave front side (35) is provided for locating the bolt (4).

<CLAIMS>
Hook for the treatment of spinal deformities with

A) a shaft section (2) having a longitudinal axis (1) at which a
longitudinal support (5) is attachable transverse to the

longitudinal axis (1),
B) a through bore hole (36) for the acceptance of a screw (4),
and
C) a hook blade (3) adjoining the shaft section (2) bent away
from the longitudinal axis (1) with a convex back side (34) and

a concave front side (35),

characterized in that
D) the bore hole (36) extends from the convex back side (34) to
the concave front side (35) of the hook blade (3).
Hook according to claim 1, characterized in that the
longitudinal axis (39) of the bore hole (36) includes an angle α

with an amount of 115° - 130°, preferably with an amount of
120° - 125° with the longitudinal axis (1) of the shaft section

(2). 
Hook according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
bore hole (36) has a cylindrical or conical portion (37) for the

acceptance of a screw (4) provided with a cylindrical
respectively conical head (41).
Hook according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
bore hole (36) has a spherical portion (38) for the acceptance

of a screw (4) provided with a spherical head (42).
Hook according to one of the claims 1 - 4, characterized in
that the bore hole (36) provides at least partially a thread

(39) corresponding to the thread (44) of the screw (4).
Hook according to one of the claims 1 - 5, characterized in
that the bent off free end (31) of the hook blade (4) runs

essentially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (1) of the
shaft section (2).
Hook according to one of the claims 1 - 6, characterized in
that the free end (31) of the hook blade (3) is provided with a

recess (32) which separates the free end (31) of the hook blade
(3) into two legs (33).
Hook according to one of the claims 1 - 7, characterized in
that the shaft section (2) provides a clamping device

(21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28) by which means the longitudinal
support (5) can be fastened perpendicular to the longitudinal

axis (1) of the shaft section (2).
