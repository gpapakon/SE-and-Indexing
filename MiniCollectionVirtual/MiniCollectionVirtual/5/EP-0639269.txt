The present invention relates to electrode membrane combinations for use in biosensors. The membrane is attached to the electrode by means of a linker molecule in a manner such that a hydrophilic space is provided between the membrane and the electrode. The linker molecule comprises within the same molecule a hydrophobic region which constitutes at least a proportion of the amphiphilic molecules making up the membrane or is attached to or is embedded in the membrane, an attachment region attached to the electrode and a hydrophilic region intermediate said hydrophobic and attachment regions. The hydrophilic region spans the space between the membrane and the electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrode membrane
combinations for use in biosensors. In addition, the
present invention relates to methods for the production of
such electrode membrane combinations and the use of
biosensors incorporating such electrode membrane
combinations in the detection of analytes. The present
invention also relates to novel compounds used in the
electrode membrane combinations.Biosensors comprising membranes incorporating gated
ion channels have been disclosed in International Patent
Application Nos. WO89/01159 and WO90/08783. As is
disclosed in these applications, suitably modified
receptor molecules may be caused to co-disperse with
amphiphilic molecules and produce membranes with altered
surface binding properties, which are useful in the
production of biosensor receptor surfaces of high-binding
ability and high-binding specificities. It is also
disclosed that ion channels such as polypeptide ionophores
may be co-dispersed with amphiphilic molecules, thereby
forming membranes with altered properties in relation to
the permeability of ions. There is also disclosure in
these applications of various methods of gating these ion
channels such that in response to the binding of an
analyte the conductivity of the membrane is altered.The present inventors have now determined that the
stability and ion flux properties of such membranes formed
on solid substrates can be greatly improved by
chemisorbing or covalently attaching an array of
amphiphilic compounds onto an electrode surface such that
a space is formed between the electrode and the membrane.Prior art has taught the use of such concepts as
hydrogels or porous silicon as reservoirs onto which 
bilayer membranes may be formed. These processes are
difficult to reproduce and to date no reliably and
reproducibly functioning examples have been cited in the
art. The present invention differs from the prior art in
that it consists of a single molecule that contains within
it membrane compatible hydrophobic groups, ion compatible
hydrophilic groups and groups capable of chemisorbing or
covalently attaching onto an electrode surface linked in
such a way so as to produce functioning amphiphilic
membrane/reservoir/electrode assemblies. This invention
also allows for a much simpler manufacturing process
yielding far more controllable, reproducible, and stable
bilayer and monolayer membranes that allow the
incorporation of functioning ionophores or ion channels.Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention
consists in an electrode
