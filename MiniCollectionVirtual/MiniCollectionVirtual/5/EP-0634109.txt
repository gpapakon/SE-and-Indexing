<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a solid mineral mixture for producing a mineral beverage containing 2-5% by weight of Mg, 12-18% by weight of K and 2-4% by weight of Na, in the form of water-soluble salts, calculated on the content of the elements, at least one of the water-soluble salts in dissolved form respectively forming one molecule of the bases, and the remainder up to 100% by weight of supplemented portions of conventional additives and auxiliaries, such as citric acid, vitamins, flavourings and sweeteners.

comprising salts of magnesium, of sodium and of

potassium and also additives, characterized in that the
composition comprises 3 - 4% by weight of Mg, 14 - 17%

by weight of K and 2.5 - 3.5% by weight of Na, in each
case calculated on the element content, and in that the

salts are citrate and/or bicarbonate and contents,
which are made up to 100% by weight, of customary

additives and aids, for example citric acid, vitamins,
flavourings and sweeteners.
