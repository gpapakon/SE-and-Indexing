<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods of
forming tablets or capsules from glutathione and the
tablets and capsules produced thereby.Most recently, glutathione has come under
increasing attention as a therapeutic agent.
Glutathione has been suggested for the treatment of
chemical toxicities, especially the toxicities
associated with heavy metal poisoning and cancer
chemotherapeutic regimes. See BE no. 904717 and ZA
no. 8707502J. See also L. Domingo, et al., Toxicology
vol. 62 pp. 203-211, 1990; Di Re, et al., Cancer
Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, vol. 25, pp. 355-360,
1990; L. Cozzaglio et al., Tumori, vol. 76 pp. 590-594;
M.T. Nobile et al., Tumori, vol. 75 pp. 257-258, 1989.
Glutathione, in its reduced form, is known to be
critical for optimal immune system function. Furukawa
et al., Mechanisms of Aging and Development, vol. 38
pp. 107-117, 1987; Droge et al., Immunobiology, vol. 172
pp. 151-156, 1986; Suthanthiran, et al., Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 87 pp. 3343-3347,
1990.Glutathione may be administered by a number of
conventional techniques such as interperitoneally, by
aerosol to the lungs, or intravenously. However,
aerosol administration has been shown not to raise the
effective levels of glutathione in plasma. The other
forms of administration mentioned above are painful,
inconvenient, and not necessarily effective in providing
long term, meaningful levels of glutathione in plasma.
See Aebi at al., European Journal of Clinical
Investigation, vol. 21, pp. 103-110, 1991.Not surprisingly, oral dosage forms are
preferable. One type of oral dosage form is the oral 
solution or suspension of glutathione. Oral solutions
of reduced glutathione can be effectively delivered and
absorbed in human subjects. Elevated plasma levels of
glutathione can be realized through this form of
administration. See Jones et al., FASEB Journal,
vol. 3, p. A1250, 1990; "Glutathione Centennial:
Molecular Perspectives and Clinical Implications",
Academic Press, New York 1990, pp. 423-431.While this represents a significant advantage
over other forms of administration, oral suspensions of
glutathione have disadvantages which render them much
less desirable than solid oral dosage forms.
Glutathione slurries have a foul, sulfurous taste which
is thoroughly objectionable to a patient and difficult
to mask. Furthermore, oral suspensions require fresh
preparation because glutathione is unstable in aqueous
solutions. This renders them inconvenient, and
undesirable, particularly where long term compliance
