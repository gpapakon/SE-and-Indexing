<ABSTRACT>
For controlling the material feed to a roller press, a method is described, whereby the difference between the operating values of a roller press before and after a forced change in the material feed is used to establish whether the material feed should be increased, reduced or maintained unchanged in order to optimize the operation of the roller press. By this method it is obtained that the roller press, regardless of the homogeneity of the feed material, will constantly be operating within the transition range between starve and shaft feeding and that, consequently, the roller press can be utilized to optimum extent, while simultaneousy avoiding the fluidization problems associated with shaft feeding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
controlling the material feed to a roller press for
grinding particulate material, by which method the
following stages are taken in succession:
1) a first value indicating the operating mode of
the roller press is measured during the roller
press operation2) the material feed rate to the roller press is
forcibly changed3) the new value indicating the operating mode
of the roller press is measured during the roller
press operation4) the difference between the measured values
indicating the operating mode of the roller press
is calculated, and5) the calculated differential value is compared
with a prefixed numerical value and the material
feed rate to the roller press as a function hereof
is changed.A roller press of the above kind and its function
are known from, for example, US patent No.
4.357.287.In principle, material may be fed to the roller
press in two ways, viz. by shaft feeding or by so-called
starve feeding.In the case of shaft feeding, the entire roller
gap and an area thereabove is filled with material
to be ground, enabling the rollers to draw a substantially
constant amount of material into the gap
between the rollers. Since, simultaneously, the
grinding bed thickness/gap width as well as the nip
angle are at the maximum attainable levels, and
since the feed shaft is never run empty of material,
this means that the roller press can be operated at
optimum capacity.However, shaft feeding has the disadvantage,
particularly when finish-grinding fine-grained products,
that fluidization problems may occur with
respect to the material in the feed shaft, hence
resulting in irregular and unacceptable roller press
operation. Fluidization may, for example, occur as
a result of the material in the feed shaft being
scavenged by air expelled from the compaction
zone of the roller press. The tendency towards
fluidization may be reduced to a certain extent by
decreasing the roller speed, but this will cause the
roller capacity to be correspondingly reduced.This problem is remedied by means of starve
feeding i.e. by reducing the material feed to the
roller press to such an extent that the roller gap is
not entirely filled with material, thereby avoiding a
material column over the rollers. At the same time,
this makes it possible to apply a higher roller
speed, whereby a higher roller press capacity is
obtained. In the case of starve feeding the material feed
rate is normally controlled in a manner ensuring
that, during shortage feeding of the roller press, the

A method for controlling the material feed to a
roller press for grinding particulate material, by

which method the following stages are taken in
succession:


1) a first value indicating the operating
mode of the roller press is measured during

the roller press operation
2) the material feed rate to the roller press
is forcibly changed
3) the new value indicating the operating

the roller press operation
4) the difference between the measured values

characterised in that the forced change during stage 2) is always

a reduction of the material feed rate; that the differential

second prefixed numerical value, the second prefixed numerical
value being greater than the first prefixed numerical value; that

the material feed rate to the roller press during stage 5) is
predeterminedly reduced or maintained unchanged if the

differential value is numerically less than or equal to the first
prefixed numerical value, is maintained unchanged if the

differential value is numerically greater than the first prefixed
numerical value and less than or equal to the second prefixed

numerical value, and is increased by more than the amount of the
forced change reduction if the differential value is numerically

greater than the second prefixed numerical value; that both the
first value and the new value indicating the operating mode of

the roller press result from one and only one predetermined
