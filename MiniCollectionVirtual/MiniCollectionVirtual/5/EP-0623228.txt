<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electronic control circuit 
of the "Fail-Safe Emergency Shut-Down" type comprising an 
input circuit, a first signal processing circuit, in which 
information is stored beforehand relating to the extreme 
values input signals are permitted to reach, and an output 
circuit. The expression "Fail-Safe" in the context of Emergency 
Shut-Down systems means in practice that the probability of a 
system defect as a result of which a non-defined final state 
occurs is as small as possible. The order of magnitude of 
this hazard P is equal to 10-6 or smaller. A system defect can 
occur due to all possible kinds of defects in components or 
combinations thereof. A "Safety Related System" (SRS) of this type is used to 
determine any possible dangerous exceeding of one or more 
predetermined safety limits in a process outside the area 
that is controlled and regulated by the Process Control 
System and, after detection of this exceeding, to 
automatically return this process to a wholly safe state 
without an operator having to intervene and without an 
operator having to be informed of the cause. The greatest possible reliability in combination 
with simplicity is obtained with a control circuit of the 
described type which has the feature that the said first 
signal processing circuit comprises at least one neural 
network configured from very large numbers of neurons 
operating as integrators and in real-time which operate in 
parallel and are mutually connected on a large scale, which 
networks are implemented in hardware and wherein the said 
extreme values are distributed over the neurons, wherein in 
the case one of the said extreme values is exceeded the 
output circuit generates a shut-off signal whereby a 
component controlled thereby is placed in a safe state. In a further embodiment the control circuit according 
to the invention is characterized by a second signal  
 
processing circuit comprising at least one neural network 
that is configured from very large numbers of neurons 
operating as integrators and in real-time which operate in 
parallel and are mutually connected on a large scale, which 
networks are implemented in hardware, in which second signal 
processing circuit information is stored relating to extreme 
values of the changes in the time that the output signals are 
permitted to have, wherein in the case one of the said 
extreme values is exceeded the output circuit generates an 
alarm signal which can control an alarm signalling device. This latter circuit
