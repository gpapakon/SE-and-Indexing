<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an intraocular 
irrigating and enucleated eyeball preservative 

composition containing a phosphoric acid diester 
compound of the following formula or a 

pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof 

wherein R₁ and R₂ are the same or different and each 
represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. 
The composition of this invention is highly 
lenient to the ocular tissues, particularly in the 

sense that it protects the corneal (endothelial) cells 
which are most susceptible to physiological damage in 

ophthalmic surgery, with the result that various 
ophthalmic operations can be carried out with 

sufficient safety. Furthermore, since the composition 
of this invention may be help retain the physiological 

functions of the enucleated eyeball without injuring 
its tissues, it can be used with advantage for the 

preservation of the cornea, retina, crystalline lens 
and so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a composition containing 
an ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate compound or a 
pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof for the treatment 
of intraocular irrigating and for enucleated eyeball 
preservation composition. With the recent progress and spread of ophthalmic 
surgery, inclusive of cataract surgery and operations 
for transplantation of the cornea, iris or vitreous 
body, there is a great need for satisfactory 
intraocular irrigating solutions for protecting the 
intraocular tissues in such operative procedures. If 
only inadequate provisions are available for the 
protection of intraocular tissues in ophthalmic 
operations and the tissues sustain physiological 
damage, the postoperative courses will be unfavorable 
with corneal opacity, glaucoma and retinitis ensuing at 
times. As the intraocular irrigating solution, one  
 
close to physiologic aqueous in composition is of 
course preferred but generally, so far, physiological 
saline, lactated Ringer's solution, BSS (Balanced Salt 
Solution) (trade name) and BSS PLUS (trade name) have 
been mostly employed for intraocular irrigation. 
However, these intraocular irrigating solutions are not 
effective enough to protect corneal (endothelial) cells 
which are most liable to sustain physiological damage 
in ophthalmic operations. Under the circumstances, the 
development of intraocular irrigating solutions with an 
improved functionality to protect the intraocular 
tissues, particularly corneal (endothelial) cells, has 
been awaited in earnest. Meanwhile, in an operation for the implantation of 
an ocular tissue graft such as the cornea, retina or 
crystalline lens, the ocular tissue graft material 
isolated from a donor must be preserved in such a 
manner that it may retain its physiological function 
until it has been ultimately transplanted in a 
recipient. A number of enucleated eyeball 
preservatives have heretofore been proposed for 
upholding the physiological competence of enucleated 
globes but their efficacies insure a preservation 
period only about 2 weeks at most. For example, in 
Japan a glucose phosphate Ringer's solution containing 
3.5% of dextran is in common use as a globe 
preservative today but the dextran (DX) penetrates into 
the cornea (epithelium, stroma and endothelium) in an 
early stage of preservation (within a few days) to draw  
 
in water into the tissues and reportedly induce marked 
corneal swelling. Moreover, it is reported that 
dextran weakens the joint between the corneal 
end
