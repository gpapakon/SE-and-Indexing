<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
an encapsulated toner for heat-and-pressure fixing used for
development of electrostatic latent images in
electrophotography, electrostatic printing, or electrostatic
recording, and to an encapsulated toner obtained by the
above method.As described in US-A-2,297,691 and US-A-2,357,809
and other publications, conventional
electrophotography comprises the steps of forming an
electrostatic latent image by evenly charging a
photoconductive insulating layer, subsequently exposing the
layer to eliminate the charge on the exposed portion and
visualizing the formed image by adhering colored charged
fine powder, known as a toner, to the latent image (a
developing process); transferring the obtained visible image
to an image-receiving sheet such as a transfer paper (a
transfer process); and permanently fixing the transferred
image by heating, pressure application or other appropriate
means of fixing (a fixing process). As indicated above, the toner must meet the
requirements not only of the development process, but also
of the transfer process and the fixing process.Generally, a toner undergoes mechanical frictional
forces due to shear force and impact force during the
mechanical operation in a developer device, and deteriorates
after copying from several thousands to several ten
thousands of sheets. The deterioration of the toner can be
prevented by using a tough resin having such a high
molecular weight that it can withstand the above mechanical
frictional forces. However, this kind of a resin generally
has such a high softening point that the resulting toner
cannot be sufficiently fixed by a non-contact method, such
as oven fixing, because of its poor thermal efficiency.
Further, when the toner is fixed by a contact fixing method,
such as a heat-and-pressure fixing method using a heat
roller, which is excellent in thermal efficiency and
therefore widely used, it becomes necessary to raise the
temperature of the heat roller in order to achieve
sufficient fixing of the toner, which brings about such
disadvantages as deterioration of the fixing device and
curling of the paper. Furthermore, the resin described
above is poor in grindability, thereby remarkably lowering
the production efficiency of the toner. Accordingly, the
binder resin having too high of a degree of polymerization
and also too high of a softening point cannot be used.Meanwhile, according to the heat-and-pressure fixing 
method using a heat roller, the thermal efficiency is
excellent, so that
