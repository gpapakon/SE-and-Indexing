<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement has a heat transfer device (10) via which heat is transferred from the laser diode (12) to a heat sink (14). The heat transfer capacity of the heat transfer arrangement is directly correlated with the temperature of the laser diode. The heat transfer arrangement has a hollow body containing a working fluid with one end (24) connected to the laser diode and the other end (26) connected to the heat sink.

<CLAIMS>
Device for limiting the temperature of a lightwave-emitting laser diode (
12
) and for use in space satellites, whereby the device comprises a heat transfer arrangement (
10
) by which heat is transferred from the laser diode (
12
) to a heat sink (
14
), whereby the heat transfer arrangement (
10
) possesses a variable heat transfer capacity, whereby the variable heat transfer capacity is directly correlated with the temperature of the laser diode (
12
),
characterized in that

the heat transfer arrangement (
10
) displays a heat transfer body (
31
) with a heat transit surface (
33
) and a preloading device (
32
) which can be preloaded with a varying degree of force on the heat sink (
14
) or one surface of the same, and the preloading device (
32
) displays a bellows device (
34
) containing a plunger device (
38
) and a substance (
36
) which acts on the plunger device (
38
) and the volume of which alters as a function of temperature in the range of temperatures of laser diode (
12
) and heat sink (
14
), whereby at a higher preloading force the heat transfer capacity of the heat transit surface (
33
) to the heat sink (
14
) increases, thus enabling more heat to be transferred from the laser diode (
12
) to the heat sink (
14
).
Device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that

the heat transfer arrangement (
10
) is so constructed that it is arranged together with other constructional components between the laser diode (
16, 18
) and the heat sink (
14
).
Device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
characterized in that

it displays at least one additional heat transfer arrangement (
10
).
Device according to Claim 
3
,
characterized in that

the heat transfer assemblies (
10
) are arranged in parallel.
