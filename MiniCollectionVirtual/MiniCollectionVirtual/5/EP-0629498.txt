<ABSTRACT>
Multilayer sheets of an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
resin layer and a relatively high rubber 

acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin layer are 
provided which are thermoformable. The multilayer 

sheets exhibit resistance to halogenated blowing 
agents which escape from foamed-in-place insulation. 

The multilayer sheets can be thermoformed to provide 
equipment liners such as refrigerator liners, 

dishwasher liners, car interior panels, and appliance 
housings.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermoformable,
multilayer acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)
resin sheets, equipment liners, and insulative
equipment systems. More particularly, the present
invention relates to thermoformable, multilayer ABS
sheets and thermoformed equipment liners obtained
therefrom which are used with foamed-in-place
insulation in insulative equipment systems.Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins comprise
three building blocks, acrylonitrile, butadiene, and
styrene which allow for variation in properties such
as chemical resistance, heat stability, impact
resistance, and toughness, rigidity, and processing
ease, depending on the percentages of the three major
components therein and the additives used. In
addition to providing useful properties to the
finished products, ABS resins can be easily processed
to finished parts such as by coextrusion, sheet
extrusion, thermoforming, blow molding, profile
extrusion, and injection molding. Because of its
versatility, ABS is used in a wide variety of
applications, such as equipment liners, in that it
provides strong, durable shielding in many
environments. Typical equipment liners include
automotive interior trim, business machine housings,
refrigerator liners, freezer liners, dishwasher 
liners, cooling chest liners and appliance housing
liners. ABS resin is often the material of choice
for its balance of strength, toughness (impact
resistance), appearance (gloss and color), chemical
resistance, processability, and price. For example,
this balance of properties makes ABS extruded sheets
the material of choice for thermoformed equipment
liners such as the interior food compartments and
door liners of refrigerators. Other major end uses
of ABS thermoformed extruded sheet include dishwasher
liners and interior and exterior parts for trucks,
autos, boats, and mobile homes.ABS provides deep draw capability for
thermoforming operations, strength and toughness for
durability in assembly and use, high gloss, stain and
chemical resistance to items such as food. Sheet
extrusion grades of ABS are produced as low, medium,
or high impact resins with various gloss levels
ranging from high gloss to matte (low gloss). In
many end uses, such as refrigerator liners, the ABS
is exposed to foamed-in-place insulation during
assembly. Foamed-in-place insulation typically
generates a rush of blowing agent so as to foam the
insulative material (polyurethane). This rush of
blowing agent comes in contact with and permeates
into conventional ABS liners, causing
