<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a security-protected device for transmitting documents by fax, which comprises, at the transmitter end, a security protection module placing, into the transmitted binary file representing this document, a graphics signature of "morse" type, arranged on one page of the document, and which, at the receiver end, comprises a module for decoding and verification of this graphics signature. The invention also relates to a method of security protection for transmitting documents by fax and a graphics code for image authentication.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for the secure transmission of documents by fax, characterized
in that, on the emitter side (A), it comprises a securing module

placing, in the binary file (10) transmitted representing a page of said
document, a graphic signature (16) of the "morse" type formed by several

symbol lines separated by line spaces, the elementary symbol being a square,
any bit of value "1" being represented by a square of a given colour and

any bit of value "0" being represented by a square of a different colour,
the informations of one line being contiguous, left and right marks useful

during the rereading of bits being placed at the start and end of the line,
and in that said signature is placed at the bottom of the emitted page,

or on a supplementary page grouping the graphic signatures of all the
pages of the same document.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a
microcomputer (15), which calculates and positions the graphic signature

(16) at the time of composing the message.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a
fax machine secured with an integrated securing module.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a
fax machine with a securing box in series on the transmission line.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that a security module is integrated in the securing module to obtain

an electronic signature of the message, which is integrated in the graphic
coding.
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterized in that the security
module has a smart card reader able to read a smart card individual to each

user having a confidential code enabling him to authenticate it.
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that, on the
recipient side (B), it compr
ises a module for decoding and checking the 
graphic signature.
Process for securing the transmission of documents by fax, characterized
in that, on emission, with each emitted document page is associated

a graphic signature representing it, in that said graphic signature is
formed from several symbol lines separated by line spaces, the elementary

symbol being a square, any bit with the value 1 being represented by a
square of a given colour and any bit with the value 0 by a square of a

different colour, the informations being contiguous, left and right marks,
useful during the reading back of the bits, being placed at the start

and end of the line and in that said signature is placed in the bottom of
the emitted page, or on a supplementary page grouping the graphic signatures

of all the pages of the same document.
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that, in order to ensure
a high immunity, to the noise of the graphic signature, redundancy bits

are added to the coded signal permitting the correction of isolated errors
during reading.
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that use is made of a
Hamming code on 127 bits with 7 check bits.
Process according to claim 8, characterized in that, on reception, use
is made of an "antinoise" morphological masking making it possible to

eliminate on that part of the bitmap file corresponding to the graphic
signature, the image defects which have occurred during transmission and/or

printing and/or storage (spots, lines, folds, etc.), whose size is smaller
than that of the squares.
Process according to any one of the claims 8 to 11, characterized in
that, on reception, the bitmap file of the image is received directly, or

is obtained from a rescanned sheet in the case of an a posteriori check.
Process according to claim 12, characterized in that there is a
sequential reading of the bits line by line commencing with the first bit

top left, the left and right marks added during the formation of the 
graphic signature making it possible to guide the reading of the bits.
Process according to claim 13, characterized in that, in the case of
an a posteriori check, the fax page is printed and a calculation is made

of the algebraic excess i added to each identical "0" or "1" bit block
and a fault is detected if


Process according to any one of the claims 12 to 14, characterized in
that the consistency between the bits of the message and the electronic

signature bits is checked.
Process according to claim 15, characterized in that the consistency
between the decoded graphic signature and the image received in uncoded

form is checked.
Process according to claim 16, characterized in that, on reception
and in the case of an a posteriori check, an "elastic" difference is formed

between the image from the graphic signature and the image received in
uncoded form.
Graphic code for authenticating an image, characterized in that it
comprises a group of symbol lines, corresponding to a coding of said image,

separated by line spaces, the elementary symbol being a square, any bit of
value "1" being represented by a square of a given colour, e.g. black,

and any bit of value "0" being represented by a square of a different
colour, e.g. white, the informations of the same line being contiguous,

left and right marks useful during the rereading of bits being placed at
the start and end of the line, and in that said code is placed at the

bottom of a page of a document, or on a supplementary page grouping the
codes of all the pages of the same document. 
Code according to claim 18, characterized in that the first square is
a black square and the second is a white square.
Code according to claim 18, characterized in that these left and right
marks are formed from two black squares separated from the squares

representing the useful bits by a white square.
