<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for placing distribution boards (5, 48) carrying optical-fibre connector systems such as couplings or plugs, preferably inside a distribution cabinet (1) using 19 inch grid technology. In each case two horizontally running U-shaped rails (3, 4) are vertically arranged one above the other with the openings of their longitudinal slots (3''', 4''') facing one another, and held horizontally at their ends inside the distribution cabinet (1), between which rails the distribution board (5) is accommodated with its longitudinal edges, the legs (3', 3'') of the upper U-shaped rail (3) being longer than the legs (4', 4'') of the lower U-shaped rail (4) and the width (a) of the distribution board (5, 48) being greater than the clearance width (b) of the two outermost edges (30, 40), facing one another, of the legs (3', 3'', 4, 4'') of the upper and lower U-shaped rails (3, 4) but smaller than the clearance width (c) of the rail bases (30', 40') from one another. The U-shaped rails (43, 43') are preferably part of a frame board (41) which has a rectangular cut-out (47) for accommodating the distribution board (48). Distribution boxes (12, 12', 53) can be arranged on the distribution boards (5, 48).

Distribution cabinet, especially for optical fiber cables, particularly in 19-inch raster
scan mode, encompassing a frame-like rack (1) as well as at least one distribution

plate (5, 48) which is detachably affixed to said rack and arranged in the area of the
front surface and which holds optical fiber plug-in systems such as couplings and/or

plugs and/or optical fiber cables (13, 14, 17, 18), characterized in that

at least two horizontal U-shaped rails (3, 4), positioned vertically above each other
and arranged parallel to the front surface of the distribution cabinet, with the opposing

openings of their lengthwise slits (3"', 4"'), are held horizontally at their ends
inside the distribution cabinet (1), between whose ends the distribution plate (5) is

held by its lengthwise edges, whereby the legs (3', 3") of the upper U-shaped rail (3)
are longer than the legs (4', 4") of the lower U-shaped rail (4) and the width (a) of

the distribution plate (5, 48) is greater than the clear distance (b) between the two
opposing outer edges (30, 40) of the legs (3, 3', 4, 4') of the upper and lower

U-shaped rails (3, 4) but less than the clear distance (c) of the rail bottoms (30', 40')
from each other so that, for purposes of being held in the vertical position, the distribution

plate can be inserted into the upper U-shaped rail and can be lowered into
the lower U-shaped rail.
Distribution cabinet according to Claim 1, characterized in that

the U-shaped rails (43, 43') are part, preferably an integral part, of a frame plate
(41), that has a rectangular recess (47) which receives the distribution plate (48). 
Distribution cabinet according to Claim 2, characterized in that

in order to form the U-shaped rails (43, 43'), the frame plate (41) has an upper and
lower connection web (42, 42'), each of which has a web (54, 54') bent towards the

back at a right angle, on each of which an angled rail (44, 44') is arranged on the inside
at a certain distance to the connection web (42, 42'), thus forming U-shaped

lengthwise openings (45, 45').
Distribution cabinet according to Claim 3, characterized in that

the opposing lengthwise edges (55, 55') of the angled rails (44, 44') extend beyond
the opposing lengthwise edges (56, 56') of the upper and lower connection webs

(42, 42').
Distribution cabinet according to Claim 2, characterized in that,

at the top as well as at the bottom, the distribution plate (48) has legs (57, 58), each
running lengthwise and bent at a right angle, on each of which a rail (49, 49') having

two lengthwise legs (59, 59', 60, 60') running at a right angle to each other is

mounted, whose vertical lengthwise legs (59, 60) protrude into the U-shaped
lengthwise openings (45, 45') and the inner lengthwise edges (56, 56', 55, 55') extend

beyond the frame plate (41), whereby a distribution box (53) is mounted between
the legs (57, 58).
Distribution cabinet according to Claim 1, characterized in that,

a flat rail (6, 7) is mounted lengthwise on the distribution plate (5), at the top as well
as at the bottom, said flat rail extending beyond the lengthwise edges of the distribution

plate (5), whereby the width (a) of the distribution plate (5), together with the
flat rails (6, 7), is greater than the clear distance (b) between the two opposing outer

edges (30, 40) of the legs (3, 3', 4, 4') of the upper and lower U-shaped rails (3, 4)
but less than the clear distance (c) of the rail bottoms (30', 40') from each other. 
Distribution cabinet according to Claim 6, characterized in that,

at least on the upper flat rail (7) between the upper edge of the distribution plate (5)
and the lower edge (30) of the outer leg (3') of the upper U-shaped rail (3) on the

door side, there is a removable ledger (8, 52) to secure and release the distribution
plate (5, 48) or the distribution box (12, 12') inside the distribution cabinet (1).
Distribution cabinet according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that,

inside the distribution cabinet (1), in the side door area, there are vertical perforated
rails (2, 2') on which the U-shaped rails (3, 4) are held by their ends.
Distribution cabinet according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the distribution plate (5, 48) is the front of a distribution box (12, 12', 53) which is
cuboid in shape and, in the top view from above, at its back end facing away from

in the back, narrow face wall (63), across from the distribution plate (48), the distribution
box (53) has a lengthwise slit (62) open towards the top for inserting and

strain-relieving a cable holder of the trunk or feed cable (13, 14).
Distribution cabinet according to Claims 1, 2, 9 or 10, characterized in that,

in two U-shaped rails (3, 4) associated with each other, there are two distribution
