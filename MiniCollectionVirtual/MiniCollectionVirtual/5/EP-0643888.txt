<ABSTRACT>
An optical communication system includes a head-end station (1), an optical fibre network (2) and a number of sensors and actuators (S, A) connected via the network to the head-end station. The head-end station (1) includes one or more broadband sources (3, 9) and is arranged to output a broadband signal onto the network (2). The sensors modulate the broadband signal received from the head-end station (1) and return narrowband components of the signal via the network to the head-end (1). There the different narrowband components are detected, for example using a demultiplexer (7) and the resulting signals processed by control electronics (8). The head-end station also includes an optical circuit arranged to split a signal from a broadband source (9) into different narrowband components. Electro-optic modulators (FOM) modulate the different narrowband components and the resulting narrowband signals are output onto the fibre network (2) and transmitted to the actuators. The electro-optic modulators (FOM) are operated by the control electronics (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
communication system particularly suitable for use in
gathering data from a number of sensors. Sensors of the
type the present invention is concerned with are used, for
example, in industry for process control, pollution
monitoring and chemical/biological analyses. The system
might also be used with domestic sensors, such as smoke
detectors or burglar alarms.The use of optical rather than non-optical wired
networks for such sensors potentially offers a number of
advantages, including immunity from sparking in a flammable
environment, and immunity to electro-magnetic interference
(EMI). However because of their characteristics of more or
less continual data output at low data rates, sensors are
not generally suitable for connecting directly to
conventional optical telecommunications networks. It would
be desirable to provide a network particularly suitable for
sensor data but which also carries diverse other types of
traffic.It has previously been proposed to provide a system
using an optical fibre network having a bus-type topology
to communicate data from a plurality of sensors to a head-end
station. Each branch of the network is connected to
the bus by a wavelength selective tap, so that each sensor
communicates data on a different characteristic wavelength.
Such a system is disclosed in "Wavelength Division
Multiplexing in Optical Fibre Sensor Systems and Networks",
J.M. Senior et al, OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY, Vol. 22,
No. 1, 1st April 1990. This network is primarily designed
for one-way traffic from sensors to the head-end station.
There are however situations where it would be desirable to
provide two-way data communication on the network. In many 
systems for use in industrial processes, there will be associated with each sensor
an actuator, such as a valve, switch or other control device, which is responsive to
control signals received over the network so as to provide a control loop from the
sensor via the head-end to the actuator. These control signals may be processed
by a local computer at the actuator. In the context of the present specification,
the term "actuator" also encompasses any other device responsive to optical
signals received over the network, including the receive side of a telephone, where
the two-way system is used to integrate, e.g. voice telephony with the carrying of
sensor data.EP-A-0206901 discloses a network in which a de-multiplexer splits a
broadband optical signal into different wavelength components and outputs each
