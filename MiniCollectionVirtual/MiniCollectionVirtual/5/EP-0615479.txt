<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a
ram that is utilized in high speed apparatus for forming
elongated one piece metal can bodies from relatively shallow
cups, and a method of manufacturing such a ram.The main section or body of a so-called two
piece metal container or can of the type very often used for
beer/beverages includes an elongated cylindrical sidewall,
an integral bottom and an open top. Such bodies are often
formed in drawing and ironing machines of the type described
in U.S.-A-3,704,619 issued December 5, 1972, U.S.-A-3,735,629
issued May 29, 1973, U.S.-A-4,164,860
issued August 21, 1979 and U.S.-A-4,530,228
issued July 23, 1985. The apparatus described
in the aforesaid patents produce can bodies from blanks in
the form of relatively shallow cups, by having a
reciprocated ram drive each cup through a die pack which is
a series of ringlike die elements having openings that are
graduated. Each blank passes through the largest opening
first, and each subsequent opening that the blank is driven
through is slightly smaller that the preceding opening
through which the blank has been driven. A replaceable punch mounted to the ram at the
front thereof engages each cup to drive it through the
die pack. The rear end of the ram is connected to the
drive means that reciprocates the ram along its horizontally
positioned longitudinal axis through a forward
working stroke followed by a rearward return stroke.Conventionally, rams are manufactured from a
single piece of barstock. This imposes severe limitations
on readily machining the interior of the hollow
elongated main center section of the ram. This problem
arises because the axial passages at both ends of the ram
are limited in diameter, being considerably less than the
center section diameter that will still enable the center
section to provide the required mechanical strength
(without having excessive wall thickness). Thus, in the
prior art wall thickness of the main center section was
unusually considerably greater than necessary to meet
strength requirements, so that the rams were unnecessarily
heavy.A ram according to the pre-characterising part of claim 1 and
a method according to the pre-characterising part of claim 7 are
known from US-A-4164860.To produce a relatively lightweight ram the
instant invention provides a unitary structure that is
constructed by metallurgically bonding a nose piece and a
tail piece to opposite ends of an elongated thin walled
tube that constitutes the center section. Bonding is
done by utilizing electron beam welding which

<CLAIMS>
A lightweight ram
(10) for high speed apparatus that produces relatively

elongated can bodies by driving relatively shallow cups
through a ring type die means, said ram comprising a nose

piece (12) constructed to mount and operatively position a
punch (21, 22) on said ram (10), a tail piece (13) adapted

for connection to a drive means that reciprocates the ram
(10) along its longitudinal axis, an elongated relatively

thin-walled tube (11) having a front end and a rear end ;
said tube (11), said nose piece (12) and said tail piece

(13) being in axial alignment, with said tube (11)
interposed between said nose piece (12) and said tail piece

(13) ;

   characterized in that it further comprises a
first weld (14) fixedly securing said nose piece (12) to

said tube (11) at said front end and extending forward
thereof, and a second weld (15) fixedly securing said tail

piece (13) to said tube (11) at said rear end and extending
rearward thereof, said tube (11) having an axial passage

that is of a diameter which is greater than 75 % of the
outer diameter of the tube (11).
A ram as defined by claim 1 in which the
first and second welds (14, 15) metallurgically bond the

tube (11) to the nose piece (12) and the tail piece (13),
respectively.
A ram as defined by claim 2 in which the
first and second welds (14, 15) are produced by electron

beam welding.
A ram as defined by claim 1 in which the
tube (11), the nose piece (12) and the tail piece (13) are

constructed of alloy steel.
A ram as defined by claim 1 in which the
tube (11) has a length that is greater than one hundred

times its wall thickness.
A ram as defined by claim 5 wherein
there are aligned axial passages through the tube (11), the

nose piece (12) and the tail piece (13), with the axial 
passage of the tube (11) having a diameter of at least two

times the diameter of the axial passages of both the nose
piece (12) and the tail piece (13).
A method for constructing a lightweight steel
ram (10) for high speed apparatus that produces relatively

elongated can bodies by driving relatively shallow cups
through a ring type die means, said method including the

steps of constructing a nose piece (12) adapted to mount and
operatively position a punch (21, 22) on the ram (10) and

constructing a tail piece (13) adapted for connection to a
drive means for reciprocating the ram (10) along its

longitudinal axis ;

   said method being characterized by
metallurgically bonding the nose piece (12) to the front end

of an elongated thin walled tube (11) and metallurgically
bonding the tail piece (13) to the rear end of said tube

(11) to form a ram (10) in which the tube (11), the nose
piece (13) and the tail piece (13) are axially aligned.
A method for constructing a ram as set forth
in claim 7 in which the metallurgical bonding is the result

of electron beam welding.
A method for constructing a ram as set forth
in claim 8 in which, following the metallurgical bonding

steps, the ram is subjected to stress relieving and
carburizing.
A method for constructing a ram as set forth
in claim 7 also including the steps of heat treating the

tube (11), the nose piece (12) and the tail piece (13) prior
to bonding them together ; and stress relieving the

assembled tube (11), nose piece (12) and tail piece (13)
only at localized areas adjacent the interface between the

tube (11) and the nose piece (12) and the interface between
the tube (11) and the tail piece (13).
