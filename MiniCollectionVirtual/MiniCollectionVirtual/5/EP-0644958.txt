<ABSTRACT>
Fibre or film having a matrix of a copolymer from 50 to 95 % by weight ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic monomer and 5 to 50 % by weight copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomer is characterised in that the matrix contains a dissolved chemical which alters the properties of or has an effect on the fibre or film or on an aqueous fluid absorbed by the fibre or film. The chemical can for example be an antibacterial agent or an acidic reagent capable of reacting with ammonia to reduce the ammoniacal smell of urine. The fibre or film can be used to apply a controlled quantity of a chemical to a desired location.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Fibre and FilmTechnical FieldThis invention relates to fibre and film and has particular but not exclusive reference to fibre and film of water-absorbent water-insoluble material. Water-absorbent water-insoluble materials are of use in many absorbent products, particularly products for absorbing aqueous body fluids such as baby diapers, incontinence pads, sanitary napkins and tampons, and in wiping materials for mopping up spills of aqueous fluids. Most water-absorbent water-insoluble materials are available only in powder form. There are problems in retaining an absorbent powder in the desired position in the absorbent product, for example in diapers. Fibre, whether staple fibre or continuous filaments, can be more effectively retained in position by incorporation in a fabric, and fibre or film can also be effectively retained in position in other products.Background ArtEP-A-268498 describes a water-absorbent water-insoluble polymeric fibre, film, coating, bonding layer or foam, made by forming a substantially linear polymer of water-soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomer blends comprising carboxylic and hydroxylic monomers and then reacting the carboxylic and hydroxylic monomers in the linear polymer to form internal crosslinks within the polymer.EP-A-269393 describes a water-absorbent water-insoluble crosslinked polymer fibre or film made by dry extrusion of a solution of a substantially linear polymer formed from a water- soluble blend of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising a plasticising monomer and evaporation of the solvent. The fibre or film is further plasticised, stretched 

and then crosslinked.EP-A-342919 describes film or fibre made by extrusion and stretching from a polymer of water-soluble ethylenically unsaturated monomers that include ionic monomer. A counterionic lubricant compound is absorbed into the surface of the fibre or film before or during the stretching.EP-A-397 10 describes a water-soluble linear polymer of carboxylic acid monomers such as acrylic acid and a hydroxylic monomer which can be crosslinked, after being shaped by extrusion of an aqueous solution of the polymer as fibres or film, to form crosslinks between the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups.Disclosure of InventionAccording to the present invention fibre or film has a matrix of a copolymer formed from 50 to 95% by weight ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic monomer and 5 to 50% by weight copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and it is characterised in that the matrix contains a dissolved

 CLAIMS
1. Fibre or film having a matrix of a copolymer formed from 50 to 95% by weight ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic monomer and 5 to 50% by weight copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, characterised in that the matrix contains a dissolved chemical which alters the properties of or has an effect on the fibre or film or on an aqueous fluid absorbed by the fibre or film.
2. Fibre or film according to claim 1, characterised in that the matrix copolymer is sufficiently crosslinked that the fibre or film is water-absorbent and water-insoluble.
3. Fibre or film according to claim 1, characterised in that the copolymer is partially crosslinked or lightly crosslinked but is not sufficiently crosslinked that the fibre or film is water-insoluble.
4. Fibre or film according to claim 2, characterised in that the dissolved chemical is an acidic reagent capable of reacting with ammonia to reduce the ammoniacal smell of urine.
5. Fibre or film according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the dissolved chemical is an antibacterial agent.

7. Fibre or film according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the proportion of dissolved chemical in the fibre or film is 0.02 to 20% by weight.
8. Fibre or film according to any of claims 2 to 7, 


characterised in that the matrix copolymer is crosslinked by ester crosslinks.
9. Fibre or film according to claim 8, characterised in that the copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomer consists at least partly of a hydroxyl-functional or epoxide- functional comonomer, and that the ester crosslinks are formed by reaction between carboxylic acid groups derived from the carboxylic monomer and hydroxyl or epoxide groups derived from the copolymerisable monomer.
10. A process for the production of fibre or film by extruding a solution of a matrix copolymer formed from 50 to 95% by weight ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic monomer and 5 to 50% by weight copolymerisable ethylenically unsaturated monomer into a gaseous environment wherein solvent is removed to form the fibre or film, characterised in that the solution which is extruded contains a dissolved chemical which is retained in the fibre or film and which alters the properties of or has an effect on the fibre or film or on an aqueous fluid subsequently absorbed by the fibre or film.
11. A process according to claim 10, characterised in that the solution of the matrix copolymer is an aqueous solution containing 30 to 45% by weight of the matrix copolymer.
12. A process according to claim 10 or claim 11, characterised in that the solution is extruded through a spinneret to form fibres.
13. A process according to any of claims 10 to 12, characterised in that the dissolved chemical is capable of becoming bonded to the matrix copolymer and the fibre or film is subjected to conditions such that the chemical does become bonded to the matrix copolymer. 


 14. A process according to any of claims 10 to 13, characterised in that after extrusion the matrix copolymer is crosslinked.
15. A process according to claim 14, characterised in that the crosslinking, and optionally the bonding between the dissolved chemical and the matrix copolymer, is effected by heating the fibre or film at a temperature in the range 150 to 250

19. A process according to claim 17, characterised in that the copolymer is partially crosslinked or lightly crosslinked sufficiently to increase the molecular weight of the copolymer, but not sufficiently to cause the fibre or film to become water-insoluble, by treatment of the fibre or film before the fibre or film is applied to the desired location.
20. A process according to any of claims 17 to 19, in 


which the solution is extruded through a spinneret to form fibres and the fibres are applied to the desired location in the form of a web of fibres.
