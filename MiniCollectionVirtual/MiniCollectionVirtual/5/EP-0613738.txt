<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for securing a work roll (101) in a 
rolling mill is proposed. This apparatus is of a type 

provided with a pair of roll holders (102) respectively 
abutting on the flat surfaces of each work roll (101) so as 

to be adapted to clamp the work roll (101) by means of 
clamping means (122,123). A feature resides in serrated 

members (133,134) interposed between each flat surface of a 
work roll (101) and the contact surface of each roll holder 

(102).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
securing a work roll between a pair of roll holders in a
rolling mill according to the precharacterising portion of the claim.In prior art three-roll mills, each work roll was
keyed on a driving shaft or otherwise secured thereto by
means of, e.g., a polygonal engaging member.When a work roll secured in this manner was to be
replaced with another one, special tools were required for
the work of aligning a key with a keyway or handling the
engaging member. The laborious and time-consuming character
of such work has resulted in the deterioration of operation
efficiency.It is an object of the present invention to provide
an apparatus for securing a work roll between a pair of roll
holders in a rolling mill, the construction of the apparatus
being such that the work of replacing a work roll with
another one can be easily done.Thus in accordance with the present invention,
each clamping means comprises a
bolt and a nut and in that serrated rings
are interposed between each flat surface of a work
roll and the contact surface of each roll holder,
so that the work roll may be replaced by
loosening the nut to separate the holders and drawing out the
bolt.Upon manipulation of the clamping means, a pair of
roll holders are allowed to approach each other so that the
work roll disposed therebetween may be clamped. The serrated
members make certain that the work roll is held firm to the
roll holders.In order to replace the work roll with another one,
the clamping means have only to be loosened so as to detach
the roll holders from the work roll. Then the serrated 
members are disengaged and the work roll is ready for being
removed.Fig. 1 is an entire sectional view of a principal
portion in a preferred embodiment for a roll fixing device in
3-roll rolling mill.Fig. 2 is a sectional view of a principal portion
of the roll fixing device.In Fig. 1 101 does show three rolling rolls
arranged radially at an interval of 120 in the vertical
plane, the rolls 101 being sandwiched by the respective pair
of roll holders 102 which are supported through bearings 103
by tubular support frames 104 rotatably at an eccentric
point.The feature that the roll holders 102 are supported
by the tubular support frames 104 is provided for that the
support frames 104 are rotated to shift the roll holders 102
with respect to the central portion of rolled material so as
to adjust the depression amount of rolling rolls 101.It will be appreciated that the rolling rolls 101
are adapted to be driven

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for securing a work roll (101) in a
rolling mill, wherein three work rolls (101) are arranged

radially at an interval of 120Â° in the vertical plane and a
pair of roll holders (102) respectively abut on the flat

surfaces of each work roll (101) so as to be adapted to
clamp said work roll (101) by means of clamping means (122,

123), 
characterized
 in that each clamping means comprises a
bolt (122) and a nut (123) and in that serrated rings (133,

134) are interposed between each flat surface of a work
roll (101) and the contact surface of each roll holder

(102), so that the work roll (101) may be replaced by
loosening the nut (123) to separate the holders (102) and

drawing out the bolt (122).
