<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for operating and tensioning a flexible protective element (2), such as a band (3), a curtain or a shutter, comprising a winding control shaft (5) and an unwinding control shaft (6) which are driven by means of a motor (12, 13) fitted with a brake (14, 15) which is activated so as to stop braking when one of these motors (12, 13) is switched on. With a view to ensuring that this flexible protective element is kept taut between the winding control shaft (5) and the unwinding control shaft (6), this operating and tensioning device comprises means (16) for controlling the power supplied to the motors (12, 13) so that a torque is generated by one of these motors (12, 13), which torque resists the operation of the other motor (13, 12) respectively, during the stage in which the flexible protective element (2) is being unwound or wound up, respectively.

Device for driving and putting under tension (1) of a flexible protection 
element (2), such as a web (3), a curtain or an apron (4), comprising a rolling-up-control 

shaft (5), from which and on which unrolls and rolls up said 
flexible protection element (2), and an unrolling-control shaft (6) acting on 

this latter, either directly or through transmission means (7), with a view to 
its unfoldi
ng, the rolling-up-control shaft (5) and the unrolling-control shaft 
(6) being driven in rotation each by means of a motor (12, 13) to which are associated 

braking means (14, 15) activated to stop braking when either motor 
(12, 13) is fed with power, characterized in that it includes means (16) for controlling 

the current supply to the motors (12, 13) capable of ensuring the operation, 
at reduced power and in opposite direction to the manoeuvre, of the 

motor (12) or (13), respectively, of the rolling-up-control shaft (5) or the unrolling-control 
shaft (6), respectively, according to whether one is in the unrolling 

or in the rolling-up phase, with a view to bring about a torque opposing 
this manoeuvre controlled by the operation of the motor (13, 12) of the unrolling-control 

shaft (6) or the rolling-up-control shaft (5), respectively. 
Device for driving and putting under tension (1) of a flexible protection 
element (2), such as a web (3), a curtain or an apron (4), comprising a rolling-up-control 

shaft (5), from which and on which unrolls and rolls up said 
flexible protection element (2), and an unrolling-control shaft (6) acting on 

this latter, either directly or through transmission means (7), with a view to 
its unfolding, the rolling-up-control shaft (5) and the unrolling-control shaft 

(6) being driven in rotation each by means of a motor (12, 13) to which are associated 
braking means (14, 15) activated to stop braking when either motor 

(12, 13) is fed with power, characterized in that it includes means (16) for controlling 
the current supply to the motors (12, 13) capable of ensuring the operation, 

at reduced power and in the same direction as the manoeuvre, of the 
motor (12) or (13), respectively, of the rolling-up-control shaft (5) or the unrolling-control 

shaft (6), respectively, according to whether one is in the unrolling 
or in the rolling-up phase, with a view to bring about a torque opposing 

this manoeuvre controlled by the operation of the motor (13) or (12), respectively, 
of the unrolling-control shaft (6) or the rolling-up-control shaft (5), respectively. 
Device for driving and putting under tension of a flexible protection  
 

element (2), such as a web (3), a curtain or an apron (4), comprising a rolling-up-control 
shaft (5), from which and on which unrolls and rolls up said flexible 

protection element (2), and an unrolling-control shaft (6) acting on this latter,

driven in rotation each by means of a motor (12, 13) to which, at least as 

regards the motor of the unrolling-control shaft, are associated braking means 
(14, 15) activated to stop braking when either motor (12, 13) is fed with power, 

characterized in that it includes means (16) for controlling the current supply 
to the motors (12, 13) capable of ensuring, at least during the rolling-up phase,
