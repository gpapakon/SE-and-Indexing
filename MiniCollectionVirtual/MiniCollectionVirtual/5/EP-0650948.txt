<ABSTRACT>
A fluorinating reagent represented by general formula (I), and a method of fluorinating an alcoholic hydroxyl group with 
the same, wherein R represents C₁-C₅ alkyl or dialkylamino having C₁-C₃ alkyl groups. The starting material of the reagent 

can be readily converted into the target compound, is reduced in toxicity and corrosiveness, can be readily prepared and is 
readily available. An alcoholic compound can be readily fluorinated with this reagent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorinating reagents needed for
producing compounds containing fluorine which are
important as medicines and their intermediates and to the
method of fluorination which uses the fluorinating
reagent.As reagents and methods of fluorinating an alcoholic
hydroxyl group, following methods shown in (1) to (5) have
been known so far.
(1) A method of fluorinating a hydroxyl group in
secondary alcohol or tertiary alcohol by using HF or HF/-pyridine
solution (M. Hudlicky, "Chemistry of Organic
Fluorine Compounds", 2nd ed., Ellis Horwood Ltd. 1976,
page 689 : G. A. Olah et al., Synthesis, 1973, page 786).(2) A method in which after a hydroxyl group in alcohol
is converted to an ester of sulfonic acid, the ester is 
fluorinated by making it react with alkalimetal fluoride
including KF (M. Hudlicky, "Chemistry of Organic Fluorine
Compounds", 2nd ed., Ellis Horwood Ltd. 1976, page 689).(3) A method of fluorinating a hydroxyl group by using
fluoroalkylamine as a fluorinating reagent which is
obtained from the reaction of secondary amine with
chlorotrifluoroethylene or hexafluoropropene (E. D.
Bergmann et al., Isr. J. Chem., Vol. 8, page 925, 1970:
Ishikawa et al., "Chemistry of Organic Synthesis", Vol.
37, No.7, page 607, 1979).(4) A method of fluorinating a hydroxyl group by using
diethylamino sulfur trifluoride (DAST) as a fluorinating
reagent (W. J. Middleton et al., "Org. Synthesis", Vol.
57, page 50, 1977).(5) A method of fluorinating a hydroxyl group by using as
a fluorinating reagent difluorotriphenyl-phosphorane from
the reaction of triphenylphosphine with sulfur
tetrafluoride (Kobayashi et al., "Chem. Pharm. Bull."
(Tokyo), Vol. 16, page 1009, 1968).The inventor of this invention studied new fluorinating
reagents, especially those containing phosphorus, in place
of the above-mentioned well-known fluorinating reagents. It is not easy to prepare the fluorinating reagent
described in the above (5), because very poisonous and
corrosive sulfur tetra-fluoride must be used as a raw
material.The object of this invention is to offer fluorinating
reagents containing phosphorus which can be easily and
safely synthesized.Another object of this invention is to offer a method of
efficiently fluorinating an alcoholic hydroxyl group by
using the fluorinating reagent containing phosphorus.As a result of eagerly repeating searches and studies of
the above-mentioned fluorinating reagents which contain
phosphorus and are easy to prepare, the inventor found
that
