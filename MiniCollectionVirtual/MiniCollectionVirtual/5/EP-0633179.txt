<ABSTRACT>
A description is given of a suspension device (10) which is provided for arrangement between a wheel axle (12) and a cross-strut (14), provided parallel to the latter, of a frame part of a frame for a child's or doll's pram. Attached to the cross-strut (14) is a member (16) which is provided for the purpose of securing a first attachment end (20) of a spring element (22), the second attachment end (24) of which is secured on the wheel axle (12). The spring element (22) is provided in such a manner that it is deflected from its normal rest position by the cross-strut (14) or by the member (16) and by this means is mechanically pretensioned.

A suspension device for arrangement between a wheel axle 
(12) and a cross strut (14) of a frame part, provided parallel 

thereto, of a frame of a child's or doll's pram,
 
characterized in that
 
an element (16) is secured on the cross strut (14), which is 

provided for fixing a first fastening end (20) of a spring 
element (22) whose opposite second fastening end (24) is fixed 

on the wheel axle (12), in which arrangement the spring element 
(22) is designed in such a way that it is strained with one 

bearing section (28) against the element (16), and is deflected 
by the element (16) out of its normal rest position and is 

thereby mechanically stressed. 
A device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the element (16) is designed in a reel shape with a central bush 

part (30), through which there extends the cross strut (14), and 
with two side parts laterally delimiting the bush part (30), in 

which arrangement, a pin (26) interspaced from the central bush 
part (30) extends between the two side parts, which pin is provided 

for fixing the first fastening end (20) of the spring 
element (22). 
A device according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the reel-shaped element (16) consists of two reel halves (38, 

40) which are rigidly connected to each other and to the cross 
part (14). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that
 
a casing (36) is provided which is designed with a central space 

(68) and surrounds the wheel axle (12) and the cross strut (14), 
in which arrangement the central space (68) is provided for receiving 

the spring element (22) and the element (16).  
 
A device according to claim 4,
 
characterized in 
that
 
a stop element (60) is provided in the central space (68) of the 

casing (36), and the element (16) is designed with two counter-stops 
interspaced from each other for limiting the rotational 

movement of the cross strut (14). 
A device according to claim 5,
 
characterized in that
 
the stop element (60) is formed by a pin which extends through 

the casing (36), and that the two side parts (40) of the element 
(16) are each designed with a recess (54) which are aligned with 

each other in the axial direction of the reel-shaped element 
(16) and whose flanks (56, 58) form the counterstops for the 

stop element (60). 
A device according to one of claims 4 to 6,
 
characterized in that
 
the casing (36) has two casing halves (64, 66) which surround 

the wheel axle (12) and the cross strut (14). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims,
 
characterized in that
 
the spring element (22) is a cylindrical helical tension spring. 
A device according to claim 8,
 
characterized in that
 
the helical tension spring (22) is strained against the central 

bush part (30) of the reel-shaped element (16).
