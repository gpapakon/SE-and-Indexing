<ABSTRACT>
On the basis of an autocorrelation coefficient
calculated by an autocorrelation coefficient

computation section (11) from an input speech signal,
an LSF computation section (12) computes LSF parameters

F(k) (k = 1, 2, ···, N). A modified logarithmic
transformation section (15) performs on the LSF

parameters a logarithmic transformation with offset
defined by f(k) = logC (1 + A×F(k)) to obtain modified

logarithmic LSF parameters f(k). The resulting
modified logarithmic LSF parameters are quantized by a

quantization section (14) to provide quantized LSF
parameters fq(k). Codes representing the quantized LSF

parameters fq(k) are outputted. An inverse transformation
defined by Fq(k) = (C
fq(k)
 - 1)/A is performed on
the LSF parameters fq(k) to output LSF parameters Fq(k)

on the general frequency scale.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an efficient
encoding/decoding system for speech signals and more
specifically to a method of encoding/decoding LSF (line
spectral frequency) parameters which are a type of
speech parameter and which represent spectral envelope
information of an input speech signal.The spectral envelope of an input speech signal
can be represented by LPC (linear predictive coding)
coefficients obtained by making an LPC analysis of the
input speech signal using autocorrelation coefficients
obtained from the input speech signal. For speech
encoding, the LPC coefficients are transformed into
line spectral frequency (LSF) parameters F(k) (k = 1,
2, ..., N), which are information equivalent to the LPC
coefficients. The LSF parameters are also referred to
as LSF parameters. The LSF parameters are ones on the
frequency axis. When the input speech signal is
sampled at 8 KHz by way of example, F(k) are known to
take values in the range of 0 to 4,000 Hz.In a conventional LSF encoder, the code of LSF
parameters is selected from an LSF parameter codebook
so that the error is minimized while LSF parameters
F(k) obtained by subjecting an input speech signal to
autocorrelation computation and LSF computation is used
as a target and the weighted square error criterion is
used as an indicator. The weights, which are computed 
in the weight computation section and used in the
weighted vector quantizer, are set large for LSF
parameters the distance between which on the frequency
axis is small, and small for LSF parameters the
distance between which is large. This is intended to
attach importance to frequencies in the neighborhood of
the peak of the spectral envelope. The weighted vector
quantizer generates quantized LSF parameters and
corresponding codes.The coded LSF parameters are retransformed into
LPC coefficients, thereby generating coded LPC
coefficients. The coded LPC coefficients are used as
parameters of a synthesis filter to represent the
spectral envelope characteristic of input speech.As can be seen from the foregoing, in the
conventional technique, the perceptual sensitivity in
respect to different perceptual frequencies is not
reflected in coding of the LSF parameters. Thus,
unless the coding distortion of the LSF parameters is
reduced to a sufficiently low level, distortion becomes
easy to be perceived at frequencies which is
perceptually sensitive, resulting in a degradation in
speech quality. For this reason, the conventional
technique has a problem that the coding bit rate of the
LSF
