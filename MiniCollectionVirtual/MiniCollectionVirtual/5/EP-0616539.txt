<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suction nipple eversion device for the correction of
inverted nipples.Inverted nipples are a common problem caused by short lactiferous ducts. Many
operative procedures are available for their correction but all have limitations.Remedial devices offering temporary nipple eversion to allow breast feeding are known.
For example, GB 2,240,924A to Carter shows a nipple extractor device which is
operated by pressing the flat rim of teat-shaped enclosure against the periphery of a
retracted nipple and pressing down a handle assembly to collapse the side walls of the
device and partly expel air from the enclosure. The handle is then pulled outwardly to
return the enclosure to its normal configuration thereby creating suction inside the
enclosure resulting in exposure of the nipple. The Carter device does not, however, offer
a long-term solution to the problem of inverted nipples.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a simple device for correcting
inverted nipples which obviates the need for operative intervention.Accordingly, the present invention resides in a suction nipple eversion device comprising
a nipple mould for receiving a nipple of the breast of a user of the device and a sealing
flange for sealing the nipple mould against the nipple areolar complex of the breast
under negative pressure produced upon withdrawal of air from the mould, wherein the
device further comprises a valve in fluid communication with the mould to withdraw air
from the mould and wherein the device in use is self-supporting upon the nipple areolar
complex. In use, the device according to the present invention operates by producing a suction
effect on the inverted nipple,the negative pressure acting to draw out the inverted nipple
into the mould. Since the device supports itself, individuals are free to move about
during use. The device is worn for intervals over a period of time resulting in stretching
of the lactiferous ducts and thereby providing a simple means for the correction of
inverted nipples.Preferably, the valve is provided with a syringe port and is attached to the nipple mould
by means of a flexible tube. When the device is held against the nipple areolar complex
of the breast air can be withdrawn through the valve by means of a syringe.The nipple may be visualised during use through a transparent mould.Removal is effected by simply lifting the device off the breast from the edge of the
sealing flange so disrupting the seal and equalising the pressure.The
