<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to hollow metal golf
club heads (sometimes referred to as metal woods) and more
particularly concerns a hollow reinforced metal golf club head.Hollow metal golf club heads in the shape of a golf
driver are well known in the art and have been described in the
prior art as early as 1928. Tobia United States Patent 1,658,581.
In recent years with the advent of improved materials and
investment casting methods, metal drivers have become well
accepted by golfers. Because metal drivers can be constructed
with hollow interiors, the peripheral weighting of the metal
driver head can be adjusted to provide significant advantages to
the golfer in terms of location and size of the sweet spot of the
club face.In constructing hollow metal drivers, it is generally
desirable to distribute the weight so that the club is balanced. A
club head is balanced when the center of gravity is located on a
line defined by the intersection of two perpendicular planes which
both pass through the geometric center of the striking face of the
club head. One of the planes is parallel to the sole of the club
head, and the other plane is perpendicular to the sole of the club
head. The second goal after balance is to distribute as much of
the weight as possible about the periphery of the metal driver
while maintaining the location of the center of gravity.
Consequently, it is often necessary to reinforce the striking face 
of the metal driver, and the prior art shows numerous methods for
reinforcing the striking face.Zebelean, United States Patent 4,432,549 discloses a hollow
metal driver with a wedge shaped reinforcing rib extending between
the striking face and the top of the club head which top appears to be
of uniform thickness or to have a uniform taper from front to back.
Allen, United States Patent 4,930,781 shows a metal driver with a
honeycomb matrix attached to the striking face to provide
reinforcement for the striking face. Sugioka et al, United States
Patent 4,602,787 discloses a metal driver with two reinforcing ribs
which connect the sole of the club to the striking face. Soda, United
States, 5,000,454 discloses a metal drive having a weight member of
circular configuration with a pillar behind the striking face so that the
load experienced by the striking face is transmitted by means of the
pillar to the back side of the hollow club head. Kobayashi, United
States Patent 4,489,945 discloses a hollow metal driver in which the
striking face is thicker near the sole plate than it is in the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A golf club (10) head comprising an enclosed metal body in the
shape of a head for a golf driver, the metal body having:


a. a front striking face (12) of predetermined height and
width,
b. a sole (18) of predetermined length from the striking
face (12) to the back side (24) and width,
c. a back side (24),
d. a toe (26),
e. a heel (28),
f. a top side (30) of predetermined length and width, and
g. a hosel (32) positioned adjacent the heel,

wherein the metal body has an internal cavity formed by
internal surfaces of the striking face, the sole, the back side, the toe,

the heel, and the top side and wherein at least one rib (38) extends
along and between the internal surface of the striking face (12) and

the internal surface of the top side (30) to reinforce both the striking
face and the top side and characterised in that the sole has at least

one reinforcing (48) extending along the length of the sole.
The gold club head of Claim 1, wherein the rib (38) comprises
a first element (40) of substantially uniform cross-sectional area 

extending along more than half of the height of the internal surface
of the striking face (12) and a second member (42) interconnecting

the top side (30) and the striking face (12) and extending for less than
half of the length of the top side and extending for less than half of

the length of the striking face.
The golf club head of Claims 1 or 2, wherein the top side (30)
has corrugated reinforcing protrusions (46) extending rearwardly from

adjacent the striking face (12).
The golf club head of Claims 1, 2 or 3, wherein the ridge (48)
extends along more than half of the length of the sole (18) and

terminates short of the striking face (12) and short of the back side
(24).
