<ABSTRACT>
A synchronous DRAM has cell arrays arranged in matrix, divided into 
banks accessed asynchronously, and n bit I/O buses for transferring data 

among the cell arrays. In the DRAM, the banks are divided into m blocks, the 
n-bit I/O buses located between adjacent banks, is used for time sharing 

between adjacent banks in common, the n bit I/O buses, used for time sharing 
between adjacent banks in common, are grouped into n/m-bit I/O buses, every 

n/m bits for each block of m blocks of bank, and in each block in each bank, 
data input/output are carried out between the n/m-bit I/O buses and data bus 

lines in each block. A synchronous DRAM includes a first and second internal 
clock systems for controlling a burst data transfer in which a string of burst 

data being transferred in synchronism with an external clock signal, when one 
of the internal clock systems is driven, the burst data transfer is commenced 

immediately by the selected internal clock system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a synchronous Dynamic
Random Access Memory (DRAM) for burst read/write operations.In IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, November 1991,
pages 1493 to 1497, there is described a hierarchical data bus
structure to structure a plurality of cell arrays into a
plurality of banks that are accessed asychronously.Further, US A-4,630,230 relates to a data distribution
using a pipeline technique.Still further, Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 009, No.
334 and DE 37 27 688 describe an independent row address
signal latch circuit for each cell array in a semiconductor
memory and a semiconductor memory system comprising a first
and second memory bank, respectively.Fig. 1 shows a conventional dynamic RAM (DRAM) with a
conventional basic architectural configuration. Fig. 2 shows a
detailed drawing of the conventional DRAM shown in Fig. 1.In the conventional basic architectural configuration of
the dynamic RAM (DRAM), as shown in Fig. 1, data read out of a
memory cell selected by a word line is transferred to a sense
amplifier (S/A) via a bit line. A pair of data items amplified by the S/A are read out to
an output buffer 104 through a pair of FETs 101 (shown in Fig.
2) through which the pair of data items are controlled by a
signal on a column select line CSL.In the conventional basic architectural configuration of
the DRAM shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we will describe one of
architectural configurations of a conventional synchronous
DRAM (SDRAM) below.Fig. 3 shows a path of the synchronous data read/write
operations for the input and output of one unit of data. These
operations will now be briefly explained.During the output of one string of serial data, when the
head address of the data in the string is provided, two
adjacent CSLs corresponding to column select lines CSL1 and
SCL2 are selected, and four items of data from memory cells
are read out through four pairs of DB lines. This ia a 2-bit
prefetch system whereby data read out of two columns within
two clock cycles simultaneously is transferred serially, and
two pairs of DB lines are selected to coincide with serial
access addressing from the four pairs of DB lines. This
selection is performed by a DB selector. The data on the two
pairs of selected DB lines is transferred to two pairs of RWD
lines RWD1 and RWD2. Data in the first two cycles on the two
pairs of RWD lines are stored into registers R1 and R2, and
data in the next two cycles are stored into registers 
R3 and R4.In this write operation to the registers R1 to R4, the
