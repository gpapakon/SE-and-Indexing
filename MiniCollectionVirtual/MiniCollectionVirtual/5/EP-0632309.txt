<ABSTRACT>
The optical pulse generator includes a source for generating a light beam, an electroabsorbent modulator to modulate this light beam into optical pulses, and means for controlling the voltage of this modulator. The electroabsorbent modulator includes at least two doped layers (11a, 11b, 12) and at least one interlayer (13a, 13b) interposed between these two layers, made of a non-intentionally-doped material in which an electroabsorbent material is incorporated, the absorbent or transparent state of this interlayer (13a, 13b) being controlled by a voltage (V) applied between two (11a, 11b) of the layers, which have doping of the same sign, the transmission of the modulator, as a function of the voltage (V) controlling it, being a maximum in the vicinity of the zero voltage and symmetrical with respect to it.

A light pulse generator comprising:

a source (40) for generating a light beam;
an electroabsorbent modulator (41) for modulating said light
beam into light pulses, said electroabsorbent modulator including at

least two doped layers (11a, 11b, 12; 21, 22; 31, 32) made of semiconductor
material and at least one intermediate layer (13a, 13b; 23;

33) interposed between said two layers, the intermediate layer (13a,
13b; 23; 33) being made of a material that is not intentionally doped

and that has an electroabsorbent material included therein, the
electroabsorbent or transparent state of said intermediate layer

(13a, 13b; 23; 33) being controlled by a voltage (V) applied across
two of the doped layers (11a, 11b; 21, 22; 31, 32); and
means (42) for controlling said modulator by means of a
periodic type control voltage;
the two layers (11a, 11b; 21, 22; 31. 32) of the modulator
between which the voltage (V) is applied have doping of the same

sign, light transmission of the modulator as a function of the
control voltage (V) applied thereto being at a maximum in the

vicinity of zero volts and being symmetrical thereabout, said control
voltage (V) for the modulator being a periodic voltage,

   characterized in that said means are adapted to deliver a
voltage centered on zero volts.
A generator according to claim 1, characterized in that the
modulator includes at least one layer (12, 24) having doping of sign

opposite to the doping of the layers (11a, 11b; 21, 22) between which
the control voltage (V) is applied and which co-operates therewith

and with the intermediate layer(s) (13, 23a, 23b) to form two P-I-N
diodes connected with opposite forward conduction directions.
A generator according to claim 2, characterized in that the
intermediate layer (13) is interposed between two layers (11, 12) one

of which has N-type doping and the other P-type doping, transverse
insulation (14) extending through the thickness of one (11) of said

two layers and through the intermediate layer (13). 
A generator according claim 2, characterized in that the
intermediate layer lies between two layers having same-sign doping

and is itself subdivided into two sublayers by an interposed layer
that has opposite-sign doping.
A generator according to claim 1, characterized in that the
modulator comprises a P-I-P diode or an N-I-N diode.
