<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing an extra-high-tensile and high-toughness steel
having a yield strength of 1080 MPa or more that has a
high strength despite a low carbon content and is
excellent in stress corrosion resistance in a stress
corrosive environment, such as sea water and salt water.In recent years, geophysical exploration on an
earth scale, such as search and drilling for energy
resources and occurrence of earthquake, has led to a
growing interest in ocean development in deep sea and
activated the construction and installation of various
containers for deep-sea use and the development of
research ships for deep-sea use.When various containers are used in a deep-sea
environment, since a very high pressure is applied
thereto, it is required for materials for these
containers to have a high degree of toughness and
strength from the viewpoint of structure.In order to cope with the demand for safe,
reliable, high-strength and high-toughness materials, the
development of a Ni-containing low alloy steel and an
improvement in the quality thereof have been effected in
the art. For example, proposals have been made on many
production processes, such as a process for producing a
high-strength and high-toughness steel comprising Ni-Cr-Mo-V
with C + 1/8Mo + V > 0.26 and Cr ≤ 0.8 Mo as
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 56-9358, a process for producing a Ni-Cr-Mo-V-based
extra high tensile steel as disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 57-188655, 
which enables a high strength and a high toughness to be
provided in a wide cooling rate range in a quenching
treatment, and a process for a Ni-containing steel
product, wherein very low P and very low S treatments are
effected for the purpose of ensuring a high toughness.
Although these processes are effective for increasing
strength or toughness, there is a possibility that the
reliability of the steel products produced by the above
processes is poor in the environment contemplated in the
present invention. Specifically, since the containers
used in deep sea are exposed to sea water, the steel
products should have a satisfactory resistance to
corrosion in sea water, that is, a high resistance to
stress corrosion cracking in sea water.Examples of extra high tensile steel products
having a high reliability underwater include a Ni-Cr-Mo-V-based
high-toughness and extra-high-tensile steel
proposed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication (Kokoku)
No. 64-11105, characterized by comprising
