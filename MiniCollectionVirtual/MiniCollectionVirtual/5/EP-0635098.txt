Device for catalytic purification of flowing gases, 
especially of exhaust gases from internal combustion 

engines, with a housing to be arranged in a flow path, 
said housing containing a gas-permeable support material 

in the form of a textile fabric made of heat-resistant 
fibrous material, to which a catalytically active 

material is applied, whereby the support material is a 
knitted fabric, characterised in that the knitted fabric 

(14) is folded in concertina-like fashion and folded 
together to form a stack comprising superposed layers, 

and the flow passes through in the plane of the 
individual layers of the knitted fabric. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
fibrous material contains ceramic micro-fibres. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
micro-fibres are polycrystalline mullite fibres. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the fibrous material contains 

carbon fibres. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the surface area of the fibres of 

the fibrous material amounts to at least 0.1 to 0.4 m
2
/g 
or 0.2 to 4 m
2
/g. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the knitted fabric (14) is at 

least of a double-threaded structure made from different 
fibrous materials.  

 
Device according to Claim 6, characterised in that at 
least one metal thread is worked into the knitted 

fabric. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
carbon fibres with increased surface area, e.g. 

activated carbon fibres, are worked into the knitted 
fabric. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the knitted fabric (14) contains 

fibrous material in the form of rovings. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the knitted fabric (14) contains 

fibrous material in the form of yarns in (15) made of 
staple fibres or continuous filaments. 
Device according to Claim 10, characterised in that the 
yarns are only loosely twisted with up to one twist per 

inch of length. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the knitted fabric (14) contains 

electrically conductive fibres, which are conductively 
connected to connection elements (39, 40) for an 

electric current source. 
Device according to Claim 12, characterised in that 
current flows through the electrically conductive fibres 

in the knitted fabric (14) in the direction of the 
courses, and the electrical connection elements extend 

beyond the courses in the direction of the wales.  
 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the knitted fabric (14) is held 

under a predetermined tension. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the knitted fabric (14) is 

compressed. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the knitted fabric (14) is 

circular knitted. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the fibres are additionally coated 

with another material, in particular SiO
2
. 
Use of the device according to one of the preceding 
claims in an internal combustion engine having an 

exhaust elbow, characterised in that the housing is 
formed by the exhaust elbow (30) or a portion of the 

exhaust pipe.
