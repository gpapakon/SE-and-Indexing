<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for separating 
extractable organic material from a composition comprising 

organic material intermixed with solids and water. The 
composition is contacted with a solvent and a dehydrating 

agent. The dehydrating agent removes water, improves the 
solvent extraction, and aids in later separation of the solids 

from the solvent. The process additionally provides a means 
for removing cyanide compounds from the composition and 

fixating the metals against leaching.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for separating 
extractable organic material from a composition comprising 
organic material intermixed with solids and water. The 
invention is particularly suitable for separating undesirable 
and/or recoverable organic material from solid waste and 
hazardous waste. Industry produces solid containing wastes, such as 
refinery sludge, solids-stabilized emulsions, contaminated 
soils and the like that require disposal. Some of these 
wastes are listed as hazardous wastes by the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) and are regulated under legislation 
such as the Resource, Conservation, and Recovery Act (RCRA). 
The term hazardous waste is defined by relevant government 
rules and regulations, in particular RCRA and further refers 
to organic and/or inorganic material or combinations of 
organic materials which are "listed" by the Environmental 
Protection Agency as hazardous, or which exhibit ignitability, 
corrosively or reactivity. The term solid waste refers to any 
garbage, sludge or other waste material. In the past, solid 
wastes such as refinery sludge have been disposed of by land 
fills and land farms. To comply with current regulations, the 
constituents of the solid waste is treated to separate 
some of the organic materials, to destroy cyanides and to 
fixate metals.  It is desirable to extract the organics, destroy the 
cyanide, fixate the metals and remove the water from the 
solids prior to disposal in approved land fills. Further, it 
is desirable to recycle valuable components of the solid waste 
prior to disposal. Alternatives to conventional land fills 
are being examined in view of environmental concerns and 
considerations. Various technologies for treating wastes to render the 
solids acceptable for land disposal are being developed and 
have been examined, but none has been found entirely 
satisfactory. Solvent extraction processes for treating 
wastes are mostly in the developmental stage. Limitations to 
solvent extraction technologies are consistency of treatment 
performance, toxicity of spent solvents and a non-integrated 
system for waste treatment. Other methods to process wastes 
include incineration and vitrification. Incineration is 
energy intensive, and not a publicly acceptable method of 
disposal. Vitrification is a thermal treatment process that 
converts contaminated soil into a chemically inert and stable 
product by means of high heat and is highly energy 
intensive. We have discovered a water-managed solvent extraction
