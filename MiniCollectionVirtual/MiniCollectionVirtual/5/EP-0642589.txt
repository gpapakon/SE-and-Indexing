<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONMETHOD AND REAGENT FOR INHIBITING VIRAL REPLICATIONBackground of the Invention This invention relates to reagents useful as inhibitors of viral replication, infection and gene expression. Summary of the InventionThe invention features novel enzymatic RNA molecules, or ribozymes, and methods for their use for inhibiting viral replication, e.g. , the replication of picornaviruses (poliovirus, coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus, echovirus, human rhinovirus, cardioviruses (e.g.. mengovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus) and foot-and- mouth disease virus) ; immunodeficiency virus (e.g. , HIV-l, HIV-2 and related viruses including FIV-1 and SIV-1) ; hepatitis B virus (HBV) ; papillomavirus; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ; T-cell leukemia virus, e.g.. HTLV-I, HTLV-II and related viruses, including bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and simian T-cell leukemia virus (STLV-I) ; hepatitis C virus (HCV) ; cytomegalovirus (CMV) ; influenza virus; herpes simplex virus (HSV) . Such ribozymes can be used in a method for treatment of diseases caused by these viruses in man and other animals, including other primates. Indeed one ribozyme may be designed for treatment of many of the diseases caused by these viruses.Ribozymes are RNA molecules having an enzymatic activity which is able to repeatedly cleave other separate RNA molecules in a nucleotide base sequence specific manner. Such enzymatic RNA molecules can be targeted to virtually any RNA transcript, and efficient cleavage has been achieved in vitro . Kim et al., 84 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8788, 1987; Haseloff and Gerlach, 334 Nature 585, 1988; Cech, 260 JAMA 3030, 1988; and Jefferies et al., 17 Nucleic Acids Research 1371, 1989. 

 Ribozymes act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding occurs through the target RNA binding portion of a ribozyme which is held in close proximity to an enzymatic portion of the RNA which acts to cleave the target RNA. Thus, the ribozyme first recognizes and then binds a target RNA through complementary base-pairing, and once bound to the correct site, acts enzymatically to cut the target RNA. Strategic cleavage of such a target RNA will destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein. After a ribozyme has bound and cleaved its RNA target it is released from that RNA to search for another target and can repeatedly bind and cleave new targets.The enzymatic nature of a ribozyme is advantageous over other technologies, such as antisense technology (where a nucleic acid molecule simply binds to a nucleic acid target
