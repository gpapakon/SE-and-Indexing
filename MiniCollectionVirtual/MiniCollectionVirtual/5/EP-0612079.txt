<ABSTRACT>
A method for disposal of radioactive waste in space provides for placing the radioactive waste in a cosmic module, 
launching the cosmic module with the radioactive waste into a near-earth orbit and then transferring it into a heliocentric 

orbit. The heliocentric orbit of disposal is conjugated with the orbit of one of the selected planets of the solar system, provided 
that the full revolution period on the heliocentric orbit, corresponding to the time of probable impact of the cosmic module with 

the selected planet, is no less than the time of decreasing of the radioactive radiation intensity of the waste up to a desired 
level. The plane of the disposal orbit is inclined to the ecliptic plane at an angle chosen from the condition of the passage of said 

orbit in relation to the other planets of the solar system at distances no lesser than the gravitation field sphere radii of those 
planets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the protection against radioactive radiation, and more 
specifically it deals with a method for burying radioactive wastes in space. The amounts of radioactive wastes are increasing nowadays in view of ever 
increasing use of nuclear power plants and instruments containing radioactive 
isotopes, and disposal of such wastes presents a tremendous problem. The protection against radioactive radiation from such wastes is most frequently 
ensured by burying them in the soil or in the ocean. Thus low-activity liquid and 
gaseous wastes are discharged for dissolution in water in open water reservoirs 
or into sea streams, or they are emitted into atmosphere after preliminary dilution 
with water or air. To dispose of industrial radioactive wastes of a medium 
specific activity, they are concentrated and then enclosed in special tightly sealed 
containers which are placed for a long-term storage (tens of years) in so called 
burial grounds in the form of isolated underground halls (cf. SU, A, 803874). 
This method for burying radioactive wastes does not, however, rules out their 
effect on the Earth biosphere during a long-term storage. It calls for substantial 
technical and financial effort for the construction and operation of burial grounds 
and does not make it possible to ensure a reliable burial of radioactive wastes 
(with a high activity) which release much heat to heat the surrounding rocks 
which is not safe for the environment and may result in a damage to the ecology 
of the Earth. Other methods are also known for burying radioactive wastes in space (Jr. 
Astronautics and Aeronautics, 1980, IV, vol. 18, p. 26-35), which include burial 
of radioactive wastes on a circular heliocentric orbit extending between the orbits 
of the Earth and Venus.  This prior art method comprises placing radioactive wastes in a space module and 
launching to an orbit with, subsequent formation of a heliocentric burial orbit. 
The heliocentric burial orbit is formed by imparting to the space module two 
velocity impulses of which the first impulse is imparted at leaving the terrestrial 
orbit for moving to a transitional elliptical heliocentric orbit, and the second 
impulse is imparted at this heliocentric orbit at the aphelion thereof for moving 
to the end circular heliocentric burial orbit. The above-described method cannot, however, bring a solution to the problem 
of safety for the Earth because in the event the first velocity impulse is not 
sufficient or in the event the second impulse

A method for burying radioactive wastes in space, comprising placing 
radioactive wastes into a space module and inserting the module into a near-Earth 

orbit, with subsequent transfer of the space module to a heliocentric burial orbit, 
characterized by conjugating the heliocentric burial orbit with an orbit of at least 

one chosen planet of the Solar system and setting up a period of complete 
revolution in this orbit corresponding to a time of an eventual rendevouz of the 

space module with the chosen planet which is at least equal to the time during 
which intensity of radioactive radiation of the wastes decreases to a preset level, 

with the plane of the orbit being inclined with respect to the ecliptic plane at an 
angle chosen in such a manner that this orbit is spaced at a distance from the 

orbits of other planets of the Solar system at least equal to the radius of the 
sphere of influence of the gravity field of these planets. 
A method of claim 1, characterized by the fact that, before inserting the space 
module into a heliocentric burial orbit, it is inserted into an intermediate elliptical 

heliocentric orbit conjugated with the orbit of the Earth, with subsequent transfer 
of the space module from the point of conjugation of these two orbits to a 

heliocentric burial orbit which is superposed on the orbit of the Earth, the 
distance from the space module to the Earth being set up to be at least equal to 

the radius of the sphere of influence of the gravity field of the Earth. 
A method of claim 1, characterized by the fact that before inserting the space 
module into a heliocentric burial orbit, it is inserted into an intermediate elliptical 

heliocentric orbit conjugated with the orbit of the Earth, with subsequent transfer 
of the module to a heliocentric burial orbit which is in the form of a halo-orbit 

with a center in the Earth orbit, any point of the halo-orbit being spaced from the 
Earth at a distance which is at least equal to the radius of influence of the gravity 

field of the Earth. 
A method of claim 1, characterized by the fact that, before the space module 
 

is inserted into a heliocentric burial orbit, it is inserted into an intermediate 
elliptical orbit conjugated with the Earth orbit and with the orbit of another 

chosen planet of the Solar system along which the space module is sent into the 

sphere of influence of the gravity field of the chosen planet, with subsequent 
transfer of the space module to a heliocentric burial orbit by carrying out a 

perturbative manoeuver within the gravity field of the chosen planet with a 
simultaneous alteration of the radius of the perihelion, eccentricity, and 

inclination with respect to the ecliptic plane. 
A method of claim 4, characterized by the fact that a heliocentric burial orbit 
is formed as an ellipsis with the perihelion spaced from the Sun at a distance at 

which solar radiation incident upon radioactive wastes turn them to plasma. 
A method of claim 4, characterized by the fact that a heliocentric burial orbit 
is formed with an eccentricity at least equal to unity.
