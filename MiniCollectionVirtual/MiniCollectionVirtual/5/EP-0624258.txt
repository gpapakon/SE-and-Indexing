<ABSTRACT>
A microscopy system designed to achieve upwards of 12,000 X magnification with simultaneous high resolution of better than 0.3 micron and 30 microns depth-of-field. The microscopy system (10) comprises a conventional microscope (12) having a plurality of objective lenses (32) that produce the initial magnification with acceptable limits of high resolution and depth-of-field, a projection housing (40) connected to the microscope (12) in a unique manner for increasing that magnification while still maintaining the high resolution and depth-of-field, and a light source (14) for illuminating a specimen platform (39) from its underside wherein the light source (14) is located remotely from the platform (39) and connected by a fiber optic cable (16) to a condensing lens (35) positioned beneath the specimen platform (39) and the projection housing (40) has projected image receiving device (52) therein whose distance from its projection lens (50) can be varied to vary the magnification produced by projection.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to microscopes and more specifically
to a high magnification microscopy system with improved high
resolution and depth-of-field at 6,000X magnification and
greater.In medical microscopy the objective is to get three things,
as good a resolution as possible, as much magnification as you
can resolve, and the best depth of field as possible. These
objectives in the design of optical systems generally require
compromises. In a standard optical microscope the depth of field
is inversely proportional to the magnification. As the magnification
gets higher the depth of field gets narrower. If the
object being viewed is sufficiently small that you have to
magnify it to the point your eye can see it, the depth of field
gets so narrow that there is no contour to what you are looking
at and it blurs since there is no depth of field.Another aspect in terms of microscopy is the fact that up
until a few years ago blood was believed to be sterile. It was
thought there was no fungus or bacteria in blood except under
severe pathological conditions. Today, systemic micro-organisms
in the blood have changed the early thinking that blood was
sterile. The discovery of AIDS has resulted in a complete
new understanding of the immune system of opportune organisms 
that take advantage of a depressed immune system. The standard
research microscope cannot be used to study organisms because
they are too small. In these microscopes the power of magnification
is about 1000X or 1500X. Some sophisticated systems are
availabe where you can get 2000X, and 2500X, but the depth of
field gets so narrow they are only used for research. What is
needed for examination of blood for its organisms is magnification
in excess of 5000X. Also the depth of field must be
sufficient that the total contour of the organisms can be seen.
To give a general idea of the problem, if a person wants to see a
red blood cell they need a depth of field of at least 7 microns.
If the depth of field drops to 3 1/2 microns, it is only possible
to see half the red blood cell. As the depth of field becomes
progressively less, a person can only see a slice of the blood
cell. If the interest being researched relates to membranes and
things of this sort, a different approach has to be taken to
break out of the limitations of a standard optical system.Another important criteria that hadn't been looked at is
most research microscopes concentrate on what is known as dark
field microscopy. The problem is how do you illuminate and
contrast what you want to
