<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to compositions comprising highly fluorinated, chloro-substituted, non-cyclic organic compounds having 7 to 9 carbon atoms and to processes of using them. More particularly, this invention relates to emulsions comprising those highly fluorinated, chloro-substituted organic compounds in a sufficiently high concentration to be effective in the desired level of oxygen transport, which emulsions are capable of sterilization, have long term stability, persist for sufficiently long times in the bloodstream to deliver useful quantities of oxygen, yet be eliminated rapidly enough from the body to avoid toxicity and retention in body parts and organs. This invention also relates to emulsions comprising non-cyclic perfluorochloroethers having 7 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 7 to 9 carbon atoms, especially perfluoro-bis-chlorobutyl ether. These novel emulsions have various medical and oxygen transport applications, such as ''artificial blood'' and preserving organs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compositions
comprising highly fluorinated, chloro-substituted,
non-cyclic organic compounds having 7 to 9 carbon atoms
and to processes of making and using them. More
particularly, this invention relates to emulsions
comprising those highly fluorinated, chloro-substituted
organic compounds. This invention also relates to
emulsions comprising non-cyclic perfluorochloroethers
having 7 to 9 carbon
atoms. These novel emulsions have various medical and
oxygen transport applications. They are especially
useful medically as contrast media for various
biological imaging modalities, such as nuclear magnetic
resonance, 19F-magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound,
x-ray, computed tomography and positron emission
tomography, as oxygen transport agents or "artificial
bloods," in the treatment of heart attack, stroke, and
other vascular obstructions, as adjuvants to coronary
angioplasty and in cancer radiation treatment and
chemotherapy. Highly fluorinated organic compounds, and
particularly perfluorocarbon compounds, are well known
to be both stable and chemically inert. During the
past 20 years much attention has focused on the use of
such compounds in biological systems because they are
capable of dissolving and transporting large amounts of
oxygen. These properties make them potentially useful
as contrast media, oxygen transport agents or
"artificial bloods", in the treatment of heart attack,
stroke, and other vascular obstructions, as adjuvants
to coronary angioplasty, and in cancer radiation
treatment and chemotherapy.Among the highly fluorinated organic
compounds that are said to be useful in such
applications are perfluorocarbon compounds, e.g.,
perfluorodecalin, perfluoroindane, perfluorotrimethyl
bicyclo [3.3.1] nonane, perfluoromethyl adamantane,
perfluorodimethyl adamantane, and perfluoro-2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane;
9-12C perfluoro amines, e.g.,
perfluorotripropyl amine, perfluorotributyl amine,
perfluoro-1-azatricyclic amines; bromofluorocarbon
compounds, e.g., perfluorooctyl bromide and
perfluorooctyl dibromide; F-4-methyl octahydroquinolidizine
and perfluoro ethers, including
chlorinated polyfluorocyclic ethers. Such compounds
are described, for example, in United States patents
