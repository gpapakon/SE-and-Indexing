<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system and apparatus 
and a method for finishing and polishing a dental composite 

restorative material in a tooth. The system of 

the invention uses an elastomeric polymer disc which is 
impregnated with an abrasive for reduction of the composite, 

and a felt, suede, or elastomeric polymer foam 
element for polishing the composite. A method of using 

the above apparatus in a finishing/polishing system is 
also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a finishing/polishing
system comprising an abrasive implement
for gross reduction and shaping, and a
foam type polishing element for polishing.A polishing element comprising the features specified in the preamble
of claim 1 is disclosed in GB-A-1 293 727.Dental restoratives exhibit physical and
chemical characteristics which make them suitable for
use in filling, repairing or replacing teeth. Restorative
materials should possess properties that closely
match natural teeth with respect to structural properties
such as cohesive strength, coefficient of thermal
expansion and wearability. Also, aesthetic considerations
such as color stability, refractive index, plaque
repellency, polishability and opacity are important
factors in determining whether a material is suitable
for use as a dental restorative. Numerous organic compositions
are used in various mixtures and proportions
for use as dental composites or restoratives. These
compositions usually include some type of resin, which
may either be preblended or mixed by the practitioner
in the office, together with other materials such as
pigments, catalysts, handling agents and opacifiers. 
For restorative use, it is generally necessary to
employ materials which are "filled", that is, to which
have been added amounts of inorganic, or in some cases,
organic particulate material.Dental composite and restorative materials
must have good forming characteristics so that they can
be shaped to fit a cavity area or molded into place in
order to repair chipped or damaged teeth. Furthermore,
such restorative compositions must preferably be filled
with inorganic materials in order to achieve satisfactory
hardness and durability during service.The finishing and polishing of the composite
is an important part of providing an aesthetically
pleasing restorative.Most prior art polishing discs used for finishing
composite materials have a metal fastener in the
center which is used for attaching the disc to a shaft
adapted to be used in a hand held polisher. If the
practitioner is not careful, the metal fastener could
come in contact with and mar the composite material.Prior art discs which are now used for shaping
composites have a tendancy to preferentially wear away
the composite material and pluck the more rigid filler
particles from the composite surface during the polishing
procedure. Some such prior art discs are so abrasive 
that they tend to flatten natural contours of the
tooth and even remove natural tooth structure when
finishing
