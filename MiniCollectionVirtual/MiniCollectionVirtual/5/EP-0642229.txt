<ABSTRACT>
Circuit for generating a line termination impedance with an analog impedance network (2) connected via a two-wire/four-wire converter (1) to the input and output ends of a given line (L) and with a digital impedance network (4) connected in parallel with the analog impedance network (2) with the intermediate connection of an analog-digital conversion device (3) and a digital-analog conversion device (5), the real part of the sum, multiplied by the transfer function (ZV) of the two-wire/four-wire converter (1), of the transfer function (AN) of the analog impedance network (2) and the product of the transfer functions (AD, DN, DA) of the analog-digital conversion device (3), digital impedance network (4) and the digital-analog conversion device (5) being greater than -1.

Circuit arrangement for generating a line
termination impedance with an analogue impedance

network (2), which is connected to a given line (L) on
the input side and on the output side via a two-wire/four-wire

converter (1), and with a digital
impedance network (4), which is connected in parallel

with the analogue impedance network (2) with the
interposition of an analogue-to-digital conversion

device (3) and a digital-to-analogue conversion device
(5), wherein the real part of the sum of the transfer

function (AN) of the analogue impedance network (2) and
of the product of the transfer functions (AD, DN, DA)

of analogue-to-digital conversion device (3), digital
impedance network (4) and digital-to-analogue

conversion device (5), which sum is multiplied by the
transfer function (ZV) of the two-wire/four-wire

converter (1), is greater than -1.
