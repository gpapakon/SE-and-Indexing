<ABSTRACT>
For producing a three-dimensional circuit arrangement, substrates (1a, 1b), arranged one above the other, are firmly connected to one another by means of recesses (2a, 2b) in the surfaces of the neighbouring substrates which recesses are filled, bordering on one another, (1a, 1b) with a mixture of two metal components (one of which being liquid and the other solid and of which the solid component dissolves in the liquid one, leading to the mixture hardening) by hardening the mixture (7a, 7b). In particular, individual components are arranged on prepared substrate disks and are firmly connected thereto.

in which at least two substrates (1a, 1b) that
comprise circuit structures are arranged above one

another as a stack, each pair of neighbouring
substrates representing an upper substrate (1a) and

a lower substrate (1b),
in which, in upper substrates (1a) which are each
arranged with their lower side directly on the upper

side of a lower substrate (1b), at least one indentation
(2a) which extends in the respective substrate

(1a) as far as a metallization plane (3a) and whose
side walls are provided with an insulation (4a), is

respectively produced on the lower side of the upper
substrate (1a),
in which, in the lower substrates (1b), at least one
indentation (2b) is respectively produced on the

upper side of the substrate (1b), this indentation
extending in the respective substrate (1b) as far as

a metallization plane (3b), having its side walls
provided with an insulation (4b) and being arranged

in such a way that, in the stack, they coincide with
a corresponding indentation (2a) in the upper

substrate (1a),
in which the indentations (2a, 2b) are each filled
with a mixture of two metal components, one of which

is liquid and the other of which is solid, and of
which the solid component dissolves in the liquid

component, which causes the mixture to set, and this
mixture is set producing a solid connection between 

adjacent substrates (1a, 1b).
Process according to Claim 1,

in which a support is bonded to the upper side of a
substrate wafer which comprises a multiplicity of

components,

metallization plane and whose side walls are

provided with an insulation, are produced in the
substrate wafer surface remote from the support,

way that the support points downwards,
in which the indentations in the substrate wafer are
filled with a mixture of two metal components, one

of which is liquid and the other of which is solid,
and of which the solid component dissolves in the

liquid component, which causes the mixture to set,

as an upper substrate on that surface of the substrate

wafer used as a lower substrate which is
remote from the support, the isolated component

having at least one indentation in the surface coinciding
with the upper side of the substrate wafer,

this indentation extending as far as a metallization
plane, having its side wall provided with an insulation,

being filled with a set mixture of two metal
components, one of which is liquid and the other of

which is solid, and of which the solid component
dissolves in the liquid component, which causes the

mixture to set, and coinciding with an indentation in
the upper side of the substrate wafer,
in which the as yet unset mixture of the two metal
components is set, producing a solid connection

between the component and the substrate wafer,
in which, after the substrate wafer has been divided
upto isolate component stacks, each of which

comprises an isolated component and a corresponding 
component from the substrate wafer, the support is

removed.
Process according to Claim 2,

in which at least one indentation per component is
produced in the surface of the substrate wafer

before the support is bonded on, this indentation
extending as far as a metallization plane, having

its side walls provided with an insulation, being
filled with a mixture of two metal components, one

of which is liquid and the other of which is solid,
and of which the solid component dissolves in the

liquid component, which causes the mixture to set,
which is set,
in which the component stacks remaining after the
substrate wafer has been divided up and the support

has been removed are arranged as upper substrates on
another correspondingly prepared substrate wafer as

the lower substrate, the indentations in the surface
of the component stack which are filled with a set

mixture of two metal components coinciding with
corresponding indentations on the upper side of the

further substrate wafer which are filled with an
unset mixture of two metal components, one of which

is liquid and the other of which is solid, and of
which the solid component dissolves in the liquid

component, which causes the mixture to set,
in which, by the mixture of two metal components
setting, the component stacks are firmly connected

to the other substrate wafer, and the other
substrate wafer is divided up to isolate component

stacks increased by one plane.
Process according to Claim 2 or 3,

components are provided with an indentation filled

with a set mixture of two metal components in such
a way that in the surface of a further substrate

wafer which comprises the components before
isolation, at least one indentation is produced per 

component, this indentation extending as far as a
metallization plane, having its side walls provided

with an insulation and being filled with a mixture
of two metal components, one of which is liquid and

the other of which is solid, and of which the solid
component dissolves in the liquid component, which

causes the mixture to set,
in which the components are isolated after the
mixture of two metal components has set.

metal components, one of which is liquid and the other of
which is solid, and of which the solid component dissolves
