<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a crusher (10) having a fixed crusher member (13) and a vertically reciprocating crusher member (11). Reciprocation of the crusher member (11) is achieved by a pivoting arm (35) located beneath the crusher member (11) which is preferably driven by a toggle mechanism (24) located to one side of the crusher (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CRUSHER TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to crushers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONKnown crushers such as that disclosed in Australian patent specification No. 67577/74, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated, have consisted of a first crusher member, which is of a conical configuration and which is caused to vertically reciprocate. Surrounding the first crusher member is a fixed crusher member, which has an internal surface of frusto-conical configuration. The first crusher member co-operates with the frusto-conical surface to provide a converging path along which the material to be crushed passes to be reduced in size.The above discussed known crushers have the disadvantage of requiring considerable height due to the drive arrangement for the first crusher member. OBJECT OF THE INVENTIONIt is the object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate the above disadvantage. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThere is disclosed herein a crusher comprising; a fixed crusher member having an internal fixed crushing surface of frusto-conical configuration tapering upwardly; a movable crusher member having an external surface of frusto-conical configuration tapering upwardly and being arranged with respect to the movable surface to define a downwardly converging space through which material to be crushed passes; motor means to cause longitudinal vertical reciprocation of the movable crusher member relative to a fixed crusher member, said motor means including a driven member pivotably mounted for osciallation about a generally horizontal axis and a first coupling extending between said driven member and said movable crusher member to cause said vertical reciprocation thereof.Preferably the motor means includes a drive beam 

 arranged for horizontal reciprocation and a second coupling extending between the drive and driven members to cause angular oscillation of the driven member on horizontal oscillation of the drive member.More preferably the drive member is eccentrically mounted on a rotating shaft so as to cause said horizontal reciprocation of the drive member on rotation of the shaft.More preferably the shaft is on one transverse side of the movable crusher member and the second coupling is on the other transverse side.Alternatively the drive member is located to one side of the movable crusher member. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGIn the accompanying drawing there is schematically depicted in sectioned side elevation, a crusher according to an embodiment of the

<CLAIMS>
The claims :
1. A crusher comprising; a fixed crusher member having an internal fixed crushing surface of frusto-conical configuration tapering upwardly; a movable crusher member having an external surface of frusto-conical configuration tapering upwardly and being arranged with respect to the movable surface to define a downwardly converging space through which material to be crushed passes; motor means to cause longitudinal vertical reciprocation of the movable crusher member relative to a fixed crusher member, said motor means including a driven member pivotably mounted for osciallation about a generally horizontal axis and a first coupling extending between said driven member and said movable crusher member to cause said vertical reciprocation thereof.
2. The crusher of claim 1 wherein the motor means further includes a drive beam arranged for horizontal reciprocation and a second coupling extending between the drive and driven members to cause angular oscillation of the driven member on horizontal oscillation of the drive member.
3. The crusher of claim 2 wherein the drive member is eccentrically mounted on a rotatable shaft to cause horizontal reciprocation of the drive member on rotation thereof.
4. The crusher of claim 2 or claim 3 wherein the shaft is on one transverse side of the movable crusher member and the second coupling is on the other transverse side.
5. The crusher of any one of claim 2 to 4 wherein the movable crusher member has a horizontally extending aperture passing therethrough and the drive member extends through the aperture.
6. The crusher of claim 2 or claim 3 wherein the drive member is located to one side of the movable crusher member.
7. The crusher of any one of claims 1 to 6 wherein the horizontal axis is vertically movable relative to the fixed crusher member to vary the size of the downwardly converging 


space .
8. The crusher of claim 7 wherein there is provided an adjusting member for varying the vertical position of the horizontal axis.
9. The crusher of any one of claims 1 to 8 wherein the lower crusher member is rotatable about a vertical axis relative to the upper crusher.
10. A crusher, substantially as herein described with reference to the drawings.
