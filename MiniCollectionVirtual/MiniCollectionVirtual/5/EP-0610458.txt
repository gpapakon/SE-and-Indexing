<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin treatment 
apparatus, used in various apparatuses operated by coins, 
such as an automatic vending machine and a public 
telephone, more particularly to the coin treatment 
apparatus of selecting various coins on the basis of each 
currency unit with different diameter, transferring them 
into a receiving space, and discharging those stored in 
the receiving space into a coin receiving box which is 
another receiving space as soon as a user finishes the use 
of the apparatus. Generally, a coin treatment apparatus sorts out the 
coins into each currency unit, selects them on the basis 
of the sorted information, and transfers them into a coin 
receiving space. At the bottom of the coin receiving 
space, a discharge plate for discharging a change and a 
path with a larger diameter than that of the coin to be 
received into the coin receiving space are formed. 
Therefore, the coins received in the receiving space are 
discharged through the path according to the linear 
movement of the discharge plate. However, such conventional coin treatment apparatuses 
have complicated construction because a mechanism for 
selecting the coins on the basis of each currency unit, 
discriminating the correct or incorrect coins, and 
transferring the selected coins to the receiving space are 
independently installed and these mechanisms have to be  
 
organically operated. Therefore, the disadvantage is that the malfunction of the 
coin treatment apparatus is frequently occurred. An example of a prior art 
construction can be found in US-A-4286703. An object of the present invention is to provide a coin treatment 
apparatus, which selects coins on the basis of each currency unit, transfers the 
coins to the corresponding receiving space, and collects the coins stored in the 
receiving space into another receiving box at the same time, in order to easily 
collect the coins. For achieving the above objective, various gates are installed, as many 
as the member of currency units, the gates are changed in the vertical or 
horizontal direction to select the coins by each currency unit according to the 
coin discrimination information and to transfer the coins to the corresponding 
receiving space, and paths through which the coins are moved are formed on one 
side of an arbitrary gate among the gates. Therefore, the coins of the smaller 
diameter among the coins passing through the paths fall down to the 
corresponding receiving space of each currency unit so that the remaining coins 
are

<CLAIMS>
A coin treatment apparatus, having a selection box (1) for selecting coins 
by sorting out whether such coins are correct or incorrect and transferring such 

coins to a corresponding receiving space and a receiving box (3) for storing the 
coins passing said selection box (1) and discharging a change, comprising: 


a plurality of gates (4a, 4b, 4c) installed on a base (5) within said 
selection box (1), wherein said gates change the coins in the vertical or 

horizontal direction by being projected from said base (5) or by being embedded 
into said base to select the coins by each currency unit and to transfer the coins 

to said corresponding receiving space, characterised by a plurality of projection 
dies (5a, 6a) and a guiding jaw (6b) formed on said base (5) and a cover (6) 

within said selection box (1), wherein said projection dies and said guiding jaw 
form a coin transfer path in order to separate again the coins passing through an 

arbitrary gate among said gates by each currency unit and to collect the coins; 
and 
a push die (5b) and an inclination surface (5j, 5c) formed on said base (5) 
and said cover (6), wherein said push die (5b) and said inclination surface incline 

the coins of smaller diameter among the coins passing through said coin transfer 
path in order to fall down into a receiving container (7a - 7d). 
The coin treatment apparatus of Claim 1, characterised in that said 
selection box (1) comprises a plurality of dampers (11a, 11b) for reducing the 

momentum of the coins, a sorter section (12) for sorting out whether the inserted 
coins are correct or incorrect, and a selecting and transferring section (11a, 11b) 

by each currency unit and transferring the coins to the receiving space.  
 
The coin treatment apparatus of Claim 1, characterised in that said gate 
(4a, 4c) comprises a horizontal control piece (46a) for controlling the horizontal 

movement with a gap between said horizontal control piece and said base 
through which said coins can pass, and a vertical control piece (46b) close to 

said base for controlling the vertical movement of the coins. 
The coin treatment apparatus of Claim 1 or Claim 2, further comprising 
a removing plate (9) at the bottom of a plurality of discharge plates (8a - 8d) 

which discharges the coins stored in receiving containers (7a to 7d) within said 

receiving box (3), for discharging simultaneously all the coins stored in said 
receiving containers, characterised in that said removing plate (9) is arranged for 

linear reciprocating movement in the opposite direction to that of the discharge 
plates and having holes (9a) corresponding to holes (8) of said discharge plates. 
The coin treatment apparatus of Claim 3, characterised in that said 
removing plate (9) is formed by a single plate.
