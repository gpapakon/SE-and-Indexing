<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved aqueous composition for coating a
variety of substrates. In particular, this invention is directed to an aqueous coating
composition of a crosslinked self-stabilized latex of a graft copolymer which is
particularly useful as the pigmented color coat of a color coat/clear coat finish that is
used as an exterior finish on automobiles and trucks.Automobiles and trucks have exterior finishes for several well known
reasons. First, such finishes provide barrier protection against corrosion. Second,
consumers prefer an exterior finish having an attractive aesthetic finish, including high
gloss and excellent DOI (distinctness of image).The exterior surface of a typical automobile or truck has several layers
of finishes or coatings. If the substrate is steel, it typically is first coated with an
inorganic rust-proofing zinc or iron phosphate layer over which is provided a primer
which can be an electrocoated primer or a repair primer. Optionally, a primer surfacer
can be applied to provide for better appearance and/or improved adhesion. A
pigmented basecoat or color coat is next applied over the primer. A typical basecoat or
color coat contains a mixture of pigments, which may include metallic flake pigments in
the case of a metallic finish. In order to protect and preserve the aesthetic qualities of
the finish on the vehicle, it is well known to provide a clear (unpigmented) topcoat or
clear coat over the colored (pigmented) basecoat, so that the basecoat remains
unaffected even on prolonged exposure to the environment or weathering.Aqueous coating compositions of a self-stabilized latex of a graft
copolymer which can be pigmented and used as a basecoat in a clear coat/base coat
finish for automobile and trucks is shown in WO-A-9532229
which discloses an aqueous coating composition comprising an
aqueous carrier and a binder wherein the binder comprises a
graft copolymer consisting of i) a polymeric backbone of
ethylenically unsaturated monomers and ii) macromonomers which
are attached to the backbone, contain carboxylic acid 
functionality and have a weight average molecular weight of
500-30000, and a crosslinking agent (cf. claims 1-8). The
polymeric backbone of the graft copolymer may be crosslinked,
e.g. by diacrylate monomeric units (cf. page 7, lines 6-9).
Similar compositions are known from WO-A-9532255 (cf. claims
1-8; page 6, lines 34/35).While the coating compositions disclosed in the two WO
applications are adequate, there is need of improvement in
chip resistance
