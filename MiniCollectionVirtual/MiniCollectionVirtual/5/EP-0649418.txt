<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds, processes for their preparation,
pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods of treatment involving their
use.International Patent Application No. WO 92/08708 (published after the priority
date of this application) discloses a number of biologically active amines and their
activity as β2-adrenoreceptor agonists and dopamine DA2-agonists.We have now found a group of 7-(2-aminoethyl)-benzothiazolone derivatives
which exhibit significant advantages over those known from the prior art.According to the invention there are provided compounds of formula I,

wherein
X and Y independently represent -S(O)n- or -O-,n represents 0, 1 or 2,p, q and r independently represent 2 or 3,Z represents phenyl optionally substituted by halogen, hydroxyl, methoxy,
nitro or amino, or represents a pyridyl or thienyl group,
   and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.According to the invention we also provide a process for the production of a
compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which
comprises
a) alkylation of a compound of formula II, 

with an alkylating agent of formula III,
L-(CH2)p-X-(CH2)q-Y-(CH2)r-Z
   in which p, q, r, X, Y and Z are as defined above and L represents a leaving
group,b) alkylation of a compound of formula II, as defined above, with a compound of
formula IV,
O=CH-(CH2)p-1-X-(CH2)q-Y-(CH2)r-Z
   in which p, q, r, X, Y and Z are as defined above,
   in the presence of a reducing agent,c) selective reduction of a compound of formula V,

   in which p, q, r, X, Y and Z are as defined above,d) selective reduction of a compound of formula Va, 

   in which p, q, r, X, Y and Z are as defined above,e) removal of a protecting group from a corresponding protected compound of
formula I in which one or more of the functional groups is protected,
   and where desired or necessary converting the resulting compound of formula I
to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or vice versa.In process a) leaving groups which L may represent include halide, such as
chloride, bromide and iodide, and alkyl or arylsulphonyloxy groups such as
methanesulphonyloxy or p-toluenesulphonyloxy. The reaction is preferably carried out
in the presence of a base, e.g. an inorganic base such as sodium or potassium carbonate,
or an organic base such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine or pyridine. The
reaction is conveniently performed in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. tetrahydrofuran or
dioxan, a ketone, e.g. butanone or methyl
