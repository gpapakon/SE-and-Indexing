<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are useful for drying industrial casks (60). The industrial casks (60) are set on a slanting base (12, 20) and are enclosed in a pressure-tight vacuum hood (30). A suction hose (40) linked to the vacuum hood (30) extends through a bunghole (63) of the slanting cask (60) down to its deepest point (71), at which a residual amount of liquid (70) is collected. A heating rod (55) is arranged in the suction hose (40). The suction hose (40) is connected to a vacuum pump (48). The heated suction hose (40) sucks at first the liquid residual amount (70) then the evaporating residual liquid from the inside of the cask (60). Compared with the conventional drying process with overheated steam, lower costs and an improved drying are achieved.

A method for drying hollow bodies having an access opening, 
in particular for drying industrial barrels (60) after 

washing, wherein at least one hollow body is tilted and 
a residual liquid quantity (70) being still contained in 

the hollow body and having gathered at a lowest point (71) 
thereof is removed from the hollow body by means of a 

suction nozzle (40) introduced through the access opening, 
characterized by the steps of: 


a) positioning the hollow body in a vacuum space with 
the access opening pointing to the top; 
b) evacuating the hollow body to a predetermined vacuum 
pressure level by means of the suction nozzle (40) 

having been introduced into the hollow body from 
above; 
c) simultaneously heating the suction nozzle (40); and 
d) re-ventilating the hollow body at the end of a 
predetermined period of time. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that a vacuum hood 
(30) is placed on top the hollow body.  

 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that a vacuum hood 
(30') is placed on top a plurality of hollow bodies, the 

suction nozzle being configured as a multiple suction nozzle 
entering the barrels at the same moment in time. 
The method of claim 1, characterized in that a plurality 
of hollow bodies are run through a vacuum tunnel (80). 
The method of one or more of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the residual liquid quantity (70) is drawn off 

by means of a vacuum pump (48). 
The method of one or more of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the volume ratio between the vacuum space (30) 

and the hollow body is between 1,5 and 2,0. 
The method of one or more of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the vacuum pressure level is adjusted to a value 

below the saturation pressure of the residual water, 
preferably to between 10 mbar and 25 mbar. 
The method of one or more of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that dry air, preferably dried compressed air, is used 

for re-ventilation. 
An apparatus for drying hollow bodies having an access 
opening and being positioned on an inclined support (12, 

20), in particular for drying industrial barrels (60) after 
washing, the apparatus comprising support means for at 

least one hollow body and a suction nozzle (40) as well 
as displacement means for introducing the suction nozzle 

(40) into the access opening such that the terminal end 
of the suction nozzle (40) comes to lie at the lowest point 

(71) within the hollow body, characterized by  
 


a) a vacuum space chamber to which the suction nozzle 
(40) is attached, the suction nozzle (40) being 

adapted, by said displacement means, to be brought 
in a down
ward direction into a first position in which 
the suction nozzle (40) is introduced into the access 

opening from above, as well as in an upward direction 
into a second position in which it is completely 

withdrawn from the hollow body; 
b) a vacuum pump (48) for generating a vacuum pressure 
in the hollow body; and 
c) heating means (55 - 58) for the suction nozzle (40). 
The apparatus of claim 9, characterized in that the suction 
nozzle (40) is attached to a vacuum hood (30) which, in 

the first position, encloses the hollow body positioned 
on the support (12, 20) in a pressure-tight manner while, 

in the second position, it fully releases the hollow body. 
The apparatus of claim 10, characterized in that the vacuum 
hood (30) encloses a plurality of hollow bodies in the 

first position. 
The apparatus of claim 9, characterized in that suction 
nozzles (40) are provided in the area of a vacuum tunnel 

(80) through which the hollow bodies are run. 
The apparatus of one or more of claims 9 to 12, characterized 
in that the volume ratio between the vacuum space 

(30) and the hollow body is between 1,5 and 2,0.  
 
The apparatus of one or more of claims 9 to 13, characterized 
in that the suction nozzle (40) comprises a reventilation 

valve (49). 
The apparatus of one or more of claims 9 to 14, characterized 
in that the inclined support (12, 20) forms an angle 

(α + β) of between 5° and 20°, preferably 15°, with a 
horizontal line. 
The apparatus of one or more of claims 9 to 15, characterized 
in that the vacuum pump (48) is a water ring pump.
