<ABSTRACT>
Device for withdrawing (delivering) granules (pills), contained in a container (10) of the type comprising a dispenser body (1) consisting of two identical parallel cylindrical parts A and B joined together by a spindle (2), the said parts A, B having cutouts (4) which are offset from a part A to the other B; - a cylindrical washer (6) having a radial slot connected to an axial passage (7) designed to interact with the axle (2), and at least one axial recess (8) for allowing products to pass from the first part A to the second B, the said washer (6) having a diameter slightly larger than the internal diameter of the neck of the container so as to allow it to be fitted tightly onto the circular end of the container; - a receptacle cap (11) which fits onto the circular mouth of the container and has means (12, 17) for driving the dispenser body in rotation, and in which the first part A, the second part B and the washer (6) have a thickness slightly greater than the diameter of a product.

A device for withdrawing spherical products of the same 
dimensions, such as granules, contained in a container (10) 

exhibiting a cylindrical neck and a circular mouth, of the type 
comprising: 


a body (1) for dispensing products, this body consisting of 
two parallel cylindrical parts A, B, respectively a first part A and a 

second part B, joined together by a spindle (2), said cylindrical 
parts A, B exhibiting notches (4) intended to receive a product, 

said notches (4) being offset from one part A to the other B so that 
a solid section (3) of one part A corresponds to a notch (4) in the 

other part B; 
a cylindrical roundel (6) exhibiting a radial slit connected to 
an axial passage (7) intended to interact with the spindle (2), and at 

least one axial recess (8) to allow the products to pass from the first 
part A to the second part B, said roundel (6) having a diameter 

slightly greater than the internal diameter of the neck of the 
container to allow tight fitting at the circular end of the container; 
a receptacle stopper (11) fitting onto the circular mouth of 
the container and exhibiting means (12, 17) for driving the 

dispensing body in terms of rotation, 
characterized in that
: 

the first part A and second part B are identical; 
and the first part A, the second part B and the roundel (6) 
have a thickness slightly greater than the diameter of a product. 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
radial slit in the roundel (6) is composed of a central axial passage 

(7) proper, designed to clip over the spindle (2) of the dispensing 
body (1), and the axial slit proper is flared into the shape of a sector 

of a cylinder in order to form the recess (8) designed to receive a 
product. 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the cylindrical roundel (6) bears, inside the 

neck, on rests (20) formed for this purpose on the internal face of 
the neck. 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the cylindrical roundel (6) on one of the two 

edges, exhibits a collar (9) for bearing on the circular mouth of the 
container (10). 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the solid angles of intersection of the notches (4) of the 

dispensing body (1) and of the recess (8) in the roundel (6) are 
chamfered. 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the inclination of the chamfer on the external faces of each 

of the two parts of the dispensing body (1), is greater than that of 
the internal chamfer.  

 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the means for driving the dispensing body (1) in terms of 

rotation consists of: 

a central pivot (14) located inside the receptacle stopper (11) 
on the axis of symmetry of the stopper, said pivot (14) exhibiting a 

driving shape (17) at its end; 
and a complementary shape (16) located at the center of the 
external face of each of the two parts A, B of the dispensing body 

(1). 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 

in that the solid sectors (3) of the two parts A, B of the dispensing 
body (1) are provided with at least one driving tooth (5) situated 

on their external face ending in the receptacle, and the receptacle 
(10) is provided on its internal partition with an annulus gear (12) 

situated in a plane parallel to the faces of the dispenser in order to 
rotate the latter through meshing with the teeth (5) of its external 

face. 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the notches (4) of the dispensing body (1) consist of three 

evenly spaced radial sectors. 
The device as claimed in one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the receptacle stopper (10) is made of a 

transparent plastic substance and the container (10) containing the 
granules is a cylindrical tube made of a colored plastic substance.
