<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic recording and reproducing 
apparatus for reproducing a video signal recorded on a 

video track of a magnetic tape by means of a pair of 
magnetic heads arranged in a rotation drum so as to 

oppose to each other at an angle of 180 degrees, while 
rotating a capstan for moving the magnetic tape in the 

longitudinal direction, a memory controller controls the 
reproduced video signal to be written into and be read 

out from two memories, each of which stores a video 
signal of at least one field. Then, a quality of image 

judgment circuit judges a part of the reproduced video 
signal having a quality of image higher than a 

predetermined threshold quality level, among a plurality 
of parts of the reproduced video signal obtained through 

scan of a pair of magnetic heads. In a slow-motion 
reproduction, the memory control circuit controls the 

part of the reproduced video signal having the higher 
quality of image to be written into one of the two 

memories, whereas the memory control circuit 
simultaneously controls a further reproduced video signal 

to be read out from another one of the two memories.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic
recording and reproducing apparatus such as a VTR (Video
Tape Recorder), and in particular, to a magnetic
recording and reproducing apparatus performing a slow-motion
reproduction so as to reproduce a higher quality
of image.In recent years, a magnetic recording and
reproducing apparatus has been used not only in executing
normal recording and reproducing operations but also in
analyzing an image or producing a software tape through a
special reproducing process, which has also accompanied a
growing trend of attaching importance to the quality of a
specially reproduced image.In a magnetic recording and reproducing
apparatus most widely used using a magnetic tape (the
magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus is referred
to as a VTR hereinafter), a magnetic tape is wound around
a rotating drum mounted together with magnetic heads, and
a video signal is recorded onto a video track inclined at 
a specified angle with respect to the longitudinal
direction of a magnetic tape. Such a VTR is referred to
as a helical scan type VTR hereinafter.When a slow-motion reproduction is executed in
the helical scan type VTR, the inclination of a recorded
video track does not coincide with a scanning trace of
the magnetic head. This results in a deviation or shift
amount on the time of a video signal, or a deteriorated
signal-to-noise ratio in a part of the resulting image.
Therefore, in order to obtain a stabilized slow-motion
image in a simpler manner, it is required to repeat
reproduction of a still image by intermittently feeding
the magnetic tape periodically, or periodically stopping
the moved magnetic tape. Further, in order to obtain a
perfect slow-motion image having a higher quality, it is
required to move the magnetic head mounted on the
rotating drum in a direction perpendicular to the
direction of rotation of the rotating drum and to effect
control so as to correctly scan the recorded video track
on the magnetic tape.Fig. 16 shows a reproducing system of a
conventional helical scan type VTR having a head driving
mechanism 1605 for moving the magnetic head.Referring to Fig. 16, 1601 denotes a magnetic
tape, and the reproducing system of the conventional VTR
comprises a magnetic head 1602, a preamplifier 1603, a 
video signal reproducing circuit 1604, the head driving
mechanism 1605, a head driving circuit 1606, a level
detecting circuit 1607, and a controller 1608.When a slow-motion reproduction is executed in
the conventional VTR shown in Fig. 16, a RF (radio
