<ABSTRACT>
A high-frequency use non-reciprocal circuit includes a 
sintered body (18) which is a high-frequency use magnetic 

body obtained by a ceramic lamination/integral firing 
technique, a plurality of central electrodes (8a, 8b to 10a, 

10b) which are arranged in the sintered body (18) to be 
separated from each other through a magnetic layer while 

intersecting with each other at central portions, and 
electrodes (11a to 16b) for deriving impedance-matching 

capacitance which are formed in the vicinity of the 
intersecting portion to be in series with the central 

electrodes (8a, 8b to 10a, 10b). The magnetic layer 
provided between the central electrodes serves as an 

insulating layer for electrically insulating the central 
electrodes from each other, a high-frequency use magnetic 

layer, and a material layer for deriving the impedance-matching 
capacitance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-reciprocal
circuit element which is employed in a high frequency band
of about 0.5 to 3 GHz, for example, and more particularly,
it relates to a high-frequency non-reciprocal circuit
element which is integrally provided with impedance-matching
capacitance. The high-frequency non-reciprocal circuit
element according to the present invention is applied to a
lumped parameter circulator or isolator, for example.Integration of a high-frequency circuit is recently
progressed in relation to mobile communication or the like,
and hence miniaturization, cost reduction and improvement in
reliability are required for a non-reciprocal circuit element
which is employed for such an integrated circuit.The non-reciprocal circuit element, such as a lumped
parameter circulator or isolator, for example, comprises a
plurality of central electrodes which are electrically insulated
from each other by an insulator layer and arranged to
intersect with each other, a high-frequency magnetic
body which is arranged on an intersectional portion of the
central electrodes, and a permanent magnet for applying a dc 
magnetic field to the intersectional portion, with formation
of impedance-matching capacitance, for example.Fig. 6 is a perspective view for illustrating an
exemplary step of assembling a conventional high-frequency
use non-reciprocal circuit element. In order to assemble
the high-frequency use non-reciprocal circuit element, a
central electrode 124a of metal foil such as Cu foil, for
example, is first arranged on a discoidal high-frequency use
magnetic body 123a.The central electrode 124a radially extends along an
upper surface of the high-frequency use magnetic body 123a
through its center, to reach side surfaces of the magnetic
body 123a.Then, an insulating film 125a of an insulating material
is arranged on the central electrode 124a, and another
central electrode 124b is arranged thereon to intersect with
the central electrode 124a. Further, another insulating
film 125b, still another central electrode 124c and still
another insulating film 125c are successively stacked on the
central electrode 124b, and a high-frequency use magnetic
body 123b is stacked on the uppermost portion.The high-frequency use non-reciprocal circuit element
which is assembled in the aforementioned manner is combined
with a permanent magnet, yokes holding the permanent magnet
and the like to form a circulator or an isolator, as shown 
in Fig. 7 in an exploded perspective view.Referring to Fig. 7, a
