<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiographic installation with a number of components, which are in each case allocated a data transmission node corresponding to the CAN protocol, the data input and output of which interact with other data transmission nodes via transmitters and receivers, the data transmission nodes being connected to the components allocated to them in each case via lines. Fast and reliable data transmission is ensured by the fact that transmitters and receivers of at least some data transmission nodes are constructed for wireless transmission and that these transmitters and receivers are driven in such a manner that they transmit data at least to the wireless receivers of other data transmission nodes or can receive data from the wireless transmitters of at least the other data transmission nodes.

<CLAIMS>
An X-ray device comprising a number of components to each of which is
assigned a data transmission node working by the CAN protocol whose data input and

data output are in mutual communication with other data transmission nodes 
via

transmitters and receivers, the data transmission nodes being connected to the relevant
associated components through connection lines,

characterized in that the transmitter (T) and receiver (R) of at least some of the data

transmission nodes (9, 10) are constructed for wireless transmission, and in that these
transmitters or receivers are so controlled that they transmit data to at least the wireless

receivers of other data transmission nodes and receive data from the wireless
transmitters of at least the other data transmission nodes, as applicable.
An X-ray device as claimed in claim 1,

characterized in that the transmitters and receivers for the wireless data transmission are
light transmitters and light receivers, preferably infrared transmitters and infrared

receivers.
An X-ray device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that a wireless transmitter (8, T) which can reach the other wireless
receivers or a wireless receiver (8, R) which can receive data from the other wireless

transmitters is connected to a line bus system to which at the same time several data
transmission nodes (1, 2, 3) are connected.
