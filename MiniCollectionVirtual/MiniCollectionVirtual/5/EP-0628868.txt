<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photographic
elements containing magenta couplers comprising a
parent 1-phenyl-3-anilino-pyrazol-5-one and a
phenylthio coupling-off group with both the parent and
coupling-off group containing substituents providing
improved hue, speed of dye formation and reduced
staining.The use of magenta couplers comprising 1-phenyl-3-anilino-pyrazol-5-one
couplers containing
phenylthio coupling-off groups at the 4-position are
well known in the art. See for example U.S. Patent
4,853,319 of Krishnamurthy et al. and other patents
cited therein. While elements employing such couplers
have provided certain advantages, there remain several
shortcomings in photographic elements relying on these
types of magenta couplers.These shortcomings relate to the dye-forming
efficiency of the coupler, the speed with which the dye
is formed, the dye hue, and the undesirable occurrence
of staining during processing. Compositions disclosed
in the mentioned U.S. Patent 4,853,319 contain an ortho
carbonamido substituent on the phenylthio coupling-off
group of the magenta coupler. It has been found that
compounds of this type provide disadvantages in terms
of the speed of dye formation and staining.The dye forming efficiency of the coupler is
affected by many factors such as the extent to which
the parent portion of the coupler is ballasted so as to
retain its proper position in the photographic element 
in order to optimize the image recorded. If the
coupler parent is not sufficiently ballasted, it is
free to wander both horizontally and vertically during
processing thereby adversely affecting both sharpness
and color rendition. Moreover, the coupler is
susceptible to being washed out of the element entirely
and thus contributing no dye density to the image.
Therefore, this problem is to be avoided.The dye efficiency can also be affected by
the coupling-off group. If the coupling-off group is
able to migrate upon release and if it is capable of
interfering in the desired chain of reactions that
allows the reduction of silver to transform a
corresponding amount of coupler to dye, then the
coupling-off group can itself cause a reduction in dye
formation efficiency.The speed with which the dye is formed can
present added problems. When a coupler undergoes
coupling with a color developer to form a dye, the
coupler goes through an intermediate stage wherein the
oxidized developer and the coupling-off group are both
annexed to the coupler parent. This intermediate is a
leuco dye which is uncolored until the
