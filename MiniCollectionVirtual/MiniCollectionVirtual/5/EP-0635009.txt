<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain derivatives of 2,3-dihydro-benzofuranol 
; to the intermediates and processes 
useful for their preparation, to their ability to manifest 
the property of being free radical scavengers, and to their 
end-use application in the treatment of disease conditions 
capable of being ameliorated by free radical scavengers 
such as, for example, stroke, nervous system trauma or 
reperfusion damage. EP-A-0 413 668 and FR-A-2 634 766 already disclose 
certain derivatives of 2,3-dihydro-5-benzofuranols as 
antioxidants and free radical scavengers. The present invention relates to novel derivatives of 
2,3-dihydro-5-benzofuranols which contain specific 
substituents in positions 2 and 3 of the benzofuran 
skeleton. More specifically this invention relates to compounds 
of the formula 
 
   the steroisomers and mixtures thereof, and their 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein  
 
R2is C1-4 alkyl or both R2 moieties, when taken together 
with the carbon atom to which they are attached, form a

and branched chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl moieties 
having the indicated number of carbon atoms, preferably 
methyl or ethyl, but including others such as propyl, 
isopropyl, n-butyl and the like. The term -C(O)R includes 
moieties wherein R is H or a C1-9 alkyl moiety, embracing, 
for example, formyl, methylcarbonyl, ethylcarbonyl,  
 
propylcarbonyl and the like. The -NR7R9 moieties include the
