<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a manually operated device for winding a windable element. It will apply particularly to the winding of cable, rope (cable), film, fabric, cloth, tarpaulin or the like about a shaft or drum. The device of the invention comprises:   a manoeuvring handle (7) acting on a mechanism (8) for driving the shaft or drum (9), first snap-fit means (10) for, on the one hand, selecting a direction of rotation for the said shaft or drum (9) and for, on the other hand, enabling it to rotate in one direction and blocking it in the other, second snap-fit means (11) interacting with the said first means (10) in order to drive the said shaft or drum (9) in rotation in the said permitted direction, by oscillation of the manoeuvring handle (7), and in order to permit the return of the handle (7) towards its point of departure, the said rotation then being blocked by the said first means (10).

Manually operated device (6) for winding a windable item (5), such 
as, for example, a cable, rope, film, web, canvas or tarpaulin, about a shaft or 

drum (9), including : 

a mechanism (8) for driving the shaft or drum (9), constituted by a 
toothed pinion (14) secured directly or indirectly to the said shaft or drum (9), 

which is rotationally mobile ; 
an operating handle (7, 34), pivotally mounted, acting upon the said 
mechanism (8) ; 
first and second locking means (10, 11), co-operating with one 
another, for selecting a direction of rotation for the said shaft or drum (9) and 

for driving the said shaft or drum (9) in rotation in the said direction by pivoting 
the operating handle ;
 
characterised by the fact that the said means (10, 11) include : 
a rocker means (15) with two catches (16, 17) provided for co-operating 
with the said toothed pinion (14) to constitute the said first locking 

means (10), the said rocker means (15) being mounted so as to be mobile 
about an axis (22) and having a return spring (23) one of the ends (24) of 

which is fixed and the other end (26)of which is integral with the rocker 
means (15), the longitudinal axis (28) of the spring and the imaginary axis 

passing through the fixed end (24) of the spring and the articulation (22) of the 
said rocker means (15) being concurrent, so as to permit the said selection of 

the direction of rotation, according to two stable positions, the said catches 
(16, 17) of the said rocker means (15) each having, on one side, an inclined 

portion (30, 32), capable of permitting rotation of the pinion (14) in a first 
direction and, on the other side, a steep portion (31, 33) capable of coming to 

bear on the flanks of the teeth of the said pinion (14) in order to block the said 
rotation in the other direction ; 
a reversible catch (35), provided at the end of the operating handle (7, 
34) for co-operating with the said toothed pinion (14) to constitute the said 

second locking means (11), the said catch (35) defining a snug having, on  
 

one side, a slope, capable of permitting the rearward return to its point of 
departure of the said operating handle (7, 34), the said rotation then being 

blocked by the said rocker means (15) and, on the other side, a steep portion, 
capable of bearing on the teeth of the pinion (14) so as to permit the said 

driving in rotation in the said permitted direction. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the said 
operating handle (7) has a lever (34). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the said 
shaft of drum (9) is coaxial and associated with the toothed pinion (14). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that the said 
lever (34) is mounted for rotation, at least partial, about a pin (20, 21) and the 

said toothed pinion (14). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that the said 
rocker means (15) with two catches (16, 17) and the reversible catch (35) of 

the lever (34) are disposed on either side of the toothed pinion (14). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the said 
rocker means (15) is mounted so as to be mobile in a fixed yoke (18, 19, 25), 

the said end (24) of the spring (23) being integral with the said yoke (18, 19, 
25). 
Device according to claim 2, characterised by the fact that the 
reversible catch (35) is provided at the end of the lever (34), and mounted 

mechanically in this area, in order to permit a rotation of at least 180Â° of the 
catch (35) about its longitudinal axis (37). 
Device according to claim 7, characterised by the fact that the catch 
(35) is borne by a piston (38), and biased by a spring (39) towards the toothed 

pinion (14), the said piston (38) and the lever (34) being capable of being 
rotationally separated from one another, at least temporarily, to permit 

reversibility of the snug (35). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised by the fact that the rocker 
means (15) has an upper catch (16) and a lower catch (17), disposed in a C 

shape, acting respectively on the upper portion of the pinion (14) and its lower  
 

portion, each catch (16, 17) co-operating with the pinion (14), with the choice 
of catch (16, 17) engaging with the gear (14) selecting the said permitted 

direction (12 or 13).
