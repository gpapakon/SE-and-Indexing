<ABSTRACT>
In a moving picture decoding control system, when the amount of 
codes accumulated in a buffer memory is between first and second 

thresholds, the reading-out of the buffer memory is stopped and an image 
memory is repeatedly read out just after the I-picture or the P-picture of 

one frame is decoded until the amount of codes accumulated in the buffer 
memory exceeds the second threshold. When the amount of codes 

accumulated in the buffer memory is smaller than the first threshold, the 
reading-out of the buffer memory is stopped and the image memory is 

repeatedly read out until the amount of codes accumulated in the buffer 

memory exceeds the second threshold.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a decoding system for
decoding image codes and having a code buffer memory and an
image memory for matching in speed between a transmission rate
and a decoding rate of encoded data. More specifically, the
present invention relates to a system for controlling the code
buffer memory and the image memory when the code amount
becomes out of an ordinary capacity of the code buffer memory.From EP-O 588 586 A2, a moving picture decoding control
apparatus is known. This control apparatus has an emphasis on
error correction of video signals. Further, the video code
buffer overflow is not sufficiently handled with this
solution.In encoding moving pictures, a code buffer memory has been
used for matching in speed between a transmission rate and a
decoding rate of encoded data. If the decoding rate of the
encoded data is lower than the transmission rate of the
encoded data, the encoded data is accumulated in the code
buffer memory, and therefore, there is a fear that the code 
buffer memory overflows. If because of the overflow of the
code buffer memory the encoded data is not stored in the code
buffer memory and therefore is lost, it becomes impossible to
continue the decoding. There is possibility that a substantial
time is required until a normal operation is restored.Therefore, in the case that there is a fear that the code
buffer memory overflows, it is necessary to thin out the
encoded data stored in 
the code buffer memory, in units which is hard to influence the decoding,
for example, in units of one frame, so that an image stored in the image
memory is outputted in place of a decoded image to be properly
outputted. With this countermeasure, the encoded data stored in the code
buffer memory can be reduced.On the other hand, if the decoding rate of the encoded data is higher
than the transmission rate of the encoded data, the encoded data stored in
the code buffer memory will reduce, and therefore, there is a fear that the
code buffer memory underflows. If the encoded data stored in the code
buffer memory because of the underflow of the code buffer memory is
lost, it becomes impossible to output a decoded image, so that the image
becomes broken. Therefore, in order to avoid a break of the image,
when there is a fear that the code buffer memory underflows, it is
necessary to stop supplying the encoded data stored in the code buffer
memory to a decoding unit, and to output an image stored in the image
memory of the decoding unit, in place of a decoded image to be properly
output
