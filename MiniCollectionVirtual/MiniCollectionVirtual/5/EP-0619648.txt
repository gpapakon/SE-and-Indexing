<ABSTRACT>
In a circuit for the attenuation of a digital audio signal during short disturbances, particularly during a temporary trial reception of another transmitter, the audio signal is multiplied by a factor which is brought from a maximum value to a minimum value in accordance with a predetermined time function before the occurrence of a disturbance and is brought back to the maximum value after the disturbance.

Circuit arrangement for attenuating a digital
audio signal while brief disturbances are occurring, in

particular during a temporary attempt to receive a
different transmitter, characterized in that the audio

signal is multiplied in multipliers (3, 4) by a factor
(k) which, before a disturbance occurs, is changed from

a maximum value to a minimum value in accordance with a
predetermined time function and, after a disturbance,

is changed back to the maximum value, and in that the
attenuation is carried out on a logarithmic scale,

starting with the maximum value of the factor (k),
initially with a flat profile, and then increasingly

more steeply, and starting with the minimum value,
initially steeply and then becoming increasingly

flatter.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 1,
characterized in that an integrator (7, 8) is provided

to form the factor (k).
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the integrator comprises an adder

(7) and a delay (8) of preferably one sampling period.
Circuit arrangement according to Claim 3,
characterized in that a variable which in each case

represents an integration increment, and the derived
factor (k) from the previous sampling period can be

supplied to the adder (7) in that the output signal
from the adder (7), can be supplied, delayed by one

sampling period, to one input of a multiplier (9) and 
to one input of a comparator (10), in which case a

constant which represents the minimum value can be
applied to another input of the comparator (10), and in

that one output of the comparator (10) is connected to
a further input of the multiplier (9) at whose output

the derived factor (k) is present.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the

mathematical sign of an integration increment can be
controlled with the aid of a supplied control signal.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the magnitude

of an integration increment can be changed with the aid
of a further supplied control signal.
Circuit arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the audio

signal (L) of a left stereo channel and the audio
signal (R) of a right stereo channel are multiplied by

the factor (k).
