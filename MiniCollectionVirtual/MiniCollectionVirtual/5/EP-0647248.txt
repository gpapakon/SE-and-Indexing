, m, n and p are as defined, particularly where the alk(en)yl group is a C14 to C22 group, are effective surfactants. They are especially notable because, very surprisingly, the cloud point tends to rise with increasing alk(en)yl group chain lenght. The surfactants are effective in scouring wool and inverting polyacrylamide water in oil emulsions into water.

<DESCRIPTION>
SURFACTANTS DERIVED FROM POLYOXYALKYLENES AND SUBSITUTED SUCCINIC ANHYDRIDES.This invention relates to surfactants and in particular to novel surfactants based on derivatives of substituted succinic acids and to particular end uses for these surfactants.In recent years there has been an increasing desire to replace well established surfactants with materials of increased biodegrad- ability. There is, however, great practical difficulty in devising alternatives to substances of excellent performance which have maintained an important position in the market for several decades.EP 0107199 B relates to polvoxyalkylene glycol hemi-esters of CQ to C12 alk(en)yl substituted succinic acids and their salts. These materials are described as anionic surfactants with particular utility at acidic pHs and having hard water tolerance.This invention is based on the discovery of compounds which can be derived from alkenyl succinic anhydrides having particularly C14 to C22 alk(en)yl groups and/or substituents of functional groups elsewhere around the molecule give materials which have significantly and surprisingly different properties. In particular they perform well as non-ionic surfactants, particularly in aqueous systems, having unexpected cloud point properties indicating good performance at elevated temperatures and have good behaviour in alkaline conditions. Also the surfactants of this invention have good biodegradation properties.The present invention accordingly provides a compound of the formulae (I) or (II):Y.A1.0C.(H )C.C(H ?-).C0.A.(CmH2m0)n. 2 (I)where one of R and R1 is C5 to C22 alkenyl or alkyl and the other is hydrogen;A is - 0 - or - R^ -; where R^ is hydrogen or Ci to C alkyl, particularly methyl or ethyl; n is 2 to 100 (and as it is an average it may be non-integral); m is 2 or 3 (and may vary along the polvoxyalkylene chain); 

 R2 is hydrogen or C]_ to C5 alkyl; A1 is - 0 -, - 0- or -NR4- where R4 is hydrogen or C*|_ to C5 alkyl, particularly methyl or ethyl; such that when A**- is - 0":Y is a cation, particularly H+, and alkali metal cation especially a sodium or potassium cation, or an ammonium ion (especially NHz,-*", an amine ammonium or an alkanolamine ammonium ion); and when A1 is - 0 - or -NR4-:Y is a C*_ to Cs alkyl group (R3) or a group of the formula (CmH2m°)n-^ where m, n and R2 are independently as defined above; provided that when A is - 0 - or A1 is - 0~ the total number of carbon atoms in the groups R, R1 and any groups R2 and R3 is at least 13, and is desirably 13 to 50; orY.Ai.OC.
