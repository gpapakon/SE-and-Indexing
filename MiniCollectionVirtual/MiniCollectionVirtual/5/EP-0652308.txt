<ABSTRACT>
In order to form a single-crystalline thin film on a polycrystalline substrate 
using plasma CVD, a downwardly directed mainly neutral Ne atom current is 

formed by an ECR ion generator (2). A reaction gas such as silane gas which is 
supplied from a reaction gas inlet pipe (13) is sprayed onto an SiO
2
 substrate (11) 
by an action of the Ne atom current, so that an amorphous Si thin film is grown on 

the substrate (11) by a plasma CVD reaction. At the same time, a part of the Ne 
atom current having high directivity is directly incident upon the substrate (11), 

while another part thereof is incident upon the substrate (11) after its course is bent 
by a reflector (12). The reflector (12) is so set that all directions of the parts of the 

Ne atom current which are incident upon the substrate (11) are perpendicular to 
densest planes of single-crystalline Si. Therefore, the as-grown amorphous Si is 

sequentially converted to a single-crystalline Si thin film having crystal axes which 
are so regulated that the densest planes are oriented perpendicularly to the 

respective directions of incidence, by an action of the law of Bravais. Thus, a 
single-crystalline thin film is formed on a polycrystalline substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of and an apparatus for forming a
single-crystalline thin film on a substrate, i.e., an arbitrary medium, and it relates
to a method of and an apparatus for forming a single-crystalline thin film, which
implement selective and efficient formation of a single-crystalline thin film, and
it also relates to a beam irradiator, a beam irradiating method, and a beam reflecting
device for enabling efficient formation of a single-crystalline thin film or an axially
oriented polycrystalline thin film on a substrate.Plasma chemical vapor deposition (plasma CVD) is a sort of chemical vapor
deposition process (CVD), which is adapted to bring a reaction gas into a plasma
state for forming active radicals and ions and to cause a chemical reaction under
active environment, thereby forming a thin film of a prescribed material on a
substrate under a relatively low temperature. The plasma CVD, which can form
various types of films under low temperatures, has such advantages that it is
possible to form an amorphous film while preventing crystallization, to employ a
non-heat-resistant substrate such as a plastic substrate, and to prevent the as-formed
film from a reaction with the substrate. Therefore, the application range of
the plasma CVD is increasingly widened particularly in relation to semiconductor
industry.It is possible to epitaxially form a single-crystalline thin film of a prescribed 
material on a single-crystalline substrate by carrying out the plasma CVD under a
temperature facilitating crystallization.Generally, in order to form a single-crystalline thin film of a prescribed
material on a single-crystalline substrate of the same material having the same
crystal orientation, it is possible to employ an epitaxial growth process. In the
epitaxial growth process, however, it is impossible to form a single-crystalline thin
film on a polycrystalline substrate or an amorphous substrate. Therefore, in order
to form a single-crystalline thin film on a substrate having a different crystal
structure such as an amorphous substrate or a polycrystalline substrate, or a
substrate of a different material, an amorphous thin film or a polycrystalline thin
film is temporarily formed on the substrate so that the same is thereafter converted
to a single-crystalline thin film.In general, a polycrystalline or amorphous semiconductor thin film is single-crystallized
by fusion recrystallization or lateral solid phase epitaxy.However, such a process has the following problems: In the fusion
