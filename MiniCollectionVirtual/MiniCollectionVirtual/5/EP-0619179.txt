<ABSTRACT>
A welded steel pipe having good wear resistance, high corrosion 
resistance and low-temperature toughness is obtained by making a 

composite slab, consisting of an outer layer of high-carbon steel and an 
inner layer of steel with a relatively low carbon content, hot rolling 

the composite slab, forming the sheet into a round form, welding it to 
form a steel pipe, heating the pipe to a temperature between 800 and 

900°C., and quench the pipe so as to harden only the high-carbon outer 
layer. If necessary, this can be followed by reheating at a temperature 

between 200 and 600°C. 
The outer layer is a steel with 0.2 to 0.6% carbon and 0.1 to 3.0% 
manganese as basic components. The inner layer is a steel with 0.01 to 

0.3% carbon, 0.1 to 3.0% manganese as basic components, together with 
one or more of the following elements: 0.01 to 0.10% niobium, 0.01 to 

0.10% vanadium, 0.05 to 0.50% molybdenum and 0.005 to 0.10% titanium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to welded steel 
pipe steel and welded steel pipe having good inner surface 
wear resistance as required in such fields as oil and 
natural gas drilling and transportation, and to a method of 
manufacturing same. In recent years the requirements for the wear 
resistance properties of the inner surface of steel pipe 
have been increasing. In drilling for oil and natural gas 
a considerable amount of the related exploitation work 
involves horizontal drilling operations. A problem that 
arises during such operations is that of damage to the 
inner surface of casing pipe from wear caused by contact 
between the drill pipe and the casing pipe. There is also 
a demand for slurry pipe having an inner surface that is 
more wear resistant. Wear resistance can be effectively improved by 
increasing the hardness of the steel, as is disclosed by 
JP-A-62-270725. However, from the viewpoint of achieving  
 
both corrosion resistance and low-temperature toughness, 
hardening the whole of the steel pipe is undesirable. In 
recent years, thermal spraying of dissimilar metals and 
ceramics and the like, surface treatment processes and 
other such techniques for hardening just the surface region 
of steel pipe have been investigated but in each case have 
been found to lack sufficient productive efficiency. An object of the present invention is to provide 
steel for welded steel pipe having good inner-surface wear 
resistance properties. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide welded steel pipe that has an inner surface with 
good wear resistance properties. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide a method for efficiently manufacturing welded steel 
pipe having good inner-surface wear resistance properties. These objects are achieved by the invention. The 
invention will be described in detail in connection with 
Figure 1 which is a perspective view of a composite slab. The welded steel pipe steel having good wear 
resistance properties according to the present invention 
comprises an outer layer of high carbon, low alloy steel 
having good wear resistance properties comprising, by  
 
weight, 0.2 to 0.6 percent carbon and 0.1 to 3.0 percent 
manganese as basic components, and a low alloy inner layer 
comprising, by weight, 0.01 to 0.3 percent carbon and 0.1 
to 3.0 percent manganese as the basic components, and 
containing one, two or more selected from, by weight, 0.01 
to 0.10 percent niobium, 0.01 to 0.10 percent vanadium, 
0.05 to 0.50 percent
