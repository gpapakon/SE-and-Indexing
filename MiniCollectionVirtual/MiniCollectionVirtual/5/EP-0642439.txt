<ABSTRACT>
A rudder device for water-going craft or aircraft, where there is provided in the vessel a cavity (21) which is open to the outside of the vessel. In the cavity there is provided a body (2) which can rotate about an axis (3), which extends in the cavity (21) and out through the opening (22). The body (2) supports a rudder blade (7) which is fixed or movable in relation to the body (2) substantially in the direction of the axis of rotation (3) through the opening (22) and arranged to be secured by the body (2) after having been moved. The vessel is steered by turning the body (2) by means of the vessel's steering device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a rudder device of the type which is described in the 
introduction to claim 1. From US 4 016 824 there is known a rudder device of this type, where the cavity is 
provided in a conical shape and tapered towards the opening and arranged to receive 
a corresponding conical body. A slanting sleeve is running through the body and is 
attached thereto. A rudder which projects away from the vessel's hull when the body 
is mounted in the cavity, is attached to an end portion of a rotatable rudder stock 
which runs through the sleeve. This device has an arrangement for turning the body about its longitudinal axis in 
relation to the vessel's hull and a securing device for attaching the body in different 
angular positions and for canting the rudder blade in relation to the vessel's hull. The 
turning device, however, is not intended for steering the vessel, and a rudder blade is 
not arranged to be moved inwards in the hull with this device in order to reduce the 
vessel's draught. Since the rudder blade is mounted via a rudder stock, this is of vital importance with 
regard to the strength of the device, and since it may be necessary for the rudder 
stock to have a large diameter, this will also be the case for the rudder blade, and this 
may be undesirable. It is well nigh impossible to replace a rudder blade when the vessel is in the water or 
underway, either because the old one is damaged or when a rudder blade has to be 
installed with a different plane shape and/or profile.  
 The body can be turned in such a way that the rudder blade 
is tilted somewhat upward and backward. Even though this 
arrangement can thereby provide a slightly shallower 
draught when the rudder blade is canted than when it 
projects vertically downward, this is not the object of 
the device. The object of the invention is to provide a rudder device 
of the type described in the introduction which is not 
encumbered with the above-mentioned disadvantages. The characteristics of the rudder device according to the 
invention are characterized by the features in the claims 
presented. The invention will now be described in more detail with 
reference to the drawing which illustrates schematically 
embodiments of the invention. Fig. 1 is a longitudinal section through a portion of a 
vessel with a first embodiment of the rudder device 
according to the invention. Fig. 2 is a view of the rudder device illustrated in fig. 
1, viewed in the direction of arrow A. Fig. 3 is a section along line III-III through the

<CLAIMS>
A rudder device for water-going craft or aircraft, the 
craft being of a type in which there is provided in the 

vessel a cavity (21) which is open outward through the 
vessel's skin (10), the rudder device having a body 

(2,2'',2''',2'''') adapted for mounting in use in the cavity 
(21) of the said craft in such a manner that the body can 

rotate about an axis (3) which extends from the inner 
section of the cavity (21) and through its opening (22),
 
characterized in that the body receives the upper end of at 

least one rudder blade (7,7'',7''',7'''') and is of an extent 
which exceeds in every direction normal to the axis (3) 

that of the rudder blade(s) and is rotatable by means of a 
rudder manoeuvring device. 
A rudder device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that the opening (22) is so large and the rudder blade (7,7'',7''',7'''') is 

connected with the body (2,2'',2''',2'''') in such a manner that the rudder blade 
(7,7'',7''',7'''') is movable in relation to the body substantially in the direction of the axis 

of rotation (3) through the opening (22) and arranged to be secured by the body after 
such a movement. 
A rudder device according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that the rudder blade (7,7'',7''',7'''') is arranged to move in a slot 

(12,12'',12''',12'''') provided in the body (2,2'',2''',2'''').
