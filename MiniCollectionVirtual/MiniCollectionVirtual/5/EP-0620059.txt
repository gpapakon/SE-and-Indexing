<ABSTRACT>
The method is used to produce profile wire by profile-pressing of the starting wire, in particular for the production of all-steel fittings. In order in a particularly simple manner to avoid the curvature of the wire which occurs with the conventional method, production is accomplished by the following steps:   a) setting together and joining of at least two starting wires along areas extending essentially in the longitudinal direction of the wires, b) profile pressing of the joined starting wires while maintaining constant the ratios of the cross-sectional areas to one another perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the starting wires. At least two starting wires expediently consist of different materials.

Method of producing profile wire by profile 
pressing the starting wire, in particular for producing 

metallic card clothings, comprising the following steps: 

a) joining and connecting at least two starting wires 
along regions running essentially in the longitudinal 

direction of the wires 
b) profile pressing of the connected starting wires 
while keeping the ratios of the cross-sectional 

areas perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of 
the starting wires constant with respect to one 

another. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that at least two starting wires consist of materials 

which differ from one another. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one starting wire consists 

of unalloyed steel and at least one starting wire consists 
of alloyed steel. 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the unalloyed steel is C10 steel. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one starting wire is 

pressed into a profile before the joining operation. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the connecting is carried out by 

welding. 
Method according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the welding is carried out by high-vacuum electron 

beam welding, without the addition of fillers. 
Method according to one of Claims 6 or 7, characterized  
 

in that the starting wires are annealed after 
welding. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the profile pressing is carried out 

by profile rolling and/or profile drawing. 
Method according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the profile rolling and/or drawing is carried out in 

a combination of several cold- and/or hot-rolling and/or 
-drawing steps. 
Method according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the starting wires are annealed after each of the 

cold-rolling and/or cold-drawing steps. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that two starting wires are joined and 

connected. 
Method according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the two starting wires are flat wires rolled at 

right angles. 
Method according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the joined and connected starting wires are pressed 

into the form of a metallic card clothing with a root 
part and a blade part. 
Method according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that the root part consists of unalloyed steel and the 

blade part consists of alloyed steel. 
Method according to either of Claims 14 or 15, 
characte
rized in that teeth are stamped into the blade 
part after rolling and the teeth are hardened. 
Method according to Claim 16, characterized in 
that the hardened teeth are tempered.
