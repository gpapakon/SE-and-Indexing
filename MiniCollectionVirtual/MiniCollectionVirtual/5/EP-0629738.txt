<ABSTRACT>
Rotor for hydrodynamic cleaning under pressure of paper pulp originating from waste paper in cleaners of the known type comprising a cylindrical screen, characterized in that it comprises a body of cylindrical overall shape extending along a lengthwise axis 6 of rotation and which comprises along the lengthwise axis 6 a succession of n adjoining identical components 8, each component 8 being of cylindrical shape, the wall on the side of the screen having, here and there, a shoulder 14 whereof it describes a spiral winding around the lengthwise axis 6 over less than 360 DEG , the foot and the top of the shoulder forming a very small angular separating distance OMEGA  in relation to the said axis so that the face 14 of the shoulder is inclined towards the surface of the screen, the angle alpha  of this inclination in relation to the radial plane passing through the foot of the shoulder being between 5 DEG  and 80 DEG , the components 8 being offset in rotation about the axis 6 in relation to one another by an angle  beta , of a value of at least (360/n) DEG , n being equal to at least 3.
