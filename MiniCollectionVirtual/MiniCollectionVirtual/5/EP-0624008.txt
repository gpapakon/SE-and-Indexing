<ABSTRACT>
A communications satellite payload provides for efficient 
communications between user devices, such as hand held 

cellular telephones, and terrestrial gateways that may be 
connected to world-wide public telephone and telegraph 

(PTTs) networks. The satellite payload simultaneously 
supports a plurality of independent antenna beams, for 

example 12 or 16 beams, on both the uplink and downlink for 
user devices employing full duplex communications. The 

satellite payload furthermore supports an identical number 
of full duplex channels between a terrestrial gateway and 

the satellite. The communications satellite payload is 
carried by one satellite of a plurality of such satellites 

in a low earth orbit (LEO) constellation to provide world-wide 
communications. Downlink beam forming occurs prior to 

final amplification of transmitted signals, thereby 
reducing losses within the beam forming equipment. A multi-element 

phased array of receiving antennas and a multi-element 
phased array of transmitting antennas is also 

disclosed, wherein each element of each phased array is 
utilized for each individual one of a plurality of received 

or transmitted beams.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to communication systems
and, in particular, to communication apparatus carried by a
satellite platform.Important considerations when designing communication
equipment for space-based platforms include the weight,
complexity and power consumption of the equipment. A further
consideration relates to minimizing losses in signals
received from (uplink) and transmitted to (downlink) ground-based
stations. By example, for conventional- transmitters
that employ a phased array of antennas, significant losses
can occur within a beam forming system that is coupled
between the outputs of power amplifiers and the inputs to the
phased array of antennas.EP-A-0 516 039 discloses a satellite payload for use with a communication system, the
payload comprising:
a receiving antenna for receiving RF signals within a first band of
frequencies;ground station communication means having an input coupled to an output
of said antenna, for converting said received RF signals into RF signals within a second
band of frequencies and for transmitting RF signals to and for receiving RF signals from
a ground station, the transmitted and received RF signals being within said second
band of frequencies;second beam forming means having an input coupled to an output of said
ground station communication means for forming m downlink beams from the RF
signals received from said ground station, said m downlink beams being formed within
a third band of frequencies; anda transmitting antenna having an input coupled to an output of said ground
station communication means for transmitting said RF signals within a third band of
frequencies.Japanese Patent No. JP60033745 discloses a multi-beam
satellite communication system designed to allow flexibility
and traffic variation between beams. The system includes an
active phased array antenna used to produce a fixed multi-beam
in which power distribution to each beam is determined
in dependence on the required information capacity of each
beam. European Patent Application having publication No. EP-A-0,407,243
discloses an antenna array in which each
elementary antenna is associated with an active module
including reception and transmission amplifiers. An adaptive
processor is used in combination with beam forming calculator
modules to generate the output beams. With arrays of
typically 4000 to 5000 elements, several beams may be managed
simultaneously.It is thus an object of this invention to provide a satellite
communication payload of reduced complexity and
