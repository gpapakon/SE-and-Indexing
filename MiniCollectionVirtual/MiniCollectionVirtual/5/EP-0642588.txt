<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to methods of diagnosing fungal infections through the detection of distinct regions of the genome of pathogenic fungi. A first region of the genome is the 5S rRNA gene of such fungal organisms. This region is a conserved region for all pathogenic fungal organisms and its presence in a clinical sample is diagnostic of a fungal infection but not diagnostic of the species of fungi present. The second region of the genome is the non-transcribed spacer region of the rRNA repeat unit of such fungal organisms. This region is species-specific for each pathogenic fungal organism and its presence in a clinical sample is diagnostic of infection by that fungal organism. The methods of the invention provide for the detection of either or both genomic regions, as well as for the extraction of genomic DNA from fungal organisms. Also provided are nucleic acid probes and primers which bind to the distinct genomic regions, as well as diagnostic kits including such probes and/or primers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to methods of detecting the
presence or absence of human pathogenic yeasts and other pathogenic fungi
in a sample such as blood or human tissue. It further relates to nucleic
acid probes suitable for use in such methods as well as to diagnostic
kits incorporating such probes.There are almost 200 species in the diverse fungal genus of Candida,
eight of which infect humans, these being Candida albicans, Candida
tropicalis, Candida glabrata, Candida kefyr, Candida parapsilosis,
Candida krusei, Candida guilliermondii and Candida lusitaniae. These
species can become opportunistic human pathogens when host defences are
lowered and they are the most frequently observed fungal infections of
the immunocompromised.Candida species are usually commensal but also may cause a wide
spectrum of disease, from oral and vaginal mucosal thrush, to severe
mucocutaneous candidosis in AIDS patients, to invasive disseminated
infection in post-operative and immunocompromised patients. Further,
data from the United States National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance
system shows that the occurrence of life threatening invasive Candida
infection is increasing (Edwards J E, N Eng J Med324 1060-2 (1991).
Unfortunately, many patients die with undiagnosed invasive Candida
infections and one US study (Wey S B et al., Arch Intern Med 2642-1645
(1988)) has reported an attributable mortality rate to Candida of 26-49%.
This high attributable mortality rate is due to the considerable
susceptibility of certain at-risk groups, such as leukaemia patients.Treatment of invasive Candida infections is often delayed until the
causative organism is identified because the antifungal drugs used have
host toxicity, yet there is a much improved prognosis if antifungal
therapy is prompt. The focus of any treatment regime is therefore on the
specificity and rapidity of diagnosis of the infection.There is at present no single criterion for diagnosis of
disseminated candidosis. Diagnosis must be based on the clinical 
assessment of a number of indications, both from laboratory findings and
the patient's condition. Cumulative information currently used for
diagnosis includes fever with failure to respond to antibacterial agents.
presence of eye and skin lesions, positive blood cultures, recovery of
yeasts from biopsies and laboratory data from serological tests including
antigen detection. Furthermore, while tests for circulating antigen are
available, recent studies (Phillips P et al., J Clin Microbiol28 2320-6

A method of detecting the presence of a target fungal organism in
a sample comprising the step of testing said sample to detect the

presence or absence of part or all of a double-stranded DNA
molecule characteristic of and specific for said organism, said DNA

molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence containing a non-transcribed
spacer region of the rRNA repeat unit of said organism,

wherein detecting the presence or absence of said characteristic DNA molecule involves the
use of a nucleic acid probe capable of hybridising to a preselected region of

the rRNA repeat unit, wherein the target organism is

Candida albicans

a nucleotide sequence comprising part or all of the nucleotide

sequence from nucleotide 1 to nucleotide 936 of SEQ. ID No. 1 ; or
the nucleic acid probe

consists of a 0.9 kb 
Pst

repeat unit of 
C. albicans
 strain 10261 (ATCC 10261), a sub-fragment
thereof, or has a nucleotide sequence which hybridises at

high stringency thereto.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the testing step includes
the sub-steps of:


(a) amplifying any DNA present in said sample having a nucleotide
