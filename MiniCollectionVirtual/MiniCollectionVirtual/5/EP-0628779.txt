27, 31) for a first fluid, a jacket (1,17) surrounding 

said pipe bundle (5, 27, 31), closed at each end by end 
pieces (2, 23, 24) through which the pipes (5, 27, 31) 

extend, and with at least one entrance (3, 29, 33) and 
one exit (4, 30, 32) for a second fluid, with baffle 

walls (6, 39) between the entrance and exit, 
perpendicular to the pipes (5, 27, 31), for reversing the 

direction of flow of the second fluid, whereby said 
baffle walls leave a passage (10) for said second fluid 

alternately on one side and the other of the jacket (1, 
17), characterised in that the baffle walls (6, 39) are 

formed by at least one baffle plate (7, 28, 34) and at 
least one wall (8, 37, 38) extending over part of the 

inner circumference of the jacket (1, 17) and pointing 
inwards, to which is connected the outer edge of the 

baffle plate (7, 28, 34), so that where there is no wall 
(8, 37, 38), the passage (10) for the second fluid

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a heat exchanger comprising at least
one bundle of pipes for a first fluid, a jacket surrounding
said bundle of pipes, closed at each end by end pieces
through which the pipes extend, and with at least one
entrance and one exit for a second fluid, with baffle
walls between the entrance and exit, perpendicular to the
pipes, for reversing the direction of flow of the second
fluid, whereby said baffle walls leave a passage for said
second fluid alternately on one side and the other of the
jacket, whereby the baffle walls are formed by at least one
baffle plate and at least one wall extending over part of
the inner circumference of the jacket and pointing inwards,
to which is connected the outer edge of the baffle plate.A heat exchanger of this kind is knowm from US-A-3.830.289.
However in this heat exchanger, the small wall on the inner
side of the jacket extends without interruption over the
complete circumference of this jacket and the passage for
the second fluid is formed by the absence of part of the
baffle plate which has the form of a circle cut off at one
side. In such heat exchangers the flow of
the second fluid is partially perpendicular but partially
also parallel to the bundle, which limits the heat
transfer.Further, said known heat exchangers contain dead corners,
and furthermore dead spaces can form between the final
baffles and the end plates if the bundle is incorrectly
positioned, in which the second fluid is more or less
stationary, leading to accumulation of sediment and
locally high temperatures, resulting in lower heat
transfer as well as corrosion. Also in the case of said 
known heat exchangers, it is difficult for the baffles
next to the passage to be connected in a leakproof manner
to the jacket. Leaks between the jacket and the edge of
the baffle also reduce the cooling power.Said known heat exchangers are also difficult to adjust,
for example to obtain a higher speed of the second fluid.
They are calculated to work in an optimum manner at a
certain temperature and flow rate of the fluid. A large
reduction in the flow rate of the second fluid reduces
the heat exchanging capacity, due to the lower speed of
said second fluid, and due to a lower temperature
difference between the fluids. A heat exchanger of the type mentioned in the first
paragraph but comprising a rectangular jacket is also
disclosed in FR-A-1.218.287.In this heat exchanger, the baffles are formed by baffle
plates welded to two opposite lateral walls of the jacket.
The other lateral walls are

said bundle of pipes (5, 27, 31), closed at each end by end
pieces (2, 23, 24) through which the pipes (5, 27, 31)

said wall (8, 37, 38) extends in one of said channels (48)

closing it off while letting open the opposite channel

channel (48) alternately on one side and on the opposite
side of the jacket (1, 17), closing each time the opposite

channel (48), so that the passages (10) for the second
