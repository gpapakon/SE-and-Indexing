Method for packing a modular insulating upholstery for a closed 
chamber (7), constituted of panels (1,2) designed to cover the peripheral 

walls, the ceiling and the floor of said chamber, and of prefabricated 
elements comprising spacers (5, 6) placed between the internal surface of 

the chamber (7) and the external surfaces of said panels (1), and 
produced in a material capable of breaking any thermal conduction 

between said two surfaces, characterised in that: 

panels (1) made from a monobloc insulating material are pre-cut 
in a factory according to identical and standard dimensions, with the 

lengths of some panels being determined to be less than the height of the 
chamber (7) so as to constitute the lateral panels (1) and the lengths of 

other panels corresponding to the width of the chamber so as to constitute 
the ceiling panels and said panels being self-supporting whatever their 

position ; 
said spacer elements (6) are prefabricated in a factory for 
lateral panels (1) in the form of small blocks and in a number at least 

equal to three times the number of said panels (1), as well as the spacers 
(5) for ceiling panels constituted of flexible blocks which compensate for 

the variations in dimensions; 
other insulating panels (2) are pre-cut in a factory according to 
identical and standard dimensions, with the lengths of said panels being 

less than the height of the chamber (7) decreased in thickness of two self-supporting 
lateral panels (1), so as to constitute the floor panels; 
a sufficient number of said panels (1, 2) and said spacers (5, 
6) are packed with flat joint covers (3) and corner joint covers (4) in 

packages forming an assembly set or kit and it is delivered onto any site 
where all of these elements may be assembled directly inside the 

chamber (7) without requiring a qualified staff or any tooling. 
Assembly set of a modular insulating upholstery, packed 
according to the method of claim 1, characterised in that it comprises all 

the elements necessary for said upholstering, among which said insulating 
panels (1, 2), said flat joint covers (3) and corner joint covers (4) and said 

spacers (5, 6), all of said panels (1, 2) being of the same length. 
Assembly set of an upholstery according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the plates constituting the panels (1, 2) are covered  

 
over at least one of their faces with a material producing a reflecting 

surface. 
Assembly set of an upholstery according to claim 3, 
characterised in that said plates are symmetrical and reversible with 

double reflecting faces. 
Assembly set of an upholstery according to any one of claims 2 
to 4, characterised in that it comprises spacers (5) constituted of flexible 

blocks which compensate for the variations in dimensions. 
Assembly set of an upholstery according to any one of claims 2 
to 5, characterised in that it comprises a sheet (10) of supple and tight 

material. 
Assembly set of an upholstery according to any one of claims 2 
to 5, characterised in that said spacers (6) are twin-face self-adhesive 

patches in supple material. 
Assembly set of an upholstery according to any one of claims 2 
to 7, characterised in that said insulating panels (1) are formed of a core 

(8) constituted of a plate of several centimetres thickness in a semi-rigid 
alveolated material, of expanded polystyrene or honeycomb cardboard 

type. 
Method for producing a modular insulating upholstery for a 
closed chamber (7), from an assembly set according to any one of claims 

2 to 8, characterised in that: 

the spacers (6) are fixed on the lateral walls of the chamber 
(7) to be equipped, in a number at least equal to 3 for each panel (1); 
said insulating lateral panels (1) covering the lateral peripheral 
walls are applied against said spacers (6); 
then the ceiling panels of which the length is equal to the 
width of the chamber, are slid above said lateral panels so that said ceiling 

panels can be placed astride on the upper ends of said lateral panels; 
then said ceiling panels (1) are stabilized by flexible spacers 
(6) interposed between said panels and the ceiling of the chamber; 
then a supple insulating sheet (10) and the insulating floor 
panels (2) are laid without any fixing means and said upholstery is 

completed by flat joint covers (3) and corner joint covers (4) composing 
the insulating assembly set and enabling said insulation to be completed. 
Modular insulating upholstery, characterised in that it is made 
from an assembly set according to any one of claims 2 to 8, and according 

to the method of claim 9.
