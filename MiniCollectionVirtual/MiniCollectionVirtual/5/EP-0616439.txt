<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for simultaneously detecting
a plurality of discrete laser modulation frequencies and, in particular relates to one such
apparatus having a detector circuit with means for canceling background radiation.A prior art portable laser detection device for detecting short
duration energy pulses is known from US-A-5142142.In modern warfare many weapons rely on laser beams to acquire and track targets.
The use of lasers in this fashion has numerous advantages among which is the difficulty
of the target to detect the fact that it has been targeted. Hence, there is considerable time
and expense being dedicated to laser detection. It is known that, because of the nature of
lasers, laser targeting systems either operate at only a limited number of frequencies or,
due to the modulation techniques conventionally employed, the frequencies are difficult to
change once a weapon is in production.At the present time, laser detection systems require expensive passive and analog
circuitry, as well as digital signal processing equipment. The main disadvantage of
conventional systems is the expense of obtaining high performance in the presence of
background light radiation. For example, since most lasers operate at visible light
frequencies, the detection of the presence of a laser in daylight is difficult due to the
presence of sunlight. Sunlight causes a very strong background against which to
discriminate a laser. To accomplish such discrimination with a sufficient signal to noise
ratio to be useful, expensive optical components and circuitry and techniques, such as
those cited above, are required.Consequently, it is highly desirable to provide a circuit that overcomes the
difficulties of laser light discrimination from background radiation using relatively
inexpensive circuit components and techniques. Accordingly, it is an aim of the present invention to provide an apparatus
for detecting a plurality of discrete laser modulation frequencies that
substantially completely overcomes the above recited drawbacks of the prior art.This aim is accomplished, at least in part, by an apparatus as claimed
in claim 1 hereinafter.Other aims and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art from
the following detailed description of the invention read in conjunction with the appended
claims and the drawings attached hereto.The drawing, not drawn to scale, includes:
