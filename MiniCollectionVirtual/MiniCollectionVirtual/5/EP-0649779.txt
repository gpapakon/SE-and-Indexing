<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a belt tensioner for safety-belt restraint systems in vehicles, the belt reel (16) of the belt retractor is made to rotate by a linear drive unit via a gear mechanism which can be stepped up in speed. The linear drive unit contains a rupture-proof cylinder tube (42), which is closed at both ends, and a hollow piston (44) which can be displaced therein and in the interior of which there is accommodated a pyrotechnic propellant charge (50) with igniter (52). The belt tensioner is distinguished by a compact construction, low weight and cost-effective production and by reliable handling of the linear drive unit.

A belt tensioner for vehicular seat belt restraining
systems comprising a pyrotechnical piston/cylinder linear drive

unit, the piston (44) of which drives a tooth rack (46), and a
step-up gear (22, 24, 26) which is connected at its output end

to the belt reel (16) of a belt retractor and having at its
input end a pinion (22) which meshes with the tooth rack, the

tooth rack (46) being formed along the envelope of the piston
(44) and a pyrotechnical propelling charge (50) being

accommodated in said piston which is hollow, characterized in
that said piston (44) is accommodated in a cylinder tube (42)

which is inserted in a bore (40) of a gear housing (20) applied
to the side of the belt retractor and which has a cutout (48)

in its envelope for the penetration of the pinion (22).
The belt tensioner as set forth in claim 1, characterized
in that said cylinder tube (42) is provided at one of its axial

ends (42b) with a burstproof stop for the piston (44) and at
its other end (42a) with a plug (55) comprising an axial

passage (55a) and a burst disk (55b) closing the latter.
The belt tensioner according to claim 1, characterized in
that a pyrotechnical propellant cartridge (70) is inserted into

the interior of the piston (44) formed hollow, said propellant
cartridge comprising two sleeve portions (70a, 70b) joined

together by a rated breaking groove (72), one of said sleeve
portions (70a) forming a bottom with an axial passage (70c)

closed by a burst disk (70d) and the other one (70b) comprising
a sealing lip (74) sealingly engaging the wall of the cylinder

tube (42). 
The belt tensioner as set forth in claim 2 or 3,
characterized in that said linear drive unit comprising said

cylinder tube (42), piston (44), propelling charge (50) and
igniter (52) forms a preassembled unit.
The belt tensioner as set forth in claim 4, characterized
in that said igniter (52) is formed as a percussion igniter

having an impact pin (52a) protruding from an opening on an
axial end of said piston.
The belt tensioner as set forth in any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said gear comprises a first

gearwheel (24) with which said pinion (22) is coupled for joint
rotation and a second gearwheel (26) meshing with said first

gearwheel (24), said second gearwheel (26) being rigidly
connected to a coupling ring (28), in that said coupling ring

(28) surrounds a lateral drive projection (30) of the belt reel
(16) and that between said drive projection (30) and said

coupling ring (28) a plurality of coupling rolls (32) is
arranged.
