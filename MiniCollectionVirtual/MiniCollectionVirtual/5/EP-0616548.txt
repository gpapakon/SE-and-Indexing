<ABSTRACT>
In a pack of playing cards for an educational game, each card carries at least one question (9) with its answer (10) and the depiction of a die-face (3). The cards may be used to replace the throwing of a die in a die-an-track game such as Ludo, the player being required to answer correctly the question, which is put to him by another person, before being permitted to move his identifying piece along the track by the number on the depicted die-face. Each card may carry a plurality of "easy" and "hard" questions whose difficulty may be indicated by accompanying symbols such as circles, squares or diamonds. Packs may be provided with cards suitable for two-die games such as Monopoly (Trade Mark), and for simulating other games such as snooker. The cards of any one pack may relate to a single educational discipline such as "Spelling", and companion packs for other disciplines such as "Arithmetic", French, etc., may be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pack of playing cards for an educational 
game. The game may be of especial interest for children, although it 
may also be played by adults. The need for encouraging children to learn is well-known, and to this 
end a number of games have been devised over the years. Many such games 
involve the use of cards which carry questions for the child to answer. 
Particularly well-known are are so-called flash card games in which the 
front face of a card carries a question for the child to answer. Such 
questions may be in the form of a straightforward question, an 
arithmetical problem such as 4 + 7 = ? , or a picture of of an object 
which the child has to spell. Other card games are known in which the 
front face of the card bears both the question and the answer. With 
such games the question is read to the child by another person, the card 
face only being shown to the child after he has answered.  
 Unfortunately in such games the 'educational' content is very high and 
the 'game' content is low, with the result that the child becomes bored 
and loses interest. The need therefore is for the 'game' content to be 
increased so that the child is keen to continue, and it is to this end 
that the present invention is directed. Most children are familiar with so-called "die-and-track" games. In 
such games a board is provided on which is printed a track of sequential 
rectangles leading from a "start" position to an "end" position. Each 
player in the game has an identifying piece, such as a coloured disc, 
which can be placed in a rectangle on the track. The player throws a die 
and his identifying piece is moved along the track by the number of 
rectangles equal to that shown on the upper face of the die. "Ludo" and 
"Snakes and Ladders" are well-known examples of such a game. Such die-and-track 
games are both very familiar and very popular. The present 
invention provides an arrangement whereby for such a game the die is 
replaced by cards bearing the depiction of a die face, and a player is 
required to answer a question on the card before he can advance his 
piece. According to the invention a pack of playing cards for an educational 
game comprises a plurality of cards, each card having a front and rear 
face, each card having disposed on the front face thereof at least one 
question, and each card having disposed thereon the answer to the or 
each question, and each card having disposed thereon a depiction of a 
die-face. The pack of cards may comprise a plurality of sets of
