<DESCRIPTION>
DNA ENCODING 5-HT, SEROTONIN RECEPTORS AND DSES THEREOFBackground of the InventionThroughout this application various publications are referred to by partial citations within parenthesis. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications, in their entireties, are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.Molecular cloning efforts have provided primary amino acid sequence and signal transduction data for a large collection of serotonin receptor subtypes. These include five cloned 5-HT_,-li e receptors, three cloned 5-HT2 receptors, and one 5-HT- receptor. The 5-HT, subfamily includes: 5~HTιA (Fargin, 1988; Kobilka, 1989), 5-HT1B/5-HT1M (Weinshank et al. , 1991; Demchyshyn et al., 1992; Jin et al., 1992; Adham et al., 1992; Maroteaux et al., 1992; Voight et al., 1991), 5-HT1Dβ (Branchek et al. 1991; Hamblin and Metcalf, 1991; Weinshank et al., 1992), 5-HT1E (Levy et al., 1992; McAllister et al., 1992; Zgombick et al., 1992) and 5- HT1F (Adham et al., 1993). All five have been shown to couple to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The 5-HT2 family includes the 5-HT2 receptor (Pritchett et al., 1988), 5-HT1c (Julius et al., 1989) and 5-HT2F (Rat Stomach Fundus; Foquet et al., 1992; Kursar et al., 1992). These receptors all couple to phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The 5-HT3 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel (Maricq et al., 1991).Although this work represents enormous success, the absence of molecular biological information on the 5- 

HT4 receptors, which have been shown in native tissues to couple to the activation of adenylate cyclase as a primary mode of signal transduction (Du ius et al., 1988; Bockaert et al., 1990), is apparent. In a previous copending application (U.S. Serial No., 971,690, filed November 3, 1992), we reported the cloning of the first mammalian 5-HT receptor that couples to the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity which we named 5-HT4B. The 5-HT4B receptor was subsequently renamed to the "5-HT- receptor" by the "Serotonin Receptor Nomenclature Committee" of the IUPHAR. The pharmacological properties of this receptor indicated that it was similar to a series of functionally defined 5-HT receptors described in the porcine vena cava (Trevethick et al., 1984), cat saphenous vein, coronary arteries (Cushing and Cohen, 1992) , and several vascular dilatory effects
