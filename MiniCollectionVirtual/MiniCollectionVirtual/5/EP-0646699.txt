<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to provide a method and an apparatus for adapting the radial turbines of turbochargers to the respective internal combustion engine. The method and apparatus are to involve a relatively low expenditure of material and work time and low costs. According to the invention, this is achieved by virtue of the fact that only those components in the radial turbine (1) which are on the gas exit side are modified. For this purpose, the blades (5) of the rotor (6) are first of all shortened, and the corresponding tapering of the flow duct (7) between the hub (8) of the rotor (6) and the gas exit flange (9) is then carried out. This is performed by the use of another, correspondingly enlarged gas exit flange (9). For this purpose, the gas exit flange (9) is fastened in an easily detachable manner to the gas inlet housing (2).

Method for matching the radial turbine of a
turbocharger to an internal combustion engine,

the radial turbine (1)

a) being formed at the gas inlet end by a gas inlet
casing (2) spatially terminated by a nozzle ring (3)

and at the gas outlet end by a rotor (6) having a
hub (8) and a plurality of vanes (5), and a gas

outlet flange (9) connected releasably to the gas
inlet casing (2), and having a flow duct (7) formed

between the hub (8) and the gas outlet flange (9),
b) being matched to the internal combustion engine by
modifying or exchanging various components in accordance

with the connection conditions of the said
engine and, as this is being done, only those components

of the radial turbine (1) which are at the gas
outlet end being modified.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the vanes (5) of the rotor (6) are first shortened

and the flow duct (7) between the hub (8) of the rotor
(6) and the gas outlet flange (9) is then correspondingly

narrowed.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that a smaller rotor (6) is first inserted and the flow

duct (7) between the hub (8) of the rotor (6) and the gas
outlet flange (9) is then correspondingly narrowed.
Method according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the existing gas outlet flange (9) is replaced by

a different, correspondingly shaped, i.e. enlarged gas
outlet flange (9) in order to narrow the flow duct (7).
