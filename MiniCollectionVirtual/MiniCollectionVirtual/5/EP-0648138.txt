<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a double-barrelled tube with a respiratory (11) and an inhaling (12) passage for the mechanically controllable respiration of a patient in which the inhaling passage connected to a respiratory gas source is fitted at the distal outlet with a nozzle directed towards the distal outlet aperture of the respiratory passage. The respiratory passage is connected at the proximal outlet with an exhalation valve (60) which can be opened and closed by means of an electrical control device. The electrical control device is connected to an electrocardiograph or a blood pressure measuring instrument so that respiration may be effected synchronously with the pulse rate using the respiratory gas fed to the inhalation passage with a retrograde flow of respiratory gas. Inhalation may take place in either the systole or the diastole.
