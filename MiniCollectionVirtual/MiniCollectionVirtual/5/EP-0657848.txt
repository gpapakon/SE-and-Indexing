<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a character generating apparatus and 
a method of the same. The character generating 

apparatus comprises a storage means for storing 
character data that consist of coordinate data, a 

generation means for generating a character pattern 
according to the coordinate data stored in the storage 

means, a determination means for determining a 
parameter to make the character pattern thick or thin, 

and a conversion means for converting the coordinate 
data according to the parameter determined by the 

determination means; and employing the generation means 
to generate a thick or thin character pattern according 

to coordinate data converted by the conversion means. 
The character generating method, which employs 
this apparatus, requires only a small memory capacity 

to generate character data for font styles with various 
weights.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a character
generating apparatus that converts characters, etc.,
that have been coded in vector form into characters
that are coded in dot form, and to a method that is
employed for effecting the described conversion.In a conventional apparatus that develops data
that are stored in vector form into a bit map and
outputs characters, coordinate data that are stored in
a ROM, or on a hard disk, are read out and converted
into a desired size by multiplying them by a rate of
enlargement or reduction. The resultant data are then
converted into dot form data to provide character data.In this case, however, if there are different
weights for an identical font style, there must be one
set of coordinate data for each weight. For a Japanese
font style, where there are about 8000 characters per
font style and where the memory capacity for the
coordinate data required for each font must be 1M byte
to 3M bytes, if coordinate data were provided for each
weight, the memory capacity would be enormous. To overcome the above shortcoming, it is an object
of the present invention to generate different weight
data for an identical font style from character data,
which consist of a plurality of outline data for at least
one font style, so that various weight character data for
individual font styles can be produced with a small
memory capacity.EP-A-0385269 discloses a character generating
apparatus including means for converting the outline of
a character to an outline having a different thickness.
The inside of the character outline is filled in.EP-A-0549256 discloses a character processing
apparatus in which the widths of the character may be
increased or decreased. The outline of the character is
converted into a Bezier curve in order to enable the
character to be thickened or thinned.EP-A-0454125 discloses a character generating
apparatus in which the desired typeface can be produced
automatically by manipulation of the coordinate data of
control points within the character.Patent Abstracts of Japan, vol. 16, no. 323 (P-1386)
and JP-A-04093992 discloses a character processing
apparatus in which a control point within a character is
moved in order to cause thickening or thinning of the
width of the character.The features of the present invention will now be
explained.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a character generating
apparatus comprising input means for receiving a
parameter for designating an amount by which a character
is to be thickened or

<CLAIMS>
A character generating apparatus comprising:

input means (4, 5) for receiving a parameter for
designating an amount by which a character is to be

thickened or narrowed; and
processing means (1, 2) for processing coordinate
data representing an outline of a character to be

thickened or narrowed so as to thicken or narrow said
character in accordance with the parameter received by

said input means;
the apparatus being characterised in further

adjustment means for adjusting coordinate data
processed by said processing means, such that the frame

size of said character is the same after adjustment as
before processing of the coordinate data; and
generating means (1, 2) for generating a character
pattern corresponding to the coordinate data adjusted by

said adjustment means.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 1, wherein said
processing means (1, 2) is operable to process the

coordinate data such that the coordinates of point B on
an outline of the character to be thickened or narrowed

are shifted in the processing of said coordinate data in
a direction which bisects the angle defined between 

vectors AB and BC wherein points A and C are respectively
preceding and succeeding points on the outline to point

B.
Apparatus in accordance with either of the preceding
claims, wherein a parameter received by said input means

(4, 5) is operable to designate an amount by which the
character is to be thickened or narrowed in X and Y

directions, and said processing means (1, 2) is operable
to process the coordinate data so as to adjust the

coordinate data in the X and Y directions.
