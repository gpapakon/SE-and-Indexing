<ABSTRACT>
A gas supply system cquipped with cylinders. in which the 
fear of a dangerous feed gas flowing backward to a purge gas 

introduction line and the likes can be prevented, is provided.
 

[Construction] 
A piping portion B1 which becomes a negative pressure area is 
demarcatedly formed in a purge gas introduction line B by arranging two 

valves V3 and V7 in series therein, and in the piping portion B1 
demarcatedly formed by these two valves V3 and V7, a gas in the piping 

portion B1 is led to a vent line D through a vent line D2 having a third 
valve V8 provided therein, and a pressure sensor 12 is placed for 

detecting the gas pressure in the piping portion B1. If any trouble 
takes place in the valve V3 or valve V8, a raise in pressure will be 

generated in the piping portion B1 in which the inner volume thereof is 
made small. By detecting this raise in pressure by the pressure 

sensor 12, the fear of a feed gas flowing backward to the purge gas 
introduction line B can be quickly detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas supply system equipped
with cylinders for supplying a feed gas necessary for manufacture of
semiconductors from a cylinder to a semiconductor manufacturing unit.In the manufacture of semiconductors, a feed gas necessary
therefor is supplied from a cylinder 1 to a semiconductor manufacturing
unit 2 (a dangerous gas having toxicity or combustibility such as silane
or phosphine is often used as the feed gas). For making provision
against an emergency of gas leakage, as shown in Fig. 6, the said
cylinder 1 is usually accomodated in a gas supply apparatus in which
air in the inside thereof is ventilated at all times, this is called
a cylinder cabinet 3. The said cylinder cabinet 3 is constructed, as shown in the
same figure, in the form of a vertically long box having an exhaust
damper 4 provided on its ceiling, wherein a door (not shown) for putting
the cylinder 1 therein or therefrom is hinged for movement between the
open position and the close position on the opened front thereof. For
making provision against an emergency of gas leakage, the cylinder
cabinet 3 has a gas leakage detection and warning device (not shown)
attached in the inside thereof for quickly detecting a gas leakage.
In the inside of the cylinder cabinet 3 is arraned a gas supply line A
composed of a metallic pipe (this is usually a small pipe made of
stainless steel) passed through the pressure resistance and gas-tightness
test, as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. And also in the inside
of the cylinder cabinet 3 are respectively arranged, other than this gas
supply line A, a purge gas introduction line B, a gas-tightness checking
gas introduction line C and a vent line D, each composed of a metallic
pipe passed through the same pressure resistance and gas-tightness test,
in a condition that they are associated with one another.The said gas supply line A functions to lead a feed gas
flowing out of the cylinder 1 to the semiconductor manufacturing unit 2. 
as the main valve 5 of the cylinder 1 is opened. The uppermost stream
portion A1 of this gas supply line A is wound in the form of a coil so
as to absorb the difference in height of the mouthpieces of respective
cylinders 1 which are somewhat different, and connected to the cylinder
mouthpiece portion 6 thereof. After the feed gas is passed from the
cylinder 1 through the uppermost stream portion A1, thus, it is led to
a reducing valve V2 by way of a sluice valve (hereinafter called a high-pressure
isolation valve) V1 which is usually positioned
