<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel polymer blends.Impact modified styrene polymers are well known in the plastics industry.
Dispersion of particulate rubber tougheners throughout the resin matrix, enhance
the impact strength of the styrene polymers. Typically, improvements in impact
strength are obtained by incorporating ever increasing amounts of particulate
rubber toughening agents. However, the resulting increases in impact strength is
accompanied by a decrease in both tensile strength and surface gloss.The polymer blends of the current invention provide materials with
improved impact strength and surface gloss while maintaining reasonable tensile
strength.It is known in the art that some physical properties of styrenic or acrylic
type polymers may be improved by alloying them with one or more additional
polymers. In some cases, the resulting mixture can have improved mechanical
properties, such as improved impact strength or toughness.Chemical Abstracts 109:171278v [Polym. Prepr. (Am. Chem. Soc., Div.
Polym. Chem.) 1988, 29(2), 180-1] discloses that physical blends of block SBR
(styrene content: 75.2 weight %) and a copolymer of methyl methacrylate and
styrene are partially compatible. The morphological and mechanical properties
of the blend are strongly dependent on the molding/mixing process used to 
produce the blend. The SBR could only be toughened when the ideal
morphology of the blend was obtained.Chemical Abstracts 106:85901z [JP 61/200,151] discloses thermoplastic
compositions comprising from 5 to 95 weight % of a block copolymer and from
95 to 5 weight % of a thermoplastic polymer (e.g. ABS). The block copolymer
is derived from coupling an aromatic vinyl polymer block with an aromatic vinyl
monomer-conjugated diene copolymer block. The subject thermoplastic
compositions apparently have improved impact strength.Chemical Abstracts 112:8285y [JP 61/291,610] discloses the use of
"impact modifiers" for thermoplastic polymers. The modifiers are basically
similar to the block copolymer disclosed by Chemical Abstracts 106:85901z.Chemical Abstracts 99:196070j [JP 58/122,954] discloses improvement of
anisotropy of a styrene hydrocarbon-conjugated diene block copolymer by
blending it with a styrene-methacrylic ester copolymer. Such a blend, when
extruded to form a molded plate, apparently possesses superior physical
properties.Chemical Abstracts 111:8522c [JP 01/45614] discloses high-impact
styrene polymer compositions comprises a major amount of a styrene (50 to 90
weight %)-conjugated diene (50
