Ti, Zr, Cr, Ni, Y and rare earth elements; and an Al₂O₃ 
powder as a base material; or further containing 0.5-40 

wt% of one kind or more of compounds composed of one 
kind or more of transient elements in the groups IVa, 

Va, and VIa of the periodic table and one kind or more

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an Al2O3 (alumina)
based ceramic material and a method of manufacturing the
same. In particular, the present invention concerns an
Al2O3 based ceramic material suitable for tools
requiring high strength, toughness and wear resistance,
such as cutting tools and a die extrusion plug, and
mechanical parts requiring wear resistance, toughness
and shock resistance, such as a pump valve and a
mechanical seal; and a method of manufacturing the same.An Al2O3 based ceramic material, having a high
strength and being excellent in corrosion resistance,
oxidization resistance and wear resistance, has been
known to be suitable for mechanical parts and
jigs/tools. However, it is inferior in strength and
toughness to a Si3N4 based ceramic material which has
been extensively used as an engineering ceramic
material. Various attempts have been made to improve the
strength and toughness of an Al2O3 based ceramic
material. One is to add SiC whiskers to an Al2O3 based
ceramic material, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,543,345. This method is successful to obtain the
excellent toughness, however, it presents a problem in
the manufacturing process. Namely, in this method, an
Al2O3 based ceramic material added with SiC whiskers
(hereinafter, referred to as "SiC whiskers containing
Al2O3 based ceramic material") is manufactured by hot-pressing,
and is difficult to be formed into a complex
shape or into a large size.JP1103267 discloses a ceramic composite material
obtained by evenly dispersing a SiC whisker in an amount
of 5-50 vol% into an alumina matrix (50-95%). The
alumina matrix may contain at least one of TiB2 and ZrB2
in an amount of 10-50 vol%. The ceramic composite
material may also comprise a small amount (0.5 wt%) of
MgO. A slurry is prepared which is then subjected to a
granulating process to produce alumina - SiC whisker
composite granules. The granules are then pressed and
sintered at 1800°C under a high pressure to obtain the
composite ceramic body.WO91/08994 discloses a fibre-reinforced ceramic
composite body based on Al2O3 which is made by a combined
sintering and a hot-isostatic pressuring process
performed in one heating stage without intermediate
cooling. The mechanical properties are improved by the
addition of 0.05 to 2% mass of one or more noble metals. To solve this problem, a pressureless-sintering
process has been attempted for a SiC whiskers containing
Al2O3 based ceramic material. For example, Terry N.
Tigers et al, disclose a method in J. Am. Ceram.
