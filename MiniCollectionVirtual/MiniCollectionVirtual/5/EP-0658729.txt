Ventilation system intended for the rooms of buildings and with ventilation
appliances arranged in the window ledge regions in which at least one respective

ventilation appliance (16, 16', 16'') constructed as a modular insert is exchangeably
received in each of at least two housing receptacle chambers (15, 15', 15'', 115) arranged

to lie one beside the other below at least one window (12, 212) and each housing
receptacle chamber (15, 15', 15'', 115) is provided with openings (20, 22, 20', 22', 20'', 22'')

for the air inlet and openings (21, 23, 123) for the air outlet, which openings are in
dependence on the kind of the respectively used modular insert selectively left open or

closed by the latter.
Ventilation system according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that a heat
exchanger (18, 118, 218), which is switchable over for the throughflow of cooling medium,

is arranged below at least one receptacle chamber (15, 15', 15'', 115) of the housing (11,
111, 112) extending along below the window (11, 111, 211) and an air-circulating device

for the circulation of room air and with an air outlet (22) directed substantially towards the
heat exchanger (18, 118, 218) is received in the receptacle chamber lying thereover.
Ventilation system according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that in the case
of rooms with windows lying one beside the other in a hole facade, a respective housing

with at least one receptacle chamber for a ventilation appliance is arranged below each of
at least two windows.
Ventilation system according to one of the claims 1 and 2, characterised thereby,
that a housing (11) with at least two receptacle chambers (15, 15', 15'', 115), which lie one

beside the other each for at least one respective ventilation appliance, extends
continuously over at least a substantial part of the respective room width.
Ventilation system according to claim 4, characterised thereby, that in the case of
continuous window lines (12), the housing with the receptacle chambers (15, 15', 15'',

115), which are arranged one beside the other each for at least one respective ventilation
appliance, extends substantially over the entire width of the window line. 
Ventilation system according to claim 4 or 5, characterised thereby, that in the case
of housings (11) with at least two receptacle chambers (15, 15' 15'', 115), which are

arranged to lie one beside the other, for at least one respective ventilation appliance the
chambers are constructed to be sound-insulated each from the other.
Ventilation system according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterised thereby, that
each receptacle chamber (15, 15', 15'', 115) has at least two openings (20, 21, 20', 21',

20'', 21''), which face outwards and are spaced one from the other, as well as at least two
openings, (22, 23, 123), which are arranged towards the interior space.
Ventilation system according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby, that in
the case of a receptacle chamber (15, 115), which is equipped with an air-circulating

device (16), its outwardly facing openings (20, 21) are closed by the air-circulating device
(16), whilst the openings (22, 23, 123), which are arranged towards the interior space,

couple to the air guide of the ventilating device.
Ventilation system according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby, that in
the case of a receptacle chamber (15', 115), which is equipped with a ventilating device

(16) having each of an air feed and an air discharge function (28, 29), its inwardly and its
outwardly facing openings (20', 21', 22', 23', 123) couple to the air guide of the ventilating

device (16).
Ventilation system according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised thereby, that
housing receptacle chambers (15''), which are not needed for the installation of ventilating

devices, are each equipped with a respective insulating material insert (25) constructed as
a modular insert and the openings, which are provided for air circulation, of the respective

receptacle chamber are closed by these.
Ventilation system according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised thereby, that
each receptacle chamber (15, 15', 15'') of the housing (11, 111, 211) comprises at least

one removable attachment (17, 17', 17''; 117) for the closing of an insertion opening.
Ventilation system according to claim 11, characterised thereby, that the removable
attachment (17, 17', 17''; 117) is constructed as housing wall on the inside of the room. 
Ventilation system according to claim 12, characterised thereby, that the removable
attachment (17, 17', 17''; 117) displays the air outlet (22, 22', 22'') facing the heat

exchanger (18, 118, 218).
Ventilation system according to one of the claims 1 to 13, characterised thereby,
that the housing receptacle chambers (115) in vertical aspect display excess dimension

relative to the ventilating devices and, in the case of ventilating devices having been
installed, an air guide channel (119) extends between these and the upper termination of

the respective receptacle chamber, which channel is provided in the corner region towards
the window with an 
entry opening (123) for room air.
