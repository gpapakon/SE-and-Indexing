<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an hsr (hypersensitivity-related) gene family and individual 
components thereof including its promoter and regulatory regions thereof, its coding region, its 
gene product; modifications thereto; applications of said gene, promoter region, regulatory 
region and coding region and modifications thereto; DNA constructs, vectors and transformed 
plants each comprising the gene or part thereof. The hypersensitive reaction (HR) of higher plants is a local inducible response associated with 
disease resistance to a pathogen. This response is characterized by a rapid and localized 
necrosis of tissues invaded by an incompatible (avirulent or non-host) pathogen, which prevents 
further spread of the invading microorganism. Several defense genes whose products may 
intervene in this plant response have been extensively studied: they include enzymes of the 
phenylpropanoid pathway involved in the synthesis of antimicrobial phytoalexins, enzymes with 
hydrolytic activities, toxic compounds and cell wall proteins. In infected plants, these genes are 
induced around the necrosis, once it has developed, i.e. late during the HR. Moreover, most of 
them are also strongly expressed during compatible interactions leading to the disease of the 
plant, and for some of them, during the normal development of the plant. The lack of 
specificity of these defense genes as well as their activation in the late steps of the HR suggest 
that they may not account by itself for establishment of the complex inducible response that 
is the HR, but rather may accompany this reaction. To date, the molecular mechanisms leading 
from plant-pathogen recognition to development of the HR are not known. In the "gene for 
gene" hypothesis, the initial step of plant-pathogen recognition leading to resistance involves 
the putative interaction between the products of a plant resistance gene and of the 
corresponding pathogen avirulent gene. Genetic studies indeed revealed that the outcome of 
many plant-pathogen interactions are determined through single dominant genes in both 
partners. Several rapid physiological changes have been also associated with the HR, such as 
electrolyte leakage, changes in respiration rates and more recently oxidative cross-linking of 
cell-wall proteins. However, in no case has a plant gene been described whose activation is 
specific or at least preferential during the resistance reaction, and precedes the development of 
the HR. It is known that Pseudomonas solanacearum, a vascular
