<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to fuel injectors of the type that are 
used to inject liquid fuel into the air induction system of an internal 
combustion engine and particularly to an atomizer that fits over the nozzle 
of such a fuel injector and serves to convey assist air to promote the 
atomization of the injected liquid fuel that has just left the nozzle. Air assist atomization of the liquid fuel injected from the nozzle of a 
fuel injector is a known technique that is used to promote better 
preparation of the combustible air/fuel mixture that is introduced into the 
combustion chambers of an internal combustion engine. A better mixture 
preparation promotes both a cleaner and a more efficient combustion 
process, a desirable goal from the standpoint of both exhaust emissions 
and fuel economy. The state of the art contains a substantial number of patents 
relating to air assist atomization technology. The technology recognizes 
the benefits that can be gained by the inclusion of special assist air 
passages that direct the assist air into interaction with the injected liquid 
fuel. Certain air assist fuel injection systems use pressurized air, from 
either a pump or some other source of pressurization, as the assist air. 
Other systems rely on the pressure differential that exists between the 
atmosphere and the engine's induction system during certain conditions of 
engine operation. It is a common technique to mount the fuel injectors in 
an engine manifold or fuel rail which is constructed to include assist air 
passages for delivering the assist air to the individual injectors. It is known from commonly assigned PCT/EP 92/00255 to construct 
an air assist atomizer in which the definition of the final length of the assist 
air passage to each fuel injector tip is provided by the cooperative 
organization and arrangement of two additional parts which form an 
atomizer assembly disposed between the nozzle of an injector and the 
wall of a socket that receives the injector. One advantage of that  
 
invention is that it adapts an otherwise conventional electrically-operated 
fuel injector for use in an air assist  
 
system without the need to make modifications to the basic injector, and 
without the need to make special accommodations in the 
injector-receiving socket other than suitably dimensioning the socket to 
accept the air assist atomizer. The air assist atomizer of the present invention is similar to that of 
PCT/EP 92/00255 in that it comprises the cooperative organization and 
arran
