<ABSTRACT>
The tube (41) has at the upper end a perimetric 
rim (45) projecting longitudinally, in other words 

axially, and inside and beneath said rim (45) a 
connecting grid (49) between the outer wall (41A) of 

the tube and an inner collar (51) which may be axially 
projecting.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a synthetic resin tube 
for winding yarn intended for dyeing and other 
treatments, the tube being made to enable it to be used 
with an end block which is the subject of another 
simultaneous patent held by the same applicant, without 
requiring adjustments for variation of the machine, 
while making it possible to maintain the useful 
dimensions for the bobbin as in the tubes in use at the 
present time, which are provided with an upper circular 
aperture for centering. These and other objects and advantages will be 
clearly understood from the following text. Essentially, the tube in question has at its upper 
end a perimetric rim projecting longitudinally, in 
other words axially, and inside and beneath said rim a 
connecting grid between the outer wall of the tube and 
an inner collar which may project axially beyond the 
grid. The inner collar may be more or less axially 
projecting beyond the perimetric rim. Said perimetric rim is slightly further inward 
than the outer wall of the tube, to permit mutual 
support and centering between a number of identical 
superimposed tubes. The drawing shows in detail a possible embodiment 
of the tube in question together with an end block disk 
and a base disk with which the tube in question, as 
well as other types of tube currently in use, may be 
used. In the drawing, 
Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show said end block disk in  
 
diametric section and in views along II-II and III-III 
in Fig. 1; Figs. 4, 5, and 6 show, in a similar way to Figs. 
1, 2, and 3, the base disk in diametric section and in 
views along V-V and VI-VI in Fig. 4; Fig. 7 is an exploded view of the base disk and 
the end block as shown in the preceding figures and the 
tube in question, in partial schematic axial section; 
and Fig. 8 is a view of said tube from the line VIII-VIII 
in Fig. 7. Figs. 1 to 3 show a disk 1 forming an end block, 
and having on the outer face a central projection 3 and 
an annular rim 5 at a limited distance from the 
periphery of the disk, together with an intermediate 
annular depression 7 which surrounds the central 
projection 3. This end block disk is the subject of 
another simultaneous patent held by the same applicant. 
On the lower face, which is to make contact with the 
top of the tubes, the end block disk has, from the 
outside, a first perimetric annular frontal supporting 
rim 9 immediately adjacent to the periphery of the 
disk. This is followed by a frustoconical shoulder 10, 
which is followed by a second annular supporting rim

<CLAIMS>
1) A synthetic resin tube for winding yarn intended 
for dyeing and other treatments, having at the upper 

end a perimetric rim (45) projecting longitudinally, in 
other words axially, and inside and beneath said rim a 

connecting grid (49) between the outer wall (41A) of 
the tube (41) and an inner collar (51), a circular 

aperture (53) being delimited by said inner collar 
(51). 
2) The tube as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
collar (51) is axially projecting with respect to the 

grid (49). 
3) The tube as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
perimetric rim (45) is axially less projecting than the 

collar (51). 
4) The tube as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
inner collar (51) is axially less projecting than the 

perimetric rim (45).
