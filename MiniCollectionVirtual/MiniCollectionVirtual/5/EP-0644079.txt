<ABSTRACT>
A main switch with a low withstand voltage usable 
to prevent a leak current from flowing from a floated 

running power supply by way of the main switch even 
when the insulation between the main switch and the 

body grounding is reduced. A running power supply for 
supplying power to a running motor, which includes a 

plurality of batteries connected in series to each 

other, is kept in the floating state with respect to 
the body grounding. Moreover, there is provided a step-down 

DC-DC converter of an input-output insulation 
type. A diode and a main switch are provided from a 

battery constituting part of the running power supply 
in this order to supply a starting power or starting 

signal to the DC-DC converter for starting the DC-DC 
converter. Thus, power is supplied to the input side of 

the DC-DC converter from the running power supply, to 
obtain a step-down accessary power supply VB.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power supply 
unit for an electric motor vehicle capable of obtaining 
an accessary power supply from a running power supply 
kept in the floating state by way of an input-output 
insulation type DC-DC converter, wherein one end of the 
accessary power supply is connected to the body 
grounding. In particular, the present invention 
concerns a power supply unit for an electric motor 
vehicle in which a power or signal for starting an 
accessary power supply is obtained from a running power 
supply by way of a main switch such as an ignition key, 
wherein a switch having a low withstand voltage is 
usable and a leak current is prevented from flowing the 
running power supply even when the insulation between 
the contact of the main switch and the body grounding 
is lowered. In general, an electric motor vehicle includes a 
running power supply and an accessary power supply. 
The running power supply is adapted to mainly supply  
 
power to a running motor. The running power supply 
includes, generally, a high voltage from several tens 
to several hundreds of volts (V), and is thereby kept 
in the floating state, one end of the power supply is 
not connected to the body grounding. The accessary power supply is adapted to supply 
power required for various controllers and lighting 
devices, and has generally a low voltage of 12 to 24 V 
or less. Accordingly, one end of the accessary power 
supply is connected to the body grounding for lowering 
the grounding impedance of the accessary power supply; 
and a body made of metal is employed as the return path 
of the drive current for a lighting device thereby 
omitting the wiring used for the current return path.  
 Known from GB-A-2 235 836 is an electric vehicle wherein an 
auxiliary battery is provided for driving electric appliances of 
the vehicle. To charge the auxiliary battery, the voltage of a 
main battery of the vehicle is supplied to the primary side of a 
dc-dc converter which is connected to the auxiliary battery with 
its secondary side. The operation of the dc-dc converter can be 
switched on and off by a switch provided between the main battery 
and the primary side of the dc-dc converter. Such an electric motor vehicle includes a special battery as an 
accessory power supply separately from the running power supply. 
However, to  
 
reduce the space for mounting the battery and the 
weight of the battery, there has been mostly used an 
electric motor vehicle of a type having an input-output 
insulation type
