<CLAIMS>
A filter housing (1) for separating a two-phase mixture 
consisting of gaseous and solid constituents, which is 

divided by a rigid plate (4) provided with openings into 
a crude gas chamber (2) positioned at the bottom and a 

pure gas chamber (3) positioned at the top above the 
crude gas chamber, wherein filter elements (5) leading 

downwardly into the crude gas chamber are attached in the 
openings of the rigid plate, a two-phase flow can be 

introduced into the crude gas chamber, the pure gas 
chamber has an outlet (14), positioned above the filter 

elements, for the gaseous constituents of the flow freed 
from the solid constituents by the filter elements, and 

cleaning devices (22) for backwashing the filter elements 
are associated with the filter elements (5),
characterised in that
 to contain the two-phase flow a 
pipe system (7) running at least partially in the 

interior of the crude gas chamber (2) and branching 
between the filter elements (5) is provided, which 

divides the two-phase flow into at least two partial 
streams and conveys these partial streams upwards past 

the filter elements (5) into the vicinity of the rigid 
plate (4) where the partial streams emerge though 

apertures from the pipe system (7) into the crude gas 
chamber (2),
and in that,
 in the vicinity of the outlet point of the 
partial streams from the pipe system (7), deflecting 

devices (4, 12), which deflect the partial streams in the 
crude gas chamber freely downwards, are disposed in the 

crude gas chamber. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the pipe system (7) includes a 
distributor (9), from which individual pipes (11, 21)  

 
open at their ends lead substantially vertically upwards 

to the rigid plate (4). 
A device according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the distributor (9) is constructed 
as a distribution chamber disposed centrally in the crude 

gas chamber (2). 
A device according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the distributor (9) is constructed 
as a closed circular pipeline disposed peripherally in or 

outside the filter housing (1). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the regions of the rigid plate (4) 
lying opposite the outlet points of the partial streams 

serve as deflecting devices. 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 caps (12), which freely protrude as 
baffle plates over the outlet points of the partial 

streams, are used as deflecting devices. 
A device according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 in segments of the rigid plate (4) 
in each case several filter elements (5) are combined to 

form groups (15) and the individual pipes (11, 21) are 
run (11, 21) in spaces between these groups (15). 
A device according to Claim 7,
characterised in that
 a cleaning device (22) is 
associated with each group (15) of filter elements (5). 
A device according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 the cleaning devices (22) are 
constructed as counter-flow ejectors (22).  

 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the filter elements (5) are 
constructed as filter cartridges or filtering bags 

leading downwardly from the rigid plate (4). 
A device according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the filter elements (5) are 
made of ceramic material. 
Use of a filter housing (1) in accordance with Claim 
1 for separating a two-phase flow having a 

temperature of between approximately 200 and 800Â°C 
at pressures in the filter housing (1) of between 

approximately 0.75 and 50 bar.
