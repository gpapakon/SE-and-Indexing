<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a men's disposable urine
retaining bag adapted to be used, for example, bedridden
patients, aged men or incontinent patients.Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No. 1997-38126
describes a men's disposable urine holding bag dimensioned to
be larger in its longitudinal direction and comprising a
liquid-pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious backsheet and a
liquid-absorbent core disposed between these two sheets. The
bag is formed along a part of its upper edge adjacent one end
thereof with a penis insertion mouth extending through the
sheets and core. The bag is torn along a guide line by an
appropriate length depending on a length of the wearer's penis
to form the mouth for insertion of the wearer's penis and then
the penis is inserted into the bag through the mouth in actual
use of the bag.Japanese Patent Application Disclosure No. 1997-38127
describes a men's disposable urine retaining bag dimensioned
to be larger in its longitudinal direction and comprising a
liquid-pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious backsheet and a
liquid-absorbent core disposed between these two sheets. The
bag is formed with a cutout extending downward from the upper 
part toward the lower part of the bag. The penis is inserted
into the bag through the cutout.With the bags described in these Japanese Patent
Application Disclosure Nos. 1997-38126 and 1997-38127, the
mouth or the cutout must be outstretch to define spaces within
the bag so that the penis can be inserted thereinto. To achieve
this, the bag must be pushed inward from transversely opposite
sides of the bay so that the mouth or the cutout may be
appropriately outstretched. However, the mouth or cutout,
therefore, the space defined within the bag is collapsed as soon
as the bag is relieved of the pressure exerted on the
transversely opposite sides. This is for the reason that both
of these bags have their initial shapes flattened due to join
lines extending along their longitudinally opposite ends as
well as transversely opposite side edges.The glans penis must be inserted into the bag through the
mouth or cutout and it is difficult to maintain the mouth or
cutout in its outstretched position. As a result, an operation
of inserting the penis into the bag may be delayed.
Additionally, both of these bags have their plane figures which
are substantially rectangular and, in consequence, the lower
ends of these bags are not well fitted to the with wearer's crotch.
Such may give the wearer uncomfortable feeling. It is an object of this invention

<CLAIMS>
A men's disposable urine retaining bag comprising:

a generally inverted trigonal pyramid defined by a front
wall section and first and second side wall sections which are

formed with a liquid-absorbent panel and a liquid-impermeable
sheet covering an outer surface of the liquid-absorbent panel;
the bag having a first foldable line which extends along
a longitudinal boundary between the front wall section and the

first side wall section, a second foldable line which extends
along longitudinal boundary between the front wall section and

the second side wall section, and a third foldable line which
extends along a longitudinal boundary between the first and

second side wall sections; and a mouth for insertion of the penis

defined by upper peripheral edges of the front wall section and
a pair of side edges of the first and second side wall section

which are separated along the third foldable line of the first
and second side walls.
The bag according to Claim 1, wherein said mouth is
provided with fastening means.
The bag according to Claim 1, wherein at least one of said
front wall section and said first and second side wall sections

is provided along said mouth with an elastically stretchable
member.

said walls of said bag except said mouth.
The bag according to Claim 1, wherein first compressed
grooves formed by compressing said bag in its thickness

direction and being convex outwardly of said bag extend along
a longitudinal center line of said front wall section and said

first and second foldable lines.

grooves formed by compressing said bag in its thickness

direction and being convex inwardly of said bag longitudinally
extend between said longitudinal center line and respective

said first and second foldable lines and longitudinally extend
between respective said first and second foldable lines and said

third foldable line.
