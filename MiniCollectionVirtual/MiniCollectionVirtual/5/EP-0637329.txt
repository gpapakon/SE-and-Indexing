<ABSTRACT>
An improved polystyrene foam having less corrugation is disclosed which uses carbon dioxide as the blowing agent and 1-30 weight percent endothermic agent, such as water, with the weight based on the total carbon dioxide blowing agent and endothermic agent weight. This combination of carbon dioxide and endothermic agent decreases the corrugation of the thermoplastic foam, while just slightly increasing density, when the process parameters, including throughput, are equivalent to using only carbon dioxide. The process also allows an increased foaming temperature and greater process throughput of an equivalent density thermoplastic foam at approximately equivalent corrugation levels when compared to the use of only using carbon dioxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to
a
process for making an improved polystyrene foam utilizing an endothermic agent and
carbon dioxide as the only blowing agent. This invention is particularly suited for making
polystyrene foam sheet having a thickness of less than 0.5 inch (12.7 millimeters (mm)).Polystyrene foam, particularly in sheet form, is at the present time made from any
number of blowing agents which may possess or cause one or more of the following
undesirable characteristics: volatility, flammability, poor thermoforming characteristics, brittle
foam sheet physical properties, high cost or an adverse effect to the ozone layer. Examples of
these blowing agents would include aliphatic hydrocarbons and fully or partially halogenated
hydrocarbons.Some have experimented with blends of carbon dioxide and other blowing
agents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons or fully or partially halogenated hydrocarbons. An
example of this can be seen in United States Patent Numbers 4,344,710 and 4,424,287. These,
patents, however, state that the use of a 100 percent carbon dioxide blowing agent has not
been successfully employed in continuous direct injection foam sheet manufacturing (Column
1, lines 42-45 and lines 49-55 respectively) due to the extreme volatility. Use of these materials
is said to produce corrugation and surface defects.Others have developed methods and apparatuses for metering a gaseous blowing
agent, such as an atmospheric gas, into a molten resin charge, such as polystyrene, in an
accurate and precise manner. One example of this can be seen in United States Patent Number
4,470,938. The apparatus of this patent meters discrete uniform volumetric charges of gaseous
blowing agent into the molten resin using a free piston-cylinder combination which is given
notice power by the supply gas source.Still others, in United States Patent 4,455,272, have formed polystyrene foam by
extruding polystyrene, a nucleating agent, a physical blowing agent, and water where the
physical blowing agent and water are injected separately or together into extruder as a
blowing agent. The product produced has small cells at junction points between membranes of
the foam. The patent states that extrusion processes for producing such foam are well known
in the art and are normally based on known prior art physical blowing agents such as lower
hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons, including propane, normal and isobutane, all of
the isomeric pentanes and hexanes and halogenated hydrocarbons exemplified by Freon 11, 
trichlorofluoro

A process for producing a thermoplastic foam comprising the following steps:

(a) melting a styrenic polymer having at least 70 percent by weight styrene monomeric units;
(b) introducing into the melted styrenic polymer a blowing agent;
(c) introducing a nucleating agent into the melted styrenic polymer in an amount of 0.005 to 1.0
weight percent based on styrenic polymer weight;
(d) mixing intimately the melted styrenic polymer and the blowing agent; and
(e) extruding and foaming the mixture into a region of lower pressure to form the thermoplastic
foam, the process being characterized in that the blowing agent consists essentially of carbon

dioxide used in an amount of 0.5 to 6 weight % of the styrenic polymer, the process being
further characterized in that water as an endothermic agent is introduced into the melted styrenic

polymer in an amount of from one percent to thirty percent by total weight of
the carbon dioxide and the endothermic agent and in an amount of from 0.1 to 1.0 weight % based

on the weight of the styrenic polymer, and the process being further characterized in that the
mixture is extruded and foamed at a die temperature no greater than 150°C and the obtained

foam has a density in the range of 32 to 160 kg/m
3

density with equivalent corrugation to a thermoplastic foam produced under equivalent

process conditions without the endothermic agent, but is extruded, foamed and formed in greater
quantities due to an increased foaming temperature when compared to an equivalent process
