<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a process for converting high molecular weight essentially water insoluble polymers having repeating or multiple ether linkages in the polymer backbone into their corresponding alcohols and other monomeric and lower weight oligomeric units by forming an aqueous mixture of the polymer in a ratio by weight of liquid water to polymer of at least 1:1, preferably neutral water, and heating the mixture under autogeneous pressure at a temperature of from about 200  DEG C to about the critical temperature of water (374  DEG C), more preferably from about 200  DEG C up to about 350  DEG C. Heating is continued for a period of time sufficient to depolymerize the polymer, depending on temperature and the amount of water present, and the number of polymeric ether linkages in the feedstock, and the amount of conversion desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for depolymerizing high molecular
weight polymers having multiple or repeating ether linkages in the backbone to
alcohols, and other monomeric and lower molecular weight oligomeric units.Generally speaking, waste polymers containing repeating ether linkages are
less commercially valuable than the corresponding alcohol and monomeric and lower
molecular weight oligomeric products which may be produced by cleavage of (c-o)
linkages in the polymer backbone. Such waste polymers are generally not easily
biodegradable and due to their high molecular weight also are not water soluble.
Current processes, such as described in U.S. Patent 4,806,658, require the addition of
catalysts to depolymerize these polymers.In US-A-5,043,486 there is disclosed a method for cleaving ethers, particularly
of the type R(OR')n, having low molecular weights; which in the context of the disclosed
ethers means up to 2,000. The ethers are cleaved in water under temperature and
autogeneous pressure.The present invention provides a process for depolymerizing high molecular
weight polymers having ether linkages in the backbone, consisting of:
(a) forming, in the absence of a depolymerization catalyst, a mixture of
neutral water and a water-insoluble polymer having multiple ether linkages in the
backbone and a molecular weight of at least 5,000; and(b) heating the aqueous mixture to a temperature within the range of from
200°C up to the critical temperature of water under autogeneous pressure of the system
for a period of time sufficient to depolymerize said polymer into lower molecular weight
compounds including alcohols.The starting polymers have multiple or repeating ether linkages in the
backbone and they are insoluble in water at 25°C. The process of the invention converts
these polymers into their corresponding lower molecular weight products, viz. alcohols,
monomeric products and lower molecular weight oligomeric products.The mixture of neutral water and polymer is heated from 200°C to critical
water temperature under autogeneous pressure of the system, which temperature is
about 374°C. The preferred temperature for the heating is in the range 200°C to 350°C.The invention is applicable to the cleavage of high molecular weight polymers
having multiple or repeating ether linkages in the backbone. Such polymers are
typically not water-soluble and will have an average molecular weight of greater than or
equal to 5,000, more typically from 20,000 and most typically from 100,000.
