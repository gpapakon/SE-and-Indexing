<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to photographic processing
and, in particular, to a method of redox amplification
processing.Redox amplification processes have been
described, for example in British Specification Nos.
1,268,126, 1,399,481, 1,403,418 and 1,560,572. In
such processes colour materials are developed to
produce a silver image (which may contain only small
amounts of silver) and then treated with a redox
amplifying solution (or a combined developer-amplifier)
to form a dye image.The developer-amplifier solution contains a
colour developing agent and an oxidising agent which
will oxidise the colour developing agent in the
presence of the silver image which acts as a catalyst.Oxidised colour developer reacts with a colour
coupler to form the image dye. The amount of dye
formed depends on the time of treatment or the
availability of colour coupler and is less dependent
on the amount of silver in the image as is the case in
conventional colour development processes.Examples of suitable oxidising agents include
peroxy compounds including hydrogen peroxide and
compounds which provide hydrogen peroxide, e.g.
addition compounds of hydrogen peroxide.Any solution containing both a colour developing
agent and hydrogen peroxide is inherently unstable as
the peroxide tends to react with the colour developing
agent and destroy it. Many proposals have been made on
how this instability can be overcome but without 
providing the solution stability of conventional
colour processing.One of such proposals is to add oxidant to a
colour developer solution only when it is needed and
to remove it after use, recycling the colour developer
solution which is left. Such methods need elaborate
control mechanisms, especially at start-up, in order
to ensure a practical system.WO-A-92/07299 discloses a process for producing a
photographic colour image in a redox-amplification
process wherein a separate colour developer bath
containing diethylhydroxylamine and a separate redox-amplification
bath comprising hydrogen peroxide is
used.EP-A-0616255 and EP-A-0620487, both cited under
Article 54(3), disclose respectively the processing of
high chloride T-grain materials by a redox-amplification
process using hydrogen peroxide as
preferred oxidising agent, and the processing of a
material by redox-amplification wherein excess
hydrogen peroxide is removed after an amplifier bath
before returning the material to a developer bath.FR-A-2408857 describes redox-amplification using
a cobalt III complex and peroxide in separate
solutions, the pH of
