<DESCRIPTION>
 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF DISEASES WITH INTERFERON WHILE REDUCING SIDE EFFECTSThe present invention relates to methods of treatment of diseases using consensus human leukocyte interferon. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions of consensus human leukocyte interferon that are suitable for the treatment of diseases.Background of the InventionInterferons are a subclass of cytokines that exhibit both antiviral and antiproliferative activity. On the basis of biochemical and immunological properties, human interferons are grouped into three classes: interferon-alpha (leukocyte), interferon-beta (fibroblast) and interferon-gamma (immune) . At least fourteen alpha interferons (grouped into subtypes A through H) having distinct amino acid sequences have been identified by isolating and sequencing DNA encoding these polypeptides. Alpha interferons have received considerable attention as potential therapeutic agents due to their antiviral and antitumor growth inhibition.The purification of interferon from human leukocytes isolated from the buffy coat fraction of whole blood is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,503,035. Human leukocyte interferon prepared in this manner contains a mixture of different human leukocyte interferon amino acid sequences . The purified material has a specific activity of from 0.9 x 10^-4 x 108 units/mg. of protein when assayed on the MDBK bovine cell line and from 2 x 106-7.6 x 108 units/mg. of protein when assayed on the Ag 1732 human cell line. The cytopathic effect inhibition assay used to 

determine interferon anti-viral activity is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,241,174. The measured interferon activity was calibrated against a reference standard for human leukocyte interferon provided by the National Institutes of Health.The construction of recombinant DNA plasmids containing sequences encoding at least part of human leukocyte interferon and the expression in £. coli of a polypeptide having immunological or biological activity of human leukocyte interferon is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,530,901.The construction of hybrid alpha-interferon genes containing combinations of. different subtype sequences (e.g., A and D, A and B, and A and F) is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,414,150, 4,456,748, and 4,678,751.U.S. Patents Nos. 4,695,623 and 4,897,471 disclose novel human leukocyte interferon polypeptides having amino acid sequences which include common or predominant amino acids found at each position among naturally-occurring alpha interferon
