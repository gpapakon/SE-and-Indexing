<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for 
preparation of 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid wherein the hydrogenation step is conducted 
continuously. It is well known in the art that 1,3- and 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid can be prepared from 
terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid by preparing a 
aqueous solution of the disodium salt of terephthalic 
acid or isophthalic acid, reducing the aromatic ring 
using a ruthenium catalyst, preparing the acid form 
by contacting the disodium salt with sulfuric acid 
and recovering the cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid by 
crystallization. Typical of this art is U.S. 
3,444,237 and U.S. 2,828,335. We have now discovered. a process which results 
in a very high yield of cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. 
In the process of this invention the yield of 
cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid is at least 85% 
preferably 90% and most preferably 95%. 
Broadly, the process of our invention can be 
described as a process for preparation of 1,3- or 
1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid comprising 
(A) preparing a solution which has a pH in the 
range of 7 to 13, a temperature in the 
range of 20° to 100° and is comprised of 
0.5 to 30.0 weight percent of the disodium 
salt of terephthalic acid or isophthalic 
acid and 99.5 to 70.0 weight percent water,  
 (B) continuously preparing the disodium salt of 
1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid by 
continuously contacting the solution with a 
combination of ruthenium metal and a carbon 
support in a packed column at a pressure in 
the range of 689,5 kPa to 13.790 kPa and a 
temperature in the range of 20° to 200°C, (C) preparing 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid by contacting 
the disodium salt of 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid with sulfuric 
acid or hydrochloric acid at pressure in 
the range of atmospheric to 275,8 kPa, and (D) recovering the 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid by 
crystallization of the 1,3- or 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic 
acid in less than 
60 minutes, at a temperature in the range 
of 130° to 20°C. In the first step of the invention, an aqueous 
solution of the disodium salt of terephthalic acid or 
isophthalic acid is prepared. Preferably the 
solution is formed by combining terephthalic acid or 
isophthalic acid with an aqueous solution of sodium 
hydroxide. The sodium hydroxide and terephthalic 
acid or isophthalic acid reacts to form the 
corresponding disodium salt in accordance with well 
known chemistry. This step can be practiced in 
commercial equipment well known in the art on
