<ABSTRACT>
The three-dimensional structure of crystalline pertussis 
holotoxin (PT) has been determined by X-ray crystallography. 

Crystal structures have also been determined for complexes of 
pertussis toxin with molecules relevant to the biological 

activity of PT. These three-dimensional structures were 
analysed to identify functional amino acids appropriate for 

modification to alter the biological properties of PT. 
Similar procedures may be used to predict amino acids which 

contribute to the toxicity of the holotoxin, to produce 
immunoprotective, genetically-detoxified analogs of pertussis 

toxin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method involving the
prediction of functional amino acid residues in pertussis toxin,
in order to manipulate the biological properties of the toxin, by
determination of and examination of the crystal structures of the
toxin alone and of complexes of the toxin with molecules relevant
to its biological activity, including carbohydrate ligands,
nucleotide effectors and substrates.Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a severe, highly contagious
respiratory disease of infants and young children caused by
infection with Bordetella pertussis. Owing to the many virulence
factors associated with this organism, the pathogenesis of the
disease is still not fully understood; however, it is generally
recognised that major systemic effects are caused by pertussis
toxin (PT). This material exhibits a wide range of biological
activities, as illustrated by such alternative names as
lymphocytosis-promoting factor, histamine-sensitising factor and
islet-activating protein (ref. 1- a list of the references appears
at the end of the disclosure, each of which reference is
incorporated herein by reference thereto).PT is a 105-kDa exotoxin encoded by the tox operon and
consists of five polypeptide subunits (S1 to S5) arranged in an A-B
structure typical of some bacterial toxins. The S2, S3, S4,
(two copies) and S5 subunits 
form a pentamer (the B oligomer) which when combined with
the S1 subunit forms the holotoxin. S1 is an enzyme with
ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD-glycohydrolase activities.
Its natural function is to catalyse the transfer of the
ADP-ribose portion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD) to the membrane-bound guanine nucleotide-binding
negative regulatory G-protein of adenylate cyclase (Gi),
resulting in an increase in cyclic-AMP synthesis. This
activity, which is the primary cause of PT toxicity, can
be conveniently examined in vitro using as substrate the
retinal G-protein transducin, which is a close analogue
of Gi (ref. 2). Such studies have demonstrated that PT
is activated by adenine nucleotides, in particular by
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (refs. 3,4), while S1 itself
is active only in the presence of thiols, such as
dithiothreitol, that are required to reduce the single
disulfide bond of S1 (ref. 5).The B oligomer mediates the binding of the holotoxin
to target cells and facilitates entry of the A protomer.
PT has lectin-like properties, binding to glycoconjugates
on many cell surfaces and to the oligosaccharide moieties
of many serum glycoproteins (refs. 6,7). It
