<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of pivaloyl 
hydrazide by reaction between pivalic acid and hydrazine. GB-A-1396615 discloses the condensation of a carboxylic acid 
with ammonia, hydrazine or substituted hydrazine or a primary or 
secondary amine with a catalyst M(OR)nX(4-n) where M is titanium or 
zirconium, R is alkyl or aryl, X is halogen and n is 1-4. There 
is, however, in that document no reference to nor example of 
pivalic acid as the carboxylic acid. There are only examples of 
less hindered acids, namely nicotinic, iso-nicotinic, benzoic and 
acetic acids. Moreover, in all of the examples in which hydrazine 
is the other reactant, water is azeotroped out before addition of 
the catalyst, presumably with the intention of avoiding hydrolysis 
of the alkoxide group in the catalyst. It has, however, now been found that if the process 
exemplified in GB-A-1396615 is used for reaction of pivalic acid 
with hydrazine, namely in which water is removed before addition of 
the catalyst, lower yields of pivaloyl hydrazide are obtained than 
if the water is left in the mixture during such addition. The present invention therefore provides a process for the 
preparation of pivaloyl hydrazide which comprises reacting pivalic 
acid with hydrazine in the presence of a catalytic amount of 
amorphous titanium dioxide in an inert solvent, in the presence of 
water. The amorphous titanium dioxide is preferably prepared by 
addition to the pivalic acid/hydrazine mixture of a titanium 
compound which can form amorphous titanium dioxide upon such 
addition. Such titanium compound is preferably a titanium alkoxide 
or phenoxide, more preferably titanium tetra-isopropoxide or 
titanium tetra-phenoxide. Particularly good yields are obtained  
 
using titanium tetra-isopropoxide, there being no examples of such 
compound in GB-A-1396615. The molar percent of said titanium compound to the pivalic 
acid is preferably in the range of from 0.5 to 2. The solvent may be any suitable inert solvent, including in 
particular 2-methyl-1-butanol, n-butanol and s-butanol, in some 
circumstances together with toluene. 2-methyl-1-butanol is 
particularly preferred. The molar ratio of the hydrazine compound to the pivalic acid 
is preferably in the range of from 1.05 to 1.2. During the process the reaction mixture is preferably heated 
to its reflux temperature. Comparative tests have shown in fact that if crystalline 
titanium dioxide is used as catalyst instead of amorphous titanium 
dioxide, substantially inferior
