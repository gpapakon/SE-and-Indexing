<ABSTRACT>
A paper sheet guiding cylinder for a printing machine is mounted in the machine side frames, is drivingly linked to the printing machine drive, and has an outer casing provided with through holes. Means are provided for blowing air into the paper sheet guiding cylinder and means located inside the paper sheet guiding cylinder deflect the blown air in the direction of the cylinder casing. In order to deflect the blown air, a radial ventilator is rotatively mounted in the paper sheet guiding cylinder (11) and is linked to driving means which are independent from the paper sheet guiding cylinder. Through holes are provided in the side walls (20) of the paper sheet guiding cylinder (11).

Sheet guiding cylinder (11) of a printing 
machine, which cylinder is mounted in side frames of the 

printing machine and for which there is a drive connection 
to a printing-machine drive, having a cylinder 

casing provided with passage openings, having means for 
feeding compressed air into the sheet guiding cylinder 

(11), and having means for deflecting the compressed air 
inside the sheet guiding cylinder in the direction of the 

cylinder casing, characterized in that, for feeding 
compressed air into the sheet guiding cylinder (11) and 

for deflecting the compressed air inside the sheet 
guiding cylinder (11) in the direction of the cylinder 

casing coaxially with the axis of the sheet guiding 
cylinder (11), a rotatably mounted radial fan is provided, 

which communicates with the ambient air at the end 
face via passage openings (23) provided in side walls 

(20, 21) of the sheet guiding cylinder (11), has fan 
vanes (18, 19, 28, 29) arranged concentrically to the 

axis of the sheet guiding cylinder (11) and extending 
along the sheet guiding cylinder (11), and can be driven 

at a controllable speed by drive means which are independent 
of the sheet guiding cylinder (11). 
Sheet guiding cylinder of a printing machine 
according to the features of Claim 1, characterized in 

that inlet nozzles (24) are connected securely against 
rotation to the radial fan on at least one of the sides 

of the radial fan facing the side walls (20, 21) of the 
sheet guiding cylinder (11). 
Sheet guiding cylinder of a printing machine 
according to the features of Claim 2, characterized in  

 
that a cylindrical channel (43) is provided in an annular 

manner within the fan vanes (18, 19, 28, 29) of the 
radial fan which is arranged in an annular manner and 

concentrically relative to the cylinder axis, which 
channel extends in the axial direction and opens out into 

the inlet nozzle (24) in the axial direction. 
Sheet guiding cylinder of a printing machine 
according to the features of Claim 3, characterized in 

that the fan vanes of the radial fan are attached to said 

fan between two circular holding plates thereof, in that 
the holding plates are attached concentrically on the 

shaft (16, 32) of the radial fan, in that the shaft (16, 
32) is mounted concentrically in the sheet guiding 

cylinder, in that the holding plates each have inlet 
nozzles to provide the channel (43) with compressed air. 
Sheet guiding cylinder of a printing machine 
according to the features of Claim 3, characterized in 

that a shaft (16, 32) is rotatably mounted in the sheet 
guiding cylinder (11), concentrically thereto, in that 

one or two circular holding plates (17, 30, 31, 39, 40), 
disposed closely adjacently, are attached concentrically 

on the shaft (16, 32) in the middle of the width of the 
sheet guiding cylinder (11), in that the fan vanes (19, 

28, 29), which each extend parallel to the shaft axis and 
are arranged concentrically to the shaft (16, 32), are 

attached to the side faces of the one (17) or to the 
mutually averted sides of the two holding plates (30, 31, 

39, 40). 
Sheet guiding cylinder of a printing machine 
according to the features of one or more of the preceding 

claims, characterized in that the radial fan has a drive 
shaft (16), by means of which it is mounted concentrically 

to the sheet guiding cylinder (11), said driveshaft 
being extended outwards through the machine side 

wall on one side of the sheet guiding cylinder by means 
of a shaft journal (14) of the sheet guiding cylinder 

(11), and the outwardly projecting extension being 
connected in terms of drive to drive means, which can be 

controlled independently of the printing-machine drive,  
 

outside the machine side wall. 
Sheet guiding cylinder of a printing machine 
according to the features of one or more of Claims 1 to 

5, characterized in that the sheet guiding casing surface 
of the sheet guiding cylinder (11) has, at least over the 

angular range of sheet guiding of the sheet guiding 
cylinder (11), gripper strips (10) of the gripper chains 

(3) which are guided around the side walls of the sheet 
guiding cylinder (11), in that the radial fan has a shaft 

(32) which is mounted concentrically to the chain guiding 
wheels (5, 6) and is connected in terms of drive to 

independently controllable drive means which are arranged 
on an inner side of a machine side wall between the two 

strands of a chain. 
Sheet guiding cylinder of a printing machine of 
one or more of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 

direction of rotation of the radial fan can be changed.
