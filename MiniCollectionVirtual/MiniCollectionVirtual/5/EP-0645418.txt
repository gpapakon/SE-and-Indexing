<CLAIMS>
A flame-retardant rigid polyurethane foam containing
no fluorochlorohydrocarbons and containing, as

flame-retardant system, a combination of about 40 %
by weight of ammonium polyphosphate and about 60 %

by weight of tris(chloroisopropyl) phosphate.
A process for producing a rigid polyurethane foam as
claimed in claim 1, which comprises, during the

production of the foam, adding the flame-retardant
system in the form of a paste which has been rendered

thixotropic with finely divided silicic acid,
modified castor oil derivatives, organically modified

phyllosilicates or mixtures of these.
The process for producing a rigid polyurethane foam
as claimed in claim 2, wherein 2-chloropropane is

used during production of the foam as blowing agent
containing no fluorochlorohydrocarbons and the foam

contains from 10 to 50 parts by weight of the flame-retardant
system per 100 parts by weight of polyol

used.
The process for producing a rigid polyurethane foam
as claimed in claim 2, wherein pentane is used in

production of the foam as blowing agent containing
no fluorochlorohydrocarbons and the foam contains 

from 30 to 70 parts by weight of the flame-retardant
system per 100 parts by weight of polyol used.
The process for producing a rigid polyurethane foam
as claimed in claim 3, wherein the foam contains

from 20 to 30 parts by weight of the flame-retardant
system per 100 parts by weight of polyol used.
The process for producing a rigid polyurethane foam
as claimed in claim 4, wherein the foam contains

from 40 to 60 parts by weight of the flame-retardant
system per 100 parts by weight of polyol used.
