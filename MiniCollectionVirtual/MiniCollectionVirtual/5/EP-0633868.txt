<ABSTRACT>
The present invention generally relates to mechanisms for preventing undesirable oxidation (i.e., oxidation protection mechanisms) of reinforcement materials in composite bodies. The oxidation protection mechanisms include getterer materials which are added to the composite body which gather or scavenge undesirable oxidants which may enter the composite body. The getterer materials may be placed into at least a portion of the composite body such that any undesirable oxidant approaching, for example, a fiber reinforcement, would be scavenged by (e.g., reacted with) the getterer. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the getterer material(s) form at least one compound (e.g., at least one glassy material) which acts as a crack sealant, thereby further enhancing the oxidation protection of the composite body. One or more ceramic filler materials which serve as reinforcements may have a plurality of superimposed coatings thereon, at least one of which coatings may function as a getterer. The coated materials may be useful as reinforcing materials in ceramic matrix composites to provide improved mechanical properties such as fracture toughness. The present invention also relates to improved composites which incorporate these materials, and to their methods of manufacture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The United States Government has some rights to certain aspects 
of this invention pursuant to Contract No. N00014-90-C-0160 between the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Lanxide Corporation. The present invention generally relates to mechanisms for 
preventing undesirable oxidation (i.e., oxidation protection 
mechanisms) of reinforcement materials in composite bodies. The 
oxidation protection mechanisms include getterer materials which are 
added to the composite body which gather or scavenge undesirable 
oxidants which may enter the composite body. The getterer materials 
may be placed into at least a portion of the composite body such that 
any undesirable oxidant approaching, for example, a fiber 
reinforcement, would be scavenged by (e.g., reacted with) the getterer. 
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the getterer 
material(s) form at least one compound (e.g., at least one glassy 
material) which acts as a crack sealant, thereby further enhancing the 
oxidation protection of the composite body. One or more ceramic filler 
materials which serve as reinforcements may have a plurality of superimposed 
coatings thereon, at least one of which coatings may function 
as a getterer. The coated materials may be useful as reinforcing 
materials in ceramic matrix composites to provide improved mechanical 
properties such as fracture toughness. The present invention also 
relates to improved composites which incorporate these materials, and 
to their methods of manufacture. A ceramic composite is a heterogeneous material or article 
comprising a ceramic matrix and filler such as ceramic particles, 
fibers or whiskers, which are intimately combined to achieve desired 
properties. These composites are produced by such conventional methods 
as hot pressing, cold pressing and firing, hot isostatic pressing, and 
the like. However, these composites typically do not exhibit a  
 
sufficiently high fracture toughness to allow for use in very high 
stress environments such as those encountered by gas turbine engine 
blades. A novel and useful method for producing self-supporting ceramic 
composites by the directed oxidation of a molten precursor metal is 
disclosed in Commonly Owned U.S. Patent No. 4,851,375, which issued on 
July 25, 1989, described below in greater detail. However, the 
processing environment is relatively severe, and there is a need, 
therefore, to protect certain fillers from the strong oxidation 
environment. Also, certain fillers may be reduced at least partially
