<ABSTRACT>
A cassette seal comprises a support (1) and a running ring (2) with an angled profile, which adjoin a hollow chamber (3). The support ring is connected to a sealing ring (4) which has a primary sealing lip, and the running ring has a magnetized pole ring made of a polymer, with circumferentially distributed poles. The pole ring is covered by a non-magnetic protecting ring.

<CLAIMS>
A cassette seal, comprising a supporting ring (1)
and a running ring (2) of in each case an

angularly limited profile, which are arranged
opposite and lying in each other and together

bound a cavity (3), the supporting ring (1) being
connected to a sealing ring (4) which has at least

one dynamically loaded first sealing lip (5) and a
second sealing lip (11) which is designed as a

front seal for the first sealing lip (5), the
first sealing lip (5) enclosing the running

surface (6) of the running ring (2) such that it
can rotate relative thereto and seals it under

resilient prestress, the running ring (2) being
connected to a magnetic pole ring (7), formed as a

signal generator, of polymeric material with poles
distributed in the circumferential direction, it

being possible for the pole ring (7) to be moved
past a sensor (8) in order to register a

rotational movement, and the pole ring (7) being
ar
ranged inside the cavity (3), 
characterized in
that
, on the side facing away from the running
ring (2), the pole ring (7) is covered by a non-magnetizable

protective ring (9) made of PTFE, the
protective ring (9) resting directly on the pole

ring (7) with contact and the protective ring (9)
being provided with a sealing surface (10) for the

second sealing lip (11). 
A cassette seal according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the sensor (8) is arranged
inside the cavity (3) and is fixed to the

supporting ring (1), and 
in that
 the sensor (8) is
connected in a signal-conducting manner to

evaluation electronics (12).
A cassette seal according to claim 2,

characterized in that
 the sensor (8) and the
evaluation electronics (12) are connected by a

flexible printed circuit board (13).
A cassette seal according to claim 3,

characterized in that
 the supporting ring (1) and
the sealing ring (4), and also the sensor (8), the

pole ring (7) and the flexible printed circuit
board (13) form a unit (14) that can be

preassembled.
A cassette seal according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the protective ring (9) is
formed by a protective film.
A cassette seal according to one of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 the protective ring (9) has
a thickness of 0.1 to 0.6 mm.
