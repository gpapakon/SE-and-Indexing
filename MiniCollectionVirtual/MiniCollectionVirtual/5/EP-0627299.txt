<ABSTRACT>
The process for thermoforming shapes on foamed 
thermoplastic material and cross-linked foamed 

thermoplastic material is performed continuously and 
includes, between the end of the foaming process and the 

beginning of the cooling step, the calendering of the 
sheets or bands (1). According to the type of calender 

(2,3,4) used, this thermoforming process allows to obtain 
items that can be folded in an accordion-like manner or can 

be rolled up like a blind.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
thermoforming shapes on foamed thermoplastic material and
cross-linked foamed thermoplastic material in sheets or
bands, as well as to a calender for use in such a process.It is known to currently manufacture mats, made of
foamed material, which are used in the camping sector or
individual gymnastics; in order to allow their easy
storage, they have the peculiarity of being foldable.Accordingly, it is known to manufacture these mats by
performing a thermoforming process after the complete
cooling of the foamed material.This entails heating or again preheating the material
and then passing it through a press to form folding lines.
This known method therefore entails shaping the
material, starting from a sheet-like shape, by performing a
second pressing operation that requires the application of
energy to heat the foamed material internally or locally,
and the use of machines achieving the partial compression
of the material.This leads to an increase in manufacturing times and
costs, thus increasing the overall cost of the product.German patent no. 3924316 discloses a foldable mat
made of foamed material, said mat having a first pair of
perpendicular lines extending along the entire length
thereof and a significant number of lines which are
perpendicular to the longitudinal ones.These perpendicular lines extend from the longitudinal 
mid axis of the mat toward both edges.A simple folding line and a double folding line is
obtained from the paired lines according to the individual
instances.In this solution it is thus possible to obtain a mat
that is foldable but has the drawback of being bulky when
folded, thus increasing storage costs.Known from US-A-3,240,845 is a method for the
production of container blanks formed of semi-rigid
polyurethane foam sandwich material. The method includes a
step wherein a band of sandwich material is fed through calenders
according to the preamble of claim 5,
which form grooves on the outer layers of both sides
of the sandwich material. The grooves are arranged opposite
each other and each have a depth of about one third of the
thickness of the cured sandwich material. The scored
sandwich material is heated to cure the polyurethane foam.
The grooves serve as score lines for the blank so that upon
folding of the blank, the grooves form a bread container
corner integrally connected to the polyurethane container
walls by a bridge of the polyurethane foam remaining between
the opposing grooves.However, the finished sandwich material
