an existing laundry or dishwashing machine includes means to supply 

detergent, rinse agents, fabric conditioners or the like to a working 
area of the machine from respective bulk containers, and means to 

provide control signals to the supply means at appropriate times for 
the dispensing of detergents, rinse agents, fabric conditioners and 

the like. 
There is also disclosed a washing machine having a working 
area in which a predetermined cycle of operations including filling, 

washing, draining, refilling and rinsing operations takes place under 
the control of a sequence controller, and wherein a dosing system 

includes at least one sensor (14,15) associated with the working area 
of the 

machine to provide output signals to a control device (13) dependant on 
the presence or absence of water at the sensor location, the control 

device including circuitry to determine the requirement for a washing 
agent from said output signals of said sensor, and to provide output 

signals to control the operation of at least one pump (10) whose inlet is 
connected to a bulk supply (11) of the liquid washing agent and whose 

outlet is lead to the working area of the machine. 
A method of converting a semi-automatic laundry or 
dishwashing machine, wherein a washing cycle is controlled by a 

sequence controller which initiates pre-wash, wash and rinse 
operations, to fully automatic operation by fitting the dosing system 

is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to dosing systems, and is 
particularly concerned with the controlled dosing of detergents, 
rinse agents, fabric conditioners and the like in industrial and 
domestic laundry and dishwashing equipment. In conventional laundry equipment, a powdered detergent is 
dispensed at the appropriate stage of the wash cycle by placing the 
detergent in a compartment separate from the washing compartment, and 
at the appropriate time flushing the detergent into the washing 
compartment with water. A similar approach is adopted to dispense 
liquid fabric conditioners, generally utilising a syphon type device 
to ensure complete delivery of the fabric conditioner. In order to simplify such equipment, and to remove the need 
to charge the detergent and fabric conditioner compartments of the 
machine before each wash cycle, it is proposed to use a liquid 
detergent and a liquid fabric conditioner, dispensed by means of a 
dosing pump operated at the appropriate times in the wash cycle. 
While such equipment can be easily designed into new machines, the 
conversion of existing laundry equipment is problematical and time 
consuming in that each individual machine or machine type will have a 
different set of electrical connections to be tapped in order to 
provide appropriate input signals for a dosing pump controller. An objective of the present invention is to provide a dosing 
system which can be simply and rapidly fitted to an existing laundry 
or dishwashing machine, requiring no connections to the machine's 
control circuitry, but including means to provide control signals at 
appropriate times for the dispensing of detergents, rinse agents, 
fabric conditioners and the like. Preferably the dosing system is 
supplied with detergent, rinse agents, fabric conditioners or the 
like from bulk containers, with the various materials to be dosed in 
liquid form. Most preferably, the materials to be delivered to the 
machine are pumped by means of a peristaltic pump, controlled by 
circuitry responsive to input signals from sensors placed at 
predetermined locations in the washing machine.  According to a first aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a dosing system which can be simply and rapidly fitted to an 
existing laundry or dishwashing machine, the dosing system including 
means to supply detergent, rinse agents, fabric conditioners or the 
like to a working area of the machine from respective bulk 
containers, and means to provide control signals to the supply means

A dosing system which can be simply and rapidly fitted to an 
existing laundry or dishwashing machine, the dosing system including 

means to supply detergent, rinse agents, fabric conditioners or the 
like to a working area of the machine from respective bulk 

containers, and means to provide control signals to the supply means 
at appropriate times for the dispensing of detergents, rinse agents, 

fabric conditioners and the like. 
The dosing system of claim 1, wherein the machine is 
supplied with detergent, rinse agents, fabric conditioners or the 

like in liquid form, the materials being delivered to the machine 
being pumped by means of respective motorised pumps controlled by 

output signals from control circuitry responsive to input signals 
from sensors placed at predetermined locations in the laundry or 

dishwashing machine. 
The dosing system of claim 2, comprising a plurality of 
sensors, a control circuit, and a pump for delivering liquid 

additives to the working area of a washing machine, the sensors being 
mountable to the washing machine so as to detect the presence or 

absence of water in predetermined areas of the machine. 
The dosing system of claim 2, comprising a plurality of 
sensors, a control circuit, and a pump for delivering liquid 

additives to the working area of a washing machine, the sensors being

electricity between two contacts exposed to the water, conduction of 

electricity indicating the presence of water at the sensor location. 
A laundry or dishwashing machine according to claim 5, 
wherein the sensor or sensors detect the presence or absence of water
