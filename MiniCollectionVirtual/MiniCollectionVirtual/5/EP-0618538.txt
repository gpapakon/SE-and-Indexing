<ABSTRACT>
An information processor comprising a tablet (10) for inputting script data; a timer 
(19) for outputting a time signal; a RAM (18) as a temporary storage means; a CPU 

(14) responsive to every input of the script data from the tablet (10) and storing in the 
RAM (18) both the input script data and the time signal being outputted at that instant 

from the timer (19); and a magneto-optical recorder/reproducer (8) for writing, on a 
disc (804) as a recording medium, the time signal and the script data stored in the RAM 

(18). The information processor is capable of reproducing the script data in any of 
various modes inclusive of real time reproduction of each stroke, 10-stroke 

batch 
reproduction and 10-second batch reproduction, and can be formed into a small-sized 

structure while being equipped with a RAM of a great storage capacity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
information processor adapted for realizing a small-sized
portable computer.In a portable computer having a pen interface
with a script input and reproduce function, it is
necessary to hold script data which requires a greater
storage capacity in comparison with other data such as
character code and so forth. More specifically, the
sampling rate in a tablet is generally 100 points/second
or so, and therefore a total of 400 bytes are needed per
second if 2 bytes are allocated to X and Y coordinates
of each point. Supposing that 1 stroke (from pen-down
to pen-up) is written in 0.2 second on the average, the
storage capacity required per stroke amounts to 80
bytes. In an example where 1 character is written with
8 strokes on the average, the total required capacity
per character amounts to 80 Ã— 8 = 640 bytes. Since a
character code is expressed by 2 bytes according to the 
JIS code or Shift JIS code, it follows that the required
storage capacity becomes approximately 300 times of the
storage capacity necessary for storage of the characters itself.
Although the amount of script data can be compressed and
reduced by curtailing the points thereof, it is still
impossible to preserve the data in the storage capacity
equal to that for the character code.In any portable computer for processing script
data as described above, it is essential to incorporate
a great-capacity memory and also a random access memory
due to the necessity of editing and/or partially erasing
the script data. In view of this point, the following
problems are existent with regard to the read/write
memory means used heretofore.The performance is not satisfactory in respect
of the random access time and, in reproducing the
recorded script data, a considerable time is spent for
cueing the same. And in the process of partially
erasing the recorded data and rewriting some other data,
there is a restriction that the new data needs to be
smaller in size than the former data.Fundamentally, adequate flexibility is not
attainable in interchanging the data with an external 
apparatus since it is impossible to take out a recording
medium and replace the same, whereby the script data is
not interchangeable with facility. Script data of a
relatively great content requires a memory having a
great storage capacity, so that the requisite is not
satisfied completely with respect to the storage
capacity either.When a semiconductor memory is used, it is
possible to form both a read-only area, a write-only
area and a
