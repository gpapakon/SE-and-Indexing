<ABSTRACT>
A towed streamer including buoyant core (1), and strength members (3) to transmit tension along the streamer. Strength members (3) are arranged so that the streamer is compliant for a predetermined elongation of the streamer. Members (3) are embedded in an inner jacket (5) surrounded by an outer jacket (6). The assembly is encased in an extruded outer jacket (2). Braided data bearers (4) can be provided between the inner jackets (5, 6). Strength members (3) can be braided with interstices impregnated with gel. Where the strength members (3) are of non-compliant material, the braid is initially compliant where the streamer is slightly elongated but becomes non-compliant as the streamer elongates further. Alternatively a combination of compliant (3) and non-compliant members (14) can be used where the compliant members (3) only become engaged after a predetermined elongation of the streamer.

<DESCRIPTION>
VIBRATION ISOLATION MODULES (VIM) FOR TOWED ARRAY STREAMERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the construction of towed streamers suitable for use as vibration isolation modules and the method of manufacture of such towed sections.Streamers are generally of one of two types. One such type are liquid filled an have been used as a prior art, and generally have strength members, the pay load and data transmission means within a liquid core with a jacket encapsulating these components. Such streamers are generally less robust than streamers of a generally solid nature.Towed streamers usually comprise an elongate buoyant streamer having spaced along its length the required payload. Streamers are generally made from several shorter modules which are joined together to form the full length, and the modules used along the length have varying structures and are designed to perform different functions. The reason for positioning more than one type of module along the length of the streamer is in part because prevaili ambient conditions and forces associated with towing vary along the length.Towed streamers are usually of considerable length and are subject to quite high towing strains and are consequently provided with rigid, high tensile or non-compliant strain members longitudinally to transmit tension along the streamer.It is necessary for towed streamers to be constructed to withstand towing tensions whilst also allowing sufficient flexibility for winching onto a bollard or the like and problems are generally encountered in maintaining the spacing and/or position of strength members during such winching.When using towed streamers consisting of a towing section, active section and tail sections, vibrational energy is generated from both the towing and the tail end. The forward end energy arises from ships' motor, machinery and propeller vibration, and flow induced vibration from normal and tangential flow over the towing section. The tail end energy arises from tangential and 

normal flow over the tail end sections, especially where the tail end is attached to a surface buoy. Where the tail has a free end, vortex sledding from the tail produces lateral motion which translates into axial vibration.The vibration energy is picked up by the sensors in the active section of the streamer, from two mechanisms (a) physical movement of the sensor and (b) through pressure generated in the fluid which normally surrounds the sensor.Towed streamers by their nature are deployed from and recovered into the

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 22 December 1992 (22.12.92) ; original claims 2 and 8 deleted ; remaining claims amended and renumbered as claims 1 -8 (2 pages )]
1. A towed streamer including an inner portion, said inner portion including a central core (1), and strength members (3) positioned to transit tension along the streamer, arranged to render the streamer compliant for a predetermined elongation of the streamer, and when the streamer is elongated beyond the predetermined elongation the strength member acts to render the streamer non-compliant, said streamer including an outer jacket (2) encasing the inner portion.
2. A towed streamer as in claim 1 wherein the strength members (3) include compliant strength members (10) and non-compliant strength members (14), the non-compliant strength members being engaged only after a predetermined elongation of the streamer.
3. A towed streamer as in claim 2 wherein and the central core (1) includes a core tube (12) being filled with gel, and the non-compliant strength members (14) are aligned within the central core.
4. A towed streamer as in claim 2 wherein the central core includes a fluted central member (15) forming a plurality of longitudinal grooves, and the non compliant strength members are aligned within the grooves.
5. A towed streamer as in claim 1 wherein the module includes a data bearer layer, and the data bearer layer is formed of braided data wires (14).
6. A towed streamer as in claim 1 wherein the strength members (3) are braided with respect to one another and around the central core (1 ) so that after a predetermined elongation said strength members frictionally engage with one another and with the central core to render the streamer non- compliant.
7. A towed streamer as in claim 6 wherein the strength members (3) are compliant. 


8. A towed streamer adapted for use as a vibration isolation module as in claim 7 wherein a data bearer layer is formed outside of the strength members and takes the form of a braided data bearer wires (14).
