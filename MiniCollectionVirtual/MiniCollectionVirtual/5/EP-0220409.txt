<DESCRIPTION>
It is a well known observation that the biosynthesis 
of natural polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine and 
spermine, is elevated in rapidly proliferating cells 
relative to normal quiescent cells. Conversely, it is also 
known that the depletion of putrescine and spermidine leads 
to a reduction in cell proliferation. Ornithine is the metabolic precursor of putrescine, 
which in turn, is the metabolic precursor of spermidine, 
which in turn, is the metabolic precursor of spermine. 
Metabolically, these biochemical conversions are catalysed 
by the enzymes ornithine decarboxylase, spermidine synthase 
and spermine synthase, respectively. Additionally, spermidine 
and spermine synthase enzymes utilize decarboxylated-S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
as a co-substrate, the reaction 
product of the S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase 
enzyme. Inhibitors of these enzymes, including inhibitors 
of S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylase therefore, should 
serve to prevent the biosynthesis of putrescine and the 
higher polyamines derived therefrom, viz, spermidine and 
spermine, and should, theoretically, be effective as 
antiproliferative agents and/or antitumor agents. However, in the past, the use of irreversible 
ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors or inhibitors of S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
decarboxylase, spermidine synthase 
and spermine synthase has not proven to be totally 
effective. Thus, for example, putrescine and spermidine are  
 
not essential for the maintenance of cell viability as long 
as the preexisting spermine pool is maintained above a 
certain critical level. Moreover, a total invivo 
inhibition of the decarboxylase enzymes is difficult due to 
their rapid turnover. Applicants have discovered a class of compounds which 
antagonize spermine functions in the cell. These compounds 
are highly effective inhibitors of cell growth in rapidly 
proliferating cells. Accordingly, the compounds of this 
invention are useful as antiproliferative and antitumor 
agents. The present invention relates to certain selective 
gem-dihalo and tetrahalo derivatives of spermine. More 
particularly this invention relates to gem-dihalo or 
tetrahalo-1,12-diamino-4,9-diaza-dodecane derivatives 
having the formula 
wherein X and Y represent hydrogen or halogen, with the 
proviso that in the case of the dihalo derivatives both 
halogens are present on one and only one carbon atom, and 
in the case of the tetrahalo derivatives the compounds are 
2,2,11,11-halo-substituted; and the pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts
