<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device whereby a surface of 
a semiconductor body 1 is covered with an electrically insulating layer 8 and at least 

two electrical conductors 20, 23 are provided on the insulating layer next to one another 
and mutually separated by an interposed dielectric layer 21. The conductor 20 is formed 

from a first conductive layer deposited on the insulating layer. The upper surface and at 
least the flank 25 of the conductor 20 facing the other conductor are covered with the 

dielectric layer 21. Then a second conductive layer 22 is deposited over the entire 
surface which exhibits a step corresponding to the flank 25 of the first conductor. 

Subsequently, a mask 24 is formed which defines the second conductor, after which the 
second conductor 23 is formed from the second conductive layer through etching. 

According to the invention, the mask 24 is so aligned relative to the first conductor 20 
that the edge of the mask facing towards the flank 25 is situated above the dielectric 

layer on the flank of the first conductor. The layer 22 is etched isotropically, which 
etching is continued so long after the second conductive layer 22 has been entirely 

removed from above the first conductor that said step in the second conductive layer has 
been removed at least partly owing to underetching below the mask. The invention may 

advantageously be used for the manufacture of a charge coupled device in which the 
electrodes do not overlap one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor
device whereby a surface of a semiconductor body is covered with an electrically
insulating layer and at least two electrical conductors situated next to one another and
mutually separated by an interposed dielectric layer are provided on the insulating layer,
one of the conductors being formed from a first conductive layer deposited on the
insulating layer, after which the upper surface and at least the flank of said one
conductor facing towards the other conductor are covered with the dielectric layer,
whereupon a second conductive layer is deposited over the entire surface, which second
conductive layer exhibits a step corresponding to said flank of the first conductor, and
subsequently a mask is formed which defines the second conductor and the second
conductor is formed by means of etching from the second conductive layer which lies
against the dielectric layer on the flank of the first conductor. The invention also relates
to a semiconductor device manufactured by such a method.The invention is of particular importance for charge coupled devices in
which the electrical conductors form the gates or clock electrodes provided very closely
together above the CCD channel, serving to control the charge storage and charge
transport in the channel. The number of electrodes in this case is usually much greater
than two. Besides in CCDs, the invention may also be advantageously applied in other
types of semiconductor devices such as, for example, memories in which conductor
tracks are present at very small distances from one another. It should accordingly be
borne in mind that, although the invention will be explained below with particular
reference to a charge coupled device, the use of the invention is not limited to charge
coupled devices.A usual practice in the manufacture of charge coupled devices is to
provide the gates in a multilayer wiring in which the gates are provided in a higher
wiring (or conductor) layer so as to extend in an overlapping manner to above the gates
in a lower wiring layer. It is achieved thereby that the interspacings between the gates
are no greater than the thickness of an oxide layer on the flanks of the gates in the 
lower wiring layer. A major disadvantage of this method is that the capacitances caused
by this overlap are considerable and thus also the RC times of the electrodes, so that the
transport speed is low. Moreover, the energy consumption or dissipation during
operation is high owing to the high

A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device whereby a surface (2)
of a semiconductor body (1) is covered with an electrically insulating layer (8) and at

least two electrical conductors (20,23) situated next to one another and mutually
separated by an interposed dielectric layer (21) are provided on the insulating layer, one

insulating layer, after which the upper surface and at least the flank of said one

conductor facing towards the other conductor are covered with the dielectric layer,
whereupon a second conductive layer (22) is deposited over the entire surface, which

second conductive layer exhibits a step corresponding to said flank of the first
conductor, and subsequently a mask (24) is formed which defines the second conductor

and the second conductor is formed by means of etching from the second conductive
layer which lies against the dielectric layer on the flank of the first conductor, whereby

the mask is so aligned relative to the first conductor that the edge
(26) of the mask facing the flank is situated above the dielectric layer on the flank of

the first conductor, characterized in that the etching takes place isotropically and is continued so
long after the second conductive layer has been entirely removed from above the first

conductor that said step in the second conductive layer has at least been partly removed
owing to underetching below the mask.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the second
conductive layer (22) is provided to a thickness which is of the same order of magnitude

as the alignment tolerance with which the mask is provided.
A method as claimed in preceding Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
first conductive layer (20) is provided as a silicon la

formed by oxidation of said silicon layer.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims, characterized in
that etching of the second conductive layer is continued until the step in the second

conductive layer has disappeared.
