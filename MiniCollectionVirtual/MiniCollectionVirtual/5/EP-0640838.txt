<ABSTRACT>
In order in the case of a tachometer in a motor drive to be able firmly to mount the rotor, which consists of a brittle magnetic body, in a simple way on the shaft (5), the magnetic body (1) is arranged on the outer circumference of a plastic hub (2) which, for its part, is sprayed onto a metal bushing (3) which can be mounted in a resiliently elastic fashion without keeping to narrow dimensional (size) tolerances by an interference (press, force, driving) fit on the shaft (5); integrally formed on the bushing (3) are axially projecting spacer arms (3.1) which snap by means of claws (3.11) into an incision (5.1) of the shaft (5) and serve as an axial fixing stop for a shaft bearing (6).

<CLAIMS>
Shaft (5) having a magnet body (1) which is held 
concentrically on it, in particular for an auxiliary 

motor drive in a motor vehicle, having the features, 

a) the magnet body (1) is arranged on the outer circumference 
of a plastic hub (2), 
b) the plastic hub (2) is arranged, without touching 
the shaft (5), on the outer circumference of a 

metallic bush (3), 
c) the metallic bush (3) is held on the outer circumference 
of the shaft (5) by elastic tangential 

and/or radial stress. 
Shaft according to Claim 1 having the feature:
 
   d) the metallic bush (3) comprises a rolled steel sheet 

having an internal diameter which is smaller than 
the external diameter of the shaft (5), and having 

tangential and/or radial elasticity in order to 
achieve a push fit when a component unit, which 

comprises the magnet body (1), the plastic hub (2) 
and the metallic bush (3), is pushed onto the shaft 

(5). 
Shaft according to Claim 1 or 2 having the 
feature:
 
   e) the metallic bush (3) comprises a rolled steel sheet 

having axial longitudinal edges which are located 
one in front of the other in the circumferential 

direction and are connected by means of a catch 
(3.3) which is like a dovetail and has play. 
Shaft according to one of Claims 1-3 having the 
feature:
  
 

   f) the metallic bush (3) has the plastic hub (2) extrusion-coated 
on it. 
Shaft according to one of Claims 1-4 having the 
feature:
 
   g) the plastic hub (2) is designed to be intrinsically 

elastic in the radial direction, in particular as a 
result of recesses (2.1; 2.2) which are distributed 

over the circumference. 
Shaft according to one of Claims 1-5 having the 
feature:
 
   h) the metallic bush (3) is latched in a positively 

locking manner to the plastic hub (2), in particular 
by means of radial lugs (3.2) which are on the bush 

side and extend into the plastic hub (2). 
Shaft according to one of Claims 1-6 having the 
feature:
 
   i) the metallic bush (3) is provided with axially 

projecting, free spacer arms (3.1). 
Shaft according to Claim 7 having the feature:
 
   j) the free ends of the spacer arms (3.1) have claws 

(3.11) which are directed towards the shaft side and 
engage in a corresponding shaft notch (5.1). 
Shaft according to one of Claims 7 or 8 having 
the feature:
 
   k) the spacer arms (3.1) are designed, preferably 

integrally with the metallic bush (3) and the claws 
(3.11), to be prestressed elastically in the direction 

of the shaft (5). 
Shaft according to one of Claims 7-9 having the 
feature:
 
   l) the free ends of the spacer arms (3.1) are provided 

as axial stop means for a shaft bearing (6) which can be 
supported axially against them.
