<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a preparative
electrophoresis device and methods of using it.Electrophoresis involves the use of an electric
field to cause different charged molecules in a sample to
migrate through a gel at different rates, resulting in
separation of the different molecules. Separation is
based on charge and/or size differences between different
molecules. Molecules with higher charge migrate faster
than molecules with lower charge, and lower molecular
weight molecules migrate faster than the higher molecular
weight molecules.Because of the high resolving power of
electrophoresis, it is widely used to separate proteins
or peptides and polynucleotides, both as an analytical
technique (in which molecules remain in the gel) and as a
preparative tool (in which molecules are recovered). The
gel can be cylindrical in a tubular chamber, or it can be
flat in the form of a slab between two plates. Some
commercially available analytical slab devices use
disposable prepoured gels with thicknesses ranging
between 0.5 and 1.5 mm, and plates generally about 8 cm
high and about 10 cm wide; these are generally known as
"mini-gel" systems. some larger analytical gels employ
spacers 1.5 mm thick with plates generally about 15 cm
high and 18 cm wide.The molecules separated by electrophoresis can be
recovered from the gel by slicing the gel or by
electrophoretic transfer onto a membrane support.
Further processing is usually required to remove the
molecules from the gel or membrane support for further
purification procedures. This preparative procedure is
known as zone excision extraction. The separated molecules can also be recovered by
having them pass from the gel into a collection channel
and flushing the channel with a buffer. Because
different molecules enter the channel at different times
they will be eluted separately. This preparative
procedure is known as successive zone elution and
requires the use of a special gel construction to provide
a collection channel. These systems are typically of the
tube gel type, and often employ a cooling system to
dissipate the heat that is generated and can otherwise
affect electrophoresis owing to increased temperature.
The Model 491 system available from Bio-Rad Laboratories
is an example of such a system. Chen U.S. Patent No.
4,877,510 describes a cylindrical electrophoretic column
that has a chamber defined by a porous plate and a semipermeable
membrane thereunder for receiving and removing
molecules from the bottom of the column; electrophoretic
buffer passes
