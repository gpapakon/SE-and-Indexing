<ABSTRACT>
A non-helium expansion leak test technique is 
used to detect large leaks in a test part. The 

technique does not require the presence of helium or 
any other trace gas in the part being tested. The 

non-helium expansion technique is preferably used in 
conjunction with a helium mass spectrometer leak 

detector to permit leak detection over a large range 
of leak rates. A test part is placed in a sealed 

test fixture, and a valve between the test fixture 
and an expansion chamber is opened. The pressure in 

the expansion chamber is measured after the valve is 
opened. When the measured pressure is less than a 

reference pressure, a sealed part is indicated. 

When the measured pressure is greater than the 
reference pressure, a leaking test part is 

indicated. When a sealed test part is indicated, a 
helium mass spectrometer leak test is performed to 

determine the presence of small leaks in the test 
part. An atmospheric gross leak test can be 

performed simultaneously with the non-helium 
expansion leak test to detect large leaks in 

situations where some helium remains in the test 
part at the time of test.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to detection of leaks in
sealed parts and, more particularly, to a volume
expansion technique for leak detection which does
not require the presence of helium or any other
trace gas in the part being tested. An atmospheric
gross leak test can be performed simultaneously with
the volume expansion leak test to detect leaks in
situations where some helium remains in the part at
the time of test.It is frequently necessary to perform leak
testing of small sealed parts. An example is the
impact sensor used in the airbag system of an
automobile. The impact sensor includes an impact
switch that is activated by the deceleration of a
collision. The impact switch activates an airbag
inflation device. The impact switch is enclosed in 
a hermetically sealed container to prevent
contamination by moisture and other foreign matter.
Since proper operation of the impact sensor is
critical to the function of the airbag system, a
leak test must be performed on the impact sensor to
ensure seal integrity. The leak test must be
capable of detecting leaks over a wide range of leak
rates.One prior art technique for leak testing small
parts, such as impact sensors, involves immersion of
the part in a fluid such as a hydrofluorine compound
that has a low boiling point. Parts with leaks fill
up with the fluid. Then the parts are immersed in a
heated fluid which causes the hydrofluorine compound
to boil, thereby creating bubbles when there is a
leak. A human operator must observe the bubbles in
order to detect leaks. The bubble leak detection
technique is an extremely slow, unreliable and
expensive process. Furthermore, the bubble
technique is unable to detect very small leaks.Another prior art technique for detecting large
leaks involves measurement of the time required for
vacuum pumping. A part under test is placed in a
test fixture, and the test fixture is vacuum
pumped. The time required to reduce the test
fixture to a prescribed pressure is measured. When
the test part has a large leak, the time to reach
the prescribed pressure increases, thereby
indicating a leaky part.Yet another prior art leak detection technique 
involves the use of a helium mass spectrometer leak
detector. Helium is used as a trace gas which
passes through the smallest of leaks in a sealed
test part. After passing through a leak, a test
sample containing helium is drawn into a leak
detection instrument and is measured. An important
component of the instrument is a mass spectrometer
tube which detects and measures the helium. The
