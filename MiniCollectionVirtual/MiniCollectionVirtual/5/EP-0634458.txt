<ABSTRACT>
Lustre pigments based on coated, plateletlike, silicatic substrates wherein the coating comprises a layer consisting essentially of carbon and aluminium oxide, chromium oxide, serium oxide, zirconium oxide and/or antimony oxide are obtainable by applying carbon-containing compounds of the metals aluminium, chromium, serium, zirconium, antimony or mixtures of these compounds and, if desired, further carbon-containing compounds of the empirical formula (CH2O)n, in which n is from 1 to 6 for one monomer unit, to the substrate particles and then thermally decomposing the carbon-containing compounds on the surface of the substrate particles under oxygen-excluding conditions.
