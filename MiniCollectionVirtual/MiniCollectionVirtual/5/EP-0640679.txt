<ABSTRACT>
A partial oxidation process and a novel burner are 
provided for simultaneously introducing two or three separate 

feedstreams into a free-flow partial oxidation gas generator 
for the production of synthesis gas and fuel gas, or reducing 

gas. The reactant feedstreams include a liquid 
hydrocarbonaceous fuel or a pumpable slurry of solid 

carbonaceous fuel, and a free-oxygen containing gas e.g. air 
or oxygen. The burner comprises a central conduit and a 

plurality of spaced concentric coaxial conduits with down-flowing 
annular passages. A flat annular-shaped disc or cup-shaped 

porous ceramic or porous metal cooling means of uniform 

composition, wall thickness and porosity with the various 
pores interconnecting is attached to the downstream tip of the 

burner. A controlled amount of liquid coolant under pressure 
is passed successively through the porous inside surface, 

porous core and porous outside surface of the cooling means is 
vaporized. The tip of the burner is thereby cooled. Stress 

cracking of the burner tip is prevented; and the life of the 
burner is extended. Further, deposition of ash on the face of 

the burner is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved process and
burner for the manufacture of gaseous mixtures comprising H2
and CO, e.g. synthesis gas, fuel gas, and reducing gas by the
partial oxidation of gaseous hydrocarbons, liquid
hydrocarbonaceous fuels, or pumpable slurries of solid
carbonaceous fuels in a liquid carrier.Annular-type burners have been employed for
introducing feedstreams into a partial oxidation gas
generator. For example, a single annulus burner is shown in
coassigned U.S. Patent No. 3,528,930, and double annulus
burners are shown in coassigned U.S. Patent Nos. 3,758,037 and
3,847,564, and a triple annulus burner has been shown in
coassigned U.S. Patent Nos. 4,443,230 and 4,525,175. Cooling
the surface of a burner by conductive heat transfer by a
transpiration gas is the subject of U.S. Patent No. 4,775,314.A burner is used to simultaneously introduce the
various feedstreams into the partial oxidation gas generator,
also referred to herein as the gasifier. Recirculating gases
that contact the outside surfaces of the burner are at a
temperature in the range of 927째C to 1927째C (1700째F to 3500째F). Burners
are commonly cooled to withstand said temperatures by means of
cooling channels through which a liquid coolant is passed.
One type of channels are coils wrapped around the external
diameter of the burner along its length. An annular shaped
cooling chamber provides additional cooling at the burner
face. Because of the hot corrosive environment in a synthesis
gas generator, thermal stress cracks develop in the metal at
the tip of the burner. Also, ash deposits on the face of the
burner. These problems and others are avoided by the subject
improved burner design.An improved partial oxidation process and down 
flowing burner are provided for simultaneously introducing two
or three separate reactant feedstreams into a free-flow
partial oxidation gas generator for the production of
synthesis gas, fuel gas, or reducing gas. The separate
feedstreams comprise either (1), (2), and (3) for a three
stream burner; or alternatively (2) and (3) for a two stream
burner, wherein: (1) is a stream of gaseous material
comprising free-oxygen containing gas optionally in admixture
with a temperature moderator such as H2O, or a hydrocarbon gas
or a portion of recycle product gas optionally in admixture
with a temperature moderator such as H2O; (2) is a stream of
liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuel optionally in admixture with a
temperature moderator, or a pumpable slurry stream of solid
carbonaceous fuel in liquid phase
