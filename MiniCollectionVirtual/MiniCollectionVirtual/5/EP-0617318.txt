<ABSTRACT>
An electronic printing method which comprises 
subjecting a radiation sensitive silver halide emulsion 

layer of a recording element to actinic radiation of at 
least 10-4 ergs/cm² for up to 100 microseconds duration 

in a pixel-by-pixel mode is disclosed. The radiation 
sensitive silver halide emulsion layer contains a 

silver halide grain population comprising at least 50 
mole percent chloride, based on silver, forming the 

grain population projected area. At least 50 percent 

of the grain population projected area is accounted for 
by tabular grains that are bounded by {100} major faces 

having adjacent edge ratios of less than 10, each 
having an aspect ratio of at least 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of
electronic printing wherein information is recorded in
a pixel-by-pixel mode in a radiation sensitive silver
halide emulsion layer.The following patents and publications have
some relevance to one or more aspects of the invention:
Hioki U.S. Patent 5,126,235;European Patent Application 479 167 A1;European Patent Application 502 508 A1;Hunt, The Reproduction of Colour, Fourth
Edition, pages 306-307, (1987);Wey U.S. Patent 4,399,215;Wey et al U.S. Patent 4,414,306;Maskasky U.S. Patent 4,400,463 (hereinafter
designated Maskasky I);Maskasky U.S. Patent 4,713,323 (hereinafter
designated Maskasky II);King et al U.S. Patent 4,942,120;Tufano et al U.S. Patent 4,804,621;Takada et al U.S. Patent 4,783,398;Nishikawa et al U.S. Patent 4,952,491;Ishiguro et al U.S. Patent 4,983,508;Bogg U.S. Patent 4,063,951;Mignot U.S. Patent 4,386,156; andEndo and Okaji, "An Empirical Rule to Modify
the Habit or Silver Chloride to form Tabular Grains in
an Emulsion", The Journal of Photographic Science, Vol.
36, pp. 182-188, 1988.Silver halide emulsions having high chloride
contents, i.e., greater than 50 mole percent chloride
based on silver, are known to be very desirable in
image-forming systems due to the high solubility of
silver chloride which permits short processing times
and provides less environmentally polluting effluents.
Unfortunately, it is very difficult to provide a high 
chloride silver halide emulsion having the high sensitivity
desired in many image-forming processes.
Furthermore, conventional emulsions having high chloride
contents exhibit significant losses in sensitivity
when they are subjected to high energy, short duration
exposures of the type used in electronic printing methods
of the type described previously herein. Such
sensitivity losses are typically referred to as high
intensity reciprocity failure.It is known that certain tabular grain silver
halide emulsions can offer a number of photographic
advantages. Thus, during the 1980's a marked advance
took place in silver halide photography based on the
discovery that a wide range of photographic advantages,
such as improved speed-granularity relationships,
increased covering power both on an absolute basis and
as a function of binder hardening, more rapid developability,
increased thermal stability, increased separation
of native and spectral sensitization imparted
imaging speeds and improved image sharpness in both
mono- and multi-emulsion layer formats, could be
achieved by employing tabular grain emulsions.
