<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method for purifying metal ion-containing 
bath liquids used for metal surface cleaning. The 

method comprises circulating two kinds of bath liquids (11A, 
11B) through a plurality of electrolytic cells (1), each 

composed of an anode (2) and a cathode (4) separated by two 
ion-selective permeable diaphragms (6, 7), in such a way as to 

introduce the bath liquid into the intermediate compartment 
(8), electrophoresing metal ions contained in the bath liquids 

(11A, 11B) into the cathode compartment (5) of each 
electrolytic cell (1), simultaneously circulating the 

catholyte (14) through the cathode compartment (5) of the 
electrolytic cell (1), thereby forming and coagulating easily 

magnetizable metal particles and hardly magnetizable metal 
particles in the catholyte (14), and separating the 

coagulation using a magnetic separator (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method 
for purifying bath liquids used for metal surface cleaning by 
separation of dissolved metal cations therefrom. The present inventors had disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Laid-open Nos. 304393/1992 and 354890/1992 a method for 
purifying a bath liquid by electrolysis. This method employs 
an electrolytic cell provided with an ion-selective diaphragm 
between the anode and cathodes. According to this method, a 
bath liquid used for metal surface cleaning is supplied to the 
compartment between the anode and diaphragm (referred to as 
the anode compartment hereinafter). The bath liquid undergoes 
electrolysis such that metal cations contained therein migrate 
toward the cathode through the diaphragm by electrophoresis. 
Thus, metal cations are separated and collected in the cathode 
compartment, and finally they are removed by some means. This 
method would be of great industrial use if the catholyte to be 
circulated through the cathode compartment is controlled such 
that separated metal ions are converted into an easy-to-use 
form. In connection with the foregoing method, the present 
inventors proposed a method for disposing of waste which 
occurs when a bath liquid used for metal surface cleaning is  
 
treated, instead of direct discharging, to avoid environmental 
pollution. This method employs an electrolytic cell provided 
with one or two ion-selective permeable diaphragms between the 
anode and cathode. According to this method, a used bath 
liquid is recycled to the anode compartment or the 
intermediate compartment between the diaphragms. It undergoes 
electrolysis such that metal ions migrate toward the cathode 
compartment through the permeable diaphragm by 
electrophoresis. The metal ions are changed into metal 
particles in the cathode compartment. Finally, the metal 
particles are removed by a magnetic separator. This method 
offers the advantage of not only reducing the contaminant in 
the bath liquid but also recycling the metal component from 
the bath liquid. The above-mentioned electrolytic cell used for purifying 
a bath liquid suffers the disadvantage that the metal 
particles formed in the catholyte cannot be removed by a 
magnetic separator unless they are easily magnetized. For 
example, divalent iron ions contained in a bath liquid give rise to 
metal particles, such as triiron tetraoxide, which are easily 
magnetized and removed by a magnetic separator. By contrast, 
trivalent aluminum or chromium ions in a bath liquid do
