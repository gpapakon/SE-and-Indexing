<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing reclosable plastic 
bags or packages includes the step of presoftening the 

complete length of the zipper before it is introduced 
into the space between two plies of plastic sheet 

material, which form the sides of the plastic bag or 
package. The presoftening enables the zipper, which 

may comprise interlocked male and female profiles, to 
be fused together and completely flattened when a seal 

bar clamps thereacross to form a side seal area 
transverse to the zipper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture 
of plastic bags or packages having at least two plies 
of thermoplastic sheeting, both plies having closure 
strips formed or included on their facing inner edges 
so as to form a zipper-like closure for the openings 
of the bags or packages made therefrom. The plies may 
be formed from two separate sheets or from a single 
sheet folded over. The present invention relates to improvements in 
the package-making art and may be practiced, without 
limitation, in the manufacture of thermoplastic bags 
and trays of the kind that may be used for various 
consumer products, but which are particularly useful 
for food products which must be kept in moisture- and 
air-tight packages, free from leakage until opened for 
access to the product contents, which packages are 
then reclosable by zipper means to protect any 
remainder of the product therein. 
Reference is made to US-A-4.709.533. The indicated art is fairly well developed, but 
nevertheless is still susceptible of improvements 
contributing to increased efficiency and cost 
effectiveness. One problem that still exists in the production 
of packages from continuous zipper-equipped sheet 
material is the difficulty in attaining a satisfactory 
sealing of the bag or package against leakage, where 
the zipper and area of film engaged by the zipper 
extends through the side seal areas separating one bag 
or package from the next.  
 The present invention is directed at a method for 
manufacturing plastic bags or packages representing a 
solution to the above-mentioned problem in the prior 
art. In its broadest form, the method comprises the 
step of pre-softening the entire male and female profile 
sections of a zipper as the bag or package is being 
manufactured. The softening is accomplished by 
feeding the profile sections to a bag or package 
making machine from a dispenser having an associated 
guide tube. The dispenser includes an insulated 
enclosure from which a length of the interlocked male 
and female profile sections may be fed to the bag or 
package making machine through the guide tube, which 
is itself heated. Within the insulated enclosure is 
a heat source for pre-heating the profile sections to a 
desired temperature and degree of softness. 
Preferably, the insulated enclosure includes an 
accumulator on which a length of the softened profile 
sections of the zipper may be disposed under little or 
no longitudinal tension immediately prior to being 
pulled through the guide tube. This

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing plastic bags or 
packages wherein a longitudinally extending continuous 

plastic zipper (16) having male and female profiles on 
interior surfaces of the plastic bag or package 

provides a resealable closure between two plies of 
plastic sheet material (14), said plastic sheet plies being 

welded together with transverse seal at preselected 
intervals separated by a distance corresponding to the 

width of the bags or packages (24) being produced to 
thereby provide side seals separating said bags or 

packages, said method comprising the step of: 

providing a continuous plastic zipper having male 
and female profile sections 

and being characterized by the step of: 
pre-heating (48, 32) said continuous plastic zipper to effect 
a presoftening thereof, before 
inserting said continuous plastic zipper while in 
a heated state between said two plies of plastic sheet 

material (14); 
fusing (18) said male profile section of said 
continuous plastic zipper to one of said two plies of 

plastic sheet material; 
fusing (18) said female profile section of said 
continuous plastic zipper to the other of said two 

plies of plastic sheet material; and 
making a transverse crosswise seam (22) across said 
two plies of plastic sheet material and thr
ough said 
presoftened continuous plastic zipper. 
The method in accordance with claim 1 further 
comprising the step of interlocking said male and 

female profile sections of said continuous plastic 
zipper before heating said continuous plastic zipper. 
The method in accordance with claim 1 wherein 
said heating step (48) is accomplished within a heated 

insulated enclosure (36) and further comprising the step of  
 

guiding said heated zipper toward said two plies of 
plastic sheet material. 
The method in accordance with claim 1 wherein 
said plastic sheet material is folded into a generally 

tubular shape to provide said two plies of plastic 
sheet material. 
The method in accordance with claim 4 further 
comprising the step of guiding said continuous plastic 

zipper while in a heated state between the two edges 
of said two plies of said plastic sheet material. 
A dispenser (30) for supplying a continuous plastic 
zipper (16) having interlocked male and female profile 

sections in pre-heated and pre-softened state to a 
machine for manufacturing resealable plastic bags or 

packages comprising: 

an enclosure (36); 
a heat source (48) within said enclosure, said heat 
source heating and pre-softening said continuous 

plastic zipper; and 
a heated guide tube (32) leading from said enclosure 
toward said machine for manufacturing resealable 

plastic bags or packages, said heated guide tube being 
a conduit for said continuous plastic zipper from said 

enclosure to said machine, said machine pulling said 
continuous plastic zipper through said heated guide 

tube as plastic bags or packages are manufactured 
thereby. 
The dispenser in accordance with claim 6 further 
comprising a thermostat (50), said thermostat being 

operatively connected to said heat source (48), so that the 
temperature within said enclosure may be regulated. 
The dispenser in accordance with claim 6 wherein 
said enclosure is insulated (36). 
The dispenser in accordance with claim 6 further 
comprising:  

 

an axle (38) mounted in a substantially horizontal 
orientation within said enclosure, said axle being 

adapted to hold a coil (40) of said continuous plastic 
zipper (16) thereon; 
a motor (42) operatively connected to said axle and 
operable to rotate said axle so as to unwind a length 

of said continuous plastic zipper from said coil; and 
means (46) for sensing the presence of a length of 
continuous plastic zipper on said accumulator, said 

means being operatively connected to said motor, so 
that said motor may be operated to unwind a length of 

continuous plastic zipper from said coil onto said 
accumulator when said accumulator is empty. 
A dispenser in accordance with claim 6 further 
comprising an accumulator (44) mounted within said 

enclosure, said accumulator being adapted to hold a 
length of said continuous plastic zipper.
