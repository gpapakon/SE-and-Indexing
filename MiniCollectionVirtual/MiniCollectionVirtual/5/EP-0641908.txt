<ABSTRACT>
In a cable lock, particularly for two-wheel vehicles, comprising a lock part with a lock case and a cylinder lock as well as an elongate flexible cable element, one cable end of which is fastened to the lock part rotatably about the cable axis and the other cable end of which is provided with a locking head for selective insertion into a receiving orifice of the lock part and locking in the receiving orifice by means of the lock, it is proposed that the lock part be provided with a cable sleeve which surrounds one end portion of the cable element in the region of the one cable end fastened rotatably to the lock part and which is mounted on the lock part rotatably about the cable axis, the outer circumference of the cable sleeve merging essentially continuously into the outer circumference of the lock case. A cable lock having a pleasing appearance and easy handling is thereby obtained.

A cable lock, in particular for two-wheel vehicles,
comprising


a lock part (14;114.) with a lock housing (16;116)
and a lock, in particular a cylinder lock (20;120),

inside the lock housing (16;116),
an elongate flexible cable element (12;112), one
cable end of which is secured to the lock part

(14;114) so as to be rotatable about the cable axis
(34;134) and the other cable end of which is

provided with a closing head (22;122) for the
selective insertion in a receiving opening (24;124)

of the lock part and locking in the receiving
opening (24;124) by means of the lock,

characterised in

that the lock part (14;114) is provided with a cable sleeve
(44;144) which embraces one end portion of the cable element

(12;112) in the vicinity of the one cable end rotatably
secured to the lock part (14;114) and which is mounted on

the lock part (14;114) so as to be rotatable about the cable
axis (34;134), wherein the outer periphery of the cable

sleeve (44;144) merges substantially continuously into the
outer periphery of the lock housing (16;116), and in that in

a direction away from the lock housing (16;116) the cable
sleeve (44;144) has a substantially continuously decreasing

outer diameter.
A cable lock according to Claim 1, characterised in

that in the vicinity of its end remote from the lock housing
(16;116) the cable sleeve (44;144) extends gently tapering

towards the cable element. 
A cable lock according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the cable sleeve (44;144) is rotatably

mounted on the lock housing (16;116) and in that one cable
end is rotatably mounted on the lock, in particular a

cylinder lock (20;120).
A cable lock according to Claim 3, characterised in
that the cable sleeve (44;144) is secured to the lock

housing (16;116) by clips.
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the length parallel to the

axis of rotation of the part of the cable sleeve (44;144)
protruding from the lock housing (16;116) is in the range of

0.3 to 1 times, preferably 0.4 to 0.8 times the
corresponding length of the lock housing (16;116).
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the cable sleeve (44) is

curved to follow the path of the cable element in the
unloaded state.
A cable lock according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the cable sleeve (144) is

substantially frustoconical.
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the cable sleeve (44;144) and

the cable element (12;112) are formed by separate parts.
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the cable sleeve (44;144)

embraces the end portion of the cable element (12;112) in a
substantially sealed manner.
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the lock housing (16;116) is

formed in two parts with a plane of separation substantially 
parallel to the axis of the rotation (34;134) of the cable

(12;112) in the lock part (14;114).
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the cable sleeve (44;144) is

provided with radially inwardly resilient locating hooks
(46;146) which engage behind the rim of a circular opening

(48) in the lock housing (14;114).
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that it is provided with a lock

support (50) embracing the lock housing (14) for
mounting on a carrier, in particular on a bicycle frame

(58), and in that for securing the lock housing the lock
support (50) is provided with a passage opening (56) for the

closing head (22) in alignment with the receiving opening
(24).
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the cable element (12) is a

coiled cable.
A cable lock according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that one cable end is mounted

rotatably but axially non-displaceably on a cylinder housing
(160) of the cylinder lock (120), which cylinder housing

(160) has both a receiving opening (124a) with a locking
