<ABSTRACT>
A connector assembly for printed circuit boards 
comprises a first and a second connector part. The first 

connector part has a first housing of insulating material and 
having a bottom and two opposite side walls and with male 

contact elements mounted in the bottom of the housing and 
arranged in rows and columns and having portions projecting 

from the bottom of the housing adapted to be inserted into 
holes of the corresponding printed circuit board. The second 

connector part has a second housing of insulating material 
adapted to be inserted into the first housing with an 

insertion side and with female contact elements mounted in the 
housing and arranged in a corresponding manner in rows and 

columns and having portions projecting from a lower side of 
the housing, which projecting portions can be inserted into 

holes of the corresponding printed circuit board. The second 
connector part comprises at least one ground contact plate 

projecting out of said housing at the insertion side along a 
distance substantially corresponding with the thickness of the 

bottom of the first housing. At least one slot is provided in 
the bottom of the first housing for receiving the ground 

contact plates. The first housing comprises shielding plates 
provided on the side walls and having contact means for 

connection with a corresponding conductor of the corresponding 
printed circuit board and wherein ground contact means each 

project in a slot in the bottom of the housing for contacting 
a ground contact plate of the second housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector assembly for 
printed circuit boards, comprising a first connector part with 
a first housing of insulating material and having a bottom and 
two opposite side walls and with male contact elements mounted 
in the bottom of the housing and arranged in rows and columns 
and having portions projecting form the bottom of the housing, 
which projecting portions can be inserted into holes of the 
corresponding printed circuit boards, and a second connector 
part with a second housing of insulating material and adapted 
to be inserted into the first housing with an insertion side 
and with female contact elements mounted in the housing and 
arranged in a corresponding manner in rows and columns and 
having portions projecting from a lower side of the housing, 
which projection portions can be inserted into holes of the 
corresponding printed circuit board. Such a connector assembly is disclosed for example in 
EP-A-0 446 980. In this known connector assembly the second 
connector part comprises a plurality of outer conductors each 
substantially enclosing in circumferential direction at least 
one female contact element operating as signal contact and 
each contacting the adjacent ground contacts of the 
corresponding signal contact of the first connector part. In 
this manner a correct signal transmission can be obtained also 
at high bit rates of the signals to be transmitted. Further, 
outer conductors can also be provided in this known connector 
assembly for the male contact elements operating as signal 
contacts. Although an optimal signal transmission can be 
realized with this known connector assembly also at high bit 
rates, the construction is less suitable for applications, 
wherein the signal contacts must be very closely spaced one 
from the other. The invention aims to provide a connector assembly of 
the abovementioned type, wherein an optimal signal 
transmission at high bit rates is possible and wherein the 
signal contacts can be closely spaced and the construction can 
be simplified.  
 To this end the connector assembly according to the 
invention is characterized in that the second connector part 
comprises at least one ground contact plate projecting out of 
said housing at the insertion side along a distance 
substantially corresponding with the thickness of the bottom 
of the first housing, in that at least one slot is provided in 
the bottom of the first housing for receiving the ground 
contact plates, wherein said first housing comprises shielding
