<ABSTRACT>
In state-of-the-art proximity switches having small diameter sensors, metallic sleeves are used as housing. Because of heat dissipation problems, such a housing is not appropriate for large sensors. Instead of a metallic sleeve, a thermoconductive massive body (1) is disclosed with a bore (6) having the same inner diameter D as the metallic sleeve which receives an electric connection (3) belonging to the proximity switch and an electric circuit (5). In addition, one side of the bore is enlarged so that a sensor fits therein.

Proximity switch having a cylindrical metal 
housing (1), in the interior (2) of which at a front 

side an electrical terminal (3) is arranged and at the 
other front side a sensor (4) is arranged, having an 

electrical circuit (5) in the space between the 
terminal (3) and the sensor (4) and having a heat-conducting 

connection between the electrical circuit 
(5) and the metal housing (1), characterized in that as 

housing a solid cylinder (1) with an external diameter 
which is constant over its length is provided, which is 

provided with a feed-through opening (6, 7), which is 
partially designed as a bore (6), into which the 

electrical terminal (3) and/or the electrical circuit 
(5) are inserted, and which has a widening at its side 

directed away from the terminal (3), into which 
widening a sensor is inserted which is larger compared 

with the diameter (D) of the bore opening, whereby the 
diameter (D) of the bore opening is kept as small as 

possible to attain good removal of heat of the 
electrical circuit by way of the housing. 
Proximity switch according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the widening is designed as a 

second bore (7) axisymmetrical to the first bore (6). 
Proximity switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that at the end 

having the electrical terminal (3) the solid body (1) 
has an external thread (8) axisymmetrically to the 

first bore (6). 
Proximity switch according to claim 3, 
characterized in that the solid body in the region of 

the electrical terminal (3) is tapered to a sleeve-shaped 
section which supports the external thread (8). 
Proximity switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the proximity 

switch has a switching-state display.  
 
Proximity switch according to one of the 
preceding claims 1-5, characterized in that the 

electrical terminal (3) is designed as light-guiding 
plug insert (3) which transmits the light of a light 

diode (9) in the interior (2) to at least a third bore 
(10) in the solid body (1), through which the light of 

the light diode (9) can be recognized from the outside. 
Proximity switch according to claim 6, 
characterized in that the third bore (10) from the 

interior to the outside is provided in the sleeve-shaped 
section of the solid body (1). 
Proximity switch according to one of claims 1-4, 
characterized in that a cable (3) with an external 

diameter which is smaller compared with D is provided 
as electrical terminal and in that the interior (2) is 

filled with a transparent casting compound (11) by way 
of which the light of a light diode (9) in the interior 

(2) can be transmitted to the surface located between 
the solid body (1) and the cable (3) at the outlet of 

the cable (3).
