<ABSTRACT>
In a method of manufacturing and storing a recording 
sheet (25), a coating solution is coated on at least one surface 

of a base member (25-1) and dried and a resulting recording sheet 
is cut and enclosed in a packaging material. The process 

from drying to enclosing is carried out in an atmosphere 
having a humidity not exceeding 50 %RH.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing and
storing a recording sheet according to claim 1, to a recording
sheet according to claim 16 and to an ink jet recording method
according to claim 17.From the document EP-A-0 452 102 a generic process for
manufacturing and storing a packaged silver halide photographic
material is known. The drying step of the process is partly
effected in an atmosphere in which the relative humidity does
not exceed 50 %RH so as to improve the storing stability of the
antistatic property of the light-sensitive material. The
following steps, such as cutting the sheet members as well as
enclosing and sealing the cut sheets in a packaging material,
are performed in an environment having a dew point of not
higher than 16°C in order to maintain the antistatic property.Furthermore, from the document DE-C-3 510 565 an ink jet
recording method is known in which a recording sheet
is used which was at least partly manufactured in an atmosphere in
which relative humidity is not
specified.A recording medium conventionally used in ink jet
recording includes a recording paper composed of a base
layer having a coated layer formed thereon which contains
fine powder silica and a water-soluble binder such as
polyvinyl alcohol as disclosed in Japanese Patent Examined
Publication No. Hei 3-26665, a glossy paper composed of a
cast coated paper having a film formed thereon which
contains polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of
saponification of 50 - 90 mol% and a bridging agent as
disclosed in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. Hei
3-25352, and further a recording sheet for use with an 
overhead projector (OHP) composed of a polyester film
having a hydrophilic film composed of water-soluble
polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of saponification of 70 -
90 mol% as disclosed in Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. Sho 60-220750.Recently, with the improvements in ink jet recording
apparatuses such as an increase in recording speed and
multi-color printing, an ink jet recording
medium is required to provide higher and wider
characteristics. That is, the following characteristics
are required to be simultaneously satisfied:
(1) higher ink absorbing capability (larger absorbing
capacity and shorter absorbing time);(2) capability of formed dots to have higher optical
density and the periphery of the dots not to become
obscure;(3) capability of formed dots to have a shape
approximating a perfect circle with a smooth periphery;(4) capability of image characteristics to be less
changed
