<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a supporting and reconsolidating device for an arrangement on ground-working appliances, with a roller (1) rotatably mounted in a receiving frame. Such a device is to be suitable for uniformly reconsolidating the ground and for preventing clogs of earth from sticking to one another. Seed furrows are to be made at the same time. This is achieved in that there are arranged on the roller (1) in the axial direction, at a desired distance from one another, rings (4) which form webs (3) and over the tops of which is laid a flexible band (5) which, in the non-loaded state, forms an enveloping cylinder (6).
