<ABSTRACT>
A swing arm bracket assembly (112) for automated machinery is disclosed 
including a shaft (130) having a plurality of journals. Each 

journal of the shaft has a bearing (152, 160, 168) thereon and is of 
approximately the same axial length as the bearing. A support member 

is provided which connects on one end to a machine and on the other 
end to the motor. The support member also rotatably engages at least 

one of the bearings on the shaft. A swing arm (126) is provided having 
an arm portion (144) and a cylindrical sleeve portion (146) extending 

axially through the support member. The cylindrical sleeve portion (146) 
rotatably engages at least one of the bearings on the shaft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to swing arm bracket assemblies for automated
letter sorting machines.Fig. 1 shows a conventional swing arm bracket assembly 10 as installed
in a letter sorting machine, The swing arm bracket assembly includes
bracket 12, swing arm 14, and top plate 16. Shaft 18 extends through
the swing arm bracket assembly and is coupled at one end to servo
motor 20 by keyed coupling 22. Shaft 18, on its other end, and idler
shaft support 24 on swing arm 14 have compound pulleys 28 attached
thereto on which rubber belts 30 are driven. Idler shaft support 24 is
positioned on swing arm 14 by belt adjustment bolt 26. In operation,
independently rotatable swing arm 14 is tensioned against a letter
stack to create friction between the rubber belts and the letters. This
tension is provided by helical extension spring 32 which attaches to
spring post 34 on the swing arm bracket assembly.Fig. 2 shows a top view of the conventional swing arm bracket assembly.
Top plate 16 is attached to bracket 12 by socket screws 36. Additionally,
to insure true alignment of the top plate and bracket, hardened
straight pins 38 are provided. Mounting holes 40 are provided in
bracket 12 for attachment of the servo motor to the bottom thereof.
Swing arm 14 has oblong holes 42 and through holes 44 for attachment
and positioning, respectively, of idler shaft support 24 (shown in Fig.
1).Fig. 3 is a partial side sectional view of the swing arm bracket assembly
of Fig. 2 taken along line 3-3. Shaft 18 includes lesser diameter
portion 46 and greater diameter portion 48. Collar 50 is provided
around the lesser diameter portion of the shaft where the shaft extends
through top plate 16. Below collar 50 is bearing 52 which is press fit
onto lesser diameter portion 46 of shaft 18 and is positioned in bearing
bore 54 of top plate 16. This bearing is typically General Bearing Part
No. 6201-2RS.Swing arm 14 includes arm portion 58 and cylindrical sleeve portion 60.
A first sleeve 56 is provided below bearing 52 to locate bearing 52 on
the bearing journal of shaft 18. Within cylindrical sleeve portion 60 are 
two bearings 64 which are also press fit onto lesser diameter portion
46 of shaft 18 and whose axial movement is restrained by retaining
rings 66. These bearings are typically General Bearing Part No. 6001-2RS.
A second sleeve 68 is positioned below bearings 64 followed by
bearing 70, which is identical to bearings 64, also press fit onto shaft
18.The recommended shaft fillet radius for bearings 64 and 70 as specified
by the

<CLAIMS>
A swing arm bracket assembly (112) for an automated letter
sorting machine, comprising a shaft (130) provided with portions of differing

diameters forming a plurality of journals with a plurality of roller
bearings (152, 160, 168) thereon, said shaft being adapted on one end to

connect to a drive shaft of a motor and on the other end to connect to
pulleys;


a support member including a bracket (114) adapted on one end to
connect to the motor and comprising a bearing bore (166), said bearing

bore housing at least one (168) of said bearings on said shaft (130),
said support member further including a top plate (110) attached to the

other end of the bracket and adapted to connect to the machine;
and a swing arm (126) axially located between the bearing bore and
the top plate, said swing arm having an arm (144) for supporting pulleys

and a cylindrical sleeve (146),
characterized in that said cylindrical sleeve extends axially through
said top plate and houses any of said bearings other than that or those

housed within the bracket and in that each of said plurality of journals
of said shaft (130) has an associated shoulder for axial location of the

bearing thereon.
The swing arm bracket assembly of claim 1, wherein said portions
of differing diameters are formed by sections (132, 134, 136, 138,

140, 142) of shaft (130), those portions of larger diameter providing a
shoulder of sufficient radial height for seating said bearings (152, 160,

168).
The swing arm bracket assembly of claim 1, further comprising
means for applying a preload to each of said plurality of bearings.
The swing arm bracket assembly of claim 3, wherein said
means for applying a preload is a spring washer (164).
The swing arm bracket assembly of claim 1, further comprising
means for axially spacing said swing arm (126) from said support member. 
The swing arm bracket assembly of claim 5, wherein said
means for spacing is a thrust washer (156).
The swing arm bracket assembly of claim 1, wherein said
cylindrical sleeve (146) rotatably engages at least one of said bearings

on said shaft (130) at each end of said cylindrical sleeve (146).
