<ABSTRACT>
A multiconnector 
for game machine, 

adapted to send out data 
from a plurality of input 

units to a game machine 
body. The multiconnector 

is provided with a 
plurality of input 

connecting elements 
(32a-32d) having input 

units (20) joined thereto, 
and adapted to receive 

data from the input 
units (20), an output 

connecting element 
joined to a game machine 

body (10) and adapted 
to output data there
to, 
and a controller adapted 

to sequentially read the 
data from the input units 

(20) joined to the input 
connecting elements 

(32a-32d), and output 
the resultant data from 

the output connecting 
element (20) to the game 

machine body (10). This 
enables more input units 

(20) than can be joined 
directly to the game 

machine body (10) to 
be joined thereto at once 

without increasing a data 
processing load on the 

game machine body (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-connection
device for use in a game apparatus for transmitting data
from a plurality of input means to a main body of the game
apparatus.Years have passed since home video game devices
appeared, and recently a wide variety of amusing games has
been developed. The video games are very popular as an
entertainment. Such home video game apparatus usually has
two input means directly connected to its main body.Consequently in the case of game software played
concurrently by three or more game players, the players
operate two input means in turn in accordance with
instructions of the game software. But such a manner of
use is applicable only to games of types such as
simulation games, etc. This has been a problem.For game software, such as action games, shooting
games, etc., which require players to operate input means
in real time, adaptors with a plurality of connection
terminals to be connected to the input means have been
developed. The input means are connected to the
respective plural connection terminals, and the adaptor is
connected to a connection terminal for the input means of
a game apparatus body or a game console. The use of the
adaptor allows players to simultaneously operate a
plurality of input means to enhance a game.However in this conventional adaptor, control of the
plural input means connected to the adaptor, such as
monitoring of the connection states of the input means, 
reading of data from the input means, etc., is conducted
by the game console. Consequently the control of the
input means and the processing of input data by the game
console are complicated, and are not applicable to games
which require high-speed data processing.An object of the present invention is to provide a
multi-connection device which can supply data from a
plurality of input means to a body of a game apparatus
with the game console less loaded with data processing.Other ways of connecting a plurality of input means
to a game console are known. JP-A-2182281 discloses a
control data transmitting adapter for transmitting data in
a wireless state
forming a multi-connection device
as described in the preamble of claim 1. EP-A-0485227 discloses a communication
adaptor for transmitting and receiving data between a
plurality of game sets.The invention provides a multi-connection device for
use in a game apparatus comprising: a plurality of input
connectors for connection to respective input means; an
output connector for connection to a body of the game
apparatus for

<CLAIMS>
A multi-connection device (30) for use in a game
apparatus comprising:


a plurality of input connectors (32) for connection
to respective input means (20) ;
an output connector for connection to a body of the
game apparatus (10) for outputting data to the game

apparatus body (10); and

   CHARACTERIZED BY a control unit (36) for
sequentially reading data from input means (20) connected

to the plural input connectors (32) and outputting the
read data to the game apparatus body (10) via the output

connector;

   wherein, the control unit (36) includes a storage
unit (36c) for storing the sequentially read data from the

plural input means (20), and outputs via the output
connector, in response to an instruction of the game

apparatus (10), the sequentially read data from the plural
input means stored by the storage unit (36c).
A multi-connection device (30) for use in a
game apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising:


a selection means (34) having an individual
selection state that is selective of one of the plural

input connectors;
wherein, when the individual selection state is
selected, the control unit (36) connects the input

connector (32) selected by the selection means (34) to the
output connector.
A multi-connection device for use in a game
device according to claim 2, wherein: 


the selection means (34) has a multi-selection state
which is selective of the plurality of input connections;

and
when the multi-selection state is selected, the
control unit (36) outputs via the output connector, in

response to an instruction of the game apparatus (10), the
sequentially read data from the plural input means (20)

stored by the storage unit (36c).
