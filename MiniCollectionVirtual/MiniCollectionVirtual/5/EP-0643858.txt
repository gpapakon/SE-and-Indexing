<ABSTRACT>
A secure computer controlling access to internal devices via an integrated card reader. A microprocessor-controlled card reader interface logically connected to the CPU of the computer reads and writes information from and to a card placed in the card reader and performs additional functions in response to commands received from the CPU. The boot ROM of the computer is programmed to start execution from a program logic device which runs a verification program to verify the authenticity of a user. Upon a valid user card being placed in the card reader, one or more questions are read from the card and displayed to the user. The user's responses are saved and compared to the correct answers stored on the card, and if the responses match the correct answers, a power control circuit is used by the CPU to turn on power to computer peripherals the user has been authorized to use.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTECTING PROGRAMS AND DATA WITH CARD READERField of the Invention The present invention pertains generally to integrated circuit (IC) information card systems, and more particularly to a microprocessor-controlled card reader interface for controlling user access to the components of a secure computer.Background of the Invention The power and flexibility of personal computers has seen a tremendous growth in their use in all areas of our society, including applications where the data is sensitive in nature. Traditionally, these applications have been found within agencies of the federal government, but the highly competitive marketplace has made such information as marketing, financial, and business plans equally as sensitive to companies who compete against each other in the commercial sector as well. In the early years of the industry when computers were large mainframes, it was relatively easy to control access to them simply by controlling physical access to the room they were contained in. Since modern personal computers are much smaller and may in fact be designed to be carried with a user, it is much more difficult to prevent unauthorized access while still maintaining the advantage of portability.While it is possible through a software program running on the computer to require a user to enter a password or other verification code, this method is not robust in that a password may be guessed, or the software program may be bypassed by commercially available software development tools. Other security methods involving various hardware devices or keys have been proposed and implemented, but they too suffer from the disadvantage that a sufficiently knowledgeable and persistent user may gain unauthorized access to data by tapping into the computer's operating system with specially designed software programs. For applications 

with particularly sensitive data, it may also be desirable to provide a way to physically and logically destroy the data before it becomes compromised.Therefore, there is a need to have a convenient way to prevent the unauthorized use of a computer system which is not subject to bypass while still maintaining the portability and flexibility of the computer system. There is an additional need to provide a way to authorize users to use the computer system. There is a further need to physically and logically destroy data in response to unauthorized attempts by a user to violate the physical or logical integrity of the computer syste .Summary of the Invention The present invention

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED;
1. A secure computer providing for the controlled access of internal devices via an integrated card reader, the computer comprising: a user input device; an integrated card reader; a screen display; a central processing unit (CPU) ; a program logic device (PLD) containing non- volatile CPU program code; a CPU s F- .em boot from the PLD; a plurality of peripheral devices; a system data bus; a microprocessor for writing and reading information to and from a card placed in the card reader; a second data bus logically connected between the microprocessor and the CPU and separate from the system data bus; and a power control circuit logically connected between the CPU and each of the plurality of peripheral devices for selectively controlling power to each of the plurality of peripheral devices in response to information read from the card.
2. A secure computer providing for the controlled access of internal devices via an integrated card reader, the computer comprising: a user input device; an integrated card reader; a screen display; a central processing unit (CPU); a program logic device (PLD) containing non¬ volatile CPU program code; a CPU system boot from the PLD; a plurality of peripheral devices; a system data bus; 


 a microprocessor for writing and reading information to and from a card placed in the card reader; a second data bus logically connected between the microprocessor and the CPU and separate from the system data bus; a power control circuit logically connected between the CPU and each of the plurality of peripheral devices for selectively controlling power to each of the plurality of peripheral devices in response to information read from the card; and means operative to cause said CPU to perform the step of: waiting for a valid card to be placed in the card reader by the user; reading at least one question from a list of questions stored on the card, displaying the question to the user on the screen display, and waiting for a response from the user on the input device; comparing at least one user response to a list of correct answers stored on the card; and allowing access to the computer if at least one user response matches a corresponding correct answer.
3. The computer of claim 2 wherein the CPU performs the additional step of incrementing the value of a retry counter if the user incorrectly answers a question, and waiting for a subsequent user response if the value of the retry counter is less than a predetermined value, otherwise rebooting the computer.
4. A secure computer providing for the controlled access of internal devices via an integrated card reader, the computer comprising: a user input device; an integrated card reader; a screen display;
