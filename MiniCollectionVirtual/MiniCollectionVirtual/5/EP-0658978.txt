<ABSTRACT>
A magnetostatic wave device 10 includes a dielectric 
substrate 12. Micro strip lines as transducers are formed by 

forming an earth electrode 14 and strip-line electrodes 16, 
18 on both surfaces of the dielectric substrate 12. A 

ferrimagnetic base material 20 formed with a GGG substrate 
and a YIG thin film on the GGG substrate is arranged on the 

strip-line electrodes 16 and 18. The ferrimagnetic base 
material 20 is formed so that the end portions slant from 

the strip-line electrodes 16, 18 outwardly. The length of 
the ferrimagnetic base material 20 is established in a 

minimum value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetostatic wave
device, and particularly to a magnetostatic wave device
which is used as a filter or the like.Fig. 7 is an illustrative view showing an example of a
conventional magnetostatic wave device as in for example shown in JP-A-2 224 404 or JP-A-63 132 503. A magnetostatic wave
device 1 includes a dielectric substrate 1. As shown in
Fig. 8, an earth electrode 3 and strip-line electrodes 4
are formed respectively on both surfaces of the dielectric
substrate 2. Micro strip lines as transducers are made with
the earth electrode 3 and the strip-line electrodes 4. One
ends of two strip-line electrodes 4 are connected to the
earth electrode 3 via an end face of the dielectric
substrate 2. Other ends of the strip-line electrodes 4 are
used respectively as an input terminal and an output
terminal. A ferrimagnetic base material 5 is arranged on the
strip-line electrodes 4. The ferrimagnetic base material 5
is made of a GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet) substrates 6 and 
a YIG (yttrium iron garnet) thin film 7 formed on the GGG
substrate 6. The ferrimagnetic base material 5 is arranged
so that the YIG thin film 7 is placed at the side of the
strip-line electrodes 4.When the magnetostatic wave device 1 is used, a
magnetic field is supplied to the ferrimagnetic base
material 5, and a signal is supplied to the strip-line
electrode 4 which is used as an input side. A magnetostatic
wave is excited by the input signal, and the magnetostatic
wave is propagated on the YIG thin film 7. By receiving the
propagated magnetostatic wave, an output signal is obtained
from the strip-line electrode 4 which is used as an output
side. The magnetostatic wave device 1 has a band-pass
characteristics as shown in Fig. 9.However, the conventional magnetostatic wave device is
large, and can not satisfy the needs of miniaturization.
Since the magnetostatic wave device is large, the material
of the ferrimagnetic base material and the like is used in
large quantities, and resulting in high manufacturing cost. It is the object of the present invention to provide a
magnetostatic wave device which is minuaturized, and has low
manufacturing costs.This object is achieved by a magnetostatic wave device
according to claim 1. The magnetostatic wave returned at an end of the
ferrimagnetic base material is attenuated by slanting the
ends of the ferrimagnetic base material against the
transducers, or by putting a magnetostatic wave absorbers at
the ferrimagnetic base material portions out of the
transducers.
