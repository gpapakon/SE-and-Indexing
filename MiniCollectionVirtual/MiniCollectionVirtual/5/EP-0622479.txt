<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to a monofilament made 
from a blend of a polyester having a polyhydric alcohol of 1,4-cyclohexa
ne-dimethanol, 
and a polyamide. Additionally, the blend 

may include a polyolefin. This blend is useful as an article of 
paper making machine clothing used in forming, pressing, or 

drying sections of a paper making machine when the blend is in 
the form of a fiber structure. The blends usefulness stems from 

its dry-heat strength and hydrolysis resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a monofilament made
from a blend of a polyester having a polyhydric alcohol component
of 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol, and a polyamide. This invention is
particularly useful as an article of paper making machine
clothing used in the forming, pressing, or drying sections of a
paper making machine when the blend is in the form of a fiber
structure.Paper is composed of cellulosic fibers that are formed into
a sheet. A paper making machine consists of three main sections:
the forming section, the pressing section, and the drying
section.In the forming section, the cellulosic pulp slurry or
furnish is injected onto a forming fabric which is a long, woven
mesh belt. As the forming fabric moves along through the forming
section, some of the water in the slurry drains through the 
fabric and a paper web is formed. As this paper web leaves the
forming section, it is composed of about 80% water and about 20%
solids. For many years, forming fabrics were woven from metal
wires and had a life of about one week on a paper machine. This
short life was due to metal fatigue and abrasion caused by
contacting the machine parts in the forming section. In the
1960's, experiments were begun to replace the metal fabrics with
woven, synthetic, monofilament yarn fabrics. Today, polyester
monofilament is the yarn of choice for this application and
typical fabric life is about 60-120 days.After leaving the forming section, the paper web moves into
the pressing section where a high compressive force is exerted by
a pair of press rolls to remove more water from the paper web.
The press fabric serves as cushioning and water removing media
between the press rolls. As the paper leaves the pressing
section, the paper web contains about 60% water and 40% solids.Traditionally, press fabrics were made of 100% wool due to
its resilience and water absorbency. However, synthetics have
been developed with good resilience that have longer life than
woolen felts. Fabrics of choice today consist of a base fabric,
woven from polyamide monofilaments into which polyamide fibers
have been needlepunched to form a felt. Typically life of press
felts is 30-60 days. The drying section consists of large, steam-heated cylinders
that dry the paper web to a level of about 6% moisture. A dryer
felt or fabric is needed to hold the paper in contact with the
dryer cylinders. Originally, these fabrics were made from
cotton, but as paper making developed, higher speed and
temperature shortened the life of the cotton dryer
