<ABSTRACT>
An artificial head (2) assembly has mounted therewithin a pair of microphones (10) 
each having the plane of its diaphragm (14) parallel to the axis (12) of the ear channel (8). 

The cavity (6) of the head (2) is rendered substantially anechoic by inclusion of sound-absorbing 
material (20, 22) therein. The arrangement provides a microphone colouration-free 

polar response for acoustic recording.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sound recording system including an artificial head 
having a channel which communicates at one end with an outer-ear structure and at the other 
end with a cavity within the artificial head, the system also including a microphone mounted 
within the head, which microphone has an acoustically active diaphragm. So-called artificial head recording is described in "An electronic dummy for acoustical 
testing" by E.L. Torich et al., Journal of Audio Engineering Society 16 (4), pp 397-402 1968). 
The head itself generally has simplified structural and external ear features which are 
representative of the mean adult population. The head also has an acoustically matched 
microphone pair mounted in the sides of the head. The philosophy behind artificial-head 
recording is that sound to be recorded by each microphone within the head must first pass 
through the associated ear structure and thus is acoustically "shaped" in a manner analogous 
to the human hearing process. United States Patent No. US-A-5,031,216 discloses an alternative, simpler arrangement 
in which the microphones (said to possess a unilateral pickup effect) are mounted in replicas 
of the outer-ears. The position in which the microphones are mounted is generally that which 
corresponds to the position of the pinna openings in a human head. There exist, however, various shortcomings with these prior art arrangements. Firstly, 
with respect to the latter, the microphones are mounted such that they face outward from the 
head with the microphone surface flush with the opening of the pinna. Such a mounting 
arrangement suffers from problems associated with the intrinsic directionality of the 
microphones themselves. This is because all microphones have differing frequency response 
characteristics for sounds which are incident from different directions. It is generally possible 
to attain a relatively flat frequency response when the sound source is on-axis with respect  
 
to the microphone; but when the sound source is off-axis, say 45° off-axis, then the high-frequency 
sensitivity of the microphone is considerably reduced because the sound pressure 
waves approach obliquely and must therefore diffract around and into the diaphragm cavity 
of the microphone. Shorter wavelengths do not achieve this as efficiently as the longer 
wavelengths. Secondly, in respect of the former, it is possible for sound energy which has passed 
through and entered the ear to be reflected back out therethrough by the walls of the

<CLAIMS>
A sound recording system including an artificial head having a channel which 
communicates at one end with an outer-ear and structure at the other end with a cavity within 

the artificial head, the system also including a microphone mounted within the head and 
which microphone has an acoustically active diaphragm, the system characterised in that: 

   the microphone is mounted adjacent the channel such that the plane of the diaphragm 
is substantially parallel to the axis of the channel; 

   and the cavity includes sound-absorbent material for providing a substantially anechoic 
said cavity. 
A sound recording system according to Claim 1 wherein a portion of a surface of the 
channel opposite the diaphragm is tapered, in a direction from the outer-ear structure to the 

cavity, the taper being away from the microphone such that any sound in this portion tending 
to reflect between the microphone and the said surface of the channel is directed toward the 

cavity. 
A sound recording system according to either of Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the 
sound-absorbent material is arranged to substantially fill the cavity. 
A sound recording system according to Claim 3 wherein the sound-absorbent material 
comprises a plurality of materials each of differing acoustic absorbency and/or reflectance. 
A sound recording system according to either Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the sound-absorbent 
material comprises a plurality of acoustic baffles substantially lining the inside of 

the cavity. 
A sound recording system according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
microphone is mounted within the cavity. 
A sound recording system including: a channel which communicates at one end with 
an outer-ear structure and at the other end with a cavity, the system also including a 

microphone mounted adjacent the channel; which microphone has an acoustically active 
diaphragm arranged such that the plane of the diaphragm is substantially parallel to the axis 

of the channel; the channel having a portion of the surface thereof opposite the diaphragm 
tapered, in a direction from the outer-ear structure to the cavity, the taper being away from 

the microphone such that any sound in this portion tending to reflect between the microphone 
and the said surface of the channel is directed toward the cavity; and wherein the cavity 

includes sound-absorbent material for providing a substantially anechoic said cavity.
