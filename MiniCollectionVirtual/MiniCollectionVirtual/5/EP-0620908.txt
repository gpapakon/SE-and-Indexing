<DESCRIPTION>
 MODULAR COOLERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThe invention relates to heat exchangers; and, more particularly, to a modular cooler comprised of a plurality of interconnected units.Description of the Prior ArtHeat exchangers are well known in the art. Certain types are used to cool oil or transmission fluid in vehicles or the like. Depending on the capacity desired, a dealer in such coolers must store in inventory a number of such cooling capacities. There is thus a need for a cooler wherein various capacities may be attended to using only a single unit which can be coupled to one or more like units.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONIt is an object of this invention to provide an improved cooler for cooling oil or transmission fluid or the like. It is further an object of this invention to provide a cooler comprised of a plurality of interconnected modular units.It is still further an object of this invention to carry out the foregoing object in a leak proof manner with fluid communication between the units.These and other objects of the invention are preferably accomplished by providing a modular cooler having a plurality of units which can be interconnected in a leak proof manner yet providing fluid flow therebetween. The cooler can be an oil or transmission fluid cooler and any suitable number of units may be stacked. Thus, a single unit can be used in conjunction with like units to provide any desired degree of cooling. 

 BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGFig. 1 is an elevational view of a single cooling unit in accordance with the teachings of the invention; Fig. 2 is a view taken along lines 2-2 of Fig. 1; Fig. 3 is a view taken along lines 3-3 of Fig. 2;Figs. 4 and 5 are views taken along lines 4-4 and 5-5 respectively, of Fig. 1;Fig. 6 is an exploded view of the unit of Fig. 1; Fig. 7 is an elevational exploded view of a portion of the unit of Fig. 6;Fig. 8 is an elevational view of a modified seal in accordance with the teachings of the invention; andFig. 9 is an elevational view of a pair of abutting plates having the seal of Fig. 8 sealing the plates.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTReferring now to Fig. 1 of the drawing, a modular cooling unit 10 is shown comprised of an upper plate 11CFig. 3) secured to a lower plate 12 (Fig. 6) by a pair of spaced end walls 13, 14 (Fig. 3). A plurality of cooling plates 15 extend between walls 13, 14, secured thereto in any suitable manner. Each plate 15 terminates in apertured end flanges 16' having a mid portion 16 comprised of spaced

CLAIMS
I Claim:
1. A modular cooler comprised of a plurality of interconnected units, each of said units comprising: 5 an upper plate and a lower plate; a pair of spaced end walls secured to said upper and lower plates; a plurality of spaced cooling plates mounted below said upper plate, above said lower plate and
10 between said end walls and secured thereto, each of said cooling plates having a hollow midbody portion with integral flanges at each end of said midbody portion, with apertures therethrough, said apertures in said flanges being in fluid communication with the interior
15 of said midbody portion; a pair of spaced openings in each of said upper and lower plates, one of said openings being on one side of said upper and lower plates and the other of said openings being on the other side of one of said
20 upper and lower plates, the openings on said one side of said upper plate being aligned with the opening on said one side of said lower plate and with said apertures extending through one side of said flanges, and the opening on the other side of said upper plate being
25 aligned with the opening on the other side of said lower plate and with said apertures extending through the other side of said flanges whereby fluid communication is provided from said one of said openings through said aligned apertures, through said midbody portions and out
30 said other of said openings, one of said units being secured in a fluid-tight manner to another of said units with the lower plate of one of said units abutting against the upper plate of another of said units, and a closure plate closing off the lower plate of said
35 another of said units in a fluid tight manner.
*
2. In the cooler of claim 1 including a threaded — nipple associated with each opening in said upper plate 


 having throughboreε in fluid communication with said openings.
3. In the cooler of claim 1 which said nipples are mounted to a nipple plate secured to said top plate, said nipple plate having a pair of spaced openings aligned with both said openings in said top wall and said throughbore through said nipples.
4. In the cooler of claim 3 wherein said nipple plate is secured to said top plate in a fluid tight manner.
5. In the cooler of claim 4 wherein said nipple plate has a circular groove therein surrounding each opening through said nipple plate with a resilient O- ring disposed in each groove.
6. In the cooler of claim 4 including a rigid cylinder extending through aligned openings in said nipple plate and said top wall, and a resilient annular member on said cylinder filling the space between 
'
 abutting surfaces of said nipple plate and said top plate surrounding said aligned openings.
7. In the cooler of claim 3 wherein said nipple plate is removably secured to said top plate.
8. In the cooler of claim 7 wherein said nipple plate has at least one groove along one edge of the upper surface thereof and at least one groove along another edge of the upper surface thereof generally parallel to said first mentioned groove, said top plate having at least one groove along one edge of the lower surface thereof and at least one groove along another edge of the lower surface thereof generally parallel to said first mentioned groove on said top plate, and a removable bar generally U-shaped in cross section having 


 a back wall and integral spaced side walls terminating in inwardly extending ears, said ears being mounted in said grooves removably securing said nipple plate to said top plate.
9. In the cooler of claim 8 wherein like spaced grooves are provided in the underside of said bottom plate whereby one of said units is removably connected to the other of said units by said removable bars engaging grooves in the lower plate of one of said units and the upper plate of another of said units.
10. In the cooler of claim 9 wherein closure plate is removably connected to the lower plate of said another of said units by like spaced grooves provided in the underside of said closure plate whereby the lower of plate of said another of said units is removably connected to said closure plate by said removable bars engaging grooves in the lower plate of said another of said units and the grooves in the underside of said closure plate.
11. In the cooler of claim 1 wherein said lower plate is secured to said closure plate in a fluid tight manner.
12. In the cooler of claim 11 wherein said lower plate has a circular groove therein on the underside thereof surrounding each opening through said lower plate and said closure plate also has a circular groove aligned with each circular groove in said lower plate with a resilient O-ring disposed in aligned grooves in said lower plate and said closure plate.
13. In a modular cooler comprised of a plurality of interconnected units, each of said units comprising: an upper plate and a lower plate; 


 a pair of spaced end walls secured to said upper and lower plates; a plurality of spaced cooling plates mounted below said upper plate, above said lower plate and between said end walls and secured thereto, each of said cooling plates having a hollow midbody portion with integral flanges at each end of said midbody portion with apertures therethrough, said apertures in said flanges being in fluid communication with the interior of said midbody portion; a pair of spaced openings in each of said upper and lower plates, one of said openings being on one side of said upper and lower plates and the other of said openings being on the other side of one of said upper and lower plates, the opening on said one side of said upper plate being aligned with the opening on said one side of said lower plate and with said apertures extending through one side of said flanges, and the opening on the other side of said upper plate being aligned with the opening on the other side of said lower plate and with said apertures extending through the other side of said flanges whereby fluid communication is provided from said one of said openings through said aligned apertures, through said midbody portions and out said other of said openings.
