<ABSTRACT>
A low-fat, frozen whipped topping having a fat 
content of 8 to 15% and which is free of milk solids and 

phosphate salts is formulated using weight ratios of 
from 1.4 to 2.2 parts chemical emulsifier and 5.0 to 6.0 

parts sodium caseinate per 100 parts fat. A low-fat, 
non-dairy, frozen whipped topping can be prepared 

employing the teachings of this invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a formulation and process 
for producing a low-fat, preferably non-dairy, frozen 
whipped topping which will be freeze-thaw stable and 
which will retain a stable foam structure and texture 
after twenty-one days of refrigerator (40°F [4.4°C]) storage. Compositions and processes for preparing either 
dairy or non-dairy frozen whipped toppings are known in 
the art. U.S. Patent Nos. 3,431,717 to Lorant, 
4,411,926 to Trumbetas et al., 4,251,560, 4,451,452 and 
4,505,943 to Dell et al., and 4,478,867 to Zobel et al. 
relate to such compositions and processes. The 
disclosures of these patents enable the production of 
freeze-thaw stable, frozen whipped toppings which are 
distributed as frozen products, which are thawed prior 
to use, and which can be stored in the refrigerator for 
up to 21 days without textural breakdown. The 
aforementioned prior art patents related to frozen 
whipped toppings wherein the fat content is about 20% or 
more. U.S. Patent No. 5,077,076 to Gonsalves et al. has  
 
disclosed formulations and processes which have enabled 
the production of comparably stable, frozen whipped 
topping having a fat content reduced to 15% or below. 
It has been found, however, that the low-fat formulation 
of the Gonsalves et al. patent is quite sensitive to 
changes in processing conditions with the result being 
that the mix does not consistently whip to the desired 
extent during commercial production and does not provide 
consistent stability in the finished product. This invention enables the production of a frozen 
whipped topping which has a low fat content of from 
about 8% to 15% and has an overrun in excess of 250%, 
which is freeze thaw stable and refrigerator stable for 
up to 21 days, and which easily and consistently whips 
to a high overrun in commercial processing. According to the aforementioned Gonsalves et al. 
patent, it was thought that a combination of non-fat 
milk solids and phosphate salts was necessary for the 
production of a stable, frozen whipped topping having a 
fat content below 20%. To date, commercially-successful, 
low-fat or "light" frozen whipped toppings 
have employed a combination of milk solids and phosphate 
salts. It has now been found that it is possible to 
formulate low-fat frozen whipped toppings in the absence 
of non-fat milk solids and phosphate salts. The 
elimination of these ingredients, in accordance with 
this invention, has an obvious cost advantage and has 
been found to not reduce the frozen or refrigerator 
stabili
