<DESCRIPTION>
The object of this invention is a device for the control and continuous
regulation of the relative speed between the scroll and drum of a
centrifugal extractor used for the separation of a solid from one or
more fluids during the processing of products of various types.There are known in engineering machines called centrifugal extractors,
substantially comprising a scroll fitted inside a rotary drum and in
turn rotating in relation thereto, which bring about inside the drum
the settlement and stratification of the various phases of the product
comprising a solid phase and one or two liquid phases of different
specific weight. During the relative movement between the scroll and
the drum, and because of the presence of the product being processed,
between the facing surfaces of the drum and the scroll there is
generated friction and therefore a resistant torque, which is dependent
upon the quantity of product located between the scroll and the drum,
which quantity is in turn influenced by various parameters, such as the
flow rate of the product being fed; the quality of the product being
processed, which quality is represented in particular by the percentage
of solid and by the specific weight of such solid; the speed of
rotation of the drum and the relative speed between the drum and the
scroll.More specifically, under equal conditions of quantity and quality of
the product being processed such torque is inversely proportional to
the relative speed existing between the scroll and the drum. However, whilst the quantity or flow rate of the product being
processed can be easily regulated via a feed pump, the quality of the
product resulting from processing upstream of the extractor is
difficult to regulate, so that the resistant torque is subject to
variations during operation, even where both the relative speed between
scroll and drum and the feed rate are constant.To this is added the possible occurrence of fortuitous circumstances
which alter the normal operating regime, for example the ingress of
undesirable foreign bodies which, by increasing friction between the
scroll and the drum, may generate peaks of resistant torque between
them.Such variations therefore affect the stresses to which the mechanical
parts of the machine are subjected and the system of transmission of
movement from the motor to the drum and therefore to the scroll.There are also known in engineering devices for the transmission of
movement between the drum and the scroll which are designed according
to a principle of rigid
