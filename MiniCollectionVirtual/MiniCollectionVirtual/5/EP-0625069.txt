<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of manufacturing microcapsules from biodegradable polymers, the method using biodegradable solvents and producing microcapsules which are free from toxic solvent residues. The solvents used include simple esters made from a C1-C5 alcohol and a C1-C5 monocarboxylic acid, as well as mixtures of such esters, and the solvent can also contain a C1-C5 alcohol. Both water-soluble and water-insoluble active substances can be incorporated in the microcapsules. Water-soluble active substances such as drugs, peptides, proteins, enzymes and vaccins are preferably dispersed as an aqueous solution in the polymer solution. The microcapsules are produced by spraying a solution, suspension or water-in-oil dispersion of active substances and biodegradable polymers. The method is suitable for use in the manufacture of drug, vaccin and enzyme preparations.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of microcapsules containing
a biologically active substance and consisting of a

physiologically compatible polymer which is degradable in
the living organism, by


a) preparing a solution of said physiologically compatible
polymer which is degradable in the living organism;
b) introducing the active substance into the solution of
said physiologically compatible polymer which is degradable

in the living organism as prepared in step
a) by


dissolving the active substance in a solvent
miscible with the solvent used in step a) and

mixing the two solutions; or
suspending the active substance in a micronized
state; or
dispersing an aqueous solution of the active
substance in the solution prepared in step a) to

form a w/o dispersion; and
c) spray-drying the solution, suspension or w/o dispersion
obtained in step b);
 
characterized in that at least one C
1
-C
5
-alkyl ester of a
C
1
-C
5
-monocarboxylic acid, optionally in admixture with at
least one C
1
-C
5
-alcohol, is used as the solvent for dissolving
said physiologically compatible polymer which is

degradable in the living organism and said active substance,
if dissolved in a solvent, and said spray-drying

is performed at a temperature of from 40 to 70 °C under
conditions which correspond to a spray flow of 400 to

500 NL/h as set on a Mini Spray Dryer Büchi 190.
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that
ethyl formiate, ethyl acetate or isopropyl acetate is used

as the solvent.
The process according to any of claims 1 or 2, characterized
in that a mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol is

used as the solvent.
The process according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that a medicament, a peptide, a protein, an enzyme

or a vaccine is used as said active substance.
The process according to claim 4, characterized in that
said active substance is prostaglandin E2.
The process according to claim 4, characterized in that
said active substance is 17-β-estradiol.
