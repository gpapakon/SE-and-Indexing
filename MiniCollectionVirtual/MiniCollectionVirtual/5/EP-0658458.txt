<ABSTRACT>
A movable control console (20) for an agricultural tractor 
is disclosed wherein the console (20) is movable independently of 

the operator's seat (15) to position the operative controls (21, 
23, 24, 26) at the convenience of the operator. The orientation 

of the console (20) is controlled by a guide assembly (50) 
supported from the tractor chassis (10). The guide assembly (50) 

is provided with non-linear slots (53, 54) cooperable with guide 
members (56, 57) on the console (20) to rotate the console (20) 

clockwise as it is moved rearwardly to mimic the rotation of the 
operator's seat (15) to an implement operating position. Fore-and-aft 

movement of the console (20) is effected by an electric 
actuator (40) controlled through a switch (45) mounted on the 

console (20). In an alternative embodiment, the console (20) is 
mounted on a pivotable mounting linkage (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to off-road motor vehicles,
such as tractors, and more particularly, to a console, housing
operative controls for the vehicle, that is shiftable to position
the operative controls to a convenient position selectable by the
operator.Tractors, particularly tractors used in an agricultural
environment, are provided with an operator's seat that is
shiftable in a fore-and-aft direction to place the operator at a
comfortable location relative to the steering wheel.
Agricultural tractors are often provided with an operator's seat
that is also rotatable approximately 15° to 30° clockwise to
facilitate the need for the operator to look over his or her
right shoulder to view the operation of an implement being towed
by the tractor behind the operator.Typically, many of the controls for the operation of the
tractor and most of the power-takeoff and hydraulic controls for
controlling the operation of the implement operatively connected
to the tractor and usually positioned rearwardly of the tractor,
are located in a fixed console adjacent the right side of the
operator's seat for convenient manipulation thereof by the
operator, particularly while the operator is operating the towed
implement as well. The positioning of the operator's seat in the
fore-and-aft direction, and particularly the positioning of the
operator's seat to the clockwise rotated position, causes a
positional variance between the fixed console and the movable
seat. The result to the operator is that controls that are
conveniently accessible in one position of the operator's seat
are no longer in the desired positional relationship to the
operator when the seat position is moved to an alternative
position.To attenuate some of the drawbacks mentioned, US-A-4.471.848
proposes to provide a control panel assembly which is pivotally 
connected to a floor panel of an operators station to allow the
control panel to be positioned in an infinite number of
positions. On the control panel, a grip is provided for
facilitating adjustment by the operator whereas close to the
floor panel a locking arrangement is operational to retain the
control panel assembly at a selected location. This arrangement
therefore suffers from the disadvantage that an operator requires
both hands to carry out an adjustment of the control panel to a
desired position and will have difficulty to obtain such a
desired position as a result of the total freedom of movement of
the control panel in whatever direction once the position lock of
the panel has

<CLAIMS>
A vehicle comprising :

a mobile chassis (10);
steering controls (14) supported by said chassis
(10) for controlling the direction of movement of said

mobile chassis over the ground;
a seat (15) supported adjacent said steering
controls (14) for at least fore-and-aft movement relative

thereto; and
a control console (20) supporting a plurality of
operational control devices (21, 23, 24, 26) adjacent said

seat (15); said control console (20) being independently
moveable relative to said seat (15); and

   characterized in that a support assembly (30, 50)
supports said control console (20) on said chassis (10)

allowing said console (20) to move relative to said seat
along a predetermined path.
A vehicle according to claim 1 characterized in
that said seat (15) is rotatable from a vehicle operating

position oriented in a forward direction to an implement
operating position rotated through a predetermined angular

rotation from said vehicle operating position to facilitate
the observation of the operation of an implement towed

behind said vehicle while said vehicle is moving in a
forward direction.
A vehicle according to claims 1 or 2 characterized
in that said control console (20) is movable forwardly and

rearwardly from a median position, the movement thereof
forwardly of said median position is generally in a 

longitudinal direction with minimal transverse movement.
A vehicle according to claim 2 characterized in
that the movement of said control console (20) rearwardly of

said median position results in a transverse rotation of
said control console to correspond to the predetermined

angular rotation of said seat when moving from said tractor
operating position to said implement operating position.
A vehicle according to any of the preceding claims
characterized in that said support assembly (30, 50)

comprises a guide assembly (50) fixed to the chassis (10),
said guide assembly (50) controlling the orientation of said

control console (20) within the range of movement thereof.
A vehicle according to claim 5 characterized in
that said guide assembly (50) includes guide means (51)

cooperable with both the forward and rearward portions of
said control console (20) for orientation of said console

(20) during movement thereof.
A vehicle according to claim 6 characterized in
that said guide means (51) includes a plate (52) having a

forward slot (53) and a rearward slot (54), said control
console (20) being provided with front and rear guide

position, said swing arms (33, 38) are oriented at a
predetermined angular displacement rearwardly from a

transverse orientation, the extent of forward movement of
said control console (20) from said median position being

limited to approximately twice said predetermined angular
displacement so that the overall forward movement of said

control console (20) from said median position does not
result in any substantial transverse movement of said

control console (20).
A vehicle according to claim 14 characterized in
that the movement of said control console (20) rearwardly of

said median position involves a pivotal movement of said
swing arms (33, 38) toward a longitudinal line passing

through the corresponding said pivot axis (32, 37),
