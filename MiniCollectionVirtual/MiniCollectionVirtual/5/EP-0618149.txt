<ABSTRACT>
This device includes a sheet (22) for obturating an opening (16) in the container, made from a composite material comprising a metal sheet (24) coated with a polymer layer (26) which can be heat-sealed to the container, fixed by a weld line (28) to the edge (30) of the opening (16). The edge of the obturating sheet (22) extends beyond the weld line (28) and includes an additional thickness (32) for reinforcing this sheet. Preferably, the additional thickness is formed by a fold (32) in the edge of the obturating sheet (22).

A sealing device for a container, of the type comprising a sheet 
(22) for sealing an opening (16) of the container and made of a 

composite material comprising a metal sheet (24) covered with a 
polymer layer (26) heat-sealable to the container (10), and 

attached by a sealing line (28) to the edge (30) of the opening 
(16), the edge of the sealing sheet (22) extending beyond the 

sealing line (28), characterised in that the whole of the sealing 
sheet (22) is separable from the edge (30) of the opening (16) by 

pulling it away at the sealing line (28), the entire edge of the 
sealing sheet (22) comprising a reinforcing thickening (32) 

preventing the sealing sheet (22) from tearing when a pulling 
force is exerted at the sealing line (28). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
thickening is formed by a fold (32) at the edge of the sealing sheet 

(22), the polymer layer extending on the inside of the fold (32) and 
the metal sheet extending on the outside of the fold (32). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
sealing sheet (22) comprises a pulling tab (34) as a continuation of 

the edge of the said sheet (22).  
 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the sealing sheet (22) comprises an aluminium sheet (24) 

covered with a layer of polyethylene (26). 
A container, characterised in that it comprises a device according 
to any one of the preceding claims. 
A container according to claim 5, characterised in that it is 
manufactured from sheet metal.
