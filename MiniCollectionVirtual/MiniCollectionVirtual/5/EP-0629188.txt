<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing a compound comprising a monocyclic aromatic ring having at least a first substituent and a substituted sulphonyl group at the position para to said first substituent, the process comprising mixing a reactant comprising the monocyclic aromatic ring with said first substituent and hydrogen in the position of the ring para to said first substituent, with a sulphonic acid halide derivative in the presence of a naturally occurring or synthetic zeolite capable of catalysing a sulphonylation reaction between said reactant and said sulphonic acid halide, under conditions in which said reaction will occur.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a regiospecific sulphonylation 
reaction of substituted aromatic compounds. Sulphonylated aromatic compounds are useful intermediates in a wide 
range of fields such as in agrochemicals and polymers (see for example US 
Patent No. 4,780,127). European Patent Application No. 455332 describes 
certain reactions of aromatic compounds in the presence of zeolite 
catalysts. The normal reaction between an aromatic compound and alkyl sulphonyl 
halide in the presence of an aluminium trichloride catalyst gives 
approximately 50% para selectivity. The applicants have provided a process 
whereby the para selectivity of such a reaction is enhanced. According to the present invention there is provided a process for 
preparing a compound comprising a monocylic aromatic ring having at least a 
first substituent and a substituted sulphonyl group at the position para to 
said first substituent, the process comprising mixing a reactant comprising 
the monocyclic aromatic ring with said first substituent and hydrogen in 
the position of the ring para to said first substituent, with a sulphonic 
acid halide derivative in the presence of a naturally occuring or synthetic 
zeolite capable of catalysing a sulphonylation reaction between said 
reactant and said sulphonic acid halide under conditions in which said 
reaction will occur. The monocyclic aromatic ring may be carbocyclic or heterocyclic. 
Examples of such rings include phenyl, or pyridyl or pyridinium, preferably 
phenyl. The said first substituent may be any organic group provided only that 
it is not of sufficient size to preclude reaction in a zeolite catalyst. 
Suitably it is an electron-donating group so as to activate the para-hydrogen 
to electophilic displacement. Examples of such substituents 
include alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, haloalkyl or alkoxy. Suitably the alkyl, 
alkenyl, alkynyl or haloalkyl group have up to twenty carbon atoms, but 
preferably up to 4 carbon atoms. Specific examples of such substituents 
are C₁₋₄ alkyl in particular methyl, iso-propyl or methoxy. Other substituents may be present on the aromatic compound at the 
positions ortho and meta to the first substituent as required. These 
substituents may include for example halo or hydroxy.  
 As used herein the terms "alkyl", "alkenyl" and "alkynyl" refer to 
straight or branched chains having for example up to 20 carbon atoms. The 
term "haloalkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by at least one 
halogen. The term 'aryl' includes phenyl and the term
