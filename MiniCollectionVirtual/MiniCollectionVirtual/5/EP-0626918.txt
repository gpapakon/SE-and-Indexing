<ABSTRACT>
A tunnel jet propulsion unit (11) for marine craft, wherein the passing water mass in the tunnel is converged by decreasing the cross-sectional flow area of the tunnel. The unit (11) comprises an intake section (1); an impeller section comprising a cylindrical housing (31), a rotatable hub (34) and a plurality of radially spaced impeller blades (36); a diffuser section comprising an inwardly tapered inside surface (39), a fixed hub (38) and a plurality of radially spaced diffuser blades (40); a discharge section (D); a bearing between the hubs (34) and (38); and means for rotating the rotatable hub (34). Additional features include an anti-balling by-pass valve (172) positioned upstream from the impeller (33) to relieve excessive water pressure on the hull if unit (11) handling capacity is exceeded and a trim adjusting mechanism in the discharge section (D) for adjusting the height of the unit outlet (30) with respect to the water surface. Also a nozzle (21) having a variable outlet orifice can be used to fine tune performance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a marine tunnel
propeller jet propulsion apparatus, and more particularly
to an impeller assembly and tunnel design for a marine
tunnel propeller jet propulsion unit.The use of jet propulsion devices for marine craft
is well known technology. Jet propulsion has many
advantages over the simple propeller, particularly in
terms of maneuverability, and jet propulsion energy
consumption is much more efficient. However, widespread
acceptance of jet propulsion for marine craft has not
occurred because of certain common problems associated
with marine jet propulsion. For example, marine jet
propulsion poses significant design problems because of
uncertain performance over a wide range of speeds, water
depth, sea conditions, etc.Excess water pickup at the jet propulsion unit inlet
may cause balling, i.e., excess water pressure between
the hull and the inlet because the unit is not able to
intake a sufficient volume of water during craft
maneuvers or poor sea conditions. Balling induces a high
drag characteristic adversely affecting the propulsive
efficiency.Cavitation is another common problem. Cavitation
represents an uneven load on the impeller. Cavitation
can be produced by excessive radial acceleration of the
fluid, excess swirl and turbulence of the fluid column,
and unintentional partial vaporization of the fluid
throughput associated with a vacuum produced by impeller
action.Accordingly, it would be desirable to design a jet
propulsion unit for marine vessels where each feature
synergistically work together to provide for a constant
column of water even at high output and where the water 
throughput is neither turbulent nor swirling in order to
eliminate cavitation effects. Furthermore, the unit
should have maximum flexibility to cope with the entire
speed range of the marine vessel and varying loading on
the unit without producing the above-mentioned balling
and cavitation effects.Finally, the unit ought to be efficient at
preventing intake of foreign matter, yet have provided
therefor a quick means for manually cleaning the intake
if fouling occurs.U. S. Patent 4,449,944 to Baker et al. discloses a
variable inlet device for a hydrojet boat drive
permitting efficient transition from low to high speed
operation of the boat. Installed in the "slot" of a "V"
bottomed hull, the drive features a low drag ram-scoop
with a blow-in door or panel which is responsive to
imbalance between internal flow pressure and external
slipstream pressure.U. S. Patent 3,543,713 to Slade
