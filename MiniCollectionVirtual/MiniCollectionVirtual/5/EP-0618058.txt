<ABSTRACT>
A pressure transducer (10) for an injection molding 
machine includes a housing (24) coupled to a nozzle (12) of an 

injection molding machine. A hollow stress tube (26), 
attached to the housing (24), through which molten material 

of the injection molding machine flows, bellows in 
response to pressure from the material. An outer ring (28) 

having an opening (40) is coupled to the stress tube (26) such 
that the outer ring (28) expands, causing displacement of 

the outer ring (28) about the opening (40), when the stress tube (26) 
bellows. A displacement sensor (42) is included for 

determining the displacement of the outer ring (28) about 
the opening (40). This displacement is directly 

proportional to the pressure of the material. In this 
manner, the pressure transducer (10) determines the 

pressure of the molten material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
pressure transducers and pertains, more particularly, 
to pressure transducers for use with injection molding 
machines. Injection molding machines are used to manufacture 
plastic and metal parts. Injection molding machines 
typically include a reservoir of molten plastic and a 
nozzle through which the molten plastic is forced at 
high pressures into a mold. The plastic is thereafter 
packed and cooled to form the part. In the 
manufacture of such parts, it is important to 
precisely determine the pressure of the injected melt 
to maintain accuracy of the part because the part must 
be made at a consistant pressure. This is so because 
otherwise the resulting part may include voids, 
ripples, poor dimensional accuracy or the like. As such, there is a need for pressure transducer 
devices which can accurately measure the pressure of 
molten plastic within injection molding machines.  
 
Attaining accuracy in pressure measurements by 
injection molding machine pressure transducers is 
difficult because pressures within such injection 
molding machines may be as high as within the range of 
40-50,000 psi and the temperature may be as high as 
approximately 500°C. In other words, such pressure 
transducers must be able to accurately measure and 
withstand pressures within the range of 40-50,000 psi 
and operate accurately within an environment having 
temperatures up to approximately 500°C. Additionally, 
such pressure transducers are faced with the following 
constraints: 1. the pressure transducer must have low 
working stresses to avoid metal fatigue cracking under 
repetative cyclic loading; 2. the pressure transducer, 
for economic practicality must be physically arranged 
such that it can shot chamber/nozzle area easily be 
integrated within injection molding machines; and 3. 
the pressure transducer must not disrupt the plastic 
flow or have pockets where plastic will remain and 
eventually degrade and cause staining of the parts as 
the degraded plastic moves into the flow. Accordingly, a general object of the present 
invention is to provide an injection molding machine 
pressure transducer which can accurately measure 
pressures of molten plastic within such machines. A further object of the present invention is to 
provide an injection molding machine pressure 
transducer which is easily integratable with existing 
injection molding machines.  To accomplish the foregoing and other objects, 
features and advantages of the present invention, 
there is
