<ABSTRACT>
A known hydraulic vehicle braking system has an antilock system and is in addition developed in order to improve the behaviour of the vehicle on the road, in particular when driving in curves, by automatic braking. During automatic braking, pressure is supplied by an auxiliary source instead of the master-cylinder of the brake, and is individually adjustable in the wheel brakes by pressure reduction by means of the antilock system. For that purpose, cylinders with separating pistons are located between the auxiliary source and the antilock system. The disadvantages are that the auxiliary pump requires much driving energy and generates annoying noises. In order to reduce energy consumption and noise level during automatic braking, the auxiliary source supplies substantially lower auxiliary pressures, the auxiliary pressure is supplied to inputs (89, 90) of return pumps (13, 14) through valves (39, 40, 45, 46) and the pressure is temporarily increased up to the level required for automatic braking only by said return pumps (13, 14).
