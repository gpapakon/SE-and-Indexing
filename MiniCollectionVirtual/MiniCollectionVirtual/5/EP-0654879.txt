<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to raceways with a 
cover for electrical cables or the like, and in particular 
raceways with a so-called wrapround cover. In electrical systems the use is known of 
raceways for accommodating electrical cables. These 
raceways commonly consist of a container base for the 
cables, i.e. the actual raceway, which is connected to 
the surface on which the said cables are to be installed, 
and a lid or cover, the object of which is to cover these 
cables, both for protective and aesthetic purposes. Both 
the raceway and the cover are commonly made of plastics 
material which is shaped by extrusion. In order to render these raceways more secure, 
for some time covers have been used, the lateral limbs of 
which completely cover the lateral walls of the raceway. 
For the purpose of connecting the cover stably to the 
raceway, outwardly facing grooves have been provided on 
the lateral walls of the raceway, such as to provide the 
lateral walls with a U-shaped transverse cross-section 
which is inclined towards the open side of the raceway. 
These grooves connect with a fin which is disposed on the 
inner surface of the lateral limbs of the cover, and is 
inclined towards the closing plane of the latter, such as 
to ensure stable closing of the raceway. However, maintenance, repair or replacement of 
the wires disposed inside the raceway may require the 
latter to be opened; in this case, the shape of the 
above-described raceway makes it particularly difficult 
to open without causing some damage or weakening of the 
structure. In fact, this stop fin of the cover co-operates 
with the groove in the base such that the folding  
 
angle of the cover has to be substantially forced in 
order to open the raceway. In order to limit this forcing, 
the idea had been conceived of positioning this fin 
such that it was inserted only in the lower part of the 
raceway; however this arrangement renders the cover less 
stable in its seat, with obvious aesthetic and practical 
disadvantages. In order to eliminate the disadvantages which 
exist in raceways with a cover of the above-described 
type, the object of the present invention is a raceway 
with a wrapround cover which consists of a raceway provided with a base and lateral walls and a 
cover provided with lateral limbs which extend along the entire length of the 
lateral walls of the raceway, the lateral walls of the raceway being provided 
with grooves with a U-shaped transverse cross-section, characterized 
in that the lateral limbs of
