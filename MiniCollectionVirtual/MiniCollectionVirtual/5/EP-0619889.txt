<ABSTRACT>
A variable attenuator (10) for a fiber optic transmission system includes first and second optical fibers (18, 18') which are axially aligned. The fibers are provided with spherical polishes (30, 30'). The radius (R, R') of each of the polishes originates at an axis which is offset from an axis of the fiber cores (20, 20').

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to fiber optic 
attenuators. More particularly, this invention pertains 
to an attenuator which may be continuously varied to 
have an attenuation throughout a range of values. In the prior art, optical attenuators are 
provided to attenuate a light signal passing through 
optical fibers. Examples of optical attenuators are 
shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,557,556 and 4,557,557 as 
well as U.S. Patent No. 4,893,889. Variable attenuators are also known. An 
example of such is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,904,044. 
That patent teaches a continuously variable fiber optic 
attenuator which utilizes a flexible filter of varying 
optical density. Specifically, the present invention relates to an optical attenuator 
having the features set forth in the prambles of Claims 1 and 11, 
which were patterned after FR-A-2 598 820 (which discloses an 
attenuator for providing a variable attenuation) and US-A-4 893 889. 
(which discloses an attenuator for providing a fixed attenuation), respectively. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a variable attenuator for a fiber optic 
transmission system. It is a further object of the 
present invention to provide such an attenuator which is 
of low cost manufacture. A still further object of the 
present invention is to provide a variable attenuator 
which is variable over a wide range of attenuation 
values. According to the 
present invention there is provided an attenuator for a 
fiber optic transmission system, which has the further features set forth in the characterising portions of Claims 1 and 11. The attenuator 
includes a first optical fiber having a first core which 
terminates at a first terminal end. The first terminal 
end has a non-orthogonal surface relative to a first 
axis of the first core. A second optical fiber having a 
second core is provided terminating at a second terminal 
end. An alignment mechanism is provided for aligning  
 
the first terminal end in optically coupled relation to 
the second terminal end for permitting rotation of the 
first fiber about the first axis. Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of an 
attenuator according to the present invention; Fig. 2 is the view of Fig. 1 with one fiber of 
Fig. 1 shown rotated 90°; Fig. 3 is the view of Figs. 1 and 2 showing a 
fiber rotated 180°; Fig. 4 is an enlarged view of a portion of the 
view of Fig. 1; Fig. 5 is an enlarged view of a portion of the
