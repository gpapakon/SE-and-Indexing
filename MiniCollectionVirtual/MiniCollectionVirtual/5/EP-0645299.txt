<ABSTRACT>
The bodywork (body) is formed using profiled aluminium alloy bars, and it comprises a central structure (1) or cage fixed to an indeformable subframe (2). This central structure (1) results from assembling continuous profiled sections arranged so as to form a front panel (5) and a rear panel (6) which are equipped with uprights (M) and crossmembers (T) which are joined together by longitudinal members (L). The profiled bars are joined together using gusset plates and are reinforced by ties (7). The profiled bars constituting the central structure (1) are continuous, and the crosspieces (T), in particular, extend laterally to allow a take-up of loading for the side fittings of the bodywork.

An aluminium alloy car body of the type constituted of profiled 
bars assembled together and of covering panels (43) building a central 

structure (1) in the form of a cage, attached and flanged on a substructure 
(2) substantially dimensionally stable, shaped as a rectangular frame, made 

of steel and connected by elastic means to the side members (3) of the 
chassis, the said cage resulting from an assembly of continuous profiles 

arranged in order to build front (5) and rear (6) panels fitted with posts (M) 
and crosspieces (T), the said panels being united by side members (L). 
A body according to claim 1, characterised in that the central 
structure (1), in the form of a cage, comprises tie beams (7) arrranged in the 

three horizontal, vertical and lateral planes, in order to rigidify the said 
structure. 
A body according to any of the claims 1 or 2, characterised in 
that it comprises high and/or low crosspieces (7), extending laterally on 

either side of the central structure (1), constituting stress recovery means for 
the lateral fixtures forming the said body. 
A body according to any of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that it is made of profiled bars fitted with at least one fastening channel (16) 

whose inside portions, co-operating with assembly stops (14), comprise 
longitudinal thin scores (23). 
A body according to claim 4, characterised in that the stops (14) 
comprise scores (24) arranged in order to be crossed with those of the 

fastening channels (16), when they are in active assembly position. 
A body according to claim 5, characterised in that the stops (14) 
are built from a profiled bar which comprises longitudinal thin scores on one 

of its faces, whereby the said stops are cut into the said bar so that their end  
 

face describes an angle in the order of 60° with the longitudinal axis of the 
said bar. 
A body according to claim 6, characterised in that the stops (14) 
have been handled in order to exhibit a hardness greater than that of the 

profiled bars making up the structure. 
A body according to any of the claims 4 to 7, characterised in 
that the assembly gussets (13) perform automatic centring of the profiled 

bars and in that they are formed with an angle slightly greater than their 
rated angle, in the order of 1 to 5°, in order to exert a kind of pre-stress at the 

connection between the adjacent profiles. 
A body according to any of the claims 4 to 7, characterised in 
that the assembly gussets (13) comprise, in their central part, a reinforcing 

piece (131) in the form of a square, interconnected to the central part (132) 
of the said gusset. 
A body according to any of the claims 4 to 9, characterised in 
that the screws (15) used for fastening the stops (14) comprise at their ends, 

a glue-type coating in order to force the said stops into rotation after being 
installed in the fastening channel (16) and to strengthen the assembly. 
A body according to any of the claims 4 to 10, characterised in 
that the profiled bars comprise, in addition to the fastening channel (16), 

grooves (26), arranged in the lateral flanks (17), the aperture of which is 
oriented towards one another, whereas the said grooves enable all kinds of 

gaskets to be mounted co-operating with equipment and with fixtures 
accommodated in the cavity (26) delineated by the said flanks (17). 
A body according to claim 11, characterised in that the grooves 
(26) have a trapezoidal cross section. 
A body according to any of the claims 4 to 12, characterised in 
that the profiled bars comprise, externally, on their face designed for 

accommodating and for gluing the covering panels (43), a shallow groove 
(46), enabling the placement of a double sided-type self-seal bottom (45),  

 
which defines the thickness of the glue seal (44) and enables to maintain the 

said panel during polymerisation of the said glue seal. 
A body according to claim 13, characterised in that the profiled 
bars comprise, on their external face for accommodating the covering panels 

(43), a scored zone (48) maintaining a finish bead (47) interposed between 
the said profile and the covering panel.
