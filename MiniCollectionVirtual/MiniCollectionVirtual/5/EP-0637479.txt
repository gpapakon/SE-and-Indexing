<ABSTRACT>
The blade (2) rotates about a pivot (3) intermittently with reverse movement prevented by a catch (7) engaging with the teeth on its rim. When the rectangular workpiece (14) has been sheared by the cutting edge (5) of the blade, the latter is returned to its initial position by movement of the hand lever (13). The angle through which the blade rotates is determined by a toothed catch (6) associated with a cylindrical axial bolt (11) in which another bolt (12) is set eccentrically.
