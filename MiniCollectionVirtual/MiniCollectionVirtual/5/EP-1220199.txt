<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to Japanese Patent Application
No. 2000-401362 filed on December 28, 2000, based on which
this application claims priority under the Paris Convention
and the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.The present invention relates to a method for object
voice processing, a program execution device for executing
a voice processing program, a recording medium having
recorded therein a voice processing program, and a voice
processing program; all of which are preferably applicable
to video game machines or entertainment devices having video
game function.In recent years, there are widely popularized video game
machines for executing video games based on game programs
which are stored in storage media such as CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and
semiconductor memory.Such video game machine is designed to allow a player
to manipulate a game object which appears on a display screen
through operating a controller plugged into the main unit of 
the video game machine. Thus, the player can enjoy a variety
of video games including RPG (Role Playing Game), AVG
(Adventure Game) and SLG (Simulation Game).However in the conventional video game machine, the player
could manipulate a game object only by operating the
controller in hand, so that the player could only dedicate
itself to operation of the controller in silence, which was
less attractive in terms of enjoyment of manipulating the game
object.The present invention was proposed to address the
foregoing problem, and an object thereof resides in that
providing a method for voice processing, a program execution
device for executing a voice processing program, a computer
program product, in the following also referred to as a voice
processing program, and a recording medium having recorded
therein a voice processing program; all of which allow the
player to manipulate a game object using the player's voice to
thereby enhance enjoyment of the video game and pleasure of
manipulating the game object.This object is solved by the voice processing method as
defined in claim 1 and the voice processing device as defined
in claim 7. Preferred embodiments thereof are respectively
defined in the respective following sub-claims. A computer
program product according to the present invention is defined 
in claim 13 and a recording medium according to the present
invention is defined in claim 14.The present invention detects a voice tone based on input
voice information, and then outputs voice data having a voice
tone corresponded to the detected voice tone.
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A voice processing method comprising the steps of:

detecting a voice tone based on inputted voice
information; and
outputting voice data whose voice tone corresponds to
the detected voice tone.
The voice processing method according to Claim 1,
wherein the step of detecting a voice tone further comprises

the steps of:

analyzing the meaning of the inputted voice
information; and determining the voice tone based on

the analyzed meaning.
The voice processing method according to Claim 1,
wherein the step of detecting a voice tone further comprises

the steps of:

analyzing the meaning of the inputted voice
information;
detecting a voice level based on the inputted voice
information; and
determining the voice tone based on the analyzed
meaning and the detected voice level.
The voice processing method according to Claim 1, 2 or
3, further comprising the
 steps of:
determining a plurality of groups corresponding to a
plurality of voice data; and
classifying detected voice tone into at least one of
the plurality of groups,

   wherein the step of outputting voice data outputs voice
data from the at least one of the plurality of groups.
The voice processing method according to Claim 4,
wherein the plurality of groups includes at least a group for

polite tone, a group for gentle tone, a group for general tone
and a group for negligent tone.
The voice processing method according to Claim 1, 2,
3, 4 or 5, wherein the inputted voice information and the voice

data are a voice of a game player and a game object,
respectively.
A voice processing device comprising:

a voice tone detection means for detecting a voice tone
based on inputted voice information;
a voice information storage means having stored therein
voice data corresponded to a plurality of voice tones; and
a voice output-control means for outputting voice data
corresponded to the detected voice tone from the voice

information storage means.
The voice processing device according to Claim 7,
wherein the voice tone detection means analyzes meaning of

the inputted voice information and determines the voice tone
based on the analyzed meaning.
The voice processing device according to Claim 7,
wherein the voice tone detection means analyzes meaning of

the inputted voice information and detects a voice level based
on the inputted voice information, to thereby determine the

voice tone based on the analyzed meaning of the inputted voice
information and the detected voice level.
The voice processing device according to Claim 7, 8,
or 9, further comprising:


a tendency detection means for detecting tendency in
the detected voice tone; and

   wherein the voice output-control means outputs voice
data with a voice tone corresponded to a tendency in the

detected voice tone.
The voice processing device according to Claim 7, 8,
9, or 10, further comprising:


a group determination means for determining a plurality
of groups corresponding to a plurality of voice data; and
a classification means for classifying detected voice
tone into at least one of the plurality of groups,

   wherein the voice output-control means outputs voice data
from the at least one of the plurality of groups.
The voice processing device according to Claim 7, 8, 9,10,
or 11, wherein the inputted voice information and the voice

data are a voice of a game player and a game object,
respectively.
Computer program product, comprising computer programs
means adapted to perform the method steps as defined in anyone

of claims 1 to 7 when being executed on a computer, digital
signal processor or the like.
