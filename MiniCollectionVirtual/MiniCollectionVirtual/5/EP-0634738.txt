<ABSTRACT>
A MIDI/joystick interface apparatus is described which incorporates 
a shielded connector, a shielded cable, and a terminal block including a 

circuit board with an extensive ground plane surrounding the joystick 
connections and shielding the MIDI circuitry on at least three sides. 

The terminal block is a housing which acts as a radiation shield. The 
housing or terminal block may be made of an injected molded plastic 

material containing electrically conductive strands of metal or the 
housing may be plated or painted on its interior surfaces with an 

electrically conductive material to form a shielding layer which may then 
be further connected to the ground plane of the electronic circuit board 

contained within the terminal block housing. The terminal block provides 
connectors for MIDI-In, MIDI-Out MIDI-Thru and a pair of joystick 

interface connectors which allows the capability to connect both MIDI 
devices and two joysticks to the audio adapter card simultaneously.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to interface apparatus for the connecting of 
MIDI devices and at least one joystick to a computer. The need to interface a computer with a multitude of various 
external audio devices has increased dramatically with the advent of 
computer based audio products. These computer based audio products 
include a wide range of applications which can be further divided into 
several distinct categories, such as entertainment audio i.e., games and 
animation; educational audio, i.e., reading and writing tutors; training 
audio for use in commercial training programs; and, merchandising audio 
for presentations and sales. The primary use of audio adapters to date occurs in the category of 
entertainment audio with computer game audio capturing the largest market 
share by far. Audio products in the computer based games market include 
SoundBlaster (TM) computer audio adapters, available from Creative Labs, 
Inc., of Milpitas, California. Other audio adapter cards are available 
from Mediavision of Fremont, California. As the different types of connections to audio adapter cards, 
including interfaces for microphones, headphones, Musical Instrument 
Device Interface (MIDI) devices, CD-ROM drives, joysticks, etc., multiply 
in number, interface connections are constrained by the very limited 
mechanical space available for external device connectors on the back of 
IBM PC compatible computer adapter cards. The industry has turned to external breakout cables to overcome 
this very limited space constraint. Generally, external interface 
apparatus comprise one computer audio adapter card which have an external 
rear connector of high pin density and low mechanical profile. A 
corresponding high pin density external connector attached to a multi-conductor 
cable plugs into the rear external computer audio adapter 
connector. The multi-conductor cable fans out the different electrical 
signals into several discrete and distinct industry standard connectors. One very common computer game audio adapter card rear connector 
definition comprises a 15 pin D-Shell which is the mechanical and 
electrical standard for both MIDI and game joysticks. Although many  
 
manufacturers offer breakout cables for this connector, these breakout 
cables have several common shortcomings. One shortcoming is the cost associated with the hardware needed to 
meet a published interface specification for the MIDI 1.0 specification 
and the IBM PC Game Port Specification. Another shortcoming is the failure to comply with
