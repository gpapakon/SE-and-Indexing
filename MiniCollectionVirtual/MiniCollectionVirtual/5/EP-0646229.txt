<ABSTRACT>
Method and means for enhancing the visible length and color of high efficiency gas flames in an artificial gas log fireplace/gas burner system is characterized by selecting from a plurality of metallic salt compounds, compounds having a low melting point and the ability to exhibit light in the visible spectrum when the metallic salt compounds absorb energy from a gas flame. The metallic salt compounds are placed in a high temperature area of the burner system adjacent the gas flames so that at the melting point of the metallic salt an ionized vapor is generated which is directed into the path of the combustion air being supplied to the gas burner. The energy level of the ionized metallic salt compounds are elevated and when subsequently cooled, they emit light in the visible spectrum which combines with the gas flames and colors the invisible flame spectrum so that the invisible gas flames become visible and appear longer and exhibit natural colors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to high efficiency 
and low carbon monoxide gas burner systems of the type 
employed with artificial gas logs. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
adding a predetermined amount of metallic salt vapor to the 
gas to be burned by the gas burner system so that the 
relatively short invisible blue gas flames appear both 
longer and colored. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 
Emission and Safety Standards Z-21.50 (1986) only permits 
200 parts per million of carbon monoxide when burning 
gaseous fuels such as natural gas, manufactured gas and 
propane. These gasses when burned for high efficiency, high 
carbon dioxide and low carbon monoxide are known to display 
a blue color which is typical of the color produced by a gas 
stove burning natural gas. Attempts have been made to meet the ANSI pollution 
standards and to also change the blue gas flame to an orange 
gas flame which is typical of the flames produced when wood 
is burned on a grate with an adequate supply of combustion 
air.  
 In our U.S. Patent 4,875,464, a gas burner system 
is shown and described which does meet ANSI pollution 
standards and does produce gas flames which simulate the 
size and color of flames produced by wood burning logs. 
This simulated effect was produced by using hot metal 
shields to direct the gas flames away from the artificial 
logs which would act as a heat sink and raise the carbon 
monoxide to prohibitive levels. Further, the fuel air ratio 
was set at a near critical level in order to produce the 
desirable orange colored flames. In our U.S. Patent 5,000,162, a gas burner system 
is shown and described which simulates the size and color of 
glowing embers and which also meets ANSI pollution 
standards. Heretofore, glowing embers were designed to 
resemble hot glowing coals or wood charcoal which did not 
exhibit flames. It is known that heat-stable metal compounds 
enhance the combustion of carbonaceous fuels. U.S. Patent 
4,992,041 shows and describes ceramic tubes which have a 
slurry mixture coating of aluminum oxide, soda lime glass 
and a metallic compound based thereon. The dense slurry 
which contained a small percentage of metallic compound was 
formed as a baked coating 1,59 to 0,79 mm (1/16th to 1/32nd inch) thick on a 
6,35 mm (1/4 inch) tube. The treated ceramic tubes were placed in the 
secondary reaction zone of the gas flame where the gas 
temperatures falls in the range between 649째C to 871째C (1200째 F to 1600째

<CLAIMS>
An artificial log gas fireplace including means for 
introducing metallic ions into the gas 

flames, characterised in that the ion introducing means 
comprises a carrier (36) carrying a volatile metallic salt 

compound (37) supported in a hot area beside the gas flames in 
the path of combustion air being supplied to the gas 

flames whereby the heating of the volatile metallic salt 
compound produces ionised vapour which is carried into the 

gas flames by the combustion air and is energised by the 
burning gas (27) to produce visible light.

in which the carrier comprises a porous sheath. 
An artificial log gas fireplace according to claim 2 
in which the porous sheath comprises a layer of ceramic 

wool fiber (13). 
An artificial log gas fireplace according to claim 2 

in which the porous sheath comprises a metal mesh. 
An artificial log gas fireplace according to claim 1 
in which the carrier comprises a perforated trough (41). 
An artificial log gas fireplace according to claim 5 
in which the perforated trough is provided with a layer of 

ceramic wool fiber supporting granular volatile metallic 
compound salts. 
An artificial log gas fireplace according to claim 5 
or claim 6 in which the perforated trough is juxtaposed to 

a burner of the fireplace.  
 
An artificial log gas fireplace according to claim 1 
in which the volatile metallic salt compound is combined 

with high temperature fibers to form a solid mass. 
An artificial log gas fireplace according to claim 8

of the gas flames in a position where the temperature is 
substantially lower than in the hot reaction zones and 

where vapour from the volatile metallic salt compound 
mixes into the combustion air.
