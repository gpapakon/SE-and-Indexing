<ABSTRACT>
To obtain an apparatus for syntactic signal analysis which is suitable for processing 
signals which deviate, within a freely selected margin, from a set of signals 

predetermined by a grammar, the apparatus is provided with a feature unification 
mechanism which detects violations of features, and an adaptive thresholdmechanism 

coupled thereto. The feature unification mechanism which processes the features in 
groups, so that rapid processing is obtained, determines a violation score. This 

provides a measure of the deviation of the analysed signal from the set of signals 
predetermined by the grammar and indicates what elements of the signal are not 

satisfactory so that these can be corrected if necessary. The adaptive threshold 
mechanism enables a number of analyses to be delivered each having a violation score, 

so that on the basis thereof in combination with other factors which may be available it 
is possible to select the best analysis. The apparatus is applicable to signal correction, 

signal verification and signal recognition.
 

Also relates to a method of syntactic signal analysis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to apparatus for syntactic signal analysis comprising a
conversion unit for converting an input signal to primitives and to normalized
primitives corresponding to the primitives, a pattern recognition unit connected to the
conversion unit, for providing a syntactic analysis of, in each case, a string of
normalized primitives by reference to a grammar, and a memory unit for storing the
grammar, said grammar comprising terms which are ordered in rewriting rules and
which also comprise terminals corresponding to normalized primitives; the invention
also relates to a method for syntactic signal analysis.Signals are processed in a large number of technical fields. However, these
signals are sometimes mutilated caused by various reasons. In most cases, it is
advantageous to have available unmutilated signals. If it is known beforehand that the
unmutilated signals must satisfy certain rules, it is possible to check whether the
available signals really do satisfy these rules and, if this does not appear to be the
case, to discard or correct the signals.A technique known in the art for checking whether signals satisfy certain rules is
the syntactic method or parsing technique. For an introduction to this see,
respectively, "Digital Pattern Recognition", Springer-Verlag (1980), by K. S. Fu
(editor), pp. 95- 134, and "Digital image processing", John Wiley & Sons (1978), by
W. K. Pratt, pp. 574-578.In this method, the signal is first segmented into primitive elements. These
primitive elements, which will hereinafter be designated primitives, are then classified
and replaced by a normalized primitive. A normalized primitive of this kind is a
prototype of a certain class or category. A check is then made whether a string of
normalized primitives obtained in this way satisfies a grammar. A grammar
comprises a number of rules, known as rewriting or production rules, each consisting
of a number of terms, terminals or non-terminals, and each predetermining a way in
which a set of terms may be rewritten to form a non- terminal. The grammar also
defines a starting symbol. The starting symbol is a non-terminal. The defined classes 
or categories and accordingly the normalized primitives correspond one by one to the
terminals from the grammar. A bottom-up parsing procedure consists of applying suitable rewriting rules to a
string of normalized primitives and to intermediately obtained rewriting results until the
starting symbol is obtained. The application of rewriting rules in each case means
joining
