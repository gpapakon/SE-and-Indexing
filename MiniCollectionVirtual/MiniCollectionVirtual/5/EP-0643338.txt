<ABSTRACT>
A multi-color electrophotographic apparatus is provided 
which includes a casing having an access cover (36A), an image transfer 

belt unit (37) for transferring a multi-colored image formed thereon a 
recording sheet, and an image-forming assembly (55) having a plurality 

of 
image-forming units. Each image-forming unit includes a 

photoconductor (46) and a developer (63) storing therein toner of a 
single 

different color for forming a different color toner image on each 
photoconductor (46). The image-forming assembly (55) is arranged to be 

movable between operative and inoperative positions. The operative 
position is such that each image-forming unit lies at an image-forming 

station with the photoconductor (46) thereof in engagement 
with an image transfer belt (38) of the image transfer belt (37) 

unit to transfer 
the toner image formed thereon in registration with one another to 

the image transfer belt for forming the multi-colored image. The 
inoperative position is such that all the photoconductors of the 

image-forming assembly are out of engagement with the image 
transfer belt for allowing an apparatus operator to unload the image 

transfer belt unit from the casing through the access cover (36A) 
without 

damaging each photoconductor due to rubbing with the image 
transfer belt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a multi-color 
printer, and more particularly concerns an improved structure of a 
multi-color electrophotographic printer which is designed to be 
compact and to provide for easy maintenance while assuring 
machine reliability and performance as well as copy quality. In conventional color electrophotography, a multi-colored 
image may be formed by superimposing yellow, magenta, cyan, and 
black toner images in registration to a transfer member in two 
different ways. One is referred to as a transfer drum system 
wherein different color toner images are sequentially formed on a 
single photoconductor and then transferred in registration to a 
transfer member wrapped about a transfer drum. The second is 
referred to as a successive transfer system wherein different color 
toner images formed on respective photoconductors are transferred 
in sequence to a transfer member carried by a belt. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 1-252982 teaches a 
conventional transfer drum system which, as shown in Fig. 1, 
includes a photoconductor 1, a charging unit 2, a developing station 
3, a transfer drum 4, and a photoconductor cleaner 5. The 
developing station 3 includes a Y-developer 6 for forming a yellow 
toner image, an M-developer 7 for forming a magenta toner image, a  
 
C-developer 8 for forming a cyan toner image, and a Bk-developer 9 
for forming a black toner image. The developer station 3 rotates to 
move each developer in sequence into engagement with the 
photoconductor 1. In operation, the photoconductor 1 is rotated 
counterclockwise to have its surface charged uniformly by the 
charging unit 2. Subsequently in response to a yellow image-forming 
signal, a laser beam 10 is radiated to the photoconductor 1 
to form an electrostatic latent image which is, in turn, developed by 
the Y-developer 6 to form a yellow toner image. One copy sheet is 
fed from a sheet supply station 11 and then wrapped about the 
periphery of the transfer drum 4 with its leading edge being held by 
a claw 12 until the yellow toner image formed on the 
photoconductor 1 is advanced into engagement with the transfer 
drum. The rotation of the transfer drum 4 is so timed that a 
specified portion of the copy sheet wrapped about the transfer drum 
may coincide with the yellow toner image. The yellow toner image on the photoconductor 1 is 
transferred to the copy sheet under activities of a transfer charging 
unit 13. Alter the image transfer, the surface of the photoconductor
