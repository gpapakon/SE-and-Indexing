<ABSTRACT>
The machine comprises: two or more modules (2,3), each 
having two containers (4,6) and each container having two 

vertical vessels (8,10) with respective open upper ends; a 
bottom portion (12) places the vessels (8,10) in communication 

with each other. Each module has two, alternately operating, 
hydraulic fabric drive means (24), situated above the 

open upper ends of the vessels (8,10); for each module (2,3) 
a pumping means (28) draws liquor from the containers (4,6), 

forces it through a filter (32) and sends it to the hydraulic 
drive means (24). A fan (60) blows air to a guide means (62) 

for leading the fabric (14) from one container (4,6) to 
another and the guide means (62) is provided at the top 

thereof with a cylindrical configuration (64) having a horizontal 
generating line allowing the air through and forming 

an air cushion between the fabric (14) and the guide means 
(62).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a machine for the wet treatment of
fabrics, by a supply of liquor, the machine having an input device for
the slow infeed of the fabric and a delivery device for the slow delivery
of the fabric, and a plurality of containers, each container defining a
first generally vertical vessel having an open upper end, a second
generally vertical vessel having an open upper end and a bottom
portion placing said vessels in communication one with the other.The wet treatment of fabrics is frequently carried out on a piece
in "rope" form, i.e. a piece of fabric longitudinally rolled up and being
joined at the ends. This fabric rope is inserted in a closed circuit where
it has to remain for a considerable time. At the end of the treatment, it
is laborious to unwind the piece again. Furthermore, more or less
considerable stresses are created, resulting in an undesired stretching
of the fabric in the warp direction.In other known processes, the fabric is treated in "open width"
form, i.e. without it being necessary to wind it longitudinally, as
mentioned above. Nevertheless, for the fabric to be in contact with the
treatment liquor for sufficient time, long, bulky installations are
required, which obviously involves a notable increase in cost.
Furthermore, undesirable stresses and lengthening of the treated
fabric regularly occur.In the document GB-A- 857.225
(upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based)
a machine is described for the wet
treatment, of fabrics which comprises a series of U-shaped containers
full of liquor. The fabric is fed into the bath through one of the upper
ends of the U-shaped container by means of a system of rollers, and is
removed at the other upper end of the U-shaped container by means 
of another system of rollers. Although the fabric is accumulated inside
the U-shaped container in a folded fashion, which allows a
considerable amount of the fabric to be fed therein, the liquor does not
energetically penetrate the fabric, and neither does the fabric knock
against the surface of the bath, an effect which improves the washing
and softening of the fabric.In the document DE-A- 2752172 a machine is described for the
wet treatment of fabrics which comprises two containers full of liquor
and a central roller, placed between both containers. The fabric is fed
slowly into the first container by means of a first roller and is removed
slowly from the second container by means of a second roller. The
central roller rotates alternatively from one side to the other, during
present

<CLAIMS>
A machine for the wet treatment of fabrics, by a supply of liquor, the
machine having an input d
evice (66) for the slow infeed of the fabric and a delivery
device (68) for the slow delivery of the fabric, and a plurality of containers (4,6),

each container (4,6) defining a first generally vertical vessel (8) having an open
upper end, a second generally vertical vessel (10) having an open upper end and

a bottom portion (12) placing said vessels (8,10) in communication one with the
other, characterized in that it comprises: (a) at least two modules (2,3), each having a

first container (4) and a second container (6); (b) for each module, two, alternately
operating hydraulic fabric drive means (24) in form of nozzles (26) through which

the liquor is forced thereby driving the fabric therethrough, respectively situated
above the open upper end of one vessel (10) of the first container (4) and above

the open upper end of a vessel (8) of the second container (6); (c) a pumping

means (62) for leading the fabric (14) from one to the other container (4,6) of the
same module (2,3), said guide means (62) receiving air from said fan (60) and

having at the top thereof a cylindrical configuration (64) having a horizontal
generating line, allowing said air to pass therethrough to form an air cushion or

pneumatic pulley between the fabric (14) and said guide means (62).
