<ABSTRACT>
The dual mode communication network comprises a first communication system having a frame structure and a first traffic channel protocol and a second communication system having the frame structure and a second traffic channel protocol. In the network, only one of the first and second traffic channel protocols supports forward error correction coding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to communication systems and,
more particularly, to a dual mode communication network.In the current cellular communication systems, pedestrian users will access the
mobiles cellular network. This mobile cellular network will provide the continual
overhead measurements used by the system to maintain channel quality or
perform hand-off functions. Since these measurements require the same amount
of processing whether the user is mobile or not, a pedestrian user is charged the
same fee for using their phone as the user who is mobile.Therefore, there exists a need in the industry for a personal communication
system (PCS) which would provide a low tier system for pedestrian users at a
reduced cost. The low tier system would provide access via radio frequency (RF)
link to a basic cellular network which may or may not provide hand-off capability.
For purposes of this discussion, a pedestrian user is one who roams slowly (10
kph, kilometers per hour, or less) as opposed to mobile (up to 100 kph or more)
user.European patent application EP-A-415 502 describes a single mode
communications system that is "different from GSM and DECT," although it "has
features which enable it to be implemented by using components developed for, or
based on those developed for, GSM and DECT equipment and in consequence the
system can be established rather rapidly." A dual mode communication network is provided comprising a first
communication system having a frame structure and a first traffic channel
protocol and a second communication communication system having the same
frame structure and a second traffic channel protocol. In the network, any one of
the first and second traffic channel protocols supports forward error correction
coding. The dual mode communication network is characterised by a control device
(91) for automatically selecting said first traffic channel protocol or said second
traffic channel protocol based upon communication network parameters, wherein
only one of said first and second traffic channel protocols uses a forward error
correction coding feature and a combination of a code division and a time division
multiple access methods and a remaining one of said first and second traffic
channel protocols utilizes a time division multiple access method.FIG 1. is a block diagram representing a cell structure for a communication
system embodying the present invention;FIG. 2 is a frame structure for a low tier communication system embodying
