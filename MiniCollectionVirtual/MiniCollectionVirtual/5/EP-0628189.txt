<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a digital image analysis method for automatically identifying an object in a background, characterizing the object by color by determining at least one interior point of the object, and displaying the object on a monitor in color corresponding to the natural color of the object and a digital image analysis method for displaying an object on a monitor in color. The methods are adaptive in that they create a new pallette for each image being processed. The system used to implement the methods is cost effective in that a black-and-white image processing board can be used in conjunction with a color filter and a color monitor.

 TITLE ADAPTIVE DISPLAY SYSTEM The present application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/990,703, filed December 31, 1992, which is a continuation-in-part of application Serial No. 07/767,339, filed September 27, 1991.MICROFICHE APPENDIX Attached hereto are microfiche containing 86 frames of modules which can be employed in the described embodiments and in other embodiments. These microfiche are included as a portion of the disclosure of this patent document.COPYRIGHT NOTICE A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method of displaying an object on a monitor in color corresponding to the natural color of the object and to a digital image analysis method for automatically identifying an object in a background, characterizing the object by color by determining at least one interior point of the object, and displaying the object on a monitor in color corresponding to the natural color of the object.2. Description Of The Related ArtThe ability to access interior points of a region when its contour is given is a classic problem in image processing. Previous solutions to this problem have been described by L. W. Chang and K. L. Leu in an article entitled "A Fast Algorithm for the Restoration of Images Based on Chain Codes Description and Its Applications", Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing 50, 296- 

307 (1990) . One algorithm described, connectivity filling, requires that every pixel in the image be interrogated. Since the number of pixels within an object is greater than the number of pixels which comprise the perimeter of the object, such a technique is relatively slow. Another method described is parity checking, which is based on the fact that intersection of a straight line with the contour regions of an object delineates an even number of points on the perimeter of the object. Designation of the interior points is determined by an arbitrary filing rule where all points between each odd point and the next even point on the contour in each line of the image are designated as interior points. Such a parity checking algorithm will not work with objects of complex shape.In the

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A digital image analysis method for displaying an object on a monitor in color corresponding to the color of the object, comprising the steps of:
(a) generating a plurality of images of the object and a background thereof, each image being one of three primary color images or a black and white image;
(b) searching at least one image for the object; (c) determining the interior points of the object;
(d) determining the gray level values of at least one predetermined interior point;
(e) calculating at least one color parameter of the predetermined interior point;
(f) calculating at least one color parameter index for each predetermined interior point of each object;
(g) preparing a table of gray level values corresponding to the color parameter index of each predetermined interior point for the object;
(h) defining an image buffer wherein the locations corresponding to the interior points of the object are assigned the color parameter index of each predetermined interior point; and
(i) copying the image buffer to the monitor to display the object in color corresponding to the color of each predetermined interior point as determined by the color parameter index. 2. The image analysis method of claim 1, wherein the step of searching the image comprises using at least one automatically calculated threshold.
3. The image analysis method of claim 1, wherein the step of determining the interior points comprises determining the center of mass of the object.

11. The image analysis method of claim 10, wherein the step of copying the image buffer to the monitor comprises copying the image buffer to the monitor to display the objects in a color corresponding to the color of the center of mass of each object as determined by the hue index.
12. A method of identifying, characterizing and displaying by color at least one valid object having at least one predetermined attribute value in a background, comprising the steps of:
(a) generating a plurality of images of a candidate object and the background, each image being one of three primary color images or a black and white image; 


 (b) searching at least one image for at least one candidate object;
(c) determining at least one interior point of the candidate object; (d) determining the gray level values of the interior points in at least one of the images;
(e) calculating at least one color parameter for the interior points of the candidate object;

(g) validating the candidate object having the valid object predetermined attribute value to identify the valid object;
(h) calculating a color parameter index for at least one predetermined interior point for each valid object;
(i) preparing a table of gray level values corresponding to the color parameter index of the each predetermined interior point; (j) defining an image buffer wherein the locations corresponding to the interior points of each object are assigned the color parameter index of each predetermined interior point of each valid object; and (k) copying the image buffer to the monitor to display each valid object in color of each predetermined interior point of each valid object as determined by the color parameter index.
