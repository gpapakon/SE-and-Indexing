<ABSTRACT>
In order to use less relatively expensive printing ribbon (4), in particular thermal transfer ribbon, when a gap in the recording medium which is not to be printed passes through the printing zone (2) between two labels or the like to be printed, the thermal transfer ribbon (4) is stopped on completion of the printing operation of a first label or the like and, at the same time, the pressing-on force of the print head (9), in particular the thermal print head, against the back pressure roller (8) is ceased. As soon as the next label or the like passes into the printing zone (2), the pressure on the thermal print head is activated again and the further transporting of the thermal transfer ribbon (4) is effected at the same time. The controlled stopping of the thermal transfer ribbon (4) takes place with the aid of a halting device (14) which fixes the first reel (1) from which the ribbon (4) is uncoiled and with the aid of a slip clutch (15) which allows the second reel (3) which coils the ribbon to remain stationary at the same time despite the drive motor (17) continuing to run. The control takes place via the control device of the printing machine which is present in any case.

<CLAIMS>
A printer with a print head (9) mounted so as
to be disengaged from, and spring-biased into engagement

with, a counterpressure roller (8), said print head and
said counterpressure roller having passing between them

the active strand (7) of a printing ribbon (4) and of a
medium to be printed, with a device being provided for

eliminating the application pressure between the counterpressure
roller (8) and the print head (9) during stop-page

of the printing ribbon (4), in which, in order to
conserve printing ribbon (4), said device for eliminating

the application pressure between the counterpressure
roller (8) and the print head (9) is activatable when

segments of the medium to be printed are to remain blank,
the medium to be printed continues being moved in the intermediate

areas of the medium which are not printed
while the printing ribbon (4) is stopped, and the printing

ribbon (4) is wound off of a first spool (1),

characterized in that
 during stoppage of the printing
ribbon (4) a control system of the printer operates to

cause a stopping device (14) for the printing ribbon (4)
to be moved into an active position, and that the printing

ribbon (4) is adapted to be stopped indirectly by
means of stoppage of the first spool (1), said locking

device (14) cooperating with said first spool (1).
The printer as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the printing ribbon (4) is wound onto a
second spool (3), and that a slip clutch (15) is interposed

between a drive mechanism (17) for the printing
ribbon (4) and the spool (3) driven by the drive mechanism

(17) for taking up the printing ribbon (4). 
The printer as claimed in any one of the claims
1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the first spool (1) is non-rotationally
connected to an externally toothed gear (20)

which is operatively associated with a locking tooth (21)
which can be engaged with and disengaged from the toothed

gear by means of the control system.
The printer as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 the locking tooth (21) is located on a pivot
arm (22) which can be retained in an inactive position by

means of a controllable locking element (25).
The printer as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized
in that
 the locking element (25) can be moved from
its engaged position into a dise
ngaged position and vice-versa
by means of a controllable drive mechanism (26).
The printer as claimed in claim 4 or 5, 
characterized
in that
 the locking element (25) is located on a
pivotally mounted lever (27) which is adjustable by means

of a cam drive mechanism (28) which forms the controllable
drive mechanism.
The printer as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized
in that
 a pin (32) is eccentrically attached to a
drivable rotational element (33) and engaged in an elongated

slot (31) which is located on the pivotal lever
(27), at some distance from the axis of rotation (30) of

said pivotal lever. 
The printer as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized
in that
 said pivotal lever (27) is an angle lever
and said elongated slot (31) is provided in the vicinity

of the angle corner and extends approximately in the
longitudinal direction of the hinged leg (34), with the

free leg (35) supporting or forming the locking element
(25).
The printer as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized
in that
 the free leg (35) of the angular pivotal
lever (27), when in the position of use, occupies an

approximately vertical position and its free end forms
the locking element (25), with the pivot arm (22) taking

support on top upon the free end of said leg.
The printer as claimed in claim 9, 
characterized
in that
 the pivot arm (22) is a one-armed lever
which has on its free end a preferably convex support

(36), with the locking tooth (21) being arranged between
the pivot bearing (24) and the support (36).
The printer as claimed in any one of the claims
8 to 10, 
characterized in that
 the hinged leg (34) of the
pivotal angle lever (27) is extended beyond the bearing

(30), with the extending arm (37) forming part of the
adjustment drive mechanism for the print head (9).
