  wherein   R1 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, halogen, C1-C15-alkyl, C1-C15-alkoxy or a radical of the formula 
<
IMAGE

   R2 and R3, independently of one another, are hydrogen or C1-C15-alkoxy,   R4 is C1-C5-alkyl or C1-C5-alkoxy-C1-C5-alkyl and   Q is a C1-C4-alkylene radical,   the rings A, B and C can contain further substituents and   the compound must contain at least two C1-C15-alkoxy radicals.   The compounds according to the invention are suitable as stabilisers for textile fibre materials, in particular polyester fibre materials, and for organic polymers. They are additionally suitable as sunscreen agents in cosmetic preparations.
