<ABSTRACT>
Cover for a waste container consisting of a cover plate (3) with peripheral wall which fits onto the standing upper rim (2) of the container, in which cover plate is recessed a circular opening (4) which is closable by a circular lid (7), wherein an outer peripheral wall of the lid and the inner periphery of the recess have co-acting cams for locking the lid in the recess, wherein the cams (23, 24, 60, 62) are disposed in different levels or are elongate and are disposed sloping relative to the line of symmetry of the lid such that an opening is formed between the one end of a cam and the other end of the adjacent cam, which opening serves for passage of the co-acting cam, wherein the axially oriented lower surface of the one cam in addition to the opposite axial surface of the other co-acting cam have indentations for defining different closing positions of the lid in the cover plate, whereby one or more intermediate positions of the lid in which the lid can be removed, and an end position in which the lid is permanently locked are obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cover for a waste 
container consisting of a cover plate with peripheral 
skirt which fits onto the standing upper rim of the 
container, said cover plate having a recessed circular 
opening which is closable by a circular lid, wherein the 
outer peripheral wall of the lid and the inner peripheral 
wall of the recess have co-acting cams for locking the 
lid in the recess. An example of such a cover is 
disclosed by EP-A-0 455 172. The waste containers as referred to above are 
normally used for receiving waste for burning because of 
the infectious nature thereof. This is usually hospital 
waste, and such a container is filled up gradually. For 
this purpose the cover for the container can be placed in 
two positions, that is, a temporary position in which the 
cover can be lifted from the container in order to fill 
the container, as well as a permanent position wherein 
the cover is fixed permanently on the container which 
when filled is placed in an incinerator. The cover is 
moreover embodied with an additional opening which can be 
closed and which serves for admitting small amounts of 
waste and for monitoring the contents. In this case the 
entire cover does not have to be lifted. The invention 
relates particularly to this small closable opening. It is customary to give this opening a circular form 
and close it by means of a circular lid. This lid also 
has to be placed in different positions, in particular a 
temporary one in which the lid part can easily be 
detached again, wherein the additional requirement is 
made that the lid part serves as hand-grip to enable 
lifting of the wholly or partially filled container and 
moving thereof into a definitive closing position.  
 Heretofore it has been difficult to embody the 
closure of the lid part in the circular hole of a cover 
such that it suffices for the temporary and permanent 
closure and the carrying function thereof. The invention has for its object to improve the 
closure of the lid part in the cover such that the above 
stated drawbacks are obviated. The cover according to a first embodiment of the 
invention which is covered by claim 1 is characterized 
in that the cams on the lid are constituted by flexible hooks, cooperating with a 
plurality of co-acting cams on the cover, said co-acting 
cams being arranged in peripherally extending rows, and 
on different height levels with respect to the axis of 
the cover. The cover according to a second embodiment of the invention which is covered by 
claim 5 is

<CLAIMS>
A cover for a waste container (1) consisting of a 
cover plate (3) having a peripheral skirt which fits over the 

upper rim of the container (1), said cover plate 
(3) having a recessed circular opening (4) which is 

closable by a circular lid (7), wherein the outer 
peripheral wall of the lid (7) and the inner peripheral 

wall of the recess have co-acting cams for locking the 
lid in the recess, 
characterized in that
, the cams on the 
lid are constituted by flexible hooks cooperating with a 

plurality of co-acting cams on the cover, said co-acting 
cams being arranged in peripherally extending rows, and 

on different height levels with respect to the axis of 
the cover. 
Cover as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
, the lid is provided with a rim (19) having an 
opening (20) to receiving said co-acting cams. 
Cover as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in 
that
, the rim (19) is provided with extensions (21, 22) 
bordering said openings (20). 
Cover as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized in 
that
, said rim (19) is offset with a parallel elongation 
(27, 29). 
Cover for a waste container (1) consisting of a 
cover plate (3) having a peripheral skirt which fits over the 

upper rim of the container (1), said cover plate 
(3) having a recessed circular opening (4) which is 

closable by a circular lid (47), wherein the outer 
peripheral wall of the lid (47) and the inner peripheral 

wall of the recess have co-acting elongate cams (60, 61, 
62, 63) for locking the lid in the recess, said cams 

being disposed sloping relative to the axis of the lid, 
such that a spacing (70) is provided between the  

 
one end of a cam (60) and the other end of the adjacent 

cam (62), said spacing (70) serving for the passage of the 
co-acting cam (61), 
characterized in that
 the axially 
oriented lower surface of the one cam (60) in addition to 

the opposite axial surface of the other co-acting cam 
(61) have a number of, preferably two, indentations (65, 

66, 67, 68) for defining different closing positions of 
the lid (47) in the co
ver plate (3) and wherein the other 
end of the co-acting cam has a hook-shaped member (71) 

and the other end of the one cam has a resilient counter-member 
(72) for permanent hooking of the cams into one 

another. 
Cover as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in 
that
 a second cam (62) with hook-shaped counter-member 
(73) is arranged in the line of the one cam (60). 
Cover as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in 
that
 the second elongate cam (62) has a resilient upward 
oriented lip on the other end remote from the counter-member 

(73).
