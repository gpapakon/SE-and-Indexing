<CLAIMS>
An electrical discharge machine (2) having a dielectric 
container (14) substantially in the manner of a hollow 

cylinder, the side wall of which comprises at least two 
wall portions (18, 20) following one another in the 

direction of the periphery of the cylinder,
characterised in that
 the wall portions (18, 20) can be 
displaced towards one another in the peripheral 

direction.

characterised in that
 the wall portions (18, 20) are 
constructed substantially as half-cylinders. 
An electrical discharge machine according to Claim 1 or 
2,
characterised in that
 the wall portions (18, 20) are 
displaceable parallel to one another. 
An electrical discharge machine according to one of the 
preceding Claims,
characterised in that
 one of the wall portions (18) is or 
can be attached securely in a guide groove (22) embedded 

in the bottom of the dielectric container.
