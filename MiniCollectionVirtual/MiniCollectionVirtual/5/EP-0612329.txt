Thickeners based on an aqueous preparation of
nonionic, water-dispersible or water-soluble polyurethanes

obtainable by reaction of

(a) polyfunctional isocyanates with
(b) polyether polyols,
(c) monohydric alcohols and
(d) if desired, polyhydric alcohols,

characterized in that the monohydric alcohols (c) contain
at least one other polar group, with the condition that this

group is non-reactive towards isocyanates and that it is a
ester-, amide- and/or oxazoline-group.
Thickeners as claimed in claim 1, characterized in
that the polyether polyols (b) used for the production of

the polyurethanes at least predominantly contain polyalkylene
glycols, more particularly polyethylene glycol

and/or polypropylene glycol.
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the polyalkylene

glycols have an average content of alkoxy units of 20 to
400 and, more particularly, 160 to 210.
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the monohydric

alcohols (c) with the general formula R
2
-OH contain up to
20 aliphatic carbon atoms in the moiety R
2
 of the molecule
and an ester, amide and/or oxazoline group as additional

polar group(s).
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that (c) at least predominantly

contains ricinoloxazoline and/or castor oil
fatty acid methyl ester, preferably castor oil fatty acid

methyl ester.
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the polyfunctional

isocyanates (a) used for the production of the polyurethanes 
at least predominantly contain dicyclohexylmethane

diisocyanate and/or tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate
(TMXDI) , preferably TMXDI.
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the polyurethanes

correspond to the following general formula:


in which

R
1
is H or CH
3
, preferably H,
R
2
is the residue of the monohydric alcohol (c) reacted
with isocyanate
R
3
is the residue of the diisocyanate reacted with
isocyanate-reactive OH groups
n =
20 to 400 and
m =
1 to 10, preferably 1 to 5 and more preferably 1 or
2.
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the polyhydric

alcohols at least predominantly contain trihydric alcohols,
more particularly trimethylol propane (TMP).
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the OH:NCO ratio is

1:1.
Thickeners as claimed in at least one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the content of OH

groups introduced by the polyhydric alcohols, based on
the total quantity of OH groups, is 0 to 50%.
Thickeners as claimed in at least any of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the content of

polyurethanes is 30 to 45% by weight and more particularly
40 to 43% by weight. 
A process for the production of the thickeners
claimed in at least one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that (b), (c) and if desired (d) are reacted
with (a) in any order and preferably at the same time.
A process as claimed in claim 12, characterized in
that the reaction of (a), (b), (c) and if desired (d) is

carried out in the absence of solvents.
The use of the thickeners claimed in at least one of
claims 1 to 11 as such, more particularly as thickeners

for emulsion paints.
