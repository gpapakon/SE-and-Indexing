<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of organic 
chemistry. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
method for preparing α-substituted ω-hydroperfluoroalkanes. Known in the art are methods to prepare α-substituted 
ω-hydroperfluoroalkanes, for example, a 
method for the preparation of dihydroperfluoroalkanes 
which includes photoinitiated chlorination of α,α,ω-trihydroperfluoroalcohols 
(telomeric alcohols) of the 
general formula: H(CF2CF2)nCH2OH wherein n=1-5 (Brace 
Neal.O, J.Org.Chem., 1961, 26, No.10, pp.4005-4010). The 
reaction process proceeds at a temperature of 10 to 30° C 
for 2-7 hours to form the corresponding aldehydes that 
are then converted into dihydroperfluoroalkanes by 
treatment of them with 50 % aqueous solution of potassium 
hydroxide. This method has proved, however, faulty for its 
complicated production process associated with the 
employment of UV light sources and an aggressive and 
toxic chlorine medium, and the necessity of conducting 
the process in two stages. The method has a low 
conversion (10-25%) of the starting materials and a 
sufficiently low selectivity of the reaction yield (38-68%) 
of the desired products in terms of the amount of 
the converted alcohol (yields of the desired products are 
less than 17% based on alcohol to be charged). It should 
be also noted that the formation of aldehydes is 
accompanied by evolution of HCl gas, and, therefore, 
further neutralization step should be added. For the 
reasons as stated above this method failed to find 
industrial use. Known in the art are the processes to prepare ω-hydroperfluorocarboxylic 
acids, which include the  
 
oxidation reaction of α,α,ω-trihydroperfluoroalcohols 
(telomeric alcohols) with various oxidizing agents. It has been proposed a method for the preparation 
of ω-hydroperfluorocarboxylic acids of the formula 
H(CF2CF2)nCOOH wherein n= 1-4, which includes the 
oxidation reaction of telomeric alcohols with nitric 
oxides (see, SU-A-314748). The oxidation reaction is 
carried out at a temperature of 350 to 400°C with 4 moles 
of nitrogen dioxide used for 1 mol of the initial 
alcohol. The yields of ω-hydroperfluorocarboxylic acids 
having odd number of carbon atoms are 43.4% for ω-hydroperfluorovaleric 
acid and 48.0% for ω-hydroperfluoroenanthic 
acid. Thus, this method does not 
ensure high yields of the desired products. In addition, 
the oxidation reaction is carried out at high 
temperatures, and the treatment of the resulting 
aggressive mixture consisting of
