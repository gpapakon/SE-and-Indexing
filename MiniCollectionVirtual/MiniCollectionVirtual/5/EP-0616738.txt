<ABSTRACT>
It is therefore the purpose of the invention to provide a rotor winding with stabler thermal and mechanical behaviour. The cross-section of the coil rods (2) closest to the coil sealing wedge or the coil head insert (5) is double that of the coil rods (7). In order nevertheless to obtain better coil cooling the coil rods (2 and 7) have cooling slots (10). The invention makes it possible for the first time to offset the normally poor cooling of the electric motor and the concomitant low heat dissipation from the rotor by the substantially better mechanical stability of the winding. This is principally because the larger cross-section of the coil rod reduces the current density in the same proportion.

Rotor winding for an electrical machine, in particular 
for a turbo generator, which rotor winding consists of 

several coils, the individual coils being constructed 
from several windings connected in series, these windings 

being preferably composed of two half windings or winding 
bars (7), and the winding bars being arranged in the 

longitudinal slots of the rotor (1) and each longitudinal 
slot (9) being closed externally in the radial direction 

by a slot wedge (1), 
characterised in that
 the radial 
height, at least of the winding bar (2) adjacent to the 

slot wedge (1), is greater than the radial height of the 
remaining winding bars (7) provided in the longitudinal 

slot (9). 
Rotor winding according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
the factor for the increase in the radial height of the 

winding bar (2) is 1.2 to 3, preferably 1.8 to 2.2.
