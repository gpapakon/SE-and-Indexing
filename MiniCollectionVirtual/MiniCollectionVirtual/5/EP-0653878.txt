<ABSTRACT>
A digital halftone pattern geometry adapted not 
to the characteristics of variable dot size printing 

presses but to the operating characteristics of the 
printer itself achieves a high degree of image quality. 

The techniques for creating the halftone pattern geometry 
include linear spot growth to provide uniform darkening 

and the use of a super-cell structure to maximize the 
number of tint or gray scale levels. A preferred super-cell 

structure is of hexagonal dispersed-dot form to 
reduce low frequency artifacts by spreading them over a 

greater number of frequencies. Hexagonal centered super-cells 
also distribute row and column artifacts along three 

axes of symmetry instead of two. The super-cell structure 
gives sharp edges and a greater amount of edge area 

available to manipulate when the super-cells are 
tessellated to form an image. This halftone cell 

arrangement is especially suited to thermal transfer 
printers, which print linear rows and form good 

rectangular shapes. The resulting image exhibits smooth 
darkening even for cells having few pixels.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital image printing
(e.g., thermal transfer, phase-change (hot melt) ink jet,
and laser xerography) and, in particular, to
a method of implementing digital ordered dithering for
halftoning to preserve detail in output images produced by
low resolution printers.The following background information is
presented only by way of example with reference to thermal
transfer printing. Thermal transfer printing entails the
controlled transfer of an ink (e.g., a colorant dispersed
in a wax base material) from a carrier such as a polymer
ribbon onto a print medium surface. A thermal transfer
printer having a print head with a large number of
independently activable heating elements per unit of
length is one prior art apparatus employed for this
purpose. The ink/carrier structure is placed within the
printer such that the carrier side is adjacent the heating
elements and the ink side is adjacent a print media
support upon which the print medium rests during printing.To print an image, the print head contacts the
polymer ribbon and ink is transferred to particular 
locations on the print medium surface when predetermined
combinations of heating elements are activated adjacent
the image-forming locations. The ink/carrier structure is
locally heated by the heating elements to a temperature at
or above the melting point of the ink. In this manner, an
amount of ink softens and adheres to the print medium at
the predetermined locations to form the image.Color images are printed with an ink/carrier
structure that includes separate regions of differently
colored inks such as the subtractive primary colors,
yellow, magenta, and cyan. Color printing is accomplished
by sequential passes of the print medium past the print
head, each pass selectively transferring different colored
inks at predetermined times. Thermal printing ribbons are
available with a single black panel, three color panels
(yellow, magenta, and cyan), or four color panels,
(yellow, magenta, cyan, and black).Many printers include a control software driver
program (hereafter "printer driver") for handling various
aspects of the printer operation. Such printer drivers
are often interfaced to a computer programming language
known as PostScript®, which is available from Adobe
Systems Inc., Mountain View, California. The PostScript®
language, described in the PostScript® Language Reference
Manual, Second Edition, 1990, Addison-Wesley Publishing
Co., Reading, Massachusetts, includes methods for
manipulating text and graphics, selecting

<CLAIMS>
A method creating a halftone pattern geometry to synthesize a
printer image, the method comprising:


developing a halftone cell (200) of multiple pixels arranged to form
a spatially asymmetric spot growth area having a dominant length

dimension;
darkening the pixels to achieve spot growth generally along the
length of the cell (200) and thereby a perceived monotonic darkening of

the cell (200); and

   characterized in that

a plurality of halftone cells are arranged to form a super-cell
structure, having a geometry that distributes row and column artifacts

along three axes of symmetry, thereby minimizing low frequency
artifacts.
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the halftone cell (200)

includes first and second terminal pixels and in which the darkening of
the cell is accomplished by initially darkening the first terminal pixel and

then progressively darkening pixels from the first terminal pixel to the
second terminal pixel.
A method as claimed in claim 2 in which the darkening
of the cell begins at a medial pixel positioned medially of first and

second terminal pixels of the halftone cell (200) and progresses
outwardly from the medial pixel toward the first and second terminal

pixels.
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 in which the
super-cell structure (210) is one in which a majority of the halftone cells

(200) are arranged so that their lengths are positioned adjacent one
another. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 in which a super-cell structure
(210) has opposed super-cell boundaries, each boundary defined by the

length of a halftone cell (200), and in which multiple super-cell
structures (210) are tessellated to form a super-cell pattern

characterized in that only one halftone cell (200) of the first super-cell
structure (210) is positioned between one of the boundaries of a second

(220) and one of the boundaries of a third halftone cell (200).
A method as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5 in which each of the
halftone cells (200) in a super-cell structure (210) includes first and

second terminal pixels, and in which multiple super-cell structures (250,
252, 254) are tessellated to form a super-cell pattern characterized by a

positioning of first and second terminal pixels of the halftone cells (200)
of the first super-cell structure (210) are positioned adjacent none of the

first and second terminal pixels of the halftone cells of the second super-cell
structure (252), and different first terminal pixels of the halftone

cells (200) of a third super-cell structure (254) are positioned adjacent at
least two second terminal pixels of the halftone cells (200) of each of

the first and second super-cell structures (250, 252).
A method as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6 in which each of
the halftone cells (200) includes first and second terminal pixels and the

super-cell structure (210) is arranged so that there is no side-by-side
spatial relationships between corresponding first and second terminal

pixels of adjacent cells (200).
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in which the super-cell
structure (210) defines substantially a hexagonal grid.
The method as claimed in any preceding claim in which the
darkening of the halftone cells (200) constituting a super-cell structure 

(210) is characterized by a visitation order defined by a
sequence of darkening one pixel in each of the cells of the super-cell

structure (210) before darkening another pixel in a cell (200) prior to
completion of the sequence.
A method as claimed in claim 9 in which darkening is
accomplished by multiple repetitions of the darkening sequence.
