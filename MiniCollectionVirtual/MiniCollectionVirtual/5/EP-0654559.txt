<ABSTRACT>
An improved papermakers forming fabric (1) 
having two layers (12,15) of CMD yarns (21-44, 51-58) 

interwoven with a system of MD yarns (61-68) to form a 
multi-layer fabric (1). The paper support surface 

CMD yarn layer (12) has at least three times as many 
CMD yarns as the machine contact surface CMD yarn 

layer (15). The higher count of upper layer CMD 
yarns (21-44) provides an improved paper forming/carrying 

surface with improved drainage 
characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to papermakers fabrics. More
particularly, the present invention relates to forming fabrics
which are used to facilitate the initial formation of a paper web
during the manufacture of paper. Most particularly, the present
invention provides a double layer forming fabric having an upper
paper carrying/forming layer which has three or more times as
many cross machine direction yarns as the lower, machine side
layer.Papermaking machines transform an aqueous slurry of fibers
into a continuous paper web which can be processed for a variety
of end uses. Papermakers fabrics are employed throughout the
papermaking process to transport the web of paper as a continuous
sheet through the papermaking equipment. The papermakers fabrics
also act as a drive belt for the equipment.The paper making process starts in the forming section of
a papermaking machine where the aqueous slurry is deposited onto
a forming fabric having the desired characteristics for retaining
the fibers while allowing the water to pass through. The wet
paper web created by this process is then carried by a press
fabric through the press section where additional water is
removed by squeezing the paper web and fabric between two rolls.
The paper web is then carried through the drying section on a
dryer fabric to remove additional water through forced
evaporation. The design of papermakers fabrics used on each
section of a papermaking machine vary in accordance with
function.In the forming section of papermaking machines, the fibers
are retained and collected on the upper surface of a forming
fabric and formed into a paper sheet. The forming fabric must
have a fine mesh weave on the paper contact side in order to
avoid marking the paper and to support the fiber from the slurry. 
The fabric must also have good drainage characteristics for initial water
removal to facilitate paper formation. However, as previously noted, the
forming fabric also serves as a drive belt and is subjected to high tensile
loads in the machine direction and compressive or buckling loads in the
cross machine direction. Therefore, a single fine-mesh yarn system is not
suitable for use as a forming fabric.To combat the prior art problem, multi-layer forming fabrics
were developed with fine-mesh yarns on the paper forming surface to
facilitate paper formation, and larger yarns on the machine contact side to
provide strength and longevity.Multi-layer forming fabrics are known in the art. For
example: US Patent 4,709,732 discloses a dual layer

<CLAIMS>
An improved papermakers forming fabric of a type having two
layers of CMD yarns interwoven with a system of MD yarns to form a multi-layer

fabric which has a paper support surface and a machine contact
surface, the paper support surface CMD yarn layer having at least n times

as many yarns as the number of yarns in the machine contact surface CMD
yarn layer in which n is an integer greater than 2, characterised by:-

a weave repeat wherein all of the MD yarns weave with both
CMD yarn layers.
The fabric of claim 1 wherein said upper layer CMD yarns
have a smaller diameter than said lower layer CMD yarns.
The fabric of claim 1 wherein said repeat pattern comprises
eight lower CMD yarns and twenty-four upper CMD yarns interwoven with

eight MD yarns.
The fabric of claim 1 wherein each MD yarn passes over
three non-adjacent upper layer CMD yarns that are separated from each

other by at least three adjacent upper layer CMD yarns, and under two
non-adjacent lower CMD yarns within a given repeat.
The fabric of claim 1 wherein said repeat pattern comprises
eight lower CMD yarns and thirty-two upper CMD yarns interwoven with

eight MD yarns.
The fabric of claim 1 wherein said lower layer CMD yarns are
uniformly arranged in general alignment with an upper CMD layer yarn and

spaced from each other by an upper layer yarn count of approximately n -1.
