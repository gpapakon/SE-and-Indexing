<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process for eliminating the 
organic compounds from aqueous effluents having a chemical 

oxygen demand (COD) greater than 5 g/l. 
The process consists of treating the effluents with a 
sufficient quantity of light energy originating from a 

polychromatic UV source in the presence of H₂O₂. The quantity 
of oxygen provided by the hydrogen peroxide expressed in grams 

per litre is between 0.5 and 3 times the COD of the effluent 
to be treated and the pH is equal to or less than 10.5. 
This process applies to photographic effluents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for treating
liquid effluents containing organic compounds which it is
desired to destroy before discharging them into the drains.
Liquid effluents is taken to mean all kinds of waste water
of industrial origin. This process applies particularly
well to liquid photographic effluents in aqueous solution
originating from the processing of films and photographic
papers.There are many works on the treatment of liquid effluents,
such as color photographic development baths or solutions,
the majority using peroxides, hydrogen peroxide or
activated carbon.For example, the French application registered under the No
9203562 and filed on 19 March 1992 can be cited, which
concerns a process comprising two oxidation stages
respectively in an alkaline medium and in a neutral medium
and a subsequent absorption treatment.Although this process is very effective in reducing the COD
(chemical oxygen demand expressed in g O2/l of solution) of
photographic effluents, it would be desirable to find new
processes which are simpler to use, preferably in a single
stage and in which the formation of additional salts
consequent upon readjustments of the pH would be avoided.Thus one of the objects of the present invention is to
reduce the COD of aqueous effluents by means of a simple
and effective process in which the action of hydrogen
peroxide is combined with ultraviolet radiation.It is known that the combined action of UV radiation and 
H2O2 may be combined to eliminate small quantities of
oxidizable matter in polluted water.For example, the French patent application 2303766
describes the elimination of cyanides or phenols from
polluted water by means of a treatment combining UV
radiation and H2O2. In order to eliminate cyanides,
preferably a high-pressure mercury lamp with a power of
450 W is used, the process is carried out at pH of 9.5 and
with a hydrogen peroxide concentration such that the
H2O2/CN ratio is less than 1. In order to eliminate the
phenols from water comprising 100 ppm of phenol, the
process is carried out at a pH of 6 to 8 and with a low-pressure
mercury lamp with a power of 15 W.An article by H M Castrantas and R D Gibilisco,
published in Chapter 6 pages 77-99 of the Journal of the
American Chemical Society 1990, summarises the known uses
of hydrogen peroxide for destroying pollutants such as
phenol compounds at concentrations of between 100 and 1000
ppm. According to this article, the UV/H2O2 combination
is much more effective in destroying phenols and
