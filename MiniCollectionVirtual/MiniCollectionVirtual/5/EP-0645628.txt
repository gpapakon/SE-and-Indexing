<ABSTRACT>
Described is a detection method of a pyrethroid 
compound which comprises providing a first antibody 

against the pyrethroid compound, said first antibody 
having been obtained by immunizing a responder with an 

immunogen which is a first conjugate between a first 
carrier and a first haptenic compound represented by 

the following formula (1) or (2): 

mixing the first antibody with the sample solution,
 

   causing any unreacted portion of the first 
antibody to be bound on a second conjuga
te as a coated 
antigen, said second conjugate being formed of a second 

carrier and a second haptenic compound and having been 
coated on a surface of a solid phase carrier, whereby  

 
an antigen-antibody conjugate is obtained; and

 
   reacting the antigen-antibody conjugate with a 

second antibody against the first antibody, said second 
antibody having a labelled enzyme linked therewith. 
This invention has made it possible to conduct 
easy, economical and quick analysis of a pyrethroid 

compound contained in our surroundings such as water or 
soil, plants or foods.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antibody capable of
undergoing specific linkage with a pyrethroid compound,
a novel compound useful as a hapten for the preparation
of the antibody (which may hereinafter be called a
"haptenic compound"),
an immunogen composed of the haptenic compound
and a method for the
detection and measurement of one or more pyrethroid
compounds in a sample by the use of the antibody.As immunochemical analyses of pyrethroid compounds,
there are "Study on Antibodies specific to S-Bioallethrin"
[J. Agric. Food Chem., 26, 1328-1333(1978)]
and "Radioimmunoassay" [Experimentia, 35,
1619-1620(1679)], both reported by B.D. Hammock et al.
These are fundamental studies on the application of an 
immunochemical analysis to a specific pyrethroid.There is also a report by L. H. Stanker et al. of
a basic study on the immunochemical analysis of
permethrin in meat [J. Agric. Food Chem., 37, 834-839(1989)].
According to the report, three monoclonal
antibodies were isolated by oxidizing dimethylvinyl
groups of phenothrin with ozone into a carboxylic acid
derivative, binding the derivative with a protein to
obtain a hapten-protein conjugate and immunizing a
responder with the conjugate. These antibodies, however,
are only useful for the detection of phenothrin,
permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin and have very
low detection sensitivity to other synthetic
pyrethoids. When an antibody is reacted to a compound
to be detected; a water-soluble organic solvent such as
acetonitrile is added to increase the solubility of the
compound in a sample so'that the compound is rendered
more reactive. In consideration of the stability of
the antibody against the organic solvent, the concentration
of the solvent must be controlled low, that
is, at 6% or lower, leading to the unresolved problems
that compounds having extremely low water solubility
can hardly be detected and solvent removal or concentration
is indispensable similarly to other micro-analyses. WO 90/10450 discloses a competition ELISA for the detection of a pyrethroid compound. A
first monoclonal antibody is provided by immunizing a responder with a conjugate between
the carrier KLH or BSA and the phenothrin hapten and subsequent hybridoma production.
The antibody is mixed with the sample solution and added to wells which are coated with
antigen. The antigen can be the same phenothrin-BSA conjugate as used for the
immunization. Detection of the antibodies bound to the well-coating antigens is performed by
a second enzyme-linked antibody. The antibodies of
