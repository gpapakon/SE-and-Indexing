<ABSTRACT>
The radius of curvature of the end portion of the block 
of a tire at the equatorial plane side of the tire is the 

same as the radius of the tire thereat. On the other hand, 
the radius of curvature of the end portion of the block at 

the shoulder side is smaller than the radius of the tire 
thereat, and the point which protrudes furthest is between 

the center and the trailing edge portion of the block 16. 
The shape of the radially outward surface of the block 

protrudes further toward the shoulder side end portion, 
which is an area in which the wear of the leading edge 

portion progresses furthest. The ground contact pressure at 
the shoulder side becomes even lower. Accordingly, the 

leading edge portion can smoothly slide against the road 
surface. As a result, the progress of the wear from the 

leading edge portion is promoted, and the effect of 
preventing the heel-and-toe wear becomes higher.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tire
having a block pattern, and in particular to a pneumatic
tire having a good effect of preventing heel-and-toe wear.In a pneumatic tire having a block pattern, given that
the radius of curvature of the block having a cross section,
in which the block surface is orthogonal to a rotational
axis of the tire, is equal to the radius of the outer
circumference of the tire, the ground contact pressure of a
leading edge portion and the ground contact pressure of a
trailing edge portion are the same until wear occurs.
When the wear occurs at a trailing edge portion of the
block, the ground contact pressures become different as
shown in Fig. 10
of the accompanying drawings.
As a result, irregular wear called
heel-and-toe wear occurs. When the heel-and-toe wear
occurs, not only is the outer appearance of the tire
deteriorated but also the gripping ability of the tire is
reduced.In order to prevent the heel-and-toe wear, it has been
proposed in Japanese Utility Model Application Laid-Open No.
60-105208 that the leading edge portion side of the 
block is formed so as to smoothly slide against the road
surface and the wear of the leading edge portion side is
promoted so as to delay the occurrence of the heel-and-toe
wear. However, depending on circumstances, there is a
drawback in that the irregular wear progresses even further.The heel-and-toe wear usually progresses as illustrated
in Fig. 11
of the accompanying drawings.
The amount of wear is smaller toward the
leading edge portion and larger toward the trailing edge
portion. In order to prevent the heel-and-toe wear, it
suffices if the wear is made small at the trailing edge
portion and if the wear is made large at the leading edge
portion. On the basis of this idea, as illustrated in Figs.
6 and 12 thereof, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-166304
proposes a pneumatic tire in which the outer contour of the
block, which has a cross section orthogonal to the
rotational axis of the tire, is formed in the shape of an
arc so that the outer contour of the block is smaller than
the contour of the outer diameter of the tire. By promoting
the wear of the leading edge portion, the occurrence of
heel-and-toe wear can be delayed.However, a drawback arises in that
the effect of promoting the wear of the leading edge
portion side may be small depending on the shape of the block
surface.In addition, when the wear progresses to the period 
between the intermediate stages and final stages of wear,
even if the block has
