<ABSTRACT>
A multi-color ink-jet printing system includes a printing element (20) for 
applying a precisely metered quantity of a colorless precursor in a binary or 

ternary chemical reaction to a precisely defined printing location on a 
recording medium surface (13). The precursor conditions the medium 

surface (13) prior to application of one or more colorants (12, 14, 16, 18) to 
the recording medium surface (13) to prevent recording medium cockle and 

curl, and to reduce dry time, while conditioning the recording medium surface 
(13) for uniform dot gain independent of media composition. The precursor 

also immobilizes the colorants on the recording medium surface (13) to 
enable one-pass, multi-color printing, while eliminating color bleed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink jet printers. More particularly, the present
invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing consistent, high
quality, multi-color ink jet printing having variable print density on any of various
media.Since the introduction of ink jet printing technology, the accepted solutions to
the problems of feathering, dot gain, recording medium cockle and curl, and
color bleed with single-part inks have included optimizing the formulation to
the extent possible, minimizing the rate at which ink is printed on the
recording medium, and adding energy to the ink either before or after printing
to accomplish a complete or partial phase change. Such phase change
includes both liquid-solid and liquid-vapor transitions, as well as significant
changes in solubility and viscosity. In both of the foregoing methods, the
print quality ("PQ") dependence on medium surface characteristics remains
the same because the desired ink phase change does not occur rapidly
enough to prevent some colorant migration on the surface of the recording
medium, usually paper or transparency film. Thus, printing characteristic and
resulting print quality varies from medium to medium.So called tiling algorithms have been used to minimize the amount of ink
applied to the medium and thus avoid somewhat color-to-color bleed and
paper cockle and curl. Such tiling algorithms control the amount of ink
applied during printing to produce a depleted matrix on each pass of a
scanning printhead. A solid area fill is thereby eventually built up only after
several passes of the printhead. In this way, the medium is not saturated
during any one printing pass, and the medium is allowed to dry partially
during the interval between printing passes. However, such tiling algorithms slow the printing process, resulting in a
significant throughput penalty and cannot easily be applied to page-wide
array printing, which is adapted to single-pass, multicolor printing. The
throughput penalty of tiling schemes seriously degrades printer performance
when the printer is used for color printing, where several printing passes must
be made for each of several colors. Such performance degradation is
especially pronounced when the throughput achieved for color printing is
compared to the throughput achieved for black-only printing: usually a 3:1 or
4:1 time penalty is realized (color print time: black print time).The addition of energy to the printing process by heating the recording
medium immediately before and/or during printing

A method for applying binary or ternary
ink jet ink chemistry to a plurality of pixel locations on a recording medium surface for a multi-color ink jet printer having a separate ink printhead (12,14,16,18)

applying a colorless precursor to said recording medium surface (13) at each
pixel location on said recording medium surface using at least one separate ink

printhead to condition the recording medium surface at each pixel location prior to
application of colored ink to said pixel location;
applying a colored ink to each of said conditioned pixel locations;
wherein the quantity of said ink precursor applied is minimized because the
quantity of said ink precursor applied to said recording medium is precisely controlled

and the size of said resulting conditioned area on said recording medium is precisely
controlled, such that said ink precursor is delivered only to those areas of said

recording medium where they are used;
wherein said precursor and said colored ink react, thereby confining the ink to
the pixel location defined by said precursor and thereby immediately immobilizing said

colored ink at said pixel location, the method being characterized by
detecting how much of said precursor is available for conditioning the recording
medium; and
switching said printer into a multipass tiling printing mode when an insufficient
quantity of said precursor remains to condition said recording medium surface.

performing at each pixel location a logical-OR on all data in a printer swath
memory (30) for each color of said multiple of color inks to determine which colored
