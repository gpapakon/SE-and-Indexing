<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is disclosed for adaptively 
controlling the biasing current applied to magnetoresistive 

(MR) read heads (10a,10b,10c,10d) 
within a magnetic disk drive to provide 

optimized bias for each head/disk/channel component 
combination. An optimized bias current for each head is 

ascertained and stored on the disk surface at the time of 
manufacture. During each power up operation the values are 

transferred to random access memory which is accessed 
during the execution of each head switch command to apply 

bias current in accordance with the optimized value to the 
active MR head. Periodic reoptimization and updating of 

the stored values is effected by general error measurement 
circuitry (GEM) 

that forms a part of the device control system 
and is invoked to perform the reoptimization upon the 

occurrence of an event such as a predetermined duration of 
power on operation subsequent to the last reoptimization 

procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to magnetic storage
devices using magnetoresistive (MR) transducer head
elements and more particularly to the control of biasing
current for enhancing the performance of such transducer
elements.The dimensions of an MR head are becoming smaller and
the tolerances are not reducing as quickly as the
dimensions. In the design of a typical recent device, the
tolerances on the MR stripe height represent a +/- 33%
change, or with respect to the ratio of the highest to the
lowest, represents a 2:1 ratio. Further, the tolerance of
the width of the MR stripe (length in the direction of
current flow) is +/- 20%. The tolerance of the thickness
is +/- 10%. If these are considered independent
variations, the total variation in the resistance of the
element is about +/- 40%, or a high to low ratio of 2.33:1.A problem resulting from the large dimensional
variability is that with the normal biasing method, a large
difference in power dissipation occurs with different heads
within a device. In addition, current density varies
significantly as the cross-section for the current (stripe
height by thickness) also varies by a large amount. The
basic failure mechanism is considered to be
electromigration. Product life is inversely related to the
cube of the current density, and exponentially to 
temperature (hot being bad). Since the normal biasing
method uses a DC current that is fixed for all heads, the
low stripe heights and thin layer thickness result in
higher resistance and higher current density. The
resulting power dissipation causes significantly more
temperature rise than associated with a high and thick
stripe. Thus temperature and current density compound and
cause a much shorter life expectancy for the low stripe
height and thin MR elements, compared to the higher and
thicker elements.Another consideration is that all the factors that
make the resistance higher also make the the signal level
higher. Thus the best signal to noise ratio occurs with
the highest resistance heads. Thus, low stripe heights,
thin layers and wider stripes cause good signal to noise
ratios, while high, thick and narrow stripes produce poorer
signal to noise ratios. A fixed bias current must then be
a compromise between good signal and short life.Another problem is that a good electronic signal to
noise ratio depends upon preamplifier design. Preamplifier
design has significant limits due to the reduction of
voltage available and reduced power goals. Present designs
typically have a single +5 volt supply (+/-
