<ABSTRACT>
An intravascular puncturing nozzle with an automatic 
no blood reflux mechanism. The mechanism comprises a part 

(3) drawn by resilient means towards a position closing 
the passage (6) of the plastic nozzle (2), which position 

is automatically reached when the needle (4) puncturing 
the blood vessel is removed from such passage. The 

connector (5) on the serum equipment automatically opens 
the passage (6) when the said equipment is connected. 
The mechanism is applicable to intravascular 
puncturing nozzles to prevent the patient's blood from 

refluxing and coming into contact with the operator, 
thereby avoiding contagion, and in order not to put the 

sterility of the material used at stake.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an intravascular 
puncturing nozzle with an automatic no blood reflux 
mechanism which, in addition to the function for which it 
is designed, affords a number of advantages discussed 
hereinafter, and others that are inherent in its 
organisation and construction. Existing intravascular nozzles or catheters, being 
the prior art, comprise a plastic material tube with an 
end designed to be housed within the punctured blood 
vessel and its other end connecting with a serum 
equipment via a "Luer-Lock" system. Running along the 
inside of the nozzle is the needle allowing puncture and 
fitted at its far end with a receptacle which being 
filled indicates that the needle is correctly positioned 
within the blood vessel. Once the blood vessel has been punctured the needle 
is removed and the plastic nozzle is inserted until it 
reaches its definitive position. The serum equipment is 
finally connected at the end of the nozzle via the so-called 
"Luer-Lock" system. This latter operation, even if carried out skilfully 
and at great speed, usually entails the outlet of drops 
or indeed greater quantities of blood. This means that 
the operator will come into contact with the patient's 
blood and hence there will clearly be a risk of 
contamination and contagion if the patient carries any  
 
infectious diseases (hepatitis, AIDS, and so forth). In 
any event, even if there are no chances of contagion, the 
need to clean the area stained by the refluxing blood 
will always be a problem and the sterility of the 
material used will moreover be at stake. The applicants for this Patent of Invention have 
devised an intravascular puncturing nozzle fitted with an 
automatic mechanism designed to prevent blood reflux, in 
order to correct the disadvantages and problems set out 
above, stemming from the use of currently known 
conventional nozzles. The mechanism is constructed to allow its being 
housed within the cone of the plastic nozzle, viz. at the 
end connecting with the serum equipment. Broadly speaking, the mechanism comprises a part 
that is drawn by resilient means towards a closed 
position blocking the passage in the plastic nozzle. In 
accordance with the above, when the needle is removed the 
said part closes the said passage and prevents the blood 
from refluxing. The opposition of the said resilient 
means is automatically overcome when the serum equipment 
is connected, allowing administration to the patient. The nozzle subject of the present Patent of 
Invention
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
1.- An intravascular puncturing nozzle with an 
automatic no blood reflux mechanism of the kind having a 

plastic tube material fitted with an end designed to be 
housed within the punctured blood vessel and with its 

other end connecting with a serum equipment, the inner 
part of the nozzle having the needle allowing puncture 

and fitted at its far end with a receptacle showing that 
the needle is correctly positioned in the blood vessel, 

essentially characterised by comprising a mechanism 
housed within the cone (1) of the plastic nozzle (2), 

comprised at least by a part (3) drawn by conventional 
resilient means towards a closed position of the gate or 

passage area (6) of the plastic nozzle, which position is 
automatically reached when the needle is removed, 

preventing the blood from refluxing, being automatically 
removed from such position to open when the serum 

equipment is connected, overcoming the opposition of the 
resilient means due to the presence of the connector (5). 
2.- An intravascular puncturing nozzle with an 
automatic no blood reflux mechanism, as in claim 1, 

characterised in that the passage (6) or gate area 
includes a fine plastic coaxial tube preventing the blood 

from coming into contact with the closing part (3). 
3.- An intravascular puncturing nozzle with an 
automatic no blood reflux mechanism, as in claim 1, 

characterised in that the portion (7) of the part (3) 
performing the blocking function as such for the blood 

flow, has an absorbing material coating.
