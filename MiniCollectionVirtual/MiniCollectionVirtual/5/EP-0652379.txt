<ABSTRACT>
An anchor assembly (10) and an anchoring method according to 
the present invention is developed to simplify the exchanging 

work of the fixed anchor assembly. For attaining this object, 
the anchor assembly (10) is provided with a lock assembly (4) divided 

into an upper half portion (4) and a lower half portion (3) by taking an 
acutely cut surface (12) as a boundary, and the lock assembly (4) is 

shaped in hollow cylindrical fashion, and the rod portion (6) 
provided with a threaded portion (7) on the upper end is inserted in 

the lock assembly (4). Together with providing an axial clearance 
between each of the internal peripheral surfaces of the upper (2) 

and lower (3) half portions and the internal peripheral surface of a 
hole destined to lock anchor assembly (4), the rod portion (6) is so 

constructed as to be provided with a nut (9) for fastening the lock 
assembly (4) and a stopper portion (8) for preventing the dropping out 

of the lock assembly (4) from the rod portion (6). An anchoring method 
according to the present invention is comprised with a method 

for expanding each of the acutely shaped edges of the upper (2) and 
lower portions (3) towards the internal peripheral surface of the 

hole in order to anchor the anchor assembly (10) and a method for 
returning the expanded portion to the original position by 

releasing the axially loaded force in order to easily remove the 
anchor assembly (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an anchor assembly and 
an anchoring method for fixing the anchor assembly, in 
particular relating to an anchor assembly and an anchoring 
method enabling simplification of an exchange work in 
installing apparatus or temporary structures. As known, anchor assemblies are widely used as 
methods for fixing miscellaneous apparatus or board 
materials into concrete or mortar layers. Up to now, as a first example of a conventional 
anchor, Figure 38 of the accompanying drawings shows an 
anchor 30 having plural stepped blades 31a on a main body 
31 shaped as a round bar. In detail, the blades 31a are 
shaped so as to form upwardly orientated acute angled 
edges 31c by having plural tapered surfaces 31b expanding 
from the centre of the main body 31 towards the external 
diameter thereof separated by crosswise cut grooves 31e. 
A pin hole 31d is formed in the core from the upper end of 
the body 31. A taper pin 32 is inserted in the bottom 
portion of the pin hole 31. A stud bolt 33 is threaded in 
the upper end of the anchor 30 for fastening the 
instrument or the board material in the concrete layer 16 
by applying a nut 35 through a washer. With this anchor 30, when driving the anchor 30 
in the cut concrete hole 11, the taper pin 32 inserted in 
the bottom portion of the anchor 30 is driven into the pin 
hole 31d. Accordingly, each of the blades 31a separated 
by the grooves 31e expands in the concrete hole 11, and 
each of the acutely angled edges 31c of the blades 31a 
bites into the peripheral surface lla of the concrete hole 
11 fastening the anchor assembly 30. However, the anchor 
assembly 30 was apt to be eccentrically intruded into the 
concrete hole 11 depending on the driving condition and to 
become unstable owing to the uneven frictional resistance  
 
producing the resisting force against the extracting 
direction. Furthermore, it was difficult subsequently to 
extract the driven anchor assembly 30 owing to the 
resisting force of the acutely angled edges 31c of the 
blades 31a biting into the peripheral surface 11a of the 
concrete hole 11. A second example anchor is shown in Japanese 
Utility Model number Sho 61-193149 and in Figures 39 to 
41, that anchor assembly is separated into an upper half 
portion 21a and a lower half portion 21b by being cut so 
as to shape an acute angle ϑ at the bottom portion of an 
elongate bar-like steel material having a total length as 
much as 40 to 50 times its diameter, and being provided 
with a welded or bonded portion 23a

<CLAIMS>
An anchor assembly having a lower end for 
insertion into a hole and an upper end, and provided with 

a lock assembly comprising an upper half portion and a 
lower half portion divided by a cut as a boundary, 

characterised in that 
   said lock assembly is hollow and contains means 

extending from the upper end and operable therefrom to 
radially expand the lock assembly at the cut. 
An anchor assembly according to claim 1, 
wherein said means is operable to axially compress said 

first and second portions to provide said expansion. 
An anchor assembly according to claim 1 or 
2, wherein said means comprises a rod portion extending 

inside said lock assembly. 
An anchor assembly according to claim 3, 
wherein a clearance is provided between internal 

peripheries of said upper and lower portions and the 
external periphery of said rod portion. 
An anchor assembly according to claim 3 or 
4, further comprising: 

   a nut engaged with a threaded portion provided 
on said rod portion at its upper end; and 

   a stopper portion provided on the bottom portion 
of said rod portion for retaining said locking assembly on 

said rod portion. 
An anchor assembly according to claim 3, 4 
or 5, wherein said lower half portion is characterised by 

being provided with an internal thread for engaging with 
said threaded rod portion. 
An anchor assembly according to any 
preceding claim, comprising plural lock assemblies each 

having a respective upper half portion and lower half 
portion and wherein each boundary surface between 

neighbouring assemblies is substantially perpendicular to 
the axis of the anchor assembly. 
A releasable anchoring method comprising a 
step of inserting an anchor assembly according to any one 

of the preceding claims, into an anchor hole; axially 
urging said upper half portion and said lower half portion 

towards each other to create expansion in opposite radial 
directions along said acutely cut section through a range 

of axial clearance defined between each of the internal 
peripheral surfaces of said upper and lower half portions, 

and the internal peripheral of said hole, after axial 
movements of said upper and lower half parts cease; and 

releasing said anchor by letting said upper and lower half 
portions return to the original positions by releasing the 

axial force applied to said half portions to enable said 
anchor assembly to be extracted from said hole. 
An anchoring method according to claim 8, 
wherein said step for axially urging said upper half 

portion and said lower half portion toward each other is 
achieved by engaging said lower half portion with a 

threaded portion of said means and forcing it to move in 
the range of said axial clearance defined between the 

external peripheral surface of said lower half portion and 
said internal periphery of said anchor hole bored into the 

object destined to fix said anchor assembly.
