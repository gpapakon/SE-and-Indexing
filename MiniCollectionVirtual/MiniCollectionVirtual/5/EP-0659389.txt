<ABSTRACT>
An endoprosthesis for implantation in vessels of the human or animal body is designed as a tubular framework of filaments which are arranged in a helical line configuration and which form two entwined groups which run in opposite senses of rotation and in each case consist of a plurality of mutually twisted filaments. Each filament has a composite material (2) with continuous reinforcement fibres (4) made of high-strength inorganic material, preferably carbon, glass or Kevlar, which are embedded in a support material (3) made of a high-strength thermoplastic, preferably polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or polyether sulphone (PS). The composite material (2) can be surrounded by a sleeve (5) which is preferably made of material corresponding to the support material (3), but which can contain admixtures, for example medicaments. In order to accommodate medicaments or other active substances, the sleeve (5) can be designed to be porous. An X-ray contrast medium may be admixed to the material of the sleeve or the support material. To produce the composite material (2), the reinforcement fibres (4) are covered with support material in powder form and are pulled through a heated die - pultruded. The sleeve (5) can then be applied to the composite material (2) in a similar manner. In order to generate a porous structure, a granular and soluble material such as salt can be admixed with the sleeve material and is then washed out.

Endoprosthesis for use in vessels of the human or
animal body, with a tubular latticework made of

flexurally rigid elastic filaments (1), which
endoprosthesis is made up of a core element of high

tensile strength and of a shell (5) which surrounds the
core element and does not substantially alter the tensile

strength of the filament, the shell (5) being designed to
receive active substances, characterized in that the core

element consists of a composite material (2), the
composite material (2) being made up of a plurality of

elements (4) in each case of high tensile strength,
which, for the purpose of achieving a high flexural

rigidity of the filament, are sheathed by a support
material (3) of low tensile strength, and the shell (5)

is anchored unreleasably on the support material (3).
Endoprosthesis according to Claim 1,
characterized in that both the support material (3) and

the material of the shell (5) each contain a
thermoplastic, and in that the thermoplastic of the

support material (3) is melted onto the filament surface
and melted together with the thermoplastic of the shell

material.
Endoprosthesis according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the shell (5) contains the same

thermoplastic as the support material (3). 
Endoprosthesis according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the support material or shell

material (3, 5) is prepared from a mixture of substances
which contains an X-ray contrast medium.
Endoprosthesis according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the material lying on the filament

exterior is prepared from a mixture of substances which
contains a medicament effective in the human or animal

body.
Endoprosthesis according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the support material (3) has an

especially large surface area, on which the shell (5) is
anchored.
Endoprosthesis according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the material lying on the filament

exterior has pores in which a medicament effective in the
human or animal body is incorporate
d.
Process for manufacturing an endoprosthesis
according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in that

to manufacture a filament (1), support material in powder
form is applied to elements of high tensile strength (4),

and these are then drawn through a heated die, and then
shell material in powder form is applied to the already

shaped filament (1) and this is then drawn through a
further heated die.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in
that, prior to the application, a soluble granular

substance is admixed with the material lying in each case
on the filament exterior, and after drawing through the

heated die, this substance is washed out of the filament
exterior by means of a solvent.
