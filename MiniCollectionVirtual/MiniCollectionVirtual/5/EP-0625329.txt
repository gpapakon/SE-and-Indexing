<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cleaning device with a base body (1) which comprises a handle (4) and a holding device (8) for receiving a liquid-absorbing element (9) for moistening an object to be wiped and has a mount (5) for a wiping-off element (6) for clearing the object so as to dry the latter. The invention is distinguished in that the holding device (8) is arranged between the mount (5) and the handle (4) in such a way that, by changing the inclination of the base body (1) with respect to the object, the latter can be either moistened or cleared by the cleaning device, it being possible for the removed moisture to be absorbed by the liquid-absorbing element (9) in one clearing position of the cleaning device.
