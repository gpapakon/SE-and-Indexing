<ABSTRACT>
A method, and apparatus for performing the method, 
of detecting excessive core set film curl of a filmstrip 

wound within a film cartridge (10) of the type having a light 
trapping film slit (12) through which the leading end (28) of the 

filmstrip may be advanced or retracted, whereby excessively 
curled filmstrips may be pre-sorted prior to photofinishing 

operations. The method and apparatus comprises the steps 
of and means for positioning the film cartridge (10) with the 

light trapping slit (12) thereof oriented in a predetermined 
position,

 
unwinding the leading end (28) of the filmstrip a predetermined 

distance out of the light trapping slit of the film 
cartridge, whereby the unwound leading end (28) of the filmstrip 

may freely curl back in the direction in which the 
filmstrip is wound within the film cartridge to the extent 

that the filmstrip exhibits core set film curl, and 
detecting an excessive degree of core set film curl by the 

amount to which the unwound leading end of the filmstrip 
curls back toward the film cartridge (10). In a preferred 

embodiment, a deflector mechanism is formed with a first 
slot (32) for receiving normally curled filmstrips unwound the 

predetermined distance and a second slot (38) for receiving 
excessively curled filmstrips advanced the predetermined 

distance. The deflector mechanism has deflector surfaces (36) 
formed in relation to the first slot for deflecting the 

leading end of the filmstrip evidencing a normal range of 
film curl into the first slot. The deflection of the 

leading end into the second slot (38) is detected by light 
emitting means (33) positioned for emitting light in a light 

beam extending across the width of the second slot; and 
light detecting means (35) positioned for detecting said light 

beam in the absence of a leading end of a filmstrip 
extending into said second slot and interrupting said light 

beam, whereby a signal indicative of excessively curled 
filmstrip may be generated. Thereafter, the leading end (28) 

may be rewound into the cartridge (10) and cartridges found to 
contain excessively curled filmstrips may be separated from 

those containing filmstrips exhibiting a normal range of 
core set film curl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to handling 
exposed photographic filmstrips during photofinishing, 
including processing and printing or mounting, and, more 
particularly, to sorting normally curled, exposed 
filmstrips suitable for normal splicing and transport from 
excessively core set filmstrips having a degree of film 
curl negatively affecting its ability to be spliced and 
transported, so that the excessively core set film may 
separately handled to ensure correct processing and 
printing or mounting. In typical 35 mm film cartridges, the filmstrip is 
withdrawn by its "film leader" from the cartridge and 
advanced past a rectangular exposure window or space gate 
and wound up on a take-up reel until all potential image 
frames of the filmstrip are exposed. In more recently 
proposed "thrust" cartridges, the filmstrip may be advanced 
out of the light trapping slit or mouth of the cartridge 
shell by rotating the film spool in an unwinding direction 
as described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
4,933,693, incorporated herein by reference in its 
entirety. Thus, in use, the cartridge may be loaded in the 
camera without any exposed leader protruding from the shell 
slit and advanced, after the camera film loading door is 
closed, by a motorized drive mechanism until the first 
image frame is positioned for exposure. The thrust 
cartridge avoids any unnecessary waste of the film leader 
and initial frames on loading into the camera. Moreover, 
it is contemplated that developed negative filmstrips may 
be returned to the customer wound back into the cartridge  
 
for safekeeping. In any case, the filmstrip is 
automatically or mechanically rewound into the film 
cartridge of either type upon exposure of all image frames, 
and the cartridge is removed for processing and printing or 
mounting, in the case of positive film. Before the filmstrip is completely exposed, it may 
reside tightly wound in the cartridge or partially unwound 
within the camera for a period of time and under varying 
conditions of temperature and humidity such that the film 
takes a "core set" affecting the degree to which the film 
curls back upon itself when unrestrained. When the 
filmstrip is originally manufactured and cut to length, it 
is generally fairly limp and relatively easy to maintain 
straight (because it is wound on a relatively large 
diameter core and maintained at 50 - 60 % relative 
humidity). After winding onto the core of the film 
cartridge, the innermost layers of the filmstrip wound 
around

Apparatus for detecting excessive core set 
film curl of an elongated filmstrip of a film cartridge 

having a light trapping film slit comprising: 
   means for positioning the film cartridge with the 

light trapping slit thereof oriented in a predetermined 
position; 

   means for unwinding the leading end of the 
filmstrip a predetermined distance out of the light 

trapping slit of the film cartridge, whereby the unwound 
leading end of the filmstrip may freely curl back in the 

direction in which the filmstrip is wound within the film 
cartridge to the extent that
 the filmstrip exhibits film

   means for detecting an excessive degree of film 
curl by the amount to which the unwound leading end of the 

filmstrip curls back toward the film cartridge.
