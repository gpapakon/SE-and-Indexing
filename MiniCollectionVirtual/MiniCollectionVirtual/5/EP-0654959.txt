<ABSTRACT>
A printed circuit board (20) includes vibration sensitive areas 
(50) where vibration sensitive components of an electrical 

circuit design fabricated on the printed circuit board (20) are 
mechanically isolated from supporting circuitry (55).The 

present invention provides a printed circuit board (20) with 
areas (50) having an increased natural resonant frequency of 

vibration for the circuit board area where the vibration 
sensitive circuit is located. The printed circuit board (20) 

comprises a number of slots, holes or other openings (40) around 
the vibration sensitive circuitry (50). In addition, one or 

more circuit board conductive paths (60) are provided for 
maintaining electrical conductivity between the isolated 

circuit (50) and the supporting circuits (55).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fabricating 
electrical circuits on printed circuit boards, and in 
particular to a method of manufacturing printed circuit 
boards so as to minimize the effects of external vibration 
sources on circuit components attached thereto.  A typical circuit design implemented on a printed 
circuit board contains parts such as transistors, 
resistors, capacitors and integrated circuits. Assembly 
of circuit designs on printed circuit boards is a favored 
industry practice because it permits low-cost production 
and easy maintenance. It is not unusual for a circuit design implemented 
on a printed circuit board to contain one or more vibration 
sensitive components, for example, a voltage controlled 
oscillator or resonant circuit, in addition to supporting 
circuitry. Furthermore, it is not unusual for a printed 
circuit board containing a vibration sensitive circuit or 
component to be placed in an environment that subjects the 
board to external vibration forces in an axis perpendicular 
to the plane of the board, for example, placement of the 
circuit board in an automobile or airplane. When oriented 
in this manner, external vibration forces can cause 
deflections in the circuit board that influence the 
operation of vibration sensitive components attached 
thereto. As the printed circuit board vibrates and deflects, 
a small part of the shunt capacitance between the circuit 
component leads and the ground plane varies in concert with  
 
the vibrational motion. Board deflection and the 
associated shunt capacitance variation are most severe at 
or near the natural resonance frequency of the printed 
circuit board. As is well known, this variation in shunt 
capacitance often causes a corresponding variation in the 
output oscillation frequency of vibration sensitive 
components or resonant circuits mounted to the vibrating 
circuit board. Local oscillators used in telecommunications 
equipment are most susceptible to the effects of circuit 
board vibration and deflection. Deviations in the local 
frequency of oscillation caused by shunt capacitance 
variation resulting from circuit board vibration and 
deflection corrupts the output spectrum of the local 
oscillator. Corruption of this kind is known as incidental 
frequency modulation and manifests itself as phase jitter 
when measuring data signals. In conclusion, variable shunt 
capacitance effects from vibrating and deflecting circuit 
boards can render sophisticated and important vibration 
sensitive circuitry unusable
