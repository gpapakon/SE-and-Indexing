<ABSTRACT>
An electroluminescent light and an intrinsically safe lighting system for use in hazardous areas. The light has controlled dielectric strength and capacitance, which when matched with the low current and voltage from an intrinsically safe power supply, and the controlled capacitance of each lighting circuit, produces an emergency lighting system which is both safe and effective.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EL LIGHTS AND EMERGENCY LIGHTING SYSTEM FOR HAZARDOUS AREASINTRODUCTION This invention relates generally to electroluminescent ("EL") lights and an emergency lighting system, particularly for marking an exit path, for use in explosive, flammable and other hazardous areas. This system combines a power source capable of providing AC power of controlled voltage and current to a system of two or more parallel EL lighting circuits of controlled capacitance, providing both an assurance of spark-free, low temperature operation and adequate- brightness for emergency use.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONProviding adequate illumination in hazardous work areas, particularly explosive or flammable work areas, has been difficult to accomplish with adequate safety. Most lighting systems utilize circuitry with an inherent spark potential, operate at high temperatures, or both. In addition, large area or long-length lighting systems commonly require power inputs which create the hazard of fire or explosion in these unique environments. This is true for both ambient lighting and emergency lighting. While daylight operation can be an adequate answer to the former, emergency lighting must operate at all times and in adverse atmospheres (smoke, fog, etc.), and hence creates special difficulties. 

 Certain metering and other devices for use in hazardous areas have used what is commonly known as "intrinsically safe" ("IS") circuitry and equipment, where low power input is adequate, such as about one watt or less. IS systems call for the use of low capacitance, current and voltage for safety reasons. Components and circuitry of this type are provided, for example, by the MTL Group of Luton England, but such systems have not been favored for use in lighting systems as acceptable light sources were not available.EL lights have been used for exit path marking systems, such as those provided by Loctite Luminescent Systems, Inc. , Lebanon, N.H. , U.S.A. but have not been used in hazardous environments where the potential for explosions due to electrical sparks has existed. To provide adequate brightness and lit area for effectiveness, EL systems call for the use of high capacitance and voltage.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAccording to the invention herein, it has been found that a specific construction and arrangement of EL lighting circuits can be used in conjunction with a carefully constructed and controlledIS power source to make available an emergency lighting system capable of use in flammable, explosive or like hazardous
