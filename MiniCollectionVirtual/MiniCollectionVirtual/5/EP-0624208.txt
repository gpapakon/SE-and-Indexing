<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of yarn by the
false twist texturing method in which a multistrand synthetic
yarn is given a false twist and heated to "texture" or "bulk"
the yarn. Among other advantages "texturing" improves the feel
of garments made from the yarn (see DE-A-3811437).Typically a very large machine is needed for texturing
yarn. This machine includes numerous similar portions,
sometimes as many as 216, in each of which yarn is textured.
The portions are known as "positions" and each position has a
supply of yarn to be textured, a texturing apparatus and a
take-up for the textured yarn. Each texturing apparatus is some
six metres high with heating and cooling zones some two to three
metres long and subject to varying ambient conditions. All the
positions are intended to operate at the same texturing
conditions and all are supplied with the same type of yarn. In
theory the whole machine will operate at the same conditions and
each position will produce yarn which is textured in the same
way. However, in such a large machine the conditions will not
always be the same from position to position and variations in
texturing are inevitable despite careful design and constant
attention to operation. In particular the heating arrangement
is inflexible and it is appropriate to classify such machines as
isothermal, also recognising the aim of an identical heat state
at each position. Despite the above developments the need for
more economic manufacture demands improvements above the speed
and quality now achieved. In particular the dyeability of the
yarn can vary due to inconsistency of yarn texturing input and
this can lead to the rejection and waste of much material. In EP-A-20143974 (Teijin Ltd) there are suggestions for an
isothermal method of producing textured polyester yarn in which
the heater length can be reduced to less than 1.8 metres.
Specifically a heater length of 0.65 to 0.70 metres with a yarn
speed of 400 metres per minute and a straight line path is
proposed. However the method requires a special heater called a
"non-touch" type with a bow shaped yarn path in which the yarn
is guided by plates with shaped slits to suppress a yarn
balloon. The heater temperature is from 300°C to 800°C. If the
yarn breaks in the heater it will be destroyed by the very high
temperature of the heater burning off the yarn. The very high
temperature is needed as heat is transferred to the yarn by
radiation in an open environment so heat loss is high. Because
the yarn must not touch the heater the

A method for texturing a yarn comprising

feeding the yarn under tension along a path from a source (YC) to
a take-up (YW) therefore along a path including a false twist zone

in which the yarn is heated and cooled whilst highly twisted;
controlling at least one processing parameter in the false twist zone;

   characterised in that said processing parameter is controlled in accordance
with the result of a measurement made on the yarn travelling along said path after leaving the false twist zone which

measurement is indicative of the effect of the texturising on the yarn.
A method according to claim 1, in which the measurement is indicative of
the dyeability of the texturised yarn.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, in which the measurement is
indicative of the bulk of the yarn.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in which measurement is
made on the yarn in tension-relaxed conditions between the false twist zone and the take-up

(YW).
A method according to claim 4, in which the tension relaxed yarn drives in
rotation a freely-rotatable drum (SD) the speed of which is sensed as the measurement.
A method according to claim 5, in which the speed is sensed
photoelectrically. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, in which measurement is
made on the yarn in the false twist zone.
A method according to claim 7, in which yarn temperature on leaving a yarn
heater (TH) is measured as an indication of heat take-up by the yarn.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 8, in which the measurement
is used to control the processing parameter in a closed-loop control system.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 9, in which the measurement
is used to control yarn heating.
A method according to claim 10, in which yarn heating is effected by direct
heat exchange with a hot fluid such as steam and/or air and the fluid temperature is

controlled in accordance with the measurement.
A method according to claim 11, in which the fluid is heated in main (H1)
and auxiliary (H2) heaters of which the auxiliary heater (H2) is controlled.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 12, in which the measurement
is used to control yarn tension in the false twist zone.
A method according to claim 13, in which yarn tension is controlled by
controlling the speed of at least one yarn feed roller, (FD, SD).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 14, in which the measurement
is used to control yarn twist level in the false twist zone. 
A method according to claim 15, in which the twist level is controlled by
controlling the speed of rotation of a rotary false twist device (TW).
Apparatus for texturing a yarn comprising:

a source (YC) for a supply of yarn and a take-up (YW) for textured
yarn and therebetween a yarn path including a twist zone including

yarn feed means (FD, SD) yarn heater means (TH), provision for
yarn cooling (TC) and a false twist device (TW)

heater means and false twist device (FD, SD, TC, TW); and yarn measurement means

(YS) making a measurement on the yarn in said path which is indicative of the effect of
the texturising on the yarn and operatively connected to said control means (CN) so as

to effect control in accordance with said measurement.
Apparatus according to claim 17, comprising a single station of a
multistation yarn texturising machine, the stations being arranged to produce yarn having

similar properties.
