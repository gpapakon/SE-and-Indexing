<ABSTRACT>
The method comprises a series of steps, with raw meat as a starting material, including a hydrolysis with a specified neutral and alkaline protease. The meat hydrolyzate exhibits excellent organoleptic properties and can be used as a flavoring additive to a soup concentrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hydrolysis of meat in order to manufacture a meat hydrolyzate useable
as a food flavoring agent, which can be added to e.g. soup concentrates is an old
art. Reference can be made to Japanese patent no. 72-13092 and to "AMPC Product
Applications Summary", published by American Meat Protein Corporation, 2325
North Loop Drive, Ames, Iowa 50010, U.S.A.One of the problems encountered in this area is the organoleptic
properties of the meat hydrolyzate, which is open to improvement. Reference can
be made to Meat Science 11 (1984) 227-238 (O'Meara & Munro: Effects of reaction
variables on the hydrolysis of lean beef tissue by Alcalase®). This reference
describes a process for production of a beef meat hydrolyzate, which, however,
exhibits an unagreeable degree of bitterness. Documentation will be presented later
in this specification. Also, treatment of meat with proteases comprising both endo-and
exo-activties belong to the prior art; these meat hydrolyzates also exhibit
unsatisfactory organoleptic properties.Thus, the purpose of the invention is the provision of a method for
production of a meat hydrolyzate, which exhibits better organoleptic properties than
the hitherto known meat hydrolyzates.Now, surprisingly it has been found that the purpose of the invention
is fulfilled, if raw meat is treated in a specified manner with a special combination of
proteases, more precisely stated if raw meat is treated with more than one protease,
and if, predominantly, preferably exclusively endo-activities are present during the
hydrolysis.Thus, the method according to the invention for production of a meat
hydrolyzate is characterized by the fact that
a) raw meat is mechanically pretreated,b) water is added in an amount which makes the mixture of the
mechanically pretreated meat and water stirrable and treatable in a
centrifuge,c) pH is adjusted to a value between 5.5 and 7.5, d) a neutral protease producible by means of a Bacillus strain and an
alkaline protease producible by means of a Bacilllus strain is added in
a proportion, which will result in a final meat hydrolyzate with a
bitterness below the threshold value for bitterness, and a hydrolysis is
carried out to a DH between 3 and 20%,e) the proteases in the hydrolyzed mixture are inactivated by heating,
whereby the temperature during the steps a) to d) inclusive does not
exceed 70°C, andf) the inactivated mixture from step e) is converted to a fat free meat
hydrolyzate.Surprisingly it has been found that the meat hydrolyzate producible by
means of the method
