Time clock according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the foil pushbutton elements
(19) are arranged on a circuitboard unit (20).
Time clock according to one of claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that
 the foil
pushbutton elements (19) are arranged as several in a switching element support (25) with

the shape of a section of a ring. 
Time clock according to claims 4 to 6, 
characterised in that
 the bridge-shaped
contact elements (26) of the foil pushbutton elements (19) are arranged to be able to be

acted on directly at the adjacent conductor tracks (27) of the circuitboard unit (20).
Time clock according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that
 the buttons (15
and 15a) are combined into a keyboard unit and that the individual buttons (15 and 15a)

are connected together by way of spring elements (23) arranged at one side at the buttons
(15 and 15a).
Time clock according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the spring elements (23) are
arranged in the region of the inner edges (63) of the individual buttons (15 and 15a).
Time clock according to one of claims 8 and 9, 
characterised in that
 the keyboard
unit together with the buttons (15, 15a) is guided to be positionally fixed in corresponding

mechanically positively coupled button openings (42) in the front side (9) of the housing
shell (1).
Time clock according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that
 a plate, which

is similar to a circuitboard, for the mechanical and electrical installation arrangement of the
load switching system (37) is provided in the housing shell (2) at the rear side.
Time clock according to one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised in that
 the circuitboard
unit (29) is detachably arranged in force-locking manner on a support plate (21) and that

the support plate (21) is positionally fixed and fastened in the housing shell (1) at the front
side.
Time clock according to one of claims 11 and 12, 
characterised in that
 the electrical
connection between the circuitboard unit (20) and the plate (34) is provided by means of

an electrical plug connection system (39).
Time clock according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
characterised in that
