<CLAIMS>
Brake-booster comprising a casing (10) within 
which is found at least one piston structure which, with 

the help of an unrolling membrane (12), defines at least 
one front chamber (16) permanently connected to a partial 

vacuum source via a valve (17) and at least one back 
chamber (18) connected selectively to the front chamber 

(16) or to the atmosphere via a valve means (34) when a 
control rod (30) is actuated, and a device (36) for 

fastening the booster on a wall (38) adjacent to a first 
face of the casing (10), apertures (50, 60) being made in 

the piston structure (14) and in a second face of the 
casing (10) and aligned in the axial direction of the 

booster so as to permit the actuation of the fastening 
device (36) through the aperture (60) made in the second 

face of the casing (10), characterized in that the 
aperture (50) made in the piston structure (14) receives 

a closing member (52, 64), integral with the piston 
structure and movable with it. 
Booster according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the fastening device (36) is constituted by a screw (36) 

received in an aperture (46) of the first face of the 
casing (10) so as to be free in rotation in this aperture 

(46) and to be imprisoned by this aperture (46). 
Booster according to Claim 2, characterized in that 
the screw (36) comprises a head having a shape complementary 

to that of a tightening tool. 
Booster according to Claim 3, characterized in that 

the closing member is a valve (52). 
Booster according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
the valve (52) is formed by a tubular part (56) of the 

unrolling membrane (12) whose edges remote from the 
piston structure (14) normally remain flattened against 

one another. 
Booster according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the closing member is an intermediate member (64) received 

in leaktight manner in an aperture (70) of the piston 
structure (14). 
Booster according to Claim 6, characterized in that  
 

the intermediate member (64) comprises a first end part 
(74) having a shape complementary to that of the head of 

a tightening tool and a second end part (76) having a 
shape complementary to that of the head (82) and of the 

screw (36). 
Booster according to Claim 6, characterized in that 
the intermediate member (64) is constituted by a blind 

tube the part (84) of which situated in the direction of 
the screw (36) has a shape complementary to the shape of 

the head (82) of the screw (36) 
Booster according to Claim 8, characterized in that 
the tube (64) comprises a fold (86) forming an outer 

flange and an inner groove. 
Booster according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that a retaining ring (90) is resiliently mounted on the 

tightening tool (88) and is received in the inner groove 
of the tube (64). 
Booster according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an auxiliary housing (25) is secured to the piston 

structure (14) and projects into the front chamber (16), 
an auxiliary piston (27) internally dividing the 

auxiliary housing (25) in leaktight manner into two 
chambers (29, 31) by virtue of an auxiliary membrane 

(33), the auxiliary piston (27) being mounted fixed with 
respect to the casing (10) by means of at least one 

cylindrical extension (35) extending backward and 
fastened to the casing (10) around the fastening means 

(36), the cylindrical extension (35) being coaxial with 
the aperture (50) made in the piston structure (14). 
Booster according to Claim 1, additionally 
comprising a fixed partition (1) delimiting, inside the 

casing (10), a front volume (A) and a back volume (B), 
the front volume being divided in leaktight manner into 

a front chamber (116) and a back chamber (118) by a 
second piston structure (114) secured to the piston 

structure (14) of the back volume (B) by means of a 
tubular part (122) which traverses, in leaktight manner, 

the fixed partition (11), characterized in that apertures 
(13, 150) are made in the fixed partition (11) and in the  

 
second piston structure (114), aligned in the axial 

direction of the booster with the apertures (50, 60) made 
in the piston structure (14) of the back volume (B) and 

in the second face of the casing (10) and receiving a 
tube (17) with leaktight sliding. 
Booster according to any of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the aperture (60) made in 

the second face of the casing (10) is closed off by a 
plug (62). 
Booster according to any of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the aperture (60) made in the 

second face of the casing (10) is closed off by the valve 
(17).
