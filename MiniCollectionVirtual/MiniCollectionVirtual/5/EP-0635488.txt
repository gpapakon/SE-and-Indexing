<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing an
azetidinone compound which is useful as a synthetic intermediate for a 1β-methylcarbapenem
derivative having an antibacterial activity, and a novel
starting compound therefor.1β-Methylcarbapenem derivatives have been of great interests for
their excellent antibacterial activities against a wide range of microorganisms
including Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, especially against
Cephem-resistant bacteria, and their excellent stabilities in the human bodies.Said 1 β-methylcarbapenem derivatives have been synthesized by
various processes up to now. In these processes, the azetidinone compound
having a β-methyl group at the 1'-position of the 4-side chain of the formula:

wherein R is a protected or unprotected hydroxy-substituted lower alkyl group,
is especially important synthetic intermediate, which is prepared by removing 1'-hydrogen
atom of the acetic acid moiety at the 4-position with a strong base,
followed by introducing a methyl group to the product [cf. Heterocycles, 21, 29
(1984)].However, it is difficult to stereoselectively obtain compounds having
1'-substituent with β-configuration of the 4-side chain by this process, and
therefore, various processes for preparing stereoselectively the compound
having 1'-substituent with β-configuration have been reported.For example, Fuentes et al. suggest a process of reacting 4-acetoxyazetidinone 
compound with a specific propionimide in the presence of a
complex reagent of a specific base and a Lewis acid (e.g. tin triflate-ethylpiperidine-zinc
bromide, diethylboran triflate-diisopropylethylamine-zinc
bromide, etc.) (cf. L.M. Fuentes et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 108, 4675 (1986)).
The similar process to Fuentes's is also reported by Nagao et al. (cf. Y. NAGAO
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 108, 4673 (1986)).Besides, there is also reported a process of reacting 4-acetoxy-azetidinone
compound with propionic acid thiol ester or propionic acid ester in
the presence of a complex reagent of a base and a Lewis acid (cf. C. U. Kim et
al., Tetrahedron Lett., 28, 507 (1978), A. Martel et al., Can. J. Chem., 66, 1537
(1988), and M. Endo, Can. J. Chem., 65, 2140 (1987)).However, a complex reagent of a base and a Lewis acid is essential
in these processes, and there are obtained as side-products undesirable
compounds having the 1'-substituent with α-configuration, and hence, the yield
and purity of the desired 1'-β-compound is insufficient.An object of the present invention is to provide a novel
