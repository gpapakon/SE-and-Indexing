<CLAIMS>
Plug-connector coupling, having a female 
connector (8,9,15) and having a male connector (1), which 

together form a connector pair and are composed of 
insulating material and each have receptacles for the 

insertion and primary securing of socket contacts, at 
least one resilient short-circuiting bridge (12) being 

provided, which connects two respective socket contacts 
of the female connector to one another, and the male 

connector, parallel to contact pins which are arranged in 
at least one row, are intended for insertion into the 

correspondingly arranged socket contacts of the female 
connector and are respectively connected to their own 

socket contacts, having an interrupter element for each 
short-circuiting bridge, which interrupter element 

cancels the short circuit between the two respective 
socket contacts when the female connector and male 

connector are coupled, characterized in that an electrical 
filter component is integrated in the male 

connector (1) and is connected in series between two 
socket contacts (10, 11) of the connector pair which are 

connected to one another during the coupling. 
Plug connector according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the component is electrically connected to 

the angled ends of two contact pin parts (21), which are 
arranged and fixed, in mirrored form rotated through 

180Â°, laterally offset with respect to one another in a 
row with the other contact pins (22, 23) in the male 

connector (1). 
Plug connector according to Claim 1 or 2,  
 

characterized in that the male connector (1) has an 
approximately cylindrical design, the end on the female 

connector side being open and the male connector (1) 
being designed there for the partial accommodation of the 

female connector during coupling, and the male connector 
(1) having, towards the end on the cable outlet side, two 

chambers which can be closed off by a first and second 
closure cover (5, 6), are designed, in particular, 

approximately as half-cylinders and are provided for the 
isolated accommodation of the component and of the socket 

contacts (11), respectively. 
Plug connector according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the first chamber, which can be closed off 

by the first closure cover (5), has a trough-like recess 
which is intended to accommodate the somewhat smaller 

component and in which the component is resiliently held 
by means of at least one spring tab which is integrally 

formed on the inside of the first closure cover (5). 
Plug connector according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the female connector comprises a 

socket housing (9) which can be pushed in a polarized 
manner into a covering cap (8) and in which the socket 

contacts (10) and the at least one short-circuiting 
bridge (12) are arranged, and comprises a closure plate 

(15) which can be pushed axially onto the covering cap 
(8). 
Plug connector according to Claim 5, characterized 
in that the socket housing (9) is provided with 

guide grooves (16) into which guide ribs (14) which are 
integrally formed on the cov
ering cap (8) engage when the 
said socket housing is pushed into the said covering cap, 

definitive securing of the socket contacts (10) being 
effected at the same time. 
Plug connector according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
characterized in that the socket contacts (11) of the 

male connector (1) are definitively secured by means of 
a transverse web (7) which is integrally formed on the 

inside of the second closure cover (6) which closes off  
 

the second chamber. 
Plug connector according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that a coil (3) is integrated as filter 

component in the male connector (1).
