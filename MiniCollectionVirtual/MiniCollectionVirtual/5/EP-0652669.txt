<ABSTRACT>
A method for gray scale printing combining pulse width modulation and 
time delay and integration. The data for each printed row is pulse width 

modulated on a predetermined modulator row (304). The printed row data 
is then shifted to the next row (306) on the modulator (302) in the 

process direction (308) after the completion of all bits of pulse width 
modulation. The same spot on the photosensitive surface is exposed 

multiple times as it passes by the modulator rows.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of gray scale printing
using spatial light modulator arrays, and a printer
or print engine for performing this method.Printing systems trying to achieve gray scale can use spatial light
modulators in several ways. The arrays usually have to be defined to a
specific dimension, making each type of printing application require a
different device. Desktop electrophotographic printing using highly sensitive
media, at 600 dots-per-inch (dpi), needs one configuration of a device or
devices, whereas a computer to plate offset system using relatively
insensitive media needs another. This translates into high cost, low volume
production runs. Yet, the needs of different systems must be met.The computer to plate systems need large arrays that can time delay
and integrate (TDI) . The image data for one line on the board passes from
line to line on the device, keeping the image data for that line on the board
the entire time the board is under the device. This gives high energy transfer
onto the photosensitive media, which does not have very high sensitivity. A
typical array for this application may have as many as 256 rows. This
appears satisfactory for printing, allowing 256 gray shades.However, desktop printing has a different problem. Because of the
curvature and movement of the drum, it is nearly impossible to optically
"wrap" a 256-row device around it. Yet, 256 rows of gray scale gives printing
system users what they need. Therefore, some way must be developed to
allow a smaller device to achieve gray scale, and still make those same
devices compatible with systems that have different needs. EP-A-0 321 143 discloses a color printing system employing a
large area pattern of controllable light sources, where the
pattern includes rows that are aligned substantially with
the movement of a print medium in relation to the light
sources. All of the light sources in each row contribute to
the exposure of each pixel in a corresponding row of the
resulting color print according to the TDI-principle.US-A-4 074 319 discloses a method for developing a pictorial
field display from transmitted facsimile data. The display,
which comprises an array of two level energy sources such as
light emitting diodes, achieves multitone operation by
digitally controlling the number of times during which the
energy sources are activated according to the TDI-principle.EP-A-0 467 048 discloses a method of

<CLAIMS>
A method of gray scale printing utilizing a light source;
a spatial light modulator comprised of an array of

individually controlled elements arranged in an x-y grid of
rows and columns so as to receive light from said source;

and a moving photosensitive surface arranged so as to
receive modulated light from said individually controlled

elements in their on state; said method further
comprising the steps of:


pulse width modulating data within each row of said
modulator, wherein said modulator elements receive and

respond to said data by assuming their on or off states, and said
data are comprised of at least two bits of differing

significance received serially by said elements, each
element responding to said bits by assuming the state

dictated by the current bit for a period of time
proportional to the significance of that bit;
row integrating said pulse width modulated data by
addressing the modulator such that successive rows of said

modulator receive the same pulse width modulated data for a same line on
said photosensitive surface, causing the data for that line

on the photosensitive surface to move across the face of the
modulator synchronized with the movement of said

photosensitive surface; and
imaging light from the on states of the elements of the
modulator to said photosensitive surface through a

lens.

modulation is performed on a digital micromirror device.
The method of claim 1, wherein said pulse width
modulation is performed on a liquid crystal device.
The method of any preceding claim, wherein said
photosensitive surface is a drum in a xerographic printer.
The method of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
photosensitive surface is an offset printing plate.
The method of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
photosensitive surface is a photographic film.
The method of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
photosensitive surface is a photographic paper.
