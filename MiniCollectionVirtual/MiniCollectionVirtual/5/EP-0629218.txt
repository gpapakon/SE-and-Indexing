<ABSTRACT>
Polyether glycols, especiallly poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (PTMEG) having a narrow molecular weight distribution of about 1.25 to 1.80, or dispersity of 1.05 to 1.90, are made by a process which consists of distilling the low molecular weight fraction in unit operations comprising at least one short-path distillation evaporator. Two short-path distillation evaporators, in series, are desirable if significant narrowing of the PTMEG is required. In these units, PTMEG is subjected to temperatures in the range of 150 DEG -400  DEG C with the hold-up time varying between 10-200 seconds. The required vacuum to force the separation of the low molecular weight PTMEG varies between 0.001 mm and 1.0 mbar. PTMEG residue from the distillation unit is also characterized by its low water content and low concentration of oligomeric cyclic ethers.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLE REDUCING MOLECULAR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION OF POLYETHER GLYCOLS BY SHORT-PATH DISTILLATION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for reducing the molecular weight distribution or the polydispersity of polyether glycols, particularly poly(tetramethylene ether) glycols, by short-path distillation to separate lower molecular weight fractions at low pressure and elevated temperatures.RELATED ART The present invention relates to a process for preparing a narrow molecular weight distribution (NMWD) poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol (PTMEG), and, more particularly, to an improved batchwise or continuous distillation removal of low molecular weight species in a short-path distillation system. Japanese Patent Application Tokukai 60-42421 (Mitsubishi) describes a process for preparing PTMEG of narrow molecular weight distribution in which a PTMEG having an average molecular weight of from 500 to 3000 is admixed with a mixed solvent comprising water and methanol. A much larger amount, i.e., greater than 1.2 times, of mixed solvent, having a water content in the range of 30-70% by weight based on total solvent, is used in proportion to PTMEG, in terms of weight ratio, to bring about separation of low molecular weight PTMEG. Separation is effected by the usual techniques for layer separation.U.S. Patent 3,478,109 describes a method for removing the lower molecular weight fraction of PTMEG from a PTMEG starting material. The PTMEG starting material is dissolved in a cycloaliphatic (cyclohexane) and/or aromatic solvent, and in an aqueous methanol solution which is used as the extracting solvent for removal of the lower molecular weight fraction of PTMEG from the starting material. When the process is operated batchwise, the amount of cyclohexane present must be in excess, by weight, of the PTMEG starting material. Japanese Patent Application No. 215111 (1983), published asJapanese Laid-Open No. 108424/1985 on June 13, 1985, describes a method for fractional precipitation of PTMEG having a sharp molecular weight distribution which comprises contacting a PTMEG starting material with water in the presence of methanol and/or ethanol. The amount of water needed is up to 1.7 times the amount of methanol, or up to 3.0 times the amount of ethanol, and the 

precipitation of the desired PTMEG fraction can be controlled by the amount of water present.U.S. Patent 4,762,951 (Mueller to BASF) describes a process for narrowing the molecular weight distribution of polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF = PTMEG) and
