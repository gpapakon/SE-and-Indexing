<ABSTRACT>
Polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin resin solutions with less than 1500 ppm of 
epichlorohydrin hydrolyzates after acid stabilization are produced by contacting the resin 

solution with either (a) dibasic phosphate salts having the general formula M₂HPO₄ where 
M represents Na, K, or NH₄, or (b) a nucleophilic alkanolamine at a temperature of less 

than about 50° C for a time sufficient to produce a product solution having, after 
stabilization with acid, less than 1500 ppm of epichlorohydrin hydrolyzates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for making polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin resin 
products having a low level of residual epichlorohydrin hydrolyzates. Polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin resin products exhibiting thermoset properties are 
useful for increasing the wet strength of papers and reducing paper "creep" while the paper 
is wet. As such, these resin products are in wide use and in contact with consumers on a 
daily basis. Polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin resins can be made by the reaction of 
epichlorohydrin with a polyamidoamine under basic conditions (i.e., a pH between about 
7 to about 11). The resulting resin is then contacted with an acid to stabilize the product. 
See, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,311,594 and 3,442,754. Any unreacted epichlorohydrin in the 
product is hydrolyzed by the acid to, inter alia, 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP), 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol 
(CPD), and 2,3-dichloro-1-propanol (2,3-DCP). The 1,3-DCP 
product is the predominant hydrolysis product with CPD being formed in levels of about 
10% of the 1,3-DCP and 2,3-DCP being formed in levels of about 1% of the 1,3-DCP. 
Although the final product will contain several other types of organic chlorines (as 
measured by the difference between inorganic chloride and total chlorine concentrations), 
the 1,3-DCP and CPD concentrations can be accurately determined by C¹³ NMR and GC-MS 
measuring techniques known in the art. The 2,3-DCP concentrations are, however, 
generally below the detection limit of C¹³ NMR so 1,3-DCP and CPD are generally used 
as measurements for the epichlorohydrin hydrolysis products present in the resin. Epichlorohydrin has recently been classified as a potential human carcinogen and 
there is some concern that the hydrolysis products therefrom may pose similar health 
concerns. There is also some indication that the organic chloride hydrolyzates contribute 
to adsorbable organic halide contamination of effluent waters. It is, therefore, desirable  
 
to develop wet strength resins having low levels of epichlorohydrin and its hydrolysis 
products. There is some indication, though that elimination of all hydrolyzates may 
adversely affect product performance because hydrolyzates contribute to the ability of the 
resin product to provide wet strength for paper products. See, column 2 of U.S. Patent 
No. 4,853,431. A number of recent publications address the problems of residual hydrolyzates for 
polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin resin products. U.S. Patent No. 4,975,499 describes an object of the invention as
