<ABSTRACT>
A tube coupling for fluidic apparatus connects 
flexible hose or other tubes to ports of different sizes 

and shapes provided in fluidic apparatus. The tube 
coupling comprises a base to be attached to a port in a 

fluidic apparatus, a tube connector to connect a tube, 
and a metal holder that keeps in position the tube connector 

attached to the base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tube couplings for connecting
flexible hoses and other tubular products to change-over
valves, manifolds and other apparatus for controlling
pressurized fluids including compressed air.Flexible hoses and other tubes to lead pressurized fluids
including compressed air are connected to ports on change-over
valves, manifolds and other fluid controlling apparatus. Such
connection is generally achieved by means of a threaded casing
attached to one end of such a tube and screwed into the mating
port or a one touch coupling that accomplishes connection by
simply inserting the tube end into the connector. However,
these conventional threaded casings and couplings may not be
suited for ports of certain sizes and shapes. This problem
can be solved if as wide an assortment of casings and
couplings as will fit ports of practically all sizes and
shapes are prepared. However, such a wide assortment of
casings and coupling are difficult to prepare because they
will make their handling more intricate and their design,
manufacture and inventory control more costly.EP-A-521 776 describes a tube coupling when the ends of
tubes are trapped by means of an S-shaped member which can be
twisted into place to trap the ends of tubes in openings in a
base.An object of this invention is to provide a tube coupling
that permits easy and sure connection of tubes to ports of
fluidic apparatus of different sizes and shapes.According to the invention there is provided a tube
coupling for a fluidic apparatus which comprises a detachable
base adapted to be attached to a port (A,B) in the fluidic
apparatus, a tube connector to connect a flexible hose or
other tube, and a detachable metal holder adapted to be
attached to the base to keep the tube connector fastened to
the base, the base having as many connections as ports (A,B)
in the fluidic apparatus to hold the tube connector and 
establish individual communication with the ports (A,B) in the
fluidic apparatus when the base is attached thereto, the metal
holder having as many U-shaped notches as connection ports
(A,B) to keep in position the tube connectors fitted therein,
and the tube connector being such that the tube is connected
by simply inserting the end of the tube into the connector,
characterised at least one projection adapted to come in
contact with the side of the tube connector is provided around
the connection in the top surface of the base at a point
corresponding to the notch in the metal holder, and each notch
has an edge that comes in

<CLAIMS>
A tube coupling (2) for a fluidic apparatus (1) which
comprises a detachable base (41) adapted to be attached to a

port (A,B) in the fluidic apparatus (1), a tube connector (43)
to connect a flexible hose or other tube (40), and a

detachable metal holder (42) adapted to be attached to the
base (41) to keep the tube connector (43) fastened to the

base, the base (41) having as many connections as ports (A,B)
in the fluidic apparatus (1) to hold the tube connector (43)

and establish individual communication with the ports (A,B) in
the fluidic apparatus (1) when the base (41) is attached

thereto, the metal holder (42) having as many U-shaped notches
(51) as connection ports (A,B) to keep in position the tube

connectors (43) fitted therein, and the tube connector (43)
being such that the tube (40) is connected by simply inserting

the end of the tube into the connector (43), characterised in
that at least one projection (54) adapted to come in contact

with the side of the tube connector (43) is provided around
the connection in the top surface of the base (41) at a point

corresponding to the notch (51) in the metal holder (42), and
each notch (51) has an edge (51a) that comes in engagement

with a groove (61) around the tube connector (43) fitted
therein, thereby securely keeping the tube connector (43) in

position.
A tube coupling as claimed in Claim 1 in which the metal
holder is S-shaped when viewed from above, with two notches

one cut from each side thereof.
