<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a remedy for inflammatory intestinal 
diseases which contains as the active ingredient 9-(4-acetyl-3-hydroxy-2-n-propylphenoxymethyl)-3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidine-4-one 
(hereinafter referred to as Compound 1) or a physiologically acceptable salt 
thereof. Inflammatory intestinal diseases are spontaneous and chronic diseases of 
which typical examples are ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and the 
numbers of the patients are steadily increasing in recent years. Many principal 
and clinical investigation have been vigorously carried out by the 
investigating groups such as the special diseases investigating group on 
refractory inflammatory intestinal disorders of Ministry of Health, Japan, 
however, the cause and the morbidity of the diseases have not been discovered. For the treatment for inflammatory intestinal diseases, only several 
attempts such as, the administration of an immunosuppressive agent, 6-mercaptopurine, 
the voluminous administration of an antibacterial agent, 
sulfasalazine, and oral, intravenous, topical and intracolonic administration 
of steroid hormones, have been made. However, these pharmaceutical treatments 
can play only as symptomatic therapy for the diseases and are not the one which 
can quickly remove the symptoms arising from digestive organs, such as diarrhea, 
bloody stool, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, these drugs mentioned above 
give the side effects in a high rate and is required to be administrated 
voluminously for long period, and therefore, such drugs have a disadvantage in  
 
terms of the maintenance of the quality of life of the patients. Moreover, it 
is known that non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents such as indomethacin, which 
is commonly used for the treatment for inflammatory diseases, normally make the 
condition of the patients suffering from the inflammatory intestinal diseases 
worse, providing difficulty in the maintenance of remission of the diseases. It is an object of the present invention to remedy inflammatory reactions, 
which is the cause of the disease, in a short time and to provide highly safe 
remedy for the inflammatory intestinal diseases by removing the symptoms 
deriving from digestive organs, such as diarrhea, bloody stool, and abdominal 
pain therewith. In the course of pharmacological study on pyridopyrimidine compounds known 
as having suppressive action on central nervous system (Japanese Patent Laid-opened 
No. Sho 49-14495 Gazette), suppressive action on allergic
