<ABSTRACT>
In the present invention, a dynamically active random access memory (350) is utilized for 
the storage of subsystem label words. In turn a sequencer (320) reads stored data in 

receivers (210a - 210c) coupled to a data bus (214a - 214c). Depending upon the match of 
the label word contained in the data message stored in the receiver and those stored in the 

random access memory, the data message is stored in a like-kind information memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field of the Invention: The present invention relates to a multi-channel data
receiver for an aircraft data bus system. More particularly, the present invention was
directed to a multi-channel data system in which the data words are received, examined and
directed to designated storage devices.The operation of aircraft relies heavily on many electrical subsystems for successful
flight missions. These electrical subsystems include, among others, flight management,
navigation, auto-pilot, global positioning of systems, landing systems, fuel quantity systems,
and the like. Many of these electrical subsystems require communications therebetween,
alternatively, sensing subsystems may be located remote from the processing subsystems.
Since many of these subsystems may be provided by different manufacturers, standards have
been defined for the transfer of data messages on data buses that are wired throughout the
aircraft. One such standard is the ARINC (Aeronautical Radio Incorporated) 429 Standard.The ARINC 429 Standard is such that each data messages or data word is defined in
a number of bits where certain bits define the information which is being communicated, and
other bits define a label which indicates how the information bits are to be interpreted. In
the ARINC 429, the data message is 32 bit word in which the first 8 bits define the label,
and the later 24 bits define the information.Multi-channel receiver systems operative with the ARINC 429 Standard, commonly
employed a plurality of data receivers for capturing data from a dedicated ARINC 429 data
bus. In turn, only selected ones of these data messages having a preselected label were
processed to appropriately store the data information into a primary memory. In turn, the 
information stored in the primary memory was examined for further partitioning into
secondary dedicated memory devices, where each of the second memory devices retained
like kind information, for example, only GPS data, or only inertial reference data.Multi-channel receivers as just described generally store more information in the
memory than necessary. This is so, since only certain types of information are required
during certain flight operations, for example, in flight, on ground, and take-off. This
presents an undue burden on the main memory, and may result in loss of data and poor
performance.A system according to the introductory part of claim 1 is shown in EP-A-512 881.An object of the present invention is to provide a multi-channel data receiver
system for efficiently

<CLAIMS>
A multichannel data receiver system for distributing data messages received on a data
bus to a plurality of like-kind information memory devices, where said like-kind

information are messages having a label word which belongs to a predefined set of
label words, and where said data messages have a fixed word bit length in which a

plurality of bits define a label word indicating the subsystem origin of said data
message, and the remainder bits define an information data word,

comprising:

receivers (210a - 210c) coupled to a serial data bus for receiving said data messages
and providing a data ready signal indicative that said data message is stored in a data

register therein;
a random access memory means (350) for storing label words;
a data signal processor (390) coupled to said random access memory for selectively
erasing label words stored in said random access memory and storing selected label

words in said random access memory;
characterized by:
at least first and second secondary memory devices (360, 370) for storing data
messages of like-kind information, whereby at least two different sets of label words

are stored in at least two different memory sectors; and
a sequencer means (320) which compares the label word stored in said receiver data
register to label words stored in all sections of said random access memory means, and

if the label words from said receiver and a section of said random access memory
means match, the sequencer means (320) stores the data messages to the secondary

memory device corresponding to that section of the random access memory means.
