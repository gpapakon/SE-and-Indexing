<ABSTRACT>
A power supply system employs a control circuit (21) to regulate the 
voltage across a load capacitor (15) by monitoring the capacitor voltage by means of a 

differential voltage sensor (17) and by monitoring the drain-source voltage of a 
switching power FET (16) connected in series with the load capacitor (15) across input 

terminals (12, 13) that supply a full wave rectified voltage derived from a commercial 
AC supply voltage (10). The control circuit (21) controls the switching action of the 

power FET (16) in a manner such that the load capacitor (15) is charged at least once 
during each cycle of the rectified voltage (unfiltered). This method of voltage regulation 

by monitoring the load capacitor voltage and the FET voltage (V
ds
) provides significant 
advantages over other forms of voltage regulation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power supply circuits, and particularly, to a low power
transformerless, inductorless power supply circuit of the switching type, and more
particularly to a switching type regulated power supply for energizing a load
comprising:
first and second input terminals for supplying a pulsatory type rectified voltage
to the power supply,a load capacitor and a switching transistor in a series circuit connected across
the first and second input terminals,a pair of output terminals coupled to the load capacitor, anda control circuit having input means coupled to the switching transistor and an
output coupled to a control electrode of the switching transistor.Such a switching type regulated power supply is known from European Patent
Application EP-A-0 256 569. One common form of power supply, which can be found in certain TV
receivers, consists of a full wave bridge rectifier,a load capacitor (e.g. 330ÂµF), and a
linear regulator. The bridge rectifier generates a voltage which is filtered by the load
capacitor. The load capacitor voltage is then fed to the linear regulator which in turn
regulates the voltage at a preselected level, for example, 130V.This power supply has certain disadvantages and limitations. For a 120V
AC input, 170V is generated across the load capacitor of the bridge rectifier. Since the
linear regulator must produce an output voltage of 130V, there is a 40V drop across the
regulator itself, drawing up to 1 amp of current. In order to protect the regulator from
damage due to the excessive amount of dissipated power, a number of thermal resistors
are connected in parallel with the regulator so as to shunt a part of the current. These
resistors are bulky and thus are undesirable as they increase the cost of the overall
system and furthermore occupy a significant amount of space on the TV board. In
addition, they allow only a small variation in the line voltage because if the voltage
rating of the load capacitor is exceeded, damage to the load capacitor as well as the
linear regulator may occur. This power supply therefore requires a well regulated 120V
commercial line voltage. Since the load capacitor is charged only once for each half
cycle of the AC supply voltage, higher peak capacitor charge currents result, along with
other attendant difficulties.U.S. Patent 4,685,046 (8/4/87) describes a transformerless, low voltage,
direct current power supply of the switching type adapted to energize a low voltage
direct current load. A full-wave bridge rectifier is coupled
