<ABSTRACT>
A non-volatile memory device is provided having an array 
with self-aligned interpoly dielectrics placed between a stacked 

pair of polysilicon strips. The self-aligned interpoly 
dielectrics are aligned with the edges of the stacked polysilicon 

strips to provide good coupling between the polysilicon strips as 
well as to insure additional oxide does not grow during times in 

which bit line oxides are formed over virtual ground bit line 
diffusions. The self-aligned interpoly dielectrics need not be 

removed during the fabrication process and, accordingly, 
additional thermal cycles necessary to remove and then re-form an 

additional (or replacement) dielectric need not occur. 
Additionally, wet oxide is placed at the polysilicon/silicon-oxide 

interface followed by dry oxide in order to enhance data 
retention of the floating polysilicon while further minimizing 

thermal cycles and short-channel effects associated therewith.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to integrated circuits and more
particularly to a virtual ground non-volatile memory array with
self-aligned interpoly dielectrics and method for manufacturing
same.There are many types of non-volatile memory, often called
read only memory (ROM) or programmable read only memory (PROM).
Non-volatile memory can be formed in either bipolar or MOS
technology. Most MOS PROMs can be formed using one of three
currently available technologies (EPROM, EEPROM or FLASH EPROM).Non-volatile MOS PROMs are designed and perform in numerous
similar ways, and can be achieved using many well-known
technologies such as: (i) floating gate tunnel oxide, (ii)
textured poly, (iii) metal nitride oxide silicon (MNOS), and (iv)
EPROM - tunnel oxide (ETOX). Program and erase of the
corresponding EPROM cell differs depending upon which technology
is used. For example, a floating gate tunnel oxide EPROM
transistor is programmed (moving electrons into the floating
gate) by biasing the control gate, while erasure (moving
electrons out of the floating gate) is achieved by biasing the
drain. Programming a textured poly-type EPROM device is achieved
by electrons tunneling from a first polysilicon to a second
polysilicon, wherein erase is achieved by electrons tunneling
from the second polysilicon to a third polysilicon. MNOS-type
devices allow charge to be stored in discrete traps in the bulk
of the nitride. In each form of EPROM, it is generally
recognized that stacked polysilicon conductors be used to perform 
the program and erase function. A comparison on floating gate
tunnel oxide, textured poly, MNOS technologies and the program
and erase thereof is described by S. Lai et al., "Comparison and
Trends in Today's Dominate E2 Technologies", Int'l Electron
Devices Meeting Tech. Digest, (1986) pp. 580-583 (herein
incorporated by reference).In order to form the stacked polysilicon conductors (one
being a floating gate conductor and the other being a control
gate conductor) numerous processing steps are required.
Placement of the tunneling oxide, the floating gate and the
dielectric between the floating gate and the control gate must be
carefully performed such that each structure is aligned during
the lithography steps. It is also essential that the floating
gate, control gate, tunnel oxide and interpoly dielectric be of
small critical dimensions and placed close to one another in
order to provide a dense array of programmable transistors
coupled to corresponding word and bit lines extending throughout
the array. In
