<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the use of body 
fluid-soluble nuclear matrix proteins as cellular 
markers. More particularly, the invention relates to a 
method of monitoring the degree of cell death in a 
tissue by monitoring the level of interior nuclear 
matrix proteins and/or fragments thereof released from 
cells in a body fluid-soluble form. Cell death occurs as a function of healthy tissue 
homeostasis, as well as a result of disease or injury 
to the tissue. Detectable changes in the rate of cell 
death in a tissue therefore can provide an indication 
of the tissue's status. In normal growing tissue, for 
example, changes in the rate of cell death can indicate 
a new developmental stage. Alternatively, a sudden 
detected change in cell death in adult tissue can 
signal an injury to the tissue and also provide 
information on the type of injury. Previously, 
clinical assessment of tissue viability has required 
presentation of clinical symptoms and a visual 
inspection of the tissue itself, requiring observation 
of the morphology of cells in a tissue sample, and/or 
an indirect estimation of cell death by measuring 
changes in tissue/organ size. While the state of the 
art of morphological observation has advanced 
significantly, reliance on histological observation of 
an abnormality requires that the abnormal cells 
comprise part of the tissue sample tested. Early 
stages of a malignancy therefore can be particularly 
difficult to detect by this method. Biochemical  
 
assessments of cell or tissue viability also generally 
have been difficult to interpret, primarily because an 
many instances cell death occurs in individual cells 
which are intimately intermixed with viable cells in a 
sample. There exists a need for reliable means of 
monitoring the degree of cell death in a tissue which 
does not rely on histology or tissue biopsy. A 
particularly useful method would be one wherein the 
rate of cell death could be monitored in a body fluid 
assay. It is anticipated that the ability to 
accurately monitor tissue-specific cell death in a 
fluid assay would have significant impact on the study 
of tissue development and cell kinetics, as well as on 
many different clinical applications. For example, the 
method may be used to monitor the progress of a disease 
or injury associated with cell death, as well as to 
monitor the efficacy of a therapy for an affected 
tissue. The method also may be used to monitor the 
effect of the therapy on unaffected, normal tissue. In 
addition, the
