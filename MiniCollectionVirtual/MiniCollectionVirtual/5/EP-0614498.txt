<CLAIMS>
Device for electrolytic deposition of metal on the 
metal strips forming the cathode, which are passed in 

an electrolyte through a gap between two parallel flat 
or rod-like anodes, there being located in said gap two 

edge masks which are adjustable transversely to the 
strip direction, each having two shanks for covering in 

a screened manner the edge region of the metal strip, 
characterised in that the shanks (41) of each edge mask 

(4) bear in a resiliently prestressed manner against 
the anodes (2) . 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the edge masks (4) are V-shaped in cross-section. 
Device according to claim 2, characterised in that a 
web (42) connecting the shanks (41) forms the apex of 

the V.
