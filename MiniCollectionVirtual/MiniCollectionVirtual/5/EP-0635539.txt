 , in which     Q is a -CONH2 group,   m is 1 or 2, R1 and R2, independently of one another, are hydrogen, Cl, Br, CH3 or C2H5,   R3 is hydrogen, CH3, C2H5 or phenyl, X is a direct bond, -O-, -S-, -SO2-, -CH=CH-, -CH2- or -C(CH3)2-, and     Y is -O- or -S-.   The pigments to be used according to the invention exhibit extraordinary heat stability and excellent light stability during mass colouring of polyamides.
