<ABSTRACT>
An optical working shaft is disclosed through the distal end of which a high power optical radiation may be emitted, in particular for insertion into the working channel of an endoscope or similar catheter. The path of the radiation to the distal end extends at least in the distal area within a fluid which is at the same time a coolant for evacuating the waste heat generated by the radiation and a radiation-dispersing medium. The fluid forms also the coolant for evacuating the waste heat generated by dispersing the radiation.

An optical working shaft wherein optical beams of increased output can be
radiated through the distal end, in particular for insertion into the working tube of an

endoscope or other catheter, wherein an optical waveguide (2) conveys the beam
essentially to the distal end, and wherein at least in the distal area the path of the beam

to the distal end extends in a fluid (21), which is a radiation dispersing medium and
which scatters the optical beam through an optical dome (5) at its distal end as the

beam traverses the fluid (21), wherein the optical dome (5) is transparent to the optical
beam

A working shaft in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that an easily vaporising fluid is provided as the fluid (21).
A working shaft in accordance with claim 10, characterised in that the vaporisable
fluid is alcohol and/or fluorocarbon.
A working shaft in accordance with one of claims 10 or 11, characterised in that
the vaporisable fluid can be recondensed by means of a condenser-pump or

compressor-condenser arrangement and can be again supplied to the process as a
fluid.

separate hose or a tube is provided for supplying the vaporisable fluid to the distal

vaporisation region.
