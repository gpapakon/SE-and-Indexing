<ABSTRACT>
An extrusion die fabricated from sinterable ceramic or 
metal powders, for use in forming honeycomb monolith 

structures, and the method for making the die are disclosed. 
The method for producing the die comprises the steps of
 

making a thermoplastic paste from the powders
 

shaping the paste to a sinterable green preform
 

machining the preform in the green state or after partial densification 
for forming the feed holes and the discharge slots

 
and sintering the machined preform to form the die. 
Alternatively, all 
or part of the machining can be performed after full 

densification or sintering.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of fabricating objects 
having narrow intersecting slots, such as dies, from powders 
by forming slots and holes in a pre-form before it is 
sintered. Typically, dies for cellular extrusions are formed from 
solid steel blocks by drilling feed holes in the entrance 
portion of the die and cutting slots in the exit portion of 
the die such that the holes generally intersect the slots. 
Dies can also be made by stacking plates which have the 
appropriate feed holes and slots so that they generally 
intersect when stacked. Monolithic dies for extruding cellular structures are 
usually made using straight round feed holes which communicate 
from the inlet side of the die to the slots in the outlet face 
of the die. This is because straight round feed holes are 
often easier and least expensive to make. However, straight 
round holes can lead to problems since shoulders are formed 
where the holes intersect with the slots. In addition to the 
problem of high wear, this creates high back pressure during 
extrusion. There are other problems associated with the 
traditional method of forming dies. For example, for very 
thin-walled cellular extrusions which require thin slots, dies 
made by the above methods have proved both difficult and 
expensive due to the extra processing steps often required to 
produce useful dies. For example, it has been suggested to  
 
coat the slots in certain dies for example, with iron boride, 
chromium carbide, aluminum oxide, titanium carbide and the 
like, in order to produce narrow slots. To avoid the sometimes abrupt changes in cross-sectional 
area of the feed holes at their junctions with the discharge 
slots, it has been suggested in co-assigned U.S. Patent No. 
5,066,215 issued to Peters et al., to form feed holes having 
a gradual or continuous transition of flow cross-sectional 
area and shape commencing at the entrance portion or end of 
the feed hole and terminating at the exit portion or end of 
the feed holes, where longitudinal and lateral flow through 
discharge slots commences. In the reference die, the cross-sectional 
area at any location along the length of any feed 
hole is less than at any location upstream thereof. While the 
suggested die eliminates the high bending forces on the die 
and also substantially reduces abrasive wear, it is relatively 
expensive to manufacture since each hole and slot combination 
must be cut individually. It is therefore, the object of the present invention to 
provide a relatively inexpensive
