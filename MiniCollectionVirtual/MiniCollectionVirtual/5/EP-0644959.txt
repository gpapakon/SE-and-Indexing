Filament yarns having a relative viscosity RV of 
from 2.0 to 3.0 (measured at a concentration of 1 g of 

yarn per 100 ml in 96% strength by weight sulfuric acid) 
based on polycaprolactam, obtainable by 


(a) extruding a melt consisting essentially of polycaprolactam 
through a spinneret to form polycaprolactam 

filaments, 
(b) cooling the filaments thus produced, and 
(c) taking off the cooled filaments characterized in 
that the cooled filaments are taken off at a speed 

of at least [3600 + 1250 × (3.0 - RV)] m/min, 
 
with the proviso that the polycaprolactam used was 

prepared in the presence of at least one dicarboxylic 
acid selected from the group consisting of 


C₄-C₁₀-alkanedicarboxylic acids, 
C₅-C₈-cycloalkanedicarboxylic acids, 
benzene- and naphthalene-dicarboxylic acids which 
may carry up to two sulfonic acid groups and whose 

carboxylic acid groups are not adjacent to each 
other, 
N-C₁-C₆-alkyl-N,N-di(C₄-C₁₀-alkanecarboxylic acid)amine, 
1,4-piperazinedi(C₁-C₁₀-alkanecarboxylic acid). 
Filament yarns as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the polycaprolactam was prepared in the 

presence of at least one N,N-di(C₁-C₆-alkyl)amino(C₂-C₁₂-alkyl)amine. 
Filament yarns as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that they have a breaking extension of 

at most 100%.  
 
A process for producing filament yarns having a 
relative viscosity RV of from 2.0 to 3.0 (measured at a 

concentration of 1 g of yarn per 100 ml in 96% strength 
by weight sulfuric acid) based on polycaprolactam as 

claimed in claim 1, by 

(a) extruding a melt consisting essentially of polycaprolactam 
through a spinneret to form polycaprolactam 

filaments, 
(b) cooling the filaments thus produced, and 
(c) taking off the cooled filaments characterized in 
that the cooled filaments are taken off at a speed 

of at least [3600 + 1250 × (3.0 - RV)] m/min, 
 
with the proviso that the polycaprolactam used was 

prepared in the presence of at least one dicarboxylic 
acid selected from the group consisting of 


C₄-C₁₀-alkanedicarboxylic acids, 
C₅-C₈-cycloalkanedicarboxylic acids, 
benzene- and naphthalene-dicarboxylic acids which 
may carry up to two sulfonic acid groups and whose 

carboxylic acid groups are not adjacent to each 
other, 
N-C₁-C₆-alkyl-N,N-di(C₄-C₁₀-alkanecarboxylic acid)amine, 
1,4-piperazinedi(C₁-C₁₀-alkanecarboxylic acid). 
A process for producing filament yarns based on 
polycaprolactam as claimed in claim 4, characterized in 

that the polycaprolactam was prepared in the presence of 
at least one N,N-di(C₁-C₆-alkyl)amino(C₂-C₁₂-alkyl)amine 

or in the presence of at least one primary C₄-C₁₂-alkylamine 
or in the presence of at least one C₆-aryl-C₁-C₄-alkylamine. 
The use of the filament yarns as claimed in claim 
1, 2 or 3 or produced as claimed in claim 4 or 5 for 

producing fibers and sheetlike structures. 
The fibers and sheetlike structures obtainable by 
the use of claim 6.
