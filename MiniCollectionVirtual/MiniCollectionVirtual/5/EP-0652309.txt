<ABSTRACT>
An impact element (12, 17) connected to a spring device (15) is pretensioned as a result of the advancing movement of the bobbin carrier rods (5) and, when a release position (23) is reached, relaxes in such a way that it emits a force pulse (I) in the direction of the nearest spindle (6) or a remaining bobbin (22) or empty tube (3) slipped on it. The impact element first transmits the force pulse to a loosely slipped-on impact disc (19) which can be used for different tube formats and which protects the remaining bobbins.

Device for ejection of remnant packages or empty bobbins 
from a creel (1), said device comprising a package 

carrier device (5) on which numerous spindles (6) are 
arranged, one above the other, for the accomodation of 

packages, the package carrier device being able to travel 
from an operating position (8) for unwinding of the 

packages into a changing position (9) for reloading of 
the spindles, characterized in that for each row of 

spindles a striker element (12), connected with a spring 
device, is arranged in the area of movement of the 

package carrier device (5), said striker element being 
coordinated with the package carrier device (5) in such 

way that it can be placed under tension by means of the 
movement of said package carrier device, and that after 

running through a trigger position (23) the spring device 
(15) can be released in such a way that the striker 

element imparts a force impulse (I) in the direction of 
the nearest adjacent spindle (6), respectively remnant 

package (2) or empty bobbin placed upon it. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
striker element is a striker arm (12) fixed with radial 

spring action on a holder (13). 
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 

holder (13), in order to adjust the tension of the 
spring, is able to be fixed in varying angular positions 

on a holding rod (14). 
Device according to claims 2 or 3, characterized in that 
for tensioning, the striker arm (12) is equipped with a 

cam (16) up against which the package carrier device (5) 
runs and that, in order to release the force impulse in  

 
the trigger position (23), the shape of the cam recedes 

abruptly at its highest point in relation to its plane of 
movement. 
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
striker arm takes the form of a leaf spring (12), on the 

package side of which the cam (16) is mounted. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that an impact disc (19) is loosely 

arranged on each spindle (6) and that the impact disc can 
be impinged upon by the striker element, the force 

impulse (I) being imparted indirectly onto the remnant 
package or empty bobbin. 
Device according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
impact disc (19) thickens from its centre outwards. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the impact element (12) is arranged 

in such a way that, on reaching the trigger position, the 
force impulse is in each case delivered below a spindle. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that a retrieving device (21) is 

arranged below the lowest spindle in the plane of the 
trigger position (23), said retrieving device feeding the 

ejected remnant packages and empty bobbins to a conveyor 
device (22). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the package carrier device 

possesses vertical package carrier tubes (5) which are 
attached to upper and lower horizontal, continuous 

transport chains (7) and that the impact elements are 
arranged adjacent to the chain deflection wheels (10)  

 
which lie in the direction of transport between the spans 

of the chain, said spans corresponding to the operating 
position (8) and the change position (9). 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the package carrier device 

possesses horizontal package support tubes which are 
attached to lateral, vertical, continuous transport 

chains. 
Device according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the package carrier device is a 

travelling creel truck and that the striker element is 
arranged at an ejection station which is fixed in 

relation to the creel truck and which said creel truck 
must pass in order to reach the change position.
