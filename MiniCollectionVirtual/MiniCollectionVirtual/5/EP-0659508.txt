<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of this invention is to present fabrication methods and 
equipment for granulated powders whereby, the reaction between the 

R-Fe-B-type or R-Co-type rare earth containing alloy powders and the binder is 
controlled, the residual oxygen and carbon content of the sintered products 

after sintering is reduced, and whereby it is possible to obtain isotropic or 
anisotropic granulated powders having good powder flowability and lubrication 

properties when molding. After stirring a slurry of rare earth containing alloy 
powders formed by adding a binder consisting of water and at least one or 

either methyl cellulose, polyacryl amide or polyvinyl alcohol, and mixing, 
oriented liquid droplets are formed by applying a magnetic field to the slurry to 

orientate the said powder particles and spraying within the chamber of a spray 
dryer apparatus. By instantaneously dry solidifying these anisotropic 

granulated powders, it is possible to fabricate spherical granulated powders 
with good magnetic properties and a high flowability whereby the flowability 

and lubrication properties of the powder at the time of compression molding are 
improved, as well as improving the molding cycle and the dimensional precision 

of the molded product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention, relating to fabrication methods
for granulated powders formed from rare earth
containing alloys such as R-Fe-B-type and R-Co-type alloys,
regards the production of isotropic granulated powders by stirring
a slurry of the said rare earth containing alloy powders, spraying
within the chamber of a spray dryer apparatus to form liquid
droplets and instantaneously dry solidifying them, and the
production of anisotropic granulated powders by applying a
magnetic field to the slurry to orientate the said powder particles,
spraying in the said chamber to form orientated liquid droplets
and instantaneously dry solidifying them. The invention
describes these fabrication methods
for the production of isotropic and anisotropic
granulated powders with good magnetic properties where the flow
and lubrication properties of the powders at the time of
compression molding are improved, and the molding cycle and
dimensional precision are also improved.These days, with the production of small, light-weight
motors and actuators used in everything from home electrical 
goods to computer peripherals and motor vehicles, much effort is
being made to increase their efficiency. This means small, light-weight
and thin magnetic materials to be used in these motors are
also being sought.Currently, typical sintered permanent magnetic
materials are ferrite magnets, R-Co-type magnets and R-Fe-B-type
magnets previously suggested by the applicants (Japanese
Patent Publication SHO 61-34242).Of the above, rare earth magnets in particular, such as
R-Co- type and R-Fe-B-type magnets, have exceptional magnetic
characteristics compared to other magnetic materials.The above rare earth magnets, for example, the R-Fe-B
type sintered permanent magnets have extremely good magnetic
properties and have a large energy product ((BH)max) that
exceeds 40MGOe, with being over 50MGOe as the greatest energy
product. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to grind alloys of
the required composition to powders with an average particle size
of 1∼10 µm.However, as the particle size of the alloy powders is made
smaller, the flowability of the powders when molding becomes
worse, and together with a reduction in the dispersion of the
molded product density and the molding apparatus life span,
there exists a dispersion in the dimensional precision after
sintering which causes difficulties particularly in the fabrication
of thin films and small shapes. Further, rare earth magnets contain rare earth elements
and iron which are easily oxidized in the
