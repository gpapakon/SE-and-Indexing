<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to linear, fibre-forming polyesters which have been modified so as to be low-pilling and low-flammability, which comprise dicarboxylic acid and diol components and which contain, in their polymer chain, modifying units formed by transesterification or esterification reactions from compounds of the formula I and/or II and/or III,

 is hydrogen or a monovalent aliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and the index z is 0 or an integer from 1 to 2*i, where the index i is a sufficiently small integer.   The invention furthermore relates to processes for the preparation of these polyesters and to their use.
