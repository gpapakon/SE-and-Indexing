<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a lubricating 
composition for finishing synthetic textile fibers, and in 
particular to a composition containing a silahydrocarbon oil 
and an improved emulsifier having a polyoxyalkylene chain and 
a hydrophobic component having a plurality of C4-C32 aliphatic 
groups. Synthetic polymers are made into fibers in the form of 
continuous filaments, usually by a process of melt spinning. 
The filaments are cooled and converted into filament yarn, 
staple or tow. Typically, a lubricant composition or finish 
is applied to the fibers to aid in processing operations by 
reducing friction, dissipating static charges and modifying 
the pliability and yarn bundle forming characteristics of the 
fibers. The finish should be relatively non-absorbent, since 
this can adversely affect the strength and elasticity of the 
fibers. Also, as the finish is absorbed, the fibers tends to 
swell, lubrication is lost and friction increases. Another 
requirement of the finish is that it should be removable from 
the fiber by conventional procedures. Mineral oil was one of the first compositions used as a 
fiber finish for synthetic fibers. However, due to the high 
degree of absorption of mineral oil into some fibers,  
 
especially elastomeric polyurethanes, mineral oils have been 
replaced by polysiloxane oils. The polysiloxane oils provide better lubrication and are 
generally absorbed less by the fibers. In particular, 
polysiloxane oils have been useful in conjunction with 
polymers that are especially sensitive to the deleterious 
effects of absorption of lubricants, such as elastomeric 
polyurethane (spandex) fibers. Although polysiloxane oils 
have been used on elastomeric polyurethanes for well over 
twenty years, there are several drawbacks associated with the 
processing of fibers treated with these oils. The 
polysiloxane oils do not offer the cohesion needed to keep 
yarn bundles or packages together, and package degradation is 
noticed with time. The lack of boundary friction associated 
with the polysiloxane oils also leads to irregularities in 
yarn package formation, such as saddling and bulging, and 
limits yarn package size. Safety and environmental concerns also militate against 
the use of polysiloxane oils as fiber finishes. Beam 
drippings of the polysiloxane on the floors of processing 
plants creates an environment ripe for slipping accidents. 
This danger is exacerbated by the difficulty of removing 
polysiloxane oils from the floor. Environmentally, the 
polysiloxa
