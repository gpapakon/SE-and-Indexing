<ABSTRACT>
A plurality of noncontiguous polygonal regions of phase-shifting 
material have edges spaced apart less than the distance at which images 

of said edges would separate. The edges of the regions of phase-shifting 
material have differing arbitrarily selectable angular orientations 

(nonparallel as well as parallel) on a nonphase-shifting material. The 
noncontiguous phase-shifting regions may be arranged in a matrix of 

parallel columns and rows to facilitate fabrication and facilitate 
writing of the phase-shifting regions in any arbitrary pattern on an 

image plane. At least one of the phase-shifting regions constitutes a 
connective phase-shifting region with edges spaced from edges of adjacent 

ones of the phase-shifting regions to create a pattern with a continuous 
body of photoresist covering areas corresponding to the phase-shifting 

regions upon exposure of the mask. The phase-shifting regions may have 
different transmission coefficients to provide differing degrees of 

transparency or different degrees of phase shift to provide differing 
degrees of image intensity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to phase-shifting lithographic masks with
transparent portions providing regions of nonphase-shifting material
covered in part by regions of phase-shifting material.Phase-shifting masks have recently been found to facilitate
fabrication of new generations of integrated circuits and dynamic random
access memories (DRAMs). In phase-shifting masks for exposing a
photoresist pattern, phase-shift material delays the electromagnetic wave
passing through the pattern so it arrives substantially 180° out of phase
with the wave passing through the transparent apertured areas of a
nonphase-shifting material. (As herein used, the term "nonphase-shifting
material" connotes a material that introduces a constant phase shift, and
the term "phase-shifting material" connotes one that introduces an
additional phase shift due to a difference in thickness or refractive
index gradient or a combination of both.) This creates destructive
interference between the images of the nonphase-shifting regions and the
phase-shifting regions which enhances the contrast of the overall image.
It is known that the dark fringe from two closely-spaced parallel dark
phase-shifted edges can be darker than the image of a single narrow
opaque line and thus provides what has been termed a "darker-than-dark"
mask.The exact conditions under which the two edges merge depend upon
the resist processes used for lithography, but generally occur for mask
features with k1 between 0.35 (when the fringe is barely dark enough to
print) and 0.6 (when the two edges separate into two distinct dark
lines). The width w of a feature as optically imaged is given by
w = k1λNA
where NA represents the numerical aperture (typically 0.45 for modern i-line
steppers) and λ is the wavelength (λ = 0.365µm for i-line
steppers). Phase-shifting masks may or may not include a chrome layer.EP 0 464 492 A1 discloses a photomask used by photolithography and
a process for producing the same which allows a single exposure to make a
mask, thereby simplifying the mask making process, and facilitating the
inspection and correction of photomasks. In addition the phase shifter
using a slanting pattern prevents a pattern from being formed outside a
predetermined area. The use of a phase shifter which does not resolve
under an optical projection system shield a large size area against an
irradiated light, thereby allowing the formation of fine, intricate
patterns suitable for use in LSIs.Toh et al., "Chromeless Phase-shifted Masks: A New Approach td

A method for creating a mask for exposing photoresist, comprising

ammonium bifluoride, and including the step of selecting the ratio of
hydrofluoric acid to the buffer and selecting exposure time and

temperature to provide a desired phase shift and wall angle.
