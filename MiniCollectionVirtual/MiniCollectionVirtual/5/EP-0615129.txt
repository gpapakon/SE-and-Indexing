<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to methods of detecting and
measuring the presence or absence of perinuclear anti-neutrophil
cytoplasmic autoantibodies of ulcerative colitis
or primary sclerosing cholangitis. More specifically, the
methods of the present invention employ DNase treatment of
neutrophils in assays such as ELISA and immunofluorescence to
elicit the loss of a positive control value when the
autoantibody is present.Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is the collective
term used to describe two gastrointestinal disorders,
ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). IBD occurs
world-wide and is reported to afflict as many as two million
people. Onset has been documented at all ages; however, IBD
predominately affects young adults.The three most common presenting symptoms of IBD
are diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The diarrhea may
range from mild to severe and is often accompanied by urgency
and frequency. In UC, the diarrhea is usually bloody and may
contain mucus and purulent matter as well. Anemia and weight
loss are additional common signs of IBD.A battery of laboratory, radiological, and
endoscopic evaluations are combined to derive a diagnosis and
to assess the extent and severity of the disease. 
Nevertheless, differentiating UC from CD, as well as other
types of inflammatory conditions of the intestines, such as
irritable bowel syndrome, infectious diarrhea, rectal
bleeding, radiation colitis, and the like, is difficult.
Indeed, depending on the period of follow-up time, in many
patients the colitis must be regarded as indeterminate or
cannot be definitively diagnosed because of the overlapping
features of UC and CD, particularly with CD of the colon.The selective identification of UC as opposed to CD
or other inflammatory conditions of the intestines carries
important prognostic and therapeutic implications. For
example, when colectomy is indicated, the type of IBD
involved determines which surgical options are appropriate.
Surgery (total colectomy) does represent a cure in UC, though
a dramatic one. In CD, surgery is never curative. Continent
procedures such as the ileorectal pull-through (mucosal
proctectomy) or the Kock pouch may be desirable in UC, but
are contraindicated in CD.The availability of a diagnostic marker that would
readily distinguish UC from CD of the colon and other
colitides would represent a major clinical advance. A
convenient and reliable blood test which might parallel
disease activity or even predict an impending flare of
activity would provide a tremendous

A method of measuring the presence or absence of peri-nuclear
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies

(p-ANCA) of ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing
cholangitis in a sample, said method comprising:


(a) contacting the sample and a detectable secondary antibody
with immobilized neutrophil(s) rendered permeable

to DNase under conditions suitable to form a complex of
neutrophil, p-ANCA and detectable secondary antibody,

wherein said immobilized neutrophil(s) is subjected to
DNase under conditions sufficient to cause substantially

complete digestion of cellular DNA without significant
loss of nuclear or cellular morphology prior

to said contacting step;
(b) separating unbound secondary antibody from the complex;
(c) assaying for the presence or absence of p-ANCA containing
complex by measuring the presence or absence of

bound secondary antibody, compared to a control,
wherein said control is the result of repeating the

steps of the present method on a sample from the same
source, except that the neutrophil(s) of step (a) is

not subjected to DNase.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the conditions
sufficient to cause substantially complete digestion of

cellular DNA, without substantial loss of nuclear or
cellular morphology, comprise incubating said neutrophil(s)

in a concentration of DNase of about 2 to 10
units of DNase per milliliter of buffer for a time in

the range of about 15 minutes to one hour at a temperature
in the range of about 22°C to 40°C. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the sample and
the secondary antibody are sequentially contacted with

immobilized neutrophil(s) of step (a).
A method according to claim 1, wherein the sample and
the secondary antibody are simultaneously contacted

with immobilized neutrophil(s) of step (a).
A method according to claim 1, wherein the secondary
antibody is anti-IgG.
A method according to claim 1, wherein the neutrophil(s)
is human neutrophil(s), the sample is human

blood serum and the secondary antibody is anti-human

A method according to claim 1, wherein the secondary
antibody is a combination of antibodies and wherein at

least one secondary antibody is detectable.

alkaline phosphatase and the substrate for enzymatic

conversion is para-nitrophenyl phosphate.
