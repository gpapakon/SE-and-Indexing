<ABSTRACT>
An adiabatic dynamic non-inverter circuit provides a logic level signal 
and its inverse simultaneously in dynamic logic circuitry without significant power 

dissipation. The principles of this non-inverter circuit may be used to create an 
exclusive-or gate which also does not dissipate significant power. A non-inverter 

circuit comprises an input node (92), an output node (86) first and second clock 
nodes (88,-) for receiving first and second periodic adiabatically varying clock 

signals, and first and second controllable switches (84,85) of opposite conductivity 
types in series between one (88) of the clock nodes and the output node (86), the first 

switch (84) having a control terminal responsive to the other of the clock nodes and 
the second switch having a control terminal (92) responsive to the input node, and a 

rectifier (90) connected between the output node (86) and the one clock node (88).

<DESCRIPTION>
Application Serial No. 94303533.7 of Alex G. 
Dickinson, entitled Adiabatic Dynamic Logic, filed on the 
same day this application is being filed. Application Serial No. 94303535.2 of John S. Denker, 
entitled Adiabatic Dynamic Precharge Boost Circuitry, 
filed on the same day this application is being filed. The detailed description in the 94303533.7 
application may be helpful to the reader in understanding 
the principles of this invention. Accordingly, that 
description is substantially reproduced in this 
application. This invention relates to logic circuitry. More 
specifically, this invention relates to noninverting 
circuitry, and related circuitry such as exclusive-or 
gates, having low power consumption and simplified 
topology. In standard logic circuitry, such as static and 
dynamic CMOS logic, nodes are charged and discharged in a 
completely irreversible, dissipative manner, using a 
switch to charge a node to a first potential and to 
discharge the node to a second potential. It has been 
proposed to attach such a node to a slew rate limited 
clock which in theory gradually, adiabatically, and 
reversibly charges and discharges the node. Logic 
circuitry using this technique is currently too 
complicated and uses too many transistors so that at 
normal speeds of operation any power savings for each 
transistor may be lost by the fact that many more  
 
transistors are used to accomplish simple logical 
operations. In addition, it has not been possible to 
completely avoid nonadiabatic transitions in some prior 
designs. The total power consumption of the entire 
circuit thus may not be much less than that used by 
nonadiabatic circuitry. Application Serial No. 94303533.7 cross-referenced 
above discloses and claims adiabatic dynamic logic 
circuitry which has reduced power dissipation and 
complexity. In order to increase the usefulness of 
circuitry in accordance with that invention, a novel and 
improved adiabatic dynamic non-inverter circuit has been 
developed. In one example, an adiabatic dynamic non-inverter 
circuit comprises an input node which receives an input 
signal having one of two states and an output node which 
produces an output signal having the same state as the 
input signal. A first clock node receives a first 
periodic clock signal adiabatically varying at 
predetermined rates of change between first and second 
potential levels. A second clock node receives a second 
periodic clock signal adiabatically varying at 
predetermined rates of change between third and
