<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for encapsulating with plastic lead frames having chips arranged thereon comprises mutually movable mould halves (102, 103). In the closed position a mould cavity is bounded, in which moulding material is arranged under pressure via a runner. The pressure is provided by a plunger-cylinder (134-133) which carries up the moulding material. Leaking moulding material can result in adhering of the plunger to the cylinder wall, which is prevented according to the invention in that the outer wall of the plunger (134) is provided with scraping edges which scrape clean the inner wall of the cylinder (133) during operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for 
encapsulating with plastic lead frames having chips arranged 
thereon, comprising mutually movable mould halves which 
bound a mould cavity in the closed position, a runner 
connecting onto the mould cavity for feeding moulding 
material and a plunger-cylinder connecting onto the runner 
for carrying up the moulding material under pressure. Such an apparatus is known from, among others, 
EP-A-0 428 792. DE-B-1,103,011 discloses a injection apparatus 
having a piston, the piston head whereof is provided with 
helically scraping edges. In US-A-2,783,499 it is remarked that press 
material will not adhere to the inner surface of the 
cylinder as it is scraped off by the press disc itself. The problem with this known apparatus is that 
material can leak along the plunger which carries up the 
moulding material, which can result in adhering of the 
plunger to the cylinder wall. This has the consequence of 
considerable wear and operational disturbances. The invention has for its object to find a 
solution herefor. This is achieved according to the invention in 
that the outer wall of the plunger helically running grooves 
the depth of which increases as seen from the drive side of 
the plunger. As a result of the steps according to the 
invention the inner wall of the cylinder is scraped clean 
during operation such that adhering no longer occurs. With the plunger according to the invention a 
comparatively large guide surface is obtained between 
plunger and inner wall cylinder, while due to the helically 
running grooves a sharp scraping edge is still achieved for 
scraping away the plastic material that can result in 
adhering.  
 The plunger is preferably driven by a drive rod which 
is pivotally coupled to the plunger The pivot point between 
the plunger and the drive rod is preferably formed by a ball 
joint. The invention will be elucidated with reference to 
the drawings. 
Fig. 1 shows a cut away view of the apparatus 
according to the invention, fig. 2 shows on a larger scale a detail of the lower-most 
part of the moulding apparatus according to fig. 1; fig. 3a and 3b show sectional views of the plunger 
and plunger bar according to the invention, fig. 4 shows a view of the plunger according to the 
invention, fig. 5 shows respectively a view along the line A-A 
and B-B in fig. 4, and fig. 6 shows a sectional view. A description of the moulding apparatus according to 
the invention will be given with reference to fig. 1 and 2. Mounted on the frame 100 of
