<ABSTRACT>
A granular colorant produced by mixing an astaxanthin-containing extract from 
Phaffia rhodozyma
 yeast with 
a coating medium and granulating and drying the formed mixture. The colorant has a high astaxanthin content, can 

be homogeneously dispersed (or is freely flowable), does not cause dusting, and is excellent in stability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to powder and 
glanular materials containing astaxanthin extracted oil of 
Phaffia rhodozyma yeast. The powder and glanular materials 
of the invention are useful for coloring to make attractive 
the skin and meat of salmon, trout, red sea-bream, gold 
fish, prawn and the like and the feather of red canary as 
well as fortification of the nutrient values of the meats of 
such fishes. It is well known that, when carotenoids such as 
astaxanthin and vitamin are added to feeds as color 
improvers and nutrient fortifiers, it is important to have 
them uniformly mixed and dispersed in the feeds. Liquid-like 
or wax-like substances are defective with regard to 
uniform dispersibility, hence, preferred are powder and 
glanular materials. As examples in which animals and plants are used as 
color improvers as astaxanthin pigment sources, there are  
 
mentioned meal-like dried products or oils extracted from 
crustacea such as krill or dried matters of or oils 
extracted from Phaffia rhodozyma yeast, but most widely used 
are meal-like dried products or dried yeasts, and these are 
in the form of powder and granule. Also when carotenoids such as astaxanthin 
chemically synthesized under substantially pure conditions 
are used as color improvers, they are processed into the 
form of powder and granule. It is, however, not that they are good if their 
form is powdery or granular, and further requirements are, 
among others, enough astaxanthin content from the viewpoint 
of quantity handled or transported, free fluidity for 
enhancement of uniform dispersibility and powder properties 
safe from dusting during handling. If fluidity is poor, it 
is possible that proper addition is infeasible during 
pelletization of feeds by the use of adding apparatus 
generally and conventionally used. Such astaxanthin content 
and powder properties are strongly desired by feed 
manufacturers. Although the aforementioned meal-like dried 
products and dried yeasts are in the form of powder and 
granule, the astaxanthin content is not sufficient because 
of the presence of a large amount of protein and the like 
constituting cells. Also their powder properties are not  
 
preferable because they are poor in fluidity and in the 
form of micro-powder. Thus, when animals and plants containing 
astaxanthin and their processed goods are added for color 
improvement and/or nutrient fortification, they are poor in 
astaxanthin content and powder properties. The carotenoids such as astaxanthin, regardless of
