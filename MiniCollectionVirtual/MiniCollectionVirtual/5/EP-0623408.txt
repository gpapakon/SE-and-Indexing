<ABSTRACT>
A method for the manufacture of a metal element (2) for 
a joint, the metal element (2) having a head (3) for 

coupling with a body of the joint and a shank (4) 
integral with the head (3) and having a blind hole (11) 

for positive engagement by a control member for the metal 
element (2); the method including the steps of producing 

a substantially cylindrical piece (17) of metal, of 
permanently cold deforming a first end portion (50) of 

the piece (17) by means of at least one first forming 
assembly (23, 24, 25) so as to form the head (3) and of 

cold extruding a second end portion (80) of the piece 
(17) so as to form the shank (4) and the blind axial hole 

(11) by means of at least one second forming assembly 
(26, 27).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plant for the
manufacture of a metal element for a joint, in particular
for a ball joint.The present invention may be applied to advantage, but
not exclusively, to the manufacture of a metal element of
the type intended to be connected to one end of a drive
rod and which includes a head with a seat for receiving
a portion of another element of the ball joint and a
shank which is usually cylindrical and is integral with
the head. The shank generally has a blind hole which
extends from the opposite end of the shank from the head
and is adapted for positive engagement by the end portion
of an associated drive rod.Normally, the joint element described above is
manufactured mechanically, by machine-shaving from a rod,
preferably a circular-section rod. However, this method
of manufacture is extremely expensive, a fact which is
not of negligible importance in the case of large scale
production. In fact, during this machine-shaving, a
considerable quantity of material is not used as it forms
the shavings, which are very expensive to recover.
Furthermore the manufacturing process described above
requires the use of a considerable number of machine 
tools assembled in work stations which, in addition to
being relatively expensive in themselves, carry not
inconsiderable operating and maintenance costs which
noticeably increase the unit cost of the manufactured
joint.Alternatively, the joint element described above is
manufactured by a series of operations including a first
working process constituted by permanent hot deformation,
in which a semifinished product is formed from a piece of
rod and has a geometry similar to that of the piece to be
manufactured, and a second operation involving the
removal of shavings.This manufacturing process is highly unsatisfactory as it
places a ceiling on the production rate. In fact, the
manufacturing process described above requires
considerable time to heat the pieces of rod to the
working temperature, as well as particular technical
arrangements for preserving the material's initial
characteristics substantially unaltered. In addition,
the various operations carried out on the piece of rod
require the use of special handling equipment as the rod
is at different temperatures in the different steps of
the working cycle. Furthermore, the construction of the undercut portions of such metal elements for
joints is particularly difficult. A prior art process for the manufacture of a metal element for a joint is described in US-A-5
129 251. In
