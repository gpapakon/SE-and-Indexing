<ABSTRACT>
Securing device for objects, for example metal sheets, plates, profiles or substrates, which are joined together, such that they are bonded against one another over their surfaces, by means of elastic adhesives. The object are joined together by means of an adhesive which may be, for example, an adhesive tape which adheres on both sides. One object has cutouts and pin-like elements, which are fixed in the second element, engage through the cutouts. The pin-like elements have a head which is flush with the surface of the first element or is at a small distance therefrom. The diameter of the head is greater than the diameter of the cutout. The diameter of the body of the pin-like element is smaller than the diameter of the cutout. The adhesive connection permits, in the case of high loading, minimal horizontal displacement of the objects with respect to one another, but prevents vertical displacement of the objects with respect to one another. In the event of high stressing and the occurrence of peeling forces, the adhesive bonding is assisted by the securing device.
