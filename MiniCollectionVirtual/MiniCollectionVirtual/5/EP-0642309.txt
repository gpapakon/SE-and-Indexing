<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to methods and apparatus for preserving fluid foodstuffs, and more particularly, is directed to such methods and apparatus for extending the shelf life of perishable fluid foodstuffs such as dairy products, fruit juices and liquid egg products, which are growth media for microorganisms. The present invention is also directed to preserved liquid foodstuffs which have extended shelf life.

 EIGH PULSED VOLTAGE SYSTEM8 FOR EXTENDING THE SHELF LIFE OF PUMPABLE FOOD PRODUCTSThe present invention is directed to methods and apparatus for preserving fluid foodstuffs, and more particularly is directed to such methods and apparatus for extending the shelf life of perishable fluid foodstuffs such as dairy products, fruit juices and liquid egg products, which are growth media for micro- organisms. The present invention is also directed to preserved liquid foodstuffs which have extended shelf life.Substantial technical effort has been directed to the preservation of perishable fluid food products such as milk products, natural fruit juices and liquid egg products which may normally contain a wide variety of micro-organisms, and which are excellent culture media for microorganisms.Practical preservation methods which have found significant commercial application predominantly utilize heat treatment such as pasteurization to inactivate or reduce the microorganism population. For example, milk products are conventionally pasteurized at a minimum temperature of at least about 72* C. for 15 seconds (or 

equivalent time/temperature relationship) to destroy pathogenic bacteria and most of the nonpathogenic organisms, with degradative enzyme systems also being partial or totally inactivated. However, products processed in this manner are still generally nonsterile and have limited shelf life, even at refrigeration temperntutrβ. The shelf life of liquid foodstuffs may be substantially extended by higher heat treatment processes such as "ultra high pasteurization", or "ultra high temperature ("UHT") such as treatment of from about 94* C. for 3 seconds to about 150* C. for one second in conjunction with aseptic packaging to achieve complete destruction of all bacteria and spores. However, such heat treatment typically adversely affects the flavor of the food product, at least partially denatures its protein content or otherwise adversely affects desired properties of the fluid food product. Other approaches to liquid food preservation, which also have certain disadvantages, include the use of chemical additives or ionizing radiation.The bactericidal effects of electric currents have also been investigated since the end of the 19th century, with various efforts having been made to utilize electrical currents for treating food products, such as described in U.S. Patents 1,900,509, 2,428,328, 2,428,329 and 4,457,221 and German Patents 1,946,267 and 2,907,887.

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. Pulsed electric field treatment apparatus for preservation of a pumpable foodstuff comprising: an electric field treatment chamber comprising a first electrode means including an electro-chemically inert conductor for making electrical contact with pumpable foodstuff disposed adjacent said first electrode means in said treatment chamber, and a second electrode means spaced apart from said first electrode means, said second electrode means including an electro-chemically inert conductor for making electrical contact with pumpable foodstuff disposed in said treatment chamber between said first electrode means and said second electrode means; inlet conduit means for introducing a pumpable foodstuff to be treated into said electric field treatment chamber and outlet conduit means for discharging food product which has passed through said treatment chamber; means for applying high voltage electrical pulses to said first and second electrode meanε at a rate of at least about 0.01 pulse per second to provide an electric field between said electrodes through a pumpable foodstuff located therebetween in said treatment chamber of at least about 25,000 volts per centimeter; and means for pumping a pumpable foodstuff through said inlet conduit means at a rate such that all of said pumpable foodstuff is subjected to at leaεt one pulse in transit through said treatment chamber before it is conducted from the treatment chamber through said outlet conduit means.
2. Pulsed electric field treatment apparatus in accordance with Claim 1 wherein at least one of said first and said second electrodes comprised an electro- chemically inert material selected from the group consisting of gold, platinum and metal oxides. 


 3. Pulsed electric field treatment apparatus in accordance with Claim 2 wherein said metal oxides are selected from a group consisting of iridium oxide and ruthenium oxide.
4. Pulsed electric field treatment apparatus in accordance with Claim 1 wherein at least one of said firεt and second electrodes comprises a conductive substrate coated with an electro-chemically inert material selected from the group consiεting of gold, platinum and metal oxides.
5. Pulsed electric field treatment apparatus in accordance with Claim 4 wherein said metal oxides are selected from a group consisting of iridium oxide and ruthenium oxide.
