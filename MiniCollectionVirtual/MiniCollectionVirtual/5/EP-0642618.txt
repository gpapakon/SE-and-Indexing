<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to edging strips for 
floorcoverings whereby said coverings can be fixedly 
located along their edges to an underlying floor surface 
and is a development of my invention described and claimed 
in UK Patent Specification No. 2250192 which was published after 
the priority date of this application. Floor edging strips can be used for fixing 
floorcovering around its edges closely adjacent the walls 
of a room, or they can be used as dividers between two 
floor areas having different coverings, e.g. between a 
tiled floor and a carpet or vinyl flooring. A particular disadvantage of known edging strips is 
that they tend to project above the surface of the 
floorcoverings and, even if they are rounded-off, vehicles 
passing across the strips tend to be bumped. In 
circumstances where the vehicles are intended to carry 
fragile articles, or hospital patients, this is clearly 
undesirable. Furthermore, repeated bumping causes the 
floorcovering to be damaged or broken down. In my UK-PS 2250192 there is described a method of 
securing an edge of a floorcovering fitted to an 
underlying floor surface which is characterised by 
providing an elongate edging strip comprising a housing 
strip and an insert strip which are interfitted together 
via co-operating locking means formed on said strips, 
selecting the material of said insert strip to be of a 
plastics which will readily bond with the underside of the  
 
floorcovering, fixing said edging strip along said floor 
surface to define a line along which said edge of said 
floorcovering is to extend so that said housing and insert 
strips present respective upstanding edges which extend 
parallel and adjacent each other along said line flush 
with the surface of the floorcovering when fitted and the 
insert further presenting a support surface for said edge 
of the floorcovering, cutting the floorcovering to present 
an edge which overlies the support surface of the insert 
strip and abuts said upstanding edge of the insert strip, 
and bonding the underside of said floorcovering along said 
edge to said surface and upstanding edge of the insert 
strip. My UK-PS 2250192 also describes preferred 
embodiments of edging strips adapted to the method. In 
these preferred embodiments, the interlocking means 
generally comprises a locking projection extending along 
one edge of the insert strip for engaging in a 
co-operating end recess in the housing strip and at least 
one tongue extending along the other edge of the insert 
strip which
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An edging strip for securing floorcovering along an 
edge thereof to an underlying surface and comprising a 

pair of elongate housing and insert strips (2,3) which are 
adapted to interfit with each other, the housing strip (2) 

having an upstanding edge (4) of a height which is 
determined by the thickness of floorcovering (5) to be 

fitted whereby said edge will be flush with the surface of 
the floorcovering when fitted, and the insert strip (3) 

being of a plastics material to which the underside of the 
floorcovering can be readily bonded, said insert strip 

presenting a surface (21) for supporting the underside of 
the floorcovering along an edge thereof and an upstanding 

edge (12) the height of which is also determined by the 
floorcovering thickness to be flush with the surface of 

the floorcovering when fitted, said edge providing an 
abutment face for the floorcovering edge, and co-operating 

interlocking means (24, 25) provided on respective housing 
and insert strips whereby the insert strip can be fixedly 

located on the housing strip, wherein said 
co-operating interlocking means comprise the housing strip 

(2) being of generally U-shaped cross section, one side 
wall (17) of which is higher than the other side wall (18) 

by an amount substantially equal to or greater than the 
floorcovering thickness, in that the insert strip (3) is 

of generally "L" shape, the horizontal limb (19) of which 

is adapted to fit within the groove (20) defined in said 
housing strip with its vertical limb (22) adjacent said 

one side wall (17) and of a height substantially equal to 
the height of said one wall, the  

 
horizontal limb providing an upper surface, substantially 

level with or above the height of said other wall (18) of 
the housing strip, in that said one wall (17) of the 

housing strip is shaped to provide a mating recess (25) 
for at least one projection (24) from the vertical limb of 

said insert strip, and in that the other wall (18) of said 
housing strip provides a further mating recess for a 

locking projection in the free edge (23) of the horizontal 
limb of said insert strip. 
An edging strip according to Claim 1, 
wherein said projection (24) is resilient to enable the 

insert strip to be fitted by pressing down along its 
length, and in that one wall (17) of the housing strip (2) 

is of appropriate thickness and inclined to enable it to 
flex during fixing of the insert strip (3) to facilitate 

snap fitting of said resilient projection (24) into its 
mating recess (25). 
An edging strip according to Claim 1, or Claim 2, 
wherein a series of projections (24) and 

mating recesses (25) are provided. 
A floor surface covering, 
wherein at least one edge of said floor covering 

(5) is secured by an edging strip according to any one 
of Claim 1 to 3.
