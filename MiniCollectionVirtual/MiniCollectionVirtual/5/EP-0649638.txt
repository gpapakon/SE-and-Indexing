<ABSTRACT>
A graft protection device suitable for protecting a 
bone-tendon-bone graft used during anterior cruciate ligament 

reconstruction. The graft protection device comprises a distal 
blocking member, a proximal releasable holding sleeve and an 

elongated connecting portion connecting the blocking member with 
the holding sleeve. A radially extending handle is attached to 

the holding sleeve in order to enable a user to longitudinally 
and rotationally position the graft protection device along the 

shaft of an elongated driver when the device is inserted through 
an opening into a joint. A method of utilizing the graft 

protection device is also disclosed comprising the steps of 
guiding a screw/driver/protector assembly along a guide wire into 

proper position within a bone tunnel, driving the screw into 
place by turning it and thereby sliding it along the blocking 

member past a portion of the ligament graft and then locking the 
guide wire to the driver and removing it along with the 

driver/protector assembly in a single motion. A lockable, 
cannulated screw driver is disclosed to facilitate using the 

graft protection device with the method disclosed herein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to surgical devices and in 
particular to instruments used in the arthroscopic repair of 
ligaments such as anterior cruciate ligaments. More particularly, 
the invention relates to instruments for securing grafts 
such as artificial natural or prosthetic ligaments in bone 
tunnels while protecting the ligament from damaging by the 
securing device. As new procedures and instruments continue to be 
developed for arthroscopically repairing knee ligaments such as 
anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) and posterior cruciate 
ligaments (PCLs) and as surgeons become familiar with these 
existing procedures, the need for other new devices becomes 
apparent. For example, it is becoming fairly common to repair an 
ACL with an autograft ligament formed of bone-tendon-bone 
harvested from the patient's patellar bone, patellar tendon and 
bone from the tibial tuberosity. Such a graft ligament (which 
may be an allograft) takes the form of an elongated, natural 
ligament which has generally rectangularly shaped natural bone  
 
blocks at each end. One procedure for accomplishing an 
arthroscopic ACL repair with such a graft ligament is disclosed 
in U.S. Patent RE 34,293 (Goble et al.), incorporated by 
reference herein, which describes a surgical method comprising 
the steps of securing a natural or prosthetic ligament 
endosteally within a "blind" tunnel segment formed in the femur 
and an aligned tunnel segment formed in the tibia, both tunnel 
segments formed through a single incision. In addition to the 
various ligament fixation devices disclosed in the aforementioned 
patent, many ACL repair procedures utilize bone-tendon-bone 
grafts secured by cannulated interference screws guided along 
elongated guide pins or guide wires into the space between the 
tunnel wall and the adjacent bone block in order to create an 
interference fit to retain the bone block within the tunnel. 
Such a procedure is described in U.S. Patent 4,927,421 (Goble et 
al.), also incorporated by reference herein. As surgeons have become adept at performing the aforementioned 
procedures, a need has become apparent for an 
improvement by providing a means to protect the graft or 
artificial ligament as it is being secured within the bone 
tunnel. Utilizing prior art devices it has been found that the 
ligament portion of the graft may occasionally be inadvertently 
cut or nicked by the interference screw threads, thus weakening 
the attachment of the artificial ligament within the bone. One 
type of graft protection
