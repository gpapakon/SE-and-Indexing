<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a scrubbing tower for a flue gas desulphurisation plant having an absorption zone, a scrubbing liquid sump (2), a device (13) for feeding additives into the scrubbing liquid sump (2) and a circulation device (9) connected to the scrubbing liquid sump. The circulation device (9) has at least one suction line (10) connected to the upper region of the scrubbing liquid sump (2), a pump (11) and a plurality of backwash lines (12). According to the invention, the cylindrical scrubbing liquid sump (2) has a flat bottom (8). The backwash lines (12) of the circulation device (9) operating in a steady state mode of the scrubbing tower open out into the scrubbing liquid sump (2) in the vicinity of the bottom. The device (13) for feeding additives is connected to the circulation device (9).

<CLAIMS>
A scrubbing tower for a flue gas 
desulphurisation installation, having 


an absorption zone (1) through which flue gas flows 
and which is impinged upon by scrubbing liquid, 
a scrubbing liquid sump (2) disposed under the 
absorption zone (1), 
a horizontal grid (4) of oxygen feed lines in the 
scrubbing liquid sump, which grid separates an 

oxidation zone (5) above the grid from a reaction 
zone (6) below the grid, 
a device (13) for the supply of additives into the 
reaction zone of the scrubbing liquid sump, 
a device (3) for recycling scrubbing liquid from the 
scrubbing liquid sump into the absorption zone, and 
an additional circulating device (9) connected to the 
scrubbing liquid sump, 
 
wherein a suspension mainly consisting of calcium sulphate can 

be transferred out of the reaction zone and wherein the 
circulating device comprises at least one suction line (10) 

connected to the upper region of the scrubbing liquid sump, a 
pump (11) and a plurality of back-flushing lines (12) leading 

back into the lower region of the reaction zone, characterised 
in that the cylindrical scrubbing liquid sump (2) has a flat  

 
base (8), that the back-flushing lines (12) of the circulating 

device (9), which operates during the steady-state operation 
of the scrubbing tower, are disposed distributed on the 

container shell (7) of the scrubbing liquid sump (2) in the 
vicinity of the base, and that the device (13) for supplying 

additives is connected to the circulating device (9), so that 
the additives can be introduced into the reaction zone (6) via 

the back-flushing lines (12). 
A scrubbing tower according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the back-flushing lines (12) are 

disposed distributed on the container shell (7) in the 
vicinity of the base, wherein one part of the back-flushing 

lines (12) is aligned tangentially in relation to the 
container shell (7) and the other part of the back-flushing 

lines (12) is aligned radially in relation thereto. 
A scrubbing tower according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the back-flushing lines (12) are 

disposed in the vicinity of the base and uniformly distributed 
over the area of the base (8), wherein their outlet ends (20) 

are oriented towards the flat base (8) of the scrubbing tower. 
A scrubbing tower according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the outlet ends (20) are oriented 

vertically towards the flat base (8). 
A scrubbing tower according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the distance of each outlet end (20) 

from the flat base is 10-30 times the diameter of the free  
 

outlet cross-section of each outlet end, and that the total 
volume flow emerging from the back-flushing lines (12) can be 

adjusted to a value of 5 to 15 m
3
/m
2
h with respect to the area 
of the scrubbing tower base. 
A scrubbing tower according to any one of claims 
1 to 5, characterised in that a suspension take-off line (14) 

which has a control valve (15) and which leads to a dewatering 
device is connected to the circulating device (9) on the pump 

pressure side, wherein a partial suspension stream which 
mainly consists of calcium sulphate can be transferred out 

periodically or continuously. 
A scrubbing tower according to any one of claims 
1 to 6, characterised in that the device (13) for supplying 

additives is connected to the circulating device (9) on the 
pump pressure side and behind the suspension take-off line 

(14) in the direction of flow. 
A scrubbing tower according to any one of claims 
1 to 7, characterised in that the suction line (10) is 

connected to the scrubbing liquid sump (2) at a short distance 
below the grid (4) of oxygen supply lines. 
A scrubbing tower according to any one of claims 
1 to 8, characterised in that the circulating device (9) is
