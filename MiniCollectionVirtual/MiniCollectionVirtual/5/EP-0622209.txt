<ABSTRACT>
An intrusion of air (22) into the ink chambers (24) of a printhead substrate (50) is a 
symptom of either a depleted ink supply (26) or a deprimed printhead substrate 

(50). When the printer (20) attempts to print with a depleted ink supply (30) or a 
deprimed printhead substrate (50), the printhead substrate (50) must absorb all of 

the energy dissipated in the ink chambers (24) to eject the drops. This causes the 

printhead substrate (50) to reach high temperatures. The present invention detects 
a depleted ink supply (26) and a deprimed printhead (50) by monitoring the 

temperature of the printhead substrate (50) and comparing this temperature with a 
threshold (84, 90, 96). When this temperature exceeds the threshold (84, 90, 96) 

for more than an allotted amount of time, then corrective action is taken.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to application Serial No. 08/056,330,
entitled "Densitometer" filed on 30 April 1993
(US 5 414 453, US 5 608 439)
and application
Serial No. 08/056,243, entitled "Pen Start-Up Algorithm for
Black and Color Thermal Ink Jet Pens" filed on 30 April 1993,
published as US-A-545568 on 03/10/95.This invention relates generally to the field of ink jet printing and more
particularly to adequate ink flow into the ink chambers of an ink jet printhead.Ink jet printers have gained wide acceptance. These printers are described by
W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in "Ink Jet Devices," Chapter 13 of Output Hardcopy
Devices (Ed. R.C. Durbeck and S. Sherr, Academic Press, San Diego, 1988)
and by U.S. Patent 4,490,728. Ink jet printers produce high quality print, are
compact and portable, and print quickly but quietly because only ink strikes the
paper. The major categories of ink jet printer technology include continuous ink
jet, intermittent ink jet, and drop on demand ink jet. The drop on demand
category can be further broken down into piezoelectric ink jet printers and
thermal ink jet printers. Drop on demand ink jet printers produce drops by
rapidly decreasing the volume of a small ink chamber to initiate a pressure 
wave which forces a single drop through the nozzle. Capillary action causes
the ink chamber to refill. The typical ink jet printhead has an array of precisely
formed nozzles attached to an ink jet printhead substrate that incorporates an
array of ink chambers that receive liquid ink (i.e., colorants dissolved or
dispersed in a solvent) from an ink reservoir. In thermal ink jet printheads, each
ink chamber has a thin-film resistor, known as a "firing resistor", located near
or opposite the nozzle so ink can collect between it and the nozzle. When
electric printing pulses heat the firing resistor, a small portion of the ink near it
vaporizes and ejects a drop of ink from the printhead. In piezoelectric ink jet
printheads, each ink chamber has a piezoelectric transducer located near or
opposite the nozzle so ink can collect between it and the nozzle. When electric
printing pulses deflect the diaphragm of the piezoelectric transducer, a drop of
ink ejects from the nozzle. Properly arranged nozzles form a dot matrix pattern.
Properly sequencing the operation of each nozzle causes characters or images
to form on the paper as the printhead moves past the paper.Previously existing ink jet printers can not detect depletion of their ink supply
and consequently, they sometimes attempt to print with
