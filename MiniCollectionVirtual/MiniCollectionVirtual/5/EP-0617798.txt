<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the 
prediction of weather disturbances and, more particularly, 
to the prediction of weather disturbances that give rise to 
microburst wind shear conditions at low altitudes over the 
earth's surface which are hazardous to aircraft during 
takeoff and landing. A microburst is a powerful downward blast of air, 
usually associated with a thunderstorm or rain, followed by 
wind shear, a violent horizontal burst of air in all 
directions at low altitudes. Wind shear, which is 
extremely hazardous during aircraft takeoffs and landings, 
occurs over a relatively small region and typically lasts 5 
to 15 minutes. Prior art systems, such as that disclosed by Atlas in 
U.S.Patent Re.33,152 entitled "Radar Detection of Hazardous 
Small Scale Weather Disturbances", detect the occurrence of 
a microburst utilizing two overlapping antenna beams at 
elevation angles near ground level and track its path along 
the ground to give warnings of approaching wind shear at 
locations remote from the detection position. These 
systems do not provide information of the vertical and 
horizontal wind velocities at heights above the ground 
level from which a pending microburst, its time to impact, 
and its impact location may be forecast. Should the initial 
impact of a microburst be in the vicinity of an airport, 
runway, disastrous consequences may ensue.  
 A system for providing an early warning of wind shear 
conditions is disclosed by W. L. Rubin et al in U.S. Patent 
Application 07/683,356 entitled "Microburst Precursor 
Detection Utilizing Microwave Radar"and is assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention. In accordance with this 
prior art, early warning of wind shear conditions is 
provided by detecting the vertical wind downdraft during 
its descent before it reaches ground level and establishes 
the conditions that generate wind shear. Vertical wind 
downdraft is determined by extracting four weather 
parameters from received signals of a scanning single beam 
or vertically stacked multiple beam microwave doppler radar 
system which illuminates a preselected altitude range for a 
predetermined distance about an airport. The number of 
beams of the doppler radar system and their beamwidths are 
designed to provide coverage over the preselected altitude 
range in a manner that establishes a vertical and 
horizontal limit for each range cell of the doppler radar  
 
system for all slant ranges that are less than a 
predetermined distance. The horizontal limit is
