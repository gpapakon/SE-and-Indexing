<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a semiconductor device for 
converting light and radiations into electricity, such as a 
PIN diode, an APD diode, a photodiode array, a micro-strip 
sensor, and so on, in particular to effective structures and 
applications of a semiconductor device for measuring high 
energy radiations, e.g. X-rays and γ rays. Conventionally, such a detecting device consists of a 
first conductive type semiconductor substrate, i.e. an N⁻ 
type-semiconductor substrate 28001, and a second conductive 
type impurity region, i.e. a P⁺ type impurity region 28005 
deposited on the substrate, as shown by Fig.28. In Fig.28, if the surface having the P⁺ type impurity 
region 28005 (which is described as P⁺ type layer hereafter) 
is defined as a front surface of a device, an N⁺ type 
impurity region (which is described as an N⁺ type layer 
hereafter) 28009 which has a much higher impurity  
 
concentration than the N⁻ type substrate is deposited on a 
rear surface of the substrate. Hence, the prior device is 
so called a planar-type PIN diode having a PN junction 
consisting of P⁺-N⁻-N⁺. An intrinsic semiconductor includes an impurity 
concentration of from 1×10¹² to 1×10¹³ atms/cm³. For 
example, 1×10¹² atms/cm³ is described as "1E12" by omitting 
the unit of atms/cm³. The diode is called as PiN or PIN 
where i or I is originated in i of the word "intrinsic". An anode 28003 is formed on the P⁺ type layer. An N⁺ type layer 28008 which becomes a channel stopper 
is formed on the front surface of the substrate. It is 
possible to form a cathode 28002 on the N⁺ type layer on the 
same surface as the P⁺ type layer. An i layer has a low impurity concentration and a 
thickness of the i layer is from several dozens to several 
hundreds of µm. Such a PIN diode has a smaller junction 
capacitance than other PN diodes because of a big thickness 
of the depletion layer, when a reverse bias is supplied to 
the PN junction. The PIN photodiodes are widely utilized due 
to the high-speed response. This invention will be explained 
mainly by referring to a PIN diode as an example. Fig.29 shows a perspective view of a chip of the  
 
conventional PIN photodiode. An anode 28003 and a cathode 
28002 are arrayed on the chip. The size of the chip, i.e. a 
side size of the chip, is about from several millimeters to 
several centimeters. A size of a detecting surface 28004 is 
a little smaller than the size of chip side 28006. Fig.30A is a perspective view of a finished product 
which is called "a mounted photodiode", wherein
