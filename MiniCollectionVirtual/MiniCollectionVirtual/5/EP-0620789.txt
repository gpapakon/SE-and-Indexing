<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum power brake for motor vehicles has a control valve (12) which can be actuated by an electromagnet (20) independently from an actuating rod (7) which pushes a valve piston (9). The electromagnet (20) actuates a third sealing seat (24), allowing the working chamber (3) to be vented. In order to keep the external actuating force to be supplied by the electromagnet (20) as low as possible, the electromagnet (20) is slidingly arranged in the control housing (5) and is fixed to the valve piston (9), so that the third sealing seat (24) is synchronically movable with the valve piston (9).
