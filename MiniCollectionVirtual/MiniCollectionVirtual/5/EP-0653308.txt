<ABSTRACT>
In order to indicate more distinctly the results of transverse and 
longitudinal adjustments of a print image, a standard print position 

indication mark showing a printing master being positioned at the 
standard position relative to a print sheet and a biased print position 

indication mark showing a biased position of the printing master in 
either or both of the transverse and longitudinal directions relative to 

the standard position are expressed as marks each including at least 
two straight lines perpendicular to one another, and the biased print 

position indication mark is biased in the transverse and/or longitudinal 
directions according to a corresponding biasing of the printing master 

relative to the print sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an art of controlling printing
means in printers or copiers, and more particularly to a device for
indicating the results of adjustment by an adjusting means for adjusting
the position of a print image relative to a print sheet in the printing
means.When a print image is applied to a print sheet by a printing
means of a stencil printer or a copier adapted for use in offices, it is
often desired that the transverse and/or longitudinal position of the
print image relative to the print sheet is changed from the transverse
and/or longitudinal position of an original image in a printing master or
an original. In the art of electronic copiers it has been developed to
adjust the longitudinal position of a print image relative to a print sheet
through a step of electronic signal processing such that the longitudinal
position of a print image relative to a print sheet is adjusted by a key
operation made with reference to a linear scale. However, since an
adjustment of the transverse position of a print image relative to a
print sheet is relatively readily available by adjusting the transverse
position of an original in the case of copiers, the art of adjusting the
transverse position by keys does not yet appear to have been applied to
copiers. In the art of stencil printing, when the perforation of a
stencil sheet is carried out by a perforating means different from a
printer such that a perforated stencil sheet is mounted around a
printing drum by a manual operation as in the conventional stencil
printers, an adjustment of the transverse position of a print image is
relatively readily available by appropriately adjusting the transverse
position of mounting the stencil sheet to the printing drum. However,
with the development of a stencil printer which integrally incorporates
a stencil perforation means therein, it has become necessary that an
adjustment of the transverse position of a print image is made at the
stage of setting an original for perforation of a stencil sheet when the
perforation of the stencil sheet is carried out by the conventional art
of laying an original and a stencil sheet one over the other, or a 
transverse adjustment of a print image is made while viewing a
monitor screen of a word processor or the like when a stencil sheet
is perforated by an electric input from the word processor or the like.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a print image position indication device which provides an
operator with a pleasant and effective indication of

<CLAIMS>
A print image position indication device for indicating the results of
adjustment of a print image position in a printer capable of adjusting a

transverse position and a longitudinal position of a print image relative
to a print sheet, comprising a standard print position indication mark

(314) including at least two straight lines perpendicular to one another
for indicating respectively a transverse position and a longitudinal

position of a printing master positioned at a standard position thereof
relative to a print sheet and a biased print position indication mark

(316) including at least two straight lines perpendicular to one another
for indicating respectively a transverse position and a longitudinal

position of the printing master biased in either or both of transverse
and longitudinal directions from said standard position, wherein said

biased print position indication mark is biased relative to said standard
position indication mark in the same direction as and in accordance

with a biasing of the print image relative to the print sheet in either
or both of the transverse and longitudinal directions.
A print image position indication device according to claim 1,
wherein said standard print position indication mark (314) and said

biased print position indication mark (316) are each of a rectangular
configuration imitating an outline of the printing master.
A print image position indication device according to claim 1,
wherein said standard print position indication mark (314) and said

biased print position indication mark (316) are each of a configuration
of cross.
A print image position indication device according to claim 1,
wherein said standard print position indication mark (314) and said

biased print position indication mark (316) are each of a configuration
of hook.
A print image position indication device according to any one of
claims 1-4, wherein said biased print position indication mark (316) is 

biased relative to said standard print position indication mark (314) at
a substantially greater rate than a ratio of a biasing amount of the

printing master from said standard position thereof to the size of the
printing master.
A print image position indication device according to any one of
claims 1-5, wherein a biasing amount of the printing master from the

standard position thereof is digitally indicated for a biasing of said
biased print position indication mark (316) from said standard print

position indication mark (314).
A print image position indication device according to any one of
claims 1-6, wherein said standard print position indication mark (314)

and said biased print position indication mark (316) are expressed by
lines of different kinds from one another for clearly contrasting one

against the other.
A print image position indication device according to claim 2,
wherein rectangular areas confined respectively by said standard print

position indication mark (314) and said biased print position indication
mark (316) are coloured to provide a clear colour contrast against one

another such that, when said biased print image indication mark is
biased relative to said standard print position indication mark, an area

located inside said standard print position indication mark but outside
said biased print position indication mark, an area located inside said

biased print position indication mark but outside said standard print
position indication mark, and an area located inside said standard print

position indication mark and also inside said biased print position
indication mark present respective colours different from one another.
A print image position indication device according to claim 2,
wherein rectangular areas confined respectively by said standard print

position indication mark (314) and said biased print position indication
mark (316) are given with patterns different from one another making

a clear contrast against one another such that, when said biased print
position indication mark is biased relative to said standard print

position indication mark, an area located inside said standard print 
position indication mark but outside said biased print position indication

mark, an area located inside said biased print position indication mark
but outside said standard print position indication mark, and an area

located inside said standard print position indication mark and also
inside said biased print position indication mark present respective

patterns different from one another.
