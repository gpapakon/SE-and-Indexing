<ABSTRACT>
A reel-to-reel tape cartridge 10 includes two tape 
guides 45, 100, 100' for guiding the tape 12 to and 

from respective tape reels 14, 16. The tape guides 
45, 100, 100' have a large radius of curvature and are 

flanged to form a long trough 98 to guide and align 
the tape to improve tape tracking. The tape guides 

45, 100, 100' are formed of two flange pieces 50, 52, 
102, 104, 102', 104' separated by a tape surface piece 

54, 106 and a post 56, 108, 108'. Each flange piece 
50, 52, 102, 104, 102', 104' is generally semi-circular 

and includes three notches 68, 70, 72 which 
receive tabs 82, 84, 86, 122, 123, 124 on the tape 

surface piece to secure the tape surface piece. The 
tape surface piece is formed as a type of leaf spring 

that is loaded when it is assembled between the flange 
pieces. The post can be cylindrical or flat.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to tape 
guides for guiding the tape in a reel-to-reel data 
tape cartridge. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to tape guides which improve tape 
tracking and reduce the required drive force. The belt-driven data tape cartridge of von 
Behren, U.S. Patent No. 3,692,255 has become a 
standard interface with computers where rapid 
acceleration and deceleration of the tape are 
required. In these reel-to-reel tape cartridges, an 
elastic driving belt extends along a belt path around 
corner guide rollers positioned adjacent the tape 
reels, contacts the tape on the reels, and drives the 
tape from reel to reel. A tape path extends between 
the reels and along one edge of the cartridge across a 
cutaway portion providing access to the tape by a 
transducer such as a magnetic read/write head which is 
a part of a tape drive which receives the cartridge. 
The tape path is defined by a guide pin, a pair of 
tape guides, and in some cartridges, a pair of tape 
wrap pins. One tape wrap pin is positioned between 
each reel and the adjacent tape guide to deflect the 
tape from a straight line path between the tape supply 
on the reel and the tape guide. This increases the 
frictional coupling between the tape and the tape wrap 
pin as the amount of tape wound on the reel increases 
and helps to maintain constant tape tension at the 
magnetic head.  
 Belt driven tape cartridges must meet 
minimum tape tension specifications while 
simultaneously maintaining minimum drive force 
specifications. The tape tension must not fall below 
a certain level as the tape passes from reel to reel 
or contact between the read/write head and the tape 
will be insufficient. The minimum achievable tape 
tension should be sufficiently high to ensure proper 
cartridge operation. Similarly, the maximum required 
frictional drive force should be as low as possible to 
enhance cartridge operation within the power 
limitations of the drive motor. Thus, there is a 
limitation on the frictional drive force. The 
frictional drive force is that portion of the drive 
force which affects power loss at the interface 
between the tape backside and the tape guide. There 
is a continuing need to further minimize the 
frictional drive force and to improve tape tracking 
thereby to further enhance cartridge operation. This 
can be accomplished by minimizing the friction at the 
interface between the tape and the tape guides, which 
accounts for approximately one-third of the drive 
force in a data
