<ABSTRACT>
Catalyst compositions comprising metallocene complexes having 
polymerisable groups may be used for the preparation of polyolefins. 
The catalyst compositions may be in the form of polymers 
comprising the metallocene complex and may be suitably supported on 

inorganic supports. Polymers having a broad range of density and 
melt indices as well as low hexane extractables and excellent powder 

morphology and flowability may be obtained by use of the catalyst 
compositions. Preferred metallocene complexes are zirconium complexes 

in which the polymerisable group is vinyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel catalyst compositions 
comprising metallocene complexes and their use in the polymerisation 
of olefins. Metallocene complexes of Group IVA metals such as 
(cyclopentadienyl)₂ZrCl₂ are known as homogeneous polyolefin 
catalysts in the presence of a suitable co-catalyst. Such catalyst 
systems have proven to be highly active towards ethylene and alpha 
olefins forming narrow molecular weight distributions of polyolefins. It would be highly desirable to provide catalysts which may be 
used, particularly in the gas phase, to prepare polymers which show 
good performance and processability. We have now discovered that catalyst compositions comprising 
metallocene complexes having a polymerisable group may advantageously 
be used in the polymerisation of olefins. Accordingly, the present invention provides a catalyst 
composition comprising at least one metallocene complex of general 
formula I or II

M[XRn]x Yp   (I) 
wherein R is a univalent or divalent 1-20C hydrocarbyl, or a 1-20C 
hydrocarbyl containing substituent oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, 
nitrogen or boron atoms with the proviso that at least one R group  
 
contains a polymerisable group and preferably contains at least three 
carbon atoms, and when there are two R groups present they may be the 
same or different, and when R is divalent it is directly attached to 
M, and replaces a Y ligand, wherein
 
   X is an organic group containing a cyclopentadienyl nucleus,
 
   M is a Group IVA metal,
 
   Y is a univalent anionic ligand, and
 
for formula I,
 
   n is an integer of 1 to 10
 
   x is either 1 or 2, and
 
   when x = 1, p = 0 - 3, that is, when all R are univalent, p = 
3; when one R is divalent, p = 2, when two Rs are divalent, p = 1 and 
when three Rs are divalent, p = 0,
 
   when x = 2, p = 0-2, that is, when all R are univalent, p = 2; 
when one R is divalent, p = 1 and when two Rs are divalent, p = 0, 
and for formula II,
 
   n, m and l are integers or 0 such that 
n + m + l ≧ 1  
, p = 0-2, 
that is, when all R are univalent, p = 2; when one R is divalent, p = 
1 and when two Rs are divalent, p = 0, and
 
   Z is a C₁ to C₄ alkylene radical or a dialkyl germanium or 
silicon or an alkyl phosphine or amine radical or bis-dialkylsilyl or 
bis-dialkylgermanyl containing hydrocarbyl groups having 1 to 4 
carbon atoms bridging the cyclopentadienyl nuclei. The metallocene complex of the present invention is a Group IVA 
metallocene complex of general formula I or II wherein M is suitably 
hafnium,
