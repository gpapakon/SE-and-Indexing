<ABSTRACT>
A surveillance information recording system comprises a 
recording device loaded with a recording medium for 

recording video information concerning the object or place 
to be monitored, and a dummy device which can eject a 

recording medium in a manner similar to that in which a 
recording medium is ejected from an ordinary recording 

device. The recording device is located in an inconspicuous 
place, or concealed. The dummy device is located in a 

relatively conspicuous place. An intruder will mistakenly 
believe that if he carries out an ejecting operation on the 

dummy device and takes away the ejected recording medium, no 
evidence against him will be left behind. As an 

alternative, two loading sections may be provided in a 
single recording device, the recording of information being 

carried out in one of the loading sections, and the 
recording medium in the other loading section being ejected 

responsive to an ejecting operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
recording system for the purpose of surveillance in the
field of security, and particularly to a countermeasure
against burglary of recording media on which information has
been recorded.A surveillance information recording device, e.g., a
VTR (video tape recorder) provided for security, records
information from one or more TV cameras that pick up images
of places requiring surveillance. The recorded information,
e.g., image information, is utilized for identifying the
intruder in the event of a burglary or the like.However, in such a surveillance information recording
device, it may happen that the intruder may remove the
recording medium, e.g. a magnetic tape, on which information
against him has been recorded before making his escape. If
the recording medium is removed, the necessary information
is not left. and the intended function of the recording
device is not accomplished. US-A-4,651,144 describes a security housing having
the appearance of a housing containing a surveillance
camera, the housing including a dummy camera and a
motion detector. The appearance of the housing is
changed when motion is detected to give the impression
that the apparatus is in fact a surveillance
camera. The dome that normally conceals the camera is
lighted, and this light is extinguished when motion
is detected. A spot light or flood light lights the
area in response to detectin of motion, and an audible
alarm may be sounded.The present invention has been made to solve the
above described problem relating to a surveillance
information recording device and its object is to
prevent removal or taking-away of the recording media
in the recording device.This object according to the invention is solved
for a method of recording surveillance information by
means of the features of the characterizing part of
claim 1 and for a surveillance information recording
system by means of the features of the characterizing
part of claim 2. Preferred embodiments of the system
are defined in the subclaims. A surveillance information recording system
according to the present invention is provided with a
recording device capable of recording on a recording
medium and is characterized by a dummy device which
has a loading section which can load an recording
medium, and includes ejection means for ejection of a
recording medium from said loading section in a manner
similar to that in which ejection is effected in
an ordinary recording device.If a dummy device is set up as described above, the
