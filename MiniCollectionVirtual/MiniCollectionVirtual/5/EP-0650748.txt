<ABSTRACT>
The distributor (2) comprises a pattern of spraying points at an advantageously substantially constant surface-area pitch (6, 6') on the majority of the spraying surface, the pattern being typically uniform in a main zone of the distributor and irregular, with associated surface-area zones which are also irregular (6', 6'') in a connecting zone, the spraying points delivering predetermined flow rates defined by calibrated orifices (4, 4', 4'') which have sections chosen from a predetermined group of n sections, n not exceeding four and advantageously not exceeding two. Application especially to packed air distillation columns.

<CLAIMS>
Liquid-distributor for a heat and matter-exchanging 
device (3) having an upper interface constituting a 

sprinkling area comprising gas passages (5; 50) and a 
plurality of liquid passages (4, 4', 4''), the liquid 

passages being defined by calibrated orifices (4, 4', 4'') 
distributed in accordance with a pattern of spraying points 

which is at least partly irregular, the orifices (4, 4', 

4'') having a section which is selected from a group of 
n
 
different predetermined sections, where 
n
 does not exceed 
4, characterised in that each orifice is disposed in the 

centre of gravity of an individual surface (6, 6', 6'') 
having an area corresponding to the section of the 

associated orifice. 
Distributor according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the ratio between the maximum section and the minimum 

section of the group of 
n
 sections is lower than 100. 
Distributor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that 
n
 does not exceed 2. 
Distributor according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the orifices (4, 4') have a substantially constant section 

(
n
 = 1). 
Distributor according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it comprises a plane structure (2) in 

which the orifices (4, 4') are formed in accordance with 
the said pattern. 
Distributor according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it comprises a series of 

intercommunicating (21) parallel chutes (20) in which 
orifices (4,) with a single diameter are formed in 

accordance with the said pattern.  
 
Distributor according to claim 6, characterised in that 
at least some of the chutes (20) have an end (200) 

extending as far as the immediate vicinity of a peripheral 
sleeve (1) enclosing the distributor and the exchanging 

device (3). 
Distributor according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in 
that it comprises at least one discharge passage (41) 

extending between an orifice (40) formed in a chute (20), 
and a sprinkling point (4') offset from the chute. 
Distributor according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that it comprises, in a central part, a 

regular pattern of sprinkling points (4). 
Distributor according to one of claims 7 and 8, 
characterised in that it comprises, in lateral zones 

adjoining the ends (200) of the chutes (20), a regular 
pattern of sprinkling points (4). 
Distillation column comprising at least one distributor 
according to one of the preceding claims, which distributor 

is associated with a heat and matter-exchanging device (3) 
of the type having packing. 
Column according to claim 11, characterised in that the 
heat and matter-exchanging device (3) is of the type having 

structured packing. 
Use of a column according to one of claims 11 and 12 
for the distillation of air.
