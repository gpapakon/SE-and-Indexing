<ABSTRACT>
The unit is formed by working heads (2) of all blank keys 
of different types of cars so as to confer all heads the 

same shape and size in order to lodge all the heads (2) 
worked in this way and the remote control circuit (10) 

within a case (3, 30) that is always the same.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a unit with an alarm remote 
control and starter key for automobiles. In the field of electronic alarm or anti-theft devices for 
cars first one moved from a separate remote control to a 
key-ring remote control, and from the latter to a remote 
control incorporated into a case that contains both the 
alarm remote control's electronic circuit and the head of 
the key, all thanks to the increasingly small dimensions of 
said circuit afforded by progress in electronics. 
The following description will identify: 
"alarm" as an electronic alarm and/or anti-theft device 
for automobiles; "key, as a key with which to open doors and start the car 
engine; "key-head" as a grip consisting of a case containing said 
electronic circuit, the head of the key associated to the 
same case and the blade thereof extends out of the case and 
at least one button to activate said electronic circuit 
(obviously, then, the grip is none other than unit subject 
of the present invention). The convenience for a driver of possessing a single object 
with which to control doors, start-up and for controlling 
one's car alarm, is evident. But, if one considers that 
each automobile manufacturer produces a number of types of 
chain-assembled cars (apart from custom-built ones) and  
 
that for each of these types at least one corresponding key 
is produced, one may understand how costly it would be for 
an alarm manufacturer to produce and manage such a large 
number of remote control-key units required to satisfy so 
many different requests. In the best of cases some 
automobile manufacturers produce only one type or a few 
types of keys for their types of cars. But this does not 
greatly change the problem of the current state of affairs 
that is basically solved by producing a large number of 
molds for the two shells of said case. The production of one of said units or grips involves the 
availability and association of the following elements: 
an electronic circuit for said remote control, a blank key; a case in which to enclose said circuit and the head of 
said blank key. By blank key we intend a key in which the blade still has 
no teeth to operate on doors and starter of a car and the 
head shaped so as to fit into one of said cases or to act 
as a grip itself. Therefore a producer of alarms who intends placing a key-head 
on the market for a given car, must design the molds 
for the two shells of the case that must be suited to the 
head of a given key and the electronic circuit must be 
suite
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A unit with an alarm remote control and a starter key 
for automobiles comprising a case containing a circuit for 

said remote control, at least one button P and a LED L, 
respectively to activate said circuit and show that the 

battery for said circuit is charged or not, and 
incorporating the head of said key characterized in that it 

is obtained by: 

1) procuring a desired quantity of each type of blank keys 
(1) suited to various types of cars chosen; 
2) working heads (2) of each blank key procured in stage 1) 
to form all heads (2) in identical shape and size, said 

shape and size being at least sufficient to provide the 
required resistance to torsion applied in operations; 
3) obtain a series of two shells (3, 30) to form a quantity 
of said cases in each of which a space in which to fit and 

hold said worked head (2) and a space to receive the remote 
control circuit (10) are defined, said series being a 

series of two shells always the same. 
4) enclose, between pairs of corresponding shells (3, 30) 
said remote control circuit (10) and a worked key head (2) 

in order to obtain the desired quantity of said units for 
each type of car. 
Unit according to Claim 1 characterized in that each of 
the worked heads (2) has a width of about 20 mm., a height 

 
of about 7 mm. and thickness about 2 mm. 
Unit according to Claim 1 characterized in that in stage 
3) a series of said two shells (3, 30) are formed different 

in shape and size. 
Unit according to Claim 1 characterized in that one or 
both of said shells (3, 30) comprise means (7) for 

fastening said head (2). 
Unit according to Claim 1 characterized in that said 
stage 2) comprises operations for working each head of the 

blank keys so as to reduce them to an extension (12) about 
2 mm. thick and co-molding said extension with plastic 

(13) in order to form a head having a width and thickness 
suited at least to conferring the co-molded head with the 

required resistance to torsion during operations and to 
lodging said co-molded head in said case (3, 30). 
Unit according to Claim 5 characterized in that said 
extension (12) has width equal to blade (11) of a special 

key and the plastic part co-molded has width (L) about 20 
mm. and thickness (S) about 3.5 mm.
