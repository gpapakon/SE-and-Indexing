<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a voltage-controlled bidirectional monolithic power switch having two main terminals (A1, A2), and controlled by a control electrode (g) the voltage of which is referenced with respect to one (A1) of the main terminals. This switch comprises a P-channel lateral MOS transistor (2, 8, 3), a vertical N-channel MOS transistor (3-4, 5, 6-1), the source well (3) of the vertical N-channel MOS transistor thus constituting the source of the lateral transistor; a lateral thyristor (3, 8, 2, 24) the first three regions of which correspond to the source, to the drain and to the channel of the lateral MOS transistor; a first vertical thyristor (3, 1, 20, 22) in parallel with the lateral thyristor; and a second vertical thyristor (21, 3, 1, 20) of polarity opposite the first one and in parallel with the vertical MOS transistor.
