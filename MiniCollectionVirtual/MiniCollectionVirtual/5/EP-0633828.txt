<ABSTRACT>
A nozzle for a sand blaster for dust-free blasting of plain surfaces comprises a tubular housing (1) with a revolving nozzle head (3) which is connectable to a blast hose (2). The nozzle head (3) is covered whith an end plate (4) provided with inclined orifices (7) so that the nozzle head (3) will be revolved by the throw of the sand blasting material. For a better adapatability to different demands for cleaning, each orifice (7) is provided with a slewable blast pipe (9) which is mounted slewable with a socket joint (10) at the end plate (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a nozzle of a sand blaster for 
dust-free blasting of plain surfaces comprising a tubular 
housing connectable to a blast hose and provided with a revolving 
nozzle head diffuserlike enlarged and covered with 
an end plate which is provided with inclined orifices, so 
that the nozzle head is revolved by the throw of the sand 
blasting material. For dust-free sand blasting of plain surfaces, sand blasters 
are known which are provided with a hood mounted on 
the nozzle head for covering the blasted area and comprising 
installations for sucking off the blasting material 
and the dust. The nozzle head is provided with a venturi 
nozzle which directs the sand blasting material resp. abrasive 
in a conical shape against the surface to be blasted. 
The nozzle head is moved over the surface strip by strip. 
For a revolving drive of the nozzle head, but avoiding an 
additional motor, a blast nozzle is known from DE 38 34 896 
C2, the end plate of it is provided with inclined orifices 
so that the diffuserlike enlarged nozzle head is revolved 
by the throw of the abrasive-air-mixture. For adjustment to 
more or less wide blasting strips and /or blasting effects 
on the surface to be blasted, the disadvantage is that several 
end plates of different design provided with appropriate 
orifices must be available and storaged. Furthermore 
WO 92/17318 describes a fluid jet cleaner consisting of a 
nozzle body and a plurality of adjustable nozzles. In one 
configuration the nozzle body is rotable about its axis. 
The adjustment means comprises radially disposed 
longitudinally extensible rod members. By this arrangement 
the nozzles are slewable in a radial direction to control 
the cleaning intensity. In no adjustment of the nozzles the 
nozzle body may be rotated about its axis by the throw of 
the fluid jet but the rotation must be induced by a motor  
 
drive. An antiplash nozzle which is designed to control the 
application of a cooling and lubricating media used in 
cooperation with grinding and cutting tools is mentioned in 
US 2557 106. The nozzle produces a central fluid flow and a 
fluid curtain flow surrounding the central flow. For this 
the nozzle comprises a spherical nozzle stem mounting 
member, universally adjustable in a socket portion and 
producing the central fluid flow, whereas the fluid curtain 
flow is produced by an annular by-pass between the socket 
portion and an exterior sleeve. But this nozzle is not 
suitable for a sand blaster and for producing a rotation of 
th
