<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a video server 
memory management for a video server transmitting video 

signals (VS) to user stations in response to control signals 
issued by these stations. 
This method includes the steps of providing a 
memory constituted by a plurality of random access memories 

(HD1/../HD4) and subdividing each of said video signals in a 
plurality of distinct blocks (BL1/../BLQ) each typically 

corresponding to less than a second of the video signal. It 

is further proposed to include in this method the step of 
storing any two blocks (BL1/../BLQ) which normally are to be 

consecutively retrieved from the memory in distinct random 
access memories (HD1/../HD4). 
In this way the full interactive video on demand 
service, giving the user stations control over the way in 

which the blocks are retrieved from the memory, is improved 
as is the rate at which a predetermined sequence of blocks is 

retrieved from the memory.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video server memory
management method including the steps of providing a memory
constituted by a plurality of random access memories each having
a single output for retrieving data stored therein, subdividing
each of said video signals in a plurality of distinct blocks
corresponding to successive parts of said video signal, storing
at least two of said blocks in each of said random access
memories, and, retrieving said blocks from said random access
memories in a predetermined sequence, and two consecutive blocks
of said predetermined sequence being stored in distinct ones of
said random access memories, said plurality of random access
memories being constituted by an even number of disk shaped
memories each having a plurality of cylinders constituting
equally large first and second subsets of memories, said method
further including the step of storing consecutive odd numbered
blocks and consecutive even numbered blocks of said sequence in
successive cylinders of said first and of said second subset
respectively.A similar memory management method is already known from the
PCT application WO-A-90/07184.This known method has the drawback that the rate at which
data can be retrieved is restricted. In using hard disks or other
disk shaped memories and applying the method described in the
above PCT application this rate is equal to the average transfer
rate at which data may be retrieved from the "memory banks" on
the disks.An object of the present invention consists in providing a
memory management method of the above known type but allowing the
above predetermined sequence to be retrieved at a rate exceeding
the above mentioned average transfer rate thereby improving the
number of blocks that can be retrieved and hence also the
"granularity" with which the video signal can be provided to the
user stations in using a predetermined number of hard disks. This object is achieved thanks to a feature of the present
method which consists in that said storing of said consecutive
odd numbered blocks and said consecutive even numbered blocks of
said sequence in successive cylinders of said first and of said
second subset respectively is done in first and second directions
respectively which are mutually opposite.In this way, and taking for instance a plurality of two disk
shaped memories, the rate at which the predetermined sequence can
be generated substantially equals the average of the maximum
sustainable transfer rate corresponding to the inner cylinder of
the disk shaped

sequence of M consecutively numbered random access memories and
said plurality of blocks comprises a sequence of Q consecutively

numbered blocks and that each of said blocks with sequence number
Y is stored in the random access memory with sequence number

equal to Y mod M.

plurality of random access memories (HD1/../HD4) are controlled
from a same memory controller (SCSIC) via a bus (SCSI).
Video server memory management method according claim 2,
characterized in that said method further includes the step of

providing within said video signal (VS) a spread mode indicator
indicating the number M of said plurality of memories

(HD1/../HD4).
