<ABSTRACT>
The adhesion of epoxy-resin containing resist compositions to a copper 
sur-face, which resist compositions are exposed to actinic radiation, 

developed and hardened, is enhanced by contacting the copper surface 
with an N-heterocyclic compound comprising -NH₂ groups and drying the 

copper surface comprising the N-heterocyclic compound prior to 
application of the resist. Printed wiring boards produced by a 

partially additive process can be produced using this adhesion 
enhan-cement technique.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to adhesion promoting compositions on surfaces 
of copper and methods for producing thermal stress resistant copper 
conductors for printed circuit boards. In particular, this invention 
relates to the field of printed wiring boards produced by a partially 
additive process. Printed circuit boards can fail by breaks in the copper conductive 
pattern caused by the stresses induced by the difference between the 
thermal expansion of the copper conductive pattern and the insulating 
substratum to which it is attached. Thermal stresses occur when 
components are joined to the conductive pattern by soldering at 
temperatures from 200° to 300°C. The printed circuit industry has 
recognized this problem by imposing thermal stress test and tensile 
requirements on printed circuit boards. MIL-P-55110 D specifications require the printed circuit boards to be 
thermally stressed by application of molten solder at 288°C for ten 
seconds. After soldering, holes in the test board are microsectioned 
and examined with a 100x microscope. The resistance to thermal stress 
is evaluated by assigning a crack rating on a scale of 0 to 160 with 
ratings above 15 being considered a failure of the test. Since there 
may be more than one soldering cycle in the assembly of a printed 
circuit, some electronic equipment manufacturers have required 
suppliers of printed wiring boards to test the boards by four 
repetitive thermal stress cycles at 288 °C.  IPC TECHNICAL REPORT, IPC-TR-579, ROUND ROBIN RELIABILITY EVALUATION 
OF SMALL DIAMETER PLATED THROUGH HOLES IN PRINTED WIRING BOARDS, 
Lincolnwood, IL: Institute for Interconnecting and Packaging 
Electronic Circuits, 1988, p. 25, describes thermal cycling between 
25°C and 260°C in a Fluid Sand T-Shock test. The boards are cycled to 
failure, which is an open circuit or a 10% increase in the resistance 
of a chain of plated-through holes. Five cycles without failure is 
considered acceptable. Printed circuit boards comprise epoxy resin dielectrics adjacent to 
copper surfaces for various functions. Joining layers between inner 
layer conductors of multi layer printed circuit boards comprise epoxy 
resin containing polymers. Epoxy resin dielectrics are often used as 
solder resists and as plating resists for defining conductor patterns. 
In the manufacture of printed circuit boards by a partially additive 
process the resists are required to firmly adhere to copper surfaces 
even after several hours of plating in an electroless copper solution 
at elevated
