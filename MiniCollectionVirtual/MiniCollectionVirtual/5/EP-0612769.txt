<ABSTRACT>
An ethylene/α-olefin copolymer of a weight-average 
molecular weight of not less than 40000 is 

produced by copolymerization of ethylene with an α-olefin 
having three or more carbons by use of an olefin 

polymerization catalyst at a polymerization temperature of 
not lower than 120°C, the olefin polymerization catalyst 

comprising, as constitutional components, a) a metallocene 
compound, b) an ionizing ionic compound, and c) an 

organoaluminum compound, the ionizing ionic compound (b) 
being a compound which is capable of changing the 

metallocene compound (a) into a cationic form and does not 
further react with the cationic form of the metallocene 

compound. This process produces an ethylene/α-olefin 
copolymer of high molecular weight in high efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer of a high-molecular 
weight with an olefin polymerization catalyst 
constituted of a metallocene compound, an organoaluminum 
compound, and an ionizable ionic compound. The low-pressure Ziegler process for 
polymerization of ethylene or an α-olefin is well known in 
the related technical fields. The catalyst for the 
process is generally prepared by treating a mixture of an 
organometallic compound or hydride of a metal of Group 1A 
to 3A of the Periodic Table with a compound of a transition 
metal (Group 3B or 2B of the Periodic Table) in a suspension 
or a solution, or in the absence of a solvent or a 
diluent. In recent years, other special kinds of 
catalysts are being developed which are active in olefin 
polymerization. Examples of the catalysts are combinations 
of a cyclopentadienyl derivative of a metal such as 
titanium, zirconium, and hafnium (Group 4B of Periodic 
Table) with aluminoxane. (See, for example, J. Boor: 
"Ziegler-Natta Catalyst and Polymerization", Academic 
Press, New York (1979), and H. Sinn and W. Kaminsky: Adv. 
Organomet. Chem. 1899 (1980)). These catalysts have an 
ability of forming a stereospecific olefin polymer with  
 
high catalyst activity. JP-A-1-503788 describes a high-pressure high-temperature 
process for producing ethylene/α-olefin 
copolymer by use of a transition metal compound and an 
aluminoxane as the catalyst. Nevertheless, such catalysts have not been used 
industrially mainly because of the following reasons: the 
aluminoxane cannot readily be produced in a reproducible 
form, hindering preparation of the catalyst and the 
polymer with required reproducibility, and the expensive 
aluminoxane has to be used in a considerably high ratio to 
the transition metal compound to achieve sufficient 
activity. To offset the above disadvantages, 
JP-A-3-207704 discloses an ionic metallocene 
compound prepared by reacting a metallocene with an 
ionizing ionic compound. PCT Application No. WO 92-1723 
discloses a process of α-olefin polymerization by use of a 
catalyst system prepared by reacting a halogenated 
metallocene with an organometallic compound and then 
bringing the reaction product into contact with an 
ionizing ionic compound. This catalyst system is 
advantageous in olefin polymerization. However, when 
ethylene and α-olefin are copolymerized by use of such a 
catalyst system at a high temperature, the resulting 
copolymer disadvantageously has a low molecular
