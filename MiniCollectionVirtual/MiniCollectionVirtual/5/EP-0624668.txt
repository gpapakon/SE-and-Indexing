<ABSTRACT>
In order to bond a so-called "tarpaulin" 
sheet obtained by coating a synthetic resin 

to a fiber base fabric, bonded by sewing 
means to woven fabrics such as a tape or a 

belt, the present invention aims at providing a 
woven fabric having a structure suitable for 

bonding. Further, the present invention provides 
a woven fabric having a constituent portion 

suitable for bonding with a fabric of the 
same kind. A woven fabric (100) is divided in 

a longitudinal direction or a transverse direction 
or in both directions, and one, or both, of 

warps and wefts are woven more coarsely in 
at least one zone (22, 32) than in the other 

zones to be formed into a mesh (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a woven fabric having portions
suitable for bonding so that bonding means by sewing
according to the prior art can be changed to means for
bonding by a synthetic resin film or adhesive, when a
sheet and a woven fabric, which are coated with a
synthetic resin film or adhesive on the surface thereof,
or the woven fabrics, are bonded to each other and are
used. Moreover, this invention relates to a method for
constructing such a structure.When a tent, a flexible container, a material for civil
engineering, etc., are produced, a so-called "tarpaulin
sheet", which is produced by coating a synthetic resin
on a fiber base fabric by a calendering process, etc.,
has been used widely. In most cases, a tape, a belt,
etc., are joined by sewing so as to reinforce or bond the
sheets or to bond them to other members. When a tent
sheet is fixed to skeletal pipes of the tent when
pitching the tent, for example, Japanese Utility Model
Application No. 61-090926 provides a woven fabric for
fitting the tent sheet. In this case, the center portion
of the woven fabric for fitting the sheet in its
transverse direction is bonded by sewing to the tarpaulin
sheet of a tent base, both ends of the woven fabric for
fitting the sheet in the transverse direction are wound 
on a pipe, and both terminals are then bound and fixed by
a type or a rope. In the case of the tarpaulin sheets,
they can be easily bonded by radio frequency welding or
thermal welding. However, if the tarpaulin sheet is used
alone, the strenght is not sufficient. Therefore, there
is the problem that a rope must be sewn into a terminal
of the sheet. The pior art reference described above
proposes a woven fabric for fitting the sheet which
solves this problem. However, it takes much labor to sew
the woven fabric for fitting the sheet to the tent sheet
and moreover, bonding work of sheet pieces for preventing
water leakage from the sewn portions is necessary.
Accordingly, utilization of bonding means of the woven
fabric for fitting the sheet by radio frequency welding
or thermal welding without relying on sewing has been
desired. Further, if the woven fabrics can be bonded to
each other by bonding means without using sewing so that
the tarpaulin sheets can be bonded easily and mutually,
the range of application will become broader. However,
bonding means providing a peel strength which can
withstand practical applidation has not yet been
developed at all to this date.DE-A-3 609 845 discloses a weaving method and a woven

<CLAIMS>
A woven fabric/synthetic resin film or adhesive
combined structure characterized by the following

features:

a woven fabric having warps and wefts and having at least
one zone that extends partially in one of (a) a

longitudinal direction, (b) a transverse direction, and
(c) both the longitudinal direction and the transverse

direction,
at least one of the warps and wefts being more openly
woven in said at least one zone than the rest to form a

mesh portion (2, 9, 22, 32, 42); and
a synthetic resin film or adhesive applied to at least
one surface of said mesh portion (2, 9, 22, 32, 42) such

that material of the synthetic resin film or adhesive
fills voids (13) of the mesh portion (2, 9, 22, 32, 42),

thereby firmly bonding the synthetic resin film or
adhesive to the woven fabric.
A combined structure according to claim 1, wherein a
sum of synthetic resin or adhesive filled void areas in

said mesh portion (2, 9, 22, 32, 42) is from 3 to 30 % of
the total surface area of said mesh portion (2, 9, 22,

32, 42).
A woven fabric/synthetic resin film or adhesive
combined structure characterized by the following

features:

a woven fabric having warps and wefts and having at least
one zone that extends partially in one of (a) a

longitudinal direction, (b) a transverse direction, and 
(c) both the longitudinal direction and the transverse

direction,
a plurality of small openings (50) in said at least one
zone formed by means such as melting, punching, or

differently weaving, to provide a mesh portion (2, 9, 22,
32, 42),
the sum of areas of said small openings (50) being from 3
to 30 % of a total surface area of said mesh portion (2,

9, 22, 32, 42); and
a synthetic resin film or adhesive applied to at least
one surface of said mesh portion (2, 9, 22, 32, 42) so

that material of the synthetic resin film or adhesive
fills said small openings (50) in the mesh portion (2, 9,

22, 32, 42), thereby firmly bonding the synthetic resin
film or adhesive to the woven fabric.
A combined structure according to any of the
preceeding claims, wherein a full width is not greater

than 600 mm.
A combined structure according to claim 1, wherein
said synthetic resin film or adhesive is made of a

portion (2, 9, 22, 32, 42), another plurality of holes
adapted for receiving at least one of a tape and a rope.
A method for constructing a woven fabric/synthetic
resin film or adhesive combined structure, characterized
