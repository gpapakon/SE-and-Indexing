<ABSTRACT>
A workpart transfer assembly (10) 
shuttles workpart stampings from a forming die (14, 

16) of one stamping press (12) to a remotely spaced 
successive forming die (14, 16) in another stamping 

press (12) while the two stamping presses (12) 
cycle in unison. The assembly (10) includes a base 

(18) stationed in a clearance between the two 
stamping presses (12). A dual drive and dual rail 

transfer shuttle (26) slides on the base (18) 
between two oppositely extending cantilever 

positions. A carriage (44) slides along the 
transfer shuttle (26). A dual screw drive 

mechanism drives the transfer shuttle (26) on the 
base (18) while at the same time driving the 

carriage (44) along the transfer shuttle (26), 
thereby effecting highly accelerated movement of 

the carriage. A lift screw mechanism is carried on 
the carriage (44) for raising and lowering a slide 

plate (60) during the shuttling operation. The 
slide plate (60), in turn, supports a pair of 

oppositely extending cantilevered arms (50) having 
suction cup ends (52) for grasping and releasing 

workparts to and from the forming dies (14, 16) and 
a central workpart rest platform (54).

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to a 
workpart transfer assembly for transferring 
workpart stampings from the forming die from one 
stamping press to a remotely spaced successive 
forming die in another stamping press while the two 
stamping presses cycle in unison. In the sheet metal forming industry, 
stamping presses having forming dies are typically 
used to quickly and precisely shape sheet metal 
workpart to the desired form. Automotive body 
parts such as deck lids, doors and quarter panels 
are usually formed in a stamping process. In many 
instances, it is not always prudent to shape the 
final workpart form in one stamping operation. 
Because of the physical properties of sheet metal 
and forming die construction practices, it is 
favored in many instances to form a workpart 
stamping in two or more successive forming 
operations. For large stampings, such as those 
automotive body pieces described above, separate 
and remotely spaced stamping presses must to 
employed in this successive forming operation. In the early days of industry, such 
successively formed workpart stampings were 
manually transferred from the forming die of one  
 
stamping press to a remotely spaced successive 
forming die in another stamping press. Concerns 
for increased productivity and worker safety 
gradually introduced an automated shuttling process 
whereby the two stamping presses were synchronized 
to cycle in unison, with a mechanized workpart 
transfer assembly automatically plucking the 
workpart stamping from the forming die of a first 
stamping press and transferring that stamping to 
the remotely spaced forming die in a second or 
successive stamping press. Examples of these prior art workpart 
transfer assemblies may be found in United States 
patent number 4,509,638 to Kato et al, issued April 
9, 1985 and United States patent number 4,523,889 
to Orii, issued June 18, 1985. These workpart 
transfer assemblies both include a stationary base 
positioned in a clearance space between the two 
stamping presses, and having some form of gripping 
members which reach into the respective stamping 
presses and alternately pluck a partially formed 
workpart stamping from one press and transfer it to 
the next successive forming die in the other 
stamping press. The primary deficiency of these 
workpart transfer assemblies reside in the 
relatively slow rate at which they operate. Slow 
operating rates require slowing of the stamping 
press cycle times, which in turn results in fewer 
workparts produced per hour.
