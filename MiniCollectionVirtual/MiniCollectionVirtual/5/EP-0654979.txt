<ABSTRACT>
A surgical implant for spinal fixation formed by a rigid bent titanium frame (1) having wire receiving means. Spinal fixation implants are used to correct abnormal curvature of, and/or impart stability to, the spine by immobilizing a plurality of vertebrae with respect to each other. A rigid bullet shaped frame which fits neatly onto the posterior surface of the spine to embrace at least two bones is fixed in place by means of fixation wires passed around or looped through the frame and passing through holes in the bones to immobilise the embraced bones with respect to each other. The frame has a substantially rectangular cross section. An improved surgical implant results from the provision of wire receiving means (7, 8, 9) which prevent the fixation wires moving relative to the frame and the bullet shaped frame of rectangular cross section which improves the stability of a fixed implant by close conformity of the implant to the shape of the spine.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical implants for spinal
fixation.Spinal fixation implants are used to correct abnormal
curvature of, and/or impart stability to, the spine by
immobilising a plurality of vertebrae with respect to each
other. A rigid frame which fits neatly onto the posterior
surface of the spine to embrace at least two adjacent
vertebrae is fixed in place by means of fixation wires (or
cables) passed around or looped through the frame and passed
under the laminae to immobilise the embraced vertebrae with
respect to each other.One type of know spinal fixation implant comprises
stainless steel or titanium rods formed into a rectangle.
The fixation wires are looped around the rod formed into a
rectangle. The fixation wires are looped around the rod to
secure the rectangle to the spine.EP-A-146397 discloses a surgical implant for spinal
fixation comprising a rigid biocompatible frame defining an
aperture, the frame consisting of first and second
substantially parallel frame portions connected by bent third
and fourth frame portions, the third and fourth frame
portions extending in the same direction as each other away
from the plane defined by the first and second frame
portions.A problem with such implants is that any tensile or
compressive forces parallel to the direction of the spine
will cause the implant to slip relative to the fixation wires
as soon as the frictional force between the wire and rod is
overcome. A further problem of prior art implants is the
dead space between a fitted implant and the spine arising
from a lack of conformity between the contours of the
cervical spine and the spinal implant. The present invention provides a surgical implant as
defined in claim 1.In a preferred form, the frame defines a bullet-shaped
aperture, that is, three sides of the frame, when viewed from
above, define a substantially rectangular space which is
extended at one end towards a point defined by either
straight or curving converging frame portions.Preferably the frame is formed from titanium alloy
(Ti-6Al-4V) sheet stock and has flat surfaces.Embodiments of the present invention will now be
described, by way of example, and with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a plan view of a surgical implant embodying
the present invention;Figure 2 is a section along line II-II of Figure 1;Figure 3 is a side view of the implant of Figure 1;Figure 4 is a section along line IV-IV of Figure 1;Figure 5 illustrates one of the slots in the implant of

<CLAIMS>
A surgical implant for spinal fixation
comprising a rigid biocompatible frame (1) defining an

aperture (6), the frame consisting of first and second
substantially parallel frame portions (2, 3) connected by

bent third and fourth frame portions (4, 5), the third and
fourth frame portions extending in the same direction as

each other away from the plane defined by the first and
second frame portions, characterised by the frame having

wire receiving means (7, 8) for receiving wire at at least
one point on the frame and fixed relative thereto, the

wire receiving means being a recess formed in one of the
frame portions.
A surgical implant according to Claim 1,
wherein the frame has at leas
t one recess (8) opening into
the frame aperture (6).
A surgical implant according to Claims 1 or 2,
wherein the frame has at least one recess (7) extending

from the edge of the frame remote from the frame aperture
(6).
A surgical implant according to any of the
preceding claims, wherein the frame portions (2, 3,4, 5)

each have a substantially rectangular cross section.
A surgical implant according to Claim 4,
wherein the edges of the frame portions (2, 3, 4, 5) are

chamfered. 
A surgical implant for spinal fixation
according to any preceding claim, wherein at least one of

the third and fourth frame portions (4, 5) is curved away
from the opposing frame portion so as to define a tapered

portion of relatively small width which, in use, can be
fitted closely about the spine.
A surgical implant according to Claim 6,
wherein the third frame portion (5) is curved and the fourth

frame portion (4) is substantially perpendicular to the
parallel frame portions so as to define a substantially

bullet shaped frame aperture.
A surgical implant according to any of the
preceding claims, wherein the fourth frame portion (4)

forms a shallow curve with the middle section of the
fourth frame portion extending into the frame aperture.
A surgical implant according to any of the
preceding claims, wherein the first and second frame

portions (2, 3) are curved so as to match the curvature of
a portion of the spine.
A surgical implant according to any of the
preceding claims wherein the first and second frame

portions (2, 3) are substantially straight.
A surgical implant according to any of the
preceding claims, wherein the frame (1) is formed from a

titanium alloy.
