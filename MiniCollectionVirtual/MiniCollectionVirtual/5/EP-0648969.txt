<ABSTRACT>
A signalling light, in particular a centre-high (raised) light for a rear lighting unit, for a motor vehicle, comprises a casing (10, 20) holding low-power light sources (30) and arrangements (54, 64) for optical processing of the light. These optical arrangements are provided on two opposite faces of two optical plates (50, 60) peripherally joined with a seal. The plates define between them a closed cavity (80) in which the optical arrangements (54, 64) are protected. According to the invention, the casing includes arrangements (12, 14, 16, 22, 24, 26) for mounting the two connected plates by fitting in front of the sources, and it is made in two parts (10, 20), each including a reinforcement (16, 26) for an associated edge of the optical plates (50, 60). By bringing the two parts together, the plates are held by wedging.

A signal lamp, in particular a high mounted lamp for the rear 
window of a motor vehicle, of the type comprising a casing (10, 

20), a series of low power light sources (30) mounted in the casing 
and arrangements (54, 64) for optical treatment of the light 

emitted by the sources, the optical arrangements being provided on 
two facing surfaces of two substantially parallel optical plates 

(50, 60) connected together in a sealed manner, at least with 
respect to powders, by an optically inert peripheral shoulder 

flange (52) and the said plates defining between them a closed 
cavity (80) in which the optical arrangements (54, 64) are 

protected with respect to the outside, characterized in that: 

the casing comprises arrangements (12, 14, 16, 22, 24, 26) for 
mounting the two connected plates by nested fitting in front of the 

said sources, 
the casing is made in two parts (10, 20) respectively comprising 
recesses (16, 26) for two opposite associated edges of the assembly 

constituted by the two joined optical plates (50, 60), the action 
of bringing together said two parts being sufficient to ensure the 

holding in place of the said assembly by wedging, 
the said recesses (16, 26) are adjacent to an outlet window for 
the light (70) defined by the casing and are delimited at one side 

by a peripheral shoulder flange (12, 22) of the said window, and 
the depth of insertion of the two optical plates in the 
respective recesses is such that the said peripheral shoulder 

flange of the window masks the said optically inert peripheral 
shoulder flange (52) of the said assembly constituted by the two 

optical plates. 
A signal lamp in accordance with claim 1, characterized in 
that the two optical plates are peripherally welded to one another. 
A signal lamp in accordance with claim 2, characterized in 
that the two optical plates are welded ultrasonically or by 

vibrations.  
 
A signal lamp in accordance with claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the said peripheral shoulder flange (52) is provided on one 

of the said optical plates (50) and defines a welding face turned 
towards the periphery of the other optical plate. 
A signal lamp according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
said joining face comprises a V-shaped groove (52a) over its whole 

extent and in that the periphery of the other optical plate 
comprises a complementary rib (62) over its entire periphery. 
A signal lamp according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the light sources (30) are electroluminescent 

diodes. 
A signal lamp according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
electroluminescent diodes (30) are arranged in a single line and 

are soldered to a common printed circuit (40). 
A signal lamp according to any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that an inner optical plate (50) comprises at 

right angles to each source a plurality of devices (54) for 
concentration of luminous flux and in that an outer optical plate 

(60), forming the indicator, comprises at least at right angles to 
each source (30) a plurality of devices (64) for diffusion of 

luminous flux.
