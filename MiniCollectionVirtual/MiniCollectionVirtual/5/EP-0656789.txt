<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for administering to a mammal suffering from, or at risk for, an LFA-1-mediated disorder an initial dosing of a therapeutically effective amount of LFA-1 antagonist, followed by a subsequent intermittent dosing of a therapeutically effective amount of LFA-1 antagonist that is less than 100 %, calculated on a daily basis, of the initial dosing of antagonist.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for 
preparing a medicament for 
treating mammals, 
preferably humans, who suffer from unwanted immune responses. 
In particular, it relates to medicaments for ameliorating LFA-1-mediated 
disorders, such as those caused by transplanted 
grafts and immune diseases. The treatment of disorders and diseases mediated by T 
lymphocytes has been addressed through many routes. 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one such disorder. Current 
therapy for RA includes bed rest, application of heat, and 
drugs. Salicylate is the currently preferred drug, 
particularly as other alternatives such as immunosuppressive 
agents and adrenocorticosteroids can cause greater morbidity 
than the underlying disease itself. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs are available, and many of them have 
effective analgesic, anti-pyretic and anti-inflammatory 
activity in RA patients. These include indomethacin, 
phenylbutazone, phenylacetic acid derivatives such as 
ibuprofen and fenoprofen, naphthalene acetic acids 
(naproxen), pyrrolealkanoic acid (tometin), indoleacetic 
acids (sulindac), halogenated anthranilic acid (meclofenamate 
sodium), piroxicam, and diflunisal. Other drugs for use 
in RA include anti-malarials such as chloroquine, gold salts 
and penicillamine. These alternatives frequently produce 
severe side effects, including retinal lesions and kidney and 
bone marrow toxicity. Immunosuppressive agents such as 
methotrexate have been used only in the treatment of severe 
and unremitting RA because of their toxicity. 
Corticosteroids also are responsible for undesirable side 
effects (e.g., cataracts, osteoporosis, and Cushing's disease 
syndrome) and are not well tolerated in many RA patients. Another disorder mediated by T lymphocytes is rejection 
of host or grafts after transplantation. Attempts to prolong 
the survival of transplanted allografts and xenografts, or to  
 
prevent graft versus host rejection, both in experimental 
models and in medical practice, have centered mainly on the 
suppression of the immune apparatus of the recipient. This 
treatment has as its aim preventive immunosuppression and/or 
treatment of graft rejection. Examples of agents used 
for preventive immunosuppression include cytotoxic drugs, 
anti-metabolites, corticosteroids, and anti-lymphocytic 
serum. Nonspecific immunosuppressive agents found 
particularly effective in preventive immunosuppression 
(azathioprine, bromocryptine, methylprednisolone, prednisone, 
and most recently, cyclosporin A) have

<CLAIMS>
The use of an LFA-1 antagonist in the preparation of a 
medicament for the treatment Of an LFA-1 mediated disorder, which 

treatment comprises administering to a mammal an initial dosing 
of a therapeutically effective amount of the antagonist, followed 

by a subsequent intermittent dosing of a therapeutically 
effective amount of the antagonist that is less than 100%, 

calculated on a daily basis, of the initial dosing of the 
antagonist, wherein the antagonist is administered to the mammal 

not more than once per week during the intermittent dosing. 
The use according to claim 1 wherein the LFA-1 mediated 

disorder is rejection of a transplanted graft, rejection by a 
transplanted graft, multiple sclerosis, or psoriasis. 
The use according to claim 2 wherein the LFA-1 mediated 
disorder is rejection of a transplanted graft or rejection by a 

transplanted graft. 
The use according to claim 3 wherein the initial dosing 
takes place before, during, and after transplantation has 

occurred. 
The use according to claim 3 or claim 4 wherein the initial 
dosing comprises daily administration of the antagonist for at 

least one week after transplantation has occurred and the 
subsequent dosing comprises administration of the antagonist no 

more than once biweekly for at least about 5 weeks after the end 
of the initial dosing. 
The use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the antagonist is an anti-LFA-1 antibody or an anti-ICAM-1 

antibody.

anti-CD18 antibody or an anti-CD11a antibody. 
The use according to claim 7 wherein the antagonist is an 
anti-CD11a antibody. 
The use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the subsequent dosing is less than about 50%, calculated on a 

daily basis, of the initial dosing of the antagonist. 
The use according to claim 9 wherein the subsequent dosing 
is less than about 25%, calculated on a daily basis, of the 

initial dosing of the antagonist. 
The use according to claim 10 wherein the subsequent dosing 
is less than about 10%, calculated on a daily basis, of the 

initial dosing of the antagonist. 
The use according to claim 11 wherein the subsequent dosing 
is less than about 2%, calculated on a daily basis, of the 

initial dosing of the antagonist. 
The use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the initial dosing consists of daily administration. 
The use according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the subsequent dosing is carried out for a longer time than the 

initial dosing. 
The use according to any one of the preceding claims further 
comprising administering an effective amount of an 

immunosuppressive agent to the mammal. 
The use according to claim 15 wherein the immunosuppressive 
agent comprising cyclosporin A.  

 
The use according to any one of the preceding claims
