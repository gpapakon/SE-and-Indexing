<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a process for bonding a vehicle window to a vehicle flange comprising the sequential steps of: a) applying a liquid masking composition to a vehicle flange, b) painting the vehicle, and drying or curing the liquid masking composition sufficiently to form a strippable mask; c) removing the mask from the flange; and d) adhesively bonding the vehicle window to the vehicle flange. Such a masking process advantageously eliminates the need for the use of solvent-based primers normally used to prime a painted vehicle flange, and provides a mask which is more easily applied and removed from the flange than masking means which initially comprise a solid substance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for installing vehicle windows and, more 
specifically, to processes for installing a vehicle window through the use of an adhesive. It is known to mount vehicle windows in a vehicle through the use of an adhesive 
such as, for example, a moisture-curable urethane adhesive. In such a mounting procedure, the 
edge of the window is glued to a flange of a vehicle body opening. This procedure usually 
takes place after the vehicle body, including the flange to which the window is to be adhered 
to, has been coated with several coats of vehicle paint. Since many commercial urethane 
adhesives will not provide sufficient adhesion when applied directly to the painted substrate, it 
is usually necessary to first apply a primer to the painted surface. Such primers typically 
comprise a solution of a film-forming resin, such as a polyester resin, plus other components to 
enhance the strength of the adhesion between flange, primer, urethane adhesive, and vehicle 
window. For example U.S. Patent 4,525,511 describes a primer comprising a film-forming resin 
and a strong acid. U.S. Patent 4,643,794 describes a primer comprising 10 to 20 parts polyester 
resin, 4 to 5 parts polyisocyanate crosslinking agent, 3 to 9 parts carbon black, and 66 to 83 
parts volatile solvent. Such primers are applied directly to the painted vehicle flange, prior to 
bonding the window to the flange with a urethane adhesive. However, the use of such a solvent-based primer may result in the release into the 
assembly plant of a level of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which is more than is desired. In 
addition, the use of such primers typically result in some degree of misapplication of the 
primer, wherein the primer is accidentally dripped on to or applied to another painted surface 
of the vehicle, which may necessitate the "repair" of that part of the vehicle paint. Such paint 
repairs are costly and undesirable. It is also known to bond vehicle windows by first masking the flange before the 
vehicle is painted by the application of a solid pressure sensitive adhesive tape with a pressure 
sensitive adhesive on one side thereof, which is then removed after the vehicle is painted but 
before the vehicle window is adhesively bonded to the vehicle flange. However, this method is 
relatively labor intensive, and is not effectively automatable since the tape must be pressed to 
the flange over the entire area of the tape in order to cause the pressure sensitive adhesive to 
wet the flange sufficiently

<CLAIMS>
A process for bonding a vehicle window to a vehicle 
flange comprising the sequential steps of: 


a. applying a liquid masking composition to a 
vehicle flange; 
b. in either order painting the vehicle, and drying or curing the 
liquid masking composition sufficiently to form a removable 

mask; 
c. removing the mask from the flange; and 
d. adhesively bonding the vehicle window to the 
vehicle flange. 
The process of Claim 1 wherein the liquid masking 
composition is cured at a temperature of at least 250째F 

(120째C). 
The process of Claim 2 wherein the liquid masking 
composition is cured at a temperature of at least 325째F 

(163째C). 
The process of any one of the preceding Claims wherein 
the liquid masking composition is applied to the flange in 

a thickness of from 0.005 to 0.05 inch (0.0127 to 0.127cm). 
The process of any one of the preceding Claims wherein 
the vehicle flange comprises a metal substrate. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 4 wherein the 
vehicle flange comprises a plastic substrate. 
The process of Claim 5 wherein the vehicle flange 
additionally comprises a layer of a rust-resistant coating 

which has been applied to the metal substrate by 
electrodeposition means.  

 
The process of any one of the preceding Claims wherein 
the vehicle is painted prior to drying or curing the 

masking composition sufficiently to form a removable mask. 
The process of any one of the preceding Claims wherein 
the paint composition is dried or cured prior to removing 

the mask from the flange. 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
Claims, wherein a second paint composition is applied to 

the vehicle after drying or curing of the liquid masking 
composition to form a curable mask. 
A process as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
including the further step of painting the vehicle with a 

coat of an additional paint composition, and drying or 
curing the additional paint composition, prior to applying 

the liquid masking composition to the vehicle flange.
