<ABSTRACT>
The volume of the heat insulating material (15) enlarges when heated so that the covering (11,12) is expandable until it locates on the inside of a corresp. hollow space. The covering consists of a metal foil or of a temp.-proof ceramic fibre weave. It has at least two part surfaces (11,12), the edge areas (13,14) fo which are folded over, in order to form a widenable connection on volume alteration of the heat insulating material (15). The cover has expansion folds and the heat insulating material on heating from a starting temp. to a deformation temp. expands irreversibly. The heat insulating material (15) contains vermiculite and on the cover material (11) pressure compensation devices are provided.

A thermal turbo-engine having at least one hollow space 
which contains a heat insulation assembly (10) and is 

composed of housing parts (51, 52), said heat insulation 
assembly including a heat-insulating material (15) enclosed 

within a heat-resistant cover (11, 12), 
characterized in
 
that said cover (11, 12) is formed such that it permits a 

change in inner volume, that said heat-insulating material 
(15) consists of a heat-insulating material which increases 

its volume when heated, and said cover (11, 12) is 
expandable by means of the heat-insulating material which 

increases its volume when heated, for thermoautomatic 
volume expansion until contact with said housing parts (51, 

53) which offer resistance and define the hollow space. 
A thermal turbo-engine according to claim 1, 

characterized in
 that said cover (11, 12) is made of a 
metal foil. 
A thermal turbo-engine according to claim 1, 

characterized in
 that said cover (11, 12) is made of a 
temperature-resistant ceramic fiber tissue. 
A thermal turbo-engine according to any one of claims 1 
to 3, 
characterized in
 that said cover consists of at least 
two partial surfaces (11, 12) whose superimposed edge 

portions (13, 14) are folded to create a connection which 
is expandable upon change in volume of said heat-insulating 

material (15). 
A thermal turbo-engine according to any one of claims 1 
to 3, 
characterized in
 that said cover (31) comprises 
expansion folds (33).  

 
A thermal turbo-engine according to any one of claims 1 
to 3, 
characterized in
 that said cover consists of at least 
two partial surfaces (41, 42) whose edge portions (43) are 

arranged in overlapping fashion to create an increase in 
the inner volume upon increase in volume of said heat-insulating 

material (15). 
A thermal turbo-engine according to any one of claims 1 
to 6, 
characterized in
 that said heat-insulating material 
(15) is irreversibly expanded when heated from an initial 

temperature to a deformation temperature. 
A thermal turbo-engine according to any one of claims 1 
to 7, 
charaterized in
 that said heat-insulating material 
(15) contains vermiculite.

(80) are provided on said cover (11). 
A thermal turbo-engine according to claim 9, 

characterized in
 that said pressure compensating device 
(80) has an opening (82) in said cover (11), said opening being 

covered with at least one layer of microwire fabric (86) 
and a covering foil member (81). 
A thermal turbo-engine according to claim 10, 

characterized in
 that said microwire fabric (86) is 
arranged on the external side of said cover (11) in 

overlapping fashion above said opening (82) between said 
cover and said covering foil (81).

special configuration of said cover positioned at the gas 

side. 
An aircraft gas turbine according to any one of claims 
12, 13 or 14, 
characterized in
 that another hollow space 
receiving said thermal insulation assembly is formed by a 

recess which is arranged on the inside of said housing and 
is covered by a base member of a stationary and radially 

inwardly projecting turbine blade.
