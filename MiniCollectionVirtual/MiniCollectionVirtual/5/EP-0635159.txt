A method of manufacturing a bundle (33) of thread-like 
elements such as tubes or electric cables of finite length, 

in which the bundle includes at least one junction point 
for a branch (43), and in which the thread-like elements 

are enveloped in a plane thermofusible insulating material 
(31) that is wrapped transversely about the elements and 

that has its longitudinal edges united by welding, the 
method being characterized in that each of the branches 

(33,43) of the bundle is sheathed in succession by means of 
a respective tape (31) that is wrapped transversely and 

that has its edges (31a,31b) united by welding except at 
the location of each jonction point of each branch (13). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
heat for welding is provided by blowing hot air against the 

outside face of one margin (31a) of the tape (31) and 
against the inside face of the opposite margin (31b) while 

said margins are moving past the flow of hot air and while 
they are being held so as to form a groove, welding 

subsequently consisting in pressing one (31b) of the 
margins heated in this way against the other (31a). 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized 
in that the heat applied is regulated by diverting an 

adjustable fraction of the flow of hot air that would 
otherwise be directed into the angle of the above-mentioned 

groove. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that whenever a branch goes past, additional hot 

air is diverted. 
A machine for manufacturing a bundle (33) of thread-like 
elements such as tubes or electric cables of finite length,  

 
the bundle including at least one junction point for a 

branch (43), and the elements of the bundle being covered 
in a tape (31) of thermofusible insulating material wrapped 

transversely around the bundle with the longitudinal edges 
(31a, 31b) of the tape being united by welding, the machine 

being characterized in that it includes a welding head 
comprising two rows (7, 8) each of a plurality of drive 

wheels (9 to 14) for driving the bundle (33) and the tape 
(31) against which the wheels bear, a V-shape previously 

being imparted to the tape by- a guide (29) situated 
upstream from said wheels, said rows of wheels defining 

between them a through path (18) for the bundle, which path 
is upwardly open and passes successively beneath a first 

horizontal guide (23) for folding down one of the sides of 
the V-shape against the bundle, beneath a nozzle for 

blowing hot air into the angle formed between the 
folded-down side (31a) and the non-folded-down side (31b) 

of the V-shape, and beneath a second horizontal guide (25) 
for folding down the second side (31b) of the V-shape 

against the already folded-down first side (31a), the 
horizontal guides (23, 25) being retractable when branches 

(43) of the bundle (33) go past, the guides being retractable 
against return members (28) tending to keep them in 

the operating position. 
A machine according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the hot air blast nozzle (36) includes a vent outlet (39) 

upstream from its end over the through path (18), with the 
section of said outlet being opened or closed depending on 

whether a branch (43) of the bundle (33) is present or 
absent in the through path (18). 
A machine according to claim 5 or claim 6, characterized 
in that the width of the through path (18) for the bundle 

(33) is adjustable, each row of wheels being secured to a  
 

respective support block (7, 8) that is displaceable 
transversely to the through path (18) of the bundle against 

a return member (19) tending to minimize the width of the 
through path (18). 
A machine according to any one of claims 5 to 7, 
characterized in that the through path (18) is delimited by 

a bottom (32) that slopes relative to the direction of the 
wheel axes. 
A machine according to any one of claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that the upstream guide (29) for imparting 

a V-shape to the tape is adjustable in height as a function 
of the width of the through path (18). 
A machine according to any one of claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that the first and second horizontal 

folding-down guides (23, 25) are retractable between their 
operating positions over the through path (18) for the 

bundle and positions that disengage top access to the path 
for insertion of a new bundle to be sheathed. 
A machine according to any one of claims 5 to 10, 
characterized in that the hot air blast nozzle (36) 

includes a vent outlet (37) upstream from its end over the 
through path (18), the section of the outlet being adjustable 

as a function of the speed at which the bundle is 
driven by the wheels.
