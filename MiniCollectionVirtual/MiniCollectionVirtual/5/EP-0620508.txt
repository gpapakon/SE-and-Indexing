<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus as described for use in an electrostatographic printer/copier for 
cleaning particles from the imaging surface (11) and from the ground strip (130) located along 

the edge of the imaging surface. The apparatus comprises a conductive cleaning brush (100) 
for cleaning the imaging surface, and an insulative brush donut (120) attached to the 

conductive cleaning brush for cleaning the ground strip. The insulative brush donut will not 
short with the ground strip and prevents contact between the conductive fibers and the 

ground strip, which would short the ground strip and cause copy defects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an electrostatographic printer or copier, and more 
particularly concerns a cleaning apparatus used therein. In an electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a latent electrostatic information 
image is formed on an electrically insulating carrier. The latent image is developed into a 
visible image by the application of toner particles to the carrier surface, whereby the particles 
are caused to adhere electrostatically either to the portions of the carrier surface that are 
electrostatically charged or to the portions that are not charged and the adhered toner 
particles may then be transferred imagewise to an image receiving or record sheet. After the 
transfer, the insulating carrier is cleaned of residual toner particles and freed of the image 
charge pattern, and then reused in the production of another image. Effective and efficient cleaning of the residual particles (i.e. toner and other debris) 
from the insulating carrier is a critical operation, since any such residual particles will interfere 
with a subsequent image developed on the carrier. At the same time, it is important that the 
cleaning operation not damage the image carrier surface. Cylindrical brushes such as an 
electrostatic brush are commonly used in this type of cleaning operation. The basic function of the electrostatic brush cleaner is to carry a controlled voltage 
bias to remove charged toner from the photoreceptor surface. However, in cleaning the 
photoreceptor surface, residual particles of toner and other debris accumulate on the ground 
strip located along the edge(s) of the photoreceptor. This accumulation or build-up of residual 
particles can lead to print or copy quality defects if not removed. By its basic design, the 
electrostatic brush cleaner can not be used to clean the ground strip because it will short out to 
the grounded surface causing a print or copy quality defect. US-A-4,703,334 describes an electrophotographic apparatus having a photoreceptor belt provided on both sides with ground strips. Electrically non-conductive, and conductive side brushes are also provided. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an 
apparatus for cleaning particles from a photoreceptor surface having an electrical ground strip along a 
marginal region of the surface, comprising a housing defining an open ended chamber; a 
brush, rotatably mounted in the chamber of the housing, for removing particles from the 
surface; and nonconductive means, associated

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for cleaning particles from a photoreceptor surface (11) having an electrical ground 
strip (130) along a marginal region of the surface, comprising: 


a brush (100), rotatably mounted for removing particles from the surface; and 
non-conductive means (120), associated with the brush, for cleaning particles from the ground strip 
of the surface.
