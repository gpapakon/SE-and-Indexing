<ABSTRACT>
A process to manufacture and coat a sodium carbonate perhydrate containing 10.5 % to 14 % active oxygen which is stable in a non-phosphate detergent composition and which has a bulk density of from 900 to 1,050 kg/m3. Anhydrous sodium carbonate with a pore volume of at least 0.29 ml/g is contacted with 50 % to 75 % by weight hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid and water is evaporated at a rate to maintain a dry reaction mixture. The product is coated by sparging sodium borosilicate at a rate to avoid moistening the particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING AND COATING SODIUM CARBONATE PERHYDRATE TO BE STABLE IN DETERGENT FORMULATIONSThis invention is a process to manufacture a stable, sodium carbonate perhydrate composition that is stable in laundry detergent formulations and which readily releases its active oxygen in use.Sodium carbonate perhydrate has been recognized to be a desirable component for a detergent composi- tion because it is readily soluble in water, because it has a high active oxygen content, and because it also provides an inexpensive source of nonpolluting alkalinity. Pure sodium carbonate perhydrate con¬ forms to the chemical formula 2Na2Cθ3.3U2θ2 which contains 15.28% active oxygen (AO) . However, sodium carbonate perhydrate generally requires a coating to protect it from decomposition when formulated into a detergent and stored in an open container in a laundry room. Numerous processes have been proposed for manu¬ facturing sodium carbonate perhydrate (SCP) . One of the primary methods is a crystallization process in which aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate are mixed in a reactor and the SCP formed is filtered off. The product is usually salt¬ ed out by the addition of sodium chloride or other suitable reagents. Such processes are disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,380,620 and 2,541,733. While the crystallization process can produce a product with a bulk density of 900 kg/m3 or more and offers advan¬ tages such as good mixing and heat transfer, it has the disadvantage that there typically is a substan¬ tial loss of active oxygen in the mother liquor, so that low peroxygen efficiencies are obtained. That is, conversion of hydrogen peroxide utilized to active oxygen in the finished product is low. 

 In another method, taught by U.S. Pat. No. 3,555,696, SCP is made by a spray-drying process in which hydrogen peroxide solution is added immediately before atomization of a spray charge of sodium car- bonate in a spray tower. Thereafter the product SCP is dried, yielding a very dusty product with a very low bulk density.It is apparent from the prior art that large volumes of mother liquor are to be avoided. A pro- cess yielding high peroxygen efficiencies usually uses only a sufficiently large amount of water to act as a reaction medium and to provide a heat sink for the heat of reaction.The desire to minimize the amount of water in the reaction system has led to exploration of the so- called "dry" method. However, when the reaction is carried out in the absence of a sufficient amount of water,
