<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to benzoylacetylene derivatives and
salts thereof, more particularly to benzoylacetylene
derivatives and salts thereof having specific protein kinase
(referred to as "tyrosine kinase" hereinafter) inhibiting
activity.In chemotherapy for cancer, a lot of therapeutic agents
have been put into practical use. However, most of them are
not sufficiently effective in their therapeutic action. In
addition, growth inhibiting action of them is not limited to
cancer cells, and therefore, they often cause serious side-effects,
which make them unsatisfactory therapeutic agents.It is well known that tyrosine kinase plays an important
role in intercellular signal transduction and cell
differentiation or growth. Accordingly, failure of control of
tyrosine kinase activity in cells disorders intercellular
signal transduction and causes abnormal cell
differentiation/growth, which is considered to be directly
responsible for the development of various diseases. In
particular, it is known that tyrosine kinase is significantly
associated with disorderly overgrowth of cancer cells. In
fact, overexpression of tyrosine kinase is epidemiologically
observed in various carcinomas.On the basis of this finding, it has been proposed that an
agent specifically inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity would
be an anti-cancer agent having minor side-effects and exerting 
its therapeutic effect through novel mechanisms. Examples of
such agent are Erbstatin, Lavendustin, Herbimycin A, and
Genistein which are all derived from microorganisms.Additional example are synthetic compounds such as
benzylidenemalonitrile (Japanese Patent Publication Kokai No.
138238/1990; Journal of Medical Chemistry, 32 p2344, 1989;
ibid 34 p1896, 1991), α-cyanosuccinamide derivative (Japanese
Patent Publication Kokai No. 222153/1988) 3,5-diisopropyl-4-hydroxystyrene
derivative (Japanese Patent Publication Kokai
No. 39522/1987), 3-5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxystyrene derivative
(Japanese Patent Publication Kokai No. 39523/1987), and
Erbstatin analogue (Japanese Patent Publication Kokai No.
277347/1987).Tyrosine kinase inhibitors previously known possess too
moderate inhibitory activity to be used as an anti-cancer
agent. Accordingly, the purpose of the present invention is
to provide a family of novel compounds useful for suppressing
the growth of cancer cells, which compounds are easily
available, exhibit specific and intensive activity in
inhibiting tyrosine kinase of the growth factor receptor, and
show negligible side-effects that anti-cancer
