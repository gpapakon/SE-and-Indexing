<ABSTRACT>
A process of coining sintered articles of powder metal comprising: blending carbon, ferro manganese, and lubricant with compressible elemental iron powder, pressing the blended mixture to form the articles, high temperature sintering of the articles in a reducing atmosphere and then coining the sintered articles to final shape so as to narrow the tolerance variability of coined articles and substantially eliminate secondary operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
 AS SINTERED COINING PROCESSFIELD OF INVENTIONThis invention relates to a process of coining sintered articles to final shape and in particular relates to a process of precision coining sintered articles of powder metal having a composition of between 0.3% to 2.0% manganese, 0.2 to 0.85% carbon with the remainder being iron and unavoidable impurities where the sintered articles are coined to final shape so as to narrow the tolerance variability of the coined articles.Background to the InventionPowder metal technology is well known to the persons skilled in the art and generally comprises the formation of metal powders which are compacted and then subjected to an elevated temperature so as to produce a sintered product.Conventional sintering occurs at a maximum temperature of approximately up to 1,150 " C. Historically the upper temperature has been limited to this temperature by sintering equipment availability. Therefore copper and nickel have traditionally been used as alloying additions when sintering has been conducted at conventional temperatures of up to 1,150 °C, as their oxides are easily reduced at these temperatures in a generated atmosphere, of relatively high dew point containing CO, C02 and H2. The use of copper and nickel as an alloying material is expensive. Moreover, copper when utilized in combination with carbon as an alloying material and sintered at high temperatures causes dimensional instability and accordingly the use of same in a high temperature sintering process results in a more difficult process to control the dimensional characteristics of the desired product.Manufacturers of metal powders utilized in powder metal technology produce prealloyed iron powders which are generally more difficult to compact into complex shapes, particularly at higher densities (> 7.0 g/cc). Manganese and chromium can be incorporated into prealloyed powders provided special manufacturing precautions are taken to minimize the oxygen content, for example, by oil atomization. 

Notwithstanding this, these powders still have poor compressabilities compared to admixed powders.Conventional means to increase the strength of powder metal articles use up to 8% nickel, 4% copper and 1.5% molybdenum, in prealloyed, partially prealloyed, or admixed powders. Furthermore double press double sintering can be used for high performance parts as a means of increasing part density. Conventional elements are expensive and relatively ineffective for generating mechanical properties equivalent to wrought steel products,
