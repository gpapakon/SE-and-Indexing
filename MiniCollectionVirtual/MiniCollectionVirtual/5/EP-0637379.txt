<ABSTRACT>
A nitric oxide (NO) microsensor (34) based on catalytic oxidation of NO comprises a thermally-sharpened carbon fiber with a tip diameter of about 0.5-0.7  mu m coated with several layers of p-type semiconducting polymeric porphyrin and cationic exchanger deposited thereon. The microsensor (34) which can be operated in either the amperometric voltametric or coulometric mode utilizing a two or three electrode system, is characterized by a liner response up to about 300  mu M, a response time better than 10 msec and a detection limit of about 10 nM. The sensor (34) of the present invention also discriminates against nitrite, the most problematic interferant in NO measurements. The amount of NO released from a single cell can thus be selectively measured in situ by a porphyrinic microsensor (34) of the invention. A larger scale sensor (12) utilizing porphyrin and cationic exchanger deposited on larger fibers or wires, platinum mesh or tin indium oxide layered on glass, can also be employed when measurement of NO concentration in chemical media, tissue or cell culture is desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NITRIC OXIDE SENSOR RELATED APPLICATIONThis is a continuation of U.S. Application Serial No. 07/871 ,463, entitled "Nitric Oxide Sensor," filed April 21 , 1992, by Tadeusz Malinski, incorporated herein by reference.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to sensors and sensing techniques which can selectively and quantitatively detect NO in solution in both biological and chemical media. More specifically, the present invention relates to NO sensors which utilize conductive catalytic materials deposited on microfibers or other supports to monitor the presence or release of NO using amperometric, voltammetric or coulometric methods.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNitric oxide (NO) has recently been shown to be a key bioregulatory molecule in a number of physiological processes. For example, NO plays a major role in the biological activity of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF), abnormalities in which are associated with acute hypertension, diabetes, ischaemia and atherosclerosis. NO is also considered a retrograde messenger in the central nervous system, appears to be involved in the regulation of macrophage cytotoxic activity and platelet aggregation inhibition, and has been implicated in endotoxic shock and genetic mutations. In addition, a number of drugs and other xenobiotics are metabolized to produce NO as either the effector molecule or as a harmful metabolite. See e.g. Furchgott, R.F. et al.,Nature 288:373-376 (1980); Palmer, R.M. et al., Nature 327:524-526 (1987); Furchgott,R.F., "Mechanism of Vasodilation", IV:401-414 (ed. Vanhoutte, P.M.) (Raven, NY) (1988); Ignaro, LJ. et al., PNAS (USA) 84:9265-9269 (1987); Wei, E.P. et al., Cir. Res.57:781-787 (1985); Piper, G.M. et al., J. Am. J. Physiol. 24:4825-4833 (1988);Vanbethuysen, K.M. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 79:265-274 (1987); Freiman, P.C. et al., Circ.Res. 58:783-789 (1986); and Schuman, E.M. et al., Science 254:1503 (1991).Several different methods have been employed in the past to measure NO concentration in aqueous solution. For example, analysis of the ultimate aerobic oxidation products of NO, i.e. nitrite/nitrate (NO27NO3"), has been used as a measure of NO. Monitoring of UV-vis spectral changes resulting from the conversion of oxyhemoglobin to met-hemoglobin has also been used as an indicator of NO concentration. These methods, however, provide only an indirect and thus less accurate measurement of NO. NO has also been measured in biological systems 

using a Thermal Energy Analyzer (TEA), in which NO reacts
