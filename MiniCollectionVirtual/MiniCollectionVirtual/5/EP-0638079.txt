<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain deazaaminopterin compounds useful for the treatment of
inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis, as well as a process for making such
compounds and a method of using such compounds.DeGraw et al., U. S. Patent 4,369,319, issued January 19, 1983, disclose a class of 10-deazaaminopterin
compounds having the structure of formula:
In the compound 10-deazaaminopterin, R1 and R2 are both hydrogen. In the alkyl
derivatives of Patent No. 4,369,319, either or both of R1 and R2 is alkyl having from one to
about eight, preferably one or two, carbon atoms. When only one of R1 and R2 is alkyl, the
other is hydrogen. Exemplary R1 and R2 alkyl include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl,
isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, amyl, iso-amyl, sec-amyl, tert-amyl, hexyl, iso-hexyl, heptyl, iso-heptyl,
octyl, iso-octyl, 2-ethyl hexyl and tert-octyl.DeGraw et al., J.Med.Chem.,17, 552 (1974), report on the synthesis and antifolate
activity of 10-deazaaminopterin. The antimicrobial and antitumor activities of the powerful
dihydrofolic reductase inhibitors aminopterin and its N-10 methyl derivative, methotrexate, are
well known, and numerous analogues have been made to further improve the potency, cell
penetration, and toxicity properties of these compounds. As part of a continuing program to
investigate structure-activity relationships in folic acid analogues, DeGraw et al. were interested
in the effects of replacement of the nitrogen atom in the side chain of aminopterin and reported 
on the synthesis and biological activity of 10-deazaaminopterin. Continuing work with 10-deazaaminopterin
and its 10-alkyl derivatives led to the discovery of their antileukemic activity,
and to their efficacy in treating various ascites tumor systems.In accordance with U. S. Patent 4,369,319, it was determined that leukemia, as well as
other malignancies, including ascitic tumors, can be ameliorated in warm-blooded lower animals
by the administration of 10-deazaaminopterin, a nontrivial analogue of methotrexate, the current
drug of choice for the treatment of leukemia in the clinic, as well as 10-alkyl derivatives of 10-deazaaminopterin,
and it is expected that these compounds will have a similar effect in humans.Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammation of the joints arising from infectious, metabolic,
or constitutional causes, usually of unknown origin. It can result in serious restriction of
movement and even invalidism. Since rheumatoid arthritis is a common disease that affects 2-3
million people
