<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
apoptosis regulating composition. The apoptosis regulating composition of the 
invention comprises, as an active ingredient, at least one 
member of the class consisting of carbostyril derivatives 
represented by any of the following general formula (1) 
through general formula (6) (hereinafter referred to as 
compound (1) through compound (6) respectively) and 6-[4-(3,4-dimethoxybenzoyl)-1-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazyl]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril (hereinafter referred to as compound 
(7)) inclusive of salts thereof. 
(1) Carbostyril derivatives of the following general 
formula 
 
wherein R is a benzoyl group which may optionally have, on 
the phenyl ring thereof, one to three substituents each 
selected from the group consisting of lower alkoxy groups, 
halogen atoms, lower alkyl groups, lower alkanoylamino  
 
groups and lower alkylthio groups; a lower 
alkylenedioxybenzoyl group; a hydrogen atom; a 
pyridylcarbonyl group; a lower alkanesulfonyl group; a 
lower alkynyl group; or a phenyl-lower alkyl group which 
may optionally have, on the phenyl ring thereof, one to 
three substituents each selected from the group consisting 
of lower alkoxy groups, halogen atoms and lower alkyl 
groups; the carbon-carbon bond between the 3 and 4 
positions of the carbostyril skeleton is a single bond or 
a double bond; R²⁰ is a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl 
group, a lower alkenyl group, a lower alkynyl group or a 
phenyl-lower alkyl group; and R²¹ is a hydrogen atom or a 
lower alkoxy group; provided, however, that where both of 
R²⁰ and R²¹ 
are hydrogen atoms, R should not be a benzoyl 
group which may have a lower alkoxy group as a phenyl ring 
substituent; and salts thereof; (2) Carbostyril derivatives of the following general 
formula 
 
wherein R¹ is a group of the formula 
 
(R³ being a hydrogen atom or a benzoyl group and R⁴ being  
 
an oxo group) and the carbon-carbon bond between the 3 and 
4 positions of the carbostyril skeleton is a single bond 
or a double bond; and salts thereof; (3) Carbostyril derivatives of the following general 
formula 
 
wherein R⁵ is a lower alkanoyl group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl 
group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl-lower alkyl group, 
a phenyl-lower alkyl group having a lower alkanoyloxy 
group or a hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring thereof, or a 
benzoyl group which may optionally have, on the phenyl 
ring thereof, at least one substituent selected from the 
group consisting of a hydroxyl group and amino groups 
optionally having a lower alkyl
