<ABSTRACT>
A system for scheduling gear ratio changes in an 
automatic transmission and controlling operation of a torque 

converter bypass clutch (98) includes a microprocessor (60); 
electronic memory (62) containing control algorithms, lookup 

tables, functions and constants; solenoid-operated shift 
valves (70,72,74), a variable force solenoid (76), friction 

clutches, brakes and sensors (80), and planetary gear units. 
A table of calibrated performance weighting factors (PWF) is 

used to alter reference schedules of gear ratio changes 
based on the extent to which high performance operation is 

desired rather than economy operation. The PWFs are used to 
adjust gear shift points based on inferences drawn from 

engine throttle position and time rate of change of throttle 
position. Hydraulic pressure supplied to the friction 

elements and the schedule of unlocked and modulated 
operation of the torque converter (100) are adjusted from 

reference schedules and pressures on the basis of PWF 
values.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the control of upshifts and 
downshifts of an electronically-controlled automatic 
transmission. More particularly, the invention pertains to 
scheduling gear ratio changes on the basis of inferences 
drawn from current use of the vehicle engine and 
transmission. Conventionally an electronically-controlled automatic 
transmission is provided with a gearshift schedule that 
defines when each gear ratio change is to occur on the basis 
of current engine throttle position and vehicle speed. 
Generally, data from lookup tables stored in electronic 
memory relating vehicle speed and engine throttle position, 
for each of the gear ratio changes, are used to produce a 
signal representing the desired gear ratio. When the 
desired gear ratio is different from the current gear ratio, 
a command signal is produced by the control to cause a 
change in state of solenoid-operated shift valves and a 
reduction of torque carried by an off-going friction element 
and an increase of torque carried by an on-coming friction 
element. This changes the state of the planetary gear units 
and cause the gear ratio to change. Generally a reference schedule of gearshift boundaries, 
expressed in terms of vehicle speed and engine throttle 
position, is stored in memory. The schedule is continually 
referenced and used to produce an upshift signal or 
downshift signal when a boundry is crossed. U.S. Patents 4,669,335; 4,807,497; and 4,823,642 
describe a switch used by the vehicle operator to signify 
preference for the transmission to be operated in economy 
mode or performance mode. The state of the mode switch is 
used as input information by a microprocessor so that 
decisions to change gear ratios are made with reference to a 
first standard gearshift schedule whose shift points are 
established for use in the economy mode and a second 
schedule for use in the performance mode. U.S. Patents 
4,338,666; 4,350,057; 4,474,081; 4,584,906; 4,679,145; and  
 
4,733,580 disclose transmission control techniques wherein 
the gearshift schedule corresponding to either economy or 
performance mode of operation is automatically selected on 
the basis of vehicle operating parameters. US Patent 5,152,192 describes a vehicle automatic 
transmission including a control which adjusts the gear 
shift control parameters in response to the driving habits 
of the driver, as judged by an indication of the average 
peak acceleration during specified operations of the 
vehicle. The transmission has a source of fluid
