<ABSTRACT>
A temperature-dependent switching device having a thermostatic operating element (11) and having an electrical switching element (12) which is operated by said thermostatic operating element (11), which two elements are accommodated in a common enclosure (30) which has a receptacle (31) for an expanding material (32). This receptacle (31) is closed by a membrane (diaphragm) (33) on which an operating piston (40) is seated. This operating piston (40) is guided in a cut-out (35) in a guidance part (36) which is situated above it and is assigned to a switching part (17) of the switching element (12), which is fitted on a mounting plate (13). The enclosure (30) is formed from a sheet-metal moulding (42) which has an attachment (43) with a bowl-shaped receptacle (31) for the expanding material (32), is common to the operating element (11) and the switching element (12) and accommodates both, the guidance part (36) being held by a part (50) of the sheet-metal moulding (42).

Temperature-dependent switching device with a thermostatic operating element 
(11) and an electric switch element (12) activated by the latter which are both 

accommodated in a housing, which comprises a metal receptacle (31) for an 
expanding material (32) sealed by a rubber-elastic membrane (33) which is 

opposite an operating piston (40) guided into a recess (35) of a guiding 
element (36) and assigned to a switch part (17) of the electric switch element 

(12) which is attached to a support plate (13), in particular made of plastic, from 
which electric connecting elements (14) project outwards,
characterised in that
 the housing (30) is formed by sheet metal 
moulding (42) comprising a projection (43) with a bowl-shaped receptacle (31) 

for the expanding material (32) common to the thermostatic operating element 
(11) and the electric switch element (12) and accommodating both of the latter, 

which sheet metal moulding extends in one piece from the bowl-shaped 
receptacle (31) to the support plate (13) of the electric switch element (12). 
Switching device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
sheet metal moulding (42) extends up to an outer edge (45) of the support plate 

(13) and surrounds the outer edge (45) and in that the support plate (13) is 
secured to the sheet metal moulding (42) by the plastic deformation of the edge 

(46) of the sheet metal moulding (42) in the region of outer edge (45).  
 
Switching device according to one of claims 1 to 2, 
characterised in 
that
 the guiding element (36) is held between the sheet metal moulding (42) 
and its projection (43). 
Switching device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in 
that
 the guiding element (36) is supported on a bearing surface (38) of the 
sheet metal moulding (42), in particular the projection (43) thereof, surrounding 

the receptacle (31). 
Switching device according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in 
that
 the guiding element (36) is pressed against the bearing surface (38) by 
part of the sheet metal moulding (42) with the elastic deformation of the edge 

(34, 37) of the membrane (33). 
Switching device according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in 
that
 the sheet metal moulding (42) comprises one or several inwardly 
directed retaining means (50) for the guiding element (36) at least slightly 

overlapping the guiding element (36) on the side facing the electric switch 
element (12). 
Switching device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the 
retaining means (50) are in one piece with the sheet metal moulding (42). 
Switching device according to one of claims 6 and 7, 
characterised in 
that
 the retaining means (50) are formed by projections (51, 52) directed 
inwards from the outside which are shaped preferably pressed out of the 

material of the sheet metal moulding (42). 
Switching device according to one of claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in 
that
 the retaining means (50), in particular projections (51, 52), are formed 
by beads or studs or the like.  

 
Switching device according to one of claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in 
that
 a peripheral bead or several beads spaced apart consecutively in 
peripheral direction are provided as retaining means (50), in particular 

projections (51, 52). 
Switching device according to one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterised in 
that
 one or several wall indentations, wall constrictions, wall depressions, 
inclinations e.g. truncated cone-shaped walls, an inwardly directed shoulder or 

similar wall designs of the sheet metal moulding (42) are provided as retaining 
means (50), in particular projections.
