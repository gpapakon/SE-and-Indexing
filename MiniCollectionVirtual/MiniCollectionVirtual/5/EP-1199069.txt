<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to methods and kits useful for improving or
maintaining urogenital health using an estrogen agonist / antagonist. The methods

of treatment are effective for improving or maintaining urogenital health while
substantially reducing the concomitant liability of adverse effects associated with

estrogen administration. This invention also relates to methods of assessing
vaginal health.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for improving or maintaining
urogenital health using an estrogen agonist / antagonist. In postmenopausal
women, conditions such as urinary and vaginal infections; incontinence; and vaginal
dryness can be treated using the methods of the present invention. The present
invention also relates to methods of assessing vaginal health.Menopause occurs naturally in women at an average age of 50 to 51 years
in the United States. As ovaries age, response to pituitary gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating
hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) decreases, initially
resulting in shorter follicular phases (thus, shorter menstrual cycles), fewer
ovulations, decreased progesterone production, and more irregularity in menstrual
cycles. Eventually, the follicle fails to respond and does not produce estrogen. The
transitional phase, during which a woman passes out of the reproductive stage,
begins before menopause. It is termed the climacteric or perimenopause, although
many persons refer to it as menopause.Premature menopause refers to ovarian failure of unknown cause that
occurs before age 40. It may be associated with smoking, living at high altitude, or
poor nutritional status. Artificial menopause may result from oophorectomy,
chemotherapy, radiation of the pelvis, or any process that impairs ovarian blood
supply or ovarian function.Symptoms of the climacteric range from nonexistent to severe. Hot flushes
(flashes) and sweating secondary to vasomotor instability affect 75% of women
going through the perimenopausal period. Most have hot flushes for more than 1
year, and 25 to 50% for more than 5 years. The woman feels warm or hot and may
perspire, sometimes profusely. The skin, especially of the head and neck, becomes
red and warm. The flush, which may last from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, may be
followed by chills. Vasomotor symptoms of the hot flush coincide with the onset of
LH pulses, but not every increase in LH is associated with a hot flush, suggesting
that hypothalamic control of LH pulses is independent of that of flushes. This 
independence is confirmed by the occurrence of hot flushes in women who have
had pituitary failure and do not secrete LH and/or FSH.The large reduction in estrogen leads to profound changes in the lower
genital tract; e.g., the vaginal mucosa and vulvar skin become thinner, the normal
bacterial flora changes, and the labia minora, clitoris, uterus, and ovaries decrease
in size. Inflammation of the vaginal mucosa (atrophic vaginitis) can cause
