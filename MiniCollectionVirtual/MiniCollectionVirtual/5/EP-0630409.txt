<ABSTRACT>
Novel vectors are capable of producing MPMV (Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus) proteins but not of packaging MPMV RNA, and the information about the packaging signal in MPMV and HIV can be used to create MPMV and HIV vectors that are capable of transferring foreign genes, e.g. for use in gene therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vectors and their use in
gene transfer. The vectors are based on retroviruses,
adapted so that they cannot package their own RNA, and
which can be used as infectious agents to transfer foreign
genes, e.g. for somatic gene therapy.Retroviruses are classified in several ways. They are
divided into various groups on the basis of their
morphology. These groups are A,B,C and D type viruses.
They are also classified as belonging to one of three
subfamilies, namely oncoviruses, spumaviruses and
lentiviruses.Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus (MPMV) is a D-type
retrovirus first discovered in breast carcinoma tissue from
a rhesus monkey. Despite this, and its classification into
the oncovirus subfamily, it does not contain an identified
oncogene and there is no evidence that it has oncogenic
potential.D-type viruses are distinguished from other retrovirus
families such as the C-type viruses. The latter are
characterised by capsid assembly at the cell membrane, and
include viruses of the lentivirus group, e.g. Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Morphologically, in their
core structure, D-type viruses also differ from B-type
viruses such as Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). Thus the
D-type viruses are completely distinct from these other
types and as an example of this distinction they have
specific signals in the form of amino-acid signal sequences
in their assembled ICAP which facilitate transport of the
ICAP to the cell membrane. For this reason and others they
must be considered as a separate group with unique cis and
trans-acting regulatory signals. MPMV is also
distinguished from C-type viruses by the ability of the
virus envelope to activate the human complement system.
This leads to lysis of the virus. Retroviruses are RNA viruses which replicate through
a DNA proviral intermediate which is integrated in the
genome of the infected host cell. The virion particle
contains a dimer of positive-strand genomic RNA molecules.
This genomic RNA is the full-length species transcribed
from the proviral DNA by the host RNA polymerase II. A
proportion of these full length RNAs which encode the gag
and pol genes of the virus are translated by the host cell
ribosomes, to produce the structural and enzymic proteins
required for production of virion particles. The provirus
also gives rise to a variety of smaller singly and
multiply-spliced mRNAs coding for the envelope proteins
and, in the case of more complex retroviruses, a group of
regulatory proteins. The genomic (and subgenomic) RNA
molecules are
