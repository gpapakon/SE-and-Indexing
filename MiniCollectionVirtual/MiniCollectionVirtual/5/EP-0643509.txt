<ABSTRACT>
Character codes input from a keyboard (1) are 
transmitted (10) to a remote computer which transmits the 

codes back by way of acknowledgement. A local display (7) 
does not await the acknowledgement before displaying the 

characters but, rather, displays them right away and erases 
them if the acknowledgement is not received within a set 

period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data transmission 
terminals. Such terminals commonly transmit characters entered by 
means of a keyboard, to a remote computer or other device. 
The remote computer acknowledges by echoing the transmitted 
character code and the terminal then displays the received 
character on a visual display screen. One problem that can 
arise with such an arrangement is that if the link between 
the terminal and the remote equipment is particularly slow 
(or the remote equipment is) there can be a long pause before 
keystrokes are echoed to the screen. This leads to users 
striking a key twice or more with obvious resulting problems. Of course, it would be possible to echo the characters 
directly to the screen but the user then receives no feedback 
that his signals are reaching their intended destination. According to the present invention there is provided 
a data communication terminal having a keyboard for input of 
characters, transmitter means for transmitting coded signals 
representing those characters, receiver means for receiving 
echoed characters as a form of acknowledgement, and visual 
display means operable to display characters, characterised 
by control means operable in response to an input signal from 
the keyboard to display the corresponding character on the 
visual display means and operable in the absence, within a 
defined time period, receipt of a corresponding echoed 
character to erase the displayed character. For example the terminal may include a buffer for 
storing characters input from the keyboard and not yet 
transmitted, the control means being operable in the event of 
the said absence of an echoed character to erase any 
characters stored in the buffer and their corresponding 
representations on the visual display means. Preferably the 
control means is arranged to inhibit transmission of a 
character until an echoed character corresponding to the  
 
immediately preceding transmitted character has been 
received. Some embodiments of the invention will now be 
described by way of example, with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a terminal apparatus 
according to one embodiment of the present invention; Figures 2 to 4 are diagrams illustrating the operation 
of the apparatus of Figure 1; and Figures 5 and 6 are flowcharts illustrating the 
operation of a second embodiment of the invention. In the embodiment of figure 1, a keyboard 1 produces 
character codes on an output line 2 and indicates that a

A terminal according to claim 1 including a buffer for 
storing characters input from the keyboard and not yet 

transmitted, the control means being operable in the event of 
the said absence of an echoed character to erase any 

characters stored in the buffer and their corresponding 
representations on the visual display means. 
A terminal according to claim 2 in which the control 
means is arranged to inhibit transmission of a character 

until an echoed character corresponding to the immediately 
preceding transmitted character has been received. 
A terminal according to claim 1, 2 or 3 in which the 
control means is operable in response to receipt of an echoed 

character to change the appearance of the corresponding 
displayed character.
