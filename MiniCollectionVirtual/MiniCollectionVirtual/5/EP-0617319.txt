<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to roll films for
cameras and to cartridges and cameras containing the
films.While many different techniques for imaging
are known, for candid photography using hand-held
cameras the overwhelming choice is to employ a film
that records images in one or more silver halide emulsion
layer units coated on a film base. The film is
most frequently purchased in a single or double roll
cartridge that contains a film strip of sufficient
length to provide 12, 24 or 36 exposure frames. More
recently interest has revived in single use cameras
containing preloaded film, first introduced before the
turn of the century by George Eastman. By feeding the
film from a tightly spooled roll for exposure and then
again spooling the exposed film, the film and camera
together can form a compact imaging unit.Silver halide emulsions contain radiation
sensitive microcrystals (grains) dispersed in a vehicle.
The highest attainable photographic speeds and
the best balances of photographic speed and image
quality (hereinafter also referred to as speed-granularity
relationships) have been traditionally realized
with silver iodobromide emulsions. Silver bromide
emulsions have been sparingly used for hand held camera
photography while silver chloride containing emulsions
and particularly high chloride emulsions, though
clearly functional, have not found manufacturing acceptance,
because of the superior performances of the
other available halides. The term "high chloride"
refers to grains that contain at least 50 mole percent
chloride based on silver. In referring to grains of
mixed halide content, the halides are named in order of
increasing molar concentrations--e.g., silver iodochloride
and silver iodobromide each contain a higher 
molar concentration of chloride or bromide, respectively,
than iodide.During the 1980's a marked advance took place
in silver halide photography based on the discovery
that a wide range of photographic advantages, such as
improved speed-granularity relationships, increased
covering power both on an absolute basis and as a
function of binder hardening, more rapid developability,
increased thermal stability, increased separation
of native and spectral sensitization imparted
imaging speeds, and improved image sharpness in both
mono- and multi-emulsion layer formats, can be achieved
by employing tabular grain emulsions.One of the very few areas in which the
performance of tabular grain emulsions has not exceeded
that obtainable with nontabular grain emulsions as been
in the area of

A photographic camera film comprised of
at least one radiation sensitive silver halide emulsion

layer unit and a film base in a roll satisfying the
formula


L - SD
TU x 2
 - FBT = 10 to 60 µm

FBT is the thickness of the film base;
L is the diameter in micrometers (µm) of the film
roll;
SD is the spool diameter in µm of the film roll,
where when the film is rolled on a spindle, the spool

diameter is the diameter of the spindle and, when the
film is rolled on itself, the spool diameter is the

inside diameter of the film roll; and
TU is the number of film turns in the film roll;

characterized in that at least one emulsion layer unit
is comprised of a radiation sensitive emulsion containing

a silver halide grain population comprised of at
least 50 mole percent chloride, based on silver, at

least 50 percent of the grain population projected area
being accounted for by tabular grains (1) bounded by

{100} major faces having adjacent edge ratios of less

claim 1 further characterized in that the formula range

is form 20 to 50 µm.

claim 1 or 2 further characterized in that the film base

is a cellulose ester film base having a thickness in the
range of from 100 to 200 µm. 
A photographic camera film according to
claim 1 or 2 further characterized in that the film base

is comprised of a polyester of a dibasic aromatic
carboxylic acid and a dihydroxy alcohol. 
A photographic camera film according to
claim 4 further characterized in that the film base is

less than 100 µm in thickness.
A photographic camera film according to
claim 1 or 2 further characterized in that the film base

is comprised of poly(ethylene terephthalate) or
cellulose triacetate.

form and a housing surrounding the film for protecting
the film from exposure and including an opening for

withdrawing the film from the cartridge receptacle.
A film cartridge according to claim 7
further characterized in that the housing is comprised

of a first receptacle portion containing the film in
roll form, a guide portion forming a planar extension of

the first receptacle portion for receiving the film from
the first receptacle portion and providing a focal plane

for imagewise exposure of the film, and a second receptacle
portion forming an extension of the guide portion

for receiving and storing in roll form exposed portions
of the film.
A camera comprised of a lens, a shutter,
a film in roll form, means for holding the film in roll

form prior to exposure, means for mounting a portion of
the film for exposure through the lens, means for

receiving portions of the film from the mounting means,
and a housing for mounting the lens and shutter and for

restricting light access to the film to that entering
the camera through the lens, characterized i
