<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a nozzle device for equipping chisel bits (13) of a holing machine in which the chisel bits are configured as round shank chisel bits (13) having a hard material or hard metal insert. The nozzles (19) are oriented in the direction of the cutting path, whereby water is supplied over a part of the rotation of the cutting heads (11) or cutting rollers by means of a sector control. In order to decrease the wear of the hard metal or hard material inserts, the invention provides that the axes (22) of the nozzles (19) are arranged such that they are sloped toward the chisel bit tips (23) and toward the cutting path. In addition, the sector control is adjusted in such a way that the nozzles (19) are actuated with pressurized water over an angle ranging from at least 45 DEG , preferably between 65 DEG  and 85 DEG , of the rotation of the cutting head (11) or of the cutting roller after the chisel bit (13) exits the rock. The nozzles (19) are actuated by a pressure exceeding 50 bar.

<CLAIMS>
A nozzling device for the chisels (13) of a cutting machine
in which the chisels are designed as round shank chisels (13)

each including a hard-material or hard-metal insert and the
nozzles (19) are oriented in the direction of the cutting

trace, wherein the water supply is effected via a sector
control over a portion of the revolution of the cutting heads

(11) or cutting rolls, 
characterized in that
 the axes (22) of
the nozzles (19) are arranged to be inclined towards the

chisel tips (23) and into the cutting trace, and that the
sector control is adjusted to feed the nozzles (19) with water

under pressure over an angular portion of at least 45°,
preferably 65° to 85°, of the revolution of the cutting head

(11) or cutting roll, respectively, upon emergence of the
chisels (13) from the rock.
A nozzling device according to claim 1; 
characterized in
that
 the nozzles (19) are designed as swirl nozzles.
A method for nozzling the round shank chisels. (13) of a
cutting machine according to claim 1, 
characterized by

arranging the nozzles (19) in a manner inclined at an acute
angle relative to the axes of rotation (16) of the round shank

chisels (13) and feeding water under pressure to said nozzles
at a pressure of more than 50 bar until the chisels (13) have

been moved out of the rock over a central angle of at least
45°, preferably 65° to 85°.
A method according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 said
feeding of water is effected in an intermittent or pulsed

manner.
A method according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that

the water pressure is selected between 60 and 120 bar. 
A method according to any one of claims 3 to 5,

characterized in that
 the top temperature of the hard-metal or
hard-material insert of the round shank chisel (13) is kept

lower than a critical temperature being a function of the hard
metal.
A method according to claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the
cutting speed is reduced as the top temperature approaches

said critical temperature.
A method according to any one of claims 3 to 7,

characterized in that
 the cutting speed of the chisels (13) is
selected between 0.8 and 1.6 ms
-1
.
A method according to any one of claims 3 to 8,

characterized in that
 nozzling is started upon entry of the
chisel (13) into the rock.
