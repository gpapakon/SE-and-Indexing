<ABSTRACT>
Process for the trichromatic dyeing or printing of natural or synthetic polyamide fibre materials, characterised in that a yellow- or orange-dyeing dye of the formula (1) 
<
IMAGE
>
  is used together with a red-dyeing dye of the formula (2) or (3) 
<
IMAGE
>
 and together with a mixture of the blue-dyeing dyes of the formulae (4) and (5) 
<
