<ABSTRACT>
A core of edible ice confection consisting of the usual 
components of an edible ice in a suitable configuration has 

a thin coating of a mixture of gelatin, sugar, glucose 
syrup and water with a point of fusion sufficiently higher 

than that of the edible ice to have a protective effect and 
prevent thawing on contact with the fingers during 

consumption. 
The gelatin is hydrated in part of the water at 70°C, while 
the sugar is separately dissolved in the rest of the water 

at boiling point. The glucose syrup and the hydrated 
gelatin are then added to the dissolved sugar, the mixture 

is left to cool to a temperature of 60-65°C and additives 
such as citric acid, colour and flavouring are added. This 

product is moulded and frozen, and the appropriate amount 
of the edible ice confection constituting the cores is 

deposited into it. The end product may be obtained by the 
insertion of a stick or support and has a transparent and 

unbreakable coating.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in edible ice 
products of type commonly called ice confections. More 
specifically it relates to those intended to be held in the 
hand during consumption, which are specially structured so 
as to prevent the ice from melting because of the heat 
transmitted during consumption and to keep the ice in a 
stable condition for an appropriate time to allow 
consumption. The invention is applicable to ice 
confections in general; examples are ice cream, ice milk, 
frozen yoghurts, frozen custards, water ice and sorbets. The wide range of forms or versions in which edible ice 
confections reach the consumer includes blocks of different 
sizes or shapes that are offered to the consumer in 
suitable packaging. At the time of consumption the ice is 
removed from the packaging and held in the hand and it has 
an outer coating intended to prevent the block from melting 
due to the effect of heat flowing into it from the fingers. 
This coating is generally based on chocolate. This solution requires immediate consumption of the product 
when it is taken from the refrigerator, as the chocolate 
starts to melt within a very short time when in contact 
with the fingers, because its melting point is quite low, 
in some cases even lower than that of the ice. This means 
that in reality the coating does not prevent soiling of the 
consumer's fingers. The true purpose of this type of coating is not to prevent 
the ice from melting but to offer a complementary flavour 
so that the flavour of the said coating contrasts with or  
 
complements that of the block of ice confection inside it. One solution is supplied in Spanish patent application 
9200586, comprising the covering of an "ice" core of any 
conventional composition with a coating based on an edible 
vegetable fat mixed with sugars. It has certain 
proportions of its components and a suitable thickness so 
that, as the vegetable fat has melting point considerbly 
higher than that of the "ice", the product may be held in 
the hand long enough for its consumption without making the 
hands dirty. However, the product obtained in this patent appliction can 
be improved in terms of its presentation and composition 
and of the process by which it is obtained. The improvements that are the object of this present 
invention use different components in the mixture to obtain 
the coating, and also include modifications to the process 
for obtaining the product for this variation in these 
components. More specifically, the improvements

<CLAIMS>
Edible ice product consisting of an ice confection 
forming a core representing the major part of the product 

covered by a thin coating with improved resistance to 
melting characterised in that the coating is based on a 

mixture of gelatin and sugars. 
An ice product according to claim 1 wherein the 
coating has a thickness in the range about 0.5 to 3.0mm. 
An ice product according to Claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
coating is transparent. 
An ice product according to any preceding claim 
wherein the coating comprises: 

3 to 10%gelatin 20 to 35%sugar 30 to 50%glucose syrup in an aqueous base 
A method of preparing an edible ice product comprising 
the stages: 


i) hydration of the gelatin in part of the water; 
ii) dissolution of the sugar in the rest of the water 
at boiling point; 
iii) addition of the glucose syrup and hydrated 
gelatin to the dissolved sugar; 
iv) allowing the mixture to reach a temperature 
between 60 and 65°C, with elimination of the 

froth; 
v) optional addition of the acid, colouring and 
flavouring; 
vi) putting the coating mixture into moulds, freezing 
and removal of the inner part of the moulds; 
vii) introduction into the moulded and solid mixture 
 

of the ice product constituting the core and 
insertion of the stick or support; 
viii) demoulding and optional packaging of the product.
