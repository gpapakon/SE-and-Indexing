<ABSTRACT>
A database is reconfigured by the manipulation of table and column 
icons on a user interactive graphical display interface to said 

database. In the interactive display, columns are represented by icons 
57, 60 and tables are represented by icons 44, 45 which in turn 

represent combinations of columns. One or more of the table icons are 
decomposed into the column icons making up the tables. The column icons 

are displayed in pool areas 56 on said display from which the user may 
interactively select column icons and combine such column icons to form 

a new table represented by a table icon 83.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the processing of databases and 
particularly to databases which may be configured through the user 
manipulation of display icons. Databases have become the subject of significant recent interest, 
not only because of the increasing volume of data being stored and 
retrieved by computerized databases, but also by virtue of the data 
relationships which can be established during the storage and retrieval 
processes. Most of the interest in databases has concerned user demands 
for an improved ergonomic interface. One aspect of improved ergonomics is the ability to convey 
information from a database in a meaningful way to a user. An early 
attempt at this type of processing is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,506,326 
to Shaw et al, entitled, Apparatus and Method for Synthesizing a Query 
for Accessing a Relational Database. The patent disclosed a method and 
apparatus for preparing a linear query to access a relational database 
and obtain information for display to a user in a linear, sequential 
report of alphanumeric information. Structured Query Language (SQL), and in particular ANSI SQL, has 
become a preferred language media for communicating queries to 
relational databases. As a consequence, there presently exist thousands 
of relational databases and thousands of related queries directed to 
such databases. In view of the great investment of resources in such 
databases and queries, any new ergonomic interface to database should 
use and access such databases and queries. With the growing prevalence of relational databases, communication 
networks and workstations, the training and experience of a 
representative system user has decreased in relation to the resources 
available. The dilemma created by these various events is threefold. 
First, there exists an established and valuable base of queries 
formulated with classical SQL expressions. Second, there is a growing 
usage of relational databases and networks accessing their information.  
 
The end users of such databases are routinely less proficient in the 
very tools needed to efficiently and accurately access the relational 
database information. Finally, users of database access methods do not 
receive direct feedback of changes based on their manipulation of the 
database. Thus, in recent years, a great deal of innovation in database 
management has been driven by user demands for improved ergonomic 
interfaces to the database through interactive displays. A recent innovation to improve the ergonomic interface to

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing a database in which data is stored in a 
structure of tables, each table comprising one or more columns (46, 50, 

51), the method comprising: 
   graphically representing a table as a combination of columns, each 

column being represented by an icon (57, 60) on a display, by 
decomposing at least one of said tables into discrete column icons; 

   displaying said discrete column icons in at least one pool area 
(56); 

   and responsive to the user selecting column icons from said at 
least one pool area, combining said column icons to form a new table 

(83). 
The method of claim 1 wherein each table is graphically 
represented on said display by a respective table icon (44, 45). 
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein said step of decomposing a 
table includes pointing to the respective table icon. 
The method of claim 3 wherein said step of decomposing a table 
further includes the step of moving the table icon into said at least 

one pool area whereupon said decomposition into said column icons 
occurs. 
The method of any preceding claim wherein the user selects column 
icons to be combined by moving them from said at least one pool area 

into a further pool area (82). 
The method of claim 5 further including the step of eliminating 
all table associations from the column icons in said further pool area 

and from the stored columns which said icons respectively represent. 
The method of any preceding claim further including the step of 
determining column icons in said pool areas which represent redundant 

columns. 
The method of claim 7 further including removing the icons 
representing redundant columns from said pool areas. 
Apparatus for processing a database in which data is stored in a 
structure of tables, each table comprising one or more columns (46, 50, 

51), comprising: 
   means for graphically representing a table as a combination of 

columns, each column being represented by an icon (57, 60) on a display; 
   means for decomposing at least one of said tables into discrete 

column icons; 
   means for displaying said discrete column icons in at least one 

pool area (56); 
   and means responsive to the user selecting column icons from said 

at least one pool area for combining said column icons to form a new 
table (83).
