<ABSTRACT>
A lateral bipolar transistor having an emitter layer (91) and a collector layer (92) on a structured dielectric layer (7) which is located in the layer plane of a base layer (2) and is interrupted by the base layer (2) in such a way that, between the base layer (2) and the components of this structured dielectric layer (7), contact is made with the base layer (2) by the emitter layer (91) and, on the opposite side, by the collector layer (92).

Method for producing a lateral bipolar transistor, 
in which 


in a first step there is applied to a silicon layer (20), 
which is situated on an insulation layer (1) and is 

provided with a doping intended for a base layer (2), a 
highly doped polysilicon layer (3) for a base connection, 

a dielectric layer (4) is applied to the said polysilicon 
layer and the two layers are structured to form a strip-shaped 

portion, 
in a second step inner spacers (5) made of a dielectric 
are produced laterally with respect to the strip-shaped 

portion, which is intended for a base, of these structured 
layers (3, 4), 
in a third step outer spacers (6) are produced laterally 
with respect to these spacers (5) from a dielectric which 

can be selectively etched with respect to the dielectric 
of these inner spacers (5), 
in a fourth step, using the inner spacers (5), the outer 
spacers (6) and the structured dielectric layer (4) as a 

mask, the silicon layer (20) which is situated on the 
insulation layer (1) is completely removed outside the 

region covered by this mask, with the result that a 
silicon layer (2) remains, 
in a fifth step a further dielectric layer (70) is 
applied conformally over the whole area, 
in a sixth step this further dielectric layer (70) is 
etched back in a planarizing manner except for portions 

(7) remaining to the side of the outer spacers (6), 
in a seventh step the outer spacers (6) are selectively  
 

removed, 
in an eighth step, using the applied dielectric layers 
(4, 5) as a mask, the remaining portion of the silicon 

layer (2) in the region of the removed outer spacers (6) 
is removed down to the insulation layer (1), producing 

openings (8) on both sides, 
in a ninth step a highly doped layer (9) intended for the 
emitter and collector is applied over the whole area, 
in a tenth step this layer (9) is etched back in a 
planarizing manner and is structured, with the result 

that an emitter layer (91) and a collector layer (92) are 
produced in a manner separate from one another, and 
in an eleventh step a planarization layer (10) made of a 
dielectric is applied, in which layer contact holes for 

electrical connection are subsequently formed, and an 
emitter contact (11), a collector contact (12) and a base 

contact (13) are subsequently applied. 
Method according to Claim 1, in which 
SiO₂ is used in the first step for the dielectric layer 

(4), in the second step for the inner spacers (5) and in 
the fifth step for the further dielectric layer (70), and 

Si₃N₄ is used in the third step for the outer spacers 
(6). 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which in the 
first step the polysilicon layer (3) is produced with p⁺-conducting 

doping, and
 
in the ninth step the layer (9) is produced, with n⁺-conducting 

doping, from a silicon-containing material.
