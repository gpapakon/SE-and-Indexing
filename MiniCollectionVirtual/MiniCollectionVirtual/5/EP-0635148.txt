<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system for operating a heating element (114) of a ceramic sensor (112) which is fitted in the exhaust gas channel (104) of an internal combustion engine (100) and can be heated by the heating element (114). If the operating mode of the internal combustion engine (100) is such that there could be liquid in its exhaust gas channel (104), the heating element (114) is not operated or is controlled in such a way that the ceramic sensor (112) is run below a critical temperature (TSeK). Above the critical temperature (TSe) there is the danger that the ceramic sensor (112) may be damaged by contact with the liquid.

System for operating a heating element (114) of
a ceramic sensor (112), which is fitted in the exhaust

pipe (104) of an internal combustion engine (100) and
can be heated up by the heating element (114),

characterized by

means which activate the heating element (114) as a
function of the operating state of the internal

combustion engine,
means for establishing a first operating state (phase
I) whenever, when starting the internal combustion

engine (100), the coolant temperature is below a
threshold value (TKM1) or if the temperature (TAbg) of

the exhaust system is below a threshold value (TTau),
means for establishing a second operating state,
which comprises the operating points outside the first

operating state,
and means which do not put the heating element into
operation, or activate the heating element (114) in

such a way that the ceramic sensor (112) is operated
below a critical temperature (TSeK) when the internal

combustion engine is in the first operating state
(phase I).
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the heating element (114) of the ceramic sensor

(112) is operated with reduced power (P2) during the
first operating state (phase I) of the internal

combustion engine (100).
System according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, during the first operating state (phase I) of the 

internal combustion engine (100), the heating element
(114) of the ceramic sensor (112) is operated initially

(subphase Ia) with high power (P1) and subsequently
(subphase Ib) with reduced power (P2), the transition

from high power (P1) to reduced power (P2) taking place
when a selectable time period has elapsed since the

starting of the internal combustion engine (100) or if
it is to be assumed that the temperature (TSe) of the

ceramic sensor (112) has exceeded a threshold value

(TSe1).
System according to Claim 3, characterized in
that it is determined from the temperature-dependent

properties of the ceramic sensor (112) or from the
signal of a temperature sensor in thermal contact with

the ceramic sensor (112) whether the temperature (TSe)
of the ceramic sensor (112) has exceeded the threshold

value (TSe1).
System according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that a transition from the

first operating state (phase I) to the second operating
state (phase II) of the internal combustion engine

(100) takes place when a selectable time period has
elapsed since the beginning of the first operating

state (phase I).
System according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the transition from the

first operating state (phase I) to the second operating
state (phase II) of the internal combustion engine

(100) takes place if it can be assumed that the
temperature (TAbg) of the exhaust system has exceeded a

threshold value (TTau) in the vicinity of the ceramic
sensor (112).
System according to Claim 6, characterized in
that it is determined from the signal of a temperature

sensor which is fitted in the vicinity of the ceramic
sensor or from a model which describes in approximation

the temperature (TAbg) in the vicinity of the ceramic
sensor whether the temperature (TAbg) in the vicinity

of the ceramic sensor (112) has exceeded the threshold 
value (TTau).
System according to Claim 7, characterized in
that in the model the amount of air or mass of air

sucked in since the starting of the internal combustion
engine (110) is integrated and the integral is compared

with a threshold value.
System according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the critical temperature

(TSeK) is selected such that, when the ceramic sensor
(112) is operated below the critical temperature

(TSeK), there is no appreciable risk of damage to the
ceramic sensor (112) on contact with liquid.
System according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the ceramic sensor (112)

is operated during the first operating state (phase I)
of the internal combustion engine (100) in the

temperature range between the threshold value (TSel),
above which the ceramic sensor (112) is at least

conditionally operational, and the critical temperature
(TSeK).
System according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the heating element (114)

of the ceramic sensor (112) can be switched on in
response to an occurrence at a time before the starting

of the internal combustion engine (100).
System according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that the ceramic sensor (112)

is an oxygen probe which is arranged in the exhaust
pipe (104) of the internal combustion engine (100),

before or after a catalytic converter (118), seen in
the direction of flow of the exhaust gases.
