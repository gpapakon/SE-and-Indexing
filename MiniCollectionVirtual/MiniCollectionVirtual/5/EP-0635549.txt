<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to filled 
organosiloxane compositions and to a method for 
preparing the composition. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to organosiloxane 
compositions exhibiting excellent vibration-damping 
properties and to a method for their preparation. Polyorganosiloxane oils, organosiloxane 
compounds, and organosiloxane gels are used as 
vibration-damping elements in optical read-out devices 
such as compact disks and laser disks; in magnetic 
read-out devices such as magnetic disks and "floppy" 
optical disks, referred to hereinafter as "floptical" 
disks; and in engineered equipment such as precision 
measurement devices. The organosiloxane compositions 
used in these applications range in consistency from 
oils to semi-solids and are typically composed of 
polyorganosiloxane oils and one or more fillers. Liquid organosilicon compounds are 
particularly suitable as vibration-damping materials 
because they lack rubbery elasticity and because they 
can dampen external vibrations through internal 
friction within the organosiloxane compound itself as 
well as between the oil and a filler. These compositions are exemplified by blends 
of finely divided inorganic particles with 
polyorganosiloxane oils, also referred to as "silicone 
oils", and are more fully described in by WO-A-8203086 (JP-A 
57-168997) and JP-A 63-308241. Blends of a finely 
divided powdered organic resin with silicone oil is 
also described in JP-A 63-308242. A particular 
disadvantage of these compositions is their inadequate 
vibration-damping properties.  
 The present invention provides organosiloxane 
compositions that have excellent vibration-damping 
properties as compared to the foregoing prior art. The disadvantages of the prior art for resin-filled, 
vibration-damping compositions are overcome by 
using as the filler finely divided hollow particles of 
a thermoplastic organic resin (containing a blowing 
agent) as the filler. These particles are obtained by 
heating resin particles containing a blowing agent in 
the presence of a polyorganosiloxane oil, thereby 
irreversibly expanding the resin particles. The present invention introduces 
organosiloxane compositions comprising 
(A) from 70 to 99.9 weight percent of a 
polyorganosiloxane oil, (B) from 0.1 to 10 weight percent of finely divided 
hollow particles of a thermoplastic organic resin, having a particle size of 5 to 500 µm 
and optionally (C) from 0 to 20 weight percent of a thickener. The present invention also provides a method 
for
