<ABSTRACT>
A container for containing miscellaneous products, of the type in 
which a base (11) and a lid (13) are hinged together and provided, 

at a point opposite the hinging point, with a snap-closure system 
consisting of a retention tooth (22) provided on the lid (13) for 

snap-engaging in a seat (23) provided in the base (11). According 
to the invention, with said base (11) there is associated an 

elastically yieldable intermediate element (12) in which said seat 
(23) for the retention tooth (22) is provided, said element (12) 

being movable relative to the base (11) along a first axis a-a 
joining the hinging system to the snap-closure system, by applying 

two opposing forces to the element (12) along a second axis b-b 
intersecting the first axis a-a, resulting in release of the 

retention tooth (22) from its engagement with the seat (23).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plastics container for containing 
miscellaneous products, such as cosmetics, beauty and 
parapharmaceutical products, of the type comprising a base and a 
lid hinged together and provided with a snap-closure system at a 
point diametrically opposite the hinging point. Containers of this type can be opened by a presser element which, 
when pressed, disengages a tooth provided on the lid from a 
suitable seat provided in the base, so as to be able to open the 
lid and gain access to the contents. The construction of closure systems of the aforesaid type is 
relatively costly in that to form the base presser element which 
cooperates with the lid retention tooth, complicated moulds are 
required together with additional components such as the presser 
element itself, which in addition is visible from the outside, 
sometimes to the detriment of overall appearance. Alternatively, it is also known to open the container simply by 
disengaging the retention tooth from its seat by exerting 
sufficient separation force between the base and lid. However such closure systems are uncertain in that the snap-engagement 
of the tooth in its seat must be such as to enable the  
 
container to be closed and then opened utilizing the elasticity of 
the material, without the application of excessive force by the 
user. In addition such arrangements are not always aesthetic, requiring 
the presence of recesses and/or projections on the base and lid at 
which to apply the opening force by the fingers of the hand. The general object of the present invention is to obviate the 
drawbacks of the known art by means of a container provided with a 
closure system which combines the operational reliability of those 
comprising a presser element for positively disengaging the 
retention tooth from its seat, with the structural simplicity of 
those provided simply with a retention tooth on the lid, to be 
snap-engaged in an undercut seat provided in the base. A further object of the invention is to provide an invisible 
closure system, so as not to negatively influence the overall 
appearance of the container. Said objects are attained by a container incorporating the 
characteristics defined in the accompanying claims. In the 
drawings, which are to an enlarged scale: 
Figure 1 is a side elevation showing a container according to the 
invention in its closed state; Figure 2 is an exploded view in longitudinal section showing the 
three constituent elements (base, intermediate ring, lid) of the 
container

<CLAIMS>
A container for containing miscellaneous products, in 
which a base (11) and a lid (13) are hinged together and provided, 

at a point diametrically opposite the hinging point, with a snap-closure 
system consisting of a retention tooth (22) provided on 

the lid (13) for snap-engaging in a seat (23) provided in the base 
(11), characterised in that with said base (11) there is 

associated an elastically yieldable intermediate element (12) in 
which said seat (23) for the retention tooth (22) is provided, 

said element (12) being movable relative to the base (11) along a 
first axis a-a joining the hinging system to the snap-closure 

system, by applying two opposing forces to the element (12) along 
a second axis b-b intersecting the first axis a-a, resulting in 

release of the retention tooth (22) from its engagement with the 
seat (23). 
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
said element (12) comprises a conical inner wall (27) with which a 

rounded perimetral edge (28) of said lid (13) cooperates. 
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
between said base (11) and said element (12) there are provided 

snap-engagement means (17, 18) in correspondence with the hinging 
system, and snap-engagement means (15, 16) in correspondence with 

the seat (23), with said means (15, 16) there cooperating 
respective retention and guide shoulders (20, 21). 
A container as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
sa
id base (11), said intermediate element (12) and said lid (13) 
are generally of flat circular shape.
