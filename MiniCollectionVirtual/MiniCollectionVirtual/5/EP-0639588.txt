<CLAIMS>
Process for preparing weakly-basic anion exchangers
based on crosslinked vinylaromatic polymers containing

ring-bonded primary aminomethyl groups by reaction
of (i) crosslinked vinylaromatic polymers

containing ring-bonded phthalimidomethyl groups with
(ii) methylamine at elevated temperature under

pressure.
Process according to Claim 1, wherein at least 2 mol
of methylamine are reacted per mol of phthalimidomethyl

groups.
Process according to Claim 1, at temperatures of
from 110 to 150°C.
Process according to Claim 1, at pressures of from
10 to 100 bar.
Process for preparing N-chloromethylphthalimide by
chlorination of N-methylphthalimide with chlorine in

the presence of free-radical formers at elevated
temperature.
Process according to Claim 5, at temperatures of
from 45 to 180°C.
Process for preparing weakly-basic anion exchangers 
based on crosslinked vinylaromatic polymers

containing ring-bonded primary aminomethyl groups,
wherein


a) crosslinked vinylaromatic polymer is reacted
with N-chloromethylphthalimide,
b) the reaction product obtained is cleaved by the
process according to Claim 1 into anion

exchangers and N,N'-dimethylphthalamide,
c) the N,N'-dimethylphthalamide obtained is
cyclized to N-methylphthalimide and
d) this is chlorinated by the process according to
Claim 5.
Use of the process according to Claims 1 and 7 for
the preparation of anion exchangers containing

secondary or tertiary aminomethyl groups and/or
quaternary ammonium groups.
