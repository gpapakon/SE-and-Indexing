<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for rotating a base carrying heavy matter, 
which can actuates automatically a rotation table for 

rotating a base on which a person or the like is placed 
slowly at a desired angle. 
A rotation device 20 having a cylindrical stator 23 is 
installed on a rectangular frame 21. Twelve iron cores 23b 

are arranged inwardly at equal intervals inside a 
circumference of the iron core 23a of the cylindrical stator 

23. A Coil 23c is wound on each iron core 23b to be formed 
into an electromagnet M. A disc-shaped rotor 24 is 

provided inside the stator wherein eight permanent magnets 
24a are arranged at specific intervals on the periphery so 

as to alternate N pole and S pole. A rotation axis 25 is 
set up in center of the rotor. The rotation axis is 

supported to an upper plate 27 and a bottom plate 28 by 
bearings 27a and 28a rotatably. A base carrying heavy 

matter is fixed on the upper end of the rotation axis 
horizontally. The base can be rotated at a desired angle 

by delivering electric current to electromagnets by power 
supply/control device 40.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an apparatus for 
rotating a base on which heavy matter is carried, for 
example, an apparatus for rotating a base on which a bed 
for nursing a person is mounted through a certain angle at a 
low speed. Heretofore, operations such as raising or rotating the 
upper half and the like of a person to be cared for on a bed 
placed on a base carrying heavy matter (hereinafter referred 
to sometimes as the base) have been conducted mainly by man 
power. However, there was a problem because it was difficult 
for a person of little strength or a child to conduct such 
operations. For this reason, a method for driving the base carrying 
heavy matter by an electrical motor is proposed. In this 
case, since the base must be moved at a low speed to prevent 
an impact on a person or matter placed thereon, a number of 
revolution of the electrical motor is converted into a low 
number, which is transmitted to the base by installing a gear 
or a sprocket on a rotation axis for the electric motor and 
the base. Besides, a torque to the base is increased by 
lowering the number of rotation.  However, in case of the above apparatus for driving a 
base carrying heavy matter, there is a problem of cost 
increase because the apparatus becomes large-size and 
complicated by necessity for intervention of a deceleration 
gear and the like. There is another problem of difficulty of 
man-power operation without electric power because a load is 
generated on the plate in proportion to the gear ratio. 
Further, if a clutch is added to avoid such a problem, there 
causes a problem of cost increase again here because the 
apparatus becomes larger and more complicated. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to 
solve the above problems by providing an apparatus for 
rotating a base carrying heavy matter in a simple structure 
which enables an automatic operation. The 
invention provides an apparatus for rotating a base on 
which heavy matter is carried, comprising a rotation axis 
rotatably supported by a housing, a disc rotor or a circular 
arc rotor fixed vertically to an axial direction of the 
rotation axis wherein plural magnets are positioned at 
specific intervals each other around its periphery so as to 
alternate polarities, a stator having plural electromagnets 
fixed on the housing so as to face the magnet around the rotor  
 
or in an upper/lower relationship with the rotor, means for 
supplying and controlling electric power to the 
electromagnets, and a rotation actuating
