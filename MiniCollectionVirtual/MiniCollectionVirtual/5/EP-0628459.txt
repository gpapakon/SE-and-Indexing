<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an emergency pressure reserve for a motor vehicle rear brake, as well as to a pressure accumulator for realising the abovementioned reserve. This reserve is characterised in that it includes a pressure accumulator (A) comprising a body of substantially cylindrical shape (1) in which a piston (2) is mounted so that it can move in translation dividing the said body (1) into a first chamber (3) communicating with the braking circuit (C) and a second chamber (4) in which elastic means (M) are provided urging the piston (2) towards the first chamber (3). This invention is applicable particularly to the realisation of an emergency reserve for motor vehicle rear brakes.

Hydraulic hydropneumatic suspension and braking circuit in which the
suspension liquid controls the brakes, comprising a main accumulator

(17) connected downstream of a safety valve (18), which itself is
connected by a brake metering distributor (19) to a front braking circuit

(21) and a rear braking circuit (37) or a diagonally braking circuit, the
said safety valve (18) serving to isolate, in case of failure, the braking

circuits from each other, one (37) of the braking circuits comprising
downstream of the safety valve and upstream of the brake metering

distributor a duct (38) connecting the suspension spheres (35, 36) to the
brake metering distributor, characterized in that the said duct (38) is

provided with a safety pressure supply storage (R) comprising a body
(1) in which a piston (2) is mounted for movement in translation by

dividing the said body (1) into a first chamber (3) communicating with
the said duct (38) and a second chamber (4) in which are provided

elastic means (M) urging the piston (2) towards the first chamber (3)
with a predetermined pressure, the said predetermined pressure being

adjusted so that the residual pressure in the associated braking circuit
(37) be above or equal to a given value always ensuring some braking

when the piston (2) is in expansion abutment.
Circuit according to claim 1, characterized in that the elastic means are
predetermined so that the piston (2) be in a drive abutment for a pressure

in the circuit lower than the suspension pressure during the run of the
vehicle.
Circuit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the elastic means
(M) are mechanical means.
Circuit according to claim 3, characterized in that the elastic means

comprise a spring (6) or the like acting upon the piston (2). 
Circuit according to claim 4, characterized in that it comprises in the
second chamber (4) a bell-shaped member (7) comprising at its base a

collar (8) upon which the aforesaid spring (6) is bearing and fastened
with its upper portion to a rod (9) acting upon the aforesaid piston (2).
Circuit according to any one of claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the
aforesaid second chamber (4) communicates with a protected enclosed

space (10) which permits the volume variations of the second chamber
generated by the movement of the piston (2).
Circuit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the elastic means
(M) are pneumatic means.
Circuit according to claim 7, characterized in that the aforesaid
pneumatic means comprise a mass of gas under pressure enclosed

within the second chamber (4).
Circuit according to any one of the foregoing claims, characterized in
that it comprises means (N) for the lubrication of the piston (2).
Circuit according to claim 9, characterized in that the aforesaid
lubricating means comprise an oil supply (11) limited by two chamfers

(12) and (13) provided on the body (1) and the piston (2), respectively.
Circuit according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that
the aforesaid second chamber (4) comprises a portion of annular shape

(5) surrounding the said body of substantially cylindrical shape (1).
Circuit according to one of the foregoing claims, characterized in that
the duct (38) is connected upstream of the safety pressure supply storage

(R) to an anti-sagging valve (27) interposed between the safety valve
(18) and the aforesaid suspension spheres (35, 36). 
Automotive vehicle fitted with a circuit according to one of the
foregoing claims.
