<ABSTRACT>
The phase noise characteristic of a microwave oscillator comprising a cavity (2) excited by an active element (1) is improved by introducing a frequency discriminator embodied by using the same oscillator cavity. The waves transmitted and reflected by the cavity (2) are measured, combined and detected by a pair of low noise diodes (7, 8) and the signals obtained are compared to produce a control signal for a phase shifter (10) placed between the active device (1) and the cavity (2). The oscillator is preferably of the type with dielectric resonator.

<DESCRIPTION>
"Microwave oscillator with improved phase noise characteristic"* * * * *DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a microwave oscillator with improved phase noise characteristic near the carrier.The invention has its preferred but nonlimiting application in telecommunications systems and in particular in digital radio link systems with low and medium capacity and therefore is illustrated and described in detail below with reference to this application but its employment is not to be understood as limited to that illustrated.In low and medium capacity radio link systems it is constantly required to reduce the spectrum occupation even if this involves the use of more complicated modulation schemes.It has been found that a low phase noise microwave synthesiser is fundamental for this reduction and to this end the optimal solution is multiloop microwave frequency synthesis.But the circuitry complexity of a multiloop synthesiser is considerable because of the devices employed and among which are in particular frequency dividers, sampling phase detectors, phase comparators, crystal oscillators, etc.The purpose of the present invention is to overcome the shortcomings and limitations of the known art illustrated and in particular to provide a microwave oscillator comprising an active device and a resonant cavity with reduced phase noise near the carrier, simple in construction and highly stable to temperature, mechanical shocks and vibrations.These purposes are achieved in accordance with the present invention by a microwave oscillator comprising an active device and a resonating cavity and characterised in that it comprises a discriminator or frequency demodulator, using the said resonator cavity and measuring the power transmitted and the power reflected in the cavity; means for comparing the reflected and transmitted powers, connected at the output of the discriminator; and means for modifying the phase of the active device in response to the signal produced by the comparison means.The oscillator is preferably of the type with dielectric resonator. 

 In accordance with the present invention there is provided a feedback of the noise produced by the active device previously extracted by a frequency discriminator for the purpose of reducing the oscillator phase noise near the carrier. The characteristic of the oscillator is thus independent of the active device and depends only on the dielectric resonator with high Q and on the 1/f-type low noise of the diodes present in the discriminator.Additional
