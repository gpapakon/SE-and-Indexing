<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 3 (S)-METHYLHEPTANOIC ACID AND INTERMEDIATES THEREFOR • *Background of the Invention The present invention is directed to a process and intermediates for the manufacture of 3(S)-methylheptanoic acid of the absolute stereochemical formula (I)(I) which is a useful intermediate for the preparation of immunoregulatory agents of the formula (II)(II) wherein R4 and R5 are each hydrogen or one of R4 and R5 is hydrogen and the other is (C,-C6)alkyl or (C6-C8)cycloalkylmethyl as described in copending, commonly owned United States Patent Applications Serial Nos. 07/346,118, filed February 21 , 1989 and 07/341 ,350 filed February 21 , 1989, which are herein incorporated by reference.A procedure used to prepare 3(S)-methylheptanoic acid is described by U.S. Serial No. 07/341 ,350 as shown below.

TBDMS 
U. S. Serial No. 07/346,118 describes the synthesis of S-3-alkylheptanoic acids from a trans-4-alken-3-ol of the formula (III)(I") 

wherein R is methyl or ethyl which is converted to a compound of the formula (IV)(IV) by the action of t-butyl hydroperoxide, in a reaction inert solvent in the presence of titanium tetraisopropoxide and L-(+)-diisopropyl tartrate, in an amount sufficient to oxidize the S-enantiomer and in a second step, the product of the above reaction is stereospecifically condensed with a trif^^J-alkyljorthoacetate and, without isolation, the intermediate allyl-enol ether rearranged, in the presence of an acid in a reaction inert solvent, to yield a (CT-CaJalkyl 3(R)-alkyl-4-hepenoate of the absolute stereochemical formula (V)0H(V) which may be hydrogenated to the desired S-3-alkylheptanoic acid.Optically pure 3(S)-methylheptanoic acid (I) has been prepared from the corresponding racemate in unspecified yield by multiple (eight) crystallizations of the quinine salt at an inconveniently low temperature of -15°C. [Levene et al., J. Biol. Chem. 95, pp. 1-24, 1932, at page 18, there called 2-n-butylbutyric acid-4]. Optically active 3-methylheptanoic acid has subsequently been produced by a number of other methods (Soai et al., J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun. 1985, pp. 496-470; Oppolzer et al., Helv. Chim. Acta. 68, pp. 212-215 (1985); Ohno et al., U.S. Patent 4,564,620 (1986); Mori et al., Synthesis 1982, pp. 752-753; Oppolzer et al., Helva. Chim. Acta. 64, pp.
