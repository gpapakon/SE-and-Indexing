<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bubble gum
formulation having improved, longer lasting sweetness
and flavor.Chewing gums typically known in the art
contain many ingredients, including sweeteners and
flavor ingredients. It is often desirable to produce a
chewing gum having a high degree of sweetness and
flavor. However, one of the limitations of chewing gum
is that the sweetness and flavor are rapidly lost
during chewing. This is especially true of bubble gums
and other "fast release" chewing gums which release
their sweetness and flavor compounds rapidly, creating
an initial burst of high intensity sweetness and flavor
which is initially pleasing to the consumer but which
dissipates quickly during chewing."Slow release" chewing gums, on the other
hand, release their sweetness and flavor over a longer
period of time but do not provide an initial burst of
high intensity sweetness and flavor. Thus, the
consumer who desires a high initial sweetness and
flavor impact must often sacrifice the enjoyment of
long lasting sweetness and flavor. The consumer who
desires a chewing gum having a longer lasting sweetness
and flavor must often forego the enjoyment of an 
initially high sweetness and flavor impact. Chewing
gum manufacturers are constantly trying to extend the
time in which consumers can enjoy the sweetness and
flavor of chewing gum without sacrificing the quality
of the initial sweetness and flavor impact.The use of fruit flavors in chewing gum has
become very common, especially in bubble gum. Fruit
flavors typically contain a combination of fruit esters
and may contain orange oil, lemon oil or other natural
oils. Fruit flavors used in chewing gum include, but
are not limited to, banana, cherry, apple, pineapple,
grape, strawberry and blends including commonly known
tutti frutti and other bubble gum flavors.Fruit esters tend to release from chewing gum
very quickly causing the chewing gum to have a
relatively short flavor duration. Also, fruit esters
typically have a light flavor quality, causing the
chewing gum to have a low flavor impact. The use of
fruit oils such as orange and lemon oil, or certain
other flavor oils such as clove oil and oil of
wintergreen, tends to increase the duration and impact
of the fruit flavors to some extent. However, there is
still a need or desire in the chewing gum industry for
techniques which further enhance the impact and
duration of the sweetness and flavor of bubble gum and
other fruit flavored chewing gums.Aspartame, also known as
