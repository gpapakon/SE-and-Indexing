<ABSTRACT>
The method according to the invention consists in a) adding to the medium to be analyzed a compound of formula (I), A and C, which are the same or different, are each H, ( alpha ) or ( beta ) but not together H; and B= ( psi ), ( delta ), ( epsilon ), ( phi ), ( gamma ), ( eta ), ( iota , ( xi ) or ( kappa ); b) acidifying the medium, either with the aid of a strong carboxylic or sulfonic acid or perchloric acid, or with hydrochloric, hydrobromic or sulfuric acid; c) incubating the acidified medium between 25 and 60  DEG C to obtain a stable coloration; d) measuring the absorbency of the coloured medium at the absorption wavelength which is specific to the chromophoric additive formed and using the value of this measurement to determine the total concentration of 4-hydroxy-2-enaldehydes and MDA, or malonic dialdehyde only, according to the acid used. Application in the analysis of the indexes of lipid peroxidation, especially in clinical research.

organic or inorganic acids:

it being understood that:

alkyl is a linear or branched group comprising 1 to 6 C; and
aralkyl substituted on the aryl ring denotes that said ring is substituted by one or
more identical or different groups selected from alkyl (1 to 6 C), alkoxy (1 to 6

b) acidifying the medium to which this reagent has been added, either with an acid
selected from the group comprising strong carboxylic acids, strong sulfonic acids

and perchloric acid, or with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulfuric acid;
c) incubating the medium acidified in this way, at a temperature between 25 and
60Â°C, for a sufficient time to obtain a stable coloration due to the formation of a

chromophoric addition product of the reagent with all the enaldehydes, as defined
above, present in the medium, or with malonic dialdehyde by itself, depending on

the nature of the acid used; and
d) measuring the absorbance of the coloured medium at the absorption wavelength
which is specific for the chromophoric addition product of the reagent used, and

using this to determine the concentration of enaldehydes, as defined above, or of
malonic dialdehyde by itself, depending on the particular case.

conditions as the analysis to be performed, the difference in the absorbance A for a
given concentration and the absorbance A

absorbances being read at the maximum absorption wavelength characteristic of the
addition product between the enaldehydes, as defined above, and the compound of

general formula I used.
Method according to Claim 5, characterized in that the concentration of
enaldehyde(s) to be analyzed is determined from the measurement of the absorbance

A of the sample and the absorbance A

slope of the calibration line, where:

[concentration of enaldehyde(s)] = (A - A
