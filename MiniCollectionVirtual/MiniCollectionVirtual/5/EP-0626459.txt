<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an corrosion resistant
copper alloy tube which is used as a refrigerant copper
alloy tube or a heat exchanger copper alloy tube and a
fin-tube heat exchanger which is used for an
air-conditioner, particularly relates to an corrosion
resistant copper tube and a fin-tube heat exchanger having
improved corrosion resistant property against an ant-nest
type corrosion.A tube which was made of copper deoxidized by
phosphorous has been widely used for the conventional
refrigerant tube or the conventional heat exchanger tube
generally due to its better bending and brazing properties.In these tubes, however, organic materials such as
lubricant oil or process oil and organic solvents
unavoidably remaining on the surface of the fins and tubes
after the tubing and fabrication processes may decompose
during the repeated deposit and evaporation of water due to
a coolant and during the exposure to peculiar
temperature/moisture and air-exchange environment created as
a nature of its construction to form carbonic acids which
cause peculiar corrosion showing local ant-nest type
corrosion on the surface of the tube.Thus, a large amount of lubricant oil has been used in
the fabrication process of the heat exchanger, however
considering recent environmental problems there is a trend
to avoid the degreasing wash by organic solvents and rather
to use volatile lubricant oil instead of such organic
solvents. In this case, even though the base oil itself is
volatile, such lubricant oil still contains some oil
additives which may remain on the surface of the copper
tube. Therefore, there is an increasing risk for the ant-nest
type corrosion in future according to more usage of volatile
lubricant oil, compared to the case the degrease wash was
performed using organic solvents. Reflecting such
circumstance, measurements for the ant-nest type corrosion
are attracting the attention of the industry as one of
serious problems. Further, increase of remaining organic
materials on the surface of the copper alloy tube is
creating another problem of poor conjunction of tube during
the brazing which is used as a major method for the tube
connection. Therefore, development of a copper alloy tube
having superior corrosion resistant and brazing properties
than the conventional phosphorous deoxidized copper tube is
desired as a tube material for the refrigerant tube or the
heat exchanger tube.Further, the fin-tube heat exchanger used for an
air-conditioner is generally fabricated using aluminum or
aluminum alloy
