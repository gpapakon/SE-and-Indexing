<ABSTRACT>
The object was to develop a process for the bonding of polyphenylene ether moulding compositions, in which the areas to be bonded must not necessarily be pretreated and in which there is no environmental pollution, blistering or stress cracking caused by volatile solvent residues. This object is achieved by a process in which an adhesive composition is used which comprises the following components:     a) from 0.1 to 75 parts by weight of a mixture of     I. from 20 to 100% by weight of a polyphenylene ether and   II. from 0 to 80% by weight of polystyrene;   b) from 25 to 99.9 parts by weight of a plasticiser and, based in each case on 100 parts by weight of component a), c) from 0 to 25 parts by weight of an impact-modifying component and   d) from 0 to 50 parts by weight of fillers and/or reinforcing agents, pigments, organic dyes, antistatic agents, stabilisers and processing auxiliaries.   By this process, bonding sites of high strength are obtained with all commercially available moulding compositions based on polyphenylene ether.
