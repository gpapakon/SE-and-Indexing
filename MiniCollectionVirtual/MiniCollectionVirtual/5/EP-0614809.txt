<ABSTRACT>
An assembly and method provide a continuous 
supply of packaging film (14) to a form, fill and seal 

packaging machine (M) with two spindles (20, 24) 
alternately operating as the active spindle (20) to 

feed the film (14) from one roll at a time. Opposed 
pneumatic manifolds (32, 34) are operative to splice 

the tail-end (E₁) of the film (14) from the active roll 
(12) to the head-end (E₂) of the film (18) from the 

standby roll (16). The opposed manifolds (32, 34) 
pivot in opposite directions away from the machine (M) 

to provide easy access for loading. A programmable 
controller (48) controls the splicing operation. 

Valves (44) operated by the controller (48) connect a 
vacuum source (35) to one of the manifolds (32, 34) to 

hold the head-end (E₂) at a splicing station (11) and 
to the other to maintain tension on the active film 

(14) after the tail-end (E₁) leaves the spindle (20). 
An end-of-roll detector (45) near the spindle (20) 

triggers the tensioning function. The width of the 
manifold (32, 34) is adjustable to accommodate 

different width film (14). A photocell detector (80, 
100) and encoder (85) in the circuit (C) allow tracking 

of the tail-end (E₁). When it arrives at the splicing 
station (11), the appropriate control valve (44) 

rapidly switches to apply an air blast generated by 
positive pneumatic pressure to blow the tail-end/head-end 

(E₁, E₂) together so that adhesive tape (T) pre-applied 
to the head-end (E₁) is securely attached to 

the tail-end (E₁) to complete the splicing operation. 
The programmable controller (48) continues to track the 

splice through the packaging machine (M) to initiate a 
dry cycle and removal of the splice section.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to feeding film 
into a form, fill and seal packaging machine and, more 
particularly, to continuous film feeding that 
eliminates interruptions associated with loading a new 
supply roll of film. Assemblies and methods for unwinding and 
feeding of packaging film into a form, fill and seal 
packaging machine are known in the art. A number of 
other machines that process web material similar to 
film, such as printing presses, employ similar feeding 
assemblies and methods. These feeding assemblies 
typically include means for supporting and unwinding a 
supply web roll and means for feeding the web into the 
processing machine. In the case of a form, fill and seal 
packaging machine, the film is ultimately formed into 
an open package, filled with a product, and sealed to 
retain the product until opened for use. A wide 
variety of products, most notably food items, are 
packaged in this manner. To further explain, the basic 
combination of a form, fill and seal packaging machine 
is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,727,707, assigned to the 
assignee of the present invention. It discloses a 
method and assembly for controlling the feed of  
 
packaging film from a supply roll over a former, where 
the film is formed into an open tube. A filling means 
provides a measured amount of product into the bottom 
of the tube where a package or bag is being formed. 
The package is then sealed across the top to yield a 
filled, hermetically sealed package with the product on 
the inside (see Figures 2-4). The '707 patent actually 
covers a particular improved control routine for film 
registration utilizing registration marks detected by a 
photoelectric cell and triggering the various form, 
fill and seal operations. It is desirable to minimize the down-time of 
the packaging machine so that a maximum number of 
packages or bags can be produced during each unit time. 
This necessarily means that not only is a reliable high 
speed package forming, filling and sealing operation 
required, but also a reliable high speed film 
feeding/registration arrangement is a necessity, as 
illustrated in the '707 patent. In prior art assemblies, film is typically 
supplied for feeding along the feed path into a form, 
fill and seal portion of the machine by loading or 
installing a roll of the film on a spindle or web roll 
cradle, and controllably rotating the roll to unwind 
the film. A significant disadvantage of these prior 
art packaging film unwinding arrangements is the lost 
operating time
