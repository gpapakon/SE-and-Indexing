<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic bearing which is precisely controllable 
of the rotor's (11) position with simple structure without 

a position sensor. This magnetic bearing comprises: a 
multiple number of the hysteresis amplifiers (13) for supplying 

excitation current to a multiple number of electromagnets (12) for 
the levitation of a rotor (11), a loop filter (15) for supplying 

the output after transforming to direct current; of a phase 
comparator (14) for detecting the phase difference of switching 

wave at the hysteresis amplifier; a frequency voltage converter for 
obtaining voltage signal which is proportional to the 

switching frequency at the hysteresis amplifier; an adder 
for obtaining the difference of the voltage signal; and 

control circuit for controlling the hysteresis amplifier (13) 
stabilized with the difference above. Like this above, the 

magnetic levitation system is totally stabilized, simultaneously 
using frequency-voltage servo system in the phase-locked-loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic bearing of
which a rotor is floating through the control of magnetic
force of an electromagnet in that the levitating position
of it can be at a constant position through the detection
and control of the levitating position thereof.Recently a magnetic levitation system with no
contact is used as a conveyor system which is utilized
in clean environments, such as IC manufacturing
equipment. This kind of magnetic levitation apparatus, uses
a magnetic bearing wherein its rotor is a floating
body which is levitating due to the magnetic force of an electromagnet,
and by way of detecting of the levitating
position of the rotor, it is controlled to keep its constant
position.Fig. 17 shows a block diagram of the configuration
of a magnetic bearing in the prior art. This magnetic
bearing has two electromagnets 42a, 42b and two position
sensors 43a, 43b which are facing each other through the
rotor 41, and has a bridge circuit 44 into which the
detecting signal of the position sensor 43a, 43b is input,
a comparator 46 which compares the output signal from the
bridge circuit 44 with the standard signal 45, a signal
processing circuit 47 which treats signals, for example, to
adjust the phase of the output signal from the comparator
46, etc., and an amplifier circuits 48a, 48b which amplify the
output signal from the signal processing circuit 47 and
then send the product thereof to the electromagnets 42a, 
42b.In this magnetic bearing, the rotor 41 is kept in
a floating position due to the magnetic force of the electromagnets
42a, 42b. The position of the rotor 41 is detected
by the position sensors 43a, 43b, and by way of the bridge
circuit 44, the signal which is corresponding to the
rotor's position 41 is output to the comparator 46 which
compares the output signal from the bridge circuit 44 with
the standard signal 45 and obtains a signal which is
corresponding to the deviation from the standard position.
This signal is sent to the amplifier circuits 48a, 48b
after the signal is processed by the signal processing
circuit 47. The amplifier circuits 48a, 48b supply the
exciting current to the electromagnets 42a, 42b. Like this
above, the rotor 41 is controlled to keep a predetermined
constant position.Although the magnetic bearing detects the rotor's
position with the usage of the position sensor, it is
technologically difficult to detect precisely its position
with the position sensor and an expensive high precision
sensor is necessary for the purpose of controlling the
rotor's
