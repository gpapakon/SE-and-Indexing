<ABSTRACT>
Synergistic compositions for inhibiting microbial growth contain synergistic mixtures including 2-(2-bromo-2-nitroethenyl)furan (''BNEF'') and a compound selected from the group consisting of beta-nitrostyrene (''NS''), beta-bromo-beta-nitrostyrene (''BNS''), methylchloro/isothiazolone (''IZN''), methylenebisthiocyanate (''MBT''), 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (''DBNPA''), 2-bromo-2-bromomethyl-glutaronitrile (''BBMGN''), alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (''ADBAC''), and beta-nitrovinyl furan (''NVF''). The synergistic compositions are effective against a wide spectrum of bacteria, algae and fungi. An antimicrobial composition comprising the synergistic mixture and a carrier is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of inhibiting the growth
of microorganism and more particularly to such a method involving
use of synergistic mixtures of
2-(2-bromo-2-nitroethenyl)furan ("BNEF") and certain other
biocides.The use of antimicrobial agents to eliminate or control
the growth of various microorganisms is widely known. For
example, it is known to use antimicrobial agents to control
the growth of microorganisms in a variety of industrial
processes, including those relating to the paint, pulp,
paper, oil, rubber and tobacco industries; to use
antimicrobials in commercial settings, particularly to
disinfect contaminated surfaces; and to include antimicrobial
agents in a wide variety of household goods such as foods,
cosmetics and toiletries.To accommodate such needs, a variety of antimicrobial
agents are known. However, despite the many commercially
available antimicrobials, no single agent is entirely
suitable for every application. Problems with efficacy,
safety, environmental acceptability and cost make certain
antimicrobials more or less suitable for a particular
application.Certain advantages of using a combination of
antimicrobial agents in a single application are known in the 
art. For example, it is known that a combination of agents
may provide an antimicrobial which is effective against a
broader spectrum of microbes than are controlled by a single
agent alone. This broad spectrum coverage is especially
useful in industrial applications where a diversity of
microorganisms is frequently encountered.It is also known that using a combination of
antimicrobials can make the agents more effective when the
antimicrobial composition is to be used over an extended
course of treatment. One reason for this increased
effectiveness is that a combination of antimicrobials is less
susceptible to having the targeted microbes develop a
resistance to the antimicrobial agent because microorganisms
cannot readily adapt to more than one active ingredient at a
time.Moreover, using a combination of agents enables one to
take advantage of antimicrobials which have different, yet
complementary, physiochemical properties.In light of this background, there is a continuing need
for unique antimicrobial compositions comprising combinations
of antimicrobial agents. The present invention addresses
this need. According to the first aspect of the present invention there is provided a
method of inhibiting the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa comprising contacting
said Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an effective
