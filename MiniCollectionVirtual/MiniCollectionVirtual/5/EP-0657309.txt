<ABSTRACT>
A decorative or functional transfer carrying a pattern, particularly for 
decorating ceramics, is produced by printing the pattern in adhesive or a precursor 

thereof on transfer paper by an electronically controlled printing process so that the 
pattern corresponds to an electronically stored or generated digital
 image, in the case 
of a precursor converting it to the adhesive, and applying to the adhesive or 

precursor thereof decorative or functional material in finely divided form, such that 
the material is stuck by the adhesive and hence forms the pattern in the material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method of producing a decorative transfer 
or functional transfer and its use for forming a decorative or functional pattern on 
an article. There is a considerable production of transfers, sometimes called 
"decals" or "decalcomania", which are used particularly for the decoration of 
substrates such as ceramic tableware, glass or glass ceramics, ceramic sanitary ware, 
tiles, vitreous enamels such as enamelled iron, aluminium or steel, and other ceramic 
ware including "giftware" (vases, gift items etc). Such transfers are generally 
produced by screen printing inks containing ceramic colours onto a transfer paper 
which may be a traditional water-slide paper or a wax-coated paper for heat release  
 
transfers. The transfer is employed to transfer its pattern to a substrate article which 
is then fired in a kiln to produce the desired decorated article. The transfers are 
sometimes used without firing to decorate articles which are not able to resist firing 
at several hundred degrees C, such as plastics or wax candles. There is some 
production of transfers by lithography, although this is relatively small scale and is 
particularly time-consuming. The use of an ink-jet printer to print an adhesive ink onto a substrate 
for electronic circuits, applying a low-melting metal powder and heating the pattern 
to form conductive traces for circuit manufacture, has been proposed in EP 414,363. There remains a need for improved transfer production technology, 
especially for patterns to be reproduced onto a transfer paper from a computer 
memory carrying a scanned image, a computer graphics created image or a computer 
modified image. The present invention provides a method of producing a decorative 
or functional transfer bearing a pattern, which method comprises printing the pattern 
in adhesive or a precursor thereof on transfer paper by an electronically controlled 
printing process so that the pattern corresponds to an electronically stored or 
generated digital image, in the case of a precursor converting it to the adhesive, and 
applying to the adhesive or precursor thereof decorative colouring, or functional, 
material in finely divided form, such that the material is stuck by the adhesive and 
hence forms the pattern in the material.  The invention also provides a transfer carrying a pattern of decorative 
or functional material stuck to transfer paper by adhesive, the adhesive or a precursor 
thereof having been printed in that pattern on the transfer paper by an

A method of producing a decorative or functional transfer carrying a 
pattern, which method comprises printing the pattern in adhesive or a precursor 

thereof on transfer paper by an electronically controlled printing process so that the 
pattern corresponds to an electronically stored or generated digital image, in the case 

of a precursor converting it to the adhesive, and applying to the adhesive or 
precursor thereof decorative or functional material in finely divided form, such that 

the material is stuck by the adhesive and hence forms the pattern in the material. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the pattern is printed in 
adhesive and the decorative or functional material in finely divided form is applied 

thereto. 
A method according to claim 2 wherein a tacky layer of the adhesive 
of from 1 to 30 microns thick is printed. 
A method according to any one of claims 1-3 wherein the printing is 
ink-jet printing. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein a 
decorative transfer is produced and the material is decorative colouring material in 

powder or flake form. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
transfer is decorative and the decorative or functional material is one or more of 

ceramic colours, precious metal powders and/or flakes and iridescent or micaceous-type 
pigments. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims wherein the 
transfer is decorative and the decorative or functional material is a ceramic colour 

comprising colour pigment and a flux in a weight ratio of from 0.1-9 parts of flux 
to 1 part of pigment. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims whose steps 
are repeated with a different such decorative or functional material to build up a 

multi-colour or complex effect transfer. 
A transfer carrying a pattern of decorative or functional material stuck 
to transfer paper by adhesive, the adhesive or a precursor thereof having been printed 

in that pattern on the transfer paper by an electronically controlled printing process 
so that the pattern corresponds to an electronically stored or generated digital image. 
A transfer according to claim 9 wherein the adhesive has been printed 
in the pattern. 
A transfer according to claim 9 or 10 which is decorative and wherein 
the decorative or functional material is decorative colouring material in powder or 

flake form. 
A transfer according to any one claims 9-11 which is decorative and 
wherein the decorative or functional material is one or more of ceramic colours, 

precious metal powders and/or flakes and iridescent or micaceous-type pigments. 
A transfer according to any one of claims 9-12 which is decorative 
and wherein the decorative or functional material is a ceramic colour comprising 

colour pigment and a flux in a weight ratio of from 0.1-9 parts of flux to 1 part of 
pigment. 
A transfer according to any one of claims 9-13 which has a multi-colour 
or complex effect built up by having a plurality of such patterns of different 

decorative or functional materials. 
A method of forming a decorative or functional pattern on an article, 
which method comprises transferring the pattern to the article from a transfer 

claimed in any one of claims 9-14 or produced by a method claimed in any one of 
claims 1-8. 
A method according to claim 15 wherein after transferring the pattern, 
it is fired o
n the article. 
A method according to claim 16 wherein the article is ceramic or 
glass.
