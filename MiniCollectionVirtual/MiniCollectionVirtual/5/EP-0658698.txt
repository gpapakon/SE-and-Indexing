<ABSTRACT>
An automatic clutch controller for a vehicle that 
reduces the oscillatory response to clutch engagement. The 

automatic clutch controller receives inputs from an engine 
speed sensor and a transmission input speed sensor and 

develops a clutch actuation signal controlling a clutch 
actuator from disengaged to fully engaged. The clutch 

engagement signal at least partially engages the friction 
clutch in a manner to cause the measured transmission input 

speed to asymptotically approach engine speed employing an 
approximate inverse model of this oscillatory response. 

The automatic clutch controller preferably includes a slip 
integral function and a differential engine speed function, 

which together adaptively adjust clutch engagement 
corresponding to vehicle loading. The automatic clutch 

controller includes a prefilter and a compensator 
constructed to reduce the need for detailed 

particularization for individual vehicles or vehicle 
models. 
A lag compensation function in the compensator 
adds robustness to the system by increasing low frequency 

gain. A freeze function suspends operation of the slip 
integral, the prefilter and the compensator during engine 

deceleration or when throttle position is high and engine 
speed is low, to moderate or stop clutch advance to prevent 

engine overloading.

<DESCRIPTION>
The technical field of this invention is that of
automatic clutch controls, and more particularly closed
loop automatic clutch control and method for reducing
oscillatory response to launch of a motor vehicle.In recent years there has been a growing interest
in increased automation in the control of the drive train
of motor vehicles, and most especially in control of the
drive train of large trucks. The use of automatic
transmissions in passenger automobiles and light trucks is
well known. The typical automatic transmission in such a
vehicle employs a fluid torque converter and hydraulically
actuated gears for selecting the final drive ratio between
the engine shaft and the drive wheels. This gear selection
is based upon engine speed, vehicle speed and the like. It
is well known that such automatic transmissions reduce the
effectiveness of the transmission of power from the engine
to the drive shaft, with the consummate reduction in fuel
economy and power as compared with the skilled operation of
a manual transmission. Such hydraulic automatic
transmissions have not achieved wide spread use in large 
motor trucks because of the reduction in efficiency of the
operation of the vehicle.One of the reasons for the loss of efficiency
when employing a hydraulic automatic transmission is loss
occurring in the fluid torque converter. A typical fluid
torque converter exhibits slippage and consequent loss of
torque and power in all modes. It is known in the art to
provide lockup torque converters that provide a direct link
between the input shaft and the output shaft of the
transmission above certain engine speeds. This technique
provides adequate torque transfer efficiency when engaged,
however, this technique provides no gain in efficiency at
lower speeds.It has been proposed to eliminate the
inefficiencies inherent in a hydraulic torque converter by
substitution of an automatically actuated friction clutch.
This substitution introduces another problem not exhibited
in the use of the hydraulic torque converters. The
mechanical drive train of a motor vehicle typically
exhibits considerable torsional compliance in the driveline
between the transmission and the traction wheels of the
vehicle. This torsional compliance may be found in the
drive shaft between the transmission and the differential
or the axle shaft between the differential and the driven
wheels. It is often the case that independent design
criteria encourages or requires this driveline to exhibit
considerable torsional compliance. The existence of
