<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical 
and organic chemistry and provides novel compounds, and 
pharmaceutical compositions thereof, which are useful for 
enhancing the expression of insulin from mammalian pancreatic B-type 
islet cells and for treating maturity onset diabetes 
mellitus in a mammal. The endocrine secretions of the pancreatic islets are 
under complex control not only by blood-borne metabolites 
(glucose, amino acids, catecholamines, etc.), but also by local 
paracrine influences. The major pancreatic islet hormones 
(glucagon, insulin and somatostatin) interact amongst their 
specific cell types (A, B, and D cells, respectively) to 
modulate secretory responses mediated by the aforementioned 
metabolites. Although insulin secretion is predominantly 
controlled by blood levels of glucose, somatostatin inhibits 
glucose-mediated insulin secretory responses. In addition to 
the proposed interislet paracrine regulation of insulin 
secretion, there is evidence to support the existence of 
insulinotropic factors in the intestine. This concept 
originates from the observations that glucose taken orally is a 
much more potent stimulant of insulin secretion than is a 
comparable amount of glucose given intravenously. The human hormone glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide 
hormone produced in the A-cells of the pancreas. The hormone 
belongs to a multi-gene family of structurally related peptides 
that include secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide, vasoactive 
intestinal peptide and glicentin. These peptides variously 
regulate carbohydrate metabolism, gastrointestinal mobility and 
secretory processing. The principal recognized actions of 
pancreatic glucagon, however, are to promote hepatic 
glycogenolysis and glyconeogenesis, resulting in an elevation of 
blood sugar levels. In this regard, the actions of glucagon are 
counter regulatory to those of insulin and may contribute to the 
hyperglycemia that accompanies Diabetes mellitus [(Lund, P.K., 
et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 79:345-349 (1982)].  Glucagon has been found to be capable of binding to 
specific receptors which lie on the surface of insulin producing 
cells. Glucagon, when bound to these receptors, stimulates the 
rapid synthesis of cAMP by these cells. cAMP, in turn, has been 
found to stimulate insulin expression [Korman, L.Y., et al., 
Diabetes, 34:717-722 (1985)]. Insulin acts to inhibit glucagon 
synthesis [Ganong, W.F., Review of Medical Physiology, Lange 
Publications, Los Altos, California, p.
