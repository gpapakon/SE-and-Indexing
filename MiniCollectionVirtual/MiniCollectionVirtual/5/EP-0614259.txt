<ABSTRACT>
This differential circuit breaker is of the type including an integrating current transformer and a trigger circuit with, on the one hand, a first electronic switch which, actuated by the fault current appearing in the integrating current transformer, controls, when it is switched, a trip switch which cuts off at least one phase of the mains and, on the other hand, a circuit (2) for sensing an overvoltage, connected to the trigger circuit (7) in such a way that this circuit (2), in the event of an overvoltage appearing, actuates the first electronic circuit breaker (14), and, consequently, the trip switch (8), and it is characterised in that, a delay element (17) generating a triggering delay being provided, the circuit for sensing an overvoltage (2) is mounted in parallel with this time-delay element (17).

A differential protective switch of the kind comprising a
summing current transformer and a tripping circuit and in which on the

one hand a first electronic switch actuated by thefault current appearing
in the summing current transformer controls upon switching thereof a trip

device (8) which cuts at least one phase of the network and on the other
hand a circuit (2) for detecting an overvoltage is connected to the

tripping circuit (7) in such a way that in the event of an overvoltage
occurring the circuit (2) actuates the first electronic switch (14) and

consequently the trip device (8), characterised in that, a time delay
member (17) for producing a tripping time delay being provided,and thus

being a selective switch which involves an inherent current, the circuit
(2) for detecting an overvoltage is connected at the output in parallel

to said time delay member (17) to deliver the supply power necessary to
the trip device (8), and that said time delay member (17) is a power

accumulator.
A differential protective switch according to claim 1
characterised in that the circuit (2) for detecting an overvoltage

comprises an assembly (18, 19, 22, 23) for regulating the tripping
threshold of the electronic switch (14).
A differential protective switch according to either one of
claims 1 and 2 characterised in that there is provided a second

electronic switch (20, 25) serving to control the first electronic switch
(14) in dependence on the overvoltage.
A differential protective switch according to claim 3
characterised in that the second electronic switch is a programmable

unijunction transistor (20).
A differential protective switch according to claim 3
characterised in that the second electronic switch is a thyristor (25). 
A differential protective switch according to claims 2 and 3 in
combination characterised in that the assembly (18, 19, 22, 23) is a

resistance circuit having two voltage divider stages of which the first
stage (18, 19) in the overvoltage situation delivers the electrical power

for controlling the first and the second electronic switches (14, 20, 25)
and for controlling the trip device (8) and the second stage (22, 23)

essentially produces the voltage applied to the control input of the
second electronic switch (20, 25).
A differential protective switch according to claims 2 and 3 in
combination characterised in that the second electronic switch (20, 25)

has a switching threshold higher than that of the first electronic switch
(14).
