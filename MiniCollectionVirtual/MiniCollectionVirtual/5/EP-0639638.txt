<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a high active granular detergent 
component or composition having a bulk density of at least 

650 g/l which comprises the steps of: 

i) making a paste or liquid which comprises at least 40% by 
weight of a surfactant selected from anionic and nonionic 

surfactants, 
ii) mixing said surfactant paste or liquid with a powder to 
form a mixture which may be in the form of either a paste 

or a cohesive powder; 
iii) forming granules by fine dispersion mixing or 
granulation of said mixture, optionally in the presence of 

an effective amount of one or more additional powders; 
 
wherein the powder used in step ii) comprises a free-flowing, 

premixed powder comprising from 0.5% to 10% by 
weight of a hydrophobic silica and from 75% to 99.5% by 

weight of a hygroscopic powder comprising a polymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for making 
granular detergent which have a high surfactant activity 
and which are free-flowing and rapidly dissolving. In 
another aspect the invention relates to a premixed free-flowing 
powder which comprises hydrophobic silica and a 
hygroscopic powder which comprises a polymer. In a third 
aspect the invention relates to high active, high bulk 
density granular detergent compositions. Granular detergent granules comprising low levels of 
certain polymers which provide structure or strength to the 
granule are known and have been made by spray drying 
aqueous solutions or slurries comprising the polymer. 
However, spray dried granules have low bulk densities (for 
example 350-550 g/l). Further treatment is necessary in 
order to increase the bulk density and various methods have 
been proposed to do this. One approach is to apply 
mechanical work to the spray dried powder in order to 
reduce its porosity and increase its bulk density. Another 
approach is to granulate a liquid or paste, typically in 
the presence of a powder. Polymers may be added to such a  
 
process either as a component of the liquid/paste, or as a 
component of the powder. Examples in the prior art of the 
such processes include: EPA 421 664, published on 10th April, 1992, describes high 
bulk density compositions comprising polymer and water 
soluble inorganic component. Compositions comprising 
surfactants and hydrophobic silica are not foreseen. EPA 510 746, published on 28th October, 1992, describes a 
process of fine dispersion mixing of a viscous surfactant 
paste with detergent powders to form a granular detergent. 
Polymers and silica are mentioned as useful ingredients in 
such a detergent composition. However there is no 
suggestion of how they may be most usefully combined. EPA 513 824, published on 19th November, 1992 describes a 
process for making granular detergents which comprise up to 
60% by weight of nonionic surfactant. It suggests that 
various powder components may be premixed in order to 
improve physical properties, but it does not indicate which 
powders may be advantageously premixed. When it is required to use higher levels of polymers in 
high bulk density granular detergent components, the 
hygroscopic nature of many polymers presents a problem. In 
particular this is the case when the component also 
comprises a high level of surfactant. Hygroscopic powders 
which are bound into the surface of the detergent component 
cause the component to readily absorb
