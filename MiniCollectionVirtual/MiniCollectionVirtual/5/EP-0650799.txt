<ABSTRACT>
The tool according to the invention consists of a 
compass with special rod-holder unit (1) rotating and 

frictioning around a vertical pivoting pin (4) projecting from 
a support deck (5) having a pair of parallel horizontal spigots (5a) 

at the back by which the same may be fitted to the front 
ends of the pair of rods (2A) of standard compasses.

<DESCRIPTION>
This design patent application concerns a tool for
carpentry calipers for making curved frames with joined end
corners according to the pre-characterizing part of claim 1 and
as known for example from US-A-4.324.514.Currently inexpensive and easy to use carpentry calipers
are available on the market which are generally used to
curve the circumference of wing profiles of frames with
curved lintel.These calipers basically consist of a parallelepiped unit
revolving on a vertical pivoting pin having at the base a
circular flange with a gauged perimeter, which is screwed
to the working bench.This unit acts as a support and guide for a pair of long
parallel horizontal rods intersecting the same and sliding
freely in both directions.A support bracket is fitted at the two front ends of said
rods for the electric cutter which is generally used to
shape the wings of the frame. A sliding block being fitted on the above pair of rods
characterised by a stopping mechanism on which a "revolver"
unit is fitted the same consisting of a revolving centre
tower from which a number of horizontal rods in different
lengths project; this "revolver" unit being used when
necessary to produce a preset series of concentric curved
profiles having different radii of curvature.Obviously the number of concentric profiles that can be
produced is the same as the number of gauged rods of the
"revolver" unit, while the difference between the radii of
curvature of the different profiles of the series will
quite naturally be exactly equal to the difference between
the length of the gauged rods on the revolving tower.In view of the fact that in the large majority of cases,
the vault of the frames is always inferior to that of the
semi-circumference curve, an unattractive edge will
inevitably be formed at the intersection point between the
lintel vault and the two side uprights.The purpose of this invention is to create a structurally
simple and inexpensive tool for installation on the above
carpentry calipers as an accessory to produce connection
curves between the curved profile of the transverse and the
rectilinear sections of the uprights of the frame.The tool according to the invention is characterised by a
similar structural configuration and operating principle as
that of standard carpentry calipers, which are also used to
curve profiles, be it with much smaller radii of curvature
than those of the lintel vault. The tool according to the invention consists essentially of
the above type of calipers characterised by a rod-holder
unit

<CLAIMS>
A tool for carpentry calipers for curved frames with
joined end corners characterised by a prismatic unit (1)

acting as a support and guide for a pair of parallel
horizontal rods (2) intersecting the same and sliding

freely in both directions, but which can be stopped by
means of a fixing ring nut (3) positioned above the unit

(1) which can rotate, overcoming the resistance caused by a
friction element, around a vertical pivoting pin (4)

projecting from a deck (5) immediately under the unit (1)
having at the back a pair of parallel spigots (5a) with

horizontal axis; a sliding block (7) being fitted and
sliding on the pair of rods (2); said sliding block (7)

consisting of a prismatic unit on which a "revolver" unit
is mounted consisting of a revolving tower (8) on which a

number of radial rods (8a) of different lengths are screwed
and cooperate, when the "revolver" unit is used, with a

striking and reference plate (1a) being provided on the
back of the unit (1). 
A tool for carpentry calipers for curved frames with
joined end corners according to claim 1, characterised in

that in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
friction element preventing the free rotation of the unit

(1) with respect to its pivoting pin (4), consists of a
pair of spheres (6) housed in two cavities (5a) on the

upper face of the deck (5) and subjected to the expelling
force of respective precompressed springs (6b); each of

said spheres being partially expelled from their housings
(6a) and fixed within a corresponding conical impression

(6c) on the bottom face of the unit (1).
