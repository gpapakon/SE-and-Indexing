<ABSTRACT>
Described is a drive-slip control system which actuates the brakes when the wheels spin. A maximum brake torque, dependent on the drive torque, is defined in order to avoid the engine being stalled by operation of the anti-slip control system.

Drive-slip control method (ASR) in which, on 
the appearance of drive-slip, brake pressure is fed in 

at the driven wheels, characterized in that the drive 
torque M
A
 and the braking torque M
Br
 is determined at 
the driven wheels and in that the braking torques 

produced by the ASR are limited by a maximum permissible 
braking torque variation M
Br max
 which is 0 
below the engine zero torque and increases with 

increasing drive torque, and/or in that the drive 
torque is increased when a specified braking torque 

variation dependent on the drive torque M
A
 is exceeded. 
Drive-slip control method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that in the case of a braking torque 

located above the maximum braking torque, pressure is 
reduced at the wheel brakes until a value M
Br max
 - K₃ 
is reached, K₃ being a constant value. 
Drive-slip control method according to Claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that the sum of the braking 

torques is formed and in that, when M
Br max
 is exceeded 
by this sum, limitation of the braking torques at both 

wheels takes place and/or the engine torque is 
increased. 
Drive-slip control method according to one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that when the braking 

torque of one wheel reaches the maximum braking torque, 
the engine torque is increased and, when the sum 

reaches the maximum braking torque, the braking torque 
is limited.  

 
Drive-slip control method according to one of 
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the maximum braking 

torque is reduced as a function of time. 
Drive-slip control method according to one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the limiting 

and/or the raising is only effective in the drive-away 
range (for example up to 35 km/h). 
Drive-slip control method according to one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that when M
Br max
 is 
calculated, a factor is taken into account which 

depends on the ratio of the control deviations at the 
driven wheels. 
Drive-slip control method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the engine torque is only raised 

when no pressure is fed in at a wheel. 
Drive-slip control method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the maximum permissible braking 

torque is determined in accordance with the equation 

M
Br max
 = 
M
A
K
2
 - K
1
 
where K₁ and K₂ are constant. 
Drive-slip control method according to 
Claim 9, characterized in that the constant K₁ and/or 

the constant K₂ additionally varies with the roadway 
slope and the latter is determined by means of a slope 

sensor/acceleration sensor or by means of engine drag 
torques.
