<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame-retardant
aromatic polycarbonate resin composition and
a molded article therefrom. More specifically, it
relates to an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition
which is remarkably free from corroding a molding
machine and a processing machine, retains excellent
properties inherent to an aromatic polycarbonate resin
and has excellent flame retardancy, and a molded
article formed therefrom.Having many excellent properties, an aromatic
polycarbonate resin is widely used in a large amount in
a variety of fields. Since, however, an aromatic
polycarbonate resin is combustible, it is required to
have severe flame retardancy in some fields. For
imparting an aromatic polycarbonate resin with flame
retardancy, there is known a conventional method in
which an organic halogen compound is incorporated into
the aromatic polycarbonate resin. For example,
Japanese Patent Publication No. 47-44537 discloses a
method in which a polycarbonate oligomer obtained from
tetrabromobisphenol A as a dihydroxy component is
incorporated in such an amount that the bromine
concentration is 5 to 15 % by weight. Japanese Patent
Publication No. 47-24660 discloses a method in which a
carbonate copolymer obtained from tetrabromobisphenol A
and bisphenol A as dihydroxy components is incorporated
in such an amount that the bromine concentration is 5
to 9 % by weight. However, when a flame-retardant
aromatic polycarbonate resin composition containing
such a bromine-based flame retardant is molded or
processed, a molding machine or a processing machine is
liable to be corroded, and the corrosion is intensified 
with an increase in the bromine concentration. It is
therefore desired to develop an aromatic polycarbonate
resin which is free from corroding a molding machine
and a processing machine and has excellent flame
retardancy.Further, there is known a method in which a
bromine-free flame retardant is incorporated into an
aromatic polycarbonate resin. Japanese Patent
Publication No. 47-40445 discloses a method in which
potassium perfluoroalkanesulfonate is incorporated into
an aromatic polycarbonate resin. According to this
method, the amount of corrosive toxic gas decreases,
while the resin composition shows a decrease in heat
stability when the resin composition contains the
potassium perfluoroalkanesulfonate in a sufficient
amount for exhibiting adequate flame retardancy.US-3775367 and US-4174359 also disclose the addition of alkali metal
perfluoroalkane sulfonates to polycarbonate resin
