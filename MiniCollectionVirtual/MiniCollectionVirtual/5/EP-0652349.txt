<ABSTRACT>
A preassembled roller shutter box comprises a 
roller for the roller shutter, a pin (20) projecting from 

the opposing heads thereof for connection with the end 
supports consisting of a plate (22) and a flange (24) 

engaged and constrained in an elastic manner in an 
opening (34) of the plate (22) and having in its centre a 

circular seat (50) for a ball bearing (52) with 
integrated front bush (58). 
On said bush is provided a threaded hole which 
receives a set screw (60) designed to be tightened on the 

pin (20) of the shutter roller previously engaged with 
said bush.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a preassembled
roller shutter box with roller shutter for windows and
door windowsMore specifically the present invention relates to
a roller shutter box with roller shutter in which the
various elements consisting of the roller on which is
wound the roller shutter and the related supporting means
are previously assembled and positioned enbloc in the
seat defined by the compartment above the window or door
window. A preassembled roller shutter box according to the preamble of claim 1
is known from FR-A-2550270. This document describes a preassembled
roller shutter box with roller shutter for windows and door windows
comprising a tubular body having opposed extensions engaged at its
ends and therein elastically constrained and pairs of means for
housing and clamping each of the pins emerging from the extensions,
wherein said means consist respectively of a metal plate with extended
central opening and a flange of plastic material or equivalent engaged
under pressure and elastically constrained along the peripheral edge
of said opening projecting orthogonally away from the tubular body
and, in a circular seat formed on said flange, there being housed and
retained a bearing with front collar projecting towards the pins.
GB-A-2181475 describes a roller shutter box wherein the means for
housing and clamping the pins emerging from the extensions consist of
a single plate without flange.As known, the installation 
of external window and door frames
formed by roller shutters in the openings created in the
walls of buildings involves conventionally a series of
laborious operations which must be performed directly at
the work site. Indeed, it is necessary to position in
the upper part of the opening the shaft or roller of the
roller shutter and connect it with the respective end
supports. Said shutter must also be constrained to the
roller and the operating devices consisting e.g. of a
pulley and a winch or motor which must in turn be
connected to a support integral with a roller head.These are laborious operations which require
considerable time for performance and are excessively
difficult because the work must be done while standing on
ladders or scaffolding.The object of the present invention is to overcome 
the above shortcomings.More specifically, the object of the present
invention is to provide a roller shutter box with roller
shutter in which the various components are already
assembled and are installed enbloc rapidly and easily in
the window or door window opening at
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A preassembled roller shutter box with a roller shutter for windows and
door windows comprising:


a tubular body (10) having opposed extensions (12) with pins (20)
emerging therefrom, said extensions being engaged at the ends of the

tubular body (10) and elastically constrained therein;
a bearing (52) fixed to the free end of each of the pins (20);
means (22, 24, 22') for housing and clamping each of the pins (20), said
means comprising a plate (22, 22') having a central circular seat (50, 50') and upper (26, 26'), lower

(28, 28') and side (30, 30', 32, 32') edges bent at 90°, said bearing (52)
being engaged under pressure and elastically clamped in said central seat

(50),

characterized in that the upper (26, 26') and lower edges (28, 28') of the
plate (22,22') are

outwardly bent at 90° in the same direction and away from the tubular
body (10) and the side edges (30, 30', 32, 32') are bent at 90° in opposite

directions to each other, and in that the plate (22, 22') has
a plurality of seats

consisting of holes (62, 62') and recesses (64, 64') arranged
concentrically with respect to the central circular seat (50).
The preassembled roller shutter box according to claim 1, wherein the
means (22, 24) for housing and clamping each of the pins (20)

comprises a metal plate (22) having a central opening (34) peripherically
delimited by an edge (36), and a flange (24) having a shape

complementary to that of said opening (34), said flange (24) being
engaged under pressure and elastically constrained in said peripheral edge

(36) of said opening (34) of the metal plate (22), said central circular
seat (50), holes (62) and recesses being formed in said flange (24). 
The preassembled roller shutter box according to claim 2, wherein the
flange (24) is provided with an upper longitudinally extending lowering (48),

which forms a striker on the edge (36) of the opening (34); with a lower
longitudinally extending milling (48'), which receives at least partially the

base of the edge (36) of the opening (34), and with opposite elastic
projecting tooths (46) engaged into corresponding slots (44) formed in the

edge (36) of the metal plate (22).
The preassembled roller shutter box according to claim 2 or 3, wherein
the upper edge (26) of the plate (22) is provided with a narrow slot (38)

along its longitudinal axis which devides said edge (26) into two parallel
strips connected together; the outermost (40) of said strips being movable

away from the plate (22) and being provided with a hole (42) at its free
end.
The preassembled roller shutter box according to anyone of the
preceding claims, wherein the central seat (50) is provided with at least

two opposing elastic teeth (54) formed inside the flange (24) to provide
locking of the bearing (52).
The preassembled roller shutter box according to claim 1, wherein the
means (22') for housing and clamping each of the pins (20) is a

single quadrangular metal sheet (22') having the central circular seat (50')
and said holes (62') and recesses (64') being formed therein,

and the upper (26') and the lower (28') bent edges each having a narrow
longitudinal slot (38') deviding each edge (26', 28') into two parallel

strips connected together; each outermost (40') of said strips being
movable away from the plate (22') and being provided with a hole (42') at

its free end.
The preassembled roller shutter box according to claim 6, wherein the
metal sheet (22') is provided on its outer face with a first and second 

series of L-shaped projecting tabs (36') parallel to the upper (26') and
lower (28') edges and aligned with the opposite ends of the side edges

(30', 32'); the first series of the L-shaped projecting tabs being arranged
between the holes and recesses (62', 64') and the upper edge (26') and

being bent upwardly towards the upper edge (26'), and the second series
of the L-shaped projecting tabs being arranged between the holes and

recesses (62', 64') and the lower edge (28') and being bent downwardly
towards the lower edge (28').
