<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a monitoring system for an industrial plant, allowing patrols to be carried out by at least one operator, the said system including at least one central terminal (22) associated with a transmission/reception means (23), identification tags arranged at various measuring points (12) located at defined locations in the plant, and at least one portable terminal (26) available to each operator, associated with a data transmission/ reception means (27) for communicating with the central terminal and with a tag reader means (28). These tags comprise electronic tags, the contents of which can be read and modified by writing. Electronic labels arranged on the automatic equipment to be monitored each contain an updated database intrinsic to the characteristics of the said equipment. The reading means associated with each portable terminal also makes it possible to write into these electronic tags. Application in particular to systematic monitoring of nuclear plants.

System for monitoring an industrial installation making it possible for at 
least one operator to perform rounds, said system incorporating at least one 

central terminal (22) associated with a transmission-reception means (23), 
identification labels located at different plotting or recording points (12) 

at predetermined locations within the installation, and at least one portable 
terminal (26) available to the operator associated with a data transmission-reception 

means (27) for communicating with the central terminal and a means 
(28) for reading the labels, characterized in that said labels comprise electronic 

labels, whose content can be read and modified by writing, wherein the 
electronic labels located on automatic equipments to be controlled, in each 

case contain a base for updated data concerning the characteristics of said 
equipments and wherein the reading means associated with each portable terminal 

also permits writing in said electronic labels. 
System according to claim 1, characterized in that an electronic label 
comprises a capsule containing a battery and a chip installed on a printed 

microcircuit connected to the two poles of the battery and wherein said capsule 
communicates with the exterior by two contacts, namely by a bidirectional 

transmission line for informations, contact taking place by the upper surface 
of the capsule, and by a reference line, contact taking place by the periphery 

or bottom of the capsule. 
System according to claim 2, characterized in that a capsule comprises 
a protected non-volatile memory and a ROM. 
System according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
it comprises a portable terminal having a microcomputer, a high power 

transmitter-receiver and a modem coupled to an electronic label reader. 
System according to claim 4, characterized in that the portable terminal 
makes it possible to control both data transmission and radiophony communication 

with the central terminal and with other portable terminals.  
 
System according to either of the claims 4 and 5, characterized in that 
the software in the microcomputer of the portable terminal interrupts the 

power supply for the modem and the transmission-receiver when the latter is not 
in use and wherein the microcomputer, transmitter-receiver and modem have a 

power supply control device reducing consumption to a minimum when waiting.
