<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed for separating components of an azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture containing only organic compounds at least one of which compound is a halocarbon comprising contacting said azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture with a semipermeable membrane to form at least one exit stream having an increased concentration of at least one component and at least one other exit stream having an increased concentration of at least one other component of the azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture and, thereafter, recovering at least one exit stream.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for 
separating the components of an azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture 
containing only organic compounds of which at least one compound is a 
halocarbon wherein it is difficult and/or impractical to separate the 
azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture by conventional means. More 
specifically, the present invention relates to separating the components of 
such azeotropic or azeotrope-like mixture by contacting the mixture with 
a semipermeable membrane to form at least one exit stream having an 
increased concentration of at least one component and at least one other 
exit stream having an increased concentration of at least one other 
component. The exit streams from the contacting step may, thereafter, be 
recycled for contact with the semipermeable membrane or further 
processed by conventional means to achieve additional separation and/or 
recovery of a desired component. It is well known that halocarbons of commercial interest 
including chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), hydrogen-containing 
chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC'S), hydrogen-containing fluorocarbons 
(HFC's) and perfluorocarbons (FC's) can be manufactured by processes 
involving halogen exchange reactions wherein a halocarbon which 
contains a halogen substituent (most often a chlorine substituent) other 
than or in addition to a fluorine substituent is reacted with a fluorine-donor 
compound. The fluorine-donor compound is capable of donating a 
fluorine atom in halogen exchange reactions such as a metal fluoride or 
hydrogen fluoride used in the presence of various catalytic compounds. 
The desired product is obtained together with by-products such as under- 
or over-fluorinated products, decomposition products, unreacted 
reactants and the like. The desired product usually must then be 
separated from these by-products and/or contaminants. While most separations of this type are carried out readily by  
 
well known processes such as distillation, phase separation and the like, 
some separations present problems which preclude using these processes 
especially when halocarbons form azeotropic or azeotrope-like 
compositions with other compounds. One example of this problem is in the manufacture of a fluoro-olefin, 
tetrafluoroethylene (CF2 = CF2; TFE). TFE is an important 
component in the manufacture of TFE fluorocarbon resins. TFE is 
usually manufactured by the pyrolysis reaction of 
monochlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2; HCFC-22), which reaction can be 
represented by the equation: 
It is
