A hydraulic brake system with slip control, including a 
pedal-operable master cylinder (12), preferably assisted by 

auxiliary force, to which a front-wheel and a rear-wheel 
brake (VA, HA) of an automotive vehicle are connected at 

least by way of a main pressure line (2), including a 
hydraulic auxiliary-pressure pump (16) which is connected to 

an auxiliary-pressure line (15) and takes in pressure medium 
from a reservoir (14) and supplies it to the wheel brakes 

(VA, HA), and including wheel sensors and a controlling and 
regulating electronic unit (5) to determine the wheel 

rotational behaviour and to generate electric braking 
pr
essure control signals, and pressure modulation valves (1, 
6) for braking pressure control on the wheel brakes (VA, HA),
characterised
 in that a piston of a 
pressure-medium displacing element (3), which piston is 

sealed and axially movable in a housing (10), is connected to 
the main pressure line (2) leading to the rear-wheel brake 

(HA), the pressure of the auxiliary-pressure pump (16) being 
adapted to be applied to a first end surface (4) of the 

piston, and in that the pressure prevailing in the rear-wheel 
brake (HA) is adapted to be applied to a second end surface 

(8) which is arranged opposite to the first end surface (4), 
in that the piston of the pressure-medium displacing element 

(3) has an initial position in the housing (10 which 
increases the medium volume in the direction of the rear-wheel 

brake (HA), in that, in dependence on the stroke and 
the nominal diameter of the second end surface (8) on the 

piston, a pressure medium volume, which corresponds to the 
wheel braking pressure necessary for the slip-free 

application of the rear-wheel brake (HA), is displaced during  
 

slip control, when the auxiliary-pressure pump (16) is 
operative, and in that an open connection exists between the 

master cylinder (12) and the wheel brakes (VA, HA) when the 
pressure modulation valves (1, 6) are not operated. 
A hydraulic brake system as claimed in claim 1,

pressure-medium displacing element (3). 
A hydraulic brake system as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims,
