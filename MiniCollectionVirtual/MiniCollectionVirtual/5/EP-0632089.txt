<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
removing particulate components deposited as impurities on
the molded products of fluorine-containing resin.Currently even fine particles of submicron size
must be removed from the molded products of fluorine-containing
resin in the field of the so-called high
technology. Further, a demand for higher degree of
cleaning is expected to increase.For example, containers made of fluorine-containing
resin are currently used for holding an agent
for wet etching in production of semiconductors, i.e.
representative products in the field of the high
technology. These containers are usually cleaned with a
dilute aqueous solution of a surfactant, strong acid,
ultrapure water, or when required, may be
cleaned by supersonic treatment or immersion. These
methods, however, can not achieve a satisfactory level of
cleaning on containers of fluorine-containing resin,
compared with the level on containers of polyethylene and
therefore may be unempolyable for containers for holding
an agent for wet etching.More specifically, the containers of fluorine-containing
resin for holding a 50% aqueous solution of HF 
to be used in the manufacture of semiconductors must be
cleaned to such an extent that after cleaning, 10 particles
or less are contained in one milliliter of the
solution in terms of the particles not smaller than 0.3 µm
in particle size, and that after cleaning, one particle or
less is contained in one milliliter thereof in terms of
the particles not smaller than 0.5 µm in particle size.
The cleaning with ultrapure water can not attain the above
levels at all.As prior art there is known JP-A-63-310683 which
discloses a method of cleaning an article of fluorine-containing
resin, the method comprising the steps of
introducing steam into a washing container, maintaining
the container at a high temperature, a high pressure and
a high humidity, reducing the internal pressure of the
container and rapidly cooling the article by showering
water over the article. However, the publication sets
forth nowhere that fine particles can be removed from
the article of fluorine-containing resin to a satisfactory
cleaning level by maintaining the article at a high temperature
in the atmosphere of inactive gas.J. Colloid and Interface Science 47 (1974) 650 describes
a method of elucidating the nature of the surface
of articles made of polymers, and states on page 655 a
method wherein an etched sample is exposed to 200°C in
a circulating air oven in one of post-treatments of the 
etched

<CLAIMS>
A method for removing the fine particles deposited
on an article of fluorine-containing resin, the method

comprising maintaining the article of fluorine-containing
resin at a temperature of not lower than 150°C to a temperature

lower than the melting point of the article in the atmosphere of inactive
gas. 
Method as defined in claim 1 in which the article
is cleaned at least once with at least one of ultrapure

water, a cleaning agent and an aqueous solution of electrolyte
at a concentration of not lower than 0.5 % by weight,

before or after, or both before and after maintaining the
article of fluorine-containing resin at a temperature of

not lower than 150°C to a temperature lower than the melting point of the article in the atmosphere of inactive gas.
