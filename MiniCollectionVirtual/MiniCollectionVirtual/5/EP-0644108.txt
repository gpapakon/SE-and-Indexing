invention comprises a suspension system (100) and a brake 

system (200). The suspension system (100) has an 
eccentric retainer (10) comprising an axle (22) and two 

L-shaped members (21), and a shaft portion (23) carried 
by each housing (10) extends through a respective elastic 

body (41) at a perpendicularly upper part of the axle. 
The suspension system (100) is so designed that it makes 

possible rocking motion relative to the front wheel and 
around the axis of the shaft portion (23) with the 

distance between the shaft portion (23) and the axle (21) 
as its radius, within a range of specified limited 

rocking angles, and the brake system (200) is so designed 
that a side surface of its rim (62) is made wide in a 

radial direction and the side surface (62a) is 
approximately perpendicular. Since this invention is 

made by inventing a principle of a new suspension system 
having the simplest structure, the lightest weight and 

the smallest cost and can improve properties of running 
and braking.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bicycle front wheel and a front wheel 
control mechanism equipped with a suspension system and 
a brake system. Fig. 25 is a view showing a working principle of a 
general conventional suspension system. 1 denotes a 
body, 2 denotes a wheel, and 3 denotes a coil spring. 
This suspension system is so devised that, when the body 
1 and the wheel 2 advance in a direction of arrow A to 
pass over a bump 4 of a road surface, the coil spring 3 
compresses in a vertical direction to allow the wheel 2 
to move upwards so as to moderate a shock given to the 
body 1. It has hitherto been considered that the suspension 
system as mentioned above has not necessarily been 
required for an ordinary bicycle for the following 
reasons (1) to (3). 
(1) The bicycle is a vehicle which is pedalled by a 
rider. However, when the suspension system as mentioned 
above is adopted, the body 1 can vibrate in the vertical 
direction by means of the coil spring 3 with the result 
that the rider cannot pedal it with all his strength. 
Such a phenomenon is expressed as "lost of force". (2) Part of the kinetic energy developed by the rider 
is transformed to a vibration energy within the 
suspension system so increasing fatigue of the rider.  
 (3) Since an ordinary bicycle does not travel at high 
speed, shocks felt by the rider are comparatively small 
when he pedals the bicycle on a rough road. Therefore, 
there is little need for a suspension system. Consequently, the use of the suspension system as 
mentioned above is typically limited to a bicycle such as 
"mountain bicycles" for riding around hills and fields 
for pleasure, such a bicycle being used for descending 
steep slopes and crossing rough terrain. On the other hand, airplanes and automobiles are 
equipped with anti-skid devices in order to prevent their 
wheels from being locked during braking. The reason for 
this is that, when a wheel is locked during braking, not 
only does the braking distance increase, but also 
steering control may be lost, which may result in the 
vehicle moving in a direction other than that intended by 
its driver with dangerous consequences. Such a device 
for preventing the locking of wheels during braking is 
considered to be desirable also for a bicycle. However, 
an appropriate system has not hitherto been available. In recent years, the field of bicycle technology has 
been undergoing rapid development. Speeds of bicycles 
are approaching those of motor-cycles owing to 
developments of ultra light-weight
