<ABSTRACT>
A seal assembly (10) for a movable window pane (46) which 
is raisable or lowerable in a vehicle window opening 

includes a one-piece, closed-loop construction which is 
formed from two molded sealing elements (28,30) secured together 

to form a sealing member adapted to be secured along the 
periphery of a window opening and to provide continuous 

sealing engagement with the interior and exterior periphery 
of the movable window pane. The one-piece seal 

assembly replaces a plurality of individual sealing 
components which are conventionally used to provide the 

weather seal between a vehicle window opening and a 
movable window pane which slides up or down to open or 

close the window opening. 
A method for forming a one-piece, closed-loop 
seal assembly includes the steps of molding an inner 

sealing element (28) having a continuous, closed-loop structure, 
molding an outer sealing element (30) having a continuous, 

closed-loop structure, and then securing the sealing 
elements together to form a one-piece, closed-loop sealing 

member adapted to seal between a vehicle window opening 
and a window pane which can be raised or lowered within 

the opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to weather seal assemblies
for movable window panes in automotive vehicles. In one
general aspect it proposes a unitary, closed-loop seal
assembly which provides continuous sealing engagement with
both the interior and exterior periphery of a movable window
pane of a vehicle door. In another general aspect it
relates to methods of making such assemblies, particularly
as a unitary closed-loop seal assembly having interior and
exterior sealing elements which co-operatively provide
continuous sealing engagement about both the interior and
the exterior periphery of a movable window pane.Conventional seals for movable window panes in
automotive vehicles generally include a plurality of
individual sealing strips including, for example, individual
glass runs, header, and inner and outer beltstrips.
The assembly process for conventional movable window seals
is generally cumbersome and time consuming, requiring the
separate sequential attachment of each individual sealing
strip to the window opening of the vehicle. In addition,
the use of a plurality of individual sealing strips to
seal a single window opening often results in gaps between
adjacent edges of individual sealing strips. Gaps between
adjacent sealing strips are undesirable because they are
aesthetically unpleasing, and can often allow water and
air leakage, along with the noise and draftiness associated
with air leakage.Another disadvantage with conventional seals for
movable window panes in automotive vehicles is that the
sealing strips are generally extruded and therefore have
a constant cross sectional shape and size, thereby effectively
restricting the contours of doors utilizing such
sealing strips to relatively simple geometric structures
which are substantially free of offsets, indentations, and 
the like in the window opening.The dimensional reproducibility of extruded articles
is also non-ideal, with typical dimensional variations
being about ±4 percent. Variations of this magnitude can
result in unsightly discontinuities between adjacent
installed sealing strips, and can lead to waste due to
the rejection of sealing strips having intolerable
dimensional variations.In addition to assembly problems which result in
high labor expenditures and problems relating to gaps in
the assembled seal, a relatively large number of steps
are required during the production and handling of all of
the individual sealing strips, especially when the
individual sealing strips required for a window opening
are different from one
