<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control gear for a fluorescent
lamp, comprising a voltage source and an ignition and supply circuit
comprising an inductive component and a capacitance.Fluorescent lamps are generally used owing to their good lighting
power. In addition, the long operating life of fluorescent lamps and the various
tones of colour available enable their use in various applications.A control gear is required for burning fluorescent lamps, the control
gear supplying the ignition voltage necessary for the fluorescent lamp and the
supply voltage necessary during its use. When using electronic control gears,
a problem arises from the fact that a lamp circuit has very high voltages which
set extremely high demands on the switches used in the lamp circuit. Due to
the high voltage levels, it is possible that the lamp ignites prematurely before
the electrodes of the lamp are heated enough. This may lead to quick wear of
the electrodes and uncertain ignition. In addition, in present prior art solutions,
there are significant problems in the control of the switches in the lamp circuit
and in determining the working condition of the lamp, which are due to said
high voltage levels.When a long ignition durability is required in fluorescent lamps, they
should be ignited so that heating voltage is first switched on in the heater
circuits for approximately one second so that they will reach the temperature
required for a thermal electron emission. Only after this, an ignition voltage is
switched on over the lamp, generating an arc discharge in the filler gas of the
fluorescent lamp.The above-mentioned function can also be performed by preventing
the fluorescent lamp from igniting during preheating by short-circuiting it with a
switch. The conventional use of a series choke and a glow discharge igniter in
50 Hz mains voltage use, for instance, is based on this method.The problem in this case is that the used switch is greatly loaded
due to the high voltages in the lamp circuit. Another drawback in the solution in
question is that the switch over the lamp and its control electronics cannot be
galvanically separated from the high-voltage lamp circuit.The problem in the prior art solutions is also that one can not get
galvanically separated and low voltage measurement information of the 
operation of the lamp. This kind of information is useful in connection with
electronic control gear, so that the gear can be stopped in case of malfunction
of the lamp.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
