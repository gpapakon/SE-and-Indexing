<ABSTRACT>
The invention described above discloses an improved sliding-head screw connection which allows a braking torque to be transmitted by frictional engagement to the hub of the wheel. At the same time, the square sliding-head screws (6) according to the invention centre the friction ring (1) by means of the radially extending fitting grooves (7) of the friction ring. It is thus possible to assume good centring of the friction ring (1) both when the latter is cold and when it is warm. This novel sliding-head screw connection according to the invention permits problem-free installation and removal of the friction ring (1).

<CLAIMS>
Disc brake for rail vehicles, having a sliding head screw connection for securing a 
friction ring (1 ) on a wheel hub (2), the sliding head screws (3) each being capable of 

being pre-stressed by means of a nut (5) and an elastically deformable element (4), 

characterised in that
the sliding head screw (3) has a polygonal cap (6) which is held in a torsion-resistant 
manner by a corresponding radially disposed groove (7) in the 

friction ring (1); 
the threadless shaft of the sliding head screw (3) is guided in a clearance-free 
manner in a bore (8) of the wheel hub (2); and 
the nut (5) can be tightened at the free end of the sliding head screw (3) with 
respect to the wheel hub (2).
