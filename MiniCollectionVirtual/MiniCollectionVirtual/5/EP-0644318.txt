<ABSTRACT>
This variable valve timing gear is suitable for internal combustion engines of the reciprocating piston type, which have inlet and exhaust valves for controlling the exhaust and refill. The inlet and exhaust valves are actuated by a camshaft, which for this purpose has inlet and exhaust cams. For influencing the valve overlap of the inlet and exhaust valves, the inlet and exhaust cams are designed so that they can rotate in opposition to one another, for which purpose an adjusting device is provided. The said adjusting device is provided with an adjusting element, which is arranged axially movably in a bore of the camshaft and, by way of drivers designed as pins and control guides, rotates the inlet cams in relation to the exhaust cams.
