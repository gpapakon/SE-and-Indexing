<ABSTRACT>
A compact and solid-state mechanical sensor 
comprises a magnetic layer having magnetostriction and a 

planar coil for detecting a mechanical property as a change 
in impedance. The sensitivity of the sensor is improved with 

heat treatment to relax the internal stress in the magnetic 
layer. The magnetic layer 12a of 5 µm of thickness is formed 

on a titanium substrate 11 of 9.4 ppm/°C thermal expansion 
coefficient. The magnetic layer comprises an Fe-based 

amorphous alloy film, prepared with a sputtering method, and 
it has a composition or Fe 74, Cr 4, Si 13 and B 9 (at%), +22 

ppm of saturation magnetostriction constant and 8.0 ppm/°C of 
thermal expansion coefficient. An insulator layer 13a made 

or SiO
x
 of 2 µm of thickness on the magnetic layer 12a, and 
a planar coil 14 and input/output terminals 15a, 15b made of 

aluminum of 2 µm of thickness is formed on the insulator layer 
13a. The planar coil 14 is made of a linear conducting line 

having a form wherein a spiral coil is folded as a rectangular 
shape by 90°.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanical sensor according to the preamble of claim 1. Recently, it is required for electronic devices and 
instruments to have a more compact and thinner size. At 
present a mechanical sensor which uses a stress-magnetic 
effect is available practically and it comprises an amorphous 
magnetic alloy ribbon adhered on a cylinder. The alloy has 
a positive saturation magnetostriction constant, and a change 
in magnetic permeability of the ribbon due to applied stress 
is detected with a solenoid coil (refer for example SAE 
TECHNICAL PAPER SERIES 920700). However, the above-mentioned prior art sensor uses 
a coil made of a wire wound like a solenoid and a bulk 
magnetic layer. Therefore, it is difficult to reduce the size 
of a mechanical sensor or to integrate it in a device 
Further, because the thickness of the magnetic layer is as 
large as 20 - 30 µm and the diameter of the wire is as larg 
as 20 - 30 µm, it has an upper limit to be used at higher 
frequencies.  
 Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 013, No. 203 (P-870) of May 15, 1989 (JP-A-01 023 
132) discloses a stress sensor comprising a Ti substrate, an Al coil formed on said 
substrate, a magnetic Fe-Co-Zr magneto-strictive layer surrounded by said Al coil and an 
insulating layer insulating the magnetic layer and the coil. The purpose of the sensor is to 
obtain high sensitivity along with good temperature and response characteristics by 
changing the magnetic permeability of a thin magnetic material film with the distortion by 
the stress of a substrate and detecting the change thereof in the form of inductance. It is the object of the present invention to provide a mechanical sensor having high 
sensitivity. An aspect of this object is to provide a compact mechanical sensor which can 
be easily integrated in a device. This object is attained by the mechanical sensor as defined in claim 1. Suitable and 
preferred embodiments are described in the subclaims.  
 A mechanical sensor according to the present 
invention comprises a coil made of an electrically conductive 
film formed on a substrate, and a magnetic layer which can be 
magnetized by the coil, at least a part of the magnetic layer 
having magnetostriction. A stress σ generated in the magnetic 
layer having magnetostriction is detected as a change of 
impedance. Thus, the mechanical sensor is made compact and can 
be integrated in a device. Further, the sensitivity thereof 
can be enhanced with heat treatment of the magnetic layer 
because soft magnetic
