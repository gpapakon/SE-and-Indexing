<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing a 
finely ground alkaline earth metal pigment. The 

process comprises the steps of: 

(a) preparing an aqueous suspension comprising 
from 40 to 70 % by weight of a particulate alkaline 

earth metal compound, such as calcium carbonate; 
(b) subjecting the suspension formed in step (a) 
to attrition grinding with a particulate grinding 

medium under conditions such as to yield a product 
having a particle size distribution such that at least 

90% by weight of the particles have an equivalent 
spherical diameter smaller than 2µm,
 and preferably at 
least 80% by weight of the particles have an equivalent 

spherical diameter smaller than 1µm; and 
(c) allowing water to evaporate from the 
suspension under the action of heat contained in the 

suspension until the percentage by weight of dry 
alkaline earth metal compound in the suspension has 

increased to at least 70% by weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an improved process for
comminuting in the wet state alkaline earth metal
pigments, in particular, but not exclusively, calcium
carbonate pigments.Hitherto, alkaline earth metal pigments have
generally been comminuted in the wet state either in an
aqueous suspension having a high solids content, for
example from about 70 to 78% by weight of dry solids,
or in an aqueous suspension having a relatively low
solids content, for example less than 40% by weight of
dry solids.The high solids content route has the advantage
that less water is used to suspend the pigment, and
therefore little or no water has to be removed from the
ground pigment for transport and sale. In fact, in
many cases the comminuted pigment is transported and
sold in the form of a concentrated suspension, and this
high solids route produces a suspension which is
directly suitable for this purpose without further
treatment. A dispersing agent for the alkaline earth
metal pigment must be used in this route, and the route
suffers from the disadvantage that a relatively high
proportion of ultra-fine particles, i.e. having an
equivalent spherical diameter smaller than 0.25µm, is
produced which renders the suspension more viscous and
necessitates the use of a larger quantity of the
dispersing agent, or of a dispersing agent which is
specially prepared to yield suspensions of relatively
low viscosity at high solids concentrations, and is
therefore very expensive.The low solids route has the advantage that no
dispersing agent for the pigment is required, but it is
found that the grinding efficiency, as measured in
terms of the increase in the percentage by weight of
the pigment particles having an equivalent spherical 
diameter smaller than, say, 2µm per unit of energy
dissipated in the grinding process, is relatively low.
The route has the further disadvantage that a large
quantity of water has to be separated from the pigment
before the pigment can economically be transported and
sold.GB-A-1309074 describes a process for grinding
calcium carbonate minerals in an aqueous suspension
comprising at least 25% by weight of the mineral. The
suspension preferably contains a dispersing agent.
Following the grinding step, water is removed from the
suspension by means of heating in an oven or with a
conventional spray dryer.EP-A-0027996 describes a process for wet grinding
calcium carbonates with grinding elements of diameter
in the range of 0.5 to 5 mm to produce fine ground
materials. The calcium carbonate is ground in the
absence
