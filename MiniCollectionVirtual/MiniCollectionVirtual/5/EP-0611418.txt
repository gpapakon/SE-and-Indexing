<ABSTRACT>
A plant for recovering energy from waves in motion comprises a wedge-shaped, anchored, self-adjusting towards the waves, floating reception unit (1) placed in the water and having a ramp (3) for the waves and a guide device (4) guiding the water to a reception pipe (8) and into an energy converting engine (9). The guide device comprises a number of reception funnels (4), the cross sections of which are narrowed down in the direction towards the energy converting engine (9). The plant moreover comprises a number of air chambers (16) and side chambers (10) in which the reception pipes (8) end.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a plant for recovering energy from 
waves in motion in the water surface and as presented in 
the preamble of claim 1. A known plant of this type is des ribed in SE publication 
no. 443,026 (corresponding to DE-A-2906724). In principle, this known plant comprises a 
semidomed, bell-like construction floating in the water and 
taking water in at the top. The water is guided to a reception 
pipe which guides the water to a turbine driving a 
generator for electrical energy. The known construction 
also provides the possibility of applying an elongated pipe 
extending parallel with the water surface and having the 
same diameter throughout its length, which pipe ends in a 
diffuser for water outlet. This plant is arranged to float partially submerged and the 
waves are caught by an upwardly-extending tower with openings 
in all directions allowing the water in the waves to 
run through the openings irrespective of the direction of 
the waves in relation to the plant. It is an unfavourable 
construction in respect of energy, as only a small part of 
the waves are caught; consequently, only a part of the wave 
energy is recovered. Besides, this construction has not considered the principle 
that water seeks its own level, as the diffuser of the 
plant is placed in direct continuation of the horisontal 
pipe. A wave passing perpendicularly to this construction 
will stop most of the outlet.  
 The plant according to the invention and with the features 
presented in the characterizing part of claim 1 has the advantage 
that the acquired device concentrates and utilizes 
the energy, i.e. both the kinetic and the potential energy 
in the waves, and guides the caught water to an energy converting 
engine without applying particular movable parts. 
Due to the design of the plant a large amount of water is 
collected currently throughout the length of the device, so 
that maximum energy recovery is achieved. By designing the plant according to the invention as presented 
and characterized in claim 2 it is ensured that the 
plant will not ride the waves, but that the waves will 
break over the plant. By designing the plant according to the invention as presented 
and characterized in claim 3, the water admission 
velocity is increased through the reception funnels, so 
that the water reaches the turbine at an increased speed. By designing the plant according to the invention as presented 
and characterized in claim 4 it is ensured that the 
water does not run out of the reception funnels

<CLAIMS>
Plant for recovering energy from waves in motion in the 
water surface and comprising a wedge-shaped, anchored 

floating reception unit 
(1) placed in the water and having a ramp (3) for the waves 

and a guide device guiding the water to a reception pipe 
(8) and to an energy converting engine (9), 
characterized
 
in that the guide device comprises a number 

of reception funnels (4) for water which funnels are formed 
of a number of shells or plates (12) extending in a curved 

manner so that between them gaps (13) are formed, the cross 
sections of which are narrowed down in the direction towards 

the energy converting engine (9), and that these 
shells or plates at the inlet end form an angle 

substantially corresponding to the expected 
entrance angle of the water, in addition to which the inlet 

edges of the reception funnels are mutually displaced to 
form a steplike configuration placing the lowest positioned 

shell or plate furthest ahead in the direction of inflow. 
Plant according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that it comprises a mooring at the point of the wedge-shaped 

reception device which mooring comprises an anchor 
chain (7) for an anchor (6), the anchor chain having such a 

length that at high water the chain forms an angle of at 
least 60Â° in relation to the horisontal plane. 
Plant according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the plates or shells form reception funnels 
together with vertical partition plates (20) and that 

the walls of these plates curve backwards. 
Plant according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the lower reception funnels have flap valves (18, 

19).  
 
Plant according to claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that reception funnels with flap valves have such valves 

both at the inlet end and at the outlet end. 
Plant according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that at least one of the reception funnels has a reservoir 

chamber (21) with an opening to the surroundings which 
reservoir chamber is open towards the bottom area of the 

reception funnel. 
Plant according to any one of claims 1-6, 
characterized
 in that the reception funnels lead into a 
reception pipe (8) extending backwards in an inclined manner, 

the one end of which is provided with a water turbine 
driving an energy converting engine (9). 
Plant according to any one of claims 1-7, 
characterized
 in that it additionally comprises a shield 
(15) placed behin
d the reception funnels (4) and with a 
height exceeding the height of the funnels above the water 

surface. 
Plant according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that it comprises air chambers (16) at each side of the 

reception pipe (8) and that the one end of the reception 
pipe leads into an outlet chamber (17) partially filled
