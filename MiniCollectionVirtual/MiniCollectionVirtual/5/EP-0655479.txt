<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to a thermal insulation material foam 
useful in a refrigerator, a container and a construction material and, more particularly, to 
a thermal insulation material foam which excludes a foaming agent of CFC-11, to prevent 
the destructurizing of the ozone layer. Active research and study have recently been directed to new refrigerants which 
can be utilized in various fields, such as refrigerators and cooling machines without 
causing environmental problems, especially, destructure of the ozone layer of the 
stratosphere. Thus far, there has extensively been used a freon gas (CFC-11) as a refrigerant. 
Intensive study and observation has revealed that the freon gas, however, is a main factor 
of destructurizing the ozone layer. According to the Montreal protocol internationally 
agreed in 1986, it is prescribed that the freon gas should be prohibited in production and 
use from 1996. Such protocol promotes active research directed to substitute for the freon 
gas or to obtaining desired effect without the freon gas. A thermal insulating material foam usually consists of a polyol, a catalyst, silicon, 
a foaming agent, water and methanediisocyanate (MDI) and, as the foaming agent, there 
is conventionally used CFC-11. Such a typical thermal insulation material foam for refrigerator as is composed of  
 
as mentioned above is an urethane foam. To solve the problems caused by CFC-11 used 
as a foaming agent, there was suggested a foam that was prepared with reduced amount, 
about 50 % of the conventional amount, of the freon gas (CFC-11) by increasing not only 
the amount of water with polyol resulting from amine and polyether but also the amount 
of carbon dioxide. Although the prior art produces the thermal insulation material foam with 
significantly reduced amount of freon gas (CFC-11), there is still used CFC-11 as a 
foaming agent which destructurizes the ozone layer. Consequently, the prior art using 
CFC-11 cannot exclude the destructure of the ozone layer which may bring about an 
effect on a warm of the glove. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to overcome the above problems 
encountered in the prior arts and to provide a thermal insulation material foam without 
CFC-11, capable of basically preventing destruction of the ozone layer with CFC-11. In accordance with the present invention, the above object of the present invention 
could be accomplished by a provision of a thermal insulation material foam employing 
HCFC-141b as a foaming
