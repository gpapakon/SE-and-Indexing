<ABSTRACT>
In known multipoint plugs, the plug housings, which house first electrically conductive contact elements that can be connected to second electrically conductive contact elements of the electrically excitable units, are rigidly connected to the multipoint plug. When the multipoint plug is connected to the electrically excitable units, damage may be caused by relative movement between the electrically conductive contact elements due to shape and position tolerances. In the mew multipoint plug (1), each plug housing (2) is floatingly connected to a central base part of a receiving opening (3) of the multipoint plug (1) so that it can move horizontally and vertically. Relative movement between the first (5) and the second electrically conductive contact elements is thereby compensated and damage prevented. The multipoint plug is particularly designed for common electrical contacting of a plurality of electrically actuated injection valves in internal combustion engines.

Contacting strip for the joint electrical contacting 
of a plurality of electromagnetically actuable 

fuel injection valves of internal-combustion engines, 
having plug housings (2), in which first electrically 

conducting contact elements (5) are fitted and can be 
connected by means of plugs to second electrically 

conducting contact elements (54) of one fuel injection 
valve (53) in each case, each plug housing (2) being 

fitted to the contacting strip (1) in such a way that it 
can be moved with respect to the contacting strip (1) in 

a floating manner in the direction of a plug longitudinal 
axis (25) and in the radial direction with respect 

thereto, characterized in that there is fitted to the 
contacting strip (1) a retaining element (19) which 

engages through a passage opening (26) of the plug 
housing (2) with radial play (42 to 44) and limits by 

means of a head (20), which has an axial spacing (39) 
from the plug housing (2), limits the axial movability of 

the plug housing (2) with respect to the contacting strip 
(1). 
Contacting strip according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the plug housing (2) is held on a central 

base part (29) of a receiving opening (3), designed for 
the reception of the plug housing (2), of the contacting 

strip (1) by means of the retaining element (19) mounted 
in a blind-hole bore (28) of the central base part (29). 
Contacting strip according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the plug housing (2) is inserted into a 

receiving opening (3) fitting around the plug housing (2) 
in the direction of the plug longitudinal axis (25) 

inside the contacting strip (1) and is connected by means 
of a snap or latch connection to the contacting strip 

(1). 
Contacting strip according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that there is formed on the plug 

housing (2) at least one positioning lug (47) which fixes 
the position of the fuel injection valve (53) with 

respect to the plug housing (2) and which extends from  
 

the circumference of the plug housing (2) in the axial 
direction and interacts with at least one recess (55) 

provided on the fuel injection valve (53). 
Contacting strip according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that there is formed on the plug 

housing (2) at least one recess which interacts with at 
least one positioning lug which is formed on the fuel 

injection valve (53) having second electrically conducting 
contact elements. 
Contacting strip according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that, to position the fuel injection 

valve (53) and the plug housing (2), at least two positioning 
lugs (47) and at least two recesses (55) are 

provided which are designed asymmetrically in relation to 
a strip longitudinal axis (46) of the contacting strip 

(1). 
Contacting strip according to one of Claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the first electrically conducting 

contact elements (5) are mounted by latching in plug 
openings (49) of the plug housing (2) by means of latching 

lugs (50) formed on the first electrically conducting 
contact elements (5). 
Contacting strip according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that the contacting strip (1) is made 

of a plastic. 
Contacting strip according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that an electrical conductor (6) connected in an 

electrically conducting manner to the first electrically 
conducting contact elements (5) of the plug housing (2) 

is joined at at least one supporting point (7) of the 
contacting strip (1) to the contacting strip (1) by 

caulking of contacting strip material by means of ultrasonic 
welding. 
Contacting strip according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the contacting strip (1) can be joined to 

the fuel distributor unit (60), in which at least one 
fuel line and valve receiving openings (61) are formed.
