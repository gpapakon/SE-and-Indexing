<ABSTRACT>
An atomic force microscope which is readily 
useable for researchers for its intended use without 

extensive lost time for setup and repair. The probe (10, 
20) used therein is a cantilevered optical lever which 

deflects and therefore imparts surface information in a 
gentle and reliable manner by reflecting an incident laser 

beam (24). The probe is carried by a replaceable probe-carrying 
module (48) which is factory set up and merely 

inserted and fine tuned by the user to align the probe with 
the deflection detection system (24). The piezoelectric 

scan tube (32) employed includes a voltage shield (60) to 
prevent scanning voltages to the tube from affecting data 

readings. Samples (14) are easily mounted, replaced, and 
horizontally adjusted using a sample stage (58) which is 

magnetically attached to the top of the scan tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to scanning microscopes used
for imaging the topography of surfaces and, more
particularly, to an atomic force microscope having
extended use capabilities.The family of scanning probe microscopes that have
been introduced to the scientific community of recent
years is broadening the frontiers of microscopy. As
typified by the greatly simplified general example of
Figures 1 and 2, these microscopes scan a sharp probe 10
over the surface 12 of a sample 14 to obtain surface
contours, in some cases actually down to the atomic scale.
The probe 10 may be affixed to a scanning mechanism and
moved in a scan pattern over the surface 12 or alternately
(and equally effectively because of the small sizes
involved) the probe 10 may be stationary with the sample
14 mounted on a scanning mechanism that moves the surface
12 across the probe 10 in a scanning pattern. The tip 16
of the probe 10 rides over the surface 12 as the probe 10
is moved across it. As the tip 16 follows the topography
of the surface 12, the probe 10 moves up and down as
indicated by the bi-directional arrow 18. This up and
down movement of the probe 10 is sensed to develop a
signal which is indicative of the z directional component
of the 3-dimensional surface 12.Early atomic force microscopes (AFMs) mounted the
probe 10 to a wire and electrically sensed the movement of
the wire as the probe tip 16 moved over the surface 12.
Recent prior art AFMs employ technology developed in the
microelectronics art as depicted in Figure 1. It should
be noted that the drawings figures herein are not to scale
as the probe 10 and its tip 16 (typically of a diamond
material) are extremely small so as to be useful at the
near-atomic level. If the drawings were drawn to scale, 
these components would not be visible. In fact, when
working with AFMs, these components are not visible to the
naked eye and must be viewed with an optical microscope.
As will be seen shortly, this is a source of some of the
problems which are solved by this invention.As depicted in Figure 1, recent prior art AFMs have
the probe 10 extending outward from the forward edge of a
substrate 20 with the probe 10 being formed thereat by
manufacturing techniques which are not critical to the
present invention. It is sufficient to point out that the
probe 10 is typically in the form of an arm extending
outward from the substrate 20 with the diamond tip 16
attached at the end of the arm. Also, the probe 10 is
extremely small and extremely fragile. The substrate 20
is typically
