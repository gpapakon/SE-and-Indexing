<ABSTRACT>
In a linear actuator the drive nut (4) moves inside 
a protective tube (6) which is fitted with limited axial 

play against a spring force in the house (7). Inside 
catches (8) and (9) at the ends of the protective tube 

cause it to be displaced axially when the nut (4) hits 
the ends. By the displacement microswitches (17) and 

(20) are actuated in order that the motor current is 
broken before the screw spindle (3) and/or the drive nut 

(4) are destroyed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a linear actuator comprising
a motor, a screw spindle, a driving nut, a driving
rod connected to the driving nut (4) and a limit switch.Linear actuators are used for exerting linear
forces along a given stroke which is termined by the
maximum travel of the driving nut on the screw spindle.
It is desirable to determine that a limit has been
reached in order to disconnect the drive current,
because otherwise an undesired tightening of the driving
nut might occur which would require a large force to
undo, and furthermore a large increase in the drive
current would take place and overload of the drive
mechanism in general.A known solution to this problem which causes the
interruption of the drive current is to monitor the same
and to switch it off when it reaches an upper limit.
However, this does not prevent the tightening of the nut
mentioned, and the weakness of this solution lies in the
fact that an excess current which would be acceptable to
overcome a resistance in the working range of the
spindle would be above the limit that has to be defined
in order to avoid the tightening of the nut on the
spindle. Another solution uses an electronic counter for
determining the absolute rotation of the screw spindle
and hence the position of the nut, but such a counter is
dependent on an uninterrupted power supply.A further solution is described in closest prior art GB 2 175 710A
which relates to obtaining automatic oscillatory motion
in an apparatus comprising components which effectively
constitute a linear actuator but which is coupled with
limit switches for reversing the polarity in order that
the moveable components oscillate back and forth continuously
as they travel from one limit to the other.
The limit switch itself is controlled by a loosely sliding
rod parallel to the drive screw, which rod is pushed
by the nut when it reaches adjustable stop collars which 
are fitted to the rod. Furthermore a switch is provided
for cutting off entirely the drive current in case the
travel exceeds the limit. This apparatus is a complex
mechanism which is specifically adapted to the needs of
the paper making industry.From FR-A-1 393 860 is known a device for compressing
waste material said device comprising a tubular driving
rod operated by a screw spindle having a nut where the
nut is provided with a radially protruding switch operating
means. This switch operating means on the nut is together
with the switches themselves provided with axially
compressible springs, so as to smoothen the stopping

<CLAIMS>
A linear actuator comprising a motor (1), a screw
spindle (3), a driving nut (4), a driving rod (5) connected

to the driving nut (4) and a limit switch (17,
20), characterized in that internal projections (8, 9) in

a protective tubular housing (6) for the driving rod (5)
constitute catches for the nut (4) in its extreme positions

while one end of the protective tubular housing (6)
operates the limit switch (17, 20).
An actuator according to claim 1, characterized in
that the protective tubular housing (6) is substantially

stationary in the drive position and influenced by a returning
spring force in its extreme positions.
An actuator according to claim 2, characterized in
that the switch (17, 20) is constituted by a pair of microswitches

reversed with respect to each other, where a
chamfered edge (B) of the protective tubular housing (6)

actuates the buttons (18, 19) of the switches in such a
manner that one extrem
e position causes both microswitches
to be actuated and the other extreme positions

causes both microswitches to be non-actuated,
whereby the position of the microswitches controls the

current supply to the motor (1).
