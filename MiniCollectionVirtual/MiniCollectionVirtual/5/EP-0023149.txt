<ABSTRACT>
An optical coating is produced on the undersurface of a 
glass substrate (19) held in a jig (10) rotated within a vacuum-deposition 

chamber, except in an area bounded by line (27) 
and an end plate (16) which is permanently masked. Rotation 

of the jig (10) causes sinusoidal reciprocation of a cam follower 
(26) and an associated masking blade (23) positioned 

close to the undersurface of the substrate (19), a medial band 
of which between lines (27) and (28) is thus masked for a 

period which decreases linearly with distance from the line 
(28). Material is deposited on the unmasked major portion of 

the undersurface of the substrate (19) to form a uniform coating 
and on the differentially masked band to form a graded 

coating, the density of which decreases linearly to zero at the 
line (27).

<DESCRIPTION>

VACUUM-DEPOSITION OF   COATINGS    ONTO SUBSTRATES
This invention relates to a method of, and   apparatus    for, producing on a substrate   n      vacuum-deposited    coating having a non-uniform   thickness    or density; such coatings are sometimes subsequently referred to as '1graded   cotin6sM    and find particular, but not exclusive, application in remedying a defect of   knows    dual combiners.


A combiner is a device used in for example an aircraft and consists essentially of an inclined plate of glass positioned in the line of a pilot's vision so that he can both see through it and also see, reflected from the nearer surface of the plate which is coated with a reflectance   (beam-splitting)    coat   ing,    light projected onto the nearer surface. By means of the virtual image thus created information can be presented to the pilot. If the density of information which can be achieved with a single plate of glass is   inadequate1    as for example in sophisticated fighter aircraft, a second glass   dilate    is used which extends behind only the upper portion of the main plate. Such a combiner is known as a dual combiner.
Because the light reflected from the surface of the second plate has to pass through the upper
Portion of the main plate, the reflectance of the coating on the upper plate is increased so as to be greater   than    that on the lower portion of the main plate, the   runner      nart    of which has an anti-reflectance coating. As there is an abrupt change in the transmittance of a dual combiner at the lower edge of the  second plate due to the change from a single thickness of glass plate to a double thickness and to the difference in the reflectance of the coatings, an artificial horizon is crested at this lower edge.


Such an artificial horizon can clearly lead to pilot error and it has been proposed to overcome the illusion of an artificial horizon by providing at the lower marginal edge portion of the second plate a band of coating whose reflectance decreases to zero at the lower edge itself.   The    corresponding band on the main plate has a coating of decreasing density so that its reflectance decreases to zero at the upper boundary of the band.


Previously graded coatings have been produced by inclining the substrate to a plane normal to the direction of the evaporation source. However this method tends to produce coatings which are irregular due to the difference in the length of the paths   which    have to be covered by the evaporated material.

Claims:



1. A method of producing on a surface of a substrate (19) a vacuum-deposited coating of non-uniform thickness or density characterised in that the period for which said surface is exposed to evaporated material at any particular point is varied depending on the density or thickness of the coating desired at said point.



2. A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein variation of the exposure period is achieved by inducing relative movement between a mask (23) and the substrate (19).



3. A method as claimed in Claim 3,   wherein    said relative movement is reciprocal movement.



4. A method as claimed in Claim 2 or 3, wherein said mask (23) is moved relatively to said substrate (19).



5. A method as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 4, wherein said substrate (19) and mask (23) are both moved relatively to the evaporation source.



6. A method as claimed in any preceding Claim, wherein said period is constituted by an accumulation of exposures of short duration.



7. Apparatus for controlling the thickness or density of a coating being produced on the surface of a substrate (19) by vacuum-deposition characterised in that said apparatus comprises drive means (24, 26) for imparting relative movement between holding means    p .r,m Y      (18) for holding said substrate (19) and masking means (23).

 


8. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7, in which said drive means comprise a cam (24) and a cam follower (26) arranged to impart reciprocal relative movement between said holding means (18) and said masking means (23).



9. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 8, in which said cam (24) is fixed and said cam-follower (25) is arranged to revolve therearound, the arrangement being such that said masking means (23) are caused to revolve with said holding means (18) whilst being reciprocated relatively thereto.



10. Apparatus as claimed in Claim 8 or 9 in which said cam (24) has a sinusoidal profile so that the relative movement has a constant speed and the thickness of the coating deposited on said substrate varies linearly with distance in the direction of relative movement.
