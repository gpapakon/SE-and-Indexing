<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide coated photographic material is disclosed 
comprising sensitized silver bromide or silver bromoiodide tabular 

grains having an average thickness of less than 0.30 µm, in at least 
one light-sensitive layer and which is characterised in that it 

further contains in the said light-sensitive layer and/or at least 
one non-light sensitive layer at least one polyoxyethylene compound 

comprising from about 20 to 100 mole percent recurring units of the 
formula 


and 80 to 0 mole % recurring units of the formula 

and wherein R represents an aliphatic, aromatic, or heterocyclic 
group, and X represents a halogen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tabular grain emulsions suitable for
use in radiographic elements exhibiting reduced dye stain.Tabular grain emulsions have found a wide acceptance in the art
of photography.Tabular grains are herein defined as grains having two substantially
parallel (111) crystal faces, each of which is substantially
larger than any other single crystal face of the grain. The aspect
ratio, that is the ratio of the diameter to thickness of the tabular
grains is substantially greater than two.In a radiographic element, spectrally sensitized tabular grain
emulsions as compared to non-tabular grain emulsions having a
comparable speed (sensitivity) and silver coverage, show an improved
granularity, an increased silver image covering power especially for
strongly hardened layers, a more rapid developability and a decreased
dependence of the photographic results on changes of the processing
temperature.Besides these general advantages tabular grain emulsions, coated
in double side coated radiographic materials, show an improved
speed-cross-over relationship as set forth in US-Patent 4,411,986.Although radiographic elements containing spectrally sensitized
tabular grains have numerous advantages an important disadvantage is
met for tabular grains having a mean grain thickness of less than
0.3 µm in that an increased dye stain of the fully processed radiographic
elements can occur. This dye stain is the result of an
incomplete removement of the spectral sensitizer during processing.
Because of their high surface to volume ratio tabular grains contain
significantly higher amounts of spectral sensitizer per volume of
silver halide to obtain the optimal sensitivity and thus higher
amounts of spectral sensitizer have to be removed.Particularly with relation to recent trends as shorter processing
times to save time, lower regeneration volumes with a composition
that is less threatening the environment, it is important to 
offer suitable films to the customer that are adapted to the new
requirements.Solutions for the increased dye stain after processing have been
described e.g. in EP-Application 426 193 and US-Patent 4,960,683,
wherein thiols, triazolium thiolates, disulphides and thioether
compounds have been added to the processing solutions or to the
photographic material. The addition of products to the layer(s) of
the photographic material that are released during the processing of
the said material are described in US-P 5,108,888.Another solution is offered by the choice of a spectral sensitizing
dye
