<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for exciting a plasma, including at least one electrically conducting filament applicator (3) supplied by an energy source in the microwave range, and means (5) for creating a magnetic field, designed to create at least one surface with constant magnetic field and intensity corresponding to the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR). According to the invention, the filament applicator (3) includes the means (5) for creating the magnetic field, the main component of which lies in a cross-section of the applicator, extending along at least a part of the length of the applicator, the latter constituting an applicator both for a microwave electric field and a static magnetic field.
