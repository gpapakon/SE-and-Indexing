<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a neurostimulator 
according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention refers 
generally to techniques and apparatus for activating 
implanted battery-operated neurostimulators for treating or 
controlling medical, psychiatric or neurological disorders 
by application of modulating electrical signals to a 
selected nerve or nerves of the patient. Extra-physiologic electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve 
for treatment of epilepsy and various forms of involuntary 
movement disorders is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,702,254 to 
J. Zabara, which discloses the features according to the 
preamble of claim 1 of the present invention. An 
implantable neurocybernetic prosthesis (NCP) utilizes 
neurocybernetic spectral discrimination by tuning the 
external current of the NCP generator to the electrochemical 
properties of a specific group of inhibitory 
nerves that affect the reticular system of the brain. These 
nerves are embedded within a bundle of other nerves, and 
are selectively activated directly or indirectly by the 
tuning of the NCP to augment states of brain neural 
discharge to control convulsions or seizures. According to 
the patent, the spectral discrimination analysis dictates 
that certain electrical parameters of the NCP pulse 
generator be selected based on the electrochemical 
properties of the nerves desired to be activated.  
 
An improved implantable neurostimulator has been proposed 
by the applicant. A block diagram of the stimulus generator 
of this neurostimulator is illustrated in Fig. 1, and 
further details of location of an implantable version of 
the device and the associated lead/electrode systeme are  
 
shown in FIG. 2. The implanted device communicates with a 
programmer and/or monitor external to the patient's body by 
means of asynchronous serial communication, to control and 
indicate device states. Stimulus generator 10 is implanted in the body of 
a patient 30 in a surgically-formed pocket immediately 
beneath the skin in the chest (FIG. 2). Housing 21 is 
hermetically sealed and composed of a material biologically 
compatible with the fluids and tissue of the patient's body. 
The neurostimulator also includes implantable stimulating 
electrodes 25 together with a lead system 22 for applying the 
output signal of the stimulus generator to a selected nerve 
such as the patient's vagus nerve 27. Components external 
to the patient's body include a programming wand 33 for 
telemetry of parameter changes to the stimulus generator and 
monitori
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Neurostimulator apparatus for treating and controlling a 
disorder of a patient susceptible to relief in response to 

therapy by predetermined modulation of the electrical 
activity of a selected cranial nerve of the patient, 

including a programmable stimulus generator (10) adapted 
for implantation into the body of the patient and 

including an electrode means (25) connectable to the 
stimulus generator and implantable in the body of the 

patient for electrical interaction with the selected 
nerve, so that the stimulus generator when activated will 

generate an electrical waveform which has been programmed 
with parameter values selected to stimulate the selected 

nerve by delivery via the electrode means to modulate the 
electrical activity of the selected nerve in the 

predetermined manner to alleviate and control the 
disorder, wherein the apparatus includes an activation 

means (50 to 68; 75, 76, 80, 82) adapted to respond to a 
patient initiated signal which may be derived both 

manually and automatically for selectively activating the 
stimulus generator (10), the activation means including a 

motion sensor means (78, 85; 110, 120, 121) responsive to 
violent disorganized movements of the patient associated 

with a seizure of the patient for automatically activating 
the stimulus generator (10), 
characterized in that
 the 
activation means includes a detector (50, 58; 80, 82) 

responsive to tapping by the patient in at least one coded 

sequence of taps on the skin adjacent the implanted 
stimulus generator (10) for manual activation thereof.  

 
The neurostimulator apparatus of claim 1, in which the 
activation means further includes an adjustment means (60, 

67) for varying a preselected parameter of the therapy in 
response to another coded sequence of taps. 
The neurostimulator apparatus of any of the preceding 
claims, in which the activation means further includes a 

deactivating means (65, 67) responsive to another coded 
sequence of taps while the stimulus generator (10) is 

activated for deactivating the electrode means. 
The neurostimulator apparatus of any of the preceding 
claims, in which the activation means further includes a 

delay means (65, 67) responsive to a signal initiated by 
the patient for activating the stimulus generator (10) 

after a predetermined delay interval to cause the delivery 
of the therapy by the electrode means (82), when connected 

to the stimulus generator, to the selected body region and 
thereby to treat the disorder. 
The neurostimulator apparatus of claim 1, in which the 
activation means includes sensitivity means (80) for 

determining the violence of the disorganized movements 
associated with a seizure of the patient. 
The neurostimulator apparatus of claim 5, in which the 
motion sensor means (85, 110, 120, 121, 122) produces an 

electrical signal indicative of frequency of movements by 
the patient, and the sensitivity means includes an 

electrical signal filter (112) for limiting the electrical 
signal to a predetermined frequency band.  

 
The neurostimulator apparatus of claim 6, in which the 
motion sensor means (85) produces an electrical signal 

indicative of the frequency of making and breaking of 
electrical contacts in response to movements by the 

patient, and the sensitivity means includes a counter (84) 
to ascertain the number of contacts made during a 

predetermined interval of the movements. 
The neurostimulator apparatus of claim 1, in which the 
activation means comprises a device (75) adapted to be 

worn externally by the patient including manual signalling 
means (82) for producing a signal in the audio or 

ultrasonic frequency range. 
The neurostimulator apparatus of claim 8, in which the 
external device is a bracelet (75) which further includes 

sensing means (78) responsive to a physiological

activation means further includes receiving means (80) 

located within a housing for the activation means and 
responsive to the signal produced by the sensing means 

(78) for ascertaining whether the signal is indicative of 
a physiological manifestation of the disorder being 

treated in contrast to a physiological manifestation of a 
normal reaction, and for limiting activation of the 

stimulus generator (81) in response to only a 
physiological manifestation of the disorder being treated. 
The neurostimulator apparatus of claim 10, further 
including means adapted to be located external to the 

patient for selectively adjusting the sensitivity of the
