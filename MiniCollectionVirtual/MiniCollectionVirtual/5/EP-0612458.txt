<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a video recording and playback
technology. More particularly, the invention relates to data formats for optical writing
and reading of data with respect to a storage medium such as a flexible optical tape.Presently, flexible tape for optical storage of data is known, as described in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,719,615 and 4,912,696, both identified on their faces as being assigned to
Optical Data, Inc. To optically record data on a medium such as a flexible optical tape,
a beam of laser light is directed onto the tape. The laser beam melts the tape or burns
holes in the tape to produce data spots representing bits of data. The data spots have a
reflectivity, transmissivity or other optical characteristic which can be distinguished from
the background of the optical tape.Optically sensitive tape has not been effectively used to record high bandwidth
signals. Thus, the commercial potential of optical tape to record signals such as television
picture signals has not been effectively exploited.Generally speaking, television pictures are comprised of snapshot-like "frames"
that contain video signal information in horizontal scan lines organized by synchronizing
signals. For example, according to the standards of the National Television Systems
Committee (NTSC), each frame of video information comprises 525 horizontal scan lines.
Further according to NTSC standards, the frame repetition rate is thirty frames per
second, or 15,750 horizontal scan lines per second.In practice, all of the video information in a complete television frame is not
reproduced at a receiver simultaneously; instead, a technique known as interlaced
scanning is used to reduce flicker. In interlaced scanning, each frame of video
information is divided into two interlaced fields, each comprising a raster array of
odd-numbered or even-numbered horizontal scan lines. Thus, if the horizontal scan lines
of a 525-line NTSC frame were numbered sequentially from the top of a raster array, an
odd-line field would comprise numbered horizontal scan lines 1, 3, 5, and so forth
through frame line 525. Similarly. an even-line field would include numbered lines 2, 4,
and so forth through line 524. According to the NTSC format, the field repetition rate 
is sixty fields per second.In video recording systems that employ magnetic videotape as the recording
medium, it is conventional to record each television field by using only a single
track on the recording medium. This single track is traced by a recording head
which

A method for storing digital video information on an optical recording tape,
the method comprising the steps of:


storing first information with a first frequency bandwidth in a first portion
of a scan trace on the optical recording tape; and
storing second information with a second frequency bandwidth
lower than the first frequency bandwidth in a second portion of said scan trace

adjacent to said first portion, the method being characterised in that said scan trace
is a generally sinusoidal trace pattern for storing the first information on relatively

linear portions of the trace, which portions are substantially perpendicular to
longitudinal edges of the tape, and for storing said second information on relatively

non-linear portions of the trace.

information further comprises the step of:


scanning at a speed relative to the recording tape speed which permits audio
signal information associated with an audio signal to be stored during consecutive

scan cycles.
