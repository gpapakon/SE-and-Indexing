<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are radiation-crosslinkable elastomeric compositions containing: (a) an elastomeric polymer containing abstractable hydrogen atoms in an amount sufficient to enable the elastomeric polymer to undergo crosslinking in the presence of a suitable radiation-activatable crosslinking agent; and (b) a radiation-activatable crosslinking agent of formula (1), wherein: W represents -O-, -N-, or -S-; X represents CH3- or (2), Y represents a ketone, ester , or amide functionality; Z represents on organic spacer which does not contain hydrogen atoms that are more photoabstractable than hydrogen atoms of the elastomeric polymer; m represents an integer of 0 to 6; a represents 0 or 1; and n represents an integer of 2 or greater. Radiation-crosslinked elastomers are prepared by exposing the radiation-crosslinkable elastomeric compostitions to radiation (e.g., UV light) to abstract hydrogen atoms from the elastomeric polymer by the resulting radiation-activated crosslinking agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to radiation-crosslinkable elastomeric compositions 
which employ a radiation-activatable crosslinking agent. This invention also relates 
to radiation crosslinked elastomeric compositions. It is known that crosslinking of polymers produces polymer networks which 
have quite different mechanical and physical properties compared to their 
uncrosslinked linear or branched counterparts. For example, polymer networks can 
show such unique and highly desirable properties as solvent resistance, high cohesive 
strength, and elastomeric character. Crosslinked polymers can be made in situ during formation of the desired 
polymer product, however, since further processing of the polymer product is often 
necessary, it is more typical to start from the linear or branched polymer which in the 
final processing step is cured to a crosslinked material. The curing or crosslinking 
step is typically activated by moisture, thermal energy, or radiation. The latter has 
found widespread applications, particularly in the use of ultraviolet light as the 
radiation source. In the past, a variety of different materials have been used as crosslinking 
agents, e.g. polyfunctional acrylates, acetophenones, benzophenones, and triazines. 
The foregoing crosslinking agents, however, possess certain drawbacks which include 
one or more of the following: high volatility; incompatibility with certain polymer 
systems; generation of corrosive or toxic by-products; generation of undesirable 
color; requirement of a separate photoactive compound to initiate the crosslinking 
reaction; and high sensitivity to oxygen. Certain polyfunctional benzophenones have been investigated as 
photocrosslinking agents and/or photosensitizers in various photopolymerizable 
systems.  
 JP 54/057560 discloses the use of (bis)benzophenone compounds to 
photocrosslink non-elastomeric materials -- in particular, polyester compositions. 
When incorporated into polyesters, they impart improved tensile strength and 
elongation to biaxally stretched films of crosslinked poly(ethylene terephthalate). 
These films also exhibit enhanced weather, heat, and chemical resistance and 
improved dimensional stability. U.S. Pat. No. 4,602,097 (Curtis) discloses the use of (bis)benzophenones as 
photoinitiators and/or photosensitizers in radiation cured coatings. The poly(ethylene 
oxide) moiety which separates the terminal benzophenone groups allows the claimed 
compositions to be more soluble than unsubstituted benzophenones in waterborne 
coating
