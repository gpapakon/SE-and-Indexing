<ABSTRACT>
The high-frequency transmission cable comprises insulated conductors combined into bundles, themselves being combined into at least one assembly, and an external overall protective jacket. It is characterised in that it furthermore comprises a longitudinally grooved dielectric keeper (former) (5) for combining the bundles of each assembly, the grooves (6) of which are opened via a slit (7) on each of them and hold the individual bundles (1) in place, separating them from each other. Application: Computer cable.

<CLAIMS>
A high frequency transmission cable comprising individually
insulated electric conductors (2) assembled together in a plurality

of bundles (1) that are themselves assembled together in at least one
unit, a dielectric rod (5) for assembling together the bundles in

each unit, and an overall protective outer sheath (10), said
dielectric rod including joined tubular portions defining firstly

independent longitudinal cavities (6) assigned to the bundles of the
same unit, each of section adapted to the section of the

corresponding one of the bundles and each provided with a slot (7) on
the periphery of the rod for installing the bundle in the cavity, and

secondly at least one "spacer" zone common to the tubular portions
between the bundles installed in the cavities, the cable being

characterized in that it includes an element (8) for keeping closed
said slots of the various cavities containing the bundles, for

continuity of dielectric material around the bundles installed in
said cavities and to conserve the shape of said installed bundles.
A cable according to claim 1, characterized in that each spacer is
substantially plane over the corresponding peripheral portions of

said rod.
A cable according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said rod
is of substantially elliptical right cross-section and includes two

cavities (6) opposite one another and centered on the major axis of
the right cross-section of said rod, with the respective slots

thereof being located at the ends of said major axis.
A cable according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that between the bundles held in their cavities, each spacer has a

minimum thickness of not less than 0.2 mm, and preferably lying in
the range 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm.
A cable according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in
that said slots have a width that is less than a few tenths of a

millimeter, and that is preferably of the order of a few hundredths
of a millimeter. 
A cable according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in
that said element (8) for keeping each of the slots of the various

cavities containing said bundles closed is a screen surrounding each
rod and having margins which overlap mutually and which are offset

from the slots.
A cable according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the bundles of each unit are constituted by two to four twisted-together

conductors that are thus held directly in the various
cavities.
A cable according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that it includes a plurality of rods for assembling together bundles

into a corresponding number of units, said rods being disposed and
held side by side inside said outer sheath (10).
