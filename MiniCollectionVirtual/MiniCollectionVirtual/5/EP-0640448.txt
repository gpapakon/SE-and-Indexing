<ABSTRACT>
A pre-preg pre-cut tape 20 is made by the steps of 
converting the forms of a pre-preg to be cut into 

co-ordinates on a pre-preg tape 2 from the data on the form 
of lamination and the condition of lamination to form the 

data on the form to be cut, forming the data on the forms 
of unnecessary portions showing the forms of the 

unnecessary portions 4 from the data on the forms to be 
cut, forming the data on division for dividing the forms of 

the unnecessary portions into the forms of (a) to (f) 
removable from a mold releasing paper, and forming the data 

on the direction of removal for showing the direction of 
removing the unnecessary portions of (a) to (f) divided on 

the basis of the data on division, whereby the unnecessary 
portions 4 are removed on the basis of such data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and an apparatus 
for making a pre-cut pre-preg tape. Parts for aircraft, a wide variety of machine 
structural uses, sport and leisure articles and the like 
have been produced from composite materials. In this case, 
the composite material used is produced in such a manner 
that thermosetting resin or thermoplastic resin is 
impregnated into reinforced fiber such as carbon fiber, 
aramid fiber, boron fiber, glass fiber or the like to 
thereby prepare pre-pregs, which are in turn laminated with 
the orientation thereof being changed in every layer 
(hereinafter referred to as "a pre-preg laminated sheet"). 
This pre-preg laminated sheet is cut to the form adapted 
for a product to be produced, and a piece of the cut 
pre-preg laminated sheet (hereinafter referred to as "a 
pre-preg laminated material") is pressed and heated to 
provide it with a predetermined shape. In the case where such a pre-preg laminated sheet 
is produced in the prior art, a method is adopted which 
comprises preparing a pre-preg tape by previously spreading 
the pre-preg on a flexible tape onto which silicon 
impregnation treatment is carried out on its one 
surface (hereinafter referred to as "a mold releasing 
paper"), mounting the pre-preg tape on a pre-preg 
laminating means, and continuously orienting the pre-preg 
while delivering the pre-preg tape in order. Figs. 4 and 5 show an example of producing a 
pre-preg laminated sheet 1 using the pre-preg tape. In the 
case where a square pre-preg laminated sheet 1 is formed by 
orienting pre-pregs 12 in the direction of 45° and setting 
them, as shown in Fig. 4, if the pre-pregs 12 to be applied 
are deployed in order of being set, it becomes the 
arrangement as partially shown in Fig. 5. Hereupon, the  
 
portions 3 (shown with dots) on the pre-preg tape 2 
are necessary pre-pregs corresponding to the pre-pregs 12 
to be applied, as shown in Fig. 4. On the other hand, the 
portions 4 (without dots) are 
unnecessary portions of the pre-pregs (unnecessary 
pre-pregs). It is preferable to keep the unnecessary 
pre-pregs 4 separated from the pre-preg tape 2 in order to 
continuously orient the pre-pregs using the pre-preg 
laminating means. Heretofore, as an apparatus for making a pre-cut 
pre-preg tape 20 obtained by removing the unnecessary 
pre-pregs 4 from the pre-preg tape 2, is proposed a method 
and apparatus described in J.P.A Hei-4-122611 
(see also DE-A-4 130 269). In such 
conventional method and apparatus, only the pre-pregs are 
cut
