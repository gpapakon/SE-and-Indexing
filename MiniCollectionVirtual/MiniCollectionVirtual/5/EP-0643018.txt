<ABSTRACT>
To clarify waste waters (effluents) by the aerobic/facultative principle, the waste water to be purified is charged into the vessel (1.0) of a clarifying reactor (1). During a first time period, a circular flow is then generated in the vessel (1.0). For this purpose, using a pump (2.0), the waste water is removed by suction from a take-off chamber (1.6) beneath the bottom (1.1) of the vessel (1.0) and transported via pipes (2.1, 2.2, 2.4) to a water-jet gas pump (2.6), where, via a gas line (3), gas, in particular air, is added distributed very finely. The waste water/gas mixture is passed through further pipes (2.7) below the bottom (1.1) of the vessel (1.0) and forced into the vessel (1.0) through an outlet tube (2.12). Above the outlet tube (2.12) there is mounted in the vessel a jet tube (1.2) designed as a submerged tube. By means of the airlift pump thus formed, waste water, sewage sludge and - if present - growth bodies (4) for sessile microorganisms are set into an intensive circulatory flow. A sensor (5.1) measures the oxygen saturation of the waste water and controls the rotary speed of the pump (2.0) via a control unit (5.0).
