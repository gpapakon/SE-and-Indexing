<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for operating an exhaust-gas probe having a pumped reference atmosphere in a relatively sealed volume, the oxygen-ion flow carrying the pumping flow Ip is temporarily increased with respect to the reference atmosphere under defined conditions. As a result of this, vitiation of the reference atmosphere, as may be caused by fuel particles diffusing in, is more quickly eliminated.

<CLAIMS>
Method for operating an exhaust gas probe (1)
having


an oxygen ion conducting solid electrolyte (2)
which has at least
a measurement electrode (3) exposed to a test
gas and
a reference electrode (4) exposed to a
reference gas, the reference gas forming an

internal reference in the sense that it is
sealed off from the test gas and from the

surroundings such that an exchange of particles
between the reference gas atmosphere and test

gas and/or surrounding is at least impeded,
there being applied to the measurement and
reference electrodes (3, 4) a voltage whose

magnitude and direction are predetermined such
that there flows between the measurement and

reference electrodes (3, 4) a pumping current
(Ip) which transports oxygen ions from the

measurement electrode (3) to the reference
electrode (4) without the action of the

permanently applied voltage leading to
decomposition of the electrolyte (2),
characterized in that
 the pumping current (Ip)
is increased, 
that the time integral of the pumping current
(Ip) is compared with a prescribed threshold

value (NO), and
in that
 a reduction of the pumping current (Ip)
is undertaken in the event of overshooting of

the threshold value (NO),
the threshold value (NO) being fixed at a value
upon overshooting of which decomposition of the

electrolyte (2) occurs.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the increase in the pumping current (Ip) is
triggered after each start of an internal

combustion engine or after expiry of a prescribed
operating period of the internal combustion engine

and/or in specific operating states of the
internal combustion engine.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that

the increase in the pumping current (Ip) is
triggered when a lowering of the output voltage

(Us) of the exhaust gas probe (1) indicates a
falsified reference atmosphere.
Method according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that

the increase in the pumping current (Ip) is
triggered whenever the output voltage of the

exhaust gas probe (1) does not cross at least once
a prescribed threshold value (SW1) within a

prescribed time interval.
Method according to at least one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the time integral of
the pumping current (Ip) is coordinated with the

magnitude of the reference gas volume.
