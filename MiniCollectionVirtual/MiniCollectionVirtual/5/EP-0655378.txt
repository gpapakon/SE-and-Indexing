<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for steering wheels (4), in particular wheel sets (1, 1'), of a rail vehicle with a device (6), for example at least one spring, for producing a restoring force counter to the steering lock of the wheels (4) or wheel sets (1,1') occurring when travelling through a bend in the track, in addition an apparatus (7) is provided for producing a counter force which is dependent on the radius of the bend in the track and acts counter to the restoring force. As a result, very good steering behaviour of the wheel sets (1, 1') is easily achieved when going through a bend and as a result a low degree of wear and stable straight-ahead travel with a high limit speed is achieved.
