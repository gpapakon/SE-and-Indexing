<ABSTRACT>
Novel porous copolymers are disclosed which can be used to prepare ion-exchange resins and polymeric adsorbents. The copolymers comprise a copolymer of at least one monovinylidene monomer and a crosslinking monomer and have a unique cellular pore structure. The cellular structure comprises a macroporous void phase which is dispersed within a continuous copolymer phase. The porous void phase comprises a plurality of cellular void spaces which are at least partially enclosed by walls of the continuous copolymer phase. Also disclosed are processes which can be used to prepare the porous copolymers, as well as ion-exchange resins and polymeric adsorbents using the porous copolymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns polymers suitable for use in making polymeric
adsorbents and ion-exchange resins. More particularly, the invention concerns porous
polymers having a unique cellular polymeric structure.Ion-exchange resins are used by industry to separate chemical species from
solutions containing them. Such resins are prepared by substituting various types of functional
groups onto a crosslinked polymer matrix. The functional groups are capable of associating
with chemical species so as to remove them from solution. Ion-exchange resins may be cation-,
anion-, or chelate-exchange resins, depending on the choice of functional group substituted
onto the copolymer matrix. The polymer matrix may also be used in preparing polymeric
adsorbents, such as the post-crosslinked adsorbent resins disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,950,332.The polymer matrix is typically in spheroidal bead form and is generally prepared
by suspension polymerization of a finely divided organic phase within a continuous suspending
medium. The organic phase comprises monovinylidene monomers like styrene, polyvinylidene
monomers like divinylbenzene and a free-radical polymerization initiator. The copolymer
beads produced may be microporous, i.e., gel in character, or macroporous, depending upon
whether a phase-separating diluent is added to the organic phase. The term "macroporous"
refers to the fact that the copolymer has both macropores and and micropores. The terms
"microporous," "gel," and "macroporous" are well known in the art and generally describe
the nature of the copolymer bead porosity. Microporous copolymer beads have pore sizes on
the order of 50 Angstroms (Å) (5nm) or less, while macroporous copolymer beads have macropores of
100 Å (10 nm) or greater. Gel and macroporous copolymer beads, as well as their preparation, are
further discussed in U.S. Patent 4,256,840.Adsorbent resins based on a post-crosslinked, gel copolymer matrix can be
difficult to manufacture as the gel copolymer is, in many instances, susceptible to breakage
during the post-crosslinking step employed. Conventional macroporous copolymers generally
have better strength relative to gel copolymers and, as a result, are less susceptible to such
breakage. However, adsorbent resins derived from such conventional macroporous
copolymers may have less adsorption capacity relative to the gel adsorbent resin due to a
higher degree of porosity, or void space.US-A-4501826, GB-A-2210886, GB-A-754522 and DD-A-249274 describe cellular resins.While U.S. Patent
