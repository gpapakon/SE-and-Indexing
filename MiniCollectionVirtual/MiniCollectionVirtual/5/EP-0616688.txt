<DESCRIPTION>
This patent relates to pressure sensor transducers 
having diaphragms responsive to changes in pressure. 
The invention is of particular diaphragm formations 
and processes for producing them. Also described are 
multi-diaphragm chips with diaphragms for absolute 
pressure measurements and others for differential 
pressure measurements on the same substrate. Current devices are able to provide good 
estimates of "absolute" pressure and good measures of 
differential pressure, but not at the same place. 
Currently, two separate pressure sensors are used in 
these situations. In situations where two sensors 
could be employed to monitor the pressure of a 
process, a single absolute pressure sensor combined 
with a differential pressure sensor at a nearby but 
different location may yield satisfactory results, but 
at a substantially higher cost than two sensors at one 
location. Every fixture associated with a high 
pressure process must be carefully designed into the 
process so as not to either disrupt it or cause a leak 
or loss of pressure. Economic justification for a 
chip containing both an absolute and differential 
pressure sensor is therefore quite easy to see where 
process pressures are about 2.10⁷ Pa (3,000 psi) or greater, 
where the differential pressure needing to be measured 
is on the order of 7.10⁴ - 1.10⁵ Pa (10-15 psi). Of course, the 
invention herein has wider applicability than simply  
 
to measure pressures on the order of 7.10⁴ - 1.10⁵ Pa (10-15 psi) in an 
absolute pressure range of approximately 2.10⁷ Pa (3,000 psi), 
however, the economic justification for use of the 
invention is well founded in those ranges. Using polycrystalline silicon long rectangular 
diaphragms, it has been found that lengthwise 
piezoresistive elements mounted thereon can produce 
repeatedly accurate indications of pressures in large 
(or overpressure) pressure ranges. For example, using 
a process as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,592,238 or 
something similar, a pair of references (Gückel and 
Burns, DOCTORAL THESIS Micromechanics of Integrated 
Sensors and the Planar Processed Pressure Transducer, 
May 1988, and HIGH-STRESS AND OVERRANGE BEHAVIOR OF 
SEALED-CAVITY POLYSILICON PRESSURE SENSORS, Chau, et 
al, IEEE Solid-state Sensor And Actuator Workshop, 
June 4, 1990) have shown that aspect ratios of 3 to 1 
would provide sufficient length for piezoresistive 
strip elements to generate repeatably measurable 
signals of appropriate size for such very high 
pressure conditions. These papers did not
