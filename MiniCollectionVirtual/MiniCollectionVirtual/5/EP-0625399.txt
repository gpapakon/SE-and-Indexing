<ABSTRACT>
The machine consists of a rotationally driven work holder (2) and a rotationally driven tool holder (6) which is fitted with a fly cutter (7) for the undercuts (8) and with a fly cutter (9), axially and radially offset from the fly cutter (7), for the pockets (10) and which can be offset with its rotation axis (D2) with regard to the rotation axis (D1) of the work holder (2). In this arrangement, the rotational movements of work holder (2) and tool holder (6) can be matched to one another in such a way that, when the fly cutter (7) for the undercuts (8) is in the working position, the fly cutter (7) describes an open hypocycloidal path and, when the fly cutter (9) for the pockets (10) is in the working position, the fly cutter describes a closed hypocycloid.

A fly cutter milling machine for making undercuts (8) in
the tooth flanks of sliding sleeves (4) for shift

transmissions and pockets (10) in the gear shift sleeves
(4), comprising a rotatably driven workpiece holder (2) and

a rotatably driven tool holder (6), which is equipped with
a fly cutter (7) for the undercuts (8) and a fly cutter (9) for the

pockets (10) which is disposed axially and radially offset in relation
to the first-mentioned fly cutter and whose axis of

rotation (D
2
) can be offset in relation to the axis of
rotation (D
1
) of the workpiece holder (2), the rotary
movements of the workpiece holder (2) and the tool holder

(6) being so adaptable to one another that when the fly
cutter (7) for the undercuts (8) is in the operational

position the fly cutter (7) describes a hypocycloidal path,
and when the fly cutter (9) for the pockets (10) is in the

operational position the fly cutter describes a closed
hypocycloid.
