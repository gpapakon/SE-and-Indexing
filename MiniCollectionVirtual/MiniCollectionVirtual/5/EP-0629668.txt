<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of a copper phthalocyanine 
pigment composition comprising from 70 to 99 % by weight of a 

crude copper phthalocyanine and 30 to 1 % by weight of at least 
one phthalocyanine derivative, the process comprising dry 

milling all of the crude copper phthalocyanine and the 
phthalocyanine derivative in an amount of 0.5 to 10 % by weight 

of a final composition in the absence of a milling auxiliary 
until the content of an α-form phthalocyanine in the crude 

copper phthalocyanine is at least 20 % by weight, and adding 
and mixing the remaining phthalocyanine derivative to/with the 

dry-milled product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the
production of a copper phthalocyanine pigment composition by
a dry milling method. More specifically, it relates to a
process for the production of a pigment composition, which
comprises dry milling a crude copper phthalocyanine and a
phthalocyanine derivative in the absence of a milling
auxiliary and further mixing a phthalocyanine derivative
with the milled product, and which shows stability with time
when dispersed in a non-aqueous vehicle and shows less
"strike-through" when used as an ink.A finely milled copper phthalocyanine has
excellent fastness, a clear color tone and a high tinting
strength, and it is hence widely used for various purposes
in the industrial field of coloring materials. Since,
however, a crude copper phthalocyanine produced by a general
synthesis reaction is in the form of coarse crystal
particles having a diameter of 1 to several tens µm, it is
well known that such a crude copper phthalocyanine has
insufficient pigment properties such as the tinting
strength, hue, etc. which are required of pigments. For
this reason, there are a variety of methods employed for
converting it to a useful pigment form by finely milling a
crude copper phthalocyanine to a size of approximately 0.01
to 0.5 µm.For obtaining a fine α-form pigment, there are a
method in which a crude copper phthalocyanine is dissolved
in concentrated sulfuric acid (acid pasting method) and a 
method in which a sulfuric acid salt is formed (acid slurry
method). However, both these methods are industrially
undesirable due to the use of a large amount of sulfuric
acid and water and in view of the treatment of waste water.
Further, the method for obtaining a fine β-form pigment is
largely classified into (i) a dry milling method in which a
crude copper phthalocyanine is milled in the presence of a
milling auxiliary such as anhydrous sodium ferrocyanide or
anhydrous barium chloride or a crude copper phthalocyanine
is milled in the presence of a milling auxiliary and an
organic liquid and then treated with an organic solvent and
(ii) a wet milling method in which a crude copper
phthalocyanine is milled with a mixing device (kneader) in
the presence of a milling auxiliary such as sodium chloride
and an organic liquid such as an alcohol or polyol.
However, all of these methods require various steps and a
large amount of energy, and are hence industrially
undesirable.Further, α-form and β-form copper phthalocyanines
obtained by the above methods have another problem in that
