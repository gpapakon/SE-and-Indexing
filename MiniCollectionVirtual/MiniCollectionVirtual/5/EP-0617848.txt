<ABSTRACT>
An appropriate electrochemical process is disclosed for rechargeable batteries and/or cell packages, in particular zinc/bromine cells, with circulating, for example pumped, electrolytes, and having bipolar electrodes interconnected in series, and diaphragms arranged therebetween, forming anolyte or catolyte chambers that are interconnected in parallel and through which flow at least partially the corresponding electrolytes. Electrically controlled working means, for example displacement motors, and electric control and/or checking means are connected to the battery. When the electrolytes are not circulating and the working means are electrically switched off, the control and/or checking means are also switched off, and/or when the electrolytes are not circulating and the working means are electrically switched off, the battery and/or cell packages are at least temporarily charged.

A process for a purposive electrochemical conversion in 
rechargeable batteries and/or cell bundles, in particular 

comprising zinc/bromine cells, with circulating, e.g. pumped 
electrolytes, series-connected bipolar electrodes, 

diaphragms arranged between the latter, and thus formed 
anolyte- and catholyte chambers which, in each case at least 

partially connected in parallel, are traversed by the 
corresponding electrolytes, where electrically operable 

operating means, e.g. motors for mobile use, and electrical 
control- and/or monitoring elements are connected to the 

battery, characterised in that when the electrolyte(s) 
is(are) not circulating and when the operating means are 

electrically disconnected the control- and/or monitoring 
elements are likewise disconnected and/or when the 

electrolyte(s) is(are) not circulating and when the 
operating means are electrically disconnected the battery 

and/or cell bundles is/are at least periodically charged. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that 
the electrolyte containing the oxidized anion, in particular 

bromine, is periodically circulated also when the operating 
means are disconnected. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that different pressures are built up in the anolyte- and 

catholyte cycle. 
A process as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the maximum pressure in the anolyte- and/or 

catholyte cycle is controlled. 
A process as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the pressure in the anolyte- and/or  

 
catholyte cycle is controlled by controlling the rotation 

speed of pumps and operating means. 
A process as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the pressure of the electrolyte 

cycle(s) is controlled by flow restrictors, which optionally 
simultaneously serve as static mixing element, in the 

pipelines. 
A process as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that for the rest state of the operating 

means, with the batteries and/or cell bundles electrically 
connected in parallel, the electrical connection is at least 

partially interrupted, and for the operation of the 
operating means the circuit(s) is/are closed again. 
A process as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that for the rest state of the operating 

means an electrolyte low in the electrochemically active 
element, molecule and/or compound, in particular low in 

bromine, is introduced into the anolyte chambers. 
A process as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that for the rest state of the operating 

means the electrical connection between the electrolyte 
chambers via the electrolyte supply- and discharge pipelines 

is interrupted.
