<ABSTRACT>
A double reach platten assembly for a side reach crane or truck of a warehouse racking system can reach to a first row of pallets (18) or past the first pallet positions to a second row of pallets (18) in the warehouse. Selective control of advancement of intermediate platten sections (30) and of distal platten sections (34) ensures that for either pallet position the intermediate sections (30) can be advanced towards the pallet without fouling an associated front racking beam, while the distal platten sections (34) continue their extension into the fork cavity. Advantageously load centralizing means are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to adouble reach platten assembly 
for a side reach crane or truck of a warehouse racking 
system as set out in the preamble of claim 1. Such a platten assembly can pick up pallets from 
either side of a warehouse aisle, and can reach laterally 
to a first row of pallets immediately alongside the aisle 
or to a second row of pallets spaced from the aisle 
behind the first row. The platten arms of such a double 
reach platten assembly are telescopic to maximum reach, 
and must be able to resist the large cantilever stresses 
imposed on them when they are supporting a pallet 
laterally at maximum extension. Double reach platten assemblies of the above kind are known, 
and generally each platten arm comprises three or more 
telescopically extensible elements. Such a platten assembly 
is shown in French Patent Application FR-A-2520716. A constant 
ratio coupling or gearing has always governed the 
extension of those elements, so that when the platten 
arms are laterally extended to their far reach positions 
to pick up a pallet from the row distant from the aisle 
(a rear pallet position), all elements of each  
 
telescopically assembled platten arm are fully extended. On the other hand if the platten assembly were only 50% 
extended, to pick up a pallet from near the aisle (a 
front pallet position), then each element of each platten 
arm would be only 50% extended. If each platten arm is considered as comprising a base 
portion, an intermediate portion (or two or more 
intermediate portions) and a distal portion, then it will 
readily be seen that if the distal portions are at their 
maximum extension from the intermediate portions for the 
far reach or rear pallet pick up position, then they will 
be only 50% extended from the intermediate portions for 
the near reach or front pallet pick up position. That 
means that for penetration of the distal portions fully 
into a fork cavity of a pallet in the front pallet 
position, the intermediate portions themselves must 
extend approximately 50% into that fork cavity. As these 
intermediate portions have to be thicker, this is 
conventionally accommodated by providing front to back 
spacer bars on top of the warehouse racking beams of the 
front pallet positions, so that each pallet placed at 
those front positions is supported above the racking 
beams by a discrete distance sufficient to accommodate 
the intermediate platten sections between the underside 
of the pallet board and the racking beams. Such 
spacers, however, are expensive
