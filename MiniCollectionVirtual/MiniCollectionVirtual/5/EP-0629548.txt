<ABSTRACT>
It is a requirement to create an arrangement for recovering energy on board an aircraft, which arrangement makes the cabin outlet airflow, which contains a high level of thermal energy, effectively usable before it emerges into the aircraft environment and thus improves the overall efficiency of the aircraft. Such an arrangement consists essentially of an energy conversion unit (8) which is connected to a cabin outlet air line (2), and of a tapping air extraction point (10a) for tapped air (11) from an engine (10) in order to use said air in the air-conditioning system (12), the tapped air extraction point (10a) being connected to the air-conditioning system (12) via a tapped air line (3). A heat exchanging device (4) is arranged at a suitable point between the cabin outlet air line (2) and the tapped air line (3). It is advantageous that the thermal energy emitted by the heat carrier to the cabin outlet air is made usable and is not emitted to the environment without being used.

Arrangement for obtaining energy on board an aircraft, in 
particular a passenger aircraft, with a cabin outgoing 

air line (2) in which there flows a cabin outgoing air 
stream (5) which is connected, on the one hand, to a 

pressurized cabin (6) in the aircraft and on the other 
hand to the aircraft environment (7), with a tapped air 

bleeder (10a) on the engine side which is connected via a 
tapped air line (3) to air-conditioning equipment (12), 

and the engine tapped air (11) is suitable for further 
use thereof in the air-conditioning equipment (12), with 

a heat exchanger (4) which is arranged between cabin 
outgoing air line (2) and tapped air line (3) in such a 

way that the cabin outgoing air stream (5) has a low 
temperature before it enters the heat exchanger (4) and 

the engine tapped air (11) has a high temperature in 
order to cool the engine tapped air (11) before it enters 

the air-conditioning equipment (12), and with an energy 
converting unit (8) to which at least one consumer (9, 

13, 14) is attached, characterized in that in the heat 
exchanger (4) the waste heat of the engine tapped air 

(11) is intended to increase the energy of the cabin 
outgoing air (5) to create cabin outgoing air (5) which 

is enriched in energy and in that after discharge from 
the heat exchanger (4), the energy converter (8) is 

arranged inside the cabin outgoing air line (2), making 
the cabin outgoing air (5) which is enriched in energy 

useful. 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the energy converter (8) is essentially designed as a 

turbine (8a) which is driven by cabin outgoing air (5) 
and provides a mechanical thrust horsepower at the 

output.  
 
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the energy converter (4) and the consumer form a unit and 

consists essentially of at least one propelling nozzle 
(13) or at least one cabin outlet orifice with nozzle 

action in which the pressure difference between cabin 
outgoing air (5) and aircraft environment (7) can be 

converted into propulsion during the flight.
