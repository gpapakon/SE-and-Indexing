<ABSTRACT>
A filtering circuit having the behavior of a low-pass fil­
ter capable of having a long time constant. The filtering 

circuit comprises an input circuit (10) for receiving a volt­
age input signal to be filtered. A comparator circuit (11) is 

provided for monitoring the input signal relative to an ana­
log output signal from an accumulator circuit (13) and pro­

viding an error signal representative of the difference of 
the input and output signals. The error signal is fed to a 

voltage controlled osciilator (17) to generate a frequency 
signal proportional to the error signal. A frequency dividing 

circuit (14) is provided to divide the frequency signal by a 
predetermined division factor to control the low cut-off 

frequency of the filtering circuit whereby to increase the 
response time thereof. An accumulator (13) is provided to 

integrate the frequency signal. An output circuit (33) pro­
vides an output of the stored integrated frequency signal to 

constitute the analog output signal.
