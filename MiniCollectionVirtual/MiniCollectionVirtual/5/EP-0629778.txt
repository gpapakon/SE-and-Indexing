<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a regulating device with starting
and stopping device for screw-type compressors which
contain a compressor element, a minimum pressure valve
which is mounted on the outlet of the compressor element
and a vessel which is mounted between the compressor
element and the minimum pressure valve, which starting and
stopping device contains a non-return valve which is mounted on the
inlet of the compressor element.The oil-injected screw-type compressors have been
equipped until now with a regulating device provided with
a starting and stopping device which contains means to
release the volume, after the compressor has come to a
standstill and thus at zero rotational speed, which is
situated between the outlet of the compressor element and
the minimum pressure valve, in the atmosphere and which
contains a relief valve which makes sure that the
compressor element can further run idly, i.e. at a
minimum pressure of about (0,05 MPa to 0,1 MPa) (0.5 to 1 bar) which is
sufficient to guarantee the oil injection, but whereby a
minimum amount of air is drawn in.With such a starting and stopping device, the succession
of loaded and idle periods of the compressor provides a
possible compressor regulation, and the means to control
the motor are means which make said motor turn at an
almost constant rotational speed, whereas the pressure in
the vessel varies. Every loaded period, with maximum 
vessel pressure, is hereby followed by either an idle
period with minimum pressure in the vessel sufficient to
guarantee the oil injection in the compressor, or by a
stop period with full blasting off of the vessel.The blasting off of the volume between the outlet of the
compressor element and the minimum pressure valve, until
the pressure there becomes equal to the ambient pressure,
is necessary with these known regulating devices to avoid
very high current peaks when restarting. Indeed, given
the output, the motor of the compressor is started with
a starting current restriction, normally a star/D switch,
to avoid current peaks. As a result, however, also the
supplied motor torque drops, which becomes insufficient
to start the compressor without blasting off the pressure
at the outlet.Said blasting off results in a loss of energy, however,
since compressed air is lost without being efficiently
used. The blasting off produces a noise which must be
possibly muffled, whereas the blast-off air must be blown
off. Moreover, the means to blow off said air through
the opening and closing of valves and air valves have
