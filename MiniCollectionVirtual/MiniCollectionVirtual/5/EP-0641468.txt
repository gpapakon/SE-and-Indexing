<ABSTRACT>
An improved method and apparatus for discriminating between currency bills of different denomination uses an optical sensing (18) and correlation technique based on the sensing of bill reflectance characteristic obtained by illuminating and scanning a bill along its narrow dimension. A series of detected reflectance signals are obtained by sampling and digitally processing, under microprocessor control, the reflected light at a plurality of predefined sample points as a currency bill (17) is moved across an illuminated strip (24) with its narrow dimension parallel to the direction of transport of the bill. The sample data is subjected to digital processing, including a normalizing process, whereby the reflectance data represents a characteristic pattern that is unique for a given bill denomination and incorporates sufficient distingishing features between characteristic patterns for discriminating between different currency denominations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of pending United States patent
application Serial No. 07/475,111, filed February 5, 1990, for "Method and
Apparatus for Currency Discrimination and Counting."The present invention relates, in general, to currency identification. The
invention relates more particularly to a method and apparatus for automatic
discrimination and counting of currency bills of different denominations using
light reflectivity characteristics of indicia printed upon the currency bills.A variety of techniques and apparatus have been used to satisfy the
requirements of automated currency handling systems. At the lower end of
sophistication in this area of technology are systems capable of handling only a
specific type of currency, such as a specific dollar denomination, while rejecting
all other currency types. At the upper end are complex systems which are
capable of identifying and discriminating among and automatically counting
multiple currency denominations.Currency discrimination systems typically employ either magnetic sensing
or optical sensing for discriminating between different currency denominations.
Magnetic sensing is based on detecting the presence or absence of magnetic ink
in portions of the printed indicia on the currency by using magnetic sensors,
usually ferrite core-based sensors, and using the detected magnetic signals, after
undergoing analog or digital processing, as the basis for currency discrimination.
The more commonly used optical sensing technique, on the other hand, is based
on detecting and analyzing variations in light reflectance or transmissivity
characteristics occurring when a currency bill is illuminated and scanned by a
strip of focused light. The subsequent currency discrimination is based on the
comparison of sensed optical characteristics with prestored parameters for 
different currency denominations, while accounting for adequate tolerances
reflecting differences among individual bills of a given denomination.A major obstacle in implementing automated currency discrimination
systems is obtaining an optimum compromise between the criteria used to
adequately define the characteristic pattern for a particular currency
denomination, the time required to analyze test data and compare it to
predefined parameters in order to identify the currency bill under scrutiny, and
the rate at which successive currency bills may be mechanically fed through and
scanned. Even with the use of microprocessors for processing the test data
resulting from the

A currency evaluation device for receiving a stack of currency bills (228), rapidly
evaluating all the bills (228) in the stack, and then re-stacking the bills (228), said

device comprising:

a feed mechanism (227, 246, 248) for receiving a stack of currency bills (228) and
feeding said bills (228) in the direction of a predetermined dimension of the bills (228),

one at a time, to a feed station (274, 296);
a bill transport mechanism (301 to 304) for transporting bills (228) in the direction
of the predetermined dimension of bills (228), from said feed station (274, 296) to a

stacking station output receptacle (242), said output receptacle (242) comprising a
stacking mechanism (238, 240);
a stationary optical scanning head (296) located between said feed and stacking
mechanisms (227, 246, 238, 240) for scanning at least a preselected segment of each

bill (228) transported between said feed and stacking mechanisms (227, 246, 248,
238, 240) by said transport mechanism (301 to 304), and producing an output signal

characteristic of the denomination of the bill;
signal processing means (30) for receiving said output signal and processing
same; and
overlap detector means (S1, S2) for directing a light beam through each bill (228)
transported to the scanning head (296) and for detecting the intensity of the light

beam after it has passed through the bill (228);
characterised in that
said bill transport mechanism (301 to 304) transports said bills (228) at a fate in
excess of about 800 bills (228) per minute;
said signal processing means (30) determines the denomination of each scanned
bill (228); and that the device comprises:
means for comparing the detected light intensity with a predetermined intensity
value corresponding to the bill denomination determined by said signal processing

means, and determining from said comparison whether said light beam passed
through more than one bill (228).

selecting one of said multiple values for use in said comparison.

directing a light beam through each bill (228);
detecting the intensity of the light beam after it has passed through the bill (228);
characterised by

determining the denomination of each bill (401);
comparing the detected light intensity with a predetermined intensity value
corresponding to the determined bill denomination (402-408); and

obtaining a series of analog reflectance signals corresponding to light reflected
from each of said successive bill sections;
digitising and processing said series of analog reflectance signals to yield a set of
digital data samples which, in combination, represent a data pattern characteristic of

the currency denomination of said bill (17; 228);
generating and storing a set of master characteristic patterns corresponding to
the optical scanning of original bills of each of the different currency denominations to

228) as having the denomination corresponding to the stored master pattern with the
highest degree of correlation with said characteristic pattern if said highest degree of

correlation is greater than a first predetermined threshold, otherwise (2) determining
the difference between said two highest degrees of correlation, and positively

identifying said scanned bill (17, 228) as having the denomination corresponding to
the stored master pattern with the highest degree of correlation with said characteristic

pattern only if (a) said difference is greater than a second predetermined threshold
and (b) said highest degree of correlation is greater than a third minimum

predetermined threshold.
