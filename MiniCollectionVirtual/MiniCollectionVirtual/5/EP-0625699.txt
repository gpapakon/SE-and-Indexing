<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for real-time mapping the 
temperature of a flame, comprising a pair of 

analog-to-digital converters for converting two 
luminance signals in discrete spectral bands emitted 

from a TV camera aimed at the flame to a pair of binary 
codes applied as address to a memory which outputs a 

temperature code associated with the address code pair 
according to a known relation defined by physical laws, 

the analog-to-digital conversion and memory reading 
taking place each within a shorter time interval than 

the flame image spot scanning period.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus 
for real time mapping the temperature of a flame, in 
particular for mapping, even on a three-dimensional 
basis, one or more flames of boiler burners. Industrial processes are controlled by 
parameters of an inclusive type (power output, 
pressure, etc.). There may be several plant conditions capable 
of giving the same values for the quantities of 
interest which simultaneously optimize the plant 
stresses or other possible ancillary parameters such 
as, in the instance of incinerator boilers, the release 
of pollutants. The studies on three-dimensional (3D) mapping 
systems for flame temperature partake in this line of 
technological development aimed at a more exhaustive 
knowledge and/or control of parameters of interest in 
the operation of a boiler. The applications of these flame 
characterization studies follow two major courses, a 
first one directed to the study, development, design 
assistance, and installation of burners, and the second 
concerned primarily with the plant operation and the 
ability to also keep track of its evolution and provide  
 
appropriate corrective actions. Known are, for example from European Patent 
Application EP-A-469258 published on 5-2-1992, 
three-dimensional mapping arrangements for the 
temperature of a flame which generate, from a picture 
picked up by a TV camera, a vector or processed image 
indicating the temperatures at various spots on the 
flame. The temperature picture is obtained by an 
essentially software-based process using appropriate 
algorithms. The processing method, which is particularly 
cumbersome and applied repetitively to each spot of the 
picture imaged by the TV camera, results in the 
generation of a thermal map which is effected off-line, 
and hence available at a retarded time with respect to 
the imaging event which is much longer than the 
generation period of the next pictures picked up by the 
TV camera. These mapping arrangements, while being at 
least in part effective to meet study and designing 
requirements that require no immediate response to the 
evolution of the combustion and flame generation 
process, are in no way appropriate to track and 
describe dynamically the flame generation process in  
 
order to allow its control or even the mere observation 
and monitoring of the outcome of actions taken, such as 
changes in the burner orientations. Thus, the need for a picture processing 
system which can operate in real time is felt 
particularly. Even where modern data
