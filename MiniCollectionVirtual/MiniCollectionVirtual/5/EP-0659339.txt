<ABSTRACT>
A trap housing (10) for trapping insects, which particularly 
allows an insect trapping adhesive sheet (20) to be replaced with 

ease and which can trap a great number of insects efficiently, 
is provided. The adhesive trap housing is constructed so that 

a tray (11) and a cover body (12) having rectangular openings are 
pivotably joined with each other via hinge pieces and 

engagement members so as to allow the housing (10) to be freely 
opened and closed. Retaining pieces are arranged on the 

corners of the tray (11) so that an insect trapping adhesive sheet (20) 
can be removably fixed thereto. In addition, a window is 

provided in the tray (11), and a curved portion projecting inward 
towards the tray (11) is formed in a substantially middle portion of 

the cover body (12). Bird protecting barriers are attached to the 
openings of the cover body (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to housings capable of trapping flying insects such as moths.
Such a housing with the features of the precharacterizing part of claim 1 is known
from US-A-42 44 134. This pre-known housing uses an adhesive sheet disposed
within said housing for trapping flying insects. The housing comprises a hollow
cover body having at least three sides, including a top side, a left side, and a right
side. Within the housing, a tray is disposed, facing the top side of the cover body.
Further, an odorant member for attracting insects may be arranged within the
housing. First and second ends of the housing are open to air and have
substantially rectangular openings.A generally commercially available conventional adhesive tray housing is shown in
figure 9. The adhesive trap housing 1 shown in figure 9 has the following structure.
A triangular housing 2 is formed by folding a flat piece of cardboard into a triangular
prism, the flat piece of cardboard being prepared by laminating a plastic film on the
surfaces of raw corrugated cardboard. Hanging strings 3 are attached to two points
on the apex of the triangular housing 2. An odorant member (not shown) that
gradually emits the odor of an attractant, such as a sex pheromone, is fixed to the
inner ceiling. In addition, an insect trapping adhesive sheet 4 is put on the inner
bottom surface and fixed on the bottom plate with a clip 5. Adhesive trap housing 1 formed of triangular housing 2 has small triangular
openings which make the open area on both sides narrower. As a result, the
number of insects entering the housing is decreased, and the number of insects
trapped therein is small. In addition, since the housing is a triangular prism simply
made of three flat panels, an insect that has entered the housing from the opening
on one side can exit the opening on the other side, further reducing the number of
trapped insects.Moreover, once assembled, the triangular housing 2 is hard to open. Therefore, to
replace the insect trapping adhesive sheet 4, the insect trapping adhesive sheet 4
has to be removed and new one has to be inserted and fixed through the narrow
side openings. Since the sheet 4 has an adhesive agent applied thereto, the
handling of it is cumbersome and, thus, the operation becomes extremely
complicated. Particularly, since the trap is used while hung on a tree, replacement
of the insect trapping adhesive sheet 4 is accomplished either by taking the
adhesive trap housing 1 down from the tree, or by using a ladder every time such
replacement

characterized in that

at least one window (13) for removing the insect trapping adhesive sheet (20) is
provided in said tray (11).
The adhesive trap housing according to one of the previous claims,
characterized in that

retaining pieces (14) for allowing the insect trapping adhesive sheet (20) to be
releasably fixed to said tray (11) are provided on an inner face of said tray that faces

said top side of said cover body (12). 
The adhesive trap housing according to one of the previous claims,
characterized in that

said cover body (12) is comprised of a front cover half (12a) and a rear cover half
(12b), said cover house being provided with projections (17) and corresponding

insertion holes (18), said cover halves (12a,b) fitting together by inserting said
