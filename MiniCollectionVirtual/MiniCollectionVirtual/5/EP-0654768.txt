<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an alarm system and method by analysis of a received signal originating from a sensor detecting a standing wave ratio set up in a vehicle passenger compartment, especially by ultrasonic waves, so as to detect intrusion into the passenger compartment, by the alterations in the said standing wave ratio. According to the invention, the alarm system includes a microcontroller (M) which produces signals for matching a receiver (2) during learning periods in order to match the sensitivity of the system by anticipation. Vehicle alarms.
