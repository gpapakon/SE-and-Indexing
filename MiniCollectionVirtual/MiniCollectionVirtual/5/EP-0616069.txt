<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a machine for the washing and/or 
drying of laundry comprising: 
a front loading door (10) that, in particular, in the closed position 
results in being significantly flush with the frontal wall of the cabinet of 
the machine, a hinge, for the hinging of said door (10) to said cabinet of the 
machine. As is known, front loading washing machines are supplied with a door, 
generally of a circular shape, through which the user can have access to 
the inside of the basket of the machine, for the normal laundry loading 
and unloading operations. Such door, or port, is generally hinged to the 
cabinet of the machine by means of a hinge comprising a fixed part, 
internally secured to the body of the machine, and a mobile part, 
integral to the door; the fixed and mobile parts have mutual hinging 
means according to a substantially vertical axis. The mobile part of the hinge has an arched portion, having a curvature 
axis substantially coinciding with the vertical axis mentioned above: 
such arched portion extends, and is mobile, through a substantially 
vertical slot, being part of the fixed part of the hinge, and through a 
corresponding slot obtained on the cabinet of the machine.  As an example of the cited known art the Italian Patent for a Utility 
Model Nr. 175.254 is noted. Such cited solution presents several problems, above all in laundry 
washing machines with flush doors, or in front loading machines in 
which the greater part of the door results in being embedded and is 
thus substantially aligned with the frontal wall of the cabinet of the 
machine. A first problem is due to the fact that, according to the cited known art, 
the hinge is internally fixed to the cabinet, which is not simple or fast, 
and determines a certain bulk within the cabinet itself. Another problem is that the cabinet itself has to have a slot within 
which the mobile part of the hinge moves: such slot, apart from having a 
terrible aesthetic appearance with the door open, permits the passage of 
humidity or of eventual foreign bodies to the interior of the cabinet. Furthermore, as is known, laundry washing machine doors have a 
shaped glass front, that extends in a manner being considerably 
pronounced towards the interior of the cabinet: another problem is that 
the hinges of the described type do not allow for obtaining in machines 
with flush doors a level of opening that consents the complete release of 
the loading door: in such machines the bulk determined by the glass of 
the door can

<CLAIMS>
Laundry washing and/or drying machine comprising: 

a front loading door (10) that, in particular, in the closed position 
results in being significantly flush with the frontal wall (20) of the 

cabinet of the machine, 
a hinge, for the hinging of said door (10) to said cabinet (20) of the 
machine, 

characterised in that said hinge is an articulated hinge (1-7, 11-16) 
having a rotary and translational movement. 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that said hinge (1-7, 11-16) comprises at least a pair of 

first pins (4,5), integral to a fixed hinge element (1), at least a pair of 
second pins (13,16), integral to a mobile hinge element (11), and two or 

more arms (6,7) connecting in an articulated quadrilateral manner the 
two pairs of first (4,5) and second (13,16) pins. 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to the previous 
claim, characterised in that said fixed hinge element (1) has a pair of 

supports (3) within which the pins (4,5) are inserted for the hinging of 
the non oscillating extremities of said arms (6,7). 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to the previous 
claim, characterised in that said arms are three and in particular 

comprise: 

a pair of external identical arms (6), each of which hinged at its non 
oscillating extremity in said supports (3), and 
an internal arm (7), hinged at its non oscillating extremity between 
said supports (3), and therefore between said external arms (6). 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to claim 2, 
characterised in that said fixed hinge element (1) is fixed to the exterior 

of the cabinet of the machine, in particular in a recess (21) present in 
the frontal part of the cabinet (20). 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to claim 2, 
 

characterised in that said mobile hinge element makes up part of the 
door and that, in particular, the oscillating extremity of said arms (6,7) 

are hinged to the door by way of a seat (11) obtained within. 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to the previous 
claim, characterised in that said seat (11) has lateral holes (12), apt at 

housing the extremities of the first pins (13) protruding from the 
oscillating extremities of said external arms (6). 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to the previous 
claim, characterised in that said seat (11) has a central hooking portion 

(14), equipped with a through hole (15), that, in particular, is apt at 
being linked with a fork (7A) constituting the oscillating extremity of 

said internal arm (7), said hooking portion (14) being pivoted at the 
oscillating extremity of said internal arm (7) by way of a second pin 

(16). 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to at least one of 
the previous claims, characterised in that the external arms (6) are of a 

different length compared to the internal arm (7) and that, in particular, 
the distance between the hinging point (13) of the oscillating extremity 

and the hinging point (4) of the non oscillating point of said external 
arms (6) is less than the distance between the hinging point (16) of the 

oscillating extremity and the hinging point of the non oscillating (5) of 
said internal hinge (7), said quadrilateral articulation as a consequence 

being irregular. 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to at least one 
of the previous claims, characterised in that, with the door being 

completely open, the glass (22) of said door is of no encumbrance for 
the loading aperture (A, fig. 7) of the washing 
machine. 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to at least one 
of the previous claims, characterised in that said hinge has stop means 

(24;30,31) apt at avoiding that, upon the termination of the door 
opening, said door comes into contact with the frontal part (20;20') of 

 
said cabinet, said stop means being in particular realised through said 

arms (30,31) 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to at least one 
of the previous claims, characterised in that said hinge (1-7,11-16) is 

indifferently used be it with machines having a door opening from right 
to left or with machines having a door opening from left to right. 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to at least one 
of the previous claims, characterised in that said seat (11) is obtained 

within the frame (10) of said door, that is particularly of a circular form, 
and that its form is apt at receiving, with the door closed, said fixed 

hinge element (1) and said arms (6,7), in such a way that the 
encumbrance of said hinge (1-7, 11-16) is reduced to a minimum. 
Laundry washing and/or drying machine, according to claim 12, 
characterised in that said hinge (1-7, 11-16) and/or its fixing means 

(1,2) to said cabinet are arranged in such a way so as not to require slots 
on the frontal part (20) of the cabinet.
