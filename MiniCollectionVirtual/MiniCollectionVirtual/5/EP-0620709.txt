<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for isolating bioactive proteins such as lactoperoxidase and lactoferrin from milk and/or milk derivatives, characterized by the steps of: a) adsorbing said proteins to a cation exchanger by passing the milk or the milk derivative over the cation exchanger at a high superficial velocity (more than 500 cm per hour) and a high liquid load (100-600 bed volumes per hour); b) eluting these proteins, separately or simultaneously, by elution with one or more salt solutions, so as to form one or more eluates, optionally followed by c) drying of the said eluates. The invention further relates to products obtained by this process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for isolating 
the metalloprotein lactoferrin and the enzyme lactoperoxidase 
from milk and milk products on an industrial scale. Lactoferrin (LF), a metalloprotein, occurs in minor 
amounts inter alia in milk from mammals. It is capable of 
binding 2 mol of iron per mol of protein. It thus provides the 
young mammal with iron in assimilable form. It moreover 
functions as a bacteria inhibiting agent for pathogenic 
microorganisms that are iron-dependent. The enzyme lactoperoxidase (LP) catalyzes the breakdown of 
hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a hydrogen donor or an 
oxidizable substance. In milk, it functions as a bacteria 
inhibitor, inter alia of pathogenic Streptococci and 
Salmonella in the presence of thiocyanate and peroxide, both 
present in milk. In raw cow's milk, concentrations of about 
200 mg/l have been reported for lactoferrin and concentrations 
of about 30 mg/l for lactoperoxidase, depending inter alia on 
the stage of lactation and breed. Lactoperoxidase in particular is thermolabile. Upon 
pasteurization, this enzyme will be inactivated in part or in 
whole, depending on the intensity of the heat treatment. It is 
therefore obvious to start from raw milk for the isolation of 
these two components. However, this is technologically less 
interesting, because small amounts of LP and LF must be 
separated from large amounts of other substances (proteins, 
sugars, fats). Moreover, it is uncertain whether the milk from 
which LP or LF has been withdrawn can still be used as "milk" 
in terms of the official food regulations, for human  
 
consumption and/or as raw material for making cheese and 
butter. It is therefore obvious not to start from raw milk, but, 
instead, to start from a by-product such as formed in cheese 
or butter making, namely, whey or skim milk. In cheese making, 
the milk is subjected only to a minor heat treatment. As a 
consequence, substantially all of the lactoperoxidase is still 
present in cheese whey. However, only a part of the 
lactoferrin remains present, namely, about 25%. Nevertheless, 
whey is an attractive starting material. It is available in 
large amounts, cheap, and, in a manner of speaking, pre-purified. NL-A 8201947 discloses a process for isolating LP and LF 
from cheese whey. Whey having a pH between 7.5 and 8.2 is 
applied to a column filled with buffered silica gel. The 
proteins adsorbed to the column can be eluted, whereby a 
lactoferrin preparation and a lactoperoxidase preparation are 
obtained.

<CLAIMS>
A process for isolating bio-active proteins such as 
lactoperoxidase and lactoferrin from milk and/or milk 

derivatives, comprising the steps of: 

a) adsorbing said proteins to a cation exchanger by 
passing the milk or the milk derivative over the cation 

exchanger at a high superficial velocity (more than 500 
cm per hour) and a high liquid load (100-600 bed 

volumes per hour); 
b) eluting said proteins, separately or simultaneously, 
using one or more salt solutions, so as to form one or 

more eluates, optionally followed by 
c) drying of said eluates. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cation exchanger is present as an adsorption bed in a 

column, the superficial velocity of the milk and/or milk 
derivatives being 2,000-3,000 cm per hour and a liquid 

load of 100 to 300 bed volumes per hour. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the binding capacity of the ion 

exchanger is more than 10 g lactoperoxidase and more than 
10 g lactoferrin per liter bed volume and more than 80% of 

the said proteins is extracted. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the milk derivative is chosen from 

the group consisting of skim milk, evaporated skim milk, 
buttermilk, milk protein concentrate, cheese whey, casein 

whey, whey concentrate, desalted whey, desalted whey 
concentrate and whey-protein concentrates.  

 
A process according to claims 1-4, characterized in that 
milk derivatives are first clarified by removing coarser 

contaminants. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said proteins are eluted from the 

column, separately or simultaneously, with salt solutions 
having a concentration of 2.5 mol at most, more 

particularly 2 mol. 
A process according to claim 6, characterized in that said 
eluates are dried through vacuum-drying, freeze-drying, 

spray-drying or roller-drying, which drying step may or may 
not be preceded by a desalting and/or concentrating step.
