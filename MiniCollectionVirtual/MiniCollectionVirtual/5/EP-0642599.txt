<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an improved method and apparatus for pre-treating a substrate surface (19) to prepare it for subsequent deposition upon it of a film of diamond. The method of pre-treating a surface according to the invention comprises the steps of positioning a quantity of diamond dust (16) in relation to the surface, producing a shock wave in gas adjacent the dust, subjecting the dust to the shock wave, and thereby causing the diamond dust to impinge at high velocity on to the surface. The apparatus according to the invention comprises means for holding a charge of diamond dust (15), means for generating a shock wave in gas adjacent the charge of diamond dust (17), and means for directing the shock wave at the diamond dust (12) and causing the diamond dust to be expelled at high velocity for impingement on the substrate surface. The invention also provides a method depositing a diamond film on a substrate, including pre-treatment by the aforesaid method or apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DIAMOND FILM DEPOSITIONThis Invention relates to the deposition of diamond films on surfaces of substrates of suitable materials and, in particular, to the pre-treat ent of such surfaces to prepare them for subsequent diamond film deposition by any of a number of available chemical vapour techniques such as described, for example, in a review article entitled "Diamonds from the vapour phase", by P. Bachmann, published in "Physics World", April 1991, pages 32-36. Suitable pre-treatment of a substrate surface, to enhance the nucleation density and the rate of growth during film deposition, is of paramount importance for the success of all these vapour deposition techniques. Conventionally it has been accomplished by abrading the surface using, as the abrasive, dust of diamond or other hard materials, either dry or as a paste or suspended in a liquid, such as water in an ultrasonic bath. If selective film deposition is required, on only parts of the abraded surface, various techniques may be employed. For instance, it 1s known to provide those parts with a temporary resist coating and then expose the remainder of the abraded surface to etching by means of an Ar-ion beam. Such etching or sputtering of unmasked areas of the surface reduces the nucleation density there due to the abrasion, and it 1s found that after subsequent removal of the temporary masking it is only on those parts which have been masked, so that the abrasions have remained unaffected by the 1on-beam etching step, that diamond film deposition occurs when the whole surface is submitted to the diamond deposition step.It 1s an object of the present invention to provide an improved method and means of pre-treating a substrate surface to prepare it for subsequent deposition upon it of a film of diamond.According to one aspect of the invention, the method of pre-treating a surface comprises the steps of positioning a quantity of diamond dust in relation to the surface, producing a shock wave in gas adjacent the dust, subjecting the dust to the 

 shock wave, and thereby causing the diamond dust to impinge at high velocity on to the surface.The shock wave may be produced by causing a build-up of gas under pressure contained in part by a rupturable membrane or diaphragm, and then causing the membrane or diaphragm to rupture. The rupture of the membrane or diaphragm may be caused either by progressively increasing the pressure of the gas or may be initiated by piercing it with a sharp point. Alternatively the shock wave may be produced in the gas
