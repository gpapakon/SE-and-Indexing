<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a unique force generating mechanism which is 
easily adapted for use in a compact lightweight tool (10) requiring 

high work forces. The mechanism includes a force generating 
member disposed within an actuation chamber (26) where either 

pneumatic or hydraulic fluid pressure is allowed to bear against 
a relatively large ram surface (52) causing a deflection of the ram 

in a first direction and translation of the ends of the ram in 
a second direction substantially perpendicular to the first 

direction. A working force, larger than the force of the fluid 
bearing on the ram surface, is thereby generated along this 

direction of translation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sheet material 
forming devices and more specifically to a portable sheet 
material forming tool incorporating a unique force generating 
mechanism. In the manufacture of products there is often the need 
to join several pieces of sheet material to build various 
assemblies and subassemblies. In this regard, there are many 
different means for accomplishing this joining task. For 
example, there is adhesive bonding, welding or cold deformation. 
In cold deformation, several pieces of sheet material are 
plastically deformed in such a manner that they are locked 
together. Depending on the thickness, strength, and/or the 
number of pieces of material to be joined, a great amount of 
force is required to accomplish this plastic deformation. An apparatus and method for accomplishing cold forming 
joining of sheet material is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. 
Patents Nos. 5,027,503, 4,910,853, 4,757,609, the disclosures of 
which are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference. As 
is disclosed in these patents, the sheets of material to be 
joined are placed between complementary die members. A suitable 
press is then activated to provide the force and displacement 
necessary to deform the material between the die members thereby 
joining the sheets of material together. This process has a 
number of advantages over such joining processes as 
resistance/spot welding and bonding which are more fully 
discussed in the above referenced patents.  In the embodiments disclosed in the above U.S. patents, 
the dies are generally attached to relatively large presses thus 
requiring the sheets to be joined to be manipulated with respect 
to the press. In contrast, portable spot welding devices have 
been in existence for many years. These smaller devices allow 
for the joining tool to be manipulated with respect to the 
workpiece thereby making it easier to work with large workpieces. 
Smaller portable tools are available which can provide the 
necessary clamping force to join the sheets and which allow for 
manipulation of the joining tool with respect to the workpiece 
and thus allow for easier operations with larger workpieces. One 
such tool is disclosed in commonly assigned U. S. Patent No. 
4,878,284, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly 
incorporated by reference herein. These tools generally 
incorporate a pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder to provide the 
force and displacement necessary for sheet material joining and 
clamping. Unfortunately, the levels of

A force generating mechanism comprising: 
   a body having a cavity formed therein; 

   a cover secured to the body adjacent the cavity thereby defining a chamber; 
   a resilient ram having first and second ends and being disposed within the 

chamber thereby dividing the chamber into first and second working chambers; 
   seal means for sealing the ram against the walls of the chamber thereby sealing 

the first working chamber from the second working chamber; 
   means for pressurizing one of the working chambers whereby the resilient ram 

is caused to deflect in a first direction and said first and second ends are caused to translate 
relative to one another in a direction substantially perpendicular to said first direction such 

that a force is generated along the direction of translation at one of said ends; and 
   means for connecting tooling to said one of said ends of said ram whereby said 

tooling is caused to translate with said one of said ends. 
A force generating mechanism as claimed in claim 1 wherein said ram is normally 

arcuate in shape. 
The force generating mechanism of claim 2 further comprising means for 
depressurizing said chamber so that said ram can return to its normal arcuate state.

comprising stop means for limiting translation of the other end of the ram such that a 

working force is generated at said one end. 
The force generating mechanism of any one of the preceding claims wherein said 
means for connecting tooling to said one end of said ram comprises a tang portion formed 

 
integral to said ram, said tang portion being adapted for engaging a slot formed in said 

tooling to be connected. 
The force generating mechanism of any one of the preceding claims further 
comprising means for evacuating the non-pressurized working chamber as the first working 

chamber is pressurized. 
The force generating mechanism of any one of the preceding claims further 
comprising means for depressurizing the pressurized working chamber whereby the resilient 

ram returns to its non-deflected state. 
The force generating mechanism of any one of the preceding claims wherein said 
chamber has a width, and the resilient ram has a width which is slightly smaller in width that 

that of the chamber.

first and second ends are caused to translate in a direction substantially perpendicular to said 
first direction such that a force is generated along the direction of translation; 

   an anvil secured to the body; and
 

   work producing tooling operatively connected to an end of the ram whereby 
the translational movement of the end causes the tooling to move relatively toward the anvil 

whereby work is performed on workpieces disposed between the tooling and anvil.
