<ABSTRACT>
A system is provided for inserting selected 
commercials from a remote source via satellite into pre-cued 

cable network commercial breaks at targeted regional 
groupings of local cable headend operators without storage 

of the commercials at each headend. By sequencing the 
avails used for insertion among the groupings of headends, 

by creating plural levels of simultaneity, and by using 
compression/decompression techniques, a highly efficient 

use of the satellite per each transponder channel is 
achieved despite overlap in breaks as between networks; 

while, at the same time, allowing sufficient time during 
each break for the local headend operator to insert his own 

local ads if desired, and to use as well, if desired, the 
decompression capabilities of the system without the need 

for the headend to invest in its own.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods 
for automatically inserting a television signal from a 
remote source into a plurality of local cable television 
broadcasts. In particular, but not exclusively, the 
invention is direction to a method and apparatus for 
inserting pre-recorded television commercials from a remote 
central site into local cable television broadcasts in 
several designated geographic areas. At present, cable television networks are 
broadcast over satellite communications. A cable network, 
such as Cable News Network (CNN), will provide programming, 
cable network commercials and air time cued by a preceding 
signal during which the local cable service providers are 
allowed to insert their own commercial spots. The cable 
network signal, including the cue tone, is transmitted to 
the local cable service providers via satellite by 
transmitting the cable network signal up to a satellite 
transponder that then transmits the signal back down to the 
earth's surface over a downlink. The downlink covers a 
large geographic area. There are usually many local cable 
service providers in the geographic area of the downlink. The local cable television service providers 
receive the signal from the satellite transponder over the 
downlink. Each of these cable service providers is usually 
referred to as a cable "headend". In the usual situation 
a plurality of cable headends are grouped geographically  
 
for advertising purposes, and such groupings have become 
known as Designated Market Areas or DMA's. Each of these cable headends receives a number of 
cable network signals such as CNN, the Music Television 
Channel (MTV), the Sports Network (ESPN) and many others, 
usually through the use of multiple dedicated satellite 
dishes. The time made available for insertion of messages 
may be referred to as "breaks". These breaks need not be 
used in their entirety. The time used may be referred to 
as an "avail", and this terminology is adopted for use 
herein. These "avails" may occur during the networks' 
commercial "breaks", at a time when a particular network 
may be running its own commercials capable of being 
electronically preempted by the insertions, or the network 
may leave blank air time for the insertions. Typical 
"avails" are for 30 seconds and there may be two or more 
"avails" within a "break" which may be of 1 or 2 minutes in 
duration. In order to insert advertising into a network 
cued "break", cable headend operators have employed 
automation equipment that
