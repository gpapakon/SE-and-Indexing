<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for the unpacking and packing of containers from and into corresponding receptacles, such as cardboard boxes, bottle cases or the like which are used in a continuous work process, mainly in a sector of the drinks industry. The containers (6.9) located in the receptacles (7.1; 7.2) are picked up according to colour, shape or height and abnormal containers (6 or 9) are removed from the receptacles by means of gripper elements of a container-packing machine and the empty places are filled by identical containers (6 or 9).

Method for unpacking and packing of containers out of and in corresponding 
receptacles, and these receptacles (7.1, 7.2) with containers (6, 9) in a predetermined 

formation (12) inside will run along an unpacking device (13) with 
gripper elements (4) via a transport way, characterized by 


registration of containers (6 or 9) inside the receptacles (7.1, 7.2) according to 
colour, form or hight, 
removing of abnormal containers (6 or 9) from the receptacles (7.1, 7.2) by 
means of gripper elements (4), which are activated by a control device in 

dependence on registered colour, form or hight, 
registration of empty spaces in receptacles (7.1, 7,2) by an empty-space 
detector (11) and completing with containers (6 or 9) of the same kind in the 

pre-determined formation (12) by gripper elements (4) of a packing device (14) 
controlled by the empty-space detector. 
Method according to claim 1 characterized by that before respectively after the 
containers (6 or 9) have been selected, a colour detection (10) of the receptacles 

(7.1, 7.2) has been made, and these have been guided onto corresponding 
transport devices. 
Instruction for realization of the method acc. to claim 1 with a transport device for 
receptacles (7.1, 7.2) and a container unpacking device (13) with gripper 

elements (4) for removing the containers (6 or 9) characterized by that in front of 
container packing device (13) is placed a detector for colour, form or hight (5); 

that the gripper elements (4) can be activated for removing of abnormal containers 
in dependence on the registered colour, form or hight, and that after the container 

unpacking device (13) a container packing device (14) is arranged with 
controllable, by means of a pre-switched empty-space detector, grippers (4) for 

completing of empty spaces with containers of the same kind.
