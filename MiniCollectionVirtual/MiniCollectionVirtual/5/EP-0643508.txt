<ABSTRACT>
The method consists in calculating (8) the Chernoff factor, by time-based integration of the Chernoff bounds successively over the Gaussian probability law associated with thermal noise, and by time-based integration of the result of the preceding integration. Applications: ionospheric transmision on a HF channel.
