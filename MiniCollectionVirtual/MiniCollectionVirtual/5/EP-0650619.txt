<ABSTRACT>
A portable bar code scanner apparatus (2) having a keyboard and a display (6) mounted on the front face of the housing. The housing is configured to be held in the palm of one hand with the keys (8, 10) on the keyboard engageable by the thumb or fingers of the hand holding the housing. Only one hand is required for scan actuation and key entry and to maintain a comfortable precision grip. The portable bar code scanner apparatus (2) may also include a radio transmitting data to or receiving data from a host computer, and may be mounted on the back of the operator's hand for hands-free operation while in an object-sense mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bar code
scanners and, in particular, to a portable, wireless,
optical scanner configured to be held in the palm of one
hand with the thumb or fingers of that hand operating
the keys of a keyboard on the front face of the scanner
housing.Bar codes today are widely used for a
multitude of applications, such as sales order entry,
inventory control, marketing data collection, asset
management, and the like. In particular, the use of bar
codes has become so common they are now typically found
on store shelves and on packages, containers, cans, and
the like in which merchandise is packaged and sold. As
a consequence, a variety of devices for reading and
decoding bar codes are known.Bar code scanners generally fall within one of
two types, laser scanners and contact scanners. A laser
scanner resembles a "gun" in that it generally has a
barrel, a pistol grip which is sometimes also referred
to as a "power grip," and a trigger. This design is
preferred because it aids in aiming the laser scanner
properly and in controlling and balancing the laser
scanner which, due to its weight, tends to cause the
hand and wrist holding it to tire over time. A laser 
scanner scans or "reads" a bar code by pointing the
barrel in the direction of the bar code while holding it
by its pistol grip, and pulling the trigger. This
causes the laser to emit a light beam which exits the
barrel of the laser scanner and strikes the bar code. A
portion of the light beam is then reflected back through
the barrel in such a manner as to strike a detector
which transmits the information electronically for
further processing, e.g., to a microprocessor.Contact scanners are sometimes also referred
to as "pencil wands" due to their narrow, pencil-like
shape. Contact scanners scan or "read" a bar code by
emitting visible red or infrared light such as, for
example, from an LED which strikes the bar code while
the scanner is moved across the bar code in a linear
direction with the tip of the scanner touching the bar
code label. As with a laser scanner, a portion of the
light is reflected back into the wand in such a manner
as to strike a detector which then transmits the
information electronically for further processing.Traditionally, laser scanners and contact
scanners were comparatively simple devices that included
only the requisite optics. Such scanners did not
include a keyboard, a display, or a memory, and they
needed to be connected via a cable to a computer device.
This enabled the operator to view data on a

<CLAIMS>
A portable bar code scanner apparatus (2)
comprising:


a housing configured to be held in the
palm of one hand with a front face (4) of the housing facing

upwardly from the palm and with an upper end (18) of the
housing facing outwardly and comprising a transparent window (20);
a keyboard and a display (6) mounted on the
front face of the housing, the keyboard being oriented

with its upper end nearest the upper end (18) of the housing
having a full numeric set of keys (8) that are individually

engageable by the thumb or fingers of the hand holding
the housing; and
means (30-40) disposed within the housing for
scanning a bar code positioned adjacent to the upper end (18)

of the housing, said means emitting light which passes through
said transparent window (20),

wherein the portable bar code scanner apparatus is 
characterized
in that
 the keyboard includes a scan key (10)
for initiating operation of the means (30-40) for scanning, the

scan key (10) being located at the end of the keyboard
nearest the upper end (18) of the housing.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of claim 1, wherein the means for scanning a bar code

includes a laser (30).
The portable bar code scanner.apparatus
of claim 1 or 2, and further comprising a radio transceiver

disposed within the housing for transmitting and
receiving data to and from a host computer.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of any of claims 1-3, wherein:


the apparatus further comprises a printed
circuit board (40) disposed within the housing; and
the radio transceiver includes a lead
deposited on the printed circuit board.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of any of claims 1-4, wherein the means for scanning a bar code is

manually activated by engaging a predetermined scan key (10) 
located at an end of the keyboard nearest the upper end (18)

of the housing, using the thumb or a finger of the hand
holding the housing.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of any of claims 1-5, wherein the means (30-40) for scanning a bar code is

adapted to operate in an object-sense mode, to
intermittiently scan for the presence of an adjacent bar

code, whereupon the means for scanning automatically
scans the bar code.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of claim 6, and further comprising means (22) for mounting

the housing on the back of the hand so that the scanner
apparatus (2) can be operated hands free in the object-sense

mode.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of claim 7, wherein the means for mounting comprises a

strap (22) sized and adapted to secure the housing to the
back of the hand.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of any of claims 1-8, wherein the display (6) can display a plurality

of characters in a multi-line format.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of any of claims 1-9, wherein the portion of the display (6) located

furthest from the keyboard is angled upwardly towards
the keyboard, to improve readability.
The portable bar code scanner apparatus
of any of claims 1-10, wherein the keyboard includes a plurality of

separate keys (8, 10) arranged in a plurality of curved rows.
