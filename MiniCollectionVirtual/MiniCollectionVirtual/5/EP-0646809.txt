<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement on the terrain of a seismic transmission/reception system changes as it advances along the explored profile, which changes the respective distances between the shock source (T) and each of the seismic receivers (Bi). In order to take this into account, each of the acquisition units (Ri) used on the terrain to amplify, digitise and store the seismic signals received during each transmission/reception cycle (or optionally a central station), is provided with processing means suited for automatic determination of the gain to be assigned to the various amplifiers according to the set of signals acquired and selection rules taking into account the level of the signals and their observed change over a plurality of successive transmission/reception cycles. Application to automatic decentralised monitoring of acquisition apparatus.

A method of acquiring signals picked up by
seismic receivers with automatic cyclic matching

performed at regular intervals, depending on the
duration of successive seismic transmission-reception

cycles, of the gain to be applied thereto, these
signals being collected by an acquisition system

consisting of at least one acquisition device (Ai)
positioned in an exploration zone in order to collect

the signals received by at least one seismic receiver
(Ri1-Rik) coupled with the formations in response to

vibrations applied by a source (T), this device having
at least one amplifier (PA1-PAk) linked to gain

switching circuits and likely to apply a certain number
p of different amplification gains, g1, g2, ..., gp, to

the seismic signals, digitising means (AD1-ADk) of the
over-sampling type producing successive digital words,

storage means (M) for the digital words produced and a
control unit including a processing unit (2, 7),

characterised in that it consists in:

selecting from the digital words produced by each
acquisition device, at least during one cycle, a

digital word representative of the maximum energy
of at least one seismic signal received,
comparing the digital word selected with several
digital words representing threshold values

delimiting several ranges on the scale of
variation permitted by the digitising means,
as a function of the range, choosing the optimum
gain value to be applied to the amplifier for at

least one subsequent cycle, and
controlling gain switching circuits to apply this
optimum gain value.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that it consists in choosing a gain value on the

basis of several digital words selected after several
successive cycles.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterised
in that it consists in choosing an optimum gain value

on the basis of variations in the value of the digital
words selected within ranges delimited by threshold

values and during successive cycles.
A method as claimed in claim 3, characterised
in that the optimum gain is chosen by taking account of

the direction and amplitude of said variations.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that a gain value is chosen on

the basis of several selected digital words
corresponding respectively to several signals received

by a same acquisition device.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the digital word

representative of the energy of the signals received is
selected by making a direct comparison of the digital

words produced successively over a selected time
period.
A method as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the digital word representative

of the energy of the signals received is selected by
means of a comparison after each cycle of the digital

words produced during a selected period of time.
A device for acquiring signals picked up by
seismic receivers with automatic cyclic matching

performed at regular intervals, dependent on the
duration of successive seismic transmission-reception

cycles, of the gain to be applied thereto, comprising
at least one acquisition device (Ai) positioned in an

exploration zone in order to collect the signals
received by one or more seismic receivers (Ril-Rik) 

coupled with the formations in response to applied
vibrations, this device having at least one amplifier

(PA) linked to gain switching circuits and likely to
apply a certain number p of different amplification

gains (gl, g2, ..., gp) to the seismic signals,
digitising means (AD) of the over-sampling type

producing successive digital words, storage means (M)
for the digital words produced, a control unit

including a processing unit (2, 7) and means for
transmitting data on a transmission channel,

characterised in that it has gain control means
designed to:


select from the digital words produced, at least
during one cycle, one digital word representative

of the maximum energy of at least one seismic
signal received by each acquisition device,
compare the selected digital word with several
digital words representative of threshold values

delimiting several ranges of scale of variation
permitted by the digitising means,
choose the optimum gain value applicable to the
amplifier for at least one subsequent cycle, and
command the switching circuits to select this
optimum gain value.
A device as claimed in the preceding claim,
characterised in that each acquisition device has a

processing unit (2, 7) to select the digital words.
