<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a composition for inhibiting production of 
IgE comprising, as an active ingredient, a peptide which is 

capable of binding to human IgE, more specifically the high-affinity 
immunoglobulin E receptor α-chain or its soluble 

fragment capable of binding to human IgE. The composition is 
clinically useful for blocking allergic responses.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel use of peptides
which are capable of binding to human immunoglobulin E (IgE).
More particularly, the invention relates to a use of a soluble
fragment of a high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor α-chain
(sFcεRIα) which is capable of binding to human IgE for
inhibiting production of IgE.B-cells existing in the peripheral lymphoid tissue
(spleen and lymph node) carry immunoglobulin on its surface
which functions as an antigen-specific receptor. B-cells
develop into antibody-producing cells by antigenic stimulation.
In this instance, there are two developing systems: one
requires help of helper T-cells (T-dependent antibody
production); and the other requires no help of them (T-independent
antibody production), depending on the types of
antigen to mount immune response. It is considered that B-cells
involved in these immune reactions can also be divided
into subset. When B-cells develop into antibody-producing
cells, IgE and the like are produced.IgE is immunoglobulin bearing allergic reaction to
cause hyper-IgE syndrome including bronchial asthma, pollen
allergy, atopic dermatitis, non-allergic Kimura's disease
(angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia), other pulmonary 
diseases and autoimmune diseases, to which much attention has
been paid from the clinical viewpoint.Immunoglobulin is composed of Fab fragment which forms
an antigen binding site and Fc fragment which binds to the
corresponding receptor. IgE binds to mast cells and basophils
at the Fc fragment and therefore is called "cytotropic
antibody". A high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (FcεRI)
is a glycoprotein molecule manifesting on the surface of mast
cells and basophils and specifically binds to the Fc fragment
of IgE with high affinity (Ka = 109 to 1010 M-1). When a
corresponding polyvalent antigen binds to FcεRI-bound IgE, the
cells are activated and causes degranulation to release
physiologically active substances such as histamine, serotonin,
SRS-A (slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis) and the like.
These substances function to enhance vascular permeability,
contract smooth muscle and promote secretion of mucus to
thereby cause type-I allergic symptoms.Urea-denatured antigen is known to inhibit production
of IgE. The urea-denatured antigen inhibits the IgE production
reaction by increasing suppressor T cells which suppress helper
T cell activity to thereby prevent differentiation of B cells
to antibody-producing cells. Suplatast tosilate is also known
as a substance capable of inhibiting the
