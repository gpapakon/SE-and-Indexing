<DESCRIPTION>
 AZABRICYCLIC COMPOUNDS AS CALCIUM CHANNEL ANTAGONISTSThe present invention relates to the use of known and novel azabicyclic derivatives in therapy, in particular as calcium channel antagonists, novel compounds pa: .S£» processes for their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.US Patent No.4,599,344 describes quinuclidines of the formula :wherein Rj is inter alia hydrogen, R-2 is hydrogen or ALK-Z and R3 is hydrogen or ALK"-Z, where ALK is C2-4alkyl, ALK" is Cj^alkyl and Z is a mono- or- di-substituted phenyl ring. These compounds are said to be antiarrhythmic agents.Ricciardi and Doukas (Heterocycles, Vol 24, No 4, p971, 1986) describe certain styrylquinuclidines, which are said to inhibit cholineacetyl-transferase in vitro.German OLS 41 16582 describes azabicyclic compounds of the formulawherein A, B and C independently represent -CH2- or a single bond; n is zero, 1 or 2; X is oxygen or sulphur and R is inter alia phenylalkyl, diphenylalkyl, heterocyclicalkyl, phenyl, diphenyl or a heterocycle, each of which may be optionally substituted. These compounds are said to be useful as muscaiinic antagonists.EPA 497415 describes 3-(substituted phenoxy and substituted phenylthio)quinuclidines, wherein the phenyl substitutent is selected from inter alia lower alkoxy, lower aralkyloxy, halogen, NO2, CF3, CN and NRjR2, which compounds are said to be muscarinic agonists. 

 e have now found that certain substituted azabicyclic derivatives, including some of the above compounds, exhibit activity as calcium channel antagonists. They are thus of potential use in the treatment of disorders where calcium channel blockade is indicated, in particular disorders related to an accumulation of calcium in the brain cells of mammals.The present invention therefore provides, in a -first aspect, the use of a compound of formula (I):Formula (I)in whichp, q and r each independently represent an integer from 1 to 4; A is a bond, -CH=CH-, -C≡C-, oxygen, sulphur or NR , where R! is hydrogen, Cι_galkyl orphenylCι_4alkyl;n is 0 to 6, and m is 0 to 6, such that the length of the chain -(CH2)nA(CH2)m is at least two atoms; andAr is aryl or heteroaryl, each of which may be optionally substituted;or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of disorders where a calcium channel antagonist is indicated.The H atom is shown on the bridgehead carbon atom to make clear that the (CH2)nA(CH2)mAr chain cannot be attached at this position.The compounds of formula (I)
