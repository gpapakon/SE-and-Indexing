<ABSTRACT>
A variable temperature NMR probe comprises a RF coil 
(7) surrounding a sample position (14) and a fluid jacket 

(2) for conveying fluid to control the temperature at the 
sample position. The probe further comprises a RF electromagnetic 

shield (3) preventing fluid in the fluid conveying 
means from affecting a NMR signal from the sample position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a variable temperature 
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probe. In pulsed NMR, the sample resides in a radio frequency 
(RF) coil of which the magnetic field axis is perpendicular 
to a constant external magnetic field which may be 
generated by a permanent magnet as in the QP20 manufactured 
by Oxford Instruments Limited, or by other means. The 
sample is irradiated by a radio frequency magnetic field 
pulse via the RF coil. This causes the magnetisation of 
the sample to precess around the external magnetic field 
with a frequency which is specific for each kind of nucleus 
(and proportional to the external magnetic field). After 
the applied pulse has finished the still precessing 
magnetisation of the sample induces a radio frequency 
voltage in the RF coil which is detected and which is the 
useful signal. For proton NMR all materials used in the 
neighbourhood of the RF coil should be proton free as 
otherwise the proton signal of these materials will overlay 
the signal of the sample. In addition, electrically 
conductive materials in the neighbourhood of the RF coil 
should only be used with care and avoided where possible as 
they disturb the RF field by eddy currents and reduce the 
quality factor of the coil. Preferred materials for coil 
formers and sample tubes for proton NMR are therefore: 
glass, ceramic, and the two proton free plastics polytetrafluoroethene 
(Teflon) and polychlorotrifluoroethene (Kel-F). There is a need to provide a variable temperature (VT) 
NMR probe comprising a radio frequency coil, and means for 
cooling/heating a sample within the coil to enable NMR 
measurements to be performed at desired sample 
temperatures. A known probe which achieves this has a 
liquid jacket which surrounds the RF coil and the sample. 
The problem with this kind of VT probe is the fact that 
proton free liquids need to be used to prevent a proton NMR  
 
signal originating from the liquid. These are in general 
perfluorinated/chlorinated hydrocarbons which have the 
disadvantages of being expensive, having a small specific 
heat capacity and evaporating quickly if the whole system 
cannot be hermetically sealed. In addition, those liquids 
should be avoided due to their impact on the environment. In accordance with the present invention, a variable 
temperature NMR probe comprises a RF coil surrounding a 
sample position; and fluid conveying means for conveying 
fluid to control the temperature at the sample position and 
is characterised in that the probe further
