<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optically active monomer and
a liquid crystal polymer thereof suitable for forming a liquid crystal
display, and to an optical element having a circular dichroism using the
polymer.A polarizing film prepared by adsorbing a dichromatic dye, etc.,
to a stretched film, such as a stretched polyvinyl alcohol film, etc.,
cannot be effectively used because at least 50% of an incident light is
absorbed, and thus it is difficult to increase a luminance and decrease
a consumed electric power of a liquid crystal display device, etc. As a
result, an optical element having a circular dichroism has been
expected. This is because a helical axis of a liquid crystal molecule
causes a vertical grandjean orientation to the optical element, in the
natural light striking in parallel to the helical axis (incident angle: 0
degree), about a half of the light of a certain wavelength is reflected as
a right (or left) circularly polarized light, residual about a half of the
light is transmitted as a left (or right) circularly polarized light, the
wavelength λ is determined by the equation λ = n · p (wherein n is a
mean refractive index of liquid crystal and p is helical pitch of a
cholesteric phase), the right or left reflected circularly polarized light is 
determined by the helical state of the cholesteric phase and coincides
with the circulation direction of the helix, and thus there is a possibility
that the reflected light can be utilized in addition to the transmitted
light by the separation of the natural light as described above.Hitherto, as an optical element having a circular dichroism, an
optical element formed by enclosing a liquid cholesteric liquid crystal
made up of a low molecular weight material between substrates such
as glasses in an oriented state and an optical element made up of a
liquid crystal polymer showing a cholesteric liquid crystal phase are
known as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication (unexamined) No.
55-21479 and U.S. Patent 5,332,522.However, in the former low molecular weight material, because
substrates are used, the optical element becomes thick and heavy and
there is a problem of hindering light-weighting and thinning of the
liquid crystal display. Also, there is a problem that the orientation
state of the liquid crystal, for example, a pitch thereof is liable to be
changed by the change of temperature, etc.On the other hand, in the case of using the latter liquid crystal
polymer, it is difficult to obtain a sold material such as a film of a good
oriente
