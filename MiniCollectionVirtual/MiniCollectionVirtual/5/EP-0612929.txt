<ABSTRACT>
A connecting system which includes a pilot clutch (Pc) brought 
into an engaged state by an actuator (e.g. an electro magnet) (31), 

a cam member (27) operated by 
an engaging force of the pilot clutch (Pc), an urging member (22) driven 

and moved by the cam member, and a main clutch (Mc) brought into an 
engaged state by a movement of the urging member (22). The cam member 

includes a first cam ring (27) restrained by the pilot clutch, a 
second cam ring (33) provided on the urging member (22), and rolling 

members (34) interposed the first and second cam rings (27,33) for 
converting 

the relative rotation of the cam rings into a thrust. The system 
further includes a biasing member (23) for biasing the urging member (22) 

and the first cam ring (27) in a direction of abutment against each 
other in order to generate a frictional force between the urging 

member (22) and the first cam ring (27). Thus, it is possible to prevent 
the engaging force of the main clutch (Mc) from being influenced by 

a drag torque produced in the pilot clutch (Pc).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a connecting system,
including a pilot clutch brought into an engaged state by an
actuator, a cam means operated by an engaging force of the pilot
clutch, an urging member driven and moved by the cam means, and
a main clutch brought into an engaged state by a movement of the
urging member, the cam means including a first cam ring
restrained by the pilot clutch, a second cam ring provided on the
urging member, and a rolling member interposed between the first
and second cam rings for converting the relative rotation of the
cam rings into a thrust.There are such conventionally known connecting systems
described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Nos. 219123/91
and 107347/92. These conventional connecting systems were applied to a
differential motion limiting mechanism in a differential in an
automobile so as to control the differential motion limiting
mechanism, by utilizing an engaging force of the pilot clutch
and bringing the main clutch into its engaged state. In the above prior art connecting systems, a drag torque may
be generated, in some cases, in the pilot clutch, due to the
viscosity of oil, particularly at a low temperature, or the
like. This drag torque may be applied to the first cam ring to
bring about a relative rotation between both the first and second
cam rings, thereby bringing the main clutch into its engaged
state to generate a differential motion limiting force larger
than necessary.Document US-4 645 049 discloses a connecting system comprising a
first clutch brought into an engaged state by a release bearing,
a thrust generator operated by an engaging force of the first
clutch, a pressure plate driven and moved by the thrust generator,
and a second clutch brought into an engaged state by a movement
of the pressure plate. The thrust generator comprises a first cam
plate restrained by the first clutch, a second cam plate provided
on the pressure plate, and thrust balls interposed between the
first and second cam plates for converting the relative rotation
of both the cam plates into a thrust. The system further includes
a clutch spring for biasing the pressure plate and said first cam
plate toward an abutment against each other in order to generate
a frictional force between the pressure plate and said first cam
plate by said abutment and a spline connection between the first
cam plate and a further disk incorporating free motion for
providing a dead zone in an operation of the cam plates.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
