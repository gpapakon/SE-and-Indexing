<ABSTRACT>
When preparing powdered or granulated detergent composition having a high apparent density, an ulterior treatment is required in order to improve its solubility. For that purpose, the prefabricated powder or granulate having over 500 g/l apparent density is contacted while stirring with a liquid or solid, hydrophobic and/or water-insoluble component which is not a zeolite. The weight ratio between the prefabricated powder and the liquid or solid, hydrophobic and/or water-insoluble treatment agent is set between 20 : 1 and 2000 : 1.

water-insoluble treatment agent being adjusted to between 20:1 and 2000:1

A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that a

detergent compound produced by spray drying and optionally post-compaction
or a mixture thereof with other detergent ingredients, more

particularly non-spray-dryable detergent ingredients, is used as the prepared

A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a
detergent or detergent compound produced by extrusion of a homogeneous

compound, optionally in the presence of a plasticizer, through multiple-bore
dies preferably having a bore diameter of 0.5 mm to 5 mm to form strands,

size reduction of the extrudate by a cutting unit and subsequent treatment in
a rounding unit, or a mixture thereof with other detergent ingredients, is used

as the prepared washing-active formulation.
A process as claimed in claim 7, characterized in that the treatment
