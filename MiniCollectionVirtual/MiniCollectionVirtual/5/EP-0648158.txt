<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for simultaneously
forming a plurality of profiled tubes in a single
travelling mold tunnel. The profiled tube may be for
example, ribbed tube or corrugated tube such as single
walled corrugated tube or double walled corrugated
tube having a corrugated outer wall and a smooth inner
wall.Corrugated thermoplastic tube may be made an
apparatus of the travelling mold tunnel tube with vacuum
forming as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent
No. 4,226,580 issued October 7th, 1980 to Gerd P.H.
Lupke and Manfred A. A. Lupke, U.S. Patent No.
4,319,872 issued March 16, 1982 to Manfred A. A.
Lupke, U.S. Patent No. 3,538,209, issued November 3,
1970 to W. Hegler and U.S. Patent No. 5,002,478, to
Manfred A. A. Lupke on March 26, 1991. Numerous
other patents generally concern travelling mold type
apparatus for forming profiled tube. The patents
referred to are intended to be merely exemplary of the
large number in the field.A travelling mold tunnel may often be utilized for
molding tube of different diameters by substitution of the
mold blocks or by the use of interchangeable mold
blocks as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,325,685,
issued on April 20, 1982 to Manfred A. A. Lupke. However,
a necessary criterion for such tunnels is that they
be of sufficient size and power to accommodate the
largest mold blocks which it is expected to use. Such
mold tunnels are large and may be uneconomic in use
for molding tube of very small diameter using small
mold blocks.One reason for the any reduced efficiency in the
molding of small diameter tube is due to the utilization of
the cooling capacity of the machine. This is measured in
terms of the weight of tube which can be produced on
the machine during a given period. If large molds are
used in a travelling mold tunnel, the tunnel will be run at
a slower speed than when small molds are used. Nevertheless,
efficiency of the machine may be greater for the
large molds since a greater weight of material may be
processed using the cooling capacity of the machine
efficiently. For the greater speeds and lesser weights of
material processed in small molds, problems arise in
utilizing the cooling capacity fully.Further problems may arise in the provision of carrier
means for the mold blocks suitable for use with very
large mold blocks and for small mold blocks.It has frequently been found desirable to utilize different
travelling mold tunnels for molding large diameter
tube and small diameter tube resulting, for some users
in the capital expense of
