<DESCRIPTION>
 OPTICALLY NON-LINEAR MATERIALS The present invention relates to novel optically non-linear materials, to methods for their synthesis and to optical devices which incorporate such materials.Film-forming hemicyanines dyes of general formula D-C6H4-CH=CH-C5H4N+-R X where D is an electron donating group, R is an al yl group and X~ is a simple inorganic anion such as a halide ion have been extensively studied for second harmonic generation (SHG). Their properties are dependent in part upon the extent of aggregation within the Langmuir-Blodgett film structures and in part upon the position of the anion. Girling e al_. (Thin Solid Films 132, 101 1985) and Schildkraut et al_. (Opt. Lett 13, 134, 1988) have disclosed that the SHG may be enhanced by mixing the dye with a fatty acid. The dilution of the chromophores suppresses the tendency of molecules to aggregate, but as a disadvantage there may be phase separation of the components of the mixed film. We have now discovered that Langmui -Blodgett film structures which generate a signal of greater intensity may be produced by utilising an amphiphilic anion rather than a simple inorganic anion. Film forming hemicyanine dyes comprising an amphiphilic anion are believed to be novel and constitute one aspect of this invention. Preferred anions are a phiphiles of the formula R-Z~ or R-ιr-Z_ wherein R represents a hydrophobic group comprising from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, -a represents a conjugated or aromatic bridging group and Z represents a negatively charged group such as a carboxylate, sulphate or sulphonate. Preferred examples of bridging group π are -CH=CH-, -CH=N-, -N=N, -Ar- wherein Ar represents an aromatic ring especially a benzene ring or a pyridine ring. Amongst ne compounds which are potentially useful as amphiphilic an jns are anionic surfactants especially the monobasic anionic surfactants such as soaps, alkylbenzene sulphonates, olefin sulphonates, alcohol sulphates and alkoxylated alcohol sulphates, alkoxylated alkylphenol sulphates, sulphated acids, amides and esters and sulphated natural oils and fats. The preferred 

amphiphiles for use in the present invention are soaps, alkyl benzene sulphonates, alcohol sulphates and ethoxylated alcohol sulphates.The materials of this invention may comprise any amphiphilic cationic dye of general formula D-ιr-A+X~ wherein D represents an electron donating group; ir represents a conjugated bridging group; A+ represents an electron accepting group and X" represents the amphiphilic anion.One preferred grouping of
