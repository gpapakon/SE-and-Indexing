<ABSTRACT>
The pneumatic radial tire of the invention has a 
pair of bead portions (20) containing bead cores (12) 

therein and is characterized in that the bead core (12) 
is constructed by substantially winding at least one 

metal wire, and a bead toe reinforcing rubber stock (18) 
with a JIS hardness of 80° - 98° is arranged inward of 

the bead core (12) in an axial direction of the tire, 
the width (L2) of the bead toe reinforcing rubber stock 

(18) is in a range of 0.5 - 2.0 times the width (L3) of 
the bead core (12) in the axial direction, and the width 

(L1) from the outer edge of the bead core (12) to the 
inner edge of the bead portion (20) in the axial 

direction of the tire is in a range of 1. 1 - 3. 0 times 
the width (L3) of the bead core (12) in the axial 

direction of the tire, and the side region in the axial 
direction of the tire and the inner region in the radial 

direction of the tire around the bead core and the bead 
toe reinforcing rubber stock (18) is substantially 

reinforced by a chafer (22) made of organic fiber cords.
 

Thus there is provided a pneumatic radial tire with 
improved riding comfortability and cornering performance 

without increase of the weight.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pneumatic radial tire, 
more particularly to a pneumatic radial tire which can 
improve cornering performance at high speed running and 
riding comfortability as well. Recently, improvement of road networks, high power 
of cars and enhancement of performance have tended to 
increase car speed more and more. While the running 
performance at a high speed on straight roads and 
highways is as a matter of course satisfactory, the 
cornering performance is on the other hand a problem in 
such cars. That is, there is a need for performance 
which guarantees cornering at a high speed with 
safety. In general, as a measure for improvement of 
cornering performance, strengthening the rigidity of the 
region around bead base portions by providing 
reinforcing layers extending from this region to an area 
in a sidewall portion having maximum width has been 
suggested. By adopting such reinforcing layers, though the 
rigidity apparently increases, on the contrary 
disadvantages caused by weight, cost and further 
deterioration of the riding comfortability were found 
upon actual running of the car.  
 Having regard to the above, it is an object of this 
invention to provide a pneumatic radial tire which has 
improved riding comfortability and cornering performance 
without increasing weight of the tire. US-A-5 186 772 discloses a radial tire showing the features 
of the preamble of claim 1. The present invention provides a pneumatic radial 
tire, comprising: a tread portion, a pair of bead 
portions containing bead cores therein, at least one 
carcass layer comprising organic fiber cords arranged 
substantially at an angle of 90° with respect to a 
circumferential direction of the tire, and a belt layer 
comprising two layers intersecting each other at a 
relatively small angle with respect to the 
circumferential direction of the tire and arranged in a 
crown region of the tire and radially outward of the 
said carcass layer; wherein the bead core 
is constructed by substantially winding at least one 
metal wire, and a bead toe reinforcing rubber stock with 
a JIS hardness of 80° - 98° is arranged inward of the 
bead core in an axial direction of the tire, the width 
of the bead toe reinforcing rubber stock is in a range 
of 0.5 - 2.0 times the width of the bead core in the 
axial direction, and the width from the outer edge of 
the bead core to the inner edge of the bead portion in 
the axial direction of the tire is in a range of 1.1 - 
3.0 times the width of the bead core in the
