<ABSTRACT>
A foot-operated faucet including a bulb (1) 
which can be compressed by foot to create and transfer 

air pressure through a hose (3) onto a membrane (81) in a 
valve body (8) mounted on a general faucet (42), whereby 

the membrane (81) can be expanded to push a ball plug 
(15) away, permitting water to flow, and when the bulb 

(1) is released, the air pressure is eliminated and the 
faucet is shut off. A switch (25) is disposed on the 

valve body and connected with a lever (18), whereby when 
the switch (25) is rotated, the lever moves the ball plug 

away, permitting the water to flow continuously.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foot-operated 
faucet and more particularly to a faucet fitted on an 
outlet of a water supply, such as a general faucet, 
including a compressible bulb which can be compressed 
by foot to create and transfer air pressure through a 
hose to a valve body mounted on a general faucet, so as 
to open the valve to permit the water to flow out. U.K. Patent No. 1590757 discloses a remotely 
controlled valve which includes a foot-operated control 
member capable of creating air pressure by way of 
compression and transferring the air pressure through a 
guide pipe to a pressure inlet for pushing away a 
piston. The piston then moves away a ball valve so as to 
permit the water to flow out. When the control member is 
released, the piston is restored to its original 
position by a spring and the ball valve moves under the 
water pressure to again block the water outlet. Some drawbacks in the above arrangement are as 
follow: 
1. When the piston contacts the surrounding wall too  
 
loosely, a leak will take place, while when the piston 
contacts the wall too closely, the piston will suffer 
greater frictional force when moved and thus cannot be 
easily operated. 2. The water outlet blocked by the ball valve is located 
on a lateral side and the ball valve blocks the outlet 
due to the water pressure, so that when the water 
pressure is lowered, due to the gravity , the ball 
valve will drop and fail to completely block the water 
outlet, making a part of water leak through the 
clearance between the ball valve and the outlet. 3. The remotely controlled valve can be only operated 
for temporary water discharging while when the water is 
to be discharged for a long time, the user must 
continuously step on the foot-operated member. Moreover, 
the structure of the remotely controlled valve is too 
complicated and thus cannot be easily assembled. Also, 
the foot-compressed structure of such valve is rough 
and the manufacturing cost thereof is high. It is therefore desirable 
to provide a foot-operated faucet which can control the 
amount of the discharged water in a foot-stepping 
manner. It is further desirable to provide to a faucet a 
rotary switch, permitting the faucet to discharge water 
for a long time.  It is also desirable to have a faucet which can 
be directly and easily fitted to a water supply. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a faucet comprising a body defining a chamber 
having an inlet and an outlet, a ball valve located in 
the chamber for

<CLAIMS>
A foot-operated faucet comprising: 
   a body defining a chamber having an inlet and an 

outlet; 
   a ball valve located in said chamber for closing 

said outlet by a ball under the influence of its weight; 
   a first actuation mechanism attached to said 

body and having a flexible member operable by a 
compressed fluid for displacing said ball from closing 

said outlet; 
   a compressible member in fluid communication 

with said first actuation mechanism for supplying said 
compressed fluid to said flexible member; and 

   a second actuation mechanism attached to said 
body and being arranged to displace said ball by 

mechanical means. 
A foot-operated faucet according to claim 1, 
wherein said flexible member includes a membrane, a push 

rod movable with said membrane and elastic means for 
urging said membrane and push rod away from displacing 

said ball, so that the ball is displaced to open said 
outlet only when the membrane is under the pressure of 

said compressed fluid. 
A foot-operated faucet according to claim 1 or 
claim 2, wherein said mechanical means comprises a lever 

 
member located in said chamber and being movable therein 

and a handle attached to said body and associated with 
said lever member so that said lever member can be moved 

via said handle to engage and displace said ball. 
A foot-operated faucet comprising: 

a) a valve body defining an inlet, a valve 
chamber communicating with the inlet and an outlet 

communicating with the valve chamber and having a valve 

seat adjacent to the outlet; 
b) a ball plug located in the valve chamber 
such that it is biased against the valve seat by gravity 

to close the outlet; 
c) a first valve actuation means comprising: 

i) a push rod slidably located in the valve 
body so as to be movable between a retracted position in 

which it is out of contact with the ball plug and an 
extended position in which it displaces the ball plug off 

the valve seat to open the outlet; 
ii) a flexible membrane operatively connected 
to the push rod and the valve body; and, 
iii) foot operated pneumatic bulb means 
operatively associated with the flexible membrane so as 

to move the push rod between its retracted and extended 
positions; and, 
d) a second valve actuation means 
comprising: 


i) a lever actuator rotatably attached to 
 

the valve body, the lever movable between a first 
position in which the ball plug is permitted to seat on 

the valve seat to close the opening and a second position 
in which the lever displaces the ball plug from the valve 

seat so as to open the opening; and, 
ii) manually manipulable handle means located 
externally of the valve body and operatively connected to 

the lever actuator so as to move the lever between its 
first and second positions.

body to a faucet. 
The foot-operated faucet of claim 5 wherein the 
attachment means comprises:
