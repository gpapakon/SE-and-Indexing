<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an edger rolling mill 
preferably disposed in a universal rolling facility for use 
to hot-roll a shape, such as an H-shape having a web and 
flanges, and formed by combining a universal rolling mill 
and an edger rolling mill. In general, when a shape, such as an H-shape having a 
web and flanges, is manufactured by continuous rolling, a 
raw material to be rolled to manufacture the shape, such as 
a bloom or a beam blank, has been rolled by a universal 
rolling facility which combines a universal rolling mill 
and an edger rolling mill. In this case, the edger rolling 
mill acts to roll the flanges of the H-shape to bring the 
flange width of the H-shape to a predetermined dimension. 
There is known in the prior art a type of the edger rolling 
mill which comprises a housing formed independently from 
the housing for the universal rolling mill and which has 
kaliber-type edging rolls for collectively restricting the 
web surfaces, the inside surfaces of the flanges and the 
end surfaces of the flanges of the raw material to be 
rolled. There is known an attached-edger type rolling mill in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 63-303604. It has an 
arrangement wherein drum-type edger rolls are included in 
the housing of a universal rolling mill to restrict only 
the end surfaces of the flanges of a raw material to be 
rolled. However, an edging rolling mill of the foregoing 
conventional type has a problem which will be described by 
making reference to the accompanying drawings. Usually, the H-shape is manufactured in such a manner 
that a raw material to be rolled, such as a slab 71 or 
bloom 72 or a beam blank 73 obtained by continuous casting  
 
as shown in Figs. 6A, 6B and 6C, is inserted into a heating 
furnace 80 shown in Fig. 7A so as to be heated to a 
predetermined level. Then, it is rolled to a rough form 
having a web and flanges by a rough rolling mill 81. A 
rough universal rolling mill 82 and an edger rolling mill 
83 are used to reverse-roll the rough steel member several 
times. As an alternative to this, two roughing universal 
rolling mills 83 are disposed as shown in Fig. 7B and an 
edger rolling mill 83 is disposed between the two roughing 
universal rolling mills 82 to perform reverse rolling. As 
a result, the thicknesses of the web and flange portions of 
the raw material are gradually decreased as shown in Figs. 
8A and 8B so that the desired dimensions of the H-shape are 
realized. Then, a finish universal mill 84 is used to 
manufacture a final

<CLAIMS>
An edging roll for rolling a shape having a web 
and flanges and comprising: 


a main shaft (1) having a shaft portion in which its 
central axis coincides with a central axis of rotation and 

an eccentric shaft portion formed at substantially the 
central portion of said shaft portion and made to be 

eccentric with respect to said central axis of rotation; 
an eccentric sleeve (2) attached to surround either 
shaft portion of two shaft portions on both sides of said 

eccentric shaft portion of said main shaft to be slidable 
in an axial direction and having an eccentric portion
