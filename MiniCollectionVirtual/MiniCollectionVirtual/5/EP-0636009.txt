<ABSTRACT>
A patient (1) is provided with a sensor patch (2) which is worn on the skin of the chest of the patient. The sensor patch (2) includes a central structural support member (8) formed of a flexible, but rigid, plastics material. The structural member (8) is surrounded by an adhesive gel (9) which is preferably a hydrogel compound. The patch (2) is provided with a number of electrodes (10), for example four, which are positioned on the gel (9) so as to contact the skin of the patient (1) when the gel (9) adheres to the skin. The electrodes (10) are either metallic, such as stainless steel, or formed of a silver chloride compound and are electrically connected by connections (11) to an electronic package (12), which includes a power supply, circuitry for receiving ECG signals from the electrodes (10), for conditioning the signals to provide a conditioned signal and a short range radio transmitter to transmit the conditioned signal to the portable monitor unit (3) which is nearby. The portable monitor unit (3) includes circuitry for interfacing with a telephone line (4) to send the ECG data signals to a central monitoring station (5) by the telephone line (4). The portable unit (3) preferably also has monitoring circuitry for monitoring the incoming ECG data signal to determine whether there is any abnormality and to alert the patient if an abnormality in the ECG data signal is detected. The central monitoring station (5) includes a part (6) that decodes the ECG data signals received from the portable unit (3) via the telephone line (4) and performs beat and rhythm analysis for classification of the ECG data. Periodically, data is reviewed by a professional skilled in the field and a report generated (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system that is used to
monitor and analyse electrocardiogram signals remotely from patients
located in non-hospital sites.As used herein, the term "electro-cardiogram" (ECG) refers to an
electrical signal from the heart which may be measured from two or more
sensors placed on the patients skin, either on a limb or about the
patient's thorax.The term "complex" refers to a period of ECG signal which, when
voltage amplitude is plotted against time, exhibits a shape which may
be repeated in other epochs. Typically, a complex will include a
particular amplitude maxima or minima which is termed the detect
point. The rate at which detect points occur in a particular ECG
signal is the same as the heart rate. The term 'normal complex' refers
to a complex in an ECG signal that is regularly repeated and is
measured at electrodes placed on a person whose heart is beating in
Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR). The shape of a normal complex may vary from
patient to patient and between ECG signals recorded from different
sites on the same patient.The terms P, Q, R, S and T when used herein in relation to ECG
complexes refer to portions of a normal complex that relate to
particular electro-physiological events in the cardiac cycle.The term "normal rate" for a particular patient refers to a range
of heart rates that is typical for a healthy individual of similar age
to the patient when at rest.The term "arrhythmia" relates to an abnormal rhythm of the heart
that persists for multiple complexes which may or may not revert to
normal sinus rhythm spontaneously. An arrhythmia may be made up of
normal complexes at a rate that is abnormally high for the patient or
abnormally low or, alternatively, an arrhythmia may consist of abnormal
complexes at a high, low or normal rate.In known systems as for example GB-A-2 207 579, the patient is provided with sensors attached
to the patient's body and which are coupled by electrical leads to an
event recorder. The event recorder then sends the ECG signals to the
monitoring system via a telecommunications line, e.g. a telephone line.A major disadvantage of these known systems is that continuous
monitoring of a patient has been met with a distinct lack of enthusiasm 
by the patient due to the need for a lead to connect the sensors to the
event recorder. This causes discomfort and difficulties in dressing and
washing, and also some embarrassment as it is difficult to hide from
view.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
system whereby a patient can have
