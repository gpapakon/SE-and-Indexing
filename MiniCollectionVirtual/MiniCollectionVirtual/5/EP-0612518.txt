<DESCRIPTION>
Over the years there has been a constant evolution of cleansing compositions for 
the human skin. From the basic use of lye soap to the more advanced combars and 
synthetic detergents compositions in both liquid and solid form, there has been a constant 
quest for improved compositions having better cleansing activity but with increased 
mildness to the skin as well as inter alia, better sensory attributes. Although sulfates and carboxylates are still commonly used as surfactants, in the 
last few years attention has been drawn to phosphates utilized for that function. USP 
4,139,485 issued February 13, 1979 to Kao Corporation is directed to a composition 
utilized for skin care employing a mixture of two different phosphates, a monoalkyl 
phosphate and dialkylphosphate, the proportion of the dialkyl phosphate, if present at all, 
to be no more than 20 weight percent of the total mono and dialkylphosphate. Above 20 
weight percent. the composition is stated to have substantially inferior foaming properties, 
water solubility and is unsuitable for use in detergent compositions of that invention, see 
column 7, lines 46-55 of USP 4,139,485. Recently USP 5,139,781 issued August 18, 
1992 to Cheseborough Ponds disclosed that the special proportions of 
monoalkylphosphate to dialkylphosphate necessary for proper foaming, water solubility 
and mildness of the previously mentioned Kao USP 4,139,485 were not necessary as 
long as there was at least one of a very limited family of co-surfactants 
also present in the 
composition. These cosurfactants were limited to either an alkylamidopropyl betaine or 
an alkylamphoglycinate. A host of additional supplementary surfactants could also be 
present but the two previously mentioned betaines or glycinates were critical to improving 
the foaming of the compositions as measured by foam height, perceived volume and 
creaminess. The additional supplementary surfactants were exhaustively described at 
column 5, line 25 through column 9, line 52 of the 781 patent. It has now been discovered that a new cosurfactant group can be combined with 
mono and dialkylphosphate, ethoxylated or not, with levels of dialkylphosphate 
significantly above 20 wt%, as measured by total wt% mono and dialkyl phosphate and 
obtain a detergent composition which is mild, water soluble and produces a foam which 
enhances cleaning, and has specific advantages in flash foaming and total foam height.  
 In accordance with the invention, there is a composition suitable for topical 
application to the
