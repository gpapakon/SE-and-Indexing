<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a plastic blow
molded container having a freestanding base structure
for supporting the container while being capable of
withstanding internal pressure.Conventional plastic blow molded containers
for holding carbonated beverages that pressurize the
container for the most part in the past have been
manufactured as base cup containers wherein the lower
extremity of the blow molded container has a
hemispherical shape that is received within an injection
molded plastic base cup which supports the container
during use. Such a base cup permits the hemispherical
shape to be utilized to provide the requisite strength
for withstanding the internal pressure while still
providing a flat surface on which the container can be
supported in an upright position. While such containers
function satisfactorily, there is a cost involved in
both manufacturing and assembling the base cup to the
blow molded container and such cost must necessarily be
included in the price to the consumer.Blow molded containers capable of withstanding
pressure have also been manufactured with freestanding
base structures that are unitary with the container body
such as disclosed by United States Patents: 3,598,270
Adomaitis; 3,727,783 Carmichael; 3,759,410 Uhilig;
3,871,541 Adomaitis; and 3,935,955 Das. These patents
disclose relatively early attempts to design a
freestanding blow molded container capable of 
withstanding internal pressure by the provision of
circumferentially spaced legs having lower feet on which the
container is supported.More recent plastic blow molded containers having
freestanding base structures are disclosed by German
Offenlegungsschrift 29 20 122 and by United States Patents:
4,249,667 Pocock et al; 4,267,144 Collette et al; 4,276,987
Michel; 4,294,366 Chang; 4,318,489 Synder et al; 4,335,821
Collette et al; 4,368,825 Motill; 4,785,949 Krishnakumar et
al; 4,785,950 Miller et al; 4,850,494 Howard, Jr.; 4,850,493
Howard Jr.; 4,867,323 Powers; and 4,910,054 Collette et al.Certain of the containers disclosed by the above patents
have flat feet on which the freestanding base structure is
supported. However, some of the structures involved deflect
under the pressure such that it is necessary to incline the
lower feet upwardly in an inward direction as disclosed by
United States Patent 4,865,206 Behm et al so that the feet
deflect downwardly to a coplanar relationship with each other
upon being subjected to the internal pressure when the
container is filled.Also, United Kingdom patent application GB
