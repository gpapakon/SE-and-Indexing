<ABSTRACT>
A process is disclosed whereby a sandy-argillaceous base material, for which waste moulding material is used, undergoes 
magnetic separation, crushing and sifting, the undersize product being removed and heat cured in an oxidizing environment 

at a predetermined temperature. The undersize and oversize products are then mixed with a binding agent and water in 
predetermined proportions to produce a raw mixture from which the artificial stone building blocks are formed by pressing 

followed by hardening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to methods 
for producing building materials and more specifically 
it concerns a method for producing artificial stone 
construction elements. At present both reclaiming toxic waste of foundry 
practice and producing cheap building materials become 
more and more important. According to the generally adopted technological 
foundry practice used up moulding sand are usually dumped 
and are not thus utilized afterwards This, however, 
involves considerable transport expenditures, provision 
of specially allotted areas, as well as deteriorates environmental 
situation due to the fact that used up moulding 
sand contains toxic substances, organic ones inclusive. That is why producing ecologically safe construction 
elements from foundry waste products, namely, those 
based on used up moulding sand, directly in the zone of 
foundry production itself may sulve the problem of utilization 
of foundry waste and add to the efficiency of 
foundry practice as a whole. One prior-art method for producing artificial stone 
construction elements (cf. advertising booklets of the 
firm 'CITADOB- ES', Belgium, 1989 "Production process of 
compressed-soil blocks of the "Adobe" and "Geoconcrete" 
types), is known to consist in that a sand-clay base is 
heated, kept at a preset temperature, crushed, and screened, 
whereupon the undersize product is mixed, in a 
preset ratio, with gravel, a binder, and water to produce 
a stock mix, wherefrom artificial stone construction  
 
elements are press-moulded and after-cured. According to the known method, used as a sand-clay 
base is natural soil containing sand, clay, organic inclusions, 
and gravel. First of all such a soil is dried 
to remove an excess amount of moisture, then crushed and 
screened. Then the oversize product is then picked up and made 
no use of subsequently. The undersize product is mixed, 
in preset proportions, with water, a binder in the 
capacity of which cement is used, and gravel until a 
stock mix is obtained, wherefrom artificial stone construction 
elements are press-moulded. The thus-produced 
construction elements are air-cured under outdoor conditions 
at the ambient temperature. Artificial stone construction elements produced by 
the known method are intended for use in arid climate 
zones only, and cannot be used under any other climate 
conditions unless they are provided with special coatings, 
this being due to natural swelling of the materials 
used in such construction elements in the presence 
of

A method for making artificial stone construction 
elements, consisting in that a sand-clay base is heated, 

kept at a preset temperature, crushed, and screened, 
while th
e undersize product is mixed, in a preset 
ratio, with gravel, a binder, and water until a stock 

mix isobtained, wherefrom artificial stone construction 
elements are made by press-moulding followed by curing, 

CHARACTERIZED in that used as said-clay base is a used 
up moulding sand, containing bentonite as a clayey component 

and having inclusions in the form of metal scrap, 
mould cores, and organic substances, at least part of 

these being toxic, use of said used up moulding sand being 
preceded by magnetic separation thereof to remove 

metal scrap therefrom, and crushing and screening of said 
moulding sand is carried out preparatory to heating; 

the oversize material is separated and used as gravel; 
heating and holding at a preset temperature under conditions 

of oxidizing roasting up to such a temperature and 
within such a period of time that provide for elimination 

of toxic substances therefrom. 
A method according to Claim 1, CHARACTERIZED in 
that the components for preparing the stock mix are taken 

in the following ratio (wt.%): 
undersize product of used moulding sand45 - 94.9 cement5 - 35 oversize product of used moulding sand0.1 - 20.0 water2 - 10 of the weight of dry stock mix. 
A method according to Claim 2, CHARACTERIZED in 
that in cases where the bentonite content of used up moulding 

sand is below 0.2 wt.%, bentonite is added, when 
preparing the stock mix, in an amount of 0.1 - 2 wt.% of 

 
the weight of dry stock mix. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
CHARACTERIZED in that the curing process is carried out 

by way of heat-and-wet treatment. 
A method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
CHARACTERIZED in that the process of oxidizing roasting 

is carried out at 200 - 350°C for 15 - 90 min. 
A method according to Claim 4, CHARACTERIZED in 
that the process of oxidizing roasting is carried out at 

200 - 350°C for 15 - 90 min. 
A method according to Claim 1, or 2, or 3, or 6, 
CHARACTERIZED in that the stock mix is compressed with a 

pressing force of 2500 - 6300 kN. 
A method according to Claim 1, or 2, or 3, or 6, 
CHARACTERIZED in that the stock mix is disintegrated and 

homogenized before compressing in order to ensure against 
lumping due to the presence of bentonite therein. 
A method according to Claim 7, CHARACTERIZED in 
that the stock mix is disintegrated and homogenized before 

compressing in order to ensure against lumping due 
to the presence of bentonite therein. 
A method according to Claim 1, or 2, or 3, or 6, 
or 9, CHARACTERIZED in that the stock mix after having 

been prepared be subjected to an additional magnetic separation.
