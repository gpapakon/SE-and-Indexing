<ABSTRACT>
The method reduces damage to the fuel cladding surface as the 
fuel rods are passed through an array of spacers; in particular, 

it prevents 
or greatly reduces the severity of longitudinal scratches 

on the fuel rods. The method uses thin-walled metallic 
tubes (28) having a wall thickness of 0.003 to 0.006 inch 

and a yield strength in excess of 140,000 psi. The 
predete
rmined tube thickness ensures that the tube 
remains elastic. The tube deflects the cell springs (26) 

when inserted in the spacer cells (25) and reduces the load 
exerted on the fuel rods (12); it is subsequently removed while 

holding the fuel rod in place.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the assembly 
of nuclear fuel bundles for service in a conventional 
boiling water reactor (BWR). In particular, the 
invention relates to a method of assembling fuel bundles 
which reduces and minimizes damage to the assembled 
components. Fissionable fuel materials such as oxides of 
uranium, plutonium or thorium, and combinations thereof, 
are typically formed into small cylindrical slugs or 
pellets and housed within sealed tubes or elongated 
containers sometimes referred to in the art as 
"cladding". The cladding protects the fuel from 
reacting with the coolant, or any foreign matter 
entrained therein, and prevents escape of any fission 
products, which are normally highly radioactive and 
corrosive, from the fuel into the coolant, thereby 
preventing contamination of the overall system. Thus 
the enduring integrity of the sealed cladding housing 
the fissionable fuel is crucial. Large-capacity power-generating nuclear fission 
reactor plants normally have several hundred sealed 
cladding tubes for housing fissionable fuel. To 
facilitate periodic refueling, which commonly is 
performed by replacing fractional portions of the total 
fuel at intervals and rearranging other fractional 
portions, these fuel rods or pins are conventionally  
 
assembled into bundles or groups of elements which can 
be handled and manipulated as a single composite unit. The fuel rods of each bundle are held mutually 
parallel and spaced apart by mechanical means. A 
typical fuel bundle comprises, for example, an 8 × 8 or 
9 × 9 array of spaced fuel rods. The cladding is 
usually more than 10 ft long, e.g., 14 ft, and 
approximately ½ inch in diameter, the cladding tubes 
being spaced from each other by a fraction of an inch. 
The spacing is required to permit an ample flow of heat-removing 
coolant, such as water, over the full exterior 
surface of the cladding for effective heat transfer and 
thus effective reactor operation. To inhibit the fuel rods from bowing and vibrating 
due to high heat and high velocities of coolant flowing 
thereabout, which could cause adjacent fuel rods to 
contact and in any case could impede or unbalance 
coolant flow, the fuel rods are retained in a spaced-apart 
array or relation by means of a plurality of 
spacing grids (hereinafter "spacers") positioned at 
intervals along the fuel rod length. A typical spacer comprises a plurality of parallel 
cells which are welded to each other and to a surrounding 
spacer band to form a lattice of cells. Each
