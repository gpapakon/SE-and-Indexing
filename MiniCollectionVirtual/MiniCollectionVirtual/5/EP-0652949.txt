 DescriptionNon-Native Liver Generation in anAnimal With Impaired Native Liver Function, by Cell ImplantationTechnical FieldThe invention relates to non-native functioning liver generation in animals with impaired native liver function, and to (transgenic) animals harboring functioning non-native livers.Background ArtThere is a current notable shortage of donor livers. In 1990, illustratively, 2, 656 liver transplants were performed, but 10 times more people died of liver disease. The treatment of liver disease by the implantation of healthy liver cells has long been envisioned as a potential solution to liver diseases. Hepatocyte transplantation could be used to treat patients with congenital hepatic enzyme deficiencies to replace liver lost through disease (e.g. viral hepatitis, alcohol-related cirrhosis or fibrosis) , or provide a temporary support system where acute liver dysfunction may be resolved by regeneration over a period of time. Hepatocyte transplantation also offers the opportunity to create animal models with human liver function. Such animals would be very useful for the study of viral infections affecting the liver (e.g. human hepatitis virus or cytomegalovirus infection) and/or test the effectiveness and safety of treatment or therapies for such infections. They would also be useful for the study of chemical (e.g. alcohol) toxicity in the human liver and chemical-induced cirrhosis and fibrosis and to test the effectiveness and safety of treatments or therapies for chemical-induced liver damage.Historically, several methods have been pursued in an attempt to create an auxiliary liver. Transplantation of liver fragments had been carried out as early as the 1930s. However, in most cases the transplanted liver tissue either degenerated 

or disappeared within a few days or weeks.Greater success in hepatocyte transplants have been observed through the development of methods for isolating viable hepatocytes. Among these methods, the "digestion-perfusion" method of Barry and Friend (J. Cell Biol . , (1969) 41:506-520) , block perfusion (Rees and Byard, In Vitro, (1981) 17:935-941) , and injection-digestion (Woods et al, Transplantation, (1982) 3_3_:123-126) have produced good yields of viable mature hepatocytes for injection. For a review see Gupta et al, HepatoloÏƒv. (1992) 15:156-162.In addition to problems in hepatocyte isolation, the method and site of implantation have been investigated for their effect on transplantation.
