<ABSTRACT>
A transmitting and receiving module for bidirectional optical data and signal transmission with an optical transmitter (1), an optical receiver (2), a fibre connection (4) for a common optical fibre (6), an optical lens coupling system (7, 9, 10) and an intermediate beam splitter (3) disposed in the free beam path (11), arranged in a common housing (5), is intended to enable bidirectional optical multichannel transmission. At least one further optical transmitter (1) and/or optical receiver (2) with an associated optical lens coupling system (7) and at least one further beam splitter (3) are provided in the common housing (5). Field of application: Multichannel transceiver module.
