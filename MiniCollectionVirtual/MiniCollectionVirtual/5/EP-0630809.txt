Filling device for packagings brought individually into 
a shaping chamber, more particularly for paper bags or paper 

sacks, with a filling pipe which projects into the 
packaging, and a shaking device (8) which causes compacting 

of the filling material, characterised in that the shaping 
chamber consists of two opposing side walls (6,7), that the 

base of the shaping chamber mounted separately from the two 
side walls (6,7) is designed as a shaking base (8), that the 

filling pipe for shaping the paper bag or paper sack when 
projecting into the shaping chamber is designed to move to 

the inside of the base of the paper sack or paper bag (5) 
and to press this base against the shaking base (8) so that 

the shaking base causes pre-compacting of the filling 
material in the filling pipe. 
Filling device according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the shaking base (8) has on its upper side adjoining 

the base of the packaging on the outside an elastic bearing 
surface. 
Filling device according to one of claims 1 or 2 
characterised in that the filling pipe (1) has expanding 

members (10) on its downwardly opening mouth. 
Filling device according to one or more of claims 1 to 
3 characterised in that the filling pipe (1) has a 

rectangular cube shape. 
Filling device according to one or more of claims 1 to 
4 characterised in that the precompacting of the filling  

 
material inside the filling pipe (1) is assisted through a 

vacuum by means of a suction pipe (4).
