<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to folding tables, and in
particular, to a mechanism which locks the table in its
unfolded position and retains the leg in its folded
position.Folding tables are well known in the art. They
commonly are used in homes, offices, training rooms,
cafeterias, etc. when extra table space is needed. When
not needed, the tables are folded up and stored in some
unobtrusive manner.To prevent the table from collapsing during use,
folding tables commonly include some mechanism for locking
the table legs in their unfolded position. Some of these
locking mechanisms do not securely lock the legs open and
may be prone to folding during use. See for example
GB-A-2,049,025. Some designs may also lead
to accidental finger pinches while unlocking the
mechanism. Again, reference may be made to the just
mentioned British patent, as well as
US-A-4,561,622. Other mechanisms available in the
prior art, while suitable for their intended purposes, are
complicated in construction or expensive in their
manufacture, or both.To prevent the legs from accidentally unfolding
during transportation of the table or while the table is
stored, it is also desirable to hold the legs in their
closed, folded position. A foldable table as defined in the
precharacterizing portion of independent claim 1 is
disclosed in US-A-1,956,946. This state of the art folding
table has strut means pivotally connected at one end to leg
means of the table and slidable at the other end in a
bracket means secured to the table bottom surface. First
spring means are mounted on the strut means and connected
to pin means for locking the leg means to the table top in
the folded position of the leg means. Second spring means
are mounted on the strut means and connected to pin means
for locking the strut means to said bracket means in the
folded and the unfolded position of the leg means.Reference is also made to US-A-1,571,807 in which
strut means pivotally connected to table leg means are
connected to slide blocks movably mounted in slide bars.
The slide blocks have latching devices for locking the
slide blocks to the slide bars in the folded and unfolded
position of the leg means. A similar foldable table is also
disclosed in DE-B-1 076 920.One of the objects of this invention is to provide
a foldable table wherein the legs can be held in their
folded position and locked in their unfolded position. Another object is to provide such a table having an
operational mechanism which is sturdy in use.Another object is to provide a locking mechanism

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A foldable table including:

a table top (3);
leg means (9) pivotally connected to a bottom
surface (5) of said table top (3) to be moved between an

open unfolded position and a closed folded position;
strut means (31) pivotally connected at one end to
said leg means (9) and having a head (37) at another end

thereof;
bracket means (83) secured to said table bottom
surface (5) defining an elongate channel (93), said strut

head (37) being slidably received in said channel (93);
means for locking said leg means (9) in said
unfolded position;
means for unlocking said leg means (9) from said
unfolded position; and
means for holding said leg means (9) in said folded
position,

   characterized in that said means for holding said
leg means (9) in said folded position are clip means for

snappingly engaging said leg means (9), said clip means
forming said means for unlocking said leg means (9) from

said unfolded position.
The table of claim 1, characterized in that said
bracket means (83) includes a side wall (89) having an

opening (95) at an end thereof proximate the pivotal
connection of said leg means (9) to said table top (3),

said means for locking said leg means (9) in said unfolded
position comprising pin means (65) on said strut head (37),

said pin means (65) being received in said side wall
opening (95).
The table of claim 2, characterized in that said
pin means (65) is biased outwardly.
The table of claim 3, characterized in that said
means for unlocking said leg means (9) from said unfolded

position includes grip means (59R, 59C) connected to said
pin means (65) to pull said pin means (69) inwardly and out

of said side wall opening (95). 
The table of claim 4, characterized by said grip
means (59R, 59C) defining said clip means which snappingly

receive said leg means (9) to lock said leg means (9) in
said folded position.
The table of claim 5, characterized in that said
strut means (31) includes a left half (31L) and a right

half (31R), each said half having one of said grip means
(59C, 59R) slidably secured to its respective strut head

(37), each said grip means (59C, 59R) having an inner
curved surface (69), said clip means comprising said strut

left half grip means (59C) and said strut right half-grip
means (59R).
The table of claim 1, characterized in that said
strut (31) biases said clip means against said leg means

(9) when said leg means (9) is in said folded position.
