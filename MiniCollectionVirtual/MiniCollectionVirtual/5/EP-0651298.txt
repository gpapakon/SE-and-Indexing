<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming 
apparatus of electrophotographic or electrostatic 
recording type, and, more particularly to a color image 
forming apparatus in which a recording material is 
supported on a recording material supporting member 
and visible images of plural colors, formed on an image 
bearing member, are transferred in superposed manner 
onto a same recording material. Also the present 
invention relates to an oil cleaning member adapted 
to be mounted on an image forming apparatus such as 
a copying machine or a laser beam printer. In the following there will be explained, with 
reference to Fig. 14, a color image forming apparatus 
for forming a full color image. In this example of the color image forming 
apparatus, a photosensitive drum (image bearing member) 
1 is supported so as to be rotatable in a direction 
indicated by an arrow, and a corona charger 2, an optical 
system 3, a developing unit 4, a transfer unit 5 and 
a cleaning unit 6 are provided around the photosensitive 
drum 1. The optical system 3 is comprised of an original 
scanning unit and color separation filters, and  
 
comprised for, for example, of a laser beam exposure 
unit for irradiating the photosensitive drum 1 with 
a color separated optical image or an equivalent optical 
image E. The photosensitive drum 1, uniformly charged 
by the charger 2, is irradiated with the optical image 
E, for each separated color, to form an electrostatic 
latent image. The developing unit 4 of the fixed type 
is comprised of four developing units, namely a yellow 
developing unit 4y, a cyan developing unit 4c, a magenta 
developing unit 4m and a black developing unit 4bk, 
positioned along the periphery of the photosensitive 
drum 1. The latent image on the photosensitive drum 
1 is developed by said developing unit, whereby a 
visible image is formed on said drum 1 with toner 
principally composed of resin. The toner image on the photosensitive drum 
1 is transferred onto a recording material, which is 
supplied from a recording material cassette 7, through 
a transport system and a transfer unit 5 (along a 
broken-lined sheet path), to a position opposed to 
the photosensitive drum 1. The transfer unit 5 of 
this example is provided with a transfer drum 5a, a 
transfer corona charger 5b, an attraction corona charger 
5c for electrostatic attraction of the recording 
material, an attraction roller 5g opposed thereto, 
an internal corona charger 5d and an external corona  
 
charger 5e, and a recording
