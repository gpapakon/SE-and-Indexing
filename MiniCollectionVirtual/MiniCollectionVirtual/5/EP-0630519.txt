A Dynamic Color Separation (DCS) color display system employs signals which provide timing, luminance, and chrominance information of the display output. The display system includes a timing circuit which produces unique signals for correcting errors produced when hue is controlled by the phase of the (S) signal and the degree of saturation with its amplitude. The signals may be applied to known CRT beam guns, and modified guns specific to the generated signals are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the electrically controlled
generation or reproduction of color displays based on a
composite video input signal providing information as to the
timing or synchronization, the luminance or brightness content,
and the chrominance or color content of the display output.
The invention relates in particular to a dynamic color separation
color display system according to the preamble of claim 1.
The technique employed is that of dynamic color separation wherein
an energy beam is directed in a repeated and prescribed sequence
over the format of the display screen area only to those colors
required to be produced, thereby providing a high efficiency
display.The invention will be described in relation to the video
content of the NTSC TV signal. However, NTSC transmission
includes gamma (Î³) correction for typical CRT beam drive non-linearity.
This feature is not pertinent to some color
separation methods and it is to be understood that gamma
correction will not apply herein except where shown. NTSC is
well known and there are numerous methods by which the signal
may be separated into three fundamental components of timing,
brightness and chrominance (C). Chrominance may be further
divided into its dominant hue (H) and degree of saturation (S),
which are the two components by which the eye recognizes color
content of a scene. The method of generation of the display,
however, relies on the provision of three primary colors, red
(R), green (G) and blue (B), which have become the universal
standard for providing a full range of color content.Several methods of color display are known in the art.
These include the well known shadow mask and CRT's employing
beam penetration phosphors. A third system uses a separate CRT
for generation of each color and the three components must be 
mechanically and optically superimposed exactly to register the
three outputs to provide a single full color display. These
methods each have distinct disadvantages with respect to
parameters such as bulk, complexity, and cost and performance
characteristics such as luminous output efficiency, resolution,
and display accuracy.Another type of system, most of which were unsuccessful and
eventually abandoned, are known as indexing systems. These
systems failed, generally, because of technical requirements,
the importance of which were not recognized, or because the art
was not sufficiently advanced to meet the systems' needs.A large majority of these indexing systems rely on a
technique known as sequential color
