<ABSTRACT>
A three component refrigerant composition for use in 
vapour compression refrigerators and avoiding the use of 

ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons comprises a three 
component mixture of: 


(i) a major portion comprised of 
chlorodifluoromethane (R22) or 

pentafluoroethane (R125); 
(ii) R125 or octafluoropropane (R218); and 
(iii) propane 
 
in non-flammable proportions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a three-component 
refrigerant mixture for use in refrigeration apparatus 
which has improved environmental acceptability. In refrigeration apparatus, two commonly used 
refrigerants have been the chlorofluorocarbon gases (CFC) 
referred to as refrigerant 12 (CCl₂F₂) and refrigerant 502 
(an azeotrope of R115 (CClF₂CF₃) and R22 (CHClF₂)). 
However, refrigerants 12 and 502 have been implicated in 
causing environmental damage. Specifically, these gases, 
which are very inert, are released from refrigeration 
systems, aerosols, foam packaging etc. at ground level and 
diffuse into the upper atmosphere. Because of their 
inertness, the gases are able to survive without 
decomposition until they reach the stratosphere where they 
are broken down by ultra-violet radiation, releasing 
chlorine atoms which catalyse breakdown of the 
stratospheric ozone layer. There has recently been 
considerable concern about reductions in stratospheric 
ozone levels and this has led to proposed bans on certain 
CFC'S such as refrigerants 11 and 12. Other refrigerants 
such as refrigerant 22 (CHClF₂) and refrigerant 125 
(CHF₂CF₃) are environmentally less objectionable as they 
tend to be naturally degraded at lower levels of the 
atmosphere before reaching the ozone layer. Considerable efforts are being made to replace  
 
refrigerants 12 and 502 with more environmentally 
acceptable alternatives. However, such new chemicals are 
generally unavailable at present and are expected to be 
considerably more expensive than presently used 
refrigerants. Whilst refrigerant 22 is environmentally more 
acceptable, it has a higher index of compression than, for 
example, refrigerant 12. This means that compressor 
discharge temperatures become excessive at pressure ratios 
which would not cause excessive discharge temperatures if 
refrigerant 12 were being used. Refrigerant R125 (CHF₂CF₃) has no ozone depleting 
potential. However, it is only now becoming commercially 
available and is very expensive to use alone. Propane (R290) has certain useful thermodynamic 
properties and its use as a refrigerant has been 
proposed. US Patent Specification 2511993 discloses the 
use of an azeotropic mixture of propane (32% by weight) 
and R22 as a refrigerant. However, propane by itself or 
in azeotropic mixtures has the significant disadvantage of 
forming inflammable mixtures with air, which poses a 
safety hazard in the event of leakage of refrigerant. Japanese Patent Specification 63-105088 discloses 
mixtures
