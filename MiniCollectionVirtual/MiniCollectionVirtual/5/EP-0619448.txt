<ABSTRACT>
A totally split mechanical face seal being installable 
and replaceable without necessitating breakdown of the 

shaft and/or housing. The inventive split seal is well 
suited for replacement of packing or stuffing in heavy 

duty or inaccessible locations. The inventive seals 
include a sealing element (112) that seals the primary 

ring (106) against the shaft (16) and rigidly positions 
the primary ring (106) in the axial, circumferential and 

radial directions, and also includes a sealing element 
(740 which seals the mating ring (84) against the housing 

(24) and non-rigidly positions the mating ring (84) in 
the axial direction while simultaneously providing an 

axial biasing force on the mating ring to provide mating 
contact of the two rings (84, 106). For applications 

where gross displacements of the shaft (16) relative to 
the housing (24) are expected, a thrust bearing or a 

connection (278, 256, 240, 242, 244) is made between the 
mating ring assembly (80) and rotating elements 

associated with the shaft (16). Alternatively, a bearing 
assembly (342) is provided for maintaining the axial 

position of the primary ring assembly (104) and both 
primary and mating rings (106, 84) are held in 

approximately the same positions relative to each other 
regardless of the gross shaft displacements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of co-pending application 
Serial No 07/805,470 filed on December 10, 1991, which is 
a continuation of application Serial No 07/529,208 filed 
on May 25, 1990, now US Patent No 5,114,163. The related patent, US Patent No 5,114,163, of which this 
is a continuation-in-part, includes an embodiment 
illustrated in Fig. 8 for applications in which the 
shafts of the operating devices, such as pumps or 
turbines, are subject to greater axial shifts than those 
which would normally be expected. The design of that 
embodiment utilises a thrust bearing to move a 
rotationally stationary split holder in conjunction with 
the axial movement of the shaft. That portion of the 
specification relating to the embodiment of Fig. 8 and 
other relevant portions of US Patent No 5,114,163 are 
incorporated by reference herein where appropriate. The Fig. 8 embodiment referenced in parent US Patent No 
5,114,163 by and large is able to withstand axial 
displacements of small proportions, on the order of 1/2 
to 1 inch. However, any axial displacements greater than 
these would be hampered by the obstruction of the housing 
against the split holder member, which has only a limited 
degree of freedom in the axial direction before the seal 
formed by the O-ring disposed between the split holder 
member and the housing fails. Alternatively, the 
radially extending shoulder portion of the split holder 
will impinge on the radially extending wall of the 
housing. Thus, what is necessary is a split mechanical face seal 
which can withstand much greater proportional axial 
displacements, up to 6 inches, without sacrificing the 
sealing characteristics of the split seal elements.  Accordingly, what is disclosed herein is a split 
mechanical face seal for providing fluid-tight sealing 
between a housing and a shaft adapted to rotate relative 
thereto comprising adjacent, rigid, annular, primary and 
mating rings formed of a plurality of arcuate ring 
segments, each defining generally radial, opposed sealing 
faces, means for joining and retaining the ring segments 
of each of the rings in rigid connection with the other 
segments of each ring, whereby each opposed sealing face 
defined by the rings has a smooth surface devoid of 
discontinuities around its complete circumference, the 
joining and retaining means further comprising a 
resilient split means for the primary ring and a 
resilient split means for the mating ring, each resilient 
split means positioning and supporting its associated 
ring in
