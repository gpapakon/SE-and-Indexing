<ABSTRACT>
The present specification describes a method for manufacturing a motor-vehicle window pane (glazing) (1) provided with a polymer frame (52) installed on the edge of the pane (1). The frame (52) is extruded onto the pane (1), which is immobilized at the work station of a handling robot using a support device appropriate to the shape of the pane (1) in such a way that the edge of the pane overhangs beyond the bearing surface (4, 5) of the support device. Using the handling robot, an extrusion die (40) gripping the edge of the pane and provided with a U-shaped recess (41) over its entire length is driven along the edge of the pane. At the front end of the two jaws of the U-shaped die (41) are arranged sealing strips (42, 43) which can move perpendicularly to the surfaces of the pane and which, during extrusion, bear on the surfaces of the pane.

Process for the production of a glazing with a polymer frame, put into
place by moulding and which encloses the glazing on at least two sides

(22, 23), having the following stages:

a) the glazing (1) is supplied to the work station where it is kept stationary
with the aid of a support device (3), its edge projecting freely beyond the

bearing surfaces of the support (3),
b) an extrusion die (25) is moved towards the edge of the glazing (1),
the latter having a notch (26) with a U-shaped cross-section and in

which engages the edge of the glazing,
c) against at least one surface (22) of the glazing is pressed a mobile ledge
(31), whose wall (30) limits the opening of the U of the die, the rear

wall of the latter having the gauged orifice, which determines the cross-section
of the extruded polymer bead,
d) after initiating the flow of polymer, the die is moved making it follow
the edge of the glazing (1),
e) during the extrusion Operation, the mobile ledge (31) is brought into
its final, spaced apart position and the die into its rest position close to

the glazing.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that when a single mobile
ledge (31) equips the extrusion die (25), the jaw (27) of the U-shaped

notch (26) has, during stages c) and d), its surface (28) in contact
with the glazing surface (21).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that when two mobile
ledges (42, 43) equip the extrusion die (40), they are pressed onto the two

surfaces (21, 22) of the glazing during stages c) and d) of the process and
are in their final, open position during stages b) and e) of the process.
Device for performing the process according to one of the claims 1 to 3,
having a handling robot (9), a support and displacement system (3, 4, 5, 6)

maintaining the glazing (1) in the operative position, a mechanism (15, 16)
supplying the polymer to be extruded, an extrusion die (11, 25, 40, 55)

enclosing the edge of the glazing (1), is provided over its entire length
with a U-shaped notch (26, 41), with a gauged die orifice made in its

rear face, seen in the die displacement direction, characterized in that at 
least one of the two jaws of the U-shaped notch of the die is provided,

at its front end, with a sealing ledge (31) movable perpendicular to the
corresponding, main surface of the glazing and which, in the operative

position of the die, bears on the glazing surface.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the extrusion die
(25), has on one side of the U-shaped notch (26) over the entire die

length, a mobile sealing ledge (31) and, on the other side of the U-shaped
notch (26), a planar sliding surface (28) for sliding contact with the

main surface (21) of the glazing.
Device according to one of the claims 4 or 5, characterized in that the
surfaces of the extrusion die (25, 40) sliding, during the extrusion operation,

on the glazing (1), are provided with an elastic covering (35, 36)
having good sliding properties on the glass surface.
Device according to one of the claims 4 to 6, characterized in that the
extrusion die (55) has two ducts (57, 58), each of which supplies a different

part of the cross-section of the orifice (56) of the die by means of the
polymer to be extruded, the volume flow rates of the polymer to be extruded

being regulatable independently of one another in said ducts.
Device according to one of the claims 4 to 7, characterized in that the
extrusion head carrying the extrusion die (55) is installed so as to be

mobile in the direction perpendicular to the glazing (1) and is provided
with a bearing roller (62), which bears on the glazing (1) in order to

compensate shape tolerances of said glazing (1).
