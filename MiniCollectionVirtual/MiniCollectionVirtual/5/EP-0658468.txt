<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic power Steering system includes a pump (100), a flow 
control valve (108), and a bypass control valve (120). The flow control 

valve (108) responds to a pressure drop across a metering orifice (105) 
disposed in a fluid supply passage (104) so as to control the flow 

rate of operating fluid by bypassing part of the operating fluid 
to a reservoir (101). A spring chamber (110) of the flow control valve 

(108) is 
connected to the supply passage (104) through a control orifice (109). The 

bypass control valve (120) is disposed between the spring chamber (110) 
and 

the reservoir (101) so as to increase the amount of bypassed fluid by 
controlling the pressure in the spring chamber (110). The bypass 

control valve (120) has a control spool (121), a load pressure 
introduction 

port (123A) connected to the upstream side of the control orifice 
(109) for 

leading the load pressure to a first end of the control spool (121) 
and a pilot port (123B) connected to the downstream side of the control 

orifice (109) for leading the pressure in the spring chamber (110) of the 
flow control valve (108) to a second end of the control spool (121). 

Moreover, a pressure receiving area of the second end of the 
control spool (121) is smaller than that of the first end of the 

control spool (121). Accordingly, a spring (122) having a small spring 
constant can be used in the bypass control valve (120), even when the 

control spool (121) is controlled within a short stroke. Further, the 
control spool (121), the load pressure introduction port (123
A), and the 
pilot port (123B) are formed in a sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic power steering
apparatus suitable for use in vehicles and the like. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a hydraulic power
steering apparatus which is capable of reducing the power
consumption of a vehicle engine by decreasing the flow rate
supplied from a pump to a control valve at a low load pressure.
Further, the present invention relates to an improvement in a
hydraulic power steering apparatus described in the co-pending
application EP-A-0 642 970 of the same assignee as
this application and another assignee. Said application, published
on 15.03.95, is a prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC.A hydraulic power steering apparatus is usually provided
with a hydraulic pump and a flow control valve for supplying a
pressurized fluid to an assist force generating mechanism at a
constant flow rate. In such power steering system, the energy
consumed by the hydraulic pump increases in accordance with an
increase in the flaw rate of the pressurized fluid. Therefore, 
the conventional hydraulic pump has a problem to always consume
a large energy or power.In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, improved
power steering apparatus have been proposed for reducing the
flow rate of pressurized fluid during high speed traveling.
Examples of such power steering apparatus are shown in Japanese
Patent Publication No. 54-5571 and U.S. Patent No. 4,714, 413.
For example, in the apparatus of Japanese Patent Publication No.
54-5571, there is provided a vehicle speed sensor S, an
amplifier A for amplifying a signal from the sensor S, and an
electromagnetic valve SV which responses to the amplified speed
signal, as shown in FIG. 1. The valve SV operates to reduce the
pressure in a spring chamber of a flow control valve FC in
accordance with an increase of the vehicle speed, whereby
reducing the flow rate of the pressurized fluid supplied to the
assist force generating mechanism which is composed of a rotary
valve RV and a power cylinder PC. This system reduces the
energy consumption of the hydraulic pump P. The power steering
system also has a preferable characteristic that assist forces
generated during high speed traveling are smaller than those
during low speed traveling.The conventional power steering apparatus, however, have
the following drawback. Namely, when the steering wheel HD is
turned, the flow rate of the fluid flowing through the
electromagnetic valve SV increases compared with that when the
steering wheel HD remains at its neutral position,
