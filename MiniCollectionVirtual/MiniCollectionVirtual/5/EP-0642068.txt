<ABSTRACT>
Generic type of the invention: pilot-controlled hydraulic valve for changing over the valve input pressure (p1) between a working pressure value and a lower circulating pressure value, in particular a pressure limiting valve. A main flow path is provided here with inlet (16) and outlet (17), a main valve (HV) arranged in the main flow path and a pilot control valve (VV1) operatively connected to the main valve. The main valve (HV) is provided with a resiliently elastic reset element (6). Object of the invention: production of a valve of the abovementioned type which is distinguished by a low circulating pressure with nonetheless high operational reliability, even for relatively high working pressures and relatively large flows. Achieving the object: in conjunction with the features of the generic type, provision is made of a relieving device (EV) which can be activated by the pilot control valve (VV1), is operatively connected to the reset element (6) and controls the resetting effect on the main valve (HV). Furthermore, the relieving device (EV) is designed such that it can be changed over, under the effect of the pilot control valve (VV1), between an activated position with a reduced effect of the reset element (6) on the main valve (HV) and a deactivated position with increased effect of the reset element on the main valve.

by a feed flow from the valve intake (16) via a throttle
(7) into said control pressure chamber (18), and on the

other side by a discharge flow from said control pressure

condition of the pilot valve (VV1, VV2).

to anyone of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the pilot valve (VV1) is capable of being switched over

position, assigned to the circulation-pressure condition

assigned to the operation-pressure condition with the

relief device being deactivated. 
A hydraulic valve according to the claims 3 and 9,
characterized by the following features:


a) the main valve resetting member (6), preferably

the main valve member (5) and the control piston (8);

force, holds the control piston (8) in a position

bias tension.

pressure limiting valve, according to anyone of claims 1

to 8, characterized by the following features:

(8) in a position (U) displaced towards the main
valve member (5) with a correspondingly high closing

bias tension of the main valve (HV).
