<ABSTRACT>
The laminated composite product comprises at least two solid bodies, which may or may not be flexible and may or may not be identical, joined together by a tie layer made of a water-soluble film-forming material exhibiting good adhesion to the respective surfaces of the said solid bodies. Several layers or additional bodies are added to one or other of the bodies mentioned. Typical application: printed and lacquered labels which are easy to remove (unstick) in an aqueous medium, and sheets of packaging.
