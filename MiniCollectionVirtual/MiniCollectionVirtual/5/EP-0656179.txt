<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the field of 
pasteurization of cubed food products, such as 

fruit or tomato, and in particular discloses a 
process and device for controlling flow rate of a 

drainage phase of liquid separating from food 
chunks, which phase takes place after 

pasteurization and before stroing of the product 
in sterile bags. A sterile gas such as nitrogen 

is introduced into a tank (7) containing liquid 
removed from the food cubes, and a ratio of 

difference in pressure between the gas and a 
pressure in a discharge conduit of the food 

product is continually controlled. When changes in 
ratio between the pressure differences occur, gas 

is introduced into the tank (7) or discharged 
therefrom, as appropriate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for
controlling drainage rate in a drainage device for
separating liquid from a cubed food product and to a drainage
device.The food conservation industry includes the
production of worked or semiworked food pieces,
consisting in pieces of food of desired
dimensions, generally called chunks. This
production is very commonly used in all fruit
processing as well as tomatoes.After cubing the food proceeds to sterilization
and thereafter to storage, undergoing the latter
two processes mixed with a liquid, consisting of
the juice of the product itself produced during
cubing, together with other sterile liquids.This liquid mixture enables transport of the
chunks to be effected without having to resort to
using high-pressures which might damage them, and
furthermore guarantees sterility during transport
along a sterilization plant where the product is 
subjected to heating and cooling phases before
being stored in bags or barrels by means of
filling machines, also operating under conditions
of absolute sterility.Before the filling operation can begin, however,
the chunks have to be separated from the liquid
mixture, and this is performed using drainage
devices essentially comprising two concentric
cylinders.The internal cylinder is generally provided with
spaced bars forming a grill. The chunks and liquid
are introduced therein and the liquid drains down
into the external cylinder, whereupon it is
removed by an extraction pump, while the chunks
are removed from the internal cylinder by a pump
which also regulates the outflow rate thereof.With known-type drainage devices as illustrated in EP-A-0362975 it is difficult
to obtain a regular drainage rate which keeps a
very low and constant quantity of residual liquid
while maintaining a constant outflow rate of the
drained chunks.Constant drainage regulation depends principally
on the difference in pressure existing in the
outflow conduit for the chunks and in the liquid
collection cylinder. This pressure difference can 
vary for various reasons, such as a partially
blocked grill, or to an increase or decrease in
the chunk-liquid ratio.Up to now, in order to keep the pressure as
constant as possible, it has only been possible to
act directly on the two pumps, which creates
obvious difficulties in regulation as well as
unpredictable response to such regulation.The main aim of the present invention is to
obviate the above-described drawbacks, and in
particular to render the above-mentioned pressure
differences constant by means of

<CLAIMS>
A process for controlling drainage rate in a
drainage device for separating liquid from a cubed

food product, said drainage device comprising:

two concentric cylinders (2 and 3) whereof an
internal cylinder (3) comprises spaced bars

constituting a grill wherethrough the liquid falls
and separates from the cubes; said liquid being

collected in a chamber between the two
cylinders (2 and 3), said internal cylinder (3)

being connected with an inlet conduit (5) of a
cube/liquid mixture to be separated as well as

with an outlet conduit (6) of the cubes after a
separation has taken place, 
characterised in that

said process comprises the following phases:

introducing of a sterile and inert gas into a tank (7)
communicating with the collection chamber of the

liquid, which tank (7) collects liquid up to a
predetermined level which remains constant during the drainage

phase;
reading of the pressure of the sterile and inert gas in
the tank (7);
reading of the pressure in the outlet conduit 
(6) of the cubes after separation thereof from the

liquid;
calculating of a difference between the pressure
of the sterile and inert gas in the tank (7) and the

pressure in the outlet conduit (6) and comparison
of a result thereof with a predetermined set

value;
introducing or discharging of the sterile and inert gas
into or out of the tank (7) wherever said

calculation of a difference results in a value
which is not null or not within an acceptable

range of values, in order to keep the pressure difference within
the device as constant as possible.
A process as in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 in
the first phase of introduction of a sterile and inert gas,

two concentric cylinders (3 and 2) whereof an
internal cylinder (3) is formed by spaced bars

constituting a grill wherethrough the liquid is able to fall
and separate from the cubes; said liquid being 

collectable in a chamber between the two

a second pressure gauge (18) placed on the outlet
conduit (6) of the cubes after the separation

thereof from the liquid, for reading a pressure in
the outlet conduit (6);
a data processor for reading a difference in
pressures measured by the first and second

pressure gauges (19 and 18), and for comparing
such difference to a preset acceptable range of

values;
two solenoid valves (15 and 16) inserted
