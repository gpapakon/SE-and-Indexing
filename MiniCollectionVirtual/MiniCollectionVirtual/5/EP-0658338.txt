<ABSTRACT>
A curly hair-straightening composition is disclosed, 
which comprises: (A) from 1 to 20 % by weight of one or more 

keratin-reducing substances selected from the group 
consisting of thioglycolic acid, thioglycolic acid 

derivatives, cysteine, N-acylcysteines, salts thereof, 
thioglyceryl alkyl ethers, mercaptoalkylamides, sulfites and 

hydrogensulfites; (B) one or more alcohols selected from the 
group consisting of monohydric alcohols having a straight-chain 

or branched alkyl group carrying 3 or 4 carbon atoms 
and dihydric or trihydric alcohols having a straight-chain or 

branched alkyl group having 4 to 6 carbon atoms; and (C) 

water; wherein the weight ratio of the component (B) to the 
component (C) is from 1:3 to 3:1. Further, a method for 

straightening curly hair by using this composition is also 
disclosed. The curly hair-straightening composition of the 

present invention can permanently and sufficiently straighten 
natural curly hair or frizzy hair without causing any damage 

on the hair.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the straightening of curly hair
whereby natural curly hair or frizzy hair can be
straightened and made easy to style.Natural curly hair or frizzy hair frequently causes
many hair styling problems. For example, the hair tends to
spread uncontrollably, hair tips curl up and/or it is
difficult to be arranged tidily. A number of methods have
been proposed for curing these problems of curly or frizzy
hair. A typical cure is the so-called permanent
straightening treatment, a chemical treatment which comprises
fully cleaving disulfide bonds in hair keratin through a
chemical reduction process and stretching the hair by
adhering it to a panel or combing it. The straightened hair
is then oxidized and fixed to restore the disulfide bonds in
the hair, thereby permanently straightening the hair.Hair which has been artificially permanently waved
can be sufficiently straightened by this method. However,
natural curly hair or frizzy hair can hardly be straightened
by this method, or even when it has once straightened by this
method, it returns to its original curly state within several
days. To solve this problem, JP-A-60-21704 (the term "JP-A"
as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent 
application") proposes a method which comprises heating the
reduced hair with an iron in addition to the conventional
permanent straightening treatment, to enhance the efficiency
of deformation of the hair through thermal denaturation and
further reduction. JP-A-59-90508 proposes another method
which comprises reducing the hair, steaming the reduced hair
and then reducing the resulting hair again with the first
pack of reducing agent in the form of a gel. A severe
treatment aiming at achieving improved straightening effects
would seriously damage the hair. Thus, attempts have been
made to improve straightening effect with less damage by
using sulfites of a weak reducing capability, or substances
similar thereto, by lowering the pH value of the first
reducing pack, or by using a specific activator or an oily
material in combination.DE 3535351 discloses a hair straightening composition
in which a solvent (such as N-methyl-pyrrolidone) and a
reducing agent are used in combination.
DE-A-19 55 823 describes reducing hair and skin
damage by a two stage straightening process involving
sequential treatments with keratin softening agents and alcohols. Further, U.S. Patent
4,963,349 and EP 363057 disclose an aqueous permanent waving
lotion containing a 1,3-alkaneldiol including a

<CLAIMS>
Use of a composition comprising the following components
(A), (B) and (C):


(A) from 1 to 20% by weight of one or more keratin-reducing
substances selected from the group

consisting of thioglycolic acid, thioglycolic acid
derivatives, cysteine, N-acylcysteines, salts

thereof, thioglyceryl alkyl ethers, mercaptoalkyl
amides, sulfites and hydrogensulfites;
(B) one or more alcohols selected from the group
consisting of monohydric alcohols having a

straight-chain or branched alkyl group having 3 or
4 carbon atoms and dihydric or trihydric alcohols

having a straight-chain or branched alkyl group
having 4 to 6 carbon atoms; and
(C) water;

wherein the weight ratio of the component (B) to the
component (C) ranges from 1:3 to 3:1;

for straightening curly hair.
The use as claimed in claim 1, wherein component (B) is
one or more substances selected from the group consisting of

2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,2-pentanediol,
1-propanol and 2-propanol.
A method for straightening curly hair which comprises
applying to the hair an appropriate amount of a composition

as set forth in claim 1 or claim 2, allowing it to stand over
a period of time sufficient for straightening the curly hair

and then washing away with water.
