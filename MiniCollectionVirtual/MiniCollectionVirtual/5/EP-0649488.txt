<ABSTRACT>
Aseismic insulating devices for buildings and structures consisting of two block elements of a hard material respectively integral with the building's infrastructure and superstructure. One of said elements is formed from a horizontal friction plate (7) including at its centre a truncated cone (2), the other element having the shape of a circular cap with a flat bottom which covers said truncated cone by leaving an annular space in which is disposed at least one damping ring (3, 3') filling all or part of said space, simple or multiple elastic polymer layers (17, 18) being inserted horizontally in the thickness of the block elements. The insulating layers are designed to be inserted between the infrastructure and superstructure of buildings, enabling them to withstand the effects of seismic disturbances.
