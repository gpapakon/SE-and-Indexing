<ABSTRACT>
In a computed tomographic imaging method and 
apparatus a subject in an examination region (14) moves 

axially as an x-ray source (12) rotates therearound. 
Views corresponding to a spiral path around a volume of 

interest in the patient are sampled, interpolated (46), 
and reconstructed (54) into a three-dimensional image 

representation (56). This process is repeated a 
plurality of times to generate a plurality of three-dimensional 

image representations of the same volume at 
time displaced intervals. The plurality of image 

representations are temporally interpolated (120) to 
generate a series of image representations, each one of 

which represents the same time or time intervals, i.e., 
a four-dimensional image representation that is linear 

in all four dimensions. A contrast agent may be 
injected into the patient such that the data represents 

the movement of contrast agent through the volume of 
interest. A reference image representation (126) of 

the volume of interest with no contrast agent is 
subtracted (124) from the four-dimensional image 

representation to generate a four-dimensional image 
(128) of the movement of the contrast agent through the 

volume of interest.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to computed
tomographic (CT) imaging. It finds particular
application in conjunction with spiral volume imaging
with CT scanners for medical diagnostic purposes and
will be described with particular reference thereto.In spiral volume imaging with CT scanners for
medical diagnostic purposes, the x-ray source or tube
rotates continuously as the patient support table moves
at a constant, linear velocity. In this manner, the
collected data effectively represents a helical path of
constant pitch through the patient. Conventionally,
the data is stored and handled as a series of parallel
planes, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the
patient, or more specifically, as a three dimensional
rectangular matrix of 
memory cells. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 3,432,657
to Slavin.For some medical diagnoses, it is advantages to
inject a patient with a contrast agent, usually a high-Z
contrast material such as iodine. Depending on how far the
imaged region is from the heart, the contrast material
maintains its peak concentration level in the region of
interest over a period of about 30-90 seconds. CT scanning
techniques have been developed for generating images of the
region of interest while the contrast agent is near its
peak. For example, ultra fast CT, i.e. electron beam
scanning, has been used to cover a significant volume. See
"Power-Injected CT Contrast Opacifies Vascular Spaces", Sam
D. Lane, Diagnostic Imaging, November 1988. However, this
technique cannot show contrast variations over a
significant volume over a period of time. Lane must leave
the couch in one position in order to show contrast
variations of the same region over time. Thus, the Lane
technique is disadvantageous due to the increased dose of
contrast agent and the limiting of measurements to only a
single observed axial slice.A volume helical scanning technique is discussed
in U.S. Patent No. 4,789,929 of Nishimura, et al. which
utilizes back and forth motion of the couch to achieve more
complete sampling of the volume being scanned. Nishimura
does not address the concept in a temporal dimension.
Moreover, the back and forth movement during data
collection results in a temporally non-uniform sampling,
particularly for regions of interest near the ends of the
volume.A volume helical imaging technique and apparatus
addressing temporal interpolation of three dimensional
image representations is discussed in EP-A-587 334. This
document is part of the prior art according to Article 54(3) EPC. Spiral volume scans
