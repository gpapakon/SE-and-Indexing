<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of detecting an 
analyte in a liquid sample that utilizes the acoustic 
and light energy propagational properties of a polymer 
interfaced with a sensor. Detection mechanisms capable of detecting chemical 
and biological substances in the nanomolar range are 
finding increasing utility in a variety of commercial 
fields including the food, healthcare, environmental and 
waste treatment industries. A number of sensitive 
devices have been developed to meet these detection 
needs, including those taking advantage of shifts in 
resonant frequency such as piezoelectric transducers as 
well as optical sensors which operate on the basis of 
changes in refractive indices. The ability of piezoelectric transducers to detect 
small changes in mass, viscosity and density at their 
surfaces while immersed in liquids has made them 
particularly useful as analytical tools where the 
measurement of very small amounts of material must be 
made in solution. Design strategies for piezoelectric 
sensors have primarily involved events that result in 
mass changes at the surface of the crystal. The most 
extensively studied transducer in this regard has been 
the shear mode AT-cut quartz resonator, commonly 
referred to as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), 
which comprises an AT-cut quartz crystal sandwiched 
between two metal excitation electrodes. An example of 
the use of the QCM used to detect biological analytes is 
seen in EPO Patent Publication No. 0 215 669 (Karube et  
 
al.) where the concentration of an analyte in solution 
was calculated on the basis of the change in resonance 
frequency (Δf) caused by the weight of an analyte added 
to a receptor material immobilized on the surface of a 
piezoelectric device. The invention of Karube 
demonstrated that the piezoelectric transducer was 
useful in measuring the concentration of some biological 
analytes. Although a useful tool in solution environments, a 
piezoelectric transducer must have its surface modified 
in order to give it a measure of specificity for the 
analyte to be detected, and preparation of these 
modified piezoelectric devices is procedurally complex 
and often difficult. In cases where the analytes to be 
detected are biological in nature, receptor agents 
(antigens, antibodies or other ligands) must be 
immobilized on the surface of the crystal. This method 
has significant inherent limitations; however, as the 
receptor agents can inactivate during the immobilization 
process or separate from the surface
