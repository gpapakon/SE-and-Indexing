<ABSTRACT>
A saddle type pipe joint (21) for construction of 
branching connections, composed of a saddle-shaped main 

pipe-connecting part (23) and a cylindrical branching pipe-connecting 
part (25). The two parts are integrally molded by 

a reaction molding, composed of a shape-memorized plastic 
resin, and have on the inner surfaces a fusion-bonding 

plastic resin layer containing a conductive filler. The 
pipe joint is made by polymerising a reactive liquid stock 

for a shape-memorizable plastic resin in a mold using a 
core made of a fusible plastic resin containing a conductive 

filler; cutting the main pipe part of the molded composite 
article along its length at the side opposite to the 

branching pipe-connecting site; and opening side edges 
of the thus-cut main pipe. The construction of branching 

connections is carried out by utilizing the restoration 
of the shape-memorized plastic resin to the original shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pipe joint, a method 
of making the pipe joint, and a method of constructing 
a branching connection. More specifically, this invention 
relates to a saddle type plastic pipe joint used for 
connecting a branching plastic pipe to a main plastic pipe, 
a method of making the saddle type pipe joint and a method 
of connecting a branching plastic pipe to a main plastic 
pipe by utilizing a shape-memorizing function of the pipe 
joint. In recent years, plastic pipes such as polyolefin 
pipes, for example, a polyethylene pipe are often used 
in substitution for metal pipes as water lines, hot water 
supply pipes and hot spring-conducting pipes. Polyolefin 
pipes have advantages, compared with metal pipes, such 
that they are light in weight and easy to handle and have 
good corrosion resistance and chemical resistance, a scale 
is not readily deposited thereon, and they are of a large 
length and thus the number of joints can be decreased. In a pipe arrangement composed of plastic pipes, 
branching joints are indispensable for the construction 
of branching connections where pipes branch from midway 
locations of the length of a main pipe. As means for the 
construction of branching connections, a saddle type joint 
having embedded therein an electrically conductive wire 
as a heating element is used. The saddle type joint has 
a structure such that a circular opening is formed in the 
location of the main body where a branching pipe is  
 
connected to the main pipe, and the electrically conductive 
wire is wound in a spiral configuration around the opening. 
The saddle type joint has a saddle portion which covers 
approximately a half of the entire periphery of the main 
pipe (for example, see U.S. Patent No. 4,455,482 and 
4,894,521). The pipe joint of this type which has a 
spirally configured electrically conductive wire requires 
much labor to make the joint, and a special device or tool 
(for example, as illustrated in Fig. 12 of U.S. Patent 
No. 4,452,482) is necessary for fitting the saddle-shaped 
part of the joint to the main pipe. If the saddle-shaped 
part is fitted to the main pipe by welding without use 
of the special device or tool, where the main pipe has 
a distortion even though only to a minor extent, gaps are 
left between the inner surface of the pipe joint and the 
outer surface of the main pipe with the result that a good 
fusion-bonding cannot be obtained. A pipe joint having a heat-generating plastic element 
has also been proposed, which element has
