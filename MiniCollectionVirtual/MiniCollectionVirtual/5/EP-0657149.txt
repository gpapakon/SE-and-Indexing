<ABSTRACT>
Articulation for use on knee or hip of femoral 
ortheses, being formed by two articulated flat-bars, with 

90 degrees swing on the axle of articulation. The upper 
flat-bar (1) has a box (2) containing bolt (12) with a 

spiral spring (17). The lower flat-bar (8) has a yoke 
(10), held by a rivet (9). In the yoke is lodged the 

articulation axle (6) and a pin (11), supporting the bolt 
(12). The bolt is threaded (15) and there is a nut (16) 

to adjust the spiral spring force. On the other end of 
the bolt there is a semispherical washer (19), making end 

on the perforated wall (7) of the box (2). The perforated 
wall allows bolt (12) to pass through when articulation 

swings. The assembly mechanism is covered by two metallic 
lids (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to an articulation for 
use in knee or hip, whose purpose is to help walking, and 
both the seated and standing positions for these patients 
with one, or partially both lower extremities invalid 
caused by diseases such as poliomyelitis, 
myelomeningocele or any other neurologic defect such as 
brain paralysis and traumatic atrophys. It maintains the 
upright posture, and withstands hip and knee bending. 
Also it makes possible the extension of them when walking 
and raising up from sitting down posture. The invention is relevant to the industry involved 
in production of orthopaedic devices. Possibly, one of the oldest relics of orthopaedic 
devices was that discovered by the HEARST espedition to 
Egypt, where two sets of wooden splints bound to the 
fractures of 5.000 year old skeletons were found. HIPOCRATES AND GALENO tried to adjust deviation of 
the spiral column using ingenious devices; but it was 
AMBROSIO PARE who, in 1500, was the first to use metallic 
corsets wich were perforated to make them lighter and 
cushioned to avoid skin abrasions.  Medical terminology was enriched in 1741 when 
NICHOLAS ANDRY, Professor of Medicine at the University 
of Paris, gave the speciality of Orthopaedics its name. 
He built on all the efforts made from the ancient times, 
using mechanical aids that could improve some of the 
functional aspect of the human locomotor system. Initially Orthopaedics was defined as "the art to 
preventing and correcting deformities in the body of 
children", and used as therapy, basically, instruments 
placed in the area affected whose, purpose was to correct 
the deformity. They were orthopaedic apparatus or what we 
call nowadays ortheses and prostheses. Althogh Orthopaedics is considered as a speciality 
derived from Surgery, the surgical methods, that is, 
Orthopaedic surgery, were not used in the treatment of 
affections of the organs of mobility until nineteenth 
century by DELPECK, DUPINSTEN, STROMEYER, LITTLE, etc. The patients treated by the Othopaedic Services, for 
deficiencies or deformities of the body, specially the 
locomotor system, come from specialist areas such as 
Neurology, Neurosurgery, Paediatrics, Rheumatological 
Surgery or Internal Medicine. The two World Wars helped greatly to develop the 
field of Orthopaedics due to the great number of invalids 
produced. To over come the problem, Governements invested 
in research into ortheses and prostheses at Universities 
and Adaptation Centres. With the introduction of Biomechanic

<CLAIMS>
Dynamic articulations for use on knee or hip of 
femoral ortheses whose main charasteristic is that is 

formed by upper (1) and lower (8) flat-bars, joined by an 
axle (6), located on a yoke (10), restrained by a rivet 

(9) to the lower fla-bar; behind the axle, a bolt (11) 
joins both sides of the yoke (10); the lower part of the 

upper flat-bar (1) has a box (2), where is lodged the 
bolt (12), with cylindrical-shaped end, with a slot (14) 

in its distal face, coupled to the pin (11), thread (15) 
on the middle third portion, with hexagonal nut (16), and 

an extension on its upper end where the spiral spring 
(17) is restrained in contact with the semispherical 

washer (19) and that presses against a perforated wall 
(7) and a lid for internal and external coverage (20). 
Dynamic articulation, according to first claim, 
is essentially characterized by a yoke shaped part (10) 

situated on the upper part of the lower flat-bar. 
Dynamic articulation, according to former claims, 
is essentially characterized because behind the swing 

axle (6), the yoke (10) sides are joined by a bolt (11). 
Dynamic articulation, according to former claims, 
is essentially characterized by a bolt (12), positioned 

in the box of the upper flat-bar, with its lower end (14) 
with cylindrical shape and slot finished, followed by 

thread (15) and extension where an spiral spring (17) is 
restrained
. 
Dynamic articulation, according to former claims, 
is essentially characterized because the upper end of the 

spiral spring (17) is stopped with a semispherical washer 
(19). 
Dynamic articulation, according to former claims, 
is essentially characterized by a nut (16) threaded on a 

bolt (12), to adjust spiral spring (17) pressure. 
Dynamic articulation, according to former claims, 
ia essentially characterized because the box has a 

perforated wall (7), at the upper end, where the 
semispherical washer (19) is positioned to allow the bolt 

(12) to pass when turning. 
Dynamic articulation, according to former claims, 
is essentially characterized because the frontal wall of 

the box (2) has a stop (24) for the extended 
articulation. 
Dynamic articulation, according to former claims, 
is essentially characterized because the back wall of the 

yoke is designed to bend the articulation to a maximum 
angle of 90 degrees. 
Dynamic articulation, according to former 
claims, is essentially characterized because the lower 

end (14) of the bolt (12) , held up by pin (11), moves 
with this when the turn is made. 
Dynamic articulation, according to former 
claims, is essentially characterized by the fact that the 

upper, flat-bar has two unthreaded holes, one at each 
side, and two threaded holes, one at each side, all of 

them situated in the upper part of the box, with two 
 

internal pins (3), on the lower end of the box, holding 
up the outer and inner lids by bolts (21), screws, and 

plates.
