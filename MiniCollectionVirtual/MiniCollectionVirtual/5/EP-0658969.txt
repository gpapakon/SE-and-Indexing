<ABSTRACT>
A two level inverter with switching elements having a 
higher switching frequency than GTO thyristors provides a 

continuous control over substantially the full range of output 
voltages. The inverter comprises as its pulse modes an 

asynchronous bipolar modulation mode, a multi-pulse mode of 
an overmodulation mode, and a one pulse mode. Advantageously, 

the multi-pulse mode and the one pulse mode are arranged to 
be changed, to enable a continuous control of the output 

voltage and reduce tone changes in the magnetic noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to power conversion equipment 
which converts a direct current into an alternating current 
or vice versa, and in particular it relates to controlling 
of a pulse width modulation (PWM) inverter. An example of prior art inverter modulation methods 
has been disclosed in an article on "Evaluating the Recent 
Inverter Control Methods" which appeared in the "Denkisha 
no Kagaku", pp 14, Figure. 1, April 1993, published by the 
Denkisha Kenkyuukai. With reference to Fig. 2, in a traction motor inverter 
a constant control is provided to maintain a constant ratio 
between a magnitude of an output voltage and a fundamental 
frequency in such a region where an output voltage 
fundamental frequency is low, which region will be referred 
to as a variable-voltage variable-frequency region, whereas 
a frequency control is provided while maintaining a maximum 
voltage value in such a region where the output voltage 
fundamental frequency increases such that the magnitude of 
its output voltage becomes a maximum, which region will be 
referred to as a constant-voltage variable-frequency 
region. Since in the variable-voltage variable-frequency 
region an output voltage is regulated by pulse width 
modulation control, a multi-pulse mode is utilized in which  
 
a half cycle of its output voltage comprises a plurality of 
voltage pulses. On the other hand, in the constant voltage 
variable-frequency region, in order to maximize its voltage 
usage rate to minimize the size of the equipment, a one-pulse 
mode is utilized in which a half cycle of its output 
voltage comprises a single broad pulse. A prior art inverter which uses GTO thyristors as its 
switching elements, which will be referred to as a GTO 
inverter hereinafter, has adopted a multi-pulse mode 
according to a pulse count switching method which 
decrements by switching the number of pulses to be included 
in one cycle thereof with an increasing output voltage 
fundamental frequency as shown in Fig. 3. This is due to 
an upper limitation of several hundred Hz imposed on a 
switching frequency in the GTO thyristor. This method, 
however, involves such a problem that a magnetic noise 
which accompanies tone variation occurs thereby generating 
a cacophonic noise due to discontinuity between switching 
frequencies at the time the pulse count switching is 
employed. Further, there is another problem associated with the 
GTO thyristor such that a leap of voltage of approximately 
10% occurs between a three-pulse mode output voltage 
containi
