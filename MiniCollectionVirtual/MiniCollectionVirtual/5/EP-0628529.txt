<ABSTRACT>
Hydroperoxides are decomposed by contact with 
metalloporphyrin coordination complex catalysts in which 

hydrogen in the porphyrin molecule has been substituted with 
at least one nitro group and may be further substituted with 

other electron-withdrawing elements or groups, for example, 
halogen or halocarbons, or with hydrocarbon groups. Preferred 

catalysts are iron tetranitro-β-octaethylporphyrins and iron 
tetrakispentafluorophenyl-β-nitroporphyrins.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the decomposition of organic 
hydroperoxides with metal catalysts which provide desirably 
high reaction rates, to produce the corresponding alcohol. 
The catalysts employed according to the invention provide 
very high reaction rates at relatively low temperatures such 
as room temperature, in contrast to prior art catalysts 
which catalyze decomposition of organic hydroperoxides much 
more slowly and require elevated temperatures in order to 
achieve satisfactory reaction rates. Sanderson et al., U.S. Patent 4,910,349, disclose the 
preparation of t-butyl alcohol by the catalytic 
decomposition of t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), preferably in 
solution in t-butyl alcohol, in the presence of a metal 
phthalocyanine of a metal of Group IB, Group VIIB or Group 
VIIIB, for example chloroferric phthalocyanine and rhenium 
heptoxide-p-dioxane or oxotrichloro-bis-(triphenylphosphine) 
rhenium V. Various ratios of Fe to Re and Fe+Re 
to TBHP were studied  Sanderson et al., U.S. Patent 4,922,034, disclose 
decomposition of t-butyl hydroperoxide to t-butyl alcohol 
using a metal porphine catalyst, for example tetraphenylporphine, 
optionally promoted with a thiol and a 
heterocyclic amine. Sanderson et al., U.S. Patent 4,912,266, disclose 
decomposition or t-butyl hydroperoxide with an imidazole-promoted 
metal PCY catalyst, for example Fe(Ill)PCYCl or 
Mn(Il)PCY or VOPCY. Marquis et al., U.S. Patent 4,992,602, disclose a 
continuous method for converting isobutane to isobutyl 
alcohol including the step of decomposing t-butyl 
hydroperoxide to t-butyl alcohol, using a monocyclic 
aromatic solvent and a PCY decomposition catalyst. Derwent abstract (Week 8912, Other Aliphatics, page 58) 
of reference 89-087492/12 (EP 308-101-A) discloses 
decomposition of t-butyl hydroperoxide to t-butyl alcohol 
using a metal porphine catalyst such as a trivalent Mn or Fe 
tetraphenylporphine, optionally promoted with an amine or 
thiol, or a soluble Ru catalyst promoted with a bidentate 
ligand such as Ru(acac)3 promoted with bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine, 
or a promoted PCY catalyst such as a Mn, Fe  
 
or vanadyl PCY promoted with an amine, a Re compound such as 
NH₄ReO₄, a mercaptan and a free radical inhibitor, a base or 
a metal borate. Lyons et al., U.S. Patent 5,120,886, issued June 9, 
1992, which is incorporated by reference herein, teaches 
decomposition of hydroperoxides with metal ligand complexes 
in which hydrogen in the ligand molecule has been 
substituted with electron-withdrawing
