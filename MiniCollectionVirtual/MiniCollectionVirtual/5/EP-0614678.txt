<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for measuring electrical activity in the heart 
comprises an input amplifier unit (36) with a plurality of 

inputs to which poles of electrodes introduced into the 
patient are intended to be connected. The input amplifier 

unit comprises sensing means (48) for sensing the impedance 
across the amplifier inputs after connection of the 

electrodes in order to identify the poles which are in 
contact with the patient's heart, and a display (24) is 

connected to the amplifier unit to graphically indicate 
which electrode poles are connected and which are in contact 

with the heart.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for measuring 
electrical activity in the heart, comprising an input 
amplifier unit with a plurality of inputs to which poles of 
electrodes introduced into the patient are intended to be 
connected. Devices for processing physiological signals are previously 
known from e.g. US-A-3,994,286 and US-A-4,023,565. These 
devices are intended for use in ECG and EEG recordings and 
are specially designed to suppress certain noise signals and 
enable simple realization. From US-A-4,213,465, an electroencephalograph is known with 
switches arranged in a pattern reproducing the head. The 
measurement electrodes are attached with these switches to 
input channels, the position of the switches in the main 
representation of the head corresponding to the positions of 
the electrodes on the patient's head. In this manner, the 
position of the switches in the rendition of the head 
provides the operator with a good overview of electrode 
placement. The object of the present invention is to achieve a device 
for measuring electrical activity in the heart of a patient, 
the way the electrode poles are connected to the heart being 
graphically depicted. This object is achieved with an apparatus of the above-described 
kind with the features set forth in claim 1. Thus, the apparatus according to the invention is intended 
for measuring electrical activity in the heart, i.e. IECG,  
 
both spontaneous activity and any activity triggered by the 
apparatus. The apparatus automatically senses which 
electrode poles are in contact with the heart. This is 
appropriately depicted on a graphical screen. This graphical 
screen thereby provides the operator with a good overview of 
the coupling of the electrode poles to the amplifiers, shows 
whether an electrode is connected to the apparatus and 
indicates whether there is any break in any of the electrode 
poles. According to an advantageous embodiment of the apparatus 
according to the invention, an A/D converter's output 
terminal is connected, via an isolation interface, to a 
microprocessor for signal processing and a following control 
processor for controlling the graphical representation of 
the poles on the display. The isolation interface isolates 
the patient from other electrical equipment. According to another advantageous further development of the 
apparatus according to the invention, a potential sensed by 
a predetermined electrode pole serves as a reference voltage 
for all input amplifiers in the input amplifier unit. In
