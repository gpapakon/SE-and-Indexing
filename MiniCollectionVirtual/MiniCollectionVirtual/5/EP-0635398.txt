arranged a holder for the camera (4), characterised in that 
the holder for the camera (4), when the vehicle (1) is seen 

in plan view, is positioned so far beyond the vehicle or may 
be adjusted into a position so far beyond the vehicle (1) 

that the motor vehicle (1) is at least virtually completely 
outside the aperture angle of the camera (4), the camera (4) 

being oriented at least virtually perpendicularly to the 
road. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
support (3) may be attached to the motor vehicle (1) by means 

of a frame (2) of the roof rack type. 
A device according to either one of claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the holder for the camera (4) is
