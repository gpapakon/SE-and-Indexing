<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 5,6 fused bicyclic ring compounds 
useful as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists for the prevention 
of thrombosis. The most prevalent ischemic arterial heart disease states 
are related to platelet dependent narrowing of the blood supply 
such as atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, acute myocardial 
infarction, chronic stable angina, unstable angina, transient 
ischemic attacks and strokes, peripheral vascular disease, 
arterial thrombosis, embolism, restenosis following angioplasty, 
carotid endarterectomy, anastomosis of vascular grafts, and etc. 
These conditions represent a variety of disorders thought to be 
initiated by platelet activation on vessel walls. Platelet adhesion and aggregation is believed to be an 
important part of thrombus formation. This activity is mediated 
by a number of platelet adhesive glycoproteins. The binding 
sites for fibrinogen, fibronectin and other factors have been 
located on the platelet membrane glycoprotein complex IIb-IIIa. 
When platelets are activated by an agonist such as thrombin, the 
GPIIb-IIIa binding site becomes available to fibrinogen, leading 
to platelet aggregation eventually resulting in clot formation.  Heretofore it has been proposed to block these fibrinogen 
binding sites by the use of various therapeutic agents. For 
example, U.S. Patent No. 5,250,679 describes bicyclic 
nonpeptidyl platelet aggregation inhibitors having specificity 
for the GP IIb-IIIa receptor. There is a need in the area of cardiovascular and 
cerebrovascular therapeutics for alternative agents to those 
currently in use for prevention and treatment of thrombi. It is a discovery of this invention that certain novel 
bicyclic compounds block the GPIIb-IIIa fibrinogen receptor, 
thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombus 
formation. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the bicyclic 
compounds of this invention inhibit aggregation and are useful 
for the prophylaxis and treatment of thrombogenic diseases, such 
as myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral arterial 
disease. The present invention relates to novel 5,6 bicyclic fused 
ring systems functionalized with both an acidic and basic 
component that serve as antagonists of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor 
where said compounds are represented by the formula (I), and all 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, and prodrug 
derivatives thereof: 
wherein:
