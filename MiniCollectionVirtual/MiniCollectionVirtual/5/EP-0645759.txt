<ABSTRACT>
A magneto-resistance device comprising a stacked structure, said stacked 
structure comprising a non-conducting substrate (1) 

having a surface on which a multilayer 
structure (11) is provided, the surface being furnished with a plurality 

of grooves which are 
substantially mutually parallel, each groove comprising a first 

face (7) and a second face (9), 
all first faces being substantially planar and mutually parallel, the constituent layers of 

the multilayer structure being provided in a stack (13) 
upon each said first face in such a 

manner as to be parallel thereto, the thickness (t) 
of the stacks being such that each stack 

makes physical contact with each immediately neighbouring stack, the magneto-resistance 
effect of the multilayer structure being m
easurable by applying an electrical 
voltage gradient across the plane of the substrate in an in-plane direction substantially 

perpendicular to the grooves, thereby inducing a measurable flow of electrical current 
through the multilayer structure across the grooved surface of the substrate, the current 

thus flowing from one stack to the next in such a manner that, except in the vicinity of 
the region of electrical contact between immediately adjacent stacks, its direction is 

substantially perpendicular to the constituent layers of each stack.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magneto-resistance device comprising a stacked 
structure, said stacked structure comprising a substrate having a surface on which a 
multilayer structure is provided. The invention also relates to a magnetic head comprising such a magneto-resistance 
device. Magneto-resistance is that phenomenon whereby the electrical resistance 
measured along a given path within an appropriate material is found to be influenced by 
the presence of a magnetic field intersecting the material. The phenomenon can thus be 
exploited to transcribe probed magnetic field fluctuations into accurately measurable 
resistance variations within the material, thereby lending itself to application in fine 
magnetic field sensors and magnetic heads. Such magnetic heads are used for 
transferring information to and from a magnetic recording medium, such as a magnetic 
tape or disc. The magnitude of the magneto-resistance effect along a given path in a 
particular material is rendered by the formula: 
in which R₀ is the electrical resistance measured along the said path in the absence of a 
magnetic field, and RF is the smallest electrical resistance measurable along the same 
path in the presence of a variable magnetic field. The value of MR is usually expressed 
as a percentage, and is preferably as large as possible so as to yield maximum attainable 
sensitivity in sensor applications such as those mentioned above.  A magneto-resistance device as hereabove described is elucidated in 
United States Patent US 5,134,533, in which the stacked structure consists of a planar 
non-conducting substrate which is alternately provided with thin layers of ferromagnetic 
material (preferably Fe, Co or Ni) and thin layers of non-magnetic material (preferably 
Cr, V or Ti), the former being antiferromagnetically coupled across the latter and 
having an in-plane easy axis of magnetisation, the total thickness of the multilayer 
structure thus formed being of the order of a micron. The electrical resistance of such a 
stacked structure can be measured by applying a known electrical voltage gradient 
across the plane of the substrate, thereby inducing a measurable lateral flow of electrical 
current across the multilayer structure, the ratio of the said electrical voltage and 
electrical current yielding the value of the electrical resistance. The values thus 
measured, in both the absence and presence of an external magnetic field, can be 
employed to calculate the magneto-resistance effect using Formula (1) in the
