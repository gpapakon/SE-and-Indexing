<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an antenna apparatus which is compact in size and has a simple structure and two 
resonance characteristics. The antenna device of this invention comprises a conductive earth plate (2), a conductive 

radiation plate (1) disposed substantially parallel to the earth plate (2) through an insulator, a power feed line (3) 
having an earth conductor connected to the earth plate (2) and a non-grounded conductor connected to the radiation 

plate, and a passive line (4) connected to another junction (4c) spaced apart from a junction (3c) of the power feed line 
(3), and the earth conductor of passive line (4) is connected to the earth plate (2) while its non-grounded conductor is 

connected to the radiation plate (1). Since the passive line (4) operates as a short-circuit metal line at a low resonance 
frequency, a current distribution of about 1/4 wavelength exists on the radiation plate (1). Since the passive line 

operates as kept open at high resonance frequency, a current distribution of about 1/2 wavelength exists.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to small printed antenna devices which resonate at two
resonant frequencies. This invention is particularly suitable for utilization as a built-in
antenna for a small portable radio unit.Known examples of antenna devices which resonate at two resonant frequencies
include the planar inverted-F antenna disclosed in Japanese Pat. Pub. No. 61-41205
(Pat. Appl. No.59-162690) and microstrip antennas presented in "Handbook of
Microstrip Antennas" by J.R. James and P.S. Hall.Figure 1 is a perspective view showing the construction of the planar inverted-F
antenna disclosed in the above-mentioned application. This prior art example has
a first planar radiation element 21 and a second planar radiation element 22, and these
are arranged parallel to ground plane 23. The two planar radiation elements 21 and
22 are mutually connected by stub 24, and first planar radiation element 21 and
ground plane 23 are connected by stub 25. The non-grounded conductor of feed line
26 is connected to planar radiation element 21 at contact point 27, while the grounded
conductor of feed line 26 is connected to ground plane 23. The dimensions L1×L2 of
planar radiation element 21 differ from the dimensions L3×L4 of planar radiation
element 22, which means that they resonate at different resonant frequencies to give
a double resonance. In other words, the planar inverted-F antenna constituted by
planar radiation element 21 and the planar inverted-F antenna carried on top of it
resonate independently, and are fed by a single feed line 26.Figures 2―4 show examples of three cross-sectional structures of microstrip
antennas. In these antennas, first planar radiation element 31 and second planar
radiation element 32 are again arranged parallel to ground plane 33, but two feed lines
34 and 35 are connected to these (in the example given in Figure 4, only feed line 34
is connected). In these cases as well, the size and structure of the two planar radiation
elements 31 and 32 are different, and they resonate independently to give a double
resonance.Consequently, the thickness h2 of a conventional double-resonance planar
inverted-F antenna has to be approximately twice the thickness h1 of a single planar
inverted-F antenna. The disadvantage of the prior art has therefore been that an
antenna has to have a larger capacity and a more complicated structure in order to
obtain double resonance characteristics. Conventional double-resonance microstrip antennas have
the advantage that the two frequencies can be selected
