<ABSTRACT>
A dew or frost point temperature hygrometer (10) wherein a reflective surface (12), which is cooled by a cryogenic source (28) and held at the dew or frost point temperature by a servo control, reflects light from a light source (52) to a light detector (56). Very low concentrations of moisture or frost which condense on the reflective surface are measured very rapidly as a change in light reflected from that surface. No recalibration is needed throughout its exceedingly wide moisture measurement range of from about 1 part per billion to about 30 parts per thousand within a range of temperature from about -110  C to about 30  C.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: LOW MOISTURE CRYOGENIC HYGROMETERTechnical Field This invention relates in general to hygrometer apparatus which includes electrical circuitry to measure moisture condensed as dew or frost on a chilled mirror which is cooled by a cryogenic source, and to the method of using the same. More particularly, the invention concerns an apparatus and method for very fast and accurate measurement of moisture in a gas over a wide range of dew or frost point temperatures and gas pressures.Background Art Hygrometry, the measurement of moisture in gases, has always been important to industrial processes and atmospheric research, but recently the importance of such measurements has increased. As microelectronic feature sizes move into the sub-micrometer realm and super critical fluid extraction based on high-purity carbon dioxide becomes the accepted method for environmental and pharmaceutical extraction, the low parts-per-billion (ppb) moisture range is becoming the maximum acceptable level for moisture and other contaminants in specialty gases. The aerospace industry has similar moisture contaminant standards for space station systems. Atmospheric moisture measurements are important to understanding the role moisture plays in the chemistry of global warming and ozone depletion. There has been a continuing effort to increase the sensitivity, accuracy and response time of moisture analyzers, and especially performance of the dew point or frost point temperature chilled mirror hygrometers, to meet these challenges. As is explained in Bisberg U.S. Patent 3,623,356, dew point temperature hygrometers are frequently used to determine the moisture content of a gas sample. Typically a mirror is exposed to the gas sample and cooled to the dew or frost point temperature of the gas. Formation of dew or frost on the mirror is detected by means of a light source and a light sensitive detector responsive to light reflected from the mirror. The detector develops an error signal which is used to control the current to a thermoelectric cooler attached to the mirror, to maintain a predetermined thickness of condensate on the mirror surface. A temperature measuring device attached to the mirror is employed for measuring the temperature of the mirror, thus indicating the dew or frost point temperature of the gas sample. In this reference, the mirror, optics, and electrical circuit constitutes a thermo-optical servo system which functions to maintain a constant reflectance at the mirror surface, hence a condensate equilibrium at
