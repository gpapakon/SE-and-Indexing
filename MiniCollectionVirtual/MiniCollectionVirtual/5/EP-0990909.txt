<ABSTRACT>
Various program execution and monitoring controls, forming closed, independent units, are initiated centrally and on completion, return a mode (or system state) signal (S1-S7) to central control using a logic and AND system. Various program execution and monitoring controls, forming closed, independent units, are initiated centrally and on completion, return a mode (or system state) signal (S1-S7) to central control. A logic system is connected to both execution and monitoring control combining received signals using AND logic to produce mode signals for delivery to central control therefore initiating corresponding reaction(s) of the automatic analysis system.
