<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a straight portion of filling 
hose (15) of the high-strength flexible type which has one 

end permanently connected to the filling station (10) and 
the other end permanently connected to an elbow-like body 

(16) which acts as an element for coupling to the cylinder 
(B) to be filled. The elbow-like body has a manual ring 

connector (21) for coupling to the cylinder and includes a 
manually-operated valve (26-34) which allows, when the 

cylinder has been filled, to vent the pressurized gas from 
the filling hose (15) to facilitate the uncoupling of the 

cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for filling 
cylinders with industrial gases at high pressure, typically 
nitrogen, helium, oxygen, and the like, compressed at 
approximately 200 bar. The above mentioned industrial gases are currently 
loaded into work cylinders by means of a filling device 
constituted by a high-strength flexible metal hose which is 
permanently connected at one end to the filling station by 
means of a threaded connector tightened with a wrench and 
has, at its other end, a threaded-ring connector that can 
be tightened manually on the correspondingly threaded union 
of the cylinder to be filled. A first drawback of these known filling means arises 
from the fact that upstream of the filling station, which 
is substantially constituted by a valve cock, there is a 
check valve which is suitable to prevent the backflow of 
any residues contained in the cylinders to be filled which 
might contaminate the contents of the filling tank. The presence of the check valve causes the filling 
hose to remain under pressure after filling; accordingly, 
it become troublesome to disconnect the manually-tightened 
connector of the cylinder, forcing the operator to resort 
to the use of tools, wasting time and possibly damaging the 
connector. Another drawback of known filling means resides in 
that the filling hose must be arranged along an arc with a 
more or less sharp curvature in order to connect the 
filling station to the cylinder to be filled, since usually  
 
the union of the station is orientated vertically 
downwardly and the union of the cylinder is orientated 
horizontally. This, in addition to mechanically stressing the 
filling hose, with the risk of breakage, generates tensions 
in said hose, which is subjected to the high pressure of 
the fluid; these tensions can trigger dangerous 
oscillations of said hose that tend to remove it from the 
union of the cylinder and produce hazardous situations for 
the operator. A principal aim of the present invention is to 
eliminate these and other drawbacks and, within the scope 
of this general aim, said invention has the important 
object of providing a device for filling cylinders with 
industrial gases that facilitates the operations for 
disconnecting the cylinder once filled, substantially 
eliminates the danger of breakage and oscillation of the 
filling hose, and simplifies the operations for connecting 
the cylinder to the filling hose, especially by eliminating 
the need to pre-orientate the union of said cylinder with 
respec

<CLAIMS>
Device for filling cylinders (B) with industrial 
gases at high pressure delivered by a filling station (10) 

with a valve cock (11), characterized in that it comprises 
a straight portion of filling hose (15) of the high-strength 

flexible type which has one end permanently 
connected to the filling station (10) and the other end 

permanently connected to an elbow-like body (16) which acts 
as an element for coupling to the cylinder (B) to be 

filled, and in that said elbow-like body has a manual ring 
connector (21) for coupling to the cylinder and includes a 

manually-operated valve (26-34) which allows, when the 
cylinder has been filled, to vent the pressurized gas from 

the filling hose (15) to facilitate the uncoupling of said 
cylinder. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the flexible metal filling hose (15) is 
of the type 
provided with corrugations that accommodate an external 

belt (C) made of metal wire and the like. 
Device according to claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the elbow-like coupling body (16) has a first 

hollow shank (17) and a second hollow shank (18) which are 
arranged at 90o to each other respectively for coupling to 

the filling hose (15) and to the cylinder (B). 
Device according to claims 1 and 3, characterized 
in that the first shank (17) is rotatably mounted in the 

elbow-like body (16), with the interposition of sealing 
gaskets, and delimits, in said body, an annular chamber 

(24) which is connected to the hole of the second shank 
 

(18) for coupling to the cylinder (B) and to said manually-operated 
valve (26); the annular chamber being connected to 

the radial hole (172) of the first shank (17) by virtue of 
radial ports (173) formed in said shank. 
Device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the manually-operated valve (26) 

comprises a valve body (27) which slidingly contains a 
shutter (28) provided with an advantageously frustum-shaped 

head (28a) that is pushed by the action of a spring (29) 
and by the pressure of the gases so that it hermetically 

engages by contact a corresponding frustum-shaped valve 
seat provided on the bottom (30) of the valve body (27). 
Device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the shutter (28) of the valve (26) is 

extended by a pin (31) that is slideable in a guiding and 
retention hole (32) of the elbow-like body (16) and 

protrudes from said body to be engaged by an actuation 
lever (34) which is pivoted to said body and is suitable, 

when rotated, to move the shutter (28) so that it opens. 
Device according to the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the pin-like extension (31) of the 

shutter (28) has a prism-like cross-section so as to 
delimit, together with the walls of its guiding and 

retention hole (32), axial passages for venting the gas 
from the annular chamber (24). 
Device according to claims 1 and 3, characterized 
in that the first shank (17) is permanently coupled to the 

elbow-like body (16). 
Device for filling cylinders with industrial gases
