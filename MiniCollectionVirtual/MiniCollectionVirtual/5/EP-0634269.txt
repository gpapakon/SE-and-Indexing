<ABSTRACT>
Biaxially oriented film including a voided base layer 
consisting of a propylene homopolymer and a particulate 

voiding agent, and a non-voided outer layer of propylene 
homopolymer coextensive with the voided base layer, the 

particular voiding agent having a mean particle size of not 
more than 2µm. Such films have good opacity combined with 

good gloss for the surface of the non-voided outer layer of 
propylene homopolymer on the base layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns polymeric films and more 
particularly polypropylene films having good opacity and 
gloss. Polypropylene films can be made opaque by including an 
opacifying pigment and/or by including a particulate 
material in the polymer used to form the films and which 
gives rise to opacifying voids within the films when they 
are stretched. Typically chalk having a mean particle size 
of about 3µm is used to induce opacifying voids, stretching 
usually being effected biaxially and sequentially in the 
longitudinal and transverse directions. Voided polypropylene films are usually provided with one or 
more outer heat sealable layers. In addition to imparting 
heat sealability, heat seal layers do tend to improve the 
surface gloss of voided films, but their gloss is often poor  
 
compared with that of analogous non-voided films. The gloss of voided films can, however, be improved by the 
inclusion of a layer of non-voided polypropylene homopolymer 
between the voided layer, which is usually the core layer of 
the film, and the outer heat seal layer. The disadvantage 
of doing so is, though, that the opacity of the resultant 
films is relatively poor because the voided layer represents 
a smaller proportion of the total film thickness, and the 
yield of film, ie the area of film of a given thickness 
derived from a given weight of polymer, is reduced. The 
addition of a pigment, for example titanium dioxide, to the 
voided layer or to the non-voided layer can increase the 
opacity of the films, but it does not increase film yield. More recently films have been proposed which are said to 
have good gloss combined with high opacity by the use of 
chalk having a particle size of 1-2µm as the voiding agent, 
the films having outer heat seal layers and intermediate 
layers of polypropylene homopolymer. However, the yield of 
film is relatively low compared with films which don't 
include the intermediate layers, but omitting the 
intermediate layers leads to reduced gloss. According to the present invention there is provided a 
biaxially oriented film comprising a voided base layer 
comprising a propylene homopolymer and a particulate voiding 
agent, and a non-voided outer layer of propylene homopolymer 
coextensive with the voided base layer, the particulate 
voiding agent having a mean particle size of not more than 
2µm. Films in accordance with the present invention have 
exhibited high opacity combined with good gloss for the 
surface of the non-voided outer layer of propylene 
homopolymer
