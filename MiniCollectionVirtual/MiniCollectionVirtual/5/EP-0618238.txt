<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous crosslinking resin composition comprising 
(I) an aqueous resin dispersion and (II) a hydrazine derivative 

having at least two hydrazino groups per molecule are 
disclosed, in which the aqueous resin dispersion (I) is an 

aqueous resin dispersion obtained by emulsion polymerization of 
a monomer mixture comprising (a) not less than 0.5% by weight 

of an unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer, (b) not less than 
0.5% by weight of a carbonyl-containing unsaturated monomer 

containing at least one carbonyl group based on an aldo group 
or a keto group, and (c) not more than 99% by weight of other 

unsaturated monomer(s) copolymerizable with monomers (a) and 
(b), and the resin content in the aqueous resin dispersion (I) 

has been solubilized to a degree of at least 5% by weight by 
addition of an alkali and/or an organic solvent. The degree of 

solubilization of the resin content can be increased by (1) 
adjusting the amount of an alkali and/or an organic solvent to 

be added, and/or (2) adjusting the molecular weight of the 

dispersed resin by using a chain transfer agent in the emulsion 
polymerization for the preparation of the aqueous resin 

dispersion (I). The aqueous crosslinking resin composition 
containing the aqueous resin dispersion (I) obtained by using 

a carbonyl-containing copolymer dispersant is preferable. The 
resin composition easily undergoes a crosslinking reaction at 

room temperature to provide a crosslinked film having excellent 
adhesion to a substrate, well-balanced resistance to water and 

solvents, and hardness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an aqueous crosslinking resin 
composition which readily undergoes a crosslinking reaction at 
room temperature to provide a crosslinked film excellent in 
water resistance, solvent resistance, adhesion to a substrate, 
such as a metal, an inorganic material, a plastic article, a 
coated article, etc., and hardness. An aqueous crosslinking resin composition comprising a 
carbonyl-containing resin aqueous emulsion obtained by emulsion 
copolymerization of a monomer containing a carbonyl group based 
on an aldo group or a keto group and a hydrazine derivative 
having at least two hydrazino groups (-NHNH2) per molecule is 
known as disclosed, e.g., in JP-A-54-144432 (corresponding to 
U.S. Patent 4,267,091) (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"). The resin 
composition of this type is advantageous in that it has room 
temperature crosslinkability and is of one-pack type easy to 
use, but still needs further improvement in terms of film 
properties, such as adhesion to a substrate, and water resistance,  
 EP-A 0 219 046 discloses storage stable crosslinkable resin 
compositions obtained by reaction of (A) polymeric organic 
compounds having carbonyl groups in the presence of (B) monoketones 
and/or monoaldehydes with (C) polyhydrazides. 
EP-A 0 005 167 discloses binder for paints comprising (A) an 
emulsion of a copolymer, (B) an aliphatic dihydrazine compound 
and (C) a water-soluble salt of zinc, manganese, cobalt 
and/or lead. CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS volume 96 (1982) No. 
24 201 337w discloses aqueous dispersions of carbonyl group 
containing copolymer granules containing hydrazine derivatives 
for coatings having good strength. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
aqueous crosslinking resin composition which provides a  
 
crosslinked film having markedly improved adhesion to a 
substrate, well-balanced resistance to water and solvents, and 
hardness. The present invention relates to an aqueous 
crosslinking resin composition comprising (I) an aqueous resin 
dispersion obtained by emulsion polymerization of a monomer 
mixture consisting of (a) 0.5% to 50% by weight of an 
unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer, (b) 0.5% to 60% by 
weight of a carbonyl-containing unsaturated monomer containing 
at least one carbonyl group based on an aldo group or a keto 
group, and (c) 30% to 99% by weight of other unsaturated 
monomer(s) copolymerizable with monomers (a) and (b), and (II) 
a hydrazine derivative having at least
