<ABSTRACT>
An active isolator 10 with a closed-loop feedback 
control system 76 which uses an actuator 61 in parallel 

spring relation to a static load spring 36 to control the 
dynamic vibration transmitted from a vibrating device 30 

over a broad band frequency range. A collocated sensor 40 
is installed to sense the vibration of the isolated element 

20 and is amplified and fed, filtered and amplified again, 
reversed in sign and fed directly into the actuator. No 

external synchronizing signal or processor is needed. This 
simple active control is practical only where the combined 

series dynamic stiffness of the structure and vibrating body 
is much less than or much greater than the active mount's 

dynamic stiffness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the area of mounts for isolation of vibration
transmitted between a vibrating device and a support. Specifically, the
invention relates to a mechanical system for controlling active mounts according to the preamble of claim 1. Such a system is known from US-A-2 964 272.Generally, active mounts are known which include a spring
element and an incorporated powered actuator. In these devices, an input
signal from a sensor is processed and then fed to a powered actuator to
control the vibrational dynamics between a support and a vibrating body
with the goal of reducing the vibration transmitted from the vibrating body
to the support. Such active systems are taught in US Patent 2,964,272 to
Olsen, US Patent 3,566,993 to Leatherwood, US 4,796,873 to Schubert, US
Patent 5,052,510 to Gossman, and US Patent 5,067,684 to Garnjost. These
systems are usefull for adding dynamic forces at various operating
frequencies and can effectively cancel vibration emanating from a vibrating
device, such that little or no vibration is transmitted. Many types of
actuators have been developed for these active mountings as exemplified by
US Patent 4,600,863 to Chaplin et al., US Patent 4,669,711 to Beer, US Patent
4,693,455 to Andra, and US Patent 4,699,348 to Freudenburg.The concerns regarding the implementation of active mounts have
revolved around system stability and isolator effectiveness. The
conventional approach has been to take a signal indicative of motion from a
support that is desired to be isolated from a vibrating device. This signal is
then minimized via a control algorithm such as Least Mean Square (LMS),
frequency-shaped control, or H-infinity control. However, in order to design
the control system, the dynamics of the structure, and in some cases the
dynamics the vibrating element must be known fairly precisely. In systems
using these control signals to accommodate multiple resonant frequencies
in the control band width, the algorithm and the electronics required to
provide proper control become extremely complicated and expensive. With
active mounts installed in vibrationally dense or modally dense
environments, adding energy to the active mount at a frequency which
coincides with one of these modes of the engine or support, can cause the 
system to become unstable and, rather than improving vibration isolation,
can diminish it. Thus for these dynamically dense systems, it is important
to determine and account for these modes.The prior art devices have attempted to recognize these modes
